1832995,5,B00008AOX3,"I love this show!! I didn't get to watch all of season 1, so I am so excited to have this come out on DVD!! I got hooked on this show from the very first season, I was a freshman in high school when the show was in it's first season, and I loved growing up with Joey & Dawson and everybody. I cried and laughed and even took my PSAT's the same week they did!! I would recommend this show to anyone in high school, it's realistic and smart, and you'll grow right along with the group. I loved the first four seasons so much, I'm going to snatch them off the shelves the first day they're available... Can't wait for the rest of the seasons to come out. Buy it, watch it, I promise you it's worth every penny. You'll never regret it, it was the best show on television. (No offense, but after they graduated, it wasn't the same. I love this show, and it hurts to say that, but it's true.)",1043971200,2,886,4.0685714285714285
1832996,5,B00008AOX3,"This is an absolute classic season of television and should go down as a momentous event in American History.  What really drives it is Dawson and Joey's relationship.  Dawson's infatuation with Jen causes him not to see the forest through the trees, but hopefully true love shall prevail.  Their history, growing up as best friends, their innocence, living in a town sheltered from the harsh realities of the world, and their love, life meaning nothing without each other, all which rarely come together in real life are captured in this magnificent season.
Season One took the magic of the Wonder Years, combined it with the drama of Beverly Hills 90210, and kept it emotional.  However, Wonder Years and 90210 got better as the series went on, whereas Dawson's Creek peaked in its first season and seldom had any more episodes of this caliber.  At least there is less wait since this is the first release.  Note to DC writers: the series failed with Joey falling for Pacey's whole `feel sorry for me' routine to get her in bed and then dump her, which was a complete insult to her character.  However in season one she has more sense and he goes after a less innocent and older character, Ms. Jacobs, with very entertaining results.  Thankfully, Wonder Years did not have Paul sleep with Winnie or it may have suffered a similar fate.
For those who criticize this show based on commercials, watch the Pilot episode.  And if you still don't like it, than go back to 3rd Rock, Everybody Loves Raymond, or whatever's winning the grammys.
The DVD with digital quality picture and sound should nicely complement the already unlimited replay value of Dawson's Creek.  So pick this up ASAP, and Season Two when it comes out for the first few episodes and Rachael Leigh Cook's all too few appearances.",1043971200,13,1796,4.764516129032258
1832997,5,B00008AOX3,"I have been watching for this for a while, ever since I saw that ""Felicity"" dvds were out.  This is such an amazing show, and reminds me of all the drama that went on in those high school days.  The writing is great, the actors are great....this is just all-around an amazing show.",1043798400,,281,4.283018867924528
1832998,4,B00008AOX3,"The 12-episode mid-season pickup plus the first full season of Kevin Williamson's ground-breaking show single-handedly reinvented teen drama. They pushed the boundaries of acceptable content with teacher-student relationships, challenged us with teenagers who spoke like grad students, and gave us so many postmodern, intertextual references to 1980's pop culture that the show was as much fun for twenty-something adults as it was for kids going through puberty now. It was fresh, with unusual characters and storylines, and had enough unpredictability and pace to keep you engaged, all the while toying with the ""will-they-or-won't-they?"" Joey/Dawson relationship in the background. It was superb. Then came Season 3. Exit Kevin Williamson and enter the schmaltz - and it's been pretty much the same ever since. What once played like an adult's fond-yet-knowing fantasy of adolescence, now plays like an adolescent's woefully uninformed fantasy of adult life: a world in which Hollywood producers seek out aspiring student filmmakers; where downtrodden employees rise up and overthrow the boss; where impassioned speeches really do change people's hearts and minds; where having gay friends is cool, as long as we never actually see them kiss. It's like ""Seventh Heaven"" without God - unjustified by moral subtext, such mawkishness is horrific. While there are still rare moments of inspiration - like a devout grandmother taking a weekend fling in Vegas with her black boyfriend, or the brilliant one-liners Audrey is lucky enough to score most weeks - it's almost wholly degenerated into a sappy, lame and agonizing ritual for those left wondering if Joey and Dawson will ever end up together. But by now, does anyone really care?  For my part, I just fantasize about a series finale in which they're all drowned in the creek. So buy this box set and treasure it - it will take you back to the good ol' days when the show still had some guts.",1043712000,35,1946,5.197452229299363

But, not for a  female teacher having sex with a male student? And having that be ""normal,"" on the show.  The conversations between the female lead and her best friend about masturbation, was just not comfortable as a subject to me.  Kind of like when you are a kid and you don't want to think about your parents having sex, like ew, gross, lol.  All this kids coming of age stuff, and trying to integrate their sexuality was just strange.  I am 57 years old, a mom and grandmother, parent, artist, adult.

1833087,3,B00008AOX3,"I am going to copy and paste this in every season of Dawson's Creek. Understand I am a fan of 90210 the originals series, Vampire Diaries, The Originals, NCIS, The 100, Utopia, Bones, Continuum just to name a few. I ordered all 6 seasons of Dawson's Creek and began watching them. I understand this is an old T.V. series and I am playing catch up, but there is a reason I have never heard of this show. Pros I enjoy watching shows with the ins and outs of growing up and all the pain it brings, this show does that to a certain extent. The show also brings into light some of the pains homosexual kids face when growing up. Now for the Cons. At best this show was nothing more than a copy cat of 90210 as a matter of fact 90210 was actually mentioned in the show. You will also notice that you can skip a season or two and never truly miss anything.  You know when you sit down and start watching a bad movie but you force yourself through it hoping that it gets good soon ""I found myself in this very situation on more then one occasion"". The love triangle between the three main characters killed the series for me, much like the first couple of seasons of the Vampire Diaries. However, the Vampire Diaries had a story behind each show outside of the love triangle that somewhat held it together. The story line always came second to the love triangle in Dawson's Creek and for the most part the story lines were garbage. Some more bad news for the show; you would be hard pressed to find one 15 year old in high school with a vocabulary of a 30 year old English professor, but not in this show they all do. If it weren't for the last season 2 stars at best.  I recommend this series only if you have time to waste.",1425081600,,1717,4.2

1833103,5,B00008AOX3,Great Show! I grew up (through high school and beyond) watching Dawson's Creek and I have to say it is one of my favorite Teenage Dramas.

This show is innocent, captivating and familiar.  I cried just as hard watching the series finale as I did the first time, even though I knew the whole time how the series ends (there are multiple touching scenarios)!

No one at 15 is that honest or that  capable of expressing their feelings so honestly to anyone and everyone who will listen. Besides that their is a character that almost anyone type of person can relate to I think its unrealistic approach to real teen problems is what made it so popular.

1833194,5,B00008AOX3,"This is the best season of the series in my opinion before it turned the Melodrama up to the nth power and started placing it's characters into overly contrived situations. I actually stopped watching at the end of Season 3 regularly and would catch an episode here and there for the reminder of the series. What makes the season so great is that it very much stands on it's own. It introduces you to these great characters, provides strong story arches for all of them and then brings them all to a satisfactory conclusion along the way. This season almost had a kind of magic to it, the characters are never really the same after this season, and most, specifically Dawson get extremely annoying afterwards. Dawson's Creek kind of reminds me of the Rocky Series, they had one excellent movie that they should have stopped at and it would have been perfect, however they had to continue on making movie after movie, or in this case season after mediocre season...",1330300800,,964,4.676470588235294
1833195,4,B00008AOX3,"I was in my late teens/early twentys when the Dawsons Creek series started on the WB. I enjoyed the show and was very drawn into the characters and the plot of the series. Due to my work schedule the last two season's 5 & 6 were hit and miss for me, i didn't get to see them all, and i missed the two hour series finale. now in my mid 30's  I decided to revisit this show and complete watching the entire season. So i ordered them all and just finished watching season one today. My opinion, I can now reflect back and see how i was drawn into this series, Alas i have matured in the past 14-15 years and what was once a edge of the seat weekly event for me is now a little dull.. DONT MISTAKE ME, i still enjoyed watching season one this week, its just lost some of its luster from my younger years. I can see huge holes in the plot and some of the acting is underdone/overdone..yet still entertaining. I was truly hopeing to recapture the magic of when this show first aired.  If you can put aside your grown-up reasoning and just re-think like a 16 year old this show will delight you.. I don't want to be too harsh, its still a fun show to follow and thats why im giving it 4 stars, I still have the next 5 seasons to watch and the 2 hour ending, maybee my opinion will rise to five stars after getting to see it all..  but for now im ok turning it off and watching the news between episodes... 2 pennies.  OH the soundtrack is still awesome !!  i had a few of those goosebumps moments durring a few episodes with the music.. pretty cool.

Update: Im going to put this out there (as if anyone truly cared about Amazon tv-series reviews) but here we go anyways,  I have all 6 seasons and season 1 is a little corny but it pulls you in. Season two hooks you pretty hard and you in for the long haul. Season three is pure energy and in my opinion the best Season of the series, season 4 is good up till about halfway through, then it falls on its face. The end of season 4 and all the way up till the last two episodes of season 6 are completel letdowns.. (But you must watch them to understand the 2 hour season finale) the last two episodes of season 6 are pretty good and as mentioned the finale is a tear jerker and a great way to finish the show.  I was sad at the end of the 2hr special just knowing there wasn't anymore.. Im not going to revisit this series yearly but im glad i own them. maybee every 5 years i will rewatch the series..",1328140800,,2445,4.058091286307054
1833196,5,B00008AOX3,"Dawson's Creek may be the most under appreciated show in history. No offense to fans of Freaks and Geeks and My So-Called Life (I love those shows too) but DC never had respect from critics or most of the general public. Most have called it another take off of Beverly Hills 90210. I dare you to watch the first two episodes of the first season and say that again. Of course the show was not realistic but I think it was brave enough to not try and be (that awful word) realistic. The show was about dreams and fantasies that we all have when we are young and the show actually made us feel like our dreams had come true, even if it was only for 45 minutes an episode.

Dawson Leery is a young filmmaker who worships Steven Spielberg and is trying to cope with growing up (and people telling him to grow up). He brings a natural sensitivity that is rare in most characters in teen shows. He brings a kindness and innocence and of course, he's lost, tortured and uncertain about where he stands in a world that's unfair and cruel. ""I'm going to be a filmmaker. It's my life's ambition, it always has been"". This is his exact words in the pilot episode and by season 3, he is faced with harsh realities that he questions his passion and eventually, he gives up. Of course by the end of season 4, he finds inspiration again to work towards his dream from the help of a bitter old man who was once a filmmaker and gave up too. He also finds the subject for the film that eventually gets him recognition.

Of course, the show deals with love, loss, angst and sometimes it even gets to the point of absurdity but it never stays far from the truth of our own fears when we are that age. Some episodes could be ridiculous which is why most say that ""Of all the shows that captured what being a teenager is really like, Dawson's Creek was not it"". True, it did get a little over the top by season 3 but it always stayed true to its subjects and themes. That being young is hard and we never know what will happen to us in life. This is Dawson's journey and same with the other characters on the show. Hearts are broken, people lose trust in each other, we don't always win and even some people lose their lives. It may not portray it in the most, as you say, realistic way but it wasn't trying to be completely accurate, it was trying to inspire us to not give up on our dreams and passions.",1325116800,,2382,4.2214912280701755

However, I think that some of the subject matter shouldn't really be viewed even by teenagers.  *************semi spoiler************I wasn't impressed, as a mother, with the affair between  Pacey and his teacher, nor that Joey (female) climbs into Dawson's window at night to sleep with him, sweetly platonic at the outset.  While all of that is fairly innocent and helps develop the conflict of the program, I don't find it appropriate.  I do, however, like the small town setting, but as I said, the maturity level of the program is geared to a younger group of people and I was bored.",1291161600,2,765,4.891472868217054

1833220,5,B00008AOX3,"Dawson's Creek is probably the second greatest teen drama series second only to 90210.  The first season argueably has the best episodes of the entire series.  Mainly because of the simple fact that season one deals with the struggles of growing up and realizing things like soul mates, love and self worth.  But also the fun stuff about young, hanging out with with your friends.  Watching films and throwing scractistic remarks at the television.  For me, personally I relate with Dawson and Joey's characters more then anything.  I relate with Joey because as of right now, I'm in love with my best friend and she doesn't see it, so I can relate to those feelings of frustation.  Also, I can relate to Dawson because I want to move to Miami or New York City to begin a film career and I'm a dreamer and also being critized by my best friend for that.  Now, as far as my title.  If anyone who has all six seasons and I'm not including the series finale because that I thought was very well done.  You will notice after season two which is the season that Kevin Williamson the creator of the series left the series.  The series slowly but surely ""tanks.""  The first two seasons, had emotional depth and scenes that even though they seemed like the ""filler"" scenes (or scenes being put in to fill up space in the episode) it still made sense and it had a point for the episode.  The episodes in seasons three through six.  Just seem really dull and with the exception of some episodes.  A parent's death in season four, an episode entitled ""the longest day"" in series three.  The series just seems really boring and drags on.  But if you want to see a series that reinvented the teen drama.  Buy seasons one and two of Dawson's Creek.",1178928000,3,1734,4.485623003194888

1833243,5,B00008AOX3,"Every so often, a group of elements comes together to create a production that fully realizes its potential. Such is the case with Dawson's Creek - The Complete First Season.

In a world in which the media relies increasingly on sensationalism and ""anything goes"" to clock maximum TV viewer hours, Dawson's Creek was created in the spirit of excellence in every realm. The script is about real issues we all faced in adolescence. As these issues, conflicts and challenges are universal to all of us, it is easy to get drawn into this series because the production is believable and the themes are well thought out. Golden Boy's perfect world is shattered by his mother's affair. The girl from the other side of the track discovers she can be so much more. And a cynical teen realizes she is not so different than her grandmother. While Dawson Leery (James Van Der Beek) is the main character, it is really Joey Potter (Katie Holmes) that anchors the series with a vulnerability, directness and honesty that Diane Keaton gave us in the 1970s. This production is passionate, disciplined and crafted with love. And the music? Adam Fields brilliantly took the ambiance of Capeside, the personalities of the leading characters and the overall dramatic intent of the series and composed music that magnifies the emotional impact of everything.  The soundtrack (which I bought) is a good example of what good music can do to a production.

Dawson's Creek goes against the grain. It gives so much without trying to be too much. It is tasteful, entertaining, at times funny. And the themes touch us all. The acting is incredible. That's why it was so popular in the late 90s and remains so today.",1157587200,,1687,4.810344827586207

1833245,4,B00008AOX3,"Ahh, DAWSON'S CREEK, the ultimate fifteen-year-old soap and guilty pleasure of teenagers (and their parents) all over the country. It enjoyed a hearty six-year run on the WB, boasting such trophies as first gay kiss (concerning Jack) and most famous virgin (Dawson, until - wow - the fifth season). In syndication it's doing fairly well. It's always going to be etched into the memory of America, mostly because of the parodies, but also because it was a plain good show, easy to relate to, with likable characters and the various situations the characters got themselves into. Oh, look, Dawson and Jen have a school project together, and they just broke up! And hey, what do you know, isn't it lucky that all the main characters have the same classes together all the time?

The first season was fairly bland: thirteen episodes with a smattering of sexual tension, various embarrassing scenarios, a pregnancy, infidelity, and a new girl - all the building blocks necessary for a good New England-based teen melodrama. It took the pieces needed and worked with it, creating characters that are sometimes annoyingly Hollywood (in the sense that they deliver perfectly witty, adult-like monologues without taking a breath) but affable all the same. Their problems are ones you yourself might have had at fifteen, so sit back, relax, and dive into the creek - just know that other seasons have done better, in the sense of being just a wee bit more dangerous plotwise.",1152230400,,1465,4.955284552845528

I grew up with this show and I was deeply affected by how they would pick out songs with lyrics that matched the scene that was happening.  The music was a strong focus of mine for this show and to change over most of the catalog was entirely disappointing.  I have also read that they do not intend on ever releasing a collection with all the original music due to legal reasons.  So I have no intention of owning this collection again, which is a shame, since I adored this show.  You can still catch re-runs on TV, though, and I would recommend, if sampling this show, to catch the high school episodes as opposed to the college episodes.  The writing is better in the high school episodes and the characters are more enjoyable, especially Pacey, (my favorite).

Forlorn Dawson spends one half of the season fawning for the attention of Jen, and the other half whining about how he lost her. Joey spends her days dreaming about Dawson-either hating or loving him. Pacey, after his fling with educator Tamara Jones, becomes an uncool pimp. Jen is constantly pondering whether or not her and Dawson were meant to be (along with putting up with her strict Grams).

Every issue is a dramatic, played-out problem for these overly matured ""teenagers"", who look down on anyone who have the slightest different piece of insight.

They are 15 and have this great friendship, with underlying complexity. This season explores their friendship and feelings for each other. Most of the season Dawson is chasing Jen (Michelle Williams). Dawson's best friend Pacey (Joshua Jackson) also provides a lot of comic relief on the show.

1833251,5,B00008AOX3,"The year is 1998. For eight years Beverly Hills 90210 had been the hottest address on the box. Creator Darren Star had really taken a shine to school life for teenagers. It would take another two years at the dawn of the new millennium, when 90210 no longer felt like home and viewers wanted to expand their viewing options, and move out to a different location. It was 1998 when Darren Star would again put a twinkle in every man's eye with `Sex and the City', but this time with a group of woman's adult perspectives on dating and life in New York City. You heard right. `Sex and the City' - A candy confection with class for girls and guys to go all gooey over, either dating, or cuddling up on the couch each week with married couples.

However, 1998 was also the year television viewers took a vested interest in the seemingly simple lives of four close knit friends in the coastal town of Capeside. Away from the city, we find solace in a creek. It was in this setting when creator Kevin Williamson posed this very intriguing question

""CAN FOUR FRIENDS GROW UP WITHOUT GROWING APART?"" That happened to spark the imagination of millions everywhere and give hope to lovelorn teenagers. Enter Dawson Leery (James Van Der Beck), a purely romantic, movie making dreamer, with an optimism to capture any girls' heart, but also a tendency

to blurt out inappropriate dialogue at a seconds notice without

contemplation.

Then zoom in on childhood friend and neighbour Joey Potter (Katie Holmes), who lives across a creek that is Dawson's whole world. A world Dawson seems forever lost in if it wasn't for Joey's regular routine of rowing from her dock to Dawson's, then climbing in through the window instead of the door,

and just enjoying each others company on Dawson's bed, watching movies late into the night, before saying goodnight and innocently sharing the same bed together.

It is then that the series of Dawson's Creek begins with the realisation from Joey that her body is changing. She is getting breasts that were never there before. Puberty has arrived and you'll go through thirteen aptly numbered episodes to signify the beginning of teenage life. Thirteen - A chance to see life at age fifteen through four different sets of eyes.

When life couldn't possibly get more confusing, along comes Jennifer Lindley (Michelle Williams) out of a bright yellow taxi cab, just like off the streets of New York, where she's come to start a whole new life on the creek. With all eyes in her direction Dawson and his friend Pacey Witter (Joshua Jackson), are in awe of this heavenly earth-bound angel beauty, with legs for miles and a seductive dancing wind playing at her skirt, which suggests more delights on offer that would raise anyone's eyebrows and keep any young teenagers heart all a flutter.

If this is not enough to comprehend add to the mix the parents of Dawson, Gail Leery (Mary Margaret Humes), and Mitch Leery (John Wesley Shipp) and their healthy sex lives. Jen's church conscious grandmother Evelyn ""Grams"" Ryan (Mary Beth Peil). Then to round it all off we have Joey's sister Bessie Potter (Nina Repeta), to deal with any family issues.

So there we have a basis for the fun filled episodes to come. With even more characters to come in the six seasons that followed Dawson's Creek debut.

Fans and new comers to this show will find hot storylines between a teacher and student.

There is a Beauty Contest episode that raises worldwide alarm bells for parents everywhere after the chilling murder of JonBenet Ramsey Boxing Day 1996. Any beauty contest episode harks back at me to this event. Felicity season four does the same with the episode ""Miss Conception"" and Felicity's participation in a beauty pageant, as well as a lot of other maternal feelings in me. You'll also find lovable Noel (Scott Foley) from the 1999 debut of Felicity in Dawson's Creek as Cliff in a number of fun episodes.

There is an awesome episode that wouldn't be like a real school without Detention, inspired by John Hughes The Breakfast Club. We also get to meet in my opinion the devilishly sexy, but totally lovable trouble maker Abby Morgan (Monica Keena). I can't help but always get lost in the deep depths of Abby's eyes... A character better explored in season two.

No teenage show would be accurate without the importance of a Road Trip. A topic explored more in Felicity. Plus it wouldn't be right of Kevin Williamson with such film writing hits as the Scream trilogy and I Know What You Did Last Summer, not to have The Scare episode.

Decisions are what life is all about and so is a fitting final to a very short first season of Dawson's Creek. The shortest season I've ever seen!

Dawson's Creek starts and continues in season two. Oddly enough, there is no Freshman year for these young teens that we are able to see. So I think a Freshman year prequel story could be just what fan fiction creek fans need.

Having never really seen this show properly until DVD, and debating over whether or not to watch it since first owning and loving Felicity, I can say things only get better for the Dawson Creek gang.

Dawson's Creek does have a L.M Montgomery Anne of Green Gables feel about it to me, especially when it comes to the relationship between Jen and Grams. I also know from seeing fleeting episodes or parts of shows, that Michelle Williams would be my favourite character.

What we will see is how cleverly so many characters intertwine and change over the six season run of Dawson Creek, and the important issues that face any young person at some time in their lives. It is so great to know we can go to TV shows for answers that we might not know the answers to for guidance. It is a mixture of great storylines and real honest feelings that

make this show, and others memorable. Few could match the quality of Dawson's Creek. The level of sophistication in the dialogue and open discussion of sexuality is refreshing to see, and something I admire. It always leaves us hoping that one day we can all be so comfortable with ourselves that we'll know we won't get judged by others, or potentially those we love. That only comes with time and all a part of growing up. That's what Dawson's Creek is here to discuss and that's why it will remain special for years to come.",1121299200,2,6300,4.653465346534653

1833284,5,B00008AOX3,"Well first off I'd like to say, I didn't watch this either when it first aired, but I wish I had, it's such a great show, and most of them either made me wish I was there in CapeSide, or cry like ""The Kiss"" and ""The Beauty Pageant"" , the stereotypical love-trianlge but with a twist, and most of the things that happen to Miss Potter, Miss Lindley Mr Witter and Mr Leary are things that have happened to me, or my friends, it's really trippy, and after i saw the first episode when it was re-running this past spring (when i finally got to sit down and watch it) On TBS, I knew it was gonna be my favorite show, I believe the first one I saw was either the one where Dawson is trying to get jen back and goes to the carnival with Mary-beth and double dates with Jen and cliff, while joey and pacey go looking for snails, or the one where they all see that weird guy at the conveience store then go to Jen's place where he ends up trying to scare everyone like he always does.

But I don't own this DVD, I watched it at my friends place the first 5-10 episodes and they were great, and I wish I had a credit card so i could get it on here, but since I've seen it, i thought I'd write a review about it, cause it was just too great, wish I had seen them all though, i only saw the first 5-10 episodes on season 2-3 I haven't seen anything before the carnival/snails episode, and REALLY want to :(

anyways, it's a great DVD and if you're thinking of a Great christmas gift, or just something that's great for watching pleasure get this, cause you'll regret it if ya don't (I do LOL)",1103760000,2,1580,4.060897435897436

The hip soundtrack adds to the appeal - who will ever hear ""I Don't Want To Wait"" again and NOT think of Dawson and Joey?

1833287,5,B00008AOX3,"when dawson's creek originally i didn't watch a single episode of it, but then the summer after the show's finale i was looking for a show to watch and there was absolutely nothing on. so i looked at the tv guide and the only show i had even heard of was dawson's creek, so i decided to turn it on. i was instantly mesmorized by the characters' wit and plotline. every day i would watch the two episodes airing that day and i found myself thoroughly enjoying every moment of the show.

so then i went out and bought season 1 on dvd, and it is amazing! kevin williamson is an incredibly talented writer and the cast really brings the best out of the script. there is not a single episode in this season that i don't enjoy. even the extras are fabulous; they have interviews with kevin williamson (the creator and writer of the first 2 seasons), paul stupin (the producer), james van der beek (dawson), katie holmes (joey), joshua jackson (pacey), and michelle williams (jen). i would recommend this dvd set to anyone over the age of 12. . .even my parents enjoy this show!!!",1093737600,2,1073,4.446700507614213
1833288,5,B00008AOX3,"Dear Amazonians,
Dawson's Creek is a real gem in the realm of dramas that are geared toward the teen and young adult audiences.  This season begins the show by introducing us to is characters and their diverse personalities.  Joey is a quiet and insecure young woman, while her childhood friend Dawson is a Steven Spielberg wannabe  who is lost in is own world of fantasy.  Through this season, and the rest of the series, these two characters explore themselves and the various forms of relationships that exist between them.  Sometimes they date each other, and sometimes they are just happy to share intimate moments as friends.
My favorite episode in this season is ""The Scare,"" as it really shows of Dawson's quirky sense of humor.  It plays out just like a scary movie (but of course, Kevin Williamson had directed the Scream series and I Know What You Did Last Summer!), as Dawson sets up his home as a haunted house.  Pacey finds an estranged woman at a convenience store, and brings her to Dawson's place, only to find out how weird she is.  As the group tells ghost stories, the woman horrifies the crowd by telling them that is not what everyone thinks she is.  The group listens intently as she tells of how she carries a big knife in her purse, and likes to slip open peoples throats to see how far the blood will spurt.  She and her demented boyfriend really stir things up for the guys when her boyfriend comes over to the house in a rage, trying to get at his girlfriend.  Everyone thinks that he is a fanatical killer, trying to keep him out of the house.  Finally his girlfriend leaves somewhat peacefully with him, leaving Dawson and the gang confused over his real intentions.  Joey plays a mean joke on Dawson, pretending she is dead, and Dawson is left in a state of panic.  Later, the two ask each other what they would do had they ever really died, and they use this as a moment of bonding.
One thing that stands apart about this show is how young the actors are when they begin the series.  We really get to see them mature as the show progresses through its seasons, while they keep their basic demeanor.  We meet new characters including Jack McPhee and his sister Andi.  This really is a series that I can watch time and time again while keeping myself interested in the character development and the developing storyline.",1087430400,7,2350,4.557142857142857
1833289,4,B00008AOX3,"For me the 2nd season is the best season but this one is the runner up for me. And the best episode of all is in this season (Beauty Contest). But i didn't like the DVD version. It isn't the best quality and there not enough extras. And i wished there was the ""Run Like Mad"" credits which is from the Europian version. (cause i think it suits the series better). And there are some really boring episodes like ""Hurricane"" and ""Baby"". The ""Pilot"" is awesome. If u like this show it is a must have but not the perfect season nor a perfect DVD.",1087171200,3,541,4.161904761904762
1833290,5,B00008AOX3,"I did not get to watch Dawson's Creek when it first aired on TV, but I wish I did. This might be the best written television show I have ever seen. Essentially, this is a witty drama about childhood friends who are at the age where they start noticing the opposite sex. Not only did the writers give the characters good material to work with, but I have to admit that Katie Holmes is drop dead gorgeous. But what makes Holmes such a good actress is she can do so much more than just deliver the dialogue. Holmes is so good at facial expressions, biting her lip or looking up with her puppy eyes. Pacey offers some great comical relief. I found myself at times tearing up, only to be laughing a few seconds later. Who wasn't nearly in tears at the end of the pilot, only to burst out laughing at the ""Usually in the morning, with Katie Couric"" from Dawson. I challange anyone who watches the pilot not to sit down and watch the rest of the season. I would highly reccomend the first season of Dawson's Creek.
There is one other more personal reason why I love this show. When I found the show on TBS, I was suffering from depression. This show did something to me, changed me in some way. It broke through and touched my heart.
My only complaint is I wish their was a widescreen version, with a picture that utilizes all the resolution DVD's can give. And more extra's. I liked the two 8 minute mini-shows on the disc, but I would have loved an hour with the cast, and a behind the scenes special feature which showed out takes. This is a show that deserves to be in a collectors special edition set.",1085184000,4,1599,4.298013245033113

This is a 4-disc set With all 13 episodes from the first season which premiered in 1998. The only episode which isn't so great for me is ""Double Date"" its OK but not as exciting as ""Detention"", ""Detention"" is my favourite episode apart from ""Pilot"". If you are one of the shows fans, you should not miss out on the first season! It is a vital un-missable part of the whole show!, Season two is full of surprises aswell.

Dawson's Creek first aired when I was just starting high school, so it definitely had some meaning to me in that sense.  I felt like I grew up with each of the characters on this show.  I love watching the first season on DVD because it takes me back to my high school days and reminds me of some great memories I had.  This is an awesome show that I think anybody would like regardless of when you went to high school.  The characters deal with real issues that a lot of people can relate to.

1833330,5,B00008AOX3,"During six seasons, I watched ""Dawson's Creek"" and followed the character's growth until the end of the show. I'm not a teenager anymore (I'm almost 30 y.o.), but I really believe every person who likes to watch TV programs with quality should give a chance for Dawson's Creek. This is one of the best TV shows ever made, with an incredible cast and a sensitive director. The plots were always great and it is a kind of surreal thing to see boys and girls, who are 15/17 years old, having arguments like people of my age now.
As a true fan of the show, I must admit that this first season was not the best one. But you have to consider the first season is always a kind of lab, where show directors and producers are developing the main plot, presenting the characters and ""testing"" the show, to find out the viewers acceptance of it.
On first season, Dawson finds out his home is not as perfect as he thought it was. Pacey discovers his own sexuality, having an affair with his school teacher. Jen arrives from New York, to live in Capeside with her grandmother, a very religious and severe woman, opposed to jen, who used to have a profane life in the big apple. Joey, sweet as always, becomes confused, when she starts to fall in love with her best childhood friend and neighboor, Dawson, who dates Jen, breaking Joey's heart.
The first season reserves classical ""Dawson's Creek"" moments, such as the ""Detention"" episode,in which the interesting character Abby is presented and the gang stays stucked in school on a saturday, in a reference to the ""breakfast club"" movie. There's also the first season finale, with the kiss between Joey and Dawson, that every viewer was waiting since day one. Very touching and beautiful!
Dawson's Creek is a masterpiece, an unforgettable journey through teen life, with all of its doubts, insecurities, innocence and friendship. Make it last forever, buying all the seasons, which will be soon released in DVD format!",1072569600,,1955,4.719298245614035

*Pacey and Mrs. Jacobs risky relationship
*The episode called Detention, just like The Breakfast Club (classic)
*When Joeys sister, Bessy has the baby
*The struggle of Dawson's parents with a recent affair
*The language used as if they are like 35 years old
*Dawson's road trip with Jen's ex, Billy and Pacey

*Dawson and Joeys long awaited first kiss! :)

So as soon as I found out this DVD was released, I ran out and bought it.  Despite the overly expansive vocabulary, it reminded me of the 14 year old I had long forgotten about.

1833355,1,B00008AOX3,"Recently I was laid up for a week after surgery and with so much time on my hands, I decided to sit down and immerse myself in the world that is Dawson's Creek.  My mother had bought the DVD to watch with my sister and I had endured pleny of rave reviews so I figured why not.  I found myself giving it a try because I liked James Vander Beek and Katie Holmes in the various movies I had seen them in.  They are smart individuals and I was hoping they would transcend the usual teen genre.
Unfortunately I was severly dissapointed.  I made it midway through episode three before I became disguted and frustrated.  The characters of Joey and Dawson are unique and refreshing in their ideals and thoghts but that is about the only good thing I can say about it.  The plots are ludicrous and filled with holes.  I noticed a few dispariging things right away.  First off, I can understand that everyone lives next to each other but the way everyone keeps running into each other is ridiculous.  For example in episode one when Pacey runs into Ms Jacobs on the dock in the middle of the night.  The dialogue is witty but it is unrealistic for 15 year olds.  Who talks like that?  The series revolves around who likes who which just gets old really quick.
I don't understand why this got all the acclaim it did.  It was boring and contrived.  For a better stuff of a similar nature try My So Called Life.  This is done better and is less time involving.  For more originality try Buffy, which deals with the same issues yet manages to be much more interesting and entertaining.
Bottom Line:  People who like watching annoying whiners deal with the same problems week after week should love this.  Katie Holmes stalkers will also be satisfied.",1060300800,7,1736,4.457142857142857

I miss DAWSON'S CREEK now that it is over and I will watch and re-watch season 1 DVD until Season 2 is available.  Then I'll re-watch both of those until Season 3.

1833402,5,B00008AOX3,"The saga of Dawson's Creek is a long drawn out process of a group of kids who try to find themselves in the romantic drama of love, perception, and confusion.  The story begins with a new girl in town named Jen who comes from the big apple.  Everyone thinks that she has big ideas because she is from a big town, but Dawson sees her for the first time and falls in love with her.  This then brings up the tension between Dawson and his long time best friend Joey.  Joey begins to become confused about her relationship with Dawson and when her hormones begin to kick in so does her attitude leaving a fun-filled aura of jealousy and confusion.  The other main character of the first season is Pacey Witter who has been lack luster in his efforts to succeed in school.  He is more interested in his teacher and what they would be like in bed together.  The opening disc of this series is where the fun begins and I would recommend it to any of the hopeless romantics who have skepticism about finding the right person and those who just like romance period.

Now, I'm normally not a fan of these types of shows, but this show has really caught my attention and is now up there with my favorites. I hope they put out DVDs of the other seasons as well.

1833404,5,B00008AOX3,"In the Spiring of 1998, I started watching what was to become, one of my generations deffing Televion Shows.  I started Watching Dawson, because it was on right after, my all-time favorite Television show ""Buffy th Vampire Slayer"" but in no time at all Dawson found its place in my heart.  I have to admit that when the first seaosn aired I was 10 years-old and in the 5th grade.  I didn't understand most the show, and today can't beleive that my parents allowed me to watch it.
But now (As i am 15 and a sophomore, well i was until yesteryday), as I watch the first season on DVD and the other 5 season on TBS, I relieve that even though unrelistic at times, Dawson's Creek is the perfect show for a to watch growing up.  It has many lesson, cleaverly hidden inbetween the weekly who's dating who.  The First Season is clearly the best.  Unfortunatly The shows got worse each year, except Season 6 was far better than the almost unwatchable season 5.
But now as the show is over, and I know where my favorite characters are in there lives 10 years later (Even though my one of my two favorite characters are now 6-feet under), this season feels like an old book that I can open whenever I wan't.  The end of the series also brings a hole new prospective onto the season.  I don't think anyboy can watch the first season, then the Series Finale, and then the first seaosn again and not cry.
One more food for thought to mention is, that if you look at the 1998 - 2000 television seasons, what where the top teen shows?  The Answer is Dawson's Creek, Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Feliciy, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, Rosewell, and Popular.  Now in 2003 three of the shows are long gone: Felicity, popular, and Rosewell, and the final 3 which where bigger, better, and more crically acclaimed show: Dawson, Buffy, and Sabrina end in the same month.  Now all we have are DVD's, and i know that at least one person will keep these disc's close to there heart, because I know no matter where i am in my life, I will always remember how i grew up just by poping in a disc.",1055548800,3,2063,4.346354166666667

To respond to the finale, I disagree, the ending was very clear.  Pacey was her adult love and Dawson, while he would always remain special, was her childhood ideal.

It's just boring [stuff].  Buffy showcases excellent dialogue, great humor, and even violence occasionally.  If you want something of this teen genre, then why not the best.  Don't buy second rate garbage, buy Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  You won't regret it.
P.S. If you already own the Buffy DVD's and your thinking about buying Dawsons Creek, don't.  Get a movie, I recommend Citizen Kane.",1054684800,4,559,5.054945054945055
1833439,5,B00008AOX3,"It's funny how you associate a cetain past-time in your life with the songs and TV shows that were popular at the time. When I was 16 I watched the entire first season of Dawson's Creek with an ex-girlfriend of mine. Much to my surprise, I got hooked in like a little teenage girl (which I constantly ragged on myself for) and ended up watching most of the second and third seasons as well. So the show was a little unrealistic... For example, when Pacey dates his English teacher and she never gets locked in jail, or the constant coaching that Dawson gives his parents and that other teens seem to give other adults in the show on a regular basis. Most 15/16 year olds don't have it together better than the adults around them. I guess a show needs to be a little unrealistic though, otherwise it wouldn't be telivision. With that aside, the show was amazing! It flawlessly captured certain moments that all teens go through on their journey to adulthood. The excitment and confusion of love, the strong bind between best friends, the times when you know things are changing but you just can't figure it out, it's all here in the first season. Although seasons 1 through 3 were all great, season 1 stood out and captured those moments that can make you smile or make you cry. When I popped this DVD into my player, it brought back memories of being 16 again. It wasn't just because I was watching Dawson and company struggle through adolescence again, it reminded me of where I was in my life when I used to watch this show. If you watched the first season back in 1998 like I did, go get yourself this DVD. You won't be disappointed. I graduated highschool and never got around to watching seasons 4-6, but if they come out on DVD maybe I'll revert back to my girly ways from when I was 16 and soak up the drama.",1054598400,16,1815,4.404761904761905

My only criticism and regret is that the series is now over after six seasons, and only the very first season is available for purchase.  In my opinion, they should atleast have the first four seasons out on DVD by now.

1833488,4,B00008AOX3,"Dawson's Creek just completed its six-year run on the WB and the first season was recently released on dvd.  The show was the creation of Kevin Williamson, who at the time of the show's debut in January, 1998 was riding high thanks to the success of his writing efforts on Scream 1 & 2 and I Know What You Did Last Summer.  The show revolved around four teenagers (two boys & two girls) in the fictional Massachusetts town of Capeside.  The show's four leads were played by unknowns.  James Van Der Beek plays the title role of Dawson Leery, a sensitive film buff, whose dream is to be a big Hollywood director.  Katie Holmes is Joey Potter, Dawson's friend since they were five and is innocent, yet hardened because of the death of her mother and her father being incarcerated.  Joey begins to realize that she has feelings for Dawson beyond just friendship and the ebbs and flows of their relationship is what the entire run of the series would be based on.  Joshua Jackson is Pacey Whitter, Dawson's best friend and lovable screw-up, who creates a potential major controversy by having an affair with one of his teachers.  Michelle Williams is Jen Lindley, a bad girl from New York City who is set to Capeside to live with her Grandmother (Mary Beth Peil) who lives next door to Dawson.  Jen provides a spark in the group dynamic as Dawson is attracted to her and will take her out which sparks jealousy in Joey.  The show is quite different from your average teenage high school drama.  The characters dealt with real issues like Dawson's mother's infidelity and the break up of his parent's marriage and the confused feelings of love that all teenagers feel.  The characters didn't speak in regular high schooler lingo and were incredibly self-analytical, almost clinical breaking down their emotions.  The show is a bit wordy, but the young actors are all fresh and new and bring a charming naivete to their roles.  All four lead characters would become instant teen idols and the show's success single handedly saved the floundering WB network which was considering folding until Dawson's Creek exploded with audiences.",1053043200,13,2126,4.773224043715847

1833490,5,B00008AOX3,"It wasn't that long ago that I avoided the WB like the plague. In part because of just plain bad shows like Happily Ever After and 7th Heaven, but mainly because I dismissed the teen dramas the WB is known for (and which Dawson's Creek is the poster child for) as silly soap operas. In fact, even after starting to watch some of the WB's ""teen dramas"", I still sneered at the Creek, which continued to seem pretentious and silly.
Then the WB reran the series premeire, and I watched. And quickly enjoyed, to the point of yelling at Dawson for being so dense, and Joey for not kicking Jen's butt for ""stealing"" Dawson. So, now interested in what happened next, I bought the Season 1 DVD set.
The episodes are very good, and the core four-Dawson, Joey, Pacey, and Jen-are genuinely likable (if flawed) characters. Additionally, the supporting and recurring characters (Dawson's parents, Gail and Mitch; Joey's sister, Bessie; Grams; Pacey's brother, ""Deputy Doug"", and father; Joey's father; and Capeside's resident ice queen, Abby Morgan) add nicely to the main cast, providing more than a little bit of conflict along the way.
The extras, while a bit sparse, are informative, but don't even begin to illustrate the hype that once existed with Dawson's Creek. Still, if you want to relive the past, or discover something new, this set is certainly a good place to look.",1052784000,,1368,4.8008474576271185

Whether it's Pacey's underachieving, Dawson's slavish devotion to blockbusting mega-directors, orJoey's ladder-climbing ability, I feel like someone has observed my journey through life, and crafted a televised adaptation of ""cousinpaco's creek.""
And now I can bask in an uninterrupted marathon of Season One. The classics reside within: Gail's infidelity, Pacey's liaison with teacher Tamara Jacobs, Bodie...all in crystal-clear digital presentation.

1833545,5,B00008AOX3,"I love shows and movies about teenage life & that it's really not as easy and that the things we do aren't stupid. This show shows everything teenagers go through from their first date, first kiss, breakups, having your heart broken...It's a part of life. Dawson's Creek's first season was solid. Not one episode was a miss. Something new and exciting happens with every episode, and the cast is stellar amazing. You couldn't ask for a more talented cast. From start to finish, season one is brilliant. During this season, Dawson and Jen go out & encounter a really hard breakup, Joey realises her feelings for Dawson and vice versa. And in the end, Joey has to face a decision on if her and Dawson stand a chance & whether or not she should take the offer she has to go to France. This season has alot of beautiful moments, but the season finale is heart wrenching. What's also great about this show is that every single character has their own storyline & we get to see every one of their journeys. We really learn alot about the characters and their lives. Dawson's Creek is wonderfully written and directed and features an awesome soundtrack. Be sure to pick this up! This is an amazing show, and you will be missing out on alot if you don't get this!!",1049587200,10,1256,4.5131578947368425

It also explains some of the things I didn't get and I can't wait to buy Season Two. Season One is just Amazing.",1049587200,,285,3.5396825396825395
1833547,4,B00008AOX3,"I managed to avoid watching ""Dawson's Creek"" until the gang graduated from high school; students in my Popular Culture class always want to write about the show for their television unit so I had to get with the program.  That means that when the first season finally became available that I already know that the title character is going to make it through his high school years with his virginity intact.  Consequently, watching the first season of the series that was created by Kevin Williamson and which put the WB on the map is not about the big question of whether or not Dawson is going to (and if he does with whom).  Basically it is about a group of high school sophomores struggling to maintain their relationships despite their almost constant attempts to destroy those self-same relationships.
The secret to enjoying ""Dawson's Creek"" is to realize that Dawson Leery (James Van Der Beek) is the least interesting member of the core group.  This is not to say that he is boring, but when the entire series starts with him coaxing Joey Potter (Katie Holmes) into his bed because they always sleep together on movie night while remaining oblivious to the fact that the girl across the Creek is (a) in love with him and (b) a righteous babe, it is clear that this guy does not have a clue.  Throughout the first season Dawson pretty much revalidates that idea at each and every opportunity, especially once ""new girl"" Jen Lindley (Michelle Williams) literally moves next door.  Meanwhile, loveable loser Pacey Witter (Joshua Jackson) is putting the moves on Tamara Jacobs (Leann Hunley), the gang's new English teacher.  This last aspect becomes the proverbial exception that proves the rule because otherwise this coming of age drama would, rather ironically, be about teenagers NOT having sex.  In that regard it almost seems like Williamson was trying to come up with a sexual generation-gap show in the grand tradition of ""Family Ties,"" because in that regard Dawon's parents are embarrassing their son to death.  But then it turns out his mother (Mary-Margaret Humes) has been having an affair and once his father (John Wesley Shipp) gets to the last person to know stage the destruction of the young Leery's psyche is just about complete.  Besides, in the final insult to injury, he only gets to audit his school's film class.
The first season finds Dawson pursuing Jen, but the heart of that season is Joey's transformation from tomboy to potential Miss Windjammer, which reaches its high point when she sings ""On My Own"" in Episode 111, ""Beauty Contest.""  The soul of the first season is clearly Pacey, who can never believe that he is as charming as he really happens to be; even at this early stage of the game there is a clear suggestion that he and Joey are kindred spirits.  Not surprisingly given who created the show, the best episode in this collection turns out to be ""The Scare"" (Episode 109), which has Dawson pulling out his bag of tricks to scare the gang on Friday the 13th.  The characters are likeable, the scripts are halfway literate, and the fact that Dawson and Joey reminds me of Anne Shirley being oblivious to the fact that she and Gilbert Blythe are going to live happily ever after is not a bad thing for ""Dawson's Creek"" to have going for it either.  The DVD extras are halfway decent as well, with a retrospective featurette and some commentary from Williamson and executive producer Paul Stupin.",1049587200,3,3439,4.787162162162162
1833548,3,B00008AOX3,"Ok I admit I was sorta into Dawson's Creek when first came on. I'd watch it here and there but it's nothing special. I think Kevin Williamson, the writer of Scream's talent was wasted on this show. He had a suspense show that was more his style that was only on the WB for only like 5 weeks. I wish that lasted longer than Dawson's Creek.
 I find the show way too mushy and the dialogue to be completely unrealistic, I mean what teenager uses such big words ? The show does have some moving moments and it does have a fast paced engery too it as well despite being a drama series. Sitting through the opening credits is torture though lol. If a [criminal] is ever caught, to get him to talk the best way is to play the theme song to this show. The best thing about the show is the always cute and charming Katie Holmes as Joey Potter. James Vander Beek is annoying as Dawson. He's always whining or jealous about something. I don't know if he's like that anymore though because I only watch the show once in a blue moon when nothing is on other than American Idle lol. Anyway Joshua Jackson and Michelle Williams are also good, it's just Dawson I can't stand, lol. I'm not sure if anyone would actually wanna go back and watch the old episodes of this show. But hey if there's a hurricane or a bad snow storm and you are incredibly bored, then maybe you might wanna....watch the Buffy or 24 episodes on dvd instead, lol.",1049500800,,1420,4.278810408921933

Featuring classic moments such as Dawson telling Joey how often he walks his dog, to the Detention episode in which it all almost falls apart for Joey, up to incredible Season Finale which is so heart-wrenching and so conclusive that it could have ended the whole series.
Season 2 of ""Dawson's Creek"" was also excellent and Seasons 3 and 4 were kinda good until it lost its direction a bit in Seasons 5 and 6. The Season you have really gotta have though is this one.
The DVD has 2 featurettes. One has interviews with Creator and Executive Producer Kevin Williamson, along with Executive Producer Paul Stupin. The other which was shot during the time that the first season was filmed has cast interviews. There are also 2 commentaries, one on the Pilot episode and one on the Season Finale.

I can totally relate to the characters. I am a technical director for UNC Charlotte's television station and my dream just like Dawson is to be a film director. It has been so inspiring to watch Dawson succeed in the film world. It gives me hope and asspiration. I also relate to Joey. When I saw Joey sing on stage with the live band it inspired me to do the same therefore a month later I did. Since I live in North Carolina I was also given the chance to be an extra on the show.

1833601,5,B00008AOX3,"I'll be the first to admit that seasons 5 and 6 of Dawson's Creek have not been great. However, the first four seasons WERE great, and then some. The first season introduced us to Dawson Leery, Joey Potter, Pacey Witter, and Jen Lindley, in addition to other characters, in the fictional town of Capeside, Massachusetts.
A lot of people who watched the first two, three or four seasons of Dawson's Creek have probably stopped by now. But they should still buy this DVD set because the first season was amazing. From the pilot, to the Saturday Detention episode, to the Beauty Pageant, to the first kiss shared by Dawson and Joey in the season finale, the first season was definitely memorable.
The first season writers, led by Kevin Williamson, knew how to write. They knew how to be dramatic without going overboard. They knew how to make viewers laugh and how to make them cry. They knew just how to get to that place in our hearts that would make us fall in love with this show. And even if you aren't in love with the show anymore, like me, this DVD set is definitely worth buying. It will bring back memories that you have long since forgotten, and it will instill in you a feeling of nostalgia and love for Dawson's Creek.
I hope that the remaining seasons are eventually released on DVD, as I will miss Dawson's after its May 14, 2003 two-hour series finale (which, by the way, should be as great as the first two seasons since it was written by Kevin Williamson). I am very happy this will be released soon and I can't wait to relive the first season.",1045958400,64,1559,4.473684210526316
1833602,5,B00008AOX3,"Usually, TV shows get better with time.  With Dawson's Creek, I have to say it's the opposite.  Season One was so unpredictable, with witty jokes, and now I think it is a little ridiculous.
I have watched Dawson's Creek from the beginning and I have to say although things have changed the show always seems to go back to where it was before. By saying this, I mainly mean Joey and Dawson. I think everyone has had enough of this story and it has caused many people to switch off from this show. Aother thing which annoys me about this show is that Joey has slept with all of the boys apart from Jack because of the obvious reason, that he is gay. Jen is the worst who hasn't she slept with. It isn't a very good example for teenagers and also they don't look like teenagers.
Joey Potter-She is the good girl, very innocent, or so she thinks. Over the years they have tried to make her a bit of a rebel also every male who walks past her likes her but it doesn't work because of the way she is. She is the smart one of the group from Cape town. She has been friends with Dawson since a very young age and so through out the many series' they have been on and off. She is not much of a role model, I think she is a very weak character, she never does anything adventurous and always has to do everyhing right, she should live life on the wild side for a change. She was never very girly in the beginning of the how but now she is a mature young woman. Her father is in jail and also her mother died so her only family that we see is her older sister. Now as the series has moved on we have now seen her move from high school to college now where she is doing well and where she became friends with Audrey.
Dawson Leery-I never really got why the show was named after Dawson because personally I hate him I think he is the most dull teenager ever and I feel he has no change in his life he just stays the same. The show isn't really based on him and without him in the episodes the show is a lot better, without his problems. In the current series' his father has died and his mother has had a baby. He is another person who is very intelligent and he is interested in the film industry being a director. He has loved Joey for ages but in the past he has had problems falling out with friends over her. When Pacey went out with her that caused a huge argument because Dawson used to go out with her and since Pacey was his best friend he felt it was wrong that his best friend should date his ex. He also hurt Joey in the last series by going out with Jen and then losing his virginity with her causing a huge argument between Jen and Joey. There are lots of arguments in this show but they are a close group of teenagers.
Pacey Witter-The cool guy in the group always flirting with the girls and getting through tricky situations by talking his way out of them. I think Pacey is a really good character and he is strong, many storylines can be made about him and he is never as weak or boring as Dawson. He doesn't take life too seriously and lives it as every day goes by. We never see Pacey's family much either I can't quite remember why this is. He used to date Jack's sister Andie for a while but then she slept with someone else. She left the show because she had mental problems. He then had a thing with Jen but then fell in love with Joey which lasted for a while too. Now in the current episodes he dates Joey's college room mate Audrey, they are a perfect couple and look cute together they are also both wild and have the same sort of personality, so they get on well.
Jen Lindley-The mature girl of the group who is very sexually active and knew all the facts of life before everyone else. She is 'easy' and is not much of a girly girl quite a tomboy and rebel. She never keeps in her mind what she thinks and lets it all out. She used to work on the college radio for a while giving advice to students with problems and helping them out with advice. She was thrown out of her parents house and so she lived with her grandma who is like a grandma to all of the group. They stay at her house when they want and she is good to them. She is now best friends with Jack I think she understands that he is gay and maybe the fact she can have a male friend who she knows isn't attracted to her. She has been out with Dawson, Pacey but not Jack. She also has had many boyfriends quite different personalities.",1045526400,7,4413,4.08881199538639

I am without a doubt buying this DVD. What makes me even more excited is that I just bought a DVD player, Ahhh, let the show begin.

I remember when it was a mid-season replacement on the WB, back when I didn't have the WB in my cable service. I'd heard so much about this show, but I couldn't watch it. I was so excited about seeing it, imagine how happy I was when UPN started playing the episodes. It was like they had answered my prayers! I immediately fell in love with it. It was like nothing I had ever seen before. Beautiful kids cruising around high school, spouting big words and clever phrases at each other. You had the inspiring filmmaker (Dawson) and his tomboy best friend Joey. Joey was so sweet and so beautiful, but Dawson's sight was set on the new girl from New York, Jen. Then, there was Pacey, the slacker of the group who, even though he was not supposed to be as smart as the rest, still liked to use the big words. Put them all together, and you get one of the best first seasons of any show.
I mean, who did not sympathize with Joey? Katie Holmes did such a wonderful job with that character, I almost wanted to reach into my television, pat Joey on the shoulder and say, ""It's ok. He'll come around. He'll see how cool you are."" Who has never been in love with someone who is in love with someone else? Anyone could relate to Joey. Actually, anyone could relate to any one of these characters. In the beginning, they were believable high school kids. We loved them. We wanted to be like them. That's how good this show was.
Now, I haven't watched the show since, well, since before they graduated high school. That is because I think it has lost the fine quality it held in the first couple of seasons. But the  more current seasons don't ruin the first one. Nothing could. There were so many fine moments, it would be hard to keep track of them to list them all. But just to name a few: the episode that is a take-off of ""The Breakfast Club""; the beauty pageant episode where Dawson finally notices Joey's beauty; the episode that foreshadowed the future pairing between Joey and Pacey (in my opinion, the REAL soul-mates); etc., etc., etc. Must I go on?
I am so glad that this is finally coming out on DVD. I will admit, I am a little ashamed to admit how excited I am about it, since the show is no longer considered cool. But remember when it was? I do, that's why this DVD WILL BE MINE.",1045008000,10,2291,4.290993071593533

1833606,5,B00008AOX3,"At long last, a return to the vaunted glory days of Dawson's Creek, the series that reinvented the teen drama genre.  Here we see the ""Core Four"" (Dawson Leery, Jen Lindley, Joey Potter, and Pacey Witter) as they grapple with everyday emotions in their own unique and inimitable styles. They run the gamut from love, anger, jealousy, grief, and struggling with self-identity.  Williamson's vision was both fresh and refreshing, sweeping aside the vestiges of the oft-overdramatic Beverly Hills, 90210 or the childish Saved By The Bell.
Everything that made the Creek a place to visit without fail on Wednesday nights is epitomized in the first season, and the heart-wrenching season finale sealed by the first kiss between Dawson and Joey would set the stage for the seasons that followed.  While the show has floundered since Williamson's departure, it still remains a staple of the WB Network despite this, its sixth and final season.  We've seen the best and the worst this series had to offer, and we've remained loyal nonetheless.
My hope is that we savor this DVD and the ones representing the seasons that follow.  We can sit back and reminisce about a show that had no equal during its heyday, and soften the blow of the May 14th series finale.

""Dawson's Creek"" is my show, what can I say, I adore it. It has really great dialogs, witty humor, great acting by the to-be-superstars Hollywood youth and it was created by one of the most promising American directors - Kevin Williamson (you've seen the ""Scream"" trilogy, haven't you?).
The first season of ""Dawson's Creek"" isn't just a TV show, it's a great example of how a TV show should be like. It's drama, it's comedy, it's romance, and it's real-life problems that everyone of us encountered when we were growing up. I think that is the key factor that makes it so enjoyable. Plus, Katie Holmes is a total fox. :-)

Next, although it was nice to see the beginning of these characters again, I had forgotten how cheesy and adolescent the series was. And much of the acting is mediocre, as best. I recently binged on the original Gilmore Girls series and much of it still holds up today, with superb acting. But it was often times difficult to watch the main character, Dawson Leery, played by James Van Der Beek, from an adult perspective. I won't bother re-watching the rest of the series, but it was a fun trip down memory lane.",1483315200,,687,4.496

7981097,5,B00008AOX3,"Dawsons Creek appeared strategically at a time when most Millennials were entering puberty. The coming of age series arrived just in time to put our young world into perspective. The show broke barriers while addressing teenage promiscuity, substance abuse, mental health, and infidelity. With its mature content and provocative plots, critics could even argue that the writing was a bit advanced for its targeted audience. Looking back, Id have to agree. The dialogue was a bit exaggerated and overzealous for such young characters.

Heavily influenced by pop culture, the fan favorite incorporated smash hits from popular 90s artist. The writers always found a way to pay homage to cult classics with clever analogies and references. Dawson's Creek is a nostalgic revisit to the 90s and reminiscent of a time when life was carefree. I don't know a single Millennial who wasn't wrapped up in Dawsons love triangle or the slew of adolescent conflict unfolding on Capeside. A playful series with an amazing group of actors, great on screen chemistry and even better music. Dawsons Creek will forever remain a WB favorite. I recommend the first season to anyone who missed out on all the drama.",1482105600,2,1192,5.112820512820512
