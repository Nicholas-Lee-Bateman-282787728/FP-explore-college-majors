2517534,4,B000EGDCGO,"This was a very good DVD.  The documentary was especially interesting, although the man who was speaking about his horse riding failed to mention that Valentino when he was shooting the scene at the beginning of The Eagle, where he leaps from one horse to try and stop the carriage from running away, Valentino did this originally but the horses were travelling so fast that he wrenched his arm, fell and was then kicked by one of the horses, which was why it was suggested that he not do that scene again in case he was more seriously injured.  As all fans of RV know, he was a supremely skilled horseman and was against using a stand in.  The other thing that was a disappointment, was the fact that it was not Valentino singing the Kashmiri Song.  This I did not understand as it is easy to listen to his recording on You Tube.  The Four Horsemen was a great film.  Quite long but there was a quite in depth story to tell and it was easy to become absorbed by it.  Although it was quite a tragic story there were flashes of RV's humour.  The quality of the film was a little dark but this didn't detract too much from the enjoyment of the film.  A very enjoyable DVD and very reasonably priced.  A must for all RV fans.",1308873600,7,1222,4.273913043478261
2517535,4,B000EGDCGO,"The DVD in question depicts various aspects of his life incorporating
scenes from some of his more prominent films.
It is of some interest to devotees of the silent screen and will make
acolytes of younger individuals who are not familiar with the Sheik of
Araby.",1195171200,4,263,4.739130434782608
2517536,5,B000EGDCGO,It's amazing to be able to watch Valentino in one of his greatest roles in The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. I consider this DVD the biggest deal of the century - a great documentary and a great movie at this incredibly low proce! The movie is not restored but the image is very watchable. We should not complain. I only wish that the name of the movie would be included in the title of this DVD or in the amazon's description.  I was searching for this movie for quite some time and could not find it. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse is considered a bonus material on this DVD and I found out about it purely by chance. What a discovery!,1156896000,18,645,4.2439024390243905
2517537,4,B000EGDCGO,"This was an interesting documentary on Valentino. I was not aware of his background prior to becoming a film star. There is also quite a bit of info. re: his life while in Hollywood. The other features of this DVD, (the only known recording of his voice and the film that made him star) only enhance this documentary.",1156204800,8,317,4.482758620689655
2517538,4,B000EGDCGO,"This is a good all around documentary if you want to learn something about Rudolph Valentino.  They cover a lot of ground and while to the seasoned Valentino fan they present nothing new, it's a nice solid piece of work.  While I consider myself seasoned, I still found this to be very entertaining.

The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse is much more problematic.  A great film like this really needs to be seen in the best possible print.  This one, unfortunately is not it.  Dark and murky it looks to be from a 16mm print that had no clean up.  But, beggars cannot be choosers until Turner Classic Movies and Warner Brothers deems it fit to release their exemplary print restored by Kevin Brownlow and David Gill under the auspices of Photoplay Productions.

The one real glaring and unexcusable error on the part of the producers is the Valentino recording of the Kashmiri Song.  You hear the correct recording on the menu screen.  Unfortunately, when you select the option to hear Valentino sing, the Kashmiri Song plays, but that recording is NOT Valentino's.

In any case, I'd recommend this to anyone with a passing interest in Valentino, it's a very nice diversion and 100% better than the documentary Delta produced on Douglas Fairbanks.  Doug deserved much better!",1149811200,31,1274,4.820276497695852
2517539,5,B000EGDCGO,What a pleasant surprise to have a great documentary and a feature film all on one DVD...and at such a great price! Valentino lovers will love this DVD!,1149552000,10,152,4.464285714285714
2517540,5,B000EGDCGO,"My compliments to Delta Entertainment for producing another fine quality DVD at budget cost in their documentary/biography collection series.  After enjoying their production on Douglas Fairbanks Sr, I was looking forward to this documentary and silent film featuring the legendary Rudolph Valentino, and was definitely not disappointed.  Like his contemporary Douglas Fairbanks, who left us his swashbuckling adventure legacy, Rudolph Valentino also had more talents and attributes than most people realize.  This 80-minute documentary with plenty of great footage from Valentino's films and good commentary from various experts gives much more insight into the man behind the image of `sex symbol' and `dark lover'.  Far from being a mere `gigolo', as he was also called, I was surprised and impressed to learn than he mastered four languages, had a degree in agriculture and was a professional dancer when he made his break in the movies.  Like Fairbanks, Valentino also had quite a different (and perhaps much more intriguing!) image before his famous films of the 1920s, namely often playing a villain in various disguises.  The documentary covers all the highlights of Valentino's short life and career, and is a very good introduction to those not so familiar with this icon of the silent era.  The bonus material on this disc has more treats:  besides a filmography and list of 3 books written by Valentino, there is a 1923 audio recording of Valentino singing ""The Kashmiri Song"".  This is a special treat because there is no recording of his speaking voice, and only two known song recordings, this being one of them.  My first impression was simply `WOW!'  And my second thought:  what a great shame he died so young because he could have offered the world so much more in the sound era as well, perhaps becoming a singer and all-round performer as well.

Alas, we will have to make due with what Valentino left us in the silent era, and a sample of the style that made him so appealing and legendary is seen on side 2 of this DVD, namely in ""The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse"".  This 1921 silent film is quite a lengthy (over 2 hours) and involved drama about the sad fate of a family torn apart in World War I.  The `Four Horsemen' refer to the Biblical account in Revelation/The Apocalypse, symbolizing the omens of our time:  war, famine and pestilence, then death.  These themes were close to the hearts and souls of audiences in the years after the `Great War' as it was called then, and no doubt many people could relate to the tragedy and broken family depicted in this film.  Valentino's role stands out and is, in fact, the pivotal character: first a rich and spoilt philanderer who has an affair with a married woman, but when war and tragedies strike, his life takes another course.  Valentino's intense and passionate expressions are evident in many scenes, and we can really see - over 80 years later - why he captivated audiences with his style and acting talent.  The film itself is in good condition and only a little blurry at times, and the fine orchestral musical score seems to be an earlier recording made for this film.  While not the same standard as the KINO label, for instance, I'm still giving this DVD the full 5 stars for the quality material and quantity (over 3 hours of viewing) for such a low budget price.  Well done, Delta!",1144195200,43,3372,4.817708333333333
8109147,4,B000EGDCGO,Thanks,1523232000,,6,6.0
8109148,5,B000EGDCGO,"Nice, informative dvd with lots of features and the first starring role that made Rudy famous.  I am an enthusiastic Rudolph Valentino fan and I hope to collect lots of movies and books about him.",1517702400,,196,4.6
8109149,5,B000EGDCGO,"This set contains both the excellent documentary THE GREAT LOVER and the best print of FOUR HORSEMEN OF THE APOCALYPSE (1921) that I've been able to find on DVD.  It's not as good as the print restored by the British Film Institute but it's worlds better than the murky prints found on other DVDs available today.  Valentino wasn't intended to be the star of FOUR HORSEMEN, but it made him a star.  The film was intended as a star vehicle for Alice Terry, even though she's really a bit too old for her role.  Alan Hale and Nigel de Bruilier are other stars who will still be familiar to fans of silent films.  The great Rex Ingram directed.

The film is reasonably faithful to the best-selling novel by Vicente Blasco.  Madariaga is the patriarch of an Argentine cattle empire.  He has two daughters, one of whom marries a Frenchman and the other a German.  Madariaga prefers the French family, particularly his grandson Julio played by Valentino.  Madariaga intends to leave the ranch to Julio but dies before he can update his will so the property is divided between the daughters who sell it and move to their husbands' homelands.  When World War I breaks out this leaves the grandsons of Madariaga on opposing sides.  It's a very powerful film that stands up superbly after 95 years.  And nobody compares to Valentino when it comes to the tango.",1476835200,4,1350,4.6455696202531644
8109150,5,B000EGDCGO,"The heartthrob, the beauty and the pioneer of cinema. One can not actually call themselves a lover of cinema, a nerd of movies, unless they have seen or fallen in ultimate passion and love of the mastery of Rudolph Valentino. This is a wonderful documentary on his ultimate history. He was the very reality called performer. He was a master at so many films. I think this documentary is pivotal piece of cinema history and should be experienced by any lover of his, or any lover of cinema period. I am one of the hugest, lovers of his talent and I become breathless at his persona in film. He died way to soon and we lost such wonderment in him. I can only think what could have been. Thankfully we have many of his films to look back on. This is a wonderful informational and historical expose of this amazing man and his history. The special features by themselves is enough to make you or should buy it. As a special feature you get one of his amazing films Four Horses of the Apocalypse. Great product and great price.",1427673600,3,1022,4.412698412698413
8109151,5,B000EGDCGO,Splendid documentary (plus The 4 Horsemen of The Apocalypse)!,1421798400,,61,5.888888888888889
8109152,5,B000EGDCGO,"Rudolph Valentino was the heart throb of his time, and to some, he still beats out most current stars.  His performance in ""Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse""  is nuanced and beautiful.  This was a great actor as well as a decent man, who wanted nothing more than, ""A wife, not in movies, who will greet me with my children when I come home.""  Too sad that he never got that.",1419120000,2,373,4.285714285714286
8109153,4,B000EGDCGO,"Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse is one of the finer silent films ever made, and the most popular movie until Gone with the Wind came along and I recently found out that it has been fully restored with lost footage! How great, but it's not out yet. This contains a rather worn copy but the biography that comes too is very good, so I can recommend this collection. Being a movie buff I didn't really know Valentino until the past few years when I've watched almost everything available, he's great, and I'm a straight man who appreciates talent and charm.",1390867200,5,554,4.55
8109154,5,B000EGDCGO,"I really enjoyed the documentary about his life before and after he became a well know actor. The narrator was very knowledgeable about his life and made it very interesting. The song that is playing during the documentary is the original version of the song sang by Rudolph Valentino but the one in the extra features is not his voice unless the recording was clean up to remove the background sound.

The movie ""The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse"" is a very good movie and shows the talent this man had. I have read many reviews of his other movies before this one and after this one and every reviewer have said the same thing that he was a very talented actor with a great sense of humor and he should have done more comedys to show his comedic talent.

There have been other reviews that have said that because of his Italian accent it would't have been able to work in the talking movies, I would rather take the confirmation from Gloria Swanson who worked with him and who said that he had a very nice accent, not pronounced and that he would have been able to do the transition from silent to talking movies. He probably would have done the same thing that William Powell and Myrna Loy did have huge success sound movies.

Anyway I would recommend this DVD to any one that want to know more about Rudolph Valentino and see the movie that propulses him to fame and fortune.

His death was a great loss for the movie world, none of the other actor that followed after his death couldn't achieve the kind exposure that he achieved when he was alive.

Enjoy this wonderful documentary and movie and see why the women adored him when he was alive and why men hated him and were jealous of him.",1379289600,3,1697,4.4089456869009584
8109155,5,B000EGDCGO,"This film is very well done and is of excellent quality considering how old the film was that most of it was made from. It contains interesting information from fans and historians as well as many scenes from movies that most of us will never see.  The fact that it contains one of his movies on the other side of the disc is an added bonus. I'm looking forward to viewing ""The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse"" since I've seen bits of it in the biography.  And, I've ordered ""The Sheik"" and it's companion piece ""Son of the Sheik"" as I've never seen these and, after all, it was ""The Sheik"" that made him a phenomenon. This film is not only a very interesting look at the man, his life and his movies but at a period of time that is long past now when an actor could so affect a nation that to this day a great lover is often called a ""Valentino"".  I enjoyed this film very much.",1352851200,2,879,4.158823529411765
8109156,5,B000EGDCGO,"I purchased this movie and biography last summer, and loved it!  I have watched it many times.  The biography was very interesting.  If the Academy Awards had been around in the early 1920's, I think this movie would have won an award, and deservedly so.  Thank you Amazon!",1341360000,,273,4.625
