8733557,3,B015GUW3RQ,Not one of the better scenic videos.  This DVD does not loop like other DVDs do.  I buy these videos to play in our lobby. This one only lasts 72 minutes then needs to be restarted.,1507507200,,181,4.0

8733559,5,B015GUW3RQ,"Finally! I've been a subscriber to the Scenery Station podcasts for years and I've always wanted longer shots of each scene. Now here they are and it's just what the doctor ordered. The scenes are quite long - 12 minutes each - so you can really relax into it and zone out. But the best thing is that each scene is so different. You start with a magnificent pine forest on a sunny day and before it's over you've visited a frozen winter landscape with a rushing river, some wild open plains with mountains in the background, a tropical island bay with pitch black rocks and turquoise water, a crazy scene with ocean rock stacks where you can hardly tell where the sea ends and the sky begins before finally ending on a tropical ocean view with fascinating cloud formations. It's a great collection and one that I'll be leaving on in the living room whenever I want a sense of peace and stillness. I'll definitely be checking out their other DVDs!",1451692800,3,946,4.505813953488372
