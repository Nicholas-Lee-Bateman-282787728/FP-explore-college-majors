5008906,3,B006OA2DJ6,"I took the opportunity to watch this during the 2011 SF International Film Festival.  This is a well acted character study about a seriously depressed 20 something who develops a bond with a teenager.
The chemistry between Gerwig and Alexander is credible and the story never strains to push them into a romantic tryst.  I was also impressed by the Delaware setting.  Too many movies want to stick with NYC/LA or other big cities, while ignoring the rest of the country.
I'm looking forward to revisting this one on DVD",1330646400,5,519,4.7444444444444445

For some reason, I was annoyed that she directed most of her anger toward the other woman rather than at her husband.  Not the worst film I've ever seen, but far from the best.",1408579200,2,339,4.25

5008911,5,B006OA2DJ6,"I loved this film. I'm looking forward to more from everyone who created or acted in this film. Greta Gerwig and Olly Alexander were superb
in their roles. The sense of place was also very strong. The location was just an all-American beach town during the off-season in Delaware, but the director got the mood and the light just right. There are moments of grimness and moments of magic. I will watch it again and recommend it to anyone who likes quirky, moody films. Olly Alexander is also musically talented and Greta Gerwig loves to dance. If you like Greta Gerwig in this, see Frances Ha.",1392768000,,593,4.60377358490566

Having seen Greta Gerwig in ""Frances Ha"" I looked up her other films.  I liked this a lot even better than ""Frances"" although I think I liked Greta better in ""Frances.""

I liked this script a lot more.  But what really made it memorable was the performance of Olly Alexander.  He is an awesome young actor with an incredibly expressive, beautiful face. I'll definitely look for him in more films.

One problem I had with the film was the pairing of the two actors, not that they are not both first rate and not that they didn't play well together.  But that the boy looks very young; she looks a good ten years older than he does.  She's also a lot bigger---I bet she weighed at least 40 lbs. more than he did.  And although this is an ""unconventional"" couple of people I found that a little bit of a stretch.  More than that, though, Gerwig's character, Rose, wasn't altogether credible to me.  In the beginning she seems like a ""sorta-crazy but really good-hearted"" type that we've seen in so many Indie films. (Like ""Frances Ha."")  When she lay down on her grave I began to have some doubts about her mental well-being, but when she attacked the yoga teacher in the Grange Hall I really lost my sympathy for her.  Then when she returned to that creepy looking husband I thought that the young guy was a lot better off without her.  True, it's a coming of age experience for him and I hope he goes away older and wiser.

Folks who like quirky, Indie flicks will probably like this a lot.  Others may not.  There's a cross-dressing scene that some might find disconcerting; again, others will love it.  The title is great, reminiscent of the nursery rhyme, ""....and the dish ran away with the spoon.""  This appears in a lovely way at the end of the film.",1386460800,4,1789,4.479876160990712
5008913,2,B006OA2DJ6,This film shouldn't be categorized under comedy.  Don't understand the ethical judgement of bitter wife's anger directed at other woman rather than husband who is the one who has broken the commitment and marriage vows.  Fell asleep during this one.,1385769600,2,249,5.2

5008915,5,B006OA2DJ6,"I loved this film.  I found it so poetic, involved in the pairing  of two unlikely people who in ordinary circumstances would never have been involved in each other.  They are both in pain.  She as the result of an adulterous husband.  He, having traveled all the way from England to meet a girl he met in London who dumped him.  The acting of both Greta Gerwig and Olly Alexander are  gripping...so believable.  (disclosure:  I am the screenwriter/directors Mother)",1346457600,5,466,4.7974683544303796
5008916,4,B006OA2DJ6,"Alison Bagnall brings her 2nd feature length film, The Dish & The Spoon, with shameless intimacy.

After discovering her husband has cheated on her, Rose (Greta Gerwig) goes on a beer-drinking rampage, pulling the young, mysterious vagabond (Olly Alexander) in on her plan for revenge against the bitch who put her in this position.

The two share an undeniable - often cute and occasionally awkward - on screen chemistry.

Their unique and intimate relationship develops in an interesting balance of sexual tension, bare emotions and twisted manipulation.

Bagnall sincerely seems to be an actor's director, where playfulness and experimentation is balanced with an emotional depth.

The film is sincere and reckless, letting the characters lead the narrative. Rose wants to scream, Rose will scream. Rose wants to cuddle, Rose will cuddle. Rose wants to steal, Rose will steal.

The characters really seem free to act how they want and feel in each moment rather than being pulled across a constructed story forcing them to go from point A to B. The characters do what they want, not what they're told. There is something about this movie that reflects real life and relationships in a way that is true and unhindered.

The Dish & The Spoon feels like a secret roller coaster ride that we get to experience with these two strangers as they grope for some sort of emotional connection and personal understanding over a few unlikely days.

It's a brave film that I'm glad I experienced.",1331683200,8,1486,4.987854251012146

8501749,4,B006OA2DJ6,"As modern American tiny-budget indie rom-coms go, this is sweet and charming, managing to avoid falling into most of the mumble-core traps and cliche's. There's something more successfully wistful and sad than usual in this tale of two mismatched and very quirky young people stumbling into each other's lives.

When we meet 20 something Rose, she's literally wailing and crying as she drives her car  seemingly without aim  after discovering her husband has been having an affair. Before long she meets a young, sweetly quiet English boy in his late teens, who came to America to meet up with a girl, and has now been cast adrift by her (maybe  there's a lovely question mark over all this character's stories. While there are scenes that are too precious, and moments where it feels like the film-maker and actors are working a bit too hard and self-consciously at being charmingly weird  moments where you can almost see the actors/director think ""this will be a cool choice"" - there's also a lot of humanity and quiet emotion in the performances by Greta Gerwig and Olly Alexander  creating characters who both seem caught on the edge of real emotional trouble -and in the muted, touching images with which Alison Bagnall frames them.

Yes, maybe we cut to migrating birds one too many times, or we're ahead of the supposed twist of a scene now and then. But it's the moments of fragile human complexity that feel unusual in any American film-making these days, large or small, and which ultimately won this a place in my heart.",1483228800,,1532,4.802281368821292

8501752,4,B006OA2DJ6,"This is what I call a ""slice of life"" movie.  The connection is transitional and has the power to be transcendent.

Gerwig's Rose was in a rage after finding out one of her friends and her husband had an affair.  Her marital relationship was not flashed out.  What we saw in Rose was purely her gut reaction after being betrayed.  She showed emptiness and rage alternatively.  The roller coaster nature was quite real.  Heightened emotion is roller coaster, rising and crashing until the bell curve gets flatter.

Alexander's stranded teen works as a bystander and a pillar for Rose.  Although he's young and just had his heart brokened, he seems light years ahead in emotional steadiness.  These two characters shared a nice contrast.  They had to, because they carried the whole film.

I personally don't feel any sexual nature in their temporary co-dependency.  Rose wasn't attracted to ""the boy"".  ""The boy"" saw Rose with a fascination because she was able to let the volatile nature of being wronged show while he was holding it in.

This is not the movie for everyone.  I personally like it better than Lola Versus, another Gerwig film.  It's meandering but in a good way.  Lola Versus I had to fast forward because I was bored by it.",1451347200,,1240,4.741784037558685
