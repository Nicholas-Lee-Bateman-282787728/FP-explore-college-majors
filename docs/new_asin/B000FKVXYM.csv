8124381,2,B000FKVXYM,"ALL THE SHOWS ARE CUT NOT LESS THAN 15 MINUTES EACH. THIS IS A RIP OFF. WATCH IT ON YOU TUBE THOSE ARE REAL LONG ONES, THIS XENON PICTURES DVD SUCKS!.",1336780800,,150,3.870967741935484
8124382,5,B000FKVXYM,"First caught this show back in the early eighties whilst living in Southern California. Just as - good humour 'appreciating - Americans would leap naked out of the bath to 'catch' Fawlty Towers, so would I, cease, upon any type of 'activity' (to my wife's despair!) in order, not to miss Quico (what an incredibly-talented comedian), Chavo, Donna Florinda (Mexico's 'version' of a young ""Ena Sharples"") Chilindrina, Nono (he was something else), Don Ramon, and, Professor Jirafales. I do not speak one word of Spanish, and, there are no subtitles, but; who cares! I wish somebody would acquire the rights and bring the entire series over to Europe. I owe Amazon.com an immense debt of gratitude.",1217980800,,695,5.0
8124383,2,B000FKVXYM,"This review that I'm making here isn't about this DVD perse, is about the whole set of DVD's from El Chavo del 8 that have been released.
I'm a big fan of this TV program and I was thrilled when I saw some years ago that some DVD's were edited. I got 3 or 4 and after watching them I was dissapointed because the episodes were cut and the image was poor.
Now some years later I have all the DVD's and some are good but they're far from giving any quality. Another thing that bothers me, is that the backing music is different. It's more modern but far from being good. Nothing compared with the classic music that used to accompany every episode. To continue with the complains, another issue is that sometimes the episodes are repeated  and they don't mention on the DVD case the episodes that features.
Anyway, I think that they should release a set of every season including an enhanced image and sound which is really, really bad...oh, I also wish they release that episode when they went to Acapulco.
With my review I'm only wanting to warn about the changes and the cut episodes but I must also say that if you're a Chavo fan, you're going to have fun eventually.",1183593600,9,1169,4.387096774193548
8124384,5,B000FKVXYM,"Gracias a esta nueva tecnologa (DVD) podemos tener en nuestras manos, prcticamente para siempre, aquellos programas que nos hicieron rer tanto de pequeos. Recomiendo esta edicin de ""La Fiesta"" en especial por el captulo ""El Chavo zapatero, Don Ramn peluquero"" que no haba sido editado en versiones anteriores y que es uno de los episodios clsicos de esta serie tan querida y tan de moda despus de ms de 30 aos. Sin duda es un gusto contar como parte de la coleccin de cada uno de nosotros este nuevo volumen que nos hace rer por medio de comedia ""blanca"", en donde se demuestra que para rer no se necesita hablar de sexo en afn agresivo, ofensas hacia grupos especficos, etc.

Sin duda Roberto Gomez Bolaos puede considerarse a s mismo eterno, pues nunca morir en nuestros corazones con estos personajes que estuvieron con nosotros desde que usabamos paales.

Capitulos: 1. La fiesta. 2. La chirimoya. 3. El sueo del Chavo. 4. El Chavo zapatero, Don Ramn peluquero. El dvd cuenta con 2 Sketches adicionales: ""El Chavo durmiente"" y ""Crema de rasurar"". La unica opcion de audio disponible es Espaol, no tiene subtitulos.

Le doy 5 estrellas, si les gusta el Chavo y estn pensando en comprarlo este es mi consejo: COMPRENLO QUE NO SE ARREPENTIRAN.",1178409600,5,1244,4.776744186046511
