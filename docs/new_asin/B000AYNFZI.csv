8080999,5,B000AYNFZI,The movie is still as delightful as I remember when it first came out.  It is informative and really makes you aware of the blight of animals in captivity.  Thank goodness we now have places like Sea World that take care of these amazing animals.  I look forward to sharing this one with my grandchildren ages 3 & 6.,1189123200,2,316,4.322033898305085
