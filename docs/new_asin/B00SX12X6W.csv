6994155,5,B00SX12X6W,"If you are already a Garth lover, you will need this for your collection of unforgettable DVD's. If your new to Garth, the interviews will make you fall in love with him as a person, a father, and professional. If you're looking for a concert DVD this is NOT the product for you, no music just 72 minutes of small scale interviews up close and personal with Garth.",1428019200,10,364,4.367647058823529

8699639,5,B00SX12X6W,"...really great guy. It's amazing to see how fame and money hasn't changed him and how he's stayed down to earth. As others have said, no music in this set - but what does that matter? I have my CDs to hear Garth sing, I got this to hear Garth talk.",1432684800,2,249,3.9019607843137254
8699640,5,B00SX12X6W,"Great DVD featuring Garth in conversation from across the years (including discussion of his most recent album Man Against Machine), this is one for the real fans! It's always a pleasure to hear Garth talking about his career - a noble, honest musician, if ever there was one...",1432512000,2,278,4.8125
