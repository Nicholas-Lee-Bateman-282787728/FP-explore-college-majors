7953986,3,B00005U144,"...the vid. quality i have on this dvd is exceptional depending on the manufacturer; i don't remember which i have cuz now im using the usual library pc where the dvd is @ home. im doing this review (sent to me w/o notice from amazon)to get it out of the way now.
this movie does need more monster action. it's still one of the best Mexican creature type movies out there but as usual from Them, this still lax some more action & more intelligence-its kinda aggravating. its gotten old always seeing abel salazar in these type films from ""may he co"". (thats mexico.)
the ""monster"" scenes i remember are: malnurished boxer like attack dogs, a lg. bat, a sm. regular bat, the creature like locked up/beaten x husband, hunchback like ladys aid & human silhouettes, black eyes, more eyes in special f/x, where the crumbling castle scene @ the end was the best action. the story: kinda hard to follow cuz it was hard to get into-you'll just have to see that ""fo yo self"".",1312934400,,966,4.494318181818182
