8606042,5,B00EJJGDMM,"Sorry, but I am a Tracie fan.  She is a professional and not a gimmick person. Tracie knows what muscle group she is using and explains that along the way.  She explains proper form and breathe.  Excellent ques.  If you are going to work out right and not just want to follow ""people"" per say, I would go with Tracie.",1474848000,,317,4.233333333333333
8606043,5,B00EJJGDMM,It is a short and efficient workout. Very effective.,1473984000,,52,4.888888888888889
8606044,5,B00EJJGDMM,"I love this workout, just as I do all of Tracie's workouts. The Focus series consists of short workouts, and other reviewers are right on: no real warm-up and not for beginners. I usually pair with a run or another video. This workout is mostly lower body with some light and fast arm work. Tracie and I are the same age, and I do appreciate that her videos are still tough but also tailored for us middle-aged gals.

Beginners might want to try some of her old vids from her days with The Firm, such as her Tortoise and Hare workouts. She's a great instructor, and her workouts will change your body.",1450656000,5,601,4.366071428571429
8606045,2,B00EJJGDMM,"I just bought this video and I am disappointed. I would not recommend this video to beginner exercisers. There is no warm up at all. The very first move Tracie does incorporates weights. Also, there is a move called ""draw your sword"", and Tracie says use 5-10 pounds. If you have shoulder and rotator cuff issues, even 5-10 pounds is too much weight for this move.
I will continue to use this video because I can't return it. Maybe I will like it better once I know the moves better. But, I will warm up on my own first before pushing ""play"". If anyone is familiar with THE FIRM videos where Tracie started, this is not as careful as her FIRM workouts. Tracie looks more lean and muscular. But, do this video without weight or very light weight at first while you learn the moves (and figure out what a ""safe"" size weight is for your fitness level) and proceed with caution.",1442880000,5,874,4.401234567901234
