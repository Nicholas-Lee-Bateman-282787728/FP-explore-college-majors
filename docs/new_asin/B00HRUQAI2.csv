6201027,5,B00HRUQAI2,"""Mad About Men"" is truly an underrated gem.  It is a whimsical British romantic comedy, sure to win the hearts of anyone who sees it.  Glynis Johns (best known for her role as the mother in ""Mary Poppins"") shines as Miranda, the flirty mermaid who combines sweetness with seduction.  I had no idea that Glynis Johns was so gorgeous in her youth...she could give Marilyn Monroe a run for her money!  With her long golden hair, soft voice, figure ""8"" curves, and doe-eyed beauty, she is truly a delight on screen.  I know that the late actress Diana Dors was considered the British equivalent of Marilyn, but that title should be reserved for Glynis, who had a far more delicate beauty.  Her acting is superbly effortless in ""Mad About Men"" and I love her clothes in this film.  She is somewhat risque by the standards of old Hollywood, yet she does it with such innocence and charm that viewers will fall under her spell.  Check out this cute little movie...you won't be disappointed!",1369353600,20,983,4.641618497109826

It's a sequel  to Miranda...a gorgeous mermaid, who decides to help her land locked family member...also played by Glynis Johns...by enchanting men to fall in love with her cousin....who's taken a vacation from her teaching position.

6201045,2,B00HRUQAI2,"I usually enjoy vintage films.  Tis one was disappointing.  The characters were silly and contrived, and the plot just too goofy.  Glynnis Johns plays two characters and the mermaid kind of takes over the choices of the other to what she considers better choices.  Oh dear.",1440979200,,273,4.869565217391305

6201072,3,B00HRUQAI2,A mermaid comes on land and pretends to be her look a like cousin. She flirts with all the men in town in an attempt to find a better suitor for her two - legged cousin. She disguises her tail with long gowns and gets the men to carry her around; under the pretense that she had an accident. Cute fairy tail LOL.,1428019200,,312,3.9682539682539684

6201094,4,B00HRUQAI2,You have to see the movie Miranda first! You will understand it so much better. I love that this is color. There are two mermaids and one is kind of annoying but she is funny at time. If you love mermaids you have to see this!,1401840000,4,226,3.9347826086956523
6201095,4,B00HRUQAI2,"It's an old movie. But clean, cute, nostalgic for those of us not in the teen groove; a little lame in the realistic category, but who doesn't like mermaids!",1401753600,,157,4.448275862068965
6201096,3,B00HRUQAI2,"If you enjoyed VCI's release of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miranda/dp/B004ZMBKOE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miranda</a>, you'll probably want to catch this belated sequel, filmed in color and released some 6 years later.  Glynis Johns is back as the beguiling and playful mermaid Miranda, with Margaret Rutherford encoring as her nurse.  We also get to meet another mermaid, the simple (and to this viewer, somewhat irritating) Berengaria, played by Dora Bryan.  The catch this time is that Miranda meets her lookalike distant cousin Caroline (Johns in a dual role), and the two agree to switch places for two weeks.  While Caroline is off on vacation, Miranda determines to find a husband for her cousin.

While there are some mildly amusing escapades, the premise is just a bit too silly and lightweight when compared to the more sophisticated original film.  And aside from Johns and Rutherford, the cast is rather dull.  On the plus side, the color palette is very rich; it's a beautiful film to look at.  Anyone who only knows Glynis Johns as the mother in ""Mary Poppins"" is in for a revelation; even nearly 60 years later, she remains the screen's sexiest mermaid.

VCI offers up this somewhat rare film in a nice, if unspectacular print.  Some of the colors are a bit saturated, but the same could be said for many color films from the same period.  I did notice that Miranda's hair color sometimes seemed to change from blonde to light gray within the same scene; but that's probably a fault of the original film elements.  The 2.0 audio served its purpose--this was never intended as a film to demonstrate the capabilities of a high-end sound system.

Bottom line: If you liked ""Miranda,"" you'll probably enjoy ""Mad About Men"". . .just not quite as much.",1397001600,4,1811,5.160958904109589
6201097,5,B00HRUQAI2,"Glynis Johns is beautiful, clever, and witty as the mermaid ""Miranda.""  She switches places with her look-a-like cousin and charms all the men she comes in contact with, in order to find a better fiance for her cousin.  The story is told very clearly, the filming is creative and the plot is interesting.  Glynis (as Miranda) showcases her sweet singing voice with great expression and dramatic pauses at the right spots.  She looks amazing in all her beautiful outfits (extra long to hide her tail!).  Margaret Rutherford is a hoot as the old nurse who helps Miranda get around in a wheelchair.",1391126400,2,595,4.794117647058823
6201098,4,B00HRUQAI2,"A sequel to the unexpected smash hit ""Miranda"" (1948), 1954's ""Mad About Men"" reunites us with Glynis Johns as Miranda Trewella, the beautiful mermaid with an insatiable appetite for fun... and romance.  There is an additional twist this time around, however, with Ms Johns taking on a second role - Miranda's distant relation, Caroline Trewella.

When Caroline inherits an old house perched on the windswept Cornish coast, she meets Miranda, a long-lost relative from the 'underwater branch' of the Trewella clan.  Desperate for some more exciting adventures on dry land, Miranda concocts a plan to assume Caroline's identity for several weeks.  This suits Caroline to a tee, who heads off on a biking holiday.  Nurse Carey (Margaret Rutherford) is brought back into service to assist as the 'invalid' Miranda causes mayhem and confusion for some of her wildest hijinks yet.

""Mad About Men"", filmed in full glorious colour, is arguably even more enjoyable than the original ""Miranda"".  Johns playing not only Miranda but also a look-alike cousin adds an extra dash of fun to the film.  Ms Johns even gets to sing!  Margaret Rutherford, again, is a delight as the nurse and has some great scenes with Dora Bryan, who plays Miranda's fellow mermaid friend Berengaria, a somewhat slow-witted soul who takes a fancy to wearing human clothes.  The cast also includes Donald Sinden, Anne Crawford, Peter Martyn and Nicholas Phipps.  I would have loved to have seen the Miranda story continue in at least one more film - just like the first story, things end on a rather bittersweet note for the fishy heroine - but ""Mad About Men"" is a delight just the same.",1390780800,5,1654,4.956521739130435
6201099,3,B00HRUQAI2,"This was a cute film about the mermaid, Miranda, and her distant human cousin, Caroline.  The antics of Miranda in her attempts at finding a suitable husband for her cousin are amusing and we get to meet a new mermaid (her name escapes me), who is a companion of Miranda's.  Margaret Rutherford returns to nurse Miranda.  This is not quite as good as the first film but I recommend it to any mermaid enthusiasts.",1388707200,2,412,4.54054054054054
8634963,3,B00HRUQAI2,"Mad About Men is sort of a sequel to Miranda, with the role of the mermaid played in both cases by very sexy Glynis Johns and Margaret Rutherford as her nurse--the source of much of the levity in both movies. In this sequel, Johns plays two roles, one of a mermaid and the other of her look-alike distant two-legged cousin. High level silliness is to be expected by the fishy foundations of the movies. But presently, perhaps the storyline went truly overboard, with an unlikeable fianc, two new suitors, two seals, and a second, rather annoying mermaid. The end product is still enjoyable, but perhaps a notch below the Miranda original.",1471824000,2,638,4.756756756756757

I was amazed by how promiscuous the lead female was, as well as how accepting all parties were to her kissing and lack of chaperone.  That and the one fiancee living with her intended.  That was until I found out it wasn't an American movie.  Either way, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was light hearted and fun.  And one I'll watch again in future.",1458864000,2,402,4.364864864864865
