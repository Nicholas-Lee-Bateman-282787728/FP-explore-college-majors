8089179,4,B000BMYRTM,"I bought this video hoping to see lots of goals from Hugo Sanchez's career and this DVD has just that. The video is extensive, and at times there's too much commentary, but you get to see the best Mexican footballer in action throughout his whole career (with Pumas, Atltico de Madrid & Real Madrid, even some footage with the Mexican National Team) and narrating his trajectory.

You get to see tons of goals, and plenty of fantastic ones. I was amazed by so many spectacular goals scored in every conceivable way, from every conceivable angle. He has lots and lots of great goals, not just a handful.

The video quality is not very good (thus the 4 star rating) and the production looks old, but I expected this because of the footage being old. Still, the image gets better progressively as the ""years go by"" during the film.

For anyone who wants to know why Hugo was and is the best Mexican player ever, this video is a great purchase, and I guarantee you'll be in awe of this truly gifted athlete.",1317081600,2,1003,4.5
