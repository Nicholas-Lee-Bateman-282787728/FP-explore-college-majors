For skeptics that were not sure of what this movie would turn out to be, this movie is absolutely wondeful!  This mind boggling drama full of twist and turns is a great tool to show just how good Mariah Carey can act.  You can be sure that you will be surprised how good this movie is.  Watch it, and enjoy it because I know I did.",1035072000,,352,4.072463768115942

mariahs latest movie
Firstly, we're introduced to Meg (Mira Sorvino) who is making her move to Statten Island in New York after her past has forced her to go beyond and away from her home in St Louis, Missouri. Though we don't yet know Meg's story, it's obvious that whatever reason she's moving to New York, it is not a happy one.
Moving in with her grandmother until she finds work, Meg soon enough finds herelf waitressing in the upper class Le Santilino's - an Italian restaurant where Meg finds true friends in the form of fellow waitresses Kate (Melore Walters) and Raychel (Mariah Carey). Friends are not the only unexpected people Meg stumbles across while working in the restaurant. She soon realises that the restaurant is more or less a front to cover up the drug dealings and murders that occur within.
Before she can turn to run, Meg is swallowed immediately into the underground world and through her medical training, is seen by the bosses as a valuable asset - if she can keep her mouth shut. Meg tries to understand exactly what Santilino's is all about from Raychel but, the tart with heart just blows it off as usual business. As long as the money is good, ""it makes up for all the times I get stiffed,"" explains Raychel.
Waitressing in the restaurant for ten years, Raychel is a solid part of the so-called, 'family'. A tough talking New Yorker who does what she can to get by - even if it means confronting one of the regular customers, and mobsters, in a display of power where she comes out on top. It would be easy at first to blow Mariah's character off but, her portrayal of Raychel packs enough credibility to make you care enough for her just as much as she does for her pals, Meg and Kate, - especially by the end of the movie
Kate, at first, comes off as vulnerable and shy - cute - but, as we later find out, there's a secret she's been keeping that will place the friendship of these three women in danger of falling apart forever.
The climax of the movie seemed to roll by a little too quickly but, overall, Wise Girls played out well. There were really no uneccessary scenes that dragged along. Fast paced, we learned the story of all three women, we witness their friendships grow enough to feel for each of them and, with a few twists thrown in for good measure, we're treated to a movie that is memorable and entertaining.",1034467200,20,2506,4.471615720524017

She is in obvious emotional pain and the viewer wants to know what is behind it.  She is sympathetic and likeable.  There is plenty of action and no boring scenes.  As other Reviewers have stated, there is a real twist that will floor you.  I am happy to learn that this was money well spent for a very entertaining movie.",1473120000,,490,4.388888888888889

1798708,5,B0000714DU,"I loved Mira Sorvino and Mariah Carey so much in this movie and the bond between the 3 waitresses, that I'm buying it because I know that I will watch it over and over again  through the years. I liked the plot and the supporting cast is really good! The price is right too!

One thing, though. There is *some* violence that can be a little hard to take. One scene, really leaves it all to your imagination but since I have such a good imagination [grin] it really bothered me. The other scene that I remember that was hard to take was when someone was being kicked in the face.
If you can get past that, it's well worth buying IMO (In my opinion.)

1798806,4,B0000714DU,"I like Mira Sorvino quite a bit, so I had to check this movie out after her excellent work in Human Trafficking.  I passed it up a few times because I'm not a fan of Mariah ""Screaming Mimi"" Carey, but gave in and enjoyed the movie a lot.  Meg (Sorvino)is an honest former med student who's come to stay with her grandmother after her boyfriend is killed in a car accident and, looking for a job, ends up waitressing at a restaurant that caters largely to the mob.  She quickly befriends two other waitresses, wise cracking Raychel (Carey) and an aspiring actress wannabe, Kate (Melora Walters).  The girls bond and make a lot of money, enabling Meg to move into her own apartment and help her grandmother out.  Unfortunately, wherever the mob convenes trouble isn't far behind, and Meg finds herself in all kinds of hot water after getting into an argument with one of the regulars.

Fast paced, with twists and turns you don't see coming, this is a good mobster/chick flick with enough grit to keep men interested and enough female bonding to hold women's interest.  Check it out for yourself and see what you think.  And I will be honest:  Mariah wasn't half bad either.",1339632000,,1172,4.596153846153846

I have to say that Mariah did a very good job in this movie.  Maybe the writing had alot to do with that.  This movie starts out kind of chick flickish but then takes a dramatic turn to a mob movie.  It really works and I love it.  Mira Sorvino did an excellent job here.  Malora Walters played a very important role in this movie.,1173052800,,459,4.206896551724138
1798837,3,B0000714DU,"Meg (Mira Sorvino) came to stay with her grandma, in a broken spirit. She found a waitress job in a high end Italian mob controlled restaurant. Originally distracted and detached, Meg soon found comfort in the company of the other two waitresses - the ambitious and sophisticated Raychel (Mariah Carey) and Kate (Melora Walters) who aspired to be an actress. As her skills brought her to the spotlight, allowing her to move closer to the power circle, she even began to enjoy the generous tips and the new respect accorded her. With power came confidence and one thing led to another. This was, afterall, a mob restaurant and a brutal murder was imminent.

Mira Sorvino exuded sadness through her large eyes and a quiet beauty, enticing the audience to know more about her mysterious past. As Raychel described Meg a person difficult to figure out - she was shy but could be forthcoming, clumsy but competent at critical moments. Being a Harvard graduate, majoring in Chinese, Mira Sorvino was perfect in portraying Meg, an intellectual with solid credentials. At first Meg was defiant and sad, then content and sweet, then desperate and angry. And Mira portrayed these emotional transformations fluidly just as she moved elegantly from table to table, shielding herself with a winning but cautious smile. Mariah Carey looked radiant and delivered a creditable performance as Raychel.

The story took a fast U turn near the end, Meg was cornered and limited in options. Kate became the crucial element. The last 10 minutes was gripping, especially with Mira Sorvino fighting back her tears and fear. As the second to last scene blacked out, I feared it was no more and the story would be left incomplete and pointless. Fortunately, it was saved by the last scene and with it sprang a glimmer of hope. For Mira Sorvino, surprising plot twists and a mix of friendships and action, this movie is worth watching. Wise girls survived as they stood by one another from beginning to end.",1154649600,6,1980,4.8898809523809526

As for the plot, i was very taken by how you feel for the characters from the very beginning. The music flows great with the movie, nothing too outrageous but somewhat modern folk and yet very moving. The acting was good, the characters were very well defined seperately from eachother.

The best part of the movie was the plot twist. Somewhat predictalble in a mob movie but this one took a morbid sort of turn.

My first time watching the movie i was laughing at some subtle jokes, and then biting my nails to the point that i was so nervous for the characters that i had to get up and walk around.

The second twist at the end of the movie really had me in tears.

I honestly love watching movies and was not expecting this from this movie as i do not remember when it came out, but any movie that can have me laughing, on the edge of my seat and crying, gets a 5 star rating in my book.

Was very enjoyable to watch because some of the characters are not well known as ""actors"" and I was NOT embarrassed for any actor in the film.

The story is about a medical student, Meg (Sorvino), moving back to her home in New York after her fiance dies in a car accident.  She lives with her grandmother and gets a job at local restaurant waiting tables.  She works extremely hard and is a little thrown back by how strict and seriously everyone is taking their job.  Meg meets some new friends on the job aswell.  Kate (Walters), plays a wannabe actress who is a temp worker at the restaurant, and Raychel (Carey), who is a long time worker at the restaurant that is hoping for a managing promotion soon. They start hanging out and become great friends.  Most of the regulars in the restaurant are big-wig italian gangsters with only one thing on their mind, drug deals.  Meg is easily making hundreds of dollars a night on tips and one night after work, she gets into an argument and is defended by one of her clients.  It results in a murder, and having witnessed it, she is now sucked into the the mob, and if she tells anyone, her life is on the line.  Sorvino is awesome! Carey kicks ass!  and Walters is a delight.

1798885,2,B0000714DU,"... very bad, impossible ending with one bloody scene.  I don't say Miriah Carey is in the same league with some Hollywood leading ladies, but at least her acting is not bad as you may think, far better than her in ""Glitter.""  The problem lies elsewhere; the film's story.
Actually, ""Wisegirls"" starts pretty well, about the medical student Meg (Mira Sorvino) coming back to her home in Staten Island, New York.  She starts to work as food server at a local restaurant where she meets two other workers, Raychel (Carey) and Kate (Melora Walters).  Meg soon finds out that this Italian restaurant is 'connected,' and some customers look like coming from ""The Sopranos,"" but anyway she does the hard works better than the owner of the shop at first estimated, and Raychel and Kate are always there to be helpful.
Then the story of the friendship between three girls start.  The scenes of the restaurant in which they work are the best part of the film, with its very convincing production design.  In spite of the unique location of the Staten Island, the film spends most of its time in indoor scenes, and the decision is justified by the impressive work from the designer.
But the film suffers from cliched moments.  You see, Meg has something to confess, and when Mira Sorvino does it, it's an amateur hour with the uninspired lines for her to say.  Not that Mira Sorvino is bad, remember it.  But the simple fact is, no one can save the awfully melodramatic, uninteresting monologue from utter boredom (but I still believe Mira Sorvino  truly needs revamping of her career).
More damaging thing is, however, the plot twist at the second half of the story.  The feel-good story about these girls' friendship is turned into something totally different, utterly unnecessary and forced beyond belief, which includes a murder and some cheap and disgusting gore from B-gangstar film.  And even that part is not free from cliche.
As I said, Ms. Carey is not bad.  Well, if you like her, you won't give the film with her name a bad review anyway, but if her acting had been as good as this in her first feature film, she might have escaped the harsh critical attacks on her she suffered in ""Glitter.""
But as you can easily imagine, the most impresive actor is Melora Walters, who changes her tone as the film goes on.  She might be wasting her talent, as in other films of her in the past, but the fact remains that she could be the reason for you to see the film, no matter how bad it could be.  And here, unfortunately, she is following the same pattern again.",1089158400,9,2556,4.6114790286975715
1798886,5,B0000714DU,"This is one of those simple movies with subtle depth. I missed WiseGirls when it came out and just caught it on HBO. Mira Sorvino was wonderful, as always, and, I'm embarrassed to say, I didn't recognize Mariah Carey so I was able to enjoy her solid performance without getting distracted by the baggage of her ""persona."" It's clean, moving, intelligent and thought-provoking. There's a bit of ""Hollywood"" in it, but so what?

1798933,2,B0000714DU,"Nearly every distributor in the business understandably passed on this straight-to-video stinker, not wanting to enable Mira Sorvino in gleefully cramming her flailing career in the Cuisenart.
Fans of Mariah ""Meltdown"" Carey may be tempted to rent this in hope gaining some insight into the rumored-about, salt shaker-tossing catfight that erupted between her and Sorvino when the diva showed up late on the set for the umpteenth time.  Watching this pastafoozeling silliness, you'll marvel at the fact that she showed up at all.
It's clear early on that no one involved in this opus knew what kind movie they were making.  What starts out as a marinara-flavored 9 to 5 inevitably spirals into a Girl Power Good Fellas.  (Forgive the tacky, Italian clichs but these here filmmakers already beat me to the punch.)
Wisegirls, an undercooked narrative lasagna, tells us the story of three waitresses:  the surly, confident workhorse (Carey), the struggling, flibbertigibbet actress (Melora Walters), and the sensitive newcomer (Sorvino) who harbors a Terrible Secret and is looking for a Clean Start.  They slave away in an upscale, ""Family"" eatery for exorbitant tips doled out by lecherous goombahs.
The unintentional laughs begin when a coked-out, thug hanger-on blows his nose off with his own pistol.  (Anything to get out of this movie.)  Sorvino stops the movie dead, announcing, ""Back off!  I went to medical school!""  Just when you think it can't get any loopier, Sorvino saves the day by wrapping the guy's head in cellophane!  You won't want to miss the sight of Carey squirming while having to prop open the goon's bloody nostrils with her fingers.
Naturally, the ladies bond after enjoying some working-girls-out-on-the-town antics.  During one particular girlie rap session, Carey sips champagne with her pinky finger up and goads Sorvino's Terrible Secret out of her.  I wouldn't dream of spoiling it for you but I do have to let one thing slip: you'll never look at carnival rides the same way again.
Try to stay awake to see hapless Sorvino finally Run Afoul Of The Mob.  Our heroine is clocked after mouthing off to her drunken boss and one of her Guido admirers comes rushing to her defense, beating the jerk into a bloody manicotti.  Now that she's Seen Too Much, Sorvino is forced to use her well-learned surgical skills on the disposing of the evidence.  Held at gunpoint, she contemplates taking a bullet or gettin' busy with the hacksaw while she acts and acts and acts!
Stay tuned for another ridiculous surprise involving Walters' character (It makes her heretofore birdbrained performance somewhat forgivable) but I can't resist spoiling the biggest surprise of all: MARIAH CAREY IS THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE.  I'm still not sure why this is.  Perhaps it's because she doesn't try as hard and simply coasts through the wreckage on her starpower while Sorvino and Walters are embarrassingly methody, toiling away as if they're making serious art.
So open a bottle of cheap Chianti, bask in the sleazy glow of this made-by-coke-money bonfire, and be prepared to hate yourself in the morning.  Don't say I didn't warn you.",1056585600,6,3149,5.058027079303675

I just hope she would do well in this and she did, but I think Mira Sorvino really makes the movie go along. This is a great Mob movie! You just have to check it out!

This film is well acted and has an interesting stroyline that is gripping but at the same time fun. To go into storyline details may give too much away about the film, but I will say that the buzz is well deserved and it is a film worth watching and the storyline does not get boring nor is there a dull moment in the film when you wished the action would speed up. The most interesting thing about the movie is the excellent performance by Mariah Carey as Rachel. If Mariah gives more performances like this one then I will certainly be standing in line to buy a ticket to see any film she appears in. Miro Sorvino should also be singled out for praise.

1798939,1,B0000714DU,"Alright, all you Mariah fans have weighed in with your four and five star reviews.  Now it's time for a regular movie viewer to comment.  This film is complete dreck!
Mira Sorvino must have blown through her cash or owed a friend a favor because this film will certainly not justify her Oscar status.  She is as bland and bored as can be throughout this.  In her defense, the average viewer feels the same way.  In the first 2/3 of this movie, nothing happens.  Really, nothing happens.
Mira, Mariah and Melora (try saying that three times fast) play three waitress in a mob restaurant who just babble at each other.  They talk about drunk driving, saving baby squirrels, lost dads and the Charleston(yup).  Mariah -- who appears to be wearing her own too-small clothes -- incessantly flaps and waves her arms in the air like some giant kinky-haired bird. Scary.  Melora has the unfortunate task of making the most ridiculous character seem believable.  She fails.  The last 1/3 of the film does have some action, but it is some of the most ridiculous, implausable stuff you will EVER see.
There is a reason it did not get released to the theaters - all involved would probably sue after their carreers were totally destroyed.  This movie is so bad it's, well it's just so bad.",1046044800,4,1277,4.651785714285714
1798940,4,B0000714DU,"What an absolute delight of a movie ! I cannot tell you just how much this movie meant to me as a journalist that has to sit through some cinematic garbage week in, week out ! But, 'Wisegirls' was definitely not part of that pile as from moment number one it came out of the blocks with its head held high and never once let it drop. This could even be one of the best movies of 2002 and it is a killer shame that it never made it to the big screen theatres. (Although, my bet is that having finally seen the bad press for Carey's first movie attempt - `Glitter' - subside enough to launch her sophomore attempt here, they were still not confident enough to hit the mainstream American audiences full on !) But, and with that in mind - let alone her ""performance"" in the aforementioned 'Glitter', Carey is actually very reasonable here ... Of course she has her `over-acting' moments, but the rest of the highly-delightful cast rally round her at all times and stop her from falling flat on her face .... again ! Sorvino is just wonderful in her role as the nave small-town waitress entered upon the world of the Underground Mob via the restaurant business, and the ending is just an unexpected sight to behold ! Rent this or buy this and you will not have wasted an hour and a half of your life, but will have been pleasantly entertained. ...",1044403200,5,1343,4.354581673306773

Next to her superb performance in Glitter, which in my opinion is one of the best movies in 2001.  Mira did an excellent job working alongside Carey and Waters.

Mob films don't usually interest me, but this one did. It has twists and turns that keep your attention and strong performances from the the three leading actesses.

New to the movie scene Melora Walters was just perfect nobody could of filled her shoes. The 3 woman get along perfectly in Wisegirls, I myself couldn't have choosen a better cast.
 A DARK and MOODY movie, beware of the Language and Violence (which I enjoyed) but other than that well worth the watch. Fantastic soundtrack too, Taryn's Maake It Go Away just made me weep at the GraceYard scene. :(",1035763200,4,663,4.61864406779661
1798978,5,B0000714DU,"First, let me clear up any confusion about the title and the concept of the movie:  it's a feminine take on the term wiseguy.  Second, this is not a chick flick.  Before actually sitting down to watch the movie, I read some really positive reviews about the movie that praised the cast and their performances--the big shocker being that Mariah's portayal of Raychel garnered the most compliments.  The story itself was well written.  It flowed evenly and like other professional critics have said--the casting was perfect.  The film itself takes place in Staten Island, NY (actually Halifax and Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada).  The plot revolves around our heroine Meghan ""Meg"" Kennedy (Oscar winner Mira Sorvino), a med school drop out who is trying to start her life over after suffering a traumatic loss.  She eventually gets a job at Il Santalino, an upscale Italian eatery, and quickly learns via her new found friends sweet ingenue Kate (Melora Walters, ""Boogie Nights,"" ""Magnolia"") and the graceful but brassy Raychel (Mariah Carey, who does a complete rebound after her disasterous big screen debut in ""Glitter"") that the restaurant is actually a front for a major drug cartel.  Meg grapples with her conflicted feelings of accepting wads of $100 bills from mobsters just for being pretty, while at the same time avoiding the unwanted romantic advances of her boss's sleazy son.  Sooner than you can say ""al dente"" the climax comes about in the form of an undercover cop (I won't tell who it is) who corners Meg and forces her to gather incriminating evidence against the Santalinos and their cociane-sniffing associates.  The film then dissolves into an epilogue that reveals the outcome of three central characters.  You'll want to stick around for the surprise ending.

As for the acting, I thought it was top notch. I must say that I was especially impressed by Ms. Carey's performance.  Having seen ""Glitter"" I was dreading having to be subjected to watching any of the scenes Mariah was in.  She amazingly and surprisingly did very well.  The only complaint I have about her performance, was her Brooklyn accent--it sounded so fake.  One would think she'd be able to pull off a more convincing one, being as she is a born-and-bred Long Islander.  Mira Sorvino did a great job as always.  Not an Oscar-worthy role, but none the less a good one. I thought Melora Walters's character Kate registered weakly at first.  She was shy, funny, even cute.  However, a certain plot device used later on in the film totally explains everything.  The special features on the DVD are quite limited: only the trailer and Spanish and English subtitles are included.  If you like comedy-dramas or are just in the mood for a well-done, perfectly constructed, modestly-budgeted movie, then by all means see ""Wisegirls.""",1035331200,35,2815,4.980728051391863

They are not a part of the mob, but are surrounded by mobsters who run a restaurant and a major drug operation.

The movie is well written, perhaps it was a sleeper and of course there is a lot of language in the film. Mira realizes that she is somewhere where she doesn't want to be. The movie has an unexpected twist at the end.

Also there are a couple of songs in the movie that don't appear until the end and in the end credits. The songs are ""Make It Go Away"" sung by Taryn Murphy and ""Never Say Goodbye"" sung by Lara DeBenedictis. Other songs are good as well. Too bad they never released a soundtrack of the movie.
