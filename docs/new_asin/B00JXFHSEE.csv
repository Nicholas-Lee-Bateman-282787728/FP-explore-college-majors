6396440,2,B00JXFHSEE,"Great actors, silly script, worst soundtrack ever - that alone ruined it.",1409097600,2,73,5.166666666666667
6396441,2,B00JXFHSEE,"It looks like Im already in the minority here but this film just didn't do it for me. I think that at least once in every major actors career they take the easy way out and make a film for the $ or the location. I think back on when Helen Mirren made the film Love Ranch (directed by her husband Taylor Hackford) playing a madam in a Nevada brothel. And the late Robin Williams had some duds too.

I came to this film because of Emma Thompson  who I think is great!  Pierce Brosnan is also well-known though  not being a fan of James Bond films, I didn't come because of him.  Look at the rest of the cast and see if you recognize any names  I think not. Yes, the film has great scenery in Paris and the French Riviera, but that wasn't enough to hold my attention. This is a slapstick romantic comedy with the emphasis on the slapstick. Thompson carries it off but after 30 minutes I was bored. And the plot is a dumb set-up. Brosnan heads the department of  a company  and we are never really told the business they are in  and at the beginning of the film the company finances crash because of economic meltdown.  We see all the employees who lost their jobs and savings and then we never see them again  except for Brosnan and Thompson who are divorced couple. Id probably wrote more about this but  in my opinion  the less time spent the better.

The DVD has two bonuses: First is the Trailer which, in under two minutes, shows you all the highlights (as though there are many. The second is a six-minute interview with Brosnan who rattles off nearly the complete plot outline and  frankly  looks both bored and interested in doing something else.

Im afraid I may be in the minority so far but the highlight on the DVD for me was the trailer for another film from Ketchup Entertainment about a soccer team from American Samoa. Now THAT Im looking forward to seeing.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6396443,3,B00JXFHSEE,"English man's company is raided by a French company. He has no pension when he is about to retire. He has no  college money for his kids are in college. He has no mortgage money for his and his ex-wife's houses. So he and his exwife decide to go get it back from French guy.

Umm. This movie was a mildly entertaining TV-like movie. Nothing special. Nothing boring. But not worth movie ticket money. There were some very odd sequences. For example, the woman and man are ready to plunge to their death. They profess their affection for each other. But after they are saved she spends the night with a young french guy. Just kinda odd. Also it is really too far fetched even for an escapist movie to show some young tart giving up millions in jewels, homes, clothes, etc because she doesn't ""like"" a guy. Sorry. If she was that kinda person she wouldn't be there to begin with. Lastly, the little tiny bit of liberal-speak that crept into this movie about large corporations ripping off the little hard working stiff couldn't even get off the ground. They tried to say that they were in France--a socialist country--so they couldn't hate France for this reason. It was a Frenchman who stole their money. Moronic. It was just odd things like this and the lack of chemistry developed between the two main characters that just didn't do it for me for this movie. Dare I say this is an old person's movie. Brosnan looks old. Hey, he is. And at least he is showing his age. Good for him (I guess we have to say that as this is a movie and these are movie stars). But that doesn't mean I want to see him in a romantic movie. I just remember him as the uber skinny hairy chested blue eyed stud of the 70s and 80s. Oh well. We all age. But  that other guy . . . he was such a hottie ginger man. Big burly ginger stud of a man. Now he is gray. Even his beard. Sad. I guess that is it. Seeing these beautiful people old and wrinkly is sad. But on a high note. I am desperately sure that that last scene (with the gift) along the Seine is the exact same spot that I can remember in two movies set in France. One movie was where two people got brutally killed. Another is the scene of a girl being sold into sexual slavery. So I am at least glad that if they are going to recycle the spot that it has some positive connotation this time. Sheesh.",1409011200,,2332,4.2242152466367715
6396444,5,B00JXFHSEE,"""I will find out what's going on it will just take time. I will make sure that everyone of you gets what they're due. I will not, will not let you down."" Richard (Brosnan) is finally at the point in life where he is going to retire. He sold his company and has a comfortable pension coming. When he shows up on the last day he is surprised to learn that the company that bought his is under investigation and every asset they had is frozen. When he tells his ex wife Kate (Thompson) they decide to talk to the man that bought the company. When things don't go the way they want they are left with only one choice. I am a big Pierce Brosnan fan and I really like when he plays a take off of James Bond in comedies. He did that in the Matador. This one does have shades of Bond in it as well. Other then that the movie is hilarious. Brosnan and Thompson are perfect together and I laughed pretty much all the way through. I don't want to talk to much about it because to much would ruin it but not only is the dialog witty with some great running jokes but the soundtrack is awesome. Nothing is funnier then watching four 60 year-olds walking in slow motion into a hotel with I Fought The Law playing. This is one I could just go on and on about but all I'll say is watch this...very funny. Overall, a must see comedy. There is British humor but this is also more main stream. I give this an A-.",1408838400,12,1393,4.087591240875913
6396445,4,B00JXFHSEE,"As a caper movie, THE LOVE PUNCH is filled with plot holes.  Indeed, the daring heist that the leading characters attempt to pull off is downright silly, yet the players in this romantic comedy are so charming and their dialogue so smart and funny, that the utter ridiculousness of the escapade becomes unimportant to the enjoyment of this film from writer/director Joel Hopkins.

Pierce Brosnan and Emma Thompson play a divorced couple, who are shocked to discover that their entire pension/retirement plans have been stolen by an unscrupulous French businessman (Laurent Lafitte).  Virtually broke, Pierce and Emma decide, with the help of good friends Timothy Spall and Celia Imrie, to get their revenge against this crook (and reclaim their own money) by stealing a ten million dollar diamond that he has recently purchased as a wedding present for his somewhat reluctant  fiance (Louise Bourgoin).

Brosnan may once have been James Bond, but in this movie he plays an ordinary, middle-aged businessman, and even though, at moments, the films background music evokes memories of .007, this heist is not one that an amateur like Pierces current character and his cohorts could believably pull off.  Its really like an old Mickey Rooney/Judy Garland musical, but instead of Hey, kids, lets put on a show, its lets pull off a heist.

But, don't think about that.  Just sit back.  Enjoy the performances and the dialogue and have some fun.

Ketchup Entertainment distributes THE LOVE PUNCH onto DVD.  The sole extra on the disc is an interview with Brosnan.

6396475,3,B00JXFHSEE,"I really like Thompson & Brosnan but though the scripted constant banter should be engaging, you can't hear or understand it. If American English is the only language you've been brought up with then the Poor sound quality only keeps you further from deciphering Bronsan & Thompson's accents which though delivered well, are garbled. It should be noted that the scripted swearing doesn't seem to fit Bronsan's & Thompson's characters & the discussions with ""too much information"" make for a more uneven, not smooth comedy.

Spoiler:

at the very end  Thompson has sex with a 20 something even though she isn't interested in the ""boy"" &  is obviously attracted to her Ex . Is this casual sex revenge, or ego or ? It's the very thing that she has been criticizing her ex for ! She knows her Ex knows that she has done it. It detracts from her character's likability.

6396480,5,B00JXFHSEE,I adore most of the works of Pierce Brosnan and Emma Thompson equally so to have them together in a picture with fellow English character actors Celia Imrie and Timothy Spall was just a delightful treat!

6396482,5,B00JXFHSEE,"I really like this movie  it's silly, improbable, farcical and poignant in turns, and entirely dedicated to having the viewer enjoy the good time the actors are so obviously having, as they romp through this deliciously engaging souffl of a plot.  Reminiscent of the madcap speeded-up nonsense of Casino Royal, there is a daring jewel heist, a broad swipe at callous corporate takeover mentality and a tender, against-all-odds mature romance.

If you were hoping for conflict or some dark, sinister, violence-filled story line, you're out of luck - and this is not the film for you. But if you enjoy beautiful locations, with beautiful principal protagonists and the skilful and deceptively relaxed way they engage us and bring us on board for the ride ... well, this is a feel good film, that you can watch more than once, and still find the charm in Pierce Brosnan's cheeky delivery and the beguiling attraction in Emma Thompson's cautious response.

They are terrific together and entirely believable in the history and connection they portray. And with their best friends and neighbours, played by Celia Imrie and Timothy Spall, they have to be on their best comedic toes not to have quite a few scenes stolen by those two.

Spall and Imrie are indeed a revelation to me. I knew some of Celia Imrie's work, but not so much Timothy Spall's and he is so genuine in his character, it's almost unnerving. And they're both very, very funny, and likeable in this, and it truly is a quartet piece: they are more than supporting, they are stellar.  In fact, considering that comedy is much more demanding than drama, the quality of acting is uniformly well above average, even down to smaller roles such as the hack-meister son (charmingly played by Jack Wilkinson) and, my favourite, Marisa Berenson as the irresistibly scheming hotelier.  The French actors, Louise Bourgoin and Laurent Lafitte, barely break sweat in their undemanding parts but supply the required Gallic accent with charming competence.

Picture quality is excellent and the UK-issue DVD has two extra features:  interviews with the four main actors (which I found pleasant enough) and audio commentary by the director and co-writer Joel Hopkins, who is candid, interesting and amusing in a very unpretentious way; not always the case with those kinds of commentaries that can easily degenerate into a bore-fest of epic proportions.

I wish there were more fun, fluffy films like this one, of similar quality, and with stars who truly know how to act, because certainly I, for one, can do without the gloom and gore pushed out at us by Hollywood. And a film that has, as its opening scene, a sunny shot of a Martini being shaken for beautiful people in clean clothes  hey, it can't be bad  despite what the critics say.  Probably the total absence of dystopian misery and pointless destruction offends their self-imagined intellectual benchmark. Good, I am so glad it does.

The Love Punch is a really good, fun film performed by good actors, with good direction, a fun script, and with its main intent to give you a good time watching it. What's not to like?",1461024000,,3125,4.893939393939394

6396503,4,B00JXFHSEE,"This is a romantic comedy/caper movie that is completely predictable, totally implausible and still a bit of fun.  Brosnan and Thompson are a divorced couple with enough of a spark left  to leave the audience rooting for a reconciliation.  That reconciliation will come about through mutual need, mutual support and a little fairy dust.

Brosnans London company has been taken over by a sleazebag Frenchman who has promptly wrecked it and drained its pension funds.  That means that neither Brosnan nor Thompson will have much of a future (with or without one another) and neither will Brosnans devoted employees.  Fortunately, the French wheeler-dealer is about to be married on the Cote DAzur and he has purchased a humongous diamond for his wife to wear.  Since weve all seen To Catch A Thief we know what happens to large diamonds on the French Riviera.

Brosnan and Thompson enlist the help of Celia Imre and Timothy Spall (who nearly steals the show).  The four impersonate two over-the-top Texas couples, crash the wedding (after donning wetsuits, swimming great distances and climbing cliffs).  After playing James Bond and company they will all return to their cottages in Weymouth and retire comfortably.  That, at least, is the plan.

The performers are clearly enjoying themselves.  One imagines a casting director calling up the leads and saying, The pays not great and this is not Citizen Kane but well shoot in Paris and then move on to Cannes and other good places.

The always-wonderful Spall plays a man with a past . . . Vietnam . . . the French Foreign Legion . . . probably MI6 . . . .  When he walks through a metal-detecting imaging device all kinds of interesting things show up in his innards.  The rest of the time hes exhausting the British lexicon of familiar titles from my son to old sod.

6396526,3,B00JXFHSEE,"The Love Punch is so forgettable that I had to google movies with Pierce Brosnan to remember the title. While I admire both  Brosnan and Thompson, I'm not sure why they felt this was an appropriate script for them...but then again, he did Mama Mia. I do think that rom-coms for the over 50 set has a place in Hollywood, this one was just too silly. Also, it might have had more relevance during the Enron days, but seemed a bit dated now. I thought the supporting couple who were cast were wonderful, as was the bride. There were some fun moments, and the South of France scenery does wonders for your viewing pleasure, but frankly, I lost interest around the middle of the film although I did watch it until the end. The music, EXCEPT that which was played during the end credits, was unbearable, too loud, and almost embarrassing. I did admire the fact that the stars (in their 50's and 60's) decided to show themselves the way they really look, which is just fine.",1439078400,,967,4.463276836158192

6396529,1,B00JXFHSEE,"Both of these actors are faves of mine, but this mess was not worthy of either--especially Thompson. The music was so incongruent and annoying that, added to the silliness of the premise, I turned it off about 30 minutes in. Not sure I've ever done that before. Perhaps it was the director's fault--or the writer's; I hate to blame the actors, but this just didn't work for me",1438819200,,376,4.544117647058823

Why two such excellent actors as Pierce and Emma Thompson would star in this pathetic movie is beyond me  It isn't funny, and it isn't remotely believable.  Here is a normal couple (Pierce and Emma) who decide to steal a ten million dollar diamond to save a stolen pension fund.  The owner of the diamond bought Pierce's company and took all the money.  His main asset is the diamond.  The couple get their best friends to help the steal it back.  These people are no James Bond characters, to be sure.  Actually, I was embarrassed for all of them, just watching the screenplay.  Unlike other reviewers, I did watch it until then end, although I fast forwarded through the especially boring scenes..

Nonetheless, I would like to see more movies made by this director, given that he has many options for personalities/actors. I would like him to work with Ben Affleck. He and another woman in this movie would have probably earned an four star rate. For cuteness, fun, love to travel appeal, freshness. So, what about a remake?

Yes, there are a few very funny lines, but taken as a whole my most prominent feeling was one of disappointment. Pierce Brosnan's and Emma Thompson's reputations certainly take a hit on this one.  I'm sure the location in Southern France was a major draw during a stretch of free time. The plot is farcicial, and it is hard to have good acting with plotlines and scenes that cannot be perceived in even distant reality.

6396734,2,B00JXFHSEE,"What you want to watch is ""RED"" and ""RED 2"" where a cast of aging (and aged) movie stars convincingly play the roles of retired CIA operatives whom the CIA itself considers Retired Extremely Dangerous.  There the skill sets are matched to the actors employing them, and their age, and the audience is drawn in and taken for a very amusing ride.

Here, Hollywood has chosen two of its more genteel actors (Emma Thompson and Pierce Brosnan) and thrown in a couple of others as clowns (Timothy Spall and Celia Imrie) and set them off on an adventure that anyone with any functioning brain cells could not imagine them succeeding at.  It seems that, on the eve of his retirement, Brosnan's character's company has been bought out by a hedge fund wonder of irritating youth and he's convinced them to merge their pensions with his;  then he drives their company into the ground such that they show up to work one day to find themselves locked out, with foreclosure notices on the doors.  It turns out that for Brosnan and his ex, Thompson, not only is their pension gone, but so too is their mortgage money and their kid's college tuitions.  So, after some clandestine online investigating, they find that the creton's HQ is in Paris, and off they go.

You know, being a brash young thing, they, being Respectable, Upper Middle Class Elders;  they will simply go and have a talk with him and bring him to his senses.  Sadly, nothing else in the movie is any more plausible than this.  With the vagaries of the Anglo-American Capitalist System behind him (what he did was wrong, but legal) he has them thrown out.  They then discover he's about to get married, and that he bought the Rainbow Diamond (just on the news for its $10,000,000.00 sale to an anonymous buyer) to give to her.

They decide to crash his high security wedding and steal the diamond.  And this is where my sympathy for the film evaporated.  Stealing, and fencing a named diamond is the stuff only the best heist films can carry off.  This is not one of those films.  Worse, with this plot, not only is the idea itself preposterous, but this bunch of nitwits never do anything the easy way.  They complicate everything.  They choose the path of greatest resistance  that  requires skill sets the audience can not believe they would possibly have, let alone the stamina to exploit them, At Their Age...

Of course, the standard for Rom Com's is fairly low, but this doesn't even reach that bar.  The settings are beautiful, as is Emma Thompson, but that's not enough to carry this silly tale.",1412985600,,2556,4.633333333333334

It was so refreshing to see a romance comedy between the 50+ and it doesn't hurt that both of them are absolutely gorgeous. I can only hope to look like her in 20 years, she was amazing on film, always is, but I've never seen her in this type of role before. And i must say supporting actors Timothy Spall and Celia Imrie were perfect.

6396835,3,B00JXFHSEE,"Emma Thompson in a comedy, especially after her performances during the 2013-2014 award season, sounds like a sure bet for laughter right? After all, she seems more than comfortable with herself, seems equally deep and hilarious, and then she has Pierce Brosnan as a tag team partner in the movie. Leading to the question: Does this film live up to expectations?

Characters & Story

During Richards (Pierce Brosnan) last week before retirement, he finds out the man he sold his company to, Vincent (Laurent Lafitte), has pretty much destroyed all he has worked for after 25 years. His pension is gone, his ex-wifes Kate (Emma Thompson), Richards employees, and the building of the company Richard formerly ran is in foreclosure. Making it so those near retirement, and nowhere near, are all in a terrible position.

So, in order to right this wrong, Richard and Kate use the little bit of money they have left to head to France and confront Vincent. Something which leads to them being kicked out of Vincents building and them deciding they are going to steal Vincents wifes $10 million diamond to refund all the money Vincent stole. Something which requires the help of Vincent and Kates son Matt (Jack Wilkinson), as well as Richard and Kates friends Penelope (Celia Imrie) and Jerry (Timothy Spall).
Leading to a caper type film which has light espionage, a damsel in distress, a bickering former married couple, and Jerry who seemingly did quite well in the military and made loads of friends.

Praise

If you were to look at each of the protagonists stories, in terms of what happened before the movie, you are given interesting tales. Whether it is Jerrys career in the military, which has led to shrapnel and forceps being found in his body; Richard and Kates relationship, which perhaps began too soon; or even Richards pursuit of younger woman and building up his company. With all that is told to us, you are given a wealth of background information. All of which create this sense that these characters have lived full lives before we met them, and that after all the sacrifices and the interesting lives theyve lived, they deserve their pension money to relax.

Criticism

However, as much as their little tidbits about what happened in the past are interesting, nothing we see in the present has the same effect. Watching Thompson and Brosnan go back and forth throughout the movie is neither appealing nor funny, and it doesnt even have the passion the bickering between Nick and Meg in Le Week-End had to make it interesting. The jabs are all very shallow and while you see two attractive people who look good together, there is a real lack of chemistry that makes it hard to invest in either their past, or possibly future, relationship, much less their friendship.

Then, on top of that, honestly Jerrys random stories about being in the military were strangely more interesting than what most of the film offered. This is despite Thompson and Brosnan kidnapping, and impersonating, Texans; having a will they get back together, or won't they, type of relationship; and Thompson giving motherly advice to Vincents bride Manon (Louise Bourgoin), of which had one quotable line amongst their conversations.

Overall: Skip It

A part of me wants to say this is something which should be labeled TV Viewing, but in all honesty I think there isn't much here to really garner wasting an hour and a half of your life. Brosnans charm is there, but there isn't much chemistry between him and Thompson; and while Thompson attempts to be funny, the script doesnt seem geared to her talents at all. If anything, all you get is a story about a divorced couple of which one half speaks on how happy they are they aren't married to the other; we listen to Kate, Richard, and Jerry remind us constantly that they are old; and overall you get the feeling that if they were going to use these characters, minus Vincent and Manon, for a movie, it should of took place when they were still interesting and worth making a film about. Hence the Skip It label. The character, not actors mind you, are past the point where they can do or say anything interesting, and really this whole lets steal a diamond story seems barely evolved out of being an interesting concept.",1410566400,,4264,4.789115646258503

Every minute there was a new plot twist, to horrify and keep us from sleeping. Brosnan did what he could with the abysmal script, which was not much. There's only so much polish you can put on a turd. Thompson is usually a delight to watch, and this film, apparantly made after she died a horrible death from embarrassment of being cast, IMHO, is a statement from the writer that he never wants to be paid. Not ever. Can we get our $5.99 back? Probably not. Oh, and where was the Love Punch? Nobody punched anybody, ever. At least they had a good explosion. Off-screen.",1410048000,,703,4.5

6396968,4,B00JXFHSEE,This is an agreeable piece of froth that goes down well that only wears out its welcome towards the last fifteen minutes or so.  Not entirely original or fresh but stars Emma Thompson and Pierce Brosnan have terrific chemistry and play off each other well.  The central caper about stealing a diamond necklace is trite and predictable but who's going to argue when you have company like this.  After so many years in corsets and petticoats Thompson deserves a change of scenery and the Riviera setting does wonders for her.  If you're going to burn brain cells this is the way to go.,1409356800,3,583,4.631067961165049
6396969,4,B00JXFHSEE,"It seems to me these days that romantic comedies want to attempt to elevate themselves above the genre rather than embrace it. Long forgotten are those classic comedies that included romance and instead we're left with romantic comedies that seem to feel the need to include an agenda as well. Forget that folks, let's have some fun here. A romantic comedy is not likely to alter the course of history in any sense of the word. They are mostly enjoyable pieces of fluff that are fun to watch and perhaps garner a second viewing. They entertain. I'd much rather have those than be preached to about how a woman doesn't need a man to get along in life only to find the man of her dreams within seconds of making that pronouncement. So it was a joy to watch THE LOVE PUNCH, a romantic comedy that brought back memories of Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn at their best.

Pierce Brosnan plays Richard, an executive about to retire from the day to day grind. Emma Thompson plays Kate, his ex-wife who has never quite adjusted to single life. Their youngest child is off to college and both seem to be adjusting. All that changes when Richard goes to his last day at the office only to find that the company has been sold and the purchaser has legally taken all funds that were connected with the company, including the pension fund set aside for the employees. With the pension gone Richard has lost everything as has Kate who was tied into it as well. What to do? Discover who the purchaser was and appeal to his sense of right and wrong.

The duo high tails it to Paris where they intend to confront the scoundrel. They sneak into his office, tell him that this isn't fair and are quickly removed from said office. In fact the purchaser could care less about employees or their fate; he's more concerned about making money. On the side walk they see a glimpse of this as the man's fianc gets out of her limousine wearing a diamond around her neck Kate saw a news story on, a diamond worth $10 million.

Once seen Kate comes up with a plan: steal the diamond and sell it off giving the proceeds to the employees. A crazy idea at best and a wonderful caper film of sorts on which to base this comedy. Unable to do the job on their own the pair bring aboard their best friends, a couple they'd been friends with for years. Jerry (Timothy Spall) and Penelope (Celia Imrie) think the pair have reunited and are thrilled. When the plot is laid out for them they are eager to join in on the conspiracy.

To pull off their job they must first gain information on the house and what is going on with the thief's planned wedding. Kate does this by befriending his bride to be, a woman unsure that she is making the right decision. Words of wisdom from Kate cause her to think back to her own life and the love she once had for Richard. Is it possible the feelings are still there?

Next they must kidnap two couples from Texas, business associates of the bad guy, so they can take their invitations and impersonate them at the wedding reception. This in turn leads to them finding a way to the party and getting in, bypassing fingerprint scanners that have also been installed. Afterwards they only need to pretend to be from Texas, find a way to the diamond and then escape. Simple. Then again this is a comedy.

It's nice to see Brosnan step outside of the tough guy persona he's built up over the past few years since he became Bond and return to some comedic roots. Many have probably forgotten the comedy gift he displayed as Remington Steele. Thompson has always had a flair for comedy in the past that equals her ability with drama. Putting the two of them together in this piece was brilliant casting and it works spectacularly. Even the supporting cast shines here when Imrie and Spall having some hilarious moments.

Sure, the story here seems impossible and improbable. But that's not why we're watching this movie. We're watching to have a good time. We're watching to see if they can get away with this crime and save the day for the hard working people in their lives. And we're watching with the hope that these two separate people can find the love they once had and reunite. Is there a happy ending? Watch and see. You may not want to watch this over and over again but you'll have a good time watching it from start to finish.",1409356800,19,4331,4.440251572327044
