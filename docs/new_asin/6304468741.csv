7873447,4,6304468741,"There is allot of good information on this subject, but ther is also too much time spent dispelling and trying to find rational explanations for the triangle. I guess that's good, but I was really looking for something to get me more into the mythical and mysterious aspect of it all.
I do believe it's a good idea to hear both sides and all the facts, so in that respect, it was a very good show.",1336176000,,397,4.2368421052631575

7873449,3,6304468741,"The program itself as originally broadcast (on-screen title: ""The Case of the Bermuda Triangle"") deserves 5 stars despite the fact that it is over 30 years old and not much (if any) attention is paid to the Bermuda Triangle anymore.  Hopefully it's because of programs like this that helped viewers become more critical thinkers.  The program came out at a time when the Triangle and ""ancient astronauts"" were all the rage; best selling books and countless ""documentaries"" were in wide circulation.  In just its first few years, NOVA became a ""breath of fresh air"" in an intellectual atmosphere polluted by self-proclaimed experts who, sadly to their credit, were able to take advantage of the gullibility of so many in the mass media audience.

That being said, both the prerecorded videocassette and its only other format, laserdisc, contain an altered version of the original program.  To begin with, the last words spoken by author Lawrence Kusche where he says that ""The Bermuda Triangle mystery is probably one of the greatest hoaxes that's ever been pulled off"" (just before the segment with Philip Klass) has been cut out.  The original background music performed by Tangerine Dream (from their 1975 live album ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ricochet/dp/B00000DR5D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ricochet</a>"") has been replaced with a nondescript orchestral recording, most likely due to copyright issues.  Finally, even though this program was first broadcast in 1976, the series title sequence used is the one from the early '80s (their first attempt at using CGI).

As I've stated in other reviews of NOVA videos, I find the fact that the program you buy is not always the program you saw (and heard) rather frustrating.  I strongly suggest to other fans of NOVA that, as much as possible, first preview a public library or rental copy of a prerecorded videocassette or DVD to verify that the content is complete before plunking down good money on a purchase.",1176422400,3,2007,5.325949367088608
7873450,5,6304468741,"I think it is important for everyone, especially young people, to see this episode of Nova.  As a previous reviewer noted, it teaches critical thinking in a non-condescending way.  Even better, I think it shows that the process of ferreting out the truth about such ""mysteries"" can be much more exciting and interesting than simply swallowing the nonsense whole.

I strongly recommend that every parent and every teacher have their kids watch this.",1160092800,2,448,5.109589041095891
