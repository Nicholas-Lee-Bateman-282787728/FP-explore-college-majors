7824323,4,6302311543,"This DVD reissue of the Kirov's Sleeping Beauty was filmed in Montreal during the company's 1989 Canadian tour and offers a classic example of the ballet troupe's excellence, which shines through despite the poor quality of the dated video.

Under the expert baton of Viktor Fedotov, the Kirov orchestra plays wonderfully, and the dancing is impeccable. Larissa Lezhnina, having just turned 20 at the time, is an ideal Princess Aurora. Yulia Makhalina, who would go on to star as Odette/Odile in the Kirov's 1990 film of Swan Lake&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tchaikovsky-Petipa-Swan-Lake-Kirov-Ballet-Yulia-Makhalina-Igor-Zelensky/dp/B000G1ALF2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tchaikovsky, Petipa - Swan Lake / Kirov Ballet, Yulia Makhalina, Igor Zelensky</a>, makes for luxury casting as the Lilac Fairy. Students from the L'cole superieure de danse du Quebec and L'cole de danse Eddy Toussaint add charm to the Kirov's Canadian tour performance. Farukh Ruzimatov performs the role of Prince Dsir superbly, and the fairy-tale dancers of Act III are all outstanding.

Even without such stars and attractions, Vadim Guliayev's Carabosse raises the Kirov's Sleeping Beauty far above the ordinary. Portraying Carabosse requires a delicate balance between being genuinely evil and degenerating into a cardboard-cutout caricature. Guliayev nails it.

Besides the less-than-ideal video quality, a secondary shortcoming of the Kirov's Sleeping Beauty is its use -- still standard in the Soviet Union of 1989 -- of Konstantin Sergeyev's 1952 revision of Marius Petipa's original 1890 choreography. As Tim Scholl explains in his excellent study, ""Sleeping Beauty, a Legend in Progress,"" the deification of Tchaikovsky as the Soviets' ""official"" composer raised problematic issues of political correctness when it came to staging a ballet set in an imperial court that should have been anathema to the workers' state.

Thus, certain elements in Sleeping Beauty needed ""improvement."" The pageantry in Sergeyev's version of the Prologue, for example, is considerably reduced, and the scene at the beginning of Act I in which the peasant women are knitting despite King Florestan's having forbidden the activity is slightly cut back.

Sergeyev also limited pantomime, ballet's substitute for conversation, which was frowned upon by Soviet authorities who favored stories whose action could be clearly understood by a proletarian audience. Reducing the mime forced Sergeyev into awkward compensations at certain points. In the Prologue, for instance, cutting out the crucial exchange of information between Carabosse and the Lilac Fairy about the curse Carabosse has placed on the infant Aurora requires the appearance of a child princess so that Carabosse can demonstrate the doom that awaits her. To contemporary viewers, the reason for child's brief appearance is likely to be an inexplicable distraction.

More confusing is the scene in Act I after Aurora has been wounded by the spindle prick and is carried inside the castle. Instead of explaining in mime that Aurora is not dying but only sleeping, as Petipa's 1890 staging allowed, here the Lilac Fairy breaks into what seems to be a celebratory dance (concocted entirely by Sergeyev) that seems completely at odds with the more somber mood of the moment.

Even so, the bulk of the Kirov's performance flows with aplomb. The panorama at the end of Act II creatively superimposes slow-motion scenes of Dsir's vision of Aurora as the Lilac Fairy guides him toward her. Act III is especially successful. Partly because of including the often-omitted brief march accompanying Aurora's and Dsir's entrance and partly because of Fedotov's spirited conducting, the final act unfolds as a natural wedding celebration rather than as nothing more than a disjointed collection of individual dance pieces as it sometimes appears.
