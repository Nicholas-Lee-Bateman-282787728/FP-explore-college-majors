Seeing it now as an adult enjoying the classic touch of its time. The story is played out with no over the top acting. Grant Williams, carries the film with sincere acting. The story is very believable with all its scientific jargon. Universal does well when they remaster the footage.",1423353600,16,447,4.530864197530864

6755699,5,B00OL007TE,"This 50's sci-fi feature was always one of my late-night TV favorites.
The story has a unique take on alien invaders - instead of bug-eyed space-monsters, the bad guys are a mindless, relentless chemical process.
The production values are impressive for the time (and probable budget). An above-average script, some decent character actors, some halfway-convincing science and technobabble, and some very interesting effects and miniature photography. Good pacing, AND an uncredited early Henry Mancini soundtrack.
I never saw this in a movie theater, and the low-quality (TV broadcast - to - VHS - to - DVD?) transfers out there only served to intrigue me over what this movie SHOULD look like.
Well, this new release looks GREAT. Nice contrast, sharp detail, clean audio. Lots of interesting composite and miniature effects shots that, while not always convincing (par for the course for the time), are very good-looking.
It's a little on the pricey side, especially since it has no special features and was burned instead of pressed, but for real fans of the movie, this is the disk to buy.",1511136000,,1093,5.111731843575419

6755710,5,B00OL007TE,"A meteorite crashes in the California desert and breaks on contact, spreading its EVIL over the area.  Add water and presto, they become monoliths that grow, crash, break, and grow some more.  A hapless geologist (Phil Harvey as Ben), brings one of the fragments to his home office.  In the night the stone is watered and spreads, killing poor Ben through petrifaction.  Every ounce of silicon is sucked out of his body by the killer stones.  When the district head of geology (Grant Williams as Dave) returns from a business trip he finds the office in ruins and poor Ben standing around like a statue.  Soon others are turning to stone through proximity with the killer fragments.  A rainstorm causes the stones to grow to the size of monoliths and they are heading for San Angelo.  Can anything stop their insidious progress?  Or.  Will a little seasoning do the trick?

Fabulous FX by Clifford Stine.  A nifty idea.  And above all else, fun.",1496793600,,945,4.723926380368098

6755712,4,B00OL007TE,"Love my oldies but goodies, and I was in the mood to see this oldie, which is rarely seen anywhere, anymore.  I used to have a pre-teen crush on Grant Williams anyway, and he was in so few movies, so it was so nice to see him in this one.  Movies like this used to be what scared us half to death, only this one was slightly different than most from its time, because the ""monsters"" weren't creatures that one would think of, they were actually remnants of a meteor which broke up when it crashed into earth, and would grow when it was touched by water.  It was pretty scary stuff because those rocks kept growing into monstrous sizes, which crashed down onto whatever was near it when the water source stopped. On top of that, anyone who actually came into contact with it while it while it was growing, turned to stone.  This movie doesn't waste too much time getting anyone to believe what was going on, either, so the story progressed at a nice pace, another reason to like it.
All in all, if you're looking for a good-old fashioned '50s movie, and with good storytelling, curl up with a bag of popcorn and enjoy this one.",1495756800,,1126,4.347619047619047

This is a movie about great big rocks that grow out of the ground and fall on things.  1950's sci-fi can be really good, and I often like seeing again the old ""Dialing for Dollars"" movies I used to watch on weekdays after school.  Maybe this one lost something in the journey to a finished film, but it's no more than a mediocre Outer Limits episode that goes on far too long.",1493251200,,399,4.142857142857143

6755718,4,B00OL007TE,"When I started watching this, I was expecting something like that old Outer Limits episode about the killer rocks; turns out the ""monster"" part of the title is a slight exaggeration - the monoliths are much more like a natural disaster than a malevolent force, but that doesn't make the story any less interesting. The acting is good, the FX are decent for the time (i.e. nothing was obviously fake or a miniature), and there's none of the casual mysogeny or sexism you'd normally expect in a movie this old - the leading woman, while a minor player, is capable and level-headed.
The logic of the monoliths and their downfall is slightly shaky (can't say more without spoilers), but it could have been a lot worse - mainly, the lead characters make an assumption that seems backwards to me.
All in all, a decent flick, and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys other sci-fi from this era.",1491091200,3,888,4.6265822784810124

Amazingly frightening monoliths, good special effects, intriguing and unique story, horrifying to think what would happen when beings multiply exponentially how quickly the Earth would be doomed if they aren't stopped.  Love the desert setting, small town atmosphere, and fairly realistic way the characters struggle to understand what's happening, why, and what to do about it.

What I like about it is that the monster of the title is just a bunch of rock. No creature, no agenda. It makes the whole thing a bit more sinister as there is no reason for whats happening. It's simply a fact of nature and that makes it harder for the hero and friends to actually cope with finding solutions. A fun look back for me",1481846400,,496,4.071428571428571

The ""monsters"" in this movie were simply rocks from outer space that grew to the size of skyscrapers when exposed to water and absorbed silicon to build themselves rather than the typical living creature that attacks out of hunger, etc. which makes this movie unique.

6755744,4,B00OL007TE,"Mid-1950s B sci-fi movies are some of the best ever made, and Monolith Monsters (1957) is among the top of these.  In this flick a fireball from deep space punches into the California desert near the tiny town of San Angelo carrying a geologic threat.  No blood sucking monster this time, rather a believable change in geology that threatens the townspeople and the earth itself.  Unusual for this era of sci-fi, there is no massive military mobilization, no bickering scientists, and no hideous lifeform with a super brain for the humans to outwit.  Rather, it is the seemingly unalterable advance of great columns of rocks which grow at an alarming rate, then crack apart to collapse, shatter, and rise again from each fragment.  Wow.  How to you stop that?

The black and white filming is crisp with good half tones and no washed out sequences.  Special effects, always a must for good sci-fi, are extremely well done, particularly the miniatures.  What is exceptional is the feeling that the massive columns of falling stone are truly heavy.  The sensation that ponderous, unstoppable pillars of rock are approaching is critical to the movie and the special effects fellows do not disappoint.  Part of the fun in watching these movies is seeing how they handle small budgets, and these guys did great.

The writers added a bit of horror to the film by making people turn to stone under some circumstances.  Which circumstances are never explained, but, hey, its low budget.  Other problems, such as why the MDs did not amputate a girls arm as it was turning to stone, or what happens when it rains again, also go unexplained.  As in all of these movies some suspension of rationality is necessary.

Acting in B movies cant be expected to be A+, but the players in Monolith Monsters do a creditable job, turning in no less than solid C+ to B level performances.  As always, the female lead is beautiful beyond belief, the male star handsome as Elvis, and their romantic relationship grows as the movie advances.  All good stuff.  In 1957 the director didn't have to put people into bed together.  A few longing glances followed by a passionate kiss was about all that was required to make the love is in the air point.

Monolith Monsters hits all the common B movie sci-fi formula points: isolated location, small group of humans (a group is necessary because a couple of them have to die), unearthly threat, girl/boy (never wife/husband) romance that blossoms as the threat advances.  Many times the girl is put in direct danger, but not here. There is also the virtually universal (no pun) scene where the main cast stands around watching as the threat is destroyed.  Normally, the troupe is facing the camera while the action takes place behind the camera.  They are supposed to act frightened or anxious, but thats hard to do.  The actors seldom pull this off well, and this motion picture isn't an exception.  Still, watch for it and enjoy the attempt at fright/horror/anxiousness/whatever.

A very good film for a look at how sci-fi was done in the 1950s, and done well.

The old-timey cars would be worth a mint now and when the people drive them at night there are lights on the inside so you can see who is driving.

One of my favorite sci-fi actors is William Schallert. He only has a small part as the weatherman but it makes this an official 50's sci-fi movie.

I thought I saw this before but found that all I remember is that this film is the subject of many documentaries.

6755767,4,B00OL007TE,"Made in 1957, let's get that out of the way immediately, black and white. The acting? So-so. Why 4 stars? the story is one I thought was original and never done before or maybe even since. Black reflective looking meteors crash in the desert, when they get wet they grow to huge proportions and then collapse etc, and so on. Silly or dull? not really it was different and I loved it. how to stop them from cascading all across the world? You have to watch this well done classic to find out. Why the small town third grade school teacher is involved in everything....beyond me, but what does it matter.",1431993600,6,602,4.4324324324324325
