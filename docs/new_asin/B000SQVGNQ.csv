8206501,3,B000SQVGNQ,"Sometimes, it almost reminded me of The War with Kevin Costner, but not quite. The plot is okay, but what really makes it worth watching is David Strathairn. He's a brilliant every-man actor and does a good job with the character he is given, hinting at the depth that the writers never got around to writing. Gregory Smith does a good job in his role as the son. I also really like the daughter. I wish she had more screen time because she was entertaining. Plot gets 2 stars, but Strathairn and Smith bump this movie up to 3 stars.",1233532800,,533,4.34
