1949452,5,B0000VD02E,"This is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen in my life. Everything about this film is cool, entertaining, enjoyable and stunning to look at. The scenery is gorgeous and Diane Lane delivers one of the years best performances. I hear Oscar calling!? This is a stunning film that is not only different from the normal rom-com, but a refreshing and enjoyable ride through what life is to all of us. Well done to everyone involved! Stunning!",1064361600,3,447,4.670886075949367
1949453,5,B0000VD02E,"Diane Lane is amazing in this lovely, joyful romp through the glorious Tuscany region of Italy. This is a heartfelt and deeply affecting film that will live on long after the final credits have rolled. This film will make you go home and pack your bags for the beautiful scenery on view. The acting is top-notch with Diane Lane giving yet another Oscar calibre performance (remember last years' ""Unfaithful""?!) and she carries the film really well. Everyone else I saw this film with absolutely loved it and I'm sure it will be a big hit if given the chance. It deserves to be as it is a really enjoyable and lovely romp through Tuscany and all it's charms. Highly recommended indeed.",1064188800,2,684,4.661157024793388
1949454,5,B0000VD02E,"I was blown away by how wonderful this moving and funny film was. It has everything you could want. Drama, comedy, great acting and beautiful landscapes and music. Diane Lane should win another Oscar nomination for her great work here and the supporting cast were superb with their often quirky portrayals. The film is sweet but not cliched and there is nothing at all the fault it on. A faultless and beautiful film. The best of the year in my opinion. It's a 10!",1064188800,,464,4.535714285714286
1949455,4,B0000VD02E,"I am not a huge fan of the romantic comedy genre. More often than not, a romantic comedy is nothing more than a few good looking people thrown together and saddled with a lousy script. That's not to say that there aren't notable exceptions, but for the most part they suck. Based on the previews for this movie, I didn't have high hopes, however I did receive a free pass to watch a sneak preview for the movie, so how could I say no?
Having not read the book, I really didn't know what to expect. Let me tell you it was a pleasant surprise. For starters, Diane Lane was the perfect choice for the lead character Frances Mayes. She brings a natural reality to the character, instead of the saccharin sweet typically found in a romantic comedy. Diane instantly makes you feel like you know this woman. She's your neighbor, or someone you work with. In the scene after she learns of her husband's infidelities, she looks horrible - exactly like you'd expect like a woman would look after traumatic news. Of course Diane Lane is a very beautiful woman and as the movie progresses that becomes more and more apparent. Luckily Diane is more than just a pretty face and her performance is stellar. The movie as a whole is understated, letting things play out instead of spelling everything out and Diane provides a wonderful tapestry for you to see what is happening to her. Her reactions tell you more than pithy dialog ever could and as a result you end up taking the journey with her.
As much as I loved Diane Lane in this movie, she is surrounded by an incredible supporting cast. Sandra Oh, as the best friend, delivers an authentic performance. Instead of the typical ""funny sidekick"" so often played by those in the role of best friend, she's down to earth and real. Raoul Bova plays the Italian lover and should make most women weak in the knees, but I found Vincent Riotta, the real estate agent, to be a much richer character. And speaking of rich characters, Lindsay Duncan plays a wonderful eccentric as Katherine who almost serves as a fairy godmother.
Although the acting is surpurb, what brings it all together are the talents of Audrey Wells who serves as the screenplay writer, director and producer. Most of Audrey's background has been in writing. This is only her second film as a director, yet you wouldn't know it by watching the film. Clearly Ms. Wells has a love of Italy and a love of the novel and all of that shows on the screen. She filmed in the cities that are represented and she hired actors that are the nationality in which they play and the age in which they should be. The entire films shines with authenticity and coupled with wonderful performances and directing, Audrey has redefined the romantic comedy.
This movie was refreshing, witty, poetic, dramatic and rich with characters that you not only like, but identify with. It was such a breath of fresh air that I'm ready to see it again and again.",1063929600,7,2932,4.576045627376426
1949456,4,B0000VD02E,"San Francisco based writer, college professor and book critic, Frances Mayes, hits the emotional skids when she is informed of her husband's extramarital affair and finds herself immersed in a divorce that lands her in a dismal hotel complex inhabited by sad and scarred victims of separation.  Even though she is caught in the tailspin of her own disappointment, she accepts the gift of a trip to Tuscany from friends and embarks on a journey that will gradually fuel her life with optimism.  On impulse, she purchases a ramshackle farmhouse in the countryside near Cortena and sets upon the seemingly impossible task of its renovation while simultaneously reinventing her own sensibilities and her lifestyle in general.  As she toils under the Tuscan sun as an outsider to the town and its people, she finds herself becoming one of them, seeing each of the lives she encounters as an individual quest for La Dolce Vita so poignantly captured in Fellini's film and echoed by the aging Anita Ekberg wannabe who attempts to and advises Frances to retain a childlike innocence and exuberance when viewing any situation in the big bad world.

With a lead like Diane Lane playing Frances, there must. of course, be a man, in this case a delicious hunk of Italian that cavalierly convinces Frances and the cameras to follow him from the ochre magnificence of Rome to the tiered splendor of the Amalfi coast.  These sequences explode with so much visual pleasure the viewer sighs, involuntarily blinded by the sensual overload of color and sound and as expected, glimpses of both Lane and her lover as they frolic to the tune of the campanile's bells.

For those who have read the book of the same name, there is no comparison.  These are completely different stories.  If you are expecting the idyllic sweetness of the book with its anecdotes of Italian life, forget it.  The movie-Frances dwells on her divorce which springboards her into asking some of life's big questions, while the book-Frances has already worked all this out prior to writing the first page and immerses herself in the simple lovely indulgence of following the course of a sweet life of which she has already mapped out.  The ""Ed"" that Frances finds at the end of the film, is with the book-Frances from the very start; in fact, they renovate the house together, content from the outset.

I entered the theatre expecting this film to be mediocre based on the ubiquitous trailers seen on television which try far too hard to make the film seem cutsy rather than stimulating.  My advise is to watch none of these sugary confections which take words of dialogue out of context to appeal to a certain audience; if you like all things Italian and are indeed, searching for a dolce vita of your own, go see the film.  Disregard the obvious contrivances in the plot and prepare yourself to fall in love with the lush scenery that gently lulls that annoying sense of American expediency out of existence, for at least the two hour viewing time.  Above all, view the film with the childlike pleasure of the Italians for whom every experience is a new one to be savored. Then go out and buy a copy of the book La Dolce Vita offered on Amazon.com to begin your own quest for the sweet life.",1063670400,6,3247,4.744227353463588
1949457,4,B0000VD02E,"My wife and I saw Under the Tuscan Sun at a sneak preview screening and enjoyed it tremendously.  Fans of the book shouldn't have too many issues with the creative license taken, although I felt like I would have liked to have seen more about the culture and the house worked into the story, and less emphasis on some of the added characters such as the eccentric lady in the village.
The movie kept me laughing and even stirred up a few tears, and only crossed the line into camp a couple of times. Overall it is a good solid romantic comedy with integrity, good performances, and beautiful photography.  Warning: it may make you want to pack for a trip to Europe.",1063584000,2,665,4.442622950819672
1949458,4,B0000VD02E,I saw the movie last night in a preview showing.  I found it to be very charming.  The best part of the movie by far is the cinematography.  Tuscany and Italy in general are both places that I have never been before but just seeing this movie makes me want to go there all the more.  I felt that the story line of this movie has a few holes but otherwise is very entertaining.  My reccomendation would be to see this movie in a matine or wait until it comes out on video.,1062633600,2,471,4.021505376344086
1949459,5,B0000VD02E,"In a way, I liked this movie a lot more than perhaps I ought.  For one thing, I am a guy, and this is very definitely a chick flick (hint for the guys:  a great movie to take her on a date).  It is also a tad predictable, though it is not without a few surprises.  And at times it feels more like a succession of postcards than a film, so perfect does Tuscany look throughout the picture.
So why did I enjoy it so much?  First, because of the very wonderful performance of Diane Lane as Frances Mayes, the real life author of the book upon which this film is based (and which I must confess I have not read).  In my mind, Lane has always been way, way underutilized by Hollywood.  She has always shown herself to be an actress of the highest caliber, but for some reason she has not always been granted the kinds of roles that she ought to have received.  She is onscreen in this film for very nearly the entire length, and the film is all the better for that.  She is also quite beautiful in a seemingly accessible way, and I really loved watching her marvelously expressive face throughout the film.
Although the film really does, as I mentioned above, seem sometimes like a succession of postcards or the pictures of a Tuscan calendar, there is no question that the film is surreally beautiful.  The town of Cartona looks so exquisite that one is immediately seized with dreams of winning the lottery and moving therewith.  It is quite easy to understand why anyone would love to live in such a marvelous place.  And the brief scenes in Positano make it look like a perhaps even more beautiful spot than Cartona.  There is no question:  this is a very gorgeous movie to look at, though perhaps a tad too perfect.  One begins to wonder if there were imperfections in the region that the camera chose to ignore.  But no matter; this is a fantasy, and the beauty was quite appropriate to the mood of the film.
The villa that she purchases more or less becomes one of the major characters in the film.  It is lovely thing, a bit dilapidated at the beginning, but by the end of the film it is transformed to something cared for and caring in return.  The prospect from the villa is breathtaking, with the gently rolling hills filling most of the view, with mountains in the distant.  Her bedroom is definitely a room with a view.  This is all played to great advantage in the remarkable scene were a lightening storm seems to ravage the area, with a lightening bolt striking a washing machine in her front yard, and with an owl flying into her bedroom to escape the chaos outside.
Finally, I enjoyed the collection of friends--for such they became in the end--in Tuscany.  Although Frances goes there as a stranger, by the end of the film she possesses a large and wide-ranging group of friends.  One comes to like and know them all, and feel some of the affection for them that Frances feels.
This is not one of the great films one is likely to see this year or any other, but it is a warm, likable, beautiful film, and it is hard to imagine many not giving in to its charms.",1062460800,,3074,4.375

Instead we get a canned formula boy meats girl (Diane Lane,) and girl meats girl (Sandra Oh,) and so forth. The villa just happened to be in the way of the story. And talk about slow and dragged out.

There are a few travel poster shots of Italy that are nice, but not any were worth the expense in time to wait for a story that never unfolds.

1949846,5,B0000VD02E,"Diane Lane is at her best in this story written by one of my favorite authors. The director captured the essence of the original script; and Diane played it to perfection! Congrats to all the supporting actors and staff, who made this production possible. Many of us have the innate desire to leave it all, and split the scene for a more comfortable, colorful, laid-back, cultural rich-out of the way place to call home. And since I've been to only a small part of Tuscany, I had a good feel for what the story would be like; at least the countryside. But having read John Mayes book of the same title, as well as several others; and having seen his other manuscript, ""A Good Year"", I just knew, that I would love this movie. In fact, I had already seen it several times, but didn't own it.
Diane Lane plays the part of one of the unlikely few females that find themselves having to pay alimony, after a nasty divorce. Then decides to chuck it all in the great USA, and go someplace to find herself again! So after arriving in Tuscany, she finds an old estate with appeal, and lots of surprises. After shrewd negotiating, and a little help from nature, she buys the estate. That's when the real fun begins...!
If you've seen ""The Good Year"", then you won't want to miss ""Under the Tuscan Sun!""",1491436800,5,1293,4.436974789915967

1950228,5,B0000VD02E,"Even though this movie is about Francis and her life after the divorce, it is the other characters in this lovely movie that make it just oh-so-perfect. Segnore Martini, the Italian lawyer or real estate agent who comes to her aid and checks up on her after the storm. Handsome and very proper, ""Segniora,"" he says, ""stops being so sad or I will be forced to make love to you and I have never been unfaithful to my wife"". Or Catherine, the lovely eccentric actress who was discovered by Fellini at sixteen and ends up in the fountain from one of his movie scenes. Yet, she tells Francis the truth about life, ""Go back to your house and forget about it"".
The three Polish men who work on Francis' home and their different personalities.

And Francis' best friend who is having a baby. Her first Italian lover who introduced himself as Marcello to which she said, ""Of course.""

Francis herself is amazing and in real life I would love to be her friend.

The dialogue in this gem is wonderful and flows beautifully. Diane Lane is one of my favorite actresses and this movie made me love her even more.",1468800000,3,1098,4.48

1950267,1,B0000VD02E,"An unhappily divorced American female writer only finds happiness by defining herself by more men who aren't all that interesting.

She didn't make much progress.

I like Diane Lane a lot but this movie only explores how to define yourself by other people--which is what caused her so much unhappiness in the first place. Frustratingly non-aware of the importance for anyone to cherish themselves first--so that they live a full life and, if it happens, are able to cherish someone else without expectation of ""getting"" something in return. That's not love: that's trading.

The male characters seem much more enlightened in this movie. I feel badly for the female protagonist. Her hero's journey more or less made a circle and came back to the beginning--setting her up for continued unhappiness when the next man leaves, whether for someone else, or for death, or where ever his own path leads.",1467504000,2,896,5.0

1951264,5,B0000VD02E,"To borrow a phrase from Madagascar-you've got to move it! That's what you'll feel like doing after watching this. Your story may not be a divorce, but if you are in a rut, sick and tired of where you are or ever dreamed of starting over, this is the movie for you. It's realistic in the sense that it clearly shows you have to do some sacrifices to have money saved up to move on, that it helps to have a friend or two that encourage you and that you need to have a career that is mobile (or at least can be useful wherever you decide to go). Once there you cannot hide in a cave but be bold and take necessary risks. The movie is all about your mindset in your new adventure. The house is pretty. In my opinion the movie would probably have been a bigger hit with a different actress. I like Diane Lane but would have liked to see an actress that has a knack for moving the audience more. Perhaps Ashley Judd, Julia Roberts, Kate Blanchette to name a few.  I do recommend watching it.  It's an entertaining movie.",1434153600,,1014,4.168367346938775

But the important part, the part that makes me truly love this movie, is the truth of love and loss of love; the loss of the sense of self; and the value of the different types of love we are lucky enough to experience in our lives. Most of our lives are lived in those spaces between the towering highs and the heart-wrenching lows, and this movie gives voice and power to those moments.",1430352000,,579,4.420560747663552

1951508,3,B0000VD02E,"This would have been a better movie if Diane Lane was more attractive and a better actress.  She only has about two expressions and does nothing at all with her voice and the dialogue.  And, she just looks old like she has in every role I've ever seen her in.  It's like they tried to fix her hair, tried to do something with her face then just gave up and left her dowdy. The role is written so that she is just tiresome.  First they throw an attractive man at her and we find out that he is married then toward the end of the film she throws this same man at the flamboyant blonde friend.  I assume he was still married.  Then she throws herself at a man she sees on the street in Rome, forgets about him while she entertains the terribly plain pregnant friend who shows up unannounced then is upset when months later he's not waiting for her to get around to him again.  The people who come to work on the house and their families are charming but definitely cookie cutter roles like every other American goes to Italy movie you've ever seen.  The movie just sort of drags, depends on the scenery mostly.  I think this could have been a very good movie but it was just miscast, badly written and directed.",1426377600,,1208,4.2631578947368425

1951555,5,B0000VD02E,"UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN is a chick-flick, mostly taking place in various scenic parts of Italy, with periodic scenes taking place in San Francisco, California. The dialogue is unusually intelligent. Although the plot invited the materialization of cinematographic cliches, it was rarely the case that a cliched plot element made an appearance. Actually, there was one cliched element, namely the romance between Pavel (a Polish immigrant laborer) and a teenaged Italian girl. The depiction of the rock-bottom, gnawing emotions that tend to dog victims of a messy break-up are painfully accurate in this movie. The continual barrage, and generous variety, of facial expressions from actress Diane Lane likely exceeds the variety and number of facial expressions from any other actor in any other film. The film has not one, but two surprise endings. In this review, I reveal the first, but not the second.

AT FIRST, THE MOVIE THREATENS TO BE ANOTHER BORING WOODY ALLEN MOVIE. The film begins with a book signing party. A young man with a hint of scruffy beard and long tousseled hair is before a crowd in a book store, proudly holding his new book. He speaks praise of his college writing teacher (Diane Lane), who is in the audience with her Asian friend (actress Sandra Oh). The young man says, ""She said something to me that changed everything. She said that terrible ideas are like playground scapegoats. Given the right encouragement, they can grow up to be geniuses. She told me to work on one of my terrible ideas."" The crowd provides an enthusiastic applause to the young author, and the young man exclaims that he'd like to give his former professor a ""French kiss."" Sorry, I'm married, replies Diane Lane merrily, displaying her wedding ring on her finger. Things are going merrily at this point, and the viewer might suspect that this will become another extremely boring Woody Allen movie about pseudo-intellectuals. But this is not what happens.

IRONY AND ECONOMY IN SCRIPTWRITING. A man appears from the crowd and engages in chit-chat with Diane Lane. As it turned out, the man is also an author, and it was the case that Diane Lane had published an unfavorable review about the man's book. In her review, she complained that is was unrealistic that a middle-aged man would live his teen fantasies by having an affair with a much younger lady. Then, the man from the crowd insists that the plot from his book was not unrealistic, because he'd based the plot on Diane Lane's husband (who was actively carrying on with a much younger lady). Diane Lane immediately understands the meaning of the man's comment, and without further ado, the next scene takes place in the office of a divorce lawyer. (I was truly amazed by the unusual economy of this scene. The director made no attempt to pad the scene, with depictions, for example, of Diane confronting her bad-behaving husband.)

ANGUISH AND DESPAIR IN THE LAWYER'S OFFICE. In the lawyer's office, Diane Lane's face looks a mess, reflecting her anguish and despair. (I am not sure what she did to herself to make it appear as though she'd been crying for several hours on end, but she succeeded in acquiring this appearance.) The lawyer tells Diane Lane that her husband's girlfriend has a child, and that the husband wants to keep the house because it is near a good school. This further twists the corkscrew of anguish into Diane Lane's heart, and the viewer will easily feel the woman's increasing pain.

CAMP DIVORCE AND EMPTY SHELL PEOPLE. In the next scene, Diane Lane moves into a small apartment, speaks with the landlord for a minute, then in her apartment collapses on the carpet in grief and despair. Through the walls, one can hear a divorced man, crying and moaning, because of his recent divorce. Diane Lane has reached rock-bottom. In the next scene, she calls up Sandra Oh, who plays a gay woman. Sandra is with her partner at home. They had been planning to go on a gay tour of Italy, but in sympathizing with Diane Lane, they invite her to accept one of their tour tickets. But Diane Lane is not receptive to this offer. ""What are you doing at Camp Divorce with all those losers,"" says Sandra Oh, regarding Diane's hesitance to accept the ticket. (I enjoyed the term, ""Camp Divorce."") ""I'm busy, I have to review all those books,"" says Diane, giving an excuse that her daytime job is keeping her too busy. Sandra Oh replies, ""I think you're in danger of never recovering. You known when you come across one of those empty shell people, and you think what the hell happened to you . . . this is no time to be a chicken s***.""

BACK AT THE APARTMENT. MORE ECONOMY IN SCRIPTWRITING. Diane is back at her desk, and the neighbor's weeping can be heard through the walls again. Diane calls Sandro Oh, and agrees to take the plane ticket. The only thing that Diane says over the telephone is, ""Patty, when do I leave?"" (Sandra Oh plays Patty.) (This part of the plot was really stunning to me, because of its great economy. In other words, a big shift in the plot occurred with the utterance with only five words: Patty, when do I leave?)

DIANE IN ITALY. The tour bus has a driver and host. The host says, ""Now I saw most of you hobnobbing, now Francis is straight and she just survived a terrible divorce, and she really needs our support. So Francis, why don't you stand up."" At this point, Diane Lane exhibits one, two, or perhaps three different emotions, and then without further hesitation, stands up with a broad smile. The gay men all applaud.

The host then ambles up and down the aisle of the bus, pouring wine into each of the cups held by all the passengers. (At this point, we are only 14 minutes into the movie.) We motion picture camera lovingly caresses the colorful flower arms in Tuscany, gothic churches, and a street market, complete with a honking goose, and colorful grapes. Diane Lane's first attempts at speaking Italian with the locals are amusing, but more important, they indicate her willingness to adapt and learn.

Diane pauses to chat with an American tourist, a young man. He asks her to writing a letter to his mom. Diane reads as she writes, and what she reads is, ""Dear Mom, it's market day in Cortona. The Piazza is an on-going party. Cliches converge at this navel of the world, you almost want to laugh. I eat a hot grape from the market and the violet sweetness breaks open in my mouth. It even smells purple."" The young American tourist does not like the letter, and he says that his mom would guess that he did not write it. So he hands the newly drafted letter to Diane Lane.

BUYING AN OLD COUNTRY HOUSE. At 20 minutes into the movie, Diane abandons the bus tour, and decides on impulse to purchase an old country house visible from the road. The house is owned by an elderly woman. A young German couple are also interested in buying the house. But Diane Lane outbids them. In disgust, the German woman says, ""You greedy Americans, you think you're so entitled, you ruin everything."" The old lady eventually changes her mind, and decides to keep the house. The old lady adds that she might sell the house if there is a ""sign."" Moments later, the ""sign"" does appear, and it takes the form of poop landing on Diane Lane's shoulder. The poop came from one of the wild pigeons that were flying around the livingroom.

DESCENDENTS OF ROMAN GODS. Diane talks with Sandra Oh, who is in San Francisco, and explains that she bought an old house. ""It needs a little work,"" says Diane Lane about her new villa in Tuscany. ""Who is going to do it,"" asks Sandra, knowing that Diane Lane doesn't know much about fixing houses. ""I am,"" exclaims Diane. ""Of course I didn't mean I was going to do all the work myself,"" she adds, ""I'm in Italy, I can hire the muscular descendents of Roman gods to do all the heaving lifting."" (I liked this bit of clever scriptwriting.)

PREMONITION. After Diane's mention of ""Roman gods,"" Sandra Oh remarks, ""Have you met him yet? The guy you're going to meet."" Diane Lane is taken by surprise, and she replies, ""Uh, who? Patty please!"" Diane does not give Sandra's comment any more thought, though the viewer can easily guess how the plotline will turn. At 57 minutes into the movie, Diane Lane is being pursued by four romantic young men, and in an effort to escape them, abruptly befriends a handsome young man. The result is shift in plot line, where there is a brief romance. Diane Lane plays the cougar, and the handsome Italian is the cub.

GETTING INTO ITALIAN CULTURE. In fixing up the old house, Diane polishes a round painting of Mother Mary. Then, a short bit later, at 30 minutes into the film, there is a scary thunderstorm at night, and Diane hides under her bed covers, and she reaches up to touch the image of Mother Mary, in order to feel more secure. A bit later, at 48 minutes into the movie, Diane states that she has become more fond of Mother Mary, even though she is not a Catholic.

THREE STOOGES. The next day (31 minutes into the film) we meet the men who will be fixing the house, they are Polish laborers, Pavel, Jerzy, and Zbignieu. The efforts of these men provide comic relief, and their goings on can be compared to those of THE THREE STOOGES, in particular, with the plumbing skit by THE THREE STOOGES. Pavel meets a local Italian teenager, and the result is a hackneyed but skillfully acted subplot.

""A LIFE THAT YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE."" At 44 minutes, Diane is speaking with a member of the family that had owned her new house. This person is a man in his mid-40s. He is busy helping her find a snake that had crawled from the garden into the house. ""What am I doing here all by myself,"" suddenly says Diane to herself. She is standing near the man hunting for the snake. ""Don't you think its strange? Me in this big house?"" Then, Diane catches herself, because she is aware that she is about to plunge into a pit of despair. ""Excuse me, I'm sorry"" says Diane, who is crying quietly to herself. The man exclaims that Diane might be cold, and he attempts to comfort her by placing a small blanket over her shoulders. Then she opens up even further about the pain of her divorce. ""I wake up in the middle of the night thinking, you idiot, you're the stupidest woman in the world. You bought a house for a life you don't even have.""

MORE IRONY. Then, Diane Lane continues to spill her heart out to the man, and she adds, ""I want a wedding in this house,"" referring to her hopes for her own future wedding. What is ironic, is that towards the end of the movie, a wedding does occur in the house, but it is a wedding between Pavel and the Italian teenaged girl. At the wedding, Diane remarks that her own wish had come true. But, as I mentioned above, this movie has second surprise ending, and I do not reveal it. So don't worry.

1952029,4,B0000VD02E,"A guy review of a chick flick-
This movie exists primarily as a vehicle for Diane Lane to look pretty.  She acquits that role admirably.  Lane is pretty in a fresh, wholesome, girl-next-store way.  Nothing flashy.  She even looks good in baggy coveralls and a bandana.

Lane smiles a lot.

Of course there is the gratuitous and obligatory suggestion of a sex scene (Lane looks good in a black bra as well), which neither adds to nor takes away from the fact that this movie essentially lacks a plot.  Well, I guess you could say Lane buys a dump of a villa and by the end of the movie she has turned it into a pretty nice place.

The movie represents that Lane can cook, and that's always a big plus.

Some nice views of the Italian countryside as well.",1406160000,,753,4.321428571428571

However, having read the book, when I saw it the second time I couldn't help but marvel at what a different impression it creates than what actually happened.  Even putting that aside, it is poorly written and acted, counting on the proverbial chick flick syndrome.",1405468800,,438,4.675324675324675

1952073,5,B0000VD02E,"I have watched Under the Tuscan Sun at least a half dozen times and it never loses its freshness. Each scene is a gem; the acting is superb; the growth of each character is stunning to watch. Diane Lane plays American writer Frances Mayes, an every-woman, a heroine who has plunged to the depths and must now crawl up to the surface to breathe lest she wallow in misery forever. She finds her safe harbor in Tuscany, a land of sunshine, sunflowers, and Mediterranean food that offers her the promise of a new start in a neglected villa called ""Bramasole"". In this quaint environment, Frances sheds her cocoon-like layers of self-doubt and failure and learns to love like an Italian, through food, religion, family, even if the family consists of your workmen, neighbors, and a dejected friend who is on the verge of motherhood. Under the Tuscan Sun will make you believe in fresh starts. It will make you believe in the power of prayer, and it will make you believe that, with all its chaos, life has a certain harmony that is perfect in its imperfectness.",1403568000,,1056,4.652406417112299

Diane Lane may be a famous and respected actor but in this one, she stinks! Her acting is stilted, amateurish and unbelievable, from the get go. It's like watching a high school play in terms of how authentic (not) that she seems in this role, throughout the film.

Don't waste your time on this one, unless you need something to help with insomnia.

I note that a lot of reviewers have said that the book is so much better. I might give it a read but I'm sorry I wasted a couple of hours watching this stinker. Just plain BAD!",1402704000,,668,4.203125

It was nothing like the book other than the house was quite charming, and there were some glimpses of Tuscany that were gorgeous.  Mostly it is about relationships.  So, if you are looking for the book on the screen, you won't find it.

After being screwed over by her first husband, and going to Tuscany reluctantly, one would not expect her then to LONG for yet another man to mess with her, and to buy a home she cannot afford in a remote place near a city she didn't even want to go.  There were some seriously contrived moments and lots of caricatures, but she also managed to be a mature, reliable friend, and a relatively wise advocate for a couple of teenagers.  Not great.  Not terrible.  And occasionally entertaining.",1392249600,,603,4.704761904761905

Most of us women going through a divorce aren't getting chased in the streets by men or flirted with at every given moment. I was hoping that in the end the lead character would embrace her own identity as a single woman. We don't all get the sweet and gorgeous guy in the end, so I was disappointed knowing I'd never be her.

Like I said, maybe it said somewhere that it was from another region/country when I made my purchase.  I don't remember seeing this written anywhere.  Maybe if it isn't written anywhere this could be an option to let the buyer be aware that the DVD they are about to purchase can only be played in their country.

Although things may not be exactly how you wanted or planned for your life, look around! You will find, if you are insightful enough, that the things you most wanted are there; just in a different way or form.

1953125,4,B0000VD02E,"American author Frances Mayes, was best known for published poetry work and also being the Professor of Creative Writing, director of the Poetry Center and chair of the Department of Creative Writing at San Francisco University.

But in 1996, Frances would release her memoir, ""Under the Tuscan Sun"", based on her experience of purchasing an abandoned villa in rural Cortona in Tuscany, Italy.  The memoir was a success and was number one on the New York Times Best Sellers list for over two years.

The memoir would eventually receive a film adaptation in 2003 courtesy of filmmaker/writer Audrey Wells (""George of the Jungle"", ""Shall We Dance?"", ""The Game Plan"").  And the film would star actress Diane Lane (""The Perfect Storm"", ""Unfaithful"", ""Jumper""), Sandra Oh (""Grey's Anatomy"", ""Sideways"", ""Hard Candy""), Lindsay Duncan (""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"") and Vincent Riotta (""The Dark Knight"", ""Revolver"", ""Heaven""), plus a cameo from one of Italian's legendary filmmakers Mario Monicelli.

Having been released on DVD back in 2003, ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" was released on Blu-ray in July 2012.

VIDEO:

""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  A major positive about ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is the location of where the film is shot in Italy is absolutely beautiful.  Cinematographer Geoffrey Simpson  (""Fried Green Tomatoes"", ""Little Women"", ""Shine"") did a wonderful job of capturing the beauty of Italy through this film.  Colors are vibrant during the outdoor scenes, closeups feature detail on the faces of the talent, black levels are nice and deep and much better clarity of this film on Blu-ray vs. its DVD counterpart.

I detected no artifacts, banding or any problems while viewing this film.  If anything, fans of ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" will enjoy the HD transfer of this film.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French 5.1 and Spanish 2.0 Dolby Digital.  For a romantic comedy, dialogue is crystal clear and while there is some music, the film is primarily dialogue driven coming through the front and center channels.  But the surround channels are used.  Quite effectively during the storm sequence and also for ambiance, especially during scenes with a larger crowd.  Overall, the lossless soundtrack for ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" was good and quite appropriate for a romantic comedy.

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Under the Tuscan Sun"" comes with the following special features:

  Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary with director Audrey Wells.  Wells talks about the film adaptation of ""Under the Tuscan Sun"", working with the talent and crew, shooting in various locations in Italy plus the costume and set design.
  Tuscany 101 Making of Featurette - (9:26) Featuring interviews with filmmaker Audrey Wells, author Frances Mayes and the cast regarding the ""Under the Tuscan Sun"".
  Deleted Scenes - (2:31) Featuring three deleted scenes.

JUDGMENT CALL:

For any adult who has been married and then finding themselves divorced, especially after their 40s, it's a frightening experience.

It's one thing to start over from scratch, when you are younger but when you are older, you just never know what is out there, whether you still have what it takes to get into a new relationship but mostly the fear of starting over.

What I enjoyed about ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is the fact that it's based on the real-life memoir of Frances Mayes and that Diane Keaton would play the character with efficacy.

A romantic comedy shot in a beautiful location, ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is a movie that many divorcees can relate to (ore those who have ended a long relationship with their partner), because these are issues that many people face.  The difference is that not many people get the opportunity to escape to Italy or another country.

So, watching the film, you can't help but laugh and be delighted by the character of Frances Mayes, as she tries to find her way in Italy.  Yes, she is aware about Italian men (and we see many scenes with Italian men trying to get her attention), especially the number of Italian men who are attracted to Frances, but yet are married.  It's a different culture than America but it's quite fascinating to see it all happen in Italy and see how the character of Frances manages to learn about herself through the people she meets and dates.

But there is no doubt that the film is quite irresistible due to its location.  From the beautiful buildings to the local merchants, to seeing Katherine (Lindsay Duncan) being a bit La Dolce Vitta or to see Frances Mayes learning to cook Italian food and preparing it for her Polish workers.  Suffice to say, it's a fun film with plenty of enjoyable supporting actors.

""Grey's Anatomy"" actress Sandra Oh stars alongside then fellow ""Grey's Anatomy"" co-star Kate Walsh as a lesbian couple expecting a baby.  Pawel Szajda as Pawel, the Polish immigrant who has fallen for the Italian Chiara (as portrayed by Giulia Steigerwalt).  Two y0ung people who have fallen in love but whether or not her parents would support their relationship because he is Polish (and has no major job).

The acting performance was well-done but Diane Lane absolutely shined in this film and was delightful to watch in this film!

As for the Blu-ray release, the video quality is an upgrade over the DVD release.  Lossless audio definitely sounds great via the surround channels, may it be the storm sequence or crowd ambiance, ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" looks and sounds great via HD.  As for special features, it's pretty much the same special features on the original DVD - audio commentary, deleted Scenes and a short making-of featurette.

But overall, ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" was a fun romantic comedy.  Granted, there is no major male co-star to go along with Diane Lane, but that's perfectly fine.  This whole film is about a divorcee starting over with her life and learning more about herself and the fact that the world is not going to end.  And no matter how scary life can be at this new chapter in a divorcee's life, you move forward and keep living your life.

If you are a fan of this 2003 film or just wanting a beautiful, delightful romantic comedy on Blu-ray that is not so much focused on a relationship but more about one woman coming off a long relationship and starting over in a foreign country, then definitely give ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" a try!",1354147200,9,6515,4.933884297520661
1953126,4,B0000VD02E,"I'm in love with Diane Lane.  I honestly wish that her career post-Oscar nomination would have been slightly better (or a whole lot better) than what it was, but I'm just happy that she's still working, and she really does bring a lot to what she does.  The year following her Oscar nominated turn in `Unfaithful' (where she should have won in a cakewalk) she put out one of those standard chick-flick type rom-coms that get made every other month.  Basically the `Eat Pray Love' of the 2000's (just far less muddled and unfocused), `Under the Tuscan Sun' is basic and predictable and yet elevated thanks to Lane's dedicated performance that the focus brought to fleshing out the depth in the story.

The film follows Frances, a middle aged married woman who is under the impression that her life is fine until her husband leaves her.  It was sudden and depressing yet she picks up (at the urging of her friends) and moves on, halfway around the world, to Italy.  She buys a villa, that needs a lot of work, and then sets off on an adventure of self-re-discovery as she chases what she thinks she needs and ultimately finds what has been eluding her all along.

If you can get past the idea that this is yet `another one of those movies' you can see the magic in every frame.  Lane is a revelation, delivering a great performance that truly lifts the film to places it couldn't have gone without her.  The cinematography and mere sets alone are spellbinding (having just been to Tuscany I can say that it really is as magical as these films make it look) and the way that the story develops is also quite admirable because it doesn't exactly follow that generic formula (especially when concerning Frances's love interests).

It is well worth a gander, especially if you are a fan of these types of chick-flicks.  It may be nearly ten years old (man, how the time flies) but it still holds up upon recent viewings and is the perfect film for a cozy night in with your significant other and a tall glass of wine.",1354147200,,2011,4.527624309392265

Along the way she makes unexpected friendships, and becomes instrumental in helping others find happiness in love, and she does some excellent food preparations for the workers on the villa.  Very mouth-watering and colorful Italian dishes that look fantastic.  There's comedy, some tragic elements, but in the end there's hope and celebration for life and love in this nicely done movie.

1953155,2,B0000VD02E,"Beautiful scenery, great cinematography, wonderful blu-ray, Diane Lane.  What could go wrong?

I'm a big Diane Lane fan, and I was really looking forward to watching this one, but it fell flat.  It's all about the story and how well it's written.  The story line itself had the potential to make a great movie.  It just wasn't written very well.  Even Diane couldn't rescue the lame dialogue, and usually her presence alone is good enough for me.  It was also completely implausible.  Frances tells her lawyer she has virtually no cash, her husband is requesting alimony, and apparently only receives her share of the equity from the sale of their house in the divorce settlement.  Somehow, though, she has enough money to travel to Europe, purchase a dilapidated, yet elegant country estate in Italy, support herself AND employ a 3 man crew for at least 9 months for the renovation.  C'mon.

If you have a blu-ray player, your time won't be completely wasted by watching this because it really does have a ton of gorgeous scenery, including Diane.  Not much is gained, though, by having the sound turned up.

Too bad.  The potential and the cast was there.  Blame the screenwriter.  I did.",1349654400,,1190,4.788177339901478

1953181,5,B0000VD02E,"There are so many reviews already for this 2003 movie that I didn't think one more was necessary, however, I have read so much unjust criticism of the film with regard to stereotypes and the Italian characters that I thought perhaps a few home facts from an Italian native might be in order (and I will try my hardest not to give away the plot). For a start, the portrayal of the people is very well done, although it certainly shows Italians mostly on their best behaviour, but still very accurate. They are generally helpful, friendly and quick to accept Americans and other foreigners especially if the ""stranieri"" appear to sincerely appreciate a different lifestyle and don't focus entirely on the inefficiencies and shortcomings that go along with it. The scene in the notary's office is a very good example. The deal is done in a competent way but with a good dose of humanity. The people in the street scenes are as authentic as can be, they are Cortona residents and, unsurprisingly, speak with the local accent. The building crew are Polish and that explains their accents.

I was amazed to find so much venom directed at the Marcello character. His behaviour became perfectly understandable if one grasped the fact that months had elapsed between their initial meeting and the later one. The parade of potential builders is obviously meant to be a comic caricature of personalities, but it really doesn't stray too far from the truth. I have met people just like them. In fact, all the characters in the movie are fairly believable, the single exception being Ed, who (even considering his limited role) is completely wooden and exhibits the personality of the proverbial door-knob.

I detest the term ""chick flick"" and this film does not deserve it. I think the story was handled with such a soft, restrained hand that it was misinterpreted as being lightweight, when in fact it dealt undramatically with many human dramas. Not everything has to be guts and gore to be heart-felt. I thought Diane Lane gave a perfectly nuanced performance, her character suffered a great deal and yet she tried to handle the collapse of her marriage and ultimately her entire life in a dignified and adult way. Any sensitive person would feel her distress, no histrionics needed. The many supporting actors also gave warm, masterfully well-judged performances; particularly good, in my opinion, were Vincent Riotta, Lindsay Duncan and Pawel Szajda.

The single failing of the film might be that grasping a random opportunity and rebuilding a happy life out of the ruins of your previous one is too often a dream that does not come true, but I will never complain about an optimistic and uplifting viewpoint. It certainly beats the current fixation with wallowing in the ugliest and vilest possible view of mankind which so-called ""serious"" film makers try to pass off as gritty realism.

The photography is of the highest level, the Tuscan countryside and Positano coastline appear in all their glory (even off-season) and Audrey Wells did a great job of the screenplay and direction, despite the obvious technical challenges of adapting a book to the wide screen and, apparently, a tight budget. And finally, contrary to another common complaint, my OH and I both enjoy watching this beautiful production and do so at regular intervals whenever we need a bit of cheering up and a virtual visit to the Tuscany we know and love.",1347148800,,3422,4.905008635578584

1953184,1,B0000VD02E,"I have to say this is one case where the movie is better than the book, but that bar was set pretty low.  Where the book has barely a plot and nothing of any interest (unless you're a huge HGTV fan), the movie has a slightly more interesting plot by virtue of a protagonist that has just gone through a divorce.  Her home has appreciated significantly (which explains better than the book how she has the wealth to buy a Tuscan villa and renovate it).  Her friends then sign her onto a gay tour of Tuscany, which could have given the movie some depth ...but evidently was scuttled in favor of more conventional fare.  Nothing dooms a film like cowardice.

The rest of the movie is about the woman trying to find a new husband while pretending not to.  In the end, of course (of course!) she succeeds.  This kind of twaddle should embarrass even made-for-TV writers.

In the right hands, this revised storyline could have turned into a perfectly decent movie.  Unfortunately it is saccharine, utterly predictable and fails even to take advantage of Tuscany's exceptional scenery.",1344816000,3,1078,4.691489361702128

The overall movie is just gorgeous on BD, and if you a big fan of the movie, I'd say it's money well spent for the double dip.

1953255,5,B0000VD02E,"This warm, beautiful, and often magical film from Audrey Wells would surely have been an Academy Award darling if made decades ago, as its tone and message, not to mention performances, fit more into the old-style filmmaking of a Hollywood now long gone. Diane Lane is simply marvelous as a woman whose world is turned upside down by divorce. In an attempt to start her life over and recapture the joy in life, she purchases a run down villa in Tuscany. Audrey Wells, who directed and co-produced the film with Tom Sternberg, also adapted Frances Mayes' book, giving this film the heavenly scent of grapes on the vine and the visual beauty of a field of sunflowers on an Italian hillside.

Diane Lane is Frances, suddenly, and quite unexpectedly single again. Wondering how you breathe again when your world is shattered, Lane perfectly captures that stunned feeling of years wasted when a marriage ends. The wind is taken from the San Francisco writer's sails when someone half her age takes her place, which though cliche'd, is often the case. Sandra Oh of Grey's Anatomy fame lends fine support as Frances's friend, Patti, who refers to Frances's new place as 'camp divorce'. Adrift at sea emotionally, Frances has not moved forward despite having enough cash from the settlement to do so. When Patti experiences a similar heartbreak, she offers her friend the ticket to romantic Italy she can no longer use.

Frances feels a change within herself, realizing if she truly is to recover from seeing her world crumble, she must build another one. After a chance meeting with Katherine (Lindsay Duncan), a free-spirited former Fellini actress, Frances jumps in with both feet, purchasing a run-down Italian villa called Bramasole. Vincent Liotta is excellent as the kind and decent realtor, Martini, who will become a true friend to Frances. There is an especially touching scene between the two as Frances realizes she has bought a house for which she doesn't have the life. The humorous elements of fixing up a 300 year old house on the hills of Tuscany are handled well by director Wells, adding great charm to a tender story, juxtaposing the ebb and flow of rebuilding a life and a villa. The happily married Martini has great affection for Frances nonetheless, aiding her by finding a group of Polish builders looking for work.

The workers become part of her family as she refurbishes both her live and her villa. Pawel (Pawel Szajda), the youngest of the workers, falls in love Chira (Giulia Steigerwalt), the daughter of Frances's next door neighbor daughter, prompting Frances to intercede for her new family member with the girl's disapproving family. A simple white dress becomes a poignant image when Frances rediscovers the joy and excitement of new love with Marcello (Raol Bova), only to discover there is pain in learning to live again. That realization is soon confirmed when a devastated and quite pregnant Patti shows up on her doorstep in need of a shoulder. It is Frances's friend Martini who will come to her rescue again, however, opening her eyes to the fact that all her dreams have actually come true, if only she will use her heart to see them.

This wonderful and life-affirming film ends at a wedding reception, proving that unthinkably good things can happen, even late in the game. The warmth and charm on display here is of another era, and was unfortunately scoffed at by many critics. Audrey Wells has made a sweet and ultimately joyful film about the living of life itself. A moist ocean breeze and the flavorful aroma of Italian food as it simmers seem to hang over every frame of celluloid used. Superlative photography from Geoffrey Simpson captures the many colors of Italy, the flag throwing festival where young Pawel tries to win over Chira's parents especially beautiful. Christophe Beck's score seems to fit every mood and situation without intruding upon the scene. Finally, Diane Lane gives a very gentle and old-style performance that fits the tone of this lovely film. Great and wonderful things occur even later in life, and often when we least expect them. That is the lovely message of this film.",1311465600,,4147,4.903133903133903
1953256,5,B0000VD02E,"*spoilers*

This has to be one of my favorite chick flicks I've watched. While most others are completely predictable and hackneyed, this one throws some curve balls in there to make it unique.

Go watch ""Eat Pray Love"" and you'll see the major differences in, what is essentially, the same story. Frances is a much more relatable and likable character who's motivations and fears are fully fleshed out. Both movies suffer from the travel stereotypes, but ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" explores the relationship that Frances develops with her new home. Settling in Italy was a spur of the moment decision in avoidance of going back to a life she hates (rather than making a separate decision to ""find herself"" in another country). Living in this run down house didn't solve her problems, but was a metaphor for her working through the failure of her marriage.

My two absolute favorite parts of this movies is the fact that, unlike every other chick flick in existence, Frances gets everything she wanted out of life, but not in the way she imagined. She tried so hard to make a new romantic interest work to replace what she lost, but she realized that romance was not enough. It isn't until she realizes how wonderful her life really was, despite her lack of romance, that the One enters into the picture. I loved that the One wasn't an integral part of the story, but rather the icing on top of the cake.",1310256000,2,1400,4.659919028340081

What's a woman to do but hop a flight to gorgeous Tuscany with a tour group going there from a fortunate gift? What this beautiful film also includes is a romance of this spectacular city, culture, the absolute beauty of the scenery and delicious food. The most unexpected and courageous thing about this film is that Frances decides to make it her home, after all, this movie is totally about second chances, third chances and onward. She eases her pain by completely changing her own life on her own terms. She wanted a few things for her home in unusual ways, they all come true.

If you love romance, which this film is full of if you also include the parallel romance of Italy itself. Some situations test Frances's resolve as she goes through hard times too. Hearts heal, people heal and move on to much better things when you leave your heart receptive to what comes without forcing it but appreciating what comes along, just as Frances does. An interesting person Frances meets in Tuscany is free spirited Katherine who subtly shows her how to cherishing living differently. Frances is lead to happiness which convinces her that this is what she was destined for all her life; an unhurried, stable and joyful life.

The book didn't turn Italy and her men into stereotypes of hunky, swarthy men. But the movie managed to do that and more, turning every character we came across into a stereotype. Here's a bus filled with gays laughing and being inclusive and friendly, even to the straight girl. Here's a lesbian couple, blissful in their coming parenthood. Here's the pregnant friend now abandoned by aforementioned gay lover who, in what looks like her 10th month of pregnancy, jumps on a plane to show up unannounced at her buddy's Italian villa to have her baby. And live there, as far as we can tell. Here's the beautiful, eccentric actress from a by-gone day spewing out sexual advice while lunching with a group of nuns -- and dressed a bit like a padre? Why not! She's eccentric, don't you know. Missing was the nuts and bolts of how all this happens. How's Frances Mayes (Lane) supporting herself? Where's the money coming from? In the book, Mayes and her lover spent summer's in Italy working the house and land back to life, then running back to SF to teach so they could make more money to do the whole thing again next summer vacation. And the book has a final scene that left me gasping with surprise and delight which the movie was in no way going to recreate, not with  Lane's Mayes sniffing out yet another lover in the movie's last scene. Was that all the movie could aspire to, that Diane Lane find another lover? Talk about shallow.

I'm not so rigid to believe that a movie based on even a favorite book must be loyal to that book. But with any changes, you'd expect the movie to be good in its own way. I'm not sure why this movie bothered calling attention to its connection to Mayes' book. Why not just call it ""Chick finds sex in Italy"" and leave it at that?",1293408000,4,1957,4.3856749311294765

1953337,3,B0000VD02E,"Having read Frances Mayes' travelogue UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN: AT HOME IN ITALY and enjoyed the flow of her reconstructed a shabby old treasure of a house there and her inimitable conversation about how to enjoy the special qualities of Tuscany, seeing this book adapted into a film seemed a reasonable step.  After seeing the film and finding it so completely unrelated to Mayes' book - using it more life a stage on which to create a lot of 'audience pleasing subplots' - this viewer passed on writing a review.  Seeing the film again, years later, without any expectations to meet, was a pleasant surprise.  Get past the Audrey Wells superimposed episodes of Sandra Oh and her baby, of the love affair gone awry, and the Fellini reenactment etc and the film has some charm.  Diane Lane tries her best to make us consider this little story a transformation event and in many cases ti works.  But not always in the manner in which it was intended.

What does come shining through are some bit parts by actors who deserve more attention and more exposure.  For instance, the 'workmen' who help Lane's adapted character transform her villa into a 'home' for all manner of folk.  One of the actors who plays the young Pawel, Pawel Szajda, has all the necessary qualities to bloom into a fine career - and hopefully this film will be a springboard for him.  Also Lane's 'at the end of the film only' lover Ed is played by another solid newcomer - David Sutcliff.  Otherwise the possibility of falling in love with beautiful Tuscany is a bit blurred with all the generated little stories that add little to the film.  But then again, it IS durable - which says a lot for the many love affairs with Italy that both the book and the film started! Grady Harp, July 10",1278979200,,1757,4.563694267515924

1953339,5,B0000VD02E,"I've said with regard to other movies that it is vital to be able to accept the basic assumptions of the movie; If you can accept the basic assumptions of this movie you're in for a fun ride. Just feel the movie and enjoy the scenery; a man can do that too if he is willing.

The movie picks up on an all too common theme, what to do with oneself after a divorce; this is the story of Frances and how she handles that challenge. In some regards the movie reminds me of ""A Year in Provence,"" the renovation of the old house, the gradual making of new friends, and the language challenge are major themes in both movies. In both of these movies the frustrations, challenges, and opportunities result in a happy, fulfilled ending that leave you feeling good about things. That's not bad!

Frances is a sympathetic character to me and I found myself rooting for her to make a go of it; Diane Lane does a compelling job of playing the part of a vulnerable, yet determined woman with lots of inner strength.

As a guy, I too like the action and adventure movies, but, thanks to my wife, have had the opportunity to discover that I can also enjoy some of the more romantic and gentler movies.

In summary, if you can let yourself be charmed by an attractive and sympathetic woman trying to live her life, beautiful scenery, interesting supporting characters, and a happy ending I think you'll enjoy this movie.

The first time I saw this film, I found it to be a somewhat mediocre mid-life crisis story (which I can't really appreciate, being only 25). Now, though, it's one of my all-time favorite films.

Most of this is owed to Diane Lane and the stunning scenery of Italy, which seems itself a character in the film. There's something extraordinary about watching a person overcome her own total destruction, as Frances does. Furthermore, while I generally hate ""journey of self-discovery"" movies, this one works simply because it recognizes two truths: no one can love you if you can't love yourself, and loving others is the expression of that self-love. When Frances is selfish, it doesn't work out. When she's giving, all her dreams come true. Cheesy, maybe, but fantastic.

The music is excellent, and the pacing highly appropriate. Finally, on a more shallow note, there are a lot of hot men in this movie. Pawel in particular is well worth at least one viewing of the movie for the ladies!",1266105600,,1171,4.7073170731707314

These films all have one thing in common: the protagonists find themselves in situations where life hasn't turned out the way they planned, or a major ""life event"" takes something away from them, and in their own moment of lack and the inevitable pull toward self-pity, they find that the less they focus on what they lack and more on the blessings they have (usually in the form of other people in their lives), the more the their needs are met...and often on a grander scale than they'd previously imagined.

In short, some times you lay down and get up to find yourself covered with ladybugs. People who have seen the film will get that reference immediately.

There are a number of reasons to watch the movie, beginning with Diane Lane. She manages to bring the viewer right up to the point where they might be turned off by the whining and self-pity, and theby stop ""rooting for"" her...but she never crosses that line. She keeps her character human, and part of being human is feeling loss and disappointment. What separates the people who stay in that frame of mind from the ones who eventually prosper is a willingness to get up and keep moving, even when ""life hurts"" and you'd rather not.

That's what the movie is all about. In the beginning, following her divorce, her friend Patti (the amazing Sandra Oh) tries to convince her to take a trip to Tuscany. She decides she can't, and relocates the pity party to a cramped, noisy apartment. Fortunately, she lacks a tolerance for her new environment and it's off to Tuscany we go.

From that point on, there are too many spoilers, so I'll stop here. My feeling is that there are probably more people who have seen the movie and are reading the reviews to see what others think than there are people deciding if they want to watch it.

In the modern, cynical world, there is a certain amount of scorn directed toward these little ""fables"" and ""life lessons."" However, taking a moment to watch them reminds us that we are all human, we are all fragile, and we all can make a simple decision to do the best we can with what we have, and to always give thanks for what we've got.",1253923200,2,3066,5.956818181818182

As a recent divorcee, she is sad and struggling to find herself and figure out what she wants out of life.  The bursts of sadness and loneliness she experiences throughout the movie are heartening and lend credence to her plight-she is a middle-aged woman, who has lost her home and has been tossed aside by her uncaring husband - and she is clearly not going to get over it just because she has moved to a (soon to be) fabulous villa in Tuscany.

I was not to be disappointed in being disappointed. Darkness couldn't come fast enough ""Under the Tuscan Sun.""

Diane Lane gets the unpleasant surprise of her life about her husband at a cocktail party. Her friends decide she needs to get away and send her to Italy for a little R & R. She notices a villa for sale and the old lady homeowner who is ambivalent about selling it to a wealthy German couple. Suddenly a pigeon discharges its plop on Diane's head. With such a tender and wonderful sign from above, the old lady decides to sell her home to her (presumably right after she washes her hair).

So starts her new adventure.

She has the usual run-of-the-mill problems with the house, and one of the friends who sent her on the trip in the first place, shows up pregnant. She helps a local through her love affair with a Polish construction worker, and has an affair where she cheers herself: ""I still got it."" (With Diane Lane that's a real tough one to believe)! But after hearing that line, you might be asking yourself: ""Did somebody actually get paid for writing this?""

In the end, she finds her true love, a character who never develops because we see him inside the home through a window, and only at the end. (That way, Mr. Right doesn't even have to be listed in the credits).

1953500,5,B0000VD02E,"""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is a rare commodity in films today- a thoughtful, mature, and elegant romantic comedy which is tastefully written and exquisitely performed.  The profusion of obscenities and graphic sexual exploits found in most recent ""comedies"" thankfully are absent in this splendid movie.

This movie is rich with gentle humor and accurate insight into the human condition.  We have all experienced joy and sadness, loneliness, and the yearning to be loved and accepted by others.  The central character, played by Diane Lane, is an intelligent and attractive thirtyish writer who has suffered a heartbreaking divorce.  She decides to make a fresh start and relocates from the U.S. to the lush countryside of Tuscan, Italy.  She buys a dilapidated villa and plans to have it renovated as her new home.

As the villa is transformed by a construction crew of rather eccentric Polish immigrants, Lane's character also undergoes changes. She becomes more of a risk-taker and forces herself out of her comfort zone so she can meet and mingle with the locals while absorbing their language and customs along the way.  She learns more about herself in the process.

Our heroine's spirits get a major boost when her best friend (drolly represented by Sandra Oh) comes to live with her in the villa.  The best friend is pregnant, and she has been deserted by her female lover.  Lane's character and Oh's character find strength and comfort from their long friendship.  They understand each other even if nothing has been said.  They have a special bond.

There are so many delights in ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" not the least of which is the bright ensemble of actors with Diane Lane's textured, sympathetic performance especially memorable.  She makes you really care about this decent and kind wounded soul who is trying so hard to move on with her life after the trauma of divorce from a seemingly happy marriage.

Too many movies today are mindless, exploitative trash.  A movie like ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is a reminder that there are a few talented, conscientious artists still around who are able to create movies that are intelligent and have a heart.  We should celebrate and encourage these artists.  Audiences have been deprived long enough.",1198972800,2,2250,5.0

The directing, acting, filming, scenery and music were perfect.  Audrey Wells (Best Director),Diane Lane (best actress), Lindsay Duncan (best supporting actress) and Christophe Beck (musical score) should have all received oscars.  I spent most of my brief time in Italy, Under the Tuscan  Sun, and it was a life-changing experience. I have always heard how  beautiful Italy was; and the scenery & landscapes in the Italian-themed movies I've watched seemed almost too good to be true.  But once  I stood on Italian soil, mingled with the wonderful people, devoured the food and wine (& GELATO!) and tossed euros in the Trevi Fountain (yes, I made my wish!), I now realize what a treasure Italy is: The mediterranean blue, Italian terracotta, pristine green and violet & crimson sunset make one want to hop on a plane to Rome.  Italy is truly Heaven on Earth and the Food is Divine. I felt blessed to be a part of Italy for a brief time and anxiously look forward to returning one day to my possible future home.

Though the movie diverges quite widely from the book, Mayes herself says it captures her book's spirit, so that's good enough for me.  There are some complaints here on these review pages about this being a 'formulaic chick flick,' but it's subversively anything but.  Director Wells correctly points out in the 'Making Of' featurette that at the very moment in the chick flick formula where the love interest is supposed to appear (approx. 30 minutes in), we get a head fake...in fact, we get two of them & a true love interest appears only as an afterthought.  Instead, Wells keeps the focus on Lane's character's efforts to establish a household and fill it with love.  It's left to Raoul Bova (outstanding as Real Estate agent Marcello) to point out that Frances has done just that, right under her own nose.  It's a superb moment.

As an added bonus, it's a hoot for anyone who's watched ""Grey's Anatomy"" to see Sandra Oh and Kate Walsh here together...as a couple no less.",1195862400,2,1105,4.877005347593583

These movies are always filled with contrivances, stereotypes and obvious metaphors and this movie is no exception.  But it was able to somehow make it all very natural and sweet.

Sure, its pretty to look at, but ultimately the pretty scenery wears thin and your intelligence gets offended at every turn in the 'story'. In the alternate universe that this movie takes place in, there's no such thing as a visa, and piles of beautifully cooked food just pops into being. Vast quantities of it, too. And there's no need to work for money, just renovate a villa for free, and then spend your days swanning around in it. That's how you find true happiness.

Obviously, this movie was made for Americans who will never leave the United States. Anyone who has travelled to another country knows the rigors of travel, and the difficulty involved in getting a visa for some countries, let alone a residency visa. I mean, you can't just be on a bus tour of another country, see a house for sale that you like, then buy it and live there forever. And then invite your friends from your country to come over and live there as well. The real world doesn't work like that!!!

And lastly - it doesn't matter how fast you drive, there's NO WAY you can get from Tuscany to Positano in and hour! It takes nearly an hour to get from Naples to Positano, the road is so narrow and winding.

1953562,5,B0000VD02E,"Thousands of years ago, long before the Romans came on the scene, Italy was under the hegemony of a people known as the Etruscans.  Eventually they were conquered by the Romans and were absorbed into the Roman Empire.  Today, there is but one place in Rome which gives a hint to their existence:  Tuscany.

Today, we have the pleasure of having none other than Diane Lane as our tour guide of the verdant countryside of Tuscany.  Ms. Lane potrays a woman who is recovering from a devastating divorce.  While on an Italian tour she impulsively buys a run-down Italian villa that is out in the country.  The story depicts the interesting parallel of her attempts to fix up the house as symbolic of her efforts to put her life back together after having to endure the emotional wrecking ball of a nasty, mean-spirited divorce.

If I were to describe Diane Lane in one word, it would be likeable.  Yes, she is gorgeous and she has a smokin' hot body.  However, just one word would be likeable.  She is the type of person we'd all relish to have as our next-door neighbor - for reasons that extend WELL beyond her physical appearance.  She is likeable even when she plays characters that are not-so-likeable, as she did in the movie UNFAITHFUL.

Some would categorize this movie as a Romantic Comedy.  I'm not so sure I would.  Yes, there are some comical scenes in it, but I would lean a little more towards calling it a drama due to the depth of character development.

In summary, I would basically recommend this movie to 3 demographics of persons:  Italians, non-Italians and everyone else.  Now, go out & enjoy Tuscany with Diane Lane!!",1172966400,8,1637,4.625

That's because -- like most Diane Lane parts -- you need to let yourself feel and grow with the main character. Personally, I fell in love with many of the characters and boy, do I want that house she renovated!

1953588,2,B0000VD02E,"I bought this movie hoping to see some Tuscan scenery and because I like Diane Lane.

There are few views of Italy and they are very brief.  In fact, the whole movie is a series of glimpses.  A birth scene lasting ten seconds.  A sketchy sex scene between two people who just met and don't show any signs of connecting. Glimpses of renovating the house.  There is no story as such.  The idea that she finds herself is totally unconvincing.

The relationships are nil, except between the young boy and girl.  Frances and her Chinese friend are constantly telling each other how much they like each other and that they are best friends, but we never see any other interaction between them except that.  They have a half-dozen scenes at least and this is what they say every time!

The reason God created stories was so that relationships could develop and become convincing.  By avoiding any continuous development and giving us a choppy, episodic smattering of this and that, this movie fails as travelogue, as love story, as friendship story, as personal development story.

Contrast this movie with ""My House in Umbria"" to see what I mean.  The people in that movie connect with each other.  And they have character.  None of these people are characters, except the aging film star.  And the scenery is a presence in that movie, and is almost an actor in the movie in its effect on the people.

I think the appeal of Under the Tuscan Sun is in its theme: You can do anything you want without forethought, let the chips fall where they may, and it will all work out fine.  This message is repeated explicitly several times throughout the film and is indeed illustrated repeatedly by the film itself.  You can even do nothing and next thing you know, you'll be crawling with ladybugs (a symbol of good luck).  This legitimation of irresponsibility must have enormous appeal for a lot of people.",1167868800,,1893,4.661631419939577

1953594,3,B0000VD02E,"What I liked about this film was the theme of self-discovery and this wounded woman making time for herself.  Also, you cannot totally dis a film with the achingly handsome Raoul (forget his last name, but he played Marcello.)  I am a chick-flick loving female and he was just gorgeous, even when he was dumping her.

However, some elements were too obvious.  She's closed off emotionally and sexually, and can't find the snake that's just entered her house.  Gee, what must the SNAKE symbolize?  Oh, and just before she physically hooks up with the scrumptious Marcello, whom she has just met, a KITTEN appears.  There's some nasty-word foreboding going on!

I don't care how hurt you are.  It never makes good sense to drive an hour with a man whom you just met in a foreign country.  I can suspend disbelief, but that was just foolish, even in a chick flick.

Additionally, the animation sequence of the sun setting and rising during the kiss was jarring.  Same for the strange movement when she gazed into the old picture.

I did enjoy Sandra Oh's performance, and even the sterotyped eccentric Lindsey Duncan had her moments. But the sum of the parts do not make a whole.  It's worth renting, but not buying.

I was most disappointed with the dependent-victim theme.  Frances loses her life, finds hunky lover, loses hunky lover and begins to realize that perhaps the world revolves around more than her having a man.  MAYBE her happiness can spring from inside, as in that of emotionally healthy people.  This point would have been a great stopping point.  But, no, we have to bring the young, handsome failed writer to rescue her psyche and self-esteem, and prove that she will not be happy until Prince Charming seeks her out.

1953595,3,B0000VD02E,"(3.5 stars) Based on the captivating memoir of author Frances Mayes, this fictionalized version of her story becomes a completely different creation--far more romantic, more predictable, and more obvious than the memoir.  Here in the film, Frances, recovering from a devastating divorce, accepts a ten-day trip to Tuscany from two friends, leaves the tour group, and discovers and buys an abandoned villa.  With her own imagination and the help of an inexperienced Polish crew, which has the predictable number of construction disasters, she renovates the old villa, always hoping that some day there will be a wedding, preferably her own to the perfect man, and a family to give life to the old place.

The scenery is beautiful (of course), the vistas are endless and well-photographed, and the challenges of making the old house both livable and comfortable are never-ending.  Walls falling down, a violent thunderstorm, a visiting owl, and unlimited problems with the plumbing keep the humor visual and the viewer amused.  Frances's affair and the unexpected arrival of a pregnant friend from home add intrigue and keep the complications coming.  A secondary Romeo-and-Juliet plot involving the teenaged daughter of one of her neighbors and the Polish teenager working on Frances's house, add ""depth"" to Frances's own search for romantic happiness.  Ultimately, the film ends as the viewer expects it will--romantically satisfying.

The subtlety of the book, with its lovely descriptions of the countryside and its people and its sense of reality, are sacrificed here in favor of visual excitement, humor, and ongoing love stories, and Frances's (real) self-discovery becomes trite moralizing in the film, as seen in the quotation that begins this review.  Diane Lane is charming as Frances, but she, nevertheless, looks older than the young men to whom she seems to be attracted, and the gay subplot involving her friends and the tour which brings her to Tuscany are extraneous (but politically correct).  Highly romantic and fun to watch, this film is a disappointingly Hollywood-ized version of a thoughtful and charming memoir. n Mary Whipple",1160179200,9,2149,5.312684365781711
1953596,1,B0000VD02E,"Bottom Line: If you loved or even liked the book, this movie will most likely be a great disappointment to you!  As another reviewer rightly assessed, obviously the screenwriter could not make enough of the book as it stood (no fault of the book) and therefore made liberal changes of great magnitude to the point where the two have little more in common than a villa in Tuscany.  The film does not capture the spirit of the book, which is that Frances and her best friend Ed are so comfortable in their mutual love and lives together that their joie de vivre naturally extends to the villa, transforming it from a shambles to a beautiful piece of antiquity, as well as to their new surroundings in Italy (the town and people of Cortona).  To their great joy and surprise, Italy embraces them as well.  The book has nothing to do with the Diane Lane character, who spends most of the film looking for love in the wrong places (or crying over love lost due to poor choices), while restoration of the villa and discovery of her new surroundings become a dim backdrop to her own shallow escapades and the problems of her girlfriend (both figments of the screenwriter's imagination).

This film could easily have evolved into an Italian Travelog with actors or succumbed to the facile ending, but instead it moved in unexpected directions everytime you seemed to know what would happen next. It really captures the joy and spirit of the Italian people without actually making that a focal point.  The handling of the people and the locale were excellent because they never became the actual point of the movie. However, it is the ending that really sets this film apart, because the film builds to the conclusion that you should be careful what you wish for because you just might get it.  And as usual when you get what you asked for God has a way of providing it in unexpected ways.  I thought this was a subtle and entertaining film.

1953627,4,B0000VD02E,"With stunning scenery and a cute plot, what more could you want in a movie?

Frances (a writer) finds out that her husband has been cheating on her, and after the depressing divorce in which she had to give away her house, she ends up going to Italy because her best friend is pregnant and can't keep the ticket anymore.  She falls in love with the place and impulsively decides to try her luck living there after spoting a dilapidated looking villa in a small town called Cortona.  She thinks she can fix it up herself, but in the end hires a handyman to help out.  She starts to enjoy life again and meets a handsome local guy called Marcello.

While I really liked this movie, I didn't love it.  It does drag a little, but overall, it's sweet, charming, romantic and absolutely visually stunning.  It really makes me want to go and visit this part of Italy.  Sandra Oh has a good role in this (and her lover is played by her Grey's castmate, Kate Walsh).  It is good, and I hope you'll like it.

The redeeming feature of this predictability is the smart writing and the intelligent acting. Diane Lane, as Frances, projects a wide rage of subtle and even conflicting emotions, Lane is what made the movie not only bearable, but even enjoyable.

Some people love amusement parks and love riding roller coasters. The fun is not the similarity of the ride -- it goes up; it goes down; it goes back to where it started from -- but in appreciating the craft and subtle variations that go into each coaster. ""Tuscan Sun"" is like that. You pretty much know that all will be well, but you can appreciate the wonderful artistry it took to make it.

1953633,2,B0000VD02E,"I am the ideal demographic for a chick flick. ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is an insult to the international sisterhood of chick flick fans.

The only way the filmmakers could have made this movie more stupid, more saccharine, more pandering to the lowest common denominator, is if they including a heartwarming, tearjerking, ""Terms of Endearment"" style death by beautiful movie disease.

The Studly Hunk who falls into the Over-Forty Heroine's lap is just so ... airbrushed into unreality. How could anyone be turned on by a man who bears no relation to reality? Don't answer that. I don't want to know. Anyway, this is supposed to be a chick flick, not Sci Fi.

The lead is a woman wounded by her ex-husband, lost chances, and the spectre of a wintry future. Diane Lane has a body a 20 year old would envy. She lacks gravitas. I couldn't feel for her plight. It's just not there on the ravaged face, the drooping body; she's too aerobicized and perky.

""Tuscan Sun"" is as cluttered with gizmos girls are supposed to gush over as a Barbie doll house. There are swooning, adorable Polaks, goofy young lovers, a pregnant lesbian best friend.

There are close-ups of yummy Italian food and unbelievably adorable people having big dinner parties. Everyone is adorable. Even grandma, with her internet love affair with a minor. It's so cute you really wish that at least one of the characters were serial killer.

Everyone has tons of money and can fly between San Francisco to Italy without a moment's care. Frances, the lead character, lives a life completely divorced from normal monetary concerns. This sounds like a fantasy but it comes across as creepy. ""Does this woman ever work? Does money mean anything to her?"" These questions become so annoying, and distasteful, that you are taken out of the movie.

For a movie that got similar themes very right, check out David Lean's 1955 ""Summertime,"" starring Katharine Hepburn and Rosano Brazzi. You love their onscreen romance, but you see that she is imperfect, and he is, too. ""Summertime"" is just as visually beautiful as ""Tuscan Sun,"" but it provides an artistic experience that ""Tuscan Sun"" can't even aspire to.

I didn't much like this movie but I did like the actor playing Martini, the realtor who helped Diane Lane with so many things, including -- paging Dr. Freud -- a snake she could not find in her bedroom.

There was a real chemistry between the two. He wasn't the most handsome man in the movie, or the most sexually dynamic, but he was the one, I think, that most viewers probably wanted to see her end up with.

He was married. But this is a movie. You have two characters with such great chemistry; you could make his wife a harridan, or a lesbian -- not enough Italian lesbian movie characters out there -- or maybe she received a vocation from God and entered a convent. One that doesn't allow husbands.",1151539200,5,2869,4.72
1953634,4,B0000VD02E,"This film was a very pleasant surprise. I picked it out as a movie for my girlfriend and I to watch, since I had heard good things about it several years ago. This IS a chick-flick type of movie, but it definitely does not follow the same VERY tired romantic-comedy formula script that Hollywood loves to crank out. Yes, I suppose Under The Tuscan Sun is a romantic comedy, but it is a GOOD one, and it is  fairly original in its approach.
  First, I should say the beautiful Diane Lane is a really great actress, and plays her part perfectly here. You truly believe in her character, which really adds to the believability of the film (suspension of disbelief is important to enjoying a movie). Most of the supporting cast does an excellent job as well (with the slight exception of ""Stone Face"" Sandra Oh, her face always seems devoid of emotion to me). Probably the most important member of the supporting cast is the SCENERY. The landscapes showcased in this movie are gorgeous and pretty astonishing. The excellent cinematography takes full advantage of the beautiful scenery Italy provides, and the movie is all the better for it.
  While the film is not outright original per se, it does take a rather fresh approach to romantic comedy, and you won't be able to predict what is going to happen far in advance (when's the last time you could say that about a romantic comedy??). The script is very good, with quite a few laughs and excellent pacing, and the dialogue is sharp. All in all, a VERY GOOD movie that both men and women can enjoy.
  A couple of other things: apparently, the film radically departs from the novel. I didn't read the book (and have no intention of doing so). You won't need to read the book to enjoy this movie. Also, I read a few gripes about Diane Lane not being 'beautiful' because she is 'old'. A matter of opinion I guess, but to me she looks fantastic in this movie at 38... and  she really IS a great actress.
  Under The Tuscan Sun is RECOMMENDED for anyone looking for a 'couples' movie that both will enjoy (but Macho He-Men shouldn't bother, you only like Rambo type movies).",1147737600,26,2118,4.535433070866142

However, if you prefer something of the action genre, it's not for you.  I enjoyed very much.  Something I noticed that dissuaded me from thinking it was perfect was their overuse of symbolism.  Here's a list I've comprised of all the things they'd used to represent several miniature stories within the movie (which, in my opinion are a little too abundant):

1. Looking for ladybugs, falling asleep, and finding them on you when you woke up

2. The train making it through the mountains in the end

3. The whole issue with the faucet not working until the end

4. Frances wishing for the wedding and family and then at the end, someone ELSE gets married, and her friend has a baby (the family), and she says, ""You're right, I got everything I wanted.""

5. The elderly man finally acknowledging her.

6. Finding her dream man.

All of these things were left open-ended right from the get-go and everything was concluded in maybe the last two minutes.  If perhaps they had stuck with maybe one or two of the powerful symbols, I think the movie would have over-all had a more powerful impact.",1134172800,6,1219,4.592592592592593
1953682,3,B0000VD02E,"Ghastly chick flic riddled with clichs. Like Oscar Wilde's comment about Dickens, ""One would have to have a heart of stone to read the death of Little Nell without laughing."" The endless assault to the senses of repetitive themes of a woman scorned and a new life blossoming kept me between the Scylla and Charybdis of vomiting and hysterics. When we watched it, my wife repeatedly hit me over the head with her ""Elle"" magazine.

Yet, this film has broad appeal for those middle aged men like me who've loved Diane Lane since ""A Little Romance,"" and like the outdoors and travel. The shots of Tuscany and the coast are beautiful, and the house around which most of the action takes place is gorgeous, and so of those chick flics for which we occasionally are obliged to sit through with our amante, this one is the least offensive.

The first clich: Frances Mayes (Diane Lane) has a perfect balanced life, with a wonderful happy home, all suddenly shattered by that snake-in-the-pants husband. Of course, the divorce settlement is all in *his* favor (""isn't that always the way, girl!?"").

Next clich: a gaggle of sympathetic but ultimately feckless friends with shadows of divided loyalties. Of course, the most sympathetic one is gay (you go, girlfriend!).

I won't belabor the ""change of scene"" clich, since, like ""The Simpson's"" Millhouse, by this time I wanted to scream ""when are we going to get to the fireworks factory?"" off to Tuscany: on a crummy bus!

Next, an impulsive irrational decision (you go girl!) to buy a ruin of a house, not possibly made from a hormone imbalance or deeply unresolved issues without adequate coping mechanisms. No. This is feminine intuition at work. (Girl power!)

In the town nearby, Frances meets Katherine (Lindsay Duncan), a `free spirited"" English woman (or mad lithium deprived manic depressive?) in her early 60s, who has erected her life as a cartoon of herself in devotion to an encounter in her youth with Fellini. It isn't tragic that she's done nothing with her life after building it on the shallow sands of glance with pseudo-intellectual ""greatness,"" it is s*i*g*n*i*f*i*c*a*n*t. Most of her dialogue consists of Katherine tediously lecturing Frances about sex, of which Frances improbably manages to get plenty of boy-toy supply, albeit short-lived (""snake in the pants men again! Boooo Hisssssss!""). One wonders why director Audrey Wells didn't cast the corpse of Ruth Gordon in this part. For the rest of the film I kept looking around for Bud Cort to drive up to the house in his hearse Jaguar to conclude the subplot by giving Katherine a good ""free spirited"" rogering and a happily ever after.

Then there is the ironic cupid clich: Frances's own love life (for which the house serves as metaphor) is being reconstructed from a ruin, yet she must play both Cupid and Hera to a younger couple. Yet the voice of Zelda comes in here too, ""Rich girls don't marry poor boys"" and Juliet is the daughter of forbidding Italian papa, and Romeo is a Polish blue collar dolt without family or purse.

Did we keep getting beaten over the head with how important ""family"" is in the new place Frances has impulsively settled? We all know single-women without family end up mad (like Katherine). Angry, Juno (Frances) seeks a magic flower that is suppose to allow fertilization without a man (or embarks on a series of disastrous affairs). Finding the rare flower (her home, Bramasole) Juno (Frances) uses it to become pregnant and gives birth to Mars (additional subplot conflicts, including her own).

And so, ""Family"" finally does resolves the plot, and Frances (Juno) hosts the wedding of our young lovers at her now restored home (Olympus). Our hero enters stage left (right). He has come from afar to pay homage (worship) the fair Frances (""I heard the great writer I admire....""), whom he has venerated from afar at strange temples (grad school).

And here is our ending: The cast aside Juno has been through hell, is given new transformation as Proserpina, and at the shadow of her lover rises from the flower'd bower and becomes Venus once again, beautiful, loved, and admired for her mind and body and soul. The curtain falls, and the perfect female illusion of a perfect man without flaws living together in a golden flower strewn paradise of long mornings and playful equality (no, not really equal, he worships her *intellectual* superiority), is once again given arc and confirmation.

The end.

1953683,3,B0000VD02E,"This was not the most profound movie in the world. Diane Lane is beautiful and engaging. Sandro Oh's character is beautiful and funny. The male characters, except for the real estate agent, are not developed at all. The plot's premise revolves around a story someone told her. They (the governments of Italy and Austria?) built a railroad between Venice and Vienna through the Alps before they had a train that could make the trip. The point is that you have to have faith that every thing works out for those who make bizarre decisions. Diane Lane's character buys a house and builds a home in Tuscani, because after her divorce, she wants to rebuild her life. She wants a wedding at her home, a family to live at her house, etc. I agree. There is not much to the plot, but that's okay sometimes.

One of the good features of the movie is the scenery. The town and the country side are stunning. Despite the plot, there are some touching moments. There is some humor. The bad features are that many of the characters are sterotypes and do not really live. Some of the characters' decisions make me scratch my head sometimes. Diane Lane's character is an author, but we never see her working on a book. She never seems to run out of money. She budgeted her money somewhat carefully when she bought the house and she had to have gone over her budget when she rebuilt the house and did some major landscaping.

I'm in the Navy and I've lived in Europe for 5 years, 3 of which were in Italy. I've been to Tuscany several times and can tell you this movie is very authentic in what it portrays.  The friendliness of the locals and all.  I didn't care for the story MUCH although it is a very happy movie out of a sad time in a woman's life. Diane Lane was absolutely gorgeous in this movie, even to an 18 yr old.  All in all, it's got comedy, heartbreak, romance, recommended to anyone.",1121731200,,586,4.15929203539823
1953736,4,B0000VD02E,"Under the Tuscan Sun provided the viewer (me!) pure entertainment and a couple hours away from the ""everyday"" of my life.  I enjoyed the film immensely, not only for the beautiful cinematography present in every frame - but to also watch a woman that has been crushed by a divorce she clearly didn't see coming (who are we to judge?), rebound and find joy again in the very little things we hurried souls take for granted in life.

I viewed the film with an open mind, not expecting earth-shattering epiphanies to appear for the viewer over every word of dialogue. I have watched Diane Lane in movies as her career has progressed, and applaud her for jumping in with both feet to portray this beautiful - and after the divorce fragile, and yet ultimately showing a woman's great strength as she regains her confidence and realizes those things she has wished for HAVE come to her, albeit subtly.

I've never cared for critics, and would have missed out on many a great film if I had listened to them.  Yes, this film is a ""chick-flick"" to those I see that have reviewed it, but..........who cares and why does it matter?  If you are looking for a film to watch on a lazy Saturday/Sunday afternoon (after church, of course!) that is beautifully shot, heartfelt, sensitive, romantic and uplifting all rolled into one, Under the Tuscan Sun will surely ""fit the bill"".

1953737,4,B0000VD02E,"Not having read the infamous book upon which this film is based, I have no parallels from which to draw (i.e., novel to movie script). But I can rate this movie based on what I saw and how it affected me.

Diane Lane's performance was fine. She's an attractive lady who plays a jilted novelist trying to escape a failed marriage by retreating to the Tuscany beauty in Italy. The filming is absolutely breathtaking. The colorful little Italian villas, the flowering sunflowers and olive trees. The ancient artifices along the Italian coastal villages. Beautiful.

The story (again, I haven't read the book) was sound, too: a woman trying to rebuild her life by buying and rebuilding a home in Tuscany. She finds out that everything she needs, everything she's hoped for, comes true thanks to this little home and her healing spirit.

So many people have given this film a ""poor"" rating, and I've noticed that most of them have been fans of the novel. But if you haven't read the novel, and want to see some excellent cinematography and a good story, pick up this movie and enjoy. You won't be disappointed.",1120348800,,1105,4.715025906735751
1953738,3,B0000VD02E,"The one thing everyone must say about Audrey Wells' ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is that it is visually stunning.  Restraint is completely abandoned in this Oprah-ready tale of a beautiful divorcee (Diane Lane) ""finding herself"" in the postcard-perfect Tuscan hillside.  Yes, this is a movie for those who sprinkle extra sugar on their cotton candy.

This is the kind of movie that won't give you a gorgeous shot of an old church -- rather, we'll give you a gorgeous shot of an old church on a picturesque Tuscan hillside as the camera peeks over a bank of photogenic sunflowers in full bloom.  Not content to show the gorgeous Diane Lane exchanging sweet nothings with a gorgeous Italian hunk on a gorgeous Italian beach, Ms. Wells feels obliged to throw a kitten -- yes, a freaking kitten -- into the scene for no reason other than to send the cuteness scale over the top.

Ms. Lane stars in this ode to returning to basics - it is revealing that noboby I've talked to about the movie knows her character's name.  In a plot device straight out of a gripe session on ""The View,"" Ms. Lane gets divorced by her philandering husband -- and thanks to California's heartless divorce laws, she ends up living in the divorcee's flat while he keeps the posh San Francisco house.  Massive depression ensues, as evidenced by Ms. Lane's furrowed brow.  Let's just say that the stellar acting job Diane Lane gave us in ""Unfaithful"" is nowhere to be found in ""Tuscan Sun.""

Ms. Lane's stereotypically supportive lipstick lesbian friends try to buck up her spirits by sending her on a trip to Tuscany -- but it's a gay trip, get it!  Actually, the gay tour offers one of the movie's few genuine laughs with its appellation, ""Gay and Away!""  Diane spots a ""for sale"" sign on a picturesque Tuscan villa and, after some hapless negotiating and some timely bird crap, she buys it.

We then enter a long series of scenes as Diane begins to restore the villa -- for those of you who were perhaps wondering if there would be a delightful parallel between the rehabilitation of the villa and Ms. Lane's personal rehabilitation, you won't be surprised.  Again, the movie ain't subtle.  Employing a trio of lovable Polish cardboard cutouts as laborers, Diane returns ""Bramasole"" to its villa-ish glory.  Naturally, after living in Tuscany for a few weeks, Ms. Lane discovers that she has already mastered Tuscan cuisine, and the movie gives us several shots of her presenting her friends and laborers with meals that could be on the cover of a Tuscan cookbook.  Unfortunately, ""Tuscan Sun"" is not that interested in food beyond its photogenics -- those looking for another ""Big Night"" will be horribly disappointed.

Of course, Ms. Lane must find her self romantically involved.  To say this aspect of the story is handled poorly is an understatement. Her realtor achieves a cinematic first -- he offers to sleep with Diane while simultaneously confirming his devotion to his wife.  And just about when the audience is expecting Diane to find herself a man, lo and behold she runs into a charming soul who looks like a champion Italian tennis player.

Several other sub-plots are handled in similarly skin-deep fashion.  This is the kind of movie that doesn't interject a serious love interest for Ms. Lane until the last five minutes, and he really only gets about two or three lines of dialogue . . . but visually the movie tells you that he is the one to complete our heroine.

All in all, ""Tuscan Sun"" is an inoffensive, light-hearted, beautiful romp through nonsense.  To borrow a Shakespearean title, ""Much Ado About Nothing"" completely fits.  That being said, the movie can play a role if you find yourself completely depressed (or lacking in travel plans) -- Tuscany is a wonderful tonic.  At least the movie got that right, if nothing else.

The DVD has virtually no extras to recommend it.",1119830400,5,3870,4.764617691154423
1953739,4,B0000VD02E,"Diane Lane delivers a warm performance as Frances, a writer/book reviewer, who finds purpose in the Tuscan countryside.  Frances, suffering from the depression of a failed marriage, is urged by her pregnant friend Patti (Sandra Oh) to take her place on a tour of Italy.  While at first reluctant, Frances finally accepts Patti's offer when the reality of her life in New York becomes too painful.  Frances is almost immediately charmed by life in Tuscany and on impulse buys a run-down villa that she plans to restore into her personal haven.  Frances, now reborn as Francesca, is hardly alone in her new country as she is befriended by her real estate agent, the mysterious over-the-top blonde woman, her crew of Polish workers, and other townspeople.  But sadness still tugs at her.  Only when events turn out not as she expected does she begin to accept life on its terms and not on her own.

The script and direction (by Audrey Wells) give this film the pacing of an art film, where the subtle interactions and plot cannot be described as much as sensed; however, the feel-good ending has the tacked on feel of a romantic comedy, where the heroine gets what she wants, even though the comedy itself is more smile- than laugh-inducing.  To the credit of the screenwriters, events don't unfold exactly the way one would expect. For instance, the old man who delivers flowers every day to a roadside shrine is never explained despite his emotional connection to Frances.  The man one would think could bring Frances her much needed romance does not.  And the birth of Patti's child does not make Frances feel included at all.  The turns are small, quiet ones, but they provide enough conflict to keep the viewer engaged.  The cinematography fails to exploit the setting, resulting in a more conventional look than one would expect.

Despite its flaws, this is a sweet, low-key film.  While ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" may appeal to more women than men, it does not have the syrupy romance and teary-eyed moments of most films categorized as ""chick flicks.""  A good solid film that offers nothing exceptional.",1119225600,,2104,4.837988826815643

1953743,3,B0000VD02E,"Based on the book by Frances Mayes, Under The Tuscan Sun is a refreshing fish out of water romantic comedy. After taking a much needed vacation, a recently divorced writer buys a home in Tuscany on a whim, hoping the new home will jump start her journey to newfound happiness. Most likely to be categorized in the 'chick flick' realm, Under The Tuscan Sun follows the life of one woman as she interacts with friends, lovers, and new neighbors in an exotic and beautiful environment. The film portrays all the emotions - the ups and downs, the hopes and dreams - experienced by the main character as she takes on this monumental and spontaneous adventure. In short, Under The Tuscan Sun is an interesting, and oftentimes hilarious, film that tackles the constant travails of life in general...

Thirty-something San Francisco writer Frances (Diane Lane) spirals into a deep depression when her ten-year marriage ends in divorce. To further complicate matters, she lives in a cramped apartment, and the stress of her divorce has left her with writer's block. Her good friend Patti (Sandra Oh), happily pregnant and involved in her own committed relationship, tries to cheer up Frances. But nothing seems to work - at least until a vacation is suggested.

When Frances sets off on a tour of Italy, she unexpectedly gets off the bus and purchases a villa in Tuscany. Hundreds of years old and in disrepair, the home is in dire need of massive renovations. Frances devotes her new life to restoring the home, and she hires a ragtag band of immigrants and local people to help her. Meanwhile, she attempts to find love in her new country, but the harder she tries, the worse off things turn out. When Patti's lesbian lover leaves, she moves to Tuscany for the moral support offered by Frances. Now, Patti must give birth to a new life, and Frances must learn that the best rewards in life arrive when least expected...

Sideways star Sandra Oh makes a name for herself playing the role of Patti, a good friend of Frances. Despite her appearance in a dozen plus films, Under The Tuscan Sun is the first time I can recall seeing Sandra Oh in a movie, and I can remember that she really made an impression. She has a distinctive onscreen presence, something unique that I can't quite identify, and perhaps this contributes in some small way to the current success she's experiencing.

Meanwhile, Diane Lane creates a likeable and relatable character in Frances. Viewers will have no problem relating to divorcee's struggles within her personal life, and even the most pessimistic and dour of movie goers must give her credit for making such a bold move. As such, Under The Tuscan Sun manages to create one of those rare films which isn't so much plot-driven, nor focused on the personality of a monumental life. The film simply serves as a good night's entertainment (and a break, if one is needed, from the typical big money, high body count Hollywood productions). That's why Under The Tuscan Sun is a definite must-see film...

I just have one thing to point out, the point of the movie wasn't for Frances to go to Italy to find a guy and live happily ever after.  It's to show how even if she wasn't with someone, she can still be happy and her life can still be filled with flavour.  That's why all the potential guys in the movie entered and left the screen.  Also, it just goes to show that if she can get herself out of her depression, she could enjoy life more, and eventually things will turn out fine.",1113523200,29,621,4.057377049180328

Some feel-good movies don't end very well at all, so I give credit for the book and the director for the tie-ins at the end.  I the starred reviews, and I think that some people like to pick and pick at things.  I'm surprised that they have a whole list of complaints about this movie, when it is obvious that noone can expect much out of it anyways.  I mean come on, it is very very rare to have a good romantic comedy when the story line is such as it is.  I guess the reason why they are top reviewers is because a lot of people agree with them, but, here's one person who likes to escape for one, and not be realistic.

When you read a book, and than a movie comes out based on it, don't expect it to be as good as the book, because it very rarely is.  Even the movie Lord of the Rings wasn't as good as the book for some people.  And if you look at movies like Harry Potter, Ella Enchanted, Bourne Supremacy.... a lot of these movies aren't better than the book.  So, if you have read the book, and you are thinking about seeing the movie, my advice to you is try not to expect too much.  Think of the movie seperate from the book.

This does not detract  from the film, nor does it detract  from the book; it simply means that the end product in book or film is the product of a rich  piece of material.

Bottom line is that this film is an excellent  watch, which will probably inspire you to look at the book.

If you are going to be pedantic enough to look at the discrepancies  between book and film, or to see how ""unbelievable"" some of the cliches are, you might want to realise that books and films are different mediums, and a film in a hollywood  format is, for the most part, an escapist work, and so is going to be brim full of things that are separate  from reality.

1953775,2,B0000VD02E,"Though officially based on a true story - the autobiographical bestseller by Frances Mayes - ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" plays like one of those slick fiction ""women's pictures"" (now called ""chick flicks"") from the 1950's and 1960's in which a beautiful woman (usually played by Lana Turner or Jean Seberg), unlucky in the ways of love, heads to Europe in the hopes of finding true romance in the arms of the heavily-accented man of her dreams.

This glossy, shallow and superficial soap opera stars Diane Lane as Frances, a semi-successful writer who discovers that her husband is cheating on her with another woman.  After the divorce, in which somehow the husband has managed to finagle almost everything including the house away from her as part of the settlement, Frances agrees to go on a gay bus tour through Italy that two lesbian friends have set up for her.  While on a stopover in Tuscany, the usually far-from-impulsive Frances decides, on the spur of the moment, to purchase a villa replete with bad plumbing and acres upon acres of olive trees.  Without any discernible source of income to make it all possible, Frances divides her time between making major repairs on the place and cavorting all over the Italian countryside, having ""adventures"" with the colorful native and immigrant population and falling under the spell of the handsome young Italian who always seems to be just waiting in the wings in stories such as these. But is he really the right man for her?  Needless to say, with all this going on, we don't see this ""author"" getting a whole lot of writing done during this overseas sojourn (though, at the end, we find that she`s somehow managed - apparently off-camera - to write a whole book about her experiences here).

Diane Lane is so fine an actress that she is able to make even this hokey pablum almost believable at times.  For the most part, though, the film is a case of missed opportunities.  For instance, nothing whatsoever is done with the gay tour aspect of the plot (one suspects that the film might have been more interesting had Frances STAYED on the bus rather than gotten off, as I`m sure a group of gay guys would have known how to have more fun in Italy than she does), and Frances' own story winds up taking a back seat to a bland Romeo and Juliet-type subplot and a whole host of stereotypical minor characters.  Every time Lane begins to bring some depth and reality to her character, the romantic fantasy trappings pile on to overwhelm her.

Don't misunderstand me though. The idea of watching Diane Lane for two hours is something that, for the most part, I find enjoyable, if not entertaining as well but... For the most part stooping to the usual Hollywood cliche's by making our heroine a perennial victim ( cheating hubby AND uncaring lover! ) is not only transparent and terribly obvious but almost patronizing as well. Why is it that Hollywood feels the need to make women total victims of lousy husbands/boyfriends in a pathological desire to cast the films star as innocent and therefore extremely likable? And sadly that's just the beginning of the film that I had originally thought was to be a humorous yet sensitive movie concerning a womans growth and bid for independence. But it was not to be. Cliche's abound and during my initial viewing I almost cringed at dialogue that was less then sterling and a story line that was almost little more then a 'Lifetime Channel for Women' movie of the week.

After our heroine decides to purchase the 'fixer-upper' of her dreams she moves in and with all of the subtlty of a Lucille Ball/Desi Arnez sit-com finds herself in one silly situation after another. Most of those being so contrived and obvious that I could almost tell what might happen next. You know...language problems, getting hired handy men to do their jobs, nosy neighbors, blah, blah, blah. No doubt you get the idea. All the while Ms. Lane makes friends with some of those wacky locals ( why are locals in these types of films always silly and full of character? ). Sadly, the cliche's truly never stop. And if it wasn't for the truly beautiful setting and stunning landscapes I probably would have given up but that may be this films only saving grace.

Nevertheless, of course Ms. Lane meets a gentleman who she seems smitten with and with all of the emotional maturity of an over-sexed sixteen year she old falls in love with the Italian Stallion. Though once again to be done wrong by the cad who doesn't exactly return those very same amorous feelings. Rats! Poor Diane. Just another rotten guy that has no true feelings! Also, why do people in movies such as this fall in love with all the ease of changing one's clothes? Anyway, its all so painfully obvious and juvenile I almost used the DVD as a frisbee to relieve the rotten mood that this movie had put me in. Sorry to all fans of this movie but God knows the victim mentality that permeates this film is not only over-bearing but pandering as well. I guess I was supposed to be wringing my hands all the while thinking, "" Poor, poor Diane. ""

Well, of course at the very end of this...whatever you may call this umm thing, our heroine meets yet devastatingly attractive bachelor. Seems as though in this movie their falling out of the trees! Yes, all wells that ends well and perhaps Diane has found true love after all. You would have thought by this time that Ms. Lane would have learned her lesson but in true Hollywood fashion love conquers all and I suppose that the directors wanted the audience to cross their little fingers and hope that she has found that one true knight in shining armour. Thereby assuring our heroine that she will live happily ever after since in the movies no woman is ever really happy unless she has found her life-time mate. Again, sorry but the nauseating factor at this point was well past the point of anything redeeming this schlock that must cater to women who still believe in soul-mates, puppy-love and Cinderella endings.

With a plot that holds true to real life situations if you are brave enough to take chances, this story is a perfect tale of casting aside your fears and insecurities and taking chances even when you feel like giving up. Frances takes a leap of faith and buys a rustic villa in Tuscany in serious need of a fixing up after a life altering event...a dreaded divorce. After a failed relationship Francis yearns to find love again. She meets a couple different men that help her on the way. As most of us know, you learn from every relationship before finding ""the one."" While she hopes to find the forever kind of love she keeps busy renovating a house she has many dreams of building a life in.

I saw it when it hit the theaters and enjoyed its peaceful, serene, ""writer-ly"" tone.  I enjoyed witnessing the changes within Frances as she goes from ""Respected Reviewer, College Professor"" to ""Camp Divorce Camper"" to ""Tourist"" to ""Doing Something Completely Insane Simply Because There is Nothing Left to Do"" to ""Re-focusing"" to ""Loving Community Member, Whole and Ready.""

I enjoyed the montage of characters echoing the montage of Tuscany in backgrounds, in people, in food -

Yet the second time around, via DVD at home, ohhhhhh - even more magnificent.

I don't think there is a single poor performance among any of the actors. So many fresh faces (to me, because so many cast members are Italian) so much emotion, fire, passion.

I watched the movie and then watched it with the commentary of Audrey Wells, the Writer/Director. She adapted Frances Mayes memoir beautifully - it met with Frances Mayes' approval - not only that, I felt like Wells was an artist wanting to tell a multi-layered, richly textured story.

Subtleties, too, such as the lighting changing in the Villa from darker to lighter throughout the film, to one of the supporting characters actually being named Chiara (the very name taken from ""chiarascuoro"" - a painting technique involving moving from the darkness to the light.

The deleted scenes were treasures, too - so glad they were on the DVD as well.

1953847,3,B0000VD02E,"It's good to see Diane Lane enjoy a career renaissance after such a promising start nearly a quarter-century ago in George Roy Hill's ""A Little Romance"", as a prepubescent American falling in love with a Parisian boy, who whisks her away to Venice under the knowing eye of Laurence Olivier. Ironically, in this most recent movie, she plays an American woman, again in Italy, but this time escaping a broken marriage to find fulfillment in a Tuscan villa she decides to buy on the spot and renovate. Leave it to Lane to make it all look reasonable as what was precocious in the earlier movie has matured into a lovely sense of self-awareness and gravity in this film. And her beauty has become even more striking over the years. She has also become accomplished in displaying several emotions concurrently, layering her characters with a complexity of feelings so that you can never quite predict what she is thinking and what she will do next. Her post-coital train ride in Adrian Lyne's ""Unfaithful"" is a great example of this hard-earned skill. And Lane needs this skill in spades as she plays a fictionalized version of Frances Mayes, the author of the book upon which this greatly altered movie is based. The character seems to be longing for something she never quite figures out, and the actress convincingly portrays this sense of want. In fact, Lane almost saves this movie but not quite.

At heart, this is a patronizing romantic fantasy that feels like it was produced in another era entirely, somewhere in the mid-fifties when Lane's character would be labeled a brazen, put-upon woman tainted by divorce. I kept expecting Rosanno Brazzi to come out and say something ridiculously continental to sweep her off her feet. Instead, we get Raoul Bava, who delivers the smoldering good looks but none of the irony of his rather trite Italian lover role. Lending even more color to the soap opera atmosphere is a gallery of eccentrics with an array of international accents who serve up allegorical fables and Hallmark-card advice to the heroine - an empathetic real estate agent who seems to have a crush on Frances (a flirtation I wish the director could have explored more); the young lovers who must deal predictably with the disapproval of the girl's strict parents; the rest of the inept but dedicated renovation crew; the English free-spirit who worked with Fellini and seems to have kept up her ""la dolce vita"" character in real life; the pregnant lesbian friend abandoned by her lover. Intentionally or not, Frances seems to help set all their lives on the right path, as the picturesquely run-down old villa gradually turns into the home of her dreams and serves as a life-affirming metaphor. So many contrivances riddle the story, especially toward the end when plot threads get tied up quickly. Frances' fate is not all that satisfying to the viewer either, and you know your plot is undercooked when a minor character is introduced in the last few minutes to provide romantic salvation. In truth, I am not sure how much better this movie could have been given the base material, as the story is nothing deeper than the Harlequin romance novels you find in the checkout line at Safeway. It just seems like there are lots of personal problems floating around the plot, but I have to give credit to Lane and director Audrey Wells who jointly make the film anything but sad.  Add to that the travelogue aspect with the lovely cinematography by Geoffrey Simpson of Italy's beautiful landscapes, and you can think of worse ways to spend two hours. And watch it for the true coming-of-age of Diane Lane, radiant, gifted and far more deserving of material better than this.",1101168000,5,3683,4.835182250396197

1953851,2,B0000VD02E,"The imagery in this movie is fantastic (obviously, since it was filmed in Tuscany), however I can't really recommend anything else about it.  For some reason the writers of this film strayed so far from the original story as penned by Frances Maye that it is almost a completely different story.  Which is sad, by the way, because the true story is so charming and would have been superb on film.  Frances Maye's book, Under the Tuscan Sun, is the true story of how she and her husband Ed buy a run-down villa in Tuscany.  The book recounts the adventures Frances and Ed have together while remodeling the house.  Other than the part about buying a house in Tuscany, there's really not much else in the movie that even comes close to the book.  Ed doesn't even appear in the film until literally the last three minutes.  Instead of a happily married and successful writer, Maye is portrayed as a depressed divorcee who is only able to come out of her funk after having a one-night stand with a suave Italian named Marcello (what were you people thinking?).  And for some strange reason, there's this bizarre homosexual motif that runs through the entire first half-hour of the movie.  Why in the world did the writers have Frances discover the villa on a gay romantic tour of Italy, when the real story would have been so much better?  I guess my advice to you is read the book, skip the movie. Or better yet, read the book then go and see A Year in Provence, which is much better.",1095552000,11,1481,4.492537313432836
1953852,5,B0000VD02E,"I read Frances Mayes's book ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" before watching this film and gladly so. While the film took a different road than the book they both wound up smack dab in the middle of beautiful Tuscany each with its own brilliance.

This film was adapted from an original memoir by writer/teacher Frances Mayes as she undertook the renovation of a Tuscan villa. The book is actually quite different than the story in the film but both are wonderful. Diane Lane stars as Frances and the story begins with divorce and the loss of love but it evolves into a sensual journey into Tuscany and ends with genuine love. Lane discovers herself while on a much needed vacation to Italy. She stumbles across a few signs that lead her to buy a beautiful, although run-down, Tuscan villa. This is where the real story begins filled with extraordinary shots of the beauty that can only be found in Tuscany and a brief examination of what makes life in Tuscany so amazing. Lane hires four workers, one Italian and three Polish, to renovate her treasured villa. Along the way walls fall down in clouds of billowing smoke, water boils where it shouldn't, thunder storms create havoc for humans and owls, olive trees begin to bear fruit, and relationships begin to form from a great supporting cast.

This movie about a lost woman found is a true inspiration. Lane is excellent as the middle aged woman who loses her sense of self and discovers she never lost it after all. The movie is about life and love, beauty and new discoveries but mostly it is about family, that richness that gives us life, whether our own or one we pluck from available sources. The scenes are filled with the beauty of Italy, flowers in bloom, wine and food prepared with love and great effort is paid to the scenic views of such a rich country. Be prepared to look for signs of your own after watching this film, craving a table full of food with a family to sit down and enjoy it with and you may even find yourself booking the next flight to Tuscany for some villa shopping of your own under the glorious Tuscan sun of course.",1094169600,14,2094,4.537037037037037

But I was pleasantly suprised with this low-key, wonderfully felt adaptation of Frances Mayes' recollections of her time in the Tuscan countryside. This film depends on the performance of Diane Lane (as Mayes), who, even though she can manage to look stunning in a ratty t-shirt, still comes off as down to earth and approachable, someone who seems to be inviting you into her life. That's what she does in this film. After she discovers her husband is cheating on her, Frances (Lane) falters but then accepts a ticket to Tuscany from one of her gay friends. Admittedly, the trajectory from there is predicatable--she rennovates a Tuscan villa while at the same time rennovating her life, which includes meeting a new man. But the film is more about Frances' self-discovery, experiencing life, and getting her own inner life back on track. The film is also beautifully shot--how could it not be beautiful if the location is Tuscany? I would recommend this one--a lovely film!",1093824000,4,1069,4.944444444444445
1953874,4,B0000VD02E,"The only thing that ruined my pleasure from this movie was the repeated thought ""How can she afford all this....""? A thought that remained with me throughout the viewing. I apologize for being such a material girl but the lovely house does make you wonder. We are talking not only about the house itself whose price we understand how Frances Mayes afforded, but the everyday life who do cost a little money especially if you redo your house with such lovely furniture. It seems that Frances Mayes was very busy during the daytime (the meals she cooked seem to have taken hours to make), and only spent a few hours writing. Was that enough to afford life in Italy? I wonder. The house itself needed intense furnishing which no doubt cost money too... I assume these thoughts come to the mind of anyone watching this movie and asking himself ""why not me""? well money seems to be one of the answers.

However, casting these thoughts aside, this is indeed a movie that is a pleasure to watch, even if the storyline is a little banale and not totally credible. Indeed, the book by the same name is more detailed (and thus tedious) explaining how the long renovations came through. One picture however is worth a thousand words and watching the beautiful Italy is not like reading about it in a book.

Diane Lane is lovely and beautiful and is a joy to watch. Her acting abilities (which were amazing in ""Unfaithful"") do not have a lot of ""meat"" besides several emotional outbreaks (usually over romantic issues) but she is warm and touching. Toscany however is the real star of this film with its landscape, beauty, light and people (together with all the regular cliches about the Italians... even cliches have some truth in them).

1953875,3,B0000VD02E,"The sun is shining in Italy, where you can find a new life.  That's all that 'Under the Tuscan Sun' shows.  If you still want to find another reason to see it, that's Diane Lane, whose delightful acting as American writer 'Frances' deserves every praise bestowed on this light-weight film.

Again I say, the plot is very slim, too slim to hold the weight of the nearly 2 hour film.  Frances, newly divorced, buys an old house in a small villa in Tuscany, in which she finds s new way of life, or new way of looking at that.

So, she finds a new love in hunky Italian Marcello (Raoul Rova); she finds a new family in the kind-hearted neighbors; she even helps an Italian girl and a Polish boy vow the eternal love (which, ironically she finds, is hard to find).  Everything is put in a right place; only that in the fashion of popular romance (and the film is based on the book of the same title by 'Frances' Mayes ... see that?).

In fact there is nothing wrong with the film, except that it was done with many cliched techniques -- broken house which represents life, the best friend (Sandra Oh) who is lesbian, and all the Italian boys who never misses the chance to whisper the words of love to the girls.  If you are likeky to be irritated with these unoriginality, stay away from 'Tuscan Sun.'  As for me, I just pretended that I didn't see them at all.

But Dinae Lane.  She is so delightful that you may (just 'may') forgive and forget any cloying emotions or banal characters.  She even jumps around on the bed, wearing only black underwear, just like Brittney Spears did in 'Crossrards.'  You cannot hate her for doing that.

See for beautiful Diane Lane, or beautiful Tuscan scenery, and forget about the plot.  Three star for them (two for Ms. Lane).",1092787200,5,1761,4.425465838509317

The main character is played by the pretty Diane Lane, but looks alone cannot salvage this dreadful character. She cries, she pouts, she is unbearably naive and, let's just say it, she is an idiot.
The storyline is full of cliches. And where there are not cliches, there are gaping plot holes: why does her far-too-attractive-to-be-true Italian boyfriend drive a sports car when his family run a modest cafe on the beach that is supposed to support all of them? And just how does she manage to up and move to Italy without even having to fill in an immigration form? And if she was so broke that she had to move out of her mansion in San Francisco into a run-down fleabag hotel, just how the hell can she afford to suddenly buy and renovate a house in Italy, as well as living there for months with no visible means of income?

Diane Lane in one of her best roles, her face very expressive, her acting excellent.

The movie trailer says, the character were ""changed for dramatic effect"".

This movie is typical in some ways-divorced lady leaves Frisco
for Tuscony,buys and restores antique home and searches for
a new love. But here's the important part-she doesn't 'get the guy'-and learns a lesson that I think is important;that happiness is within. Unfortunately people in this country,male and female,are becomming more and more emmotionally bankrupt. I
never HEARD terms like 'chick flick' until I was a teenager. I
think it's sexist,ugly and VERY all-American-undercut the differences in people,in every possible way.
  Romantic comedies are usually the most obvious and clished form of film making there is-usually highly predictable plots and very shallow characters. But being based on a classic book there was already a script of sorts to work with. Worth whatching if not for the ending. And it's a well made
film without alot of schmaltz and cutesiness. So I think this

And why? because she gets a divorce from a guy who apparently is having a midlife crisis??? or is it because she packs up and heads off on a gay holiday provided by two lesbian friends?...But this is how she finds the abode of her dreams!.....Actually more like a nightmare.
I think it is a film that deserves the accolades it has gotten, but not because it would only be appreciated by 'chicks', but by anyone who loves Tuscany the way I do.

1953942,3,B0000VD02E,"With women occupying an ever increasing role in the workplace, as well as raising children on their own following divorces, Hollywood has turned away from the old pattern of all too often showcasing beautiful women as ornaments from handsome hunks, in short sex symbols without much to do beyond making their male co-stars happy.
Fortunately the trend has changed and stars like Diane Lane have plenty of meat and bones in their roles.  Such is the case in Under the Tuscan Sun.  The story begins with San Francisco writer and book reviewer Lane reeling under the tragedy of divorce.
Lane is provided with a free tour to Tuscany by a lesbian friend who bypasses the trip she purchased to give birth via in vitro fertilization.  Lane bolts the gay tour in beautiful Tuscany, where she experiences an epiphany.  She becomes enchanted and eventually buys an old house, with a reclamation project following, in the course of which she gets acquainted with the people and the area.
Eventually Lane's lesbian friend turns up in Tuscany with a new baby after her gay relationship ends.  In addition to this adjustment, Lane finds herself awakening in the sexual realm.  An experience with a handsome young man from the area prompts her to see herself as never before.
Lane's character arc in the film is significant as she sees herself in her new setting as never before.  The relationship with the handsome young local has a strong bearing in bringing her out and creating a more developed woman.  By the film's end she has enhanced her understanding of life and become more mature.

The story centers around Frances, who after a bitter divorce, ends up in Italy and  becomes drawn to an Italian villa that is a bit of a fixer-upper.  On a whim, she buys the place and with a motley crew of workers, begins to restore the home.

Yes, there is romance and there is comedy, but that is REALLY not the focus of the film. In fact, viewers may be fooled when male characters are introduced--they're not all potential love interests, like you'd expect in other movies. Life is not that simple!
It is really the story of a woman who proves to herself that she can make it on her own, without a man, anywhere and anytime.  On a trip to Italy, trying to take her mind off her recent divorce, she spontaneously buys an Italian villa...one which needs a lot of work and repairs...and settles herself in this country.  She slowly makes it her home, while making friends in a foreign land and learning a new culture.
I really enjoyed this movie for the scenes of Italy and its faithful presentation of Italian culture (not just the stereotypical view of Italians you get in American T.V. shows and movies).  Besides the Italian people, there are Italian cuisine, beautiful villas, tours of the countryside, and people of other nationalities.  I don't know how anyone can watch this film without seriously considering hopping on a plane and moving to Italy permanently.",1084924800,4,1248,4.7592592592592595
1953947,5,B0000VD02E,"Diane Lane has always, even as a child reminded me of Natalie Wood. Both were child stars, both posses a similar beauty and way with a smile that turns up just so on the sides. Each is a multi-layered actress of considerable talent. And above all they have made me fall rapturously in love with them.  My ability therefore to give a rational review of this film, ""Under The Tuscan Sun"" is reduced to that of a love struck thirteen year old boy.
  From the book of the same name by Frances Mayes the film is an altered and fresh look at the original. The direction and screenplay by Audrey Wells is top notch and she gives an insightful commentary on the DVD of her film.  It is in her screenplay is where she really shines. She reshapes Mayes book into something magical and infuses it with the charm and glamour of Italy both in the flesh and in the movies.
  Vincent Riotta is the quite center to the story and is the romantic realist who gently leads Frances into her adventure in Italy. He commands your attention with a quiet and wise presence. Raoul Bova, one of the hottest stars in Italy brings just the right touch of romance and danger to his role as Marcello. In his final scene he is both honest and fair.
  Sandra Oh hits all the right notes of comedy and drama as Frances' best friend Patti. Her remark on the steaming toilet is a study in comedy timing. Well, she is a master as anyone who has seen her work on Arliss can attest.
  The wonderful discovery in this film for me is the British actress, Lindsay Duncan who portrays Katherine, the ex-Fellini star who is trapped like a fly in amber by her film past but lives for today within her celluloid cocoon.  Adding her to the mix puts just the right touch of cinema magic into the story. I am looking forward to see what she does on the upcoming HBO series ""Rome"".
  Finally there is Miss Lane. Her work here is brilliant and filled with the grit and grime of a true actress at work. Yet it is seamless and so natural without a false move or an unsure moment. She inhabits Frances from frame one and caries her and the audience from her despair to rebirth and rejoicing in a new and unexpected life. Her eyes, her smile, her glowing skin become so real on the screen and we find we are given a gift from this actress of so many gifts. We are given the pure joy of watching her in the here and now inhabit a space in our hearts. With this film and her previous appearance in  ""Unfaithful"" she joins the pantheon of stars that like Spencer Tracy, Ingrid Bergman, or Natalie Wood who make it all look so easy, so real.",1084233600,8,2583,4.288065843621399

However after seeing this movie I felt compelled to write a reveiw.
Basically the plot is somewhat predictable and horribly cliche; enough people ran through it already so I do not beleive that it is my duty. However the most predictable parts of this movie are when she goes to the Italian lovers house and finds out that he already has a woman under his roof. (Perhaps she should have rode back with the officer and then made this movie at least interesting).
It is from the aformentioned point that the movie goes seriously downhill. The author found it neccessarey to give this movie a happy ending and amazingly one fell from the sky, with the American author appearing out of nowhere and the deadfully cheesy out of class relationship with the Polish kid and the Italian girl.

It is a very visual movie and Ms. Lane feels her character so much that you feel with her and that speaks volumes.

Yes, I know it's a romantic comedy, 'chick flick', and realism is not usually a necessary goal, but please, you must be kidding!
She enters Italy, buys a house and moves there permanently on a whim?  With minimal savings (after buying a villa with an olive grove!), no income (we don't see her write or review anything in the year she is in Italy), no health coverage, nothing, and no long-stay visa, no governmental red tape?
Everyone speaks English? And learning to speak Italian just happens to her, despite only speaking with English, American and Polish expatriate friends?
The house renovation is brief and (aside from 1 or 2 comic moments) easy and apparently... free. She just cooks for her polish workman and they love her.  Let's remember, she has no car and she is in rural Tuscany (wouldn't you love to see her carry home all the groceries for these feasts.)
See meets a stunning, sexy, fit, self-confidant, young, Italian man... after a few hours together, has sex with him (Don't get me wrong - looked like fun), doesn't see him again for a month, and then is surprised that, when she sees him next, he has already moved on. No, really?
As for the lesbian couple: They are committed enough to decide to have a baby (no accidents here), so try to concieve repeatedly (making reference that they were finally sucessful concieving on the 5th try) and then when one is apparently 8 months pregnant, the other decides she ""isn't ready to be a mother""!  What???  And the very pregnant friend flies to Tuscany, with no invitation or warning!?  She doesn't speak Italian, she doesn't have a doctor in Italy... but we are to assume that her health-coverage covers giving birth in Italy!  WOW! Who's her insurance company?
Yes, the scenery is beautiful, but it's Tuscany and the Amalfi Coast. Of course, it's beautiful!  And, the ending was sweet and romantic. (Wow, what a suprise.)

1953985,4,B0000VD02E,"This movie has two things going for it that are quite appealing to me.  One is Diane Lane because we are now both old enough that I do not have to feel guilty about having a crush on her in 1979 when she was barely a teenager and I was in graduate school.  The other is Tuscany, because films like this are siren calls for tourists, especially if half the blood flowing in your veins is Italian in the first place.  As a result of those twin forces I probably had higher expectations for this film than is warranted by what director Audrey Wells has put together.
The story is relatively simple.  Frances Mayes is a writer and critic who finds out her husband is having an affair.  There is more injury to add to this insult in terms of divorce, alimony that she owes him, and the loss of her house.  With nothing better to do Frances is sent by her friend Patti (Sandra Oh) on a gay bus tour of Tuscany where she stumbles across a nice little villa for sale.  Frances knows that the way her life is going buying it would be a terrible idea.  But an eccentric expatriate named Katherine (Lindsay Duncan) tells her, ""Don't you just love those?""  So it comes to pass that Frances buys a Italian villa that is in as much need of repair as her own shattered life.
The villa is obviously the master metaphor in this film for the main character, but Wells does not spend as much time on it as she should.  Maybe it is because Bob Villa and all of those who have followed in his wake have been the restoration of old homes a familiar experience for us.  One of the deleted scenes on the DVD shows the discovery of the fresco on one of the villa's walls, which is exactly the sort of detail that we want to enjoy.  We know that this house will be a home by the end of the film, so it is the process of transformation that matters, especially as it parallels that of Frances herself.
This movie wants to be unconventional.  At one point Frances unburdens herself and is told by the compassionate man to whom she is speaking: ""Signora, please stop being so sad. If you continue like this, I will be forced to make love to you, and I've never been unfaithful to my wife.""  This movie is not Katharine Hepburn's trip to Italy in ""Summertime.""  For those who are waiting expectantly for the new man in Frances' life to come walking through the door, this film is going to tease you in that regard until you are forced to think that maybe something else is happening here.
I know that Wells took great liberties with the book written by the real Frances Mayes, who restored an abandoned villa in Italy without the motivation of a brutal divorce, but since the author did not complain and I have not read the book I have no reason to complain on that score.  Instead I will point to the fact this film is only 102 minutes long and that if this film had clocked in close to two hours Wells would have been able to flesh out the restoration of the villa and the eccentric neighbors that become so important in the cinematic Frances' new life as she goes native.
The end of the film recognizes the importance of those two elements, but they are often overwhelmed over the course of ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" by the less than satisfactory romantic elements.  Fortunately Lane's performance forgives many of the fault's of the script and shows that after her Oscar nominated performance in ""Unfaithful"" that she now has some serious momentum going on in her acting career.  She is so busy being at the center of this story of how Frances puts her life back together than both the character and the audience are surprised by the arrival of the requisite happy ending.
In the final analysis ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is not going to convert anyone.  Confirmed romantics are going to find enough of what they crave in this film to make themselves happy and those who roll their eyes at such endeavors will have ample occasion to keep their orbs spinning.  Those who read Mayes' novel will be wondering why they even bothered to keep her name for the main character and those who are fans of Diane Lane will simply be ecstatic to see her name appearing above the title.",1082160000,3,4139,4.392670157068062

(some spoilers ahead: consider yourself warned)
I have to agree with those that say the movie is a bit unrealistic (surrealist, I'd almost say, at some points -those Tuscan landscapes kill me!). One of the things that kept bugging me about the movie was how much money must the character have made off of her divorce, to be able buy and remodel a Tuscan villa while not working for a living.
On the side, I can see how some people would find objectionable the fact that, in essence, the divorce of the main character is largely compared with the breakup between her friend Patti and her lesbian partner later in the movie. As a matter of fact, this and the introduction of her partner as an open character in the movie, are elements that make me dismiss this movie as being your typical ""pink"", ""sunday afternoon"" chick flick, which I really appreciate in times when the whole gay marriage controversy is being addressed more openly. In that sense, the movie goes along with the times, as much as you may differ in criteria with the values it promotes.
As a whole, controversial in some ways and unrealistic as it results at times, the movie results enjoyable, with landscapes of the Tuscan hills and beautiful views of the Mediterranean accentuating a nice performance by Diane Lane.",1082073600,4,1547,4.608695652173913

First of all as someone who has traveled through Italy I felt the way the country was depicted was amazing, there are some stunning visuals in this movie that will make you want to book the first flight to Tuscany, incredibly stunning landscape.

The luminescent Diane Lane stars as Frances, an intelligent, loving women with close and committed friends who finds herself in a situation that many people do: with a mate who has fallen out of love, wants a divorce as well as possession of a much loved and painstakingly renovated house, this one in San Francisco. After the divorce Frances goes to Tuscany on a lark, falls in love with a villa there, buys it and proceeds to renovate it. The villa then is the physical manifestation of the shedding of her old life and marriage and the hope for the renovation and rehabilitation of her love life as well as her life in general.
That she probably places too much faith in the physical to solve the emotional does not detract at all from the guts and hope that it takes to do so. And Lane is so psychically centered and open as Frances that you cannot help but be moved by her situation.
There are some silly plot lines and performances that I wish weren't, but with a central performance as attractive and genuinely loving and feminine as Lane's, ""Under The Tuscan Sun"" is as warm and inviting as bread just out of the oven. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title",1081728000,4,1455,4.557251908396947

Granted, Hollywood has done that with certain minorities before, but this best friend hardly filled any stereotype. And in fact, the reason Hollywood places those ""token"" minorities in is because it makes the screen more INTERESTING and DIVERSE! Not to mention REALISTIC! The entirety of America is not all white, and sometimes putting a person of color in a film does add some spark and dimension to the film.
Not to mention, this particular actress held her own, exuded her own personality altogether, and made the film better.
As for taking liberties with the book...the beginning of the movie admits to fabricating some of the information. And if you want to talk about taking liberties with a translation from book to film, take a look at the film Chocolat.",1081296000,2,1192,4.79126213592233

I have not read the book yet, and I won't, I heard that the book isn't even as good as the film. Don't get me wrong I think Diane Lane [UNFAITHFULL] did  great job with this roll, she might even deserve an award but the film over all is not as great as the hype played it out to be. All the cast and crew did good jobs and the film was shot wonderfully but that does not save it. My advice is to go rent it and see from there.",1081209600,,554,3.6166666666666667
1954016,4,B0000VD02E,"Frances (Diane Lane) is a writer who has just gone through a nasty divorce. Disgruntled in San Francisco, she finds that her friend's insistence that she take a trip to Tuscany is a blessing in disguise. But Frances doesn't just stay for a touristy trip-she impulsively falls in love with a old villa and thus begins her life in Italy. This new life, it turns out, is the best thing Frances could have. In a quiet, gradual way she begins to deal with her divorce and finds lessons, friends, love, and a beautiful new existence.
I didn't expect much from ""Under the Tuscan Sun."" It sounded fairly dippy and a bit too cute. I was sure it would be one of those movies that tries maniacally hard to tug at your heartstrings and becomes intolerable for that reason. But, wonder of wonders, it wasn't!
Somehow, Diane Lane captured her character perfectly. Frances (or Francesca, as she was known in Italy) seemed like someone to root for. She didn't usually look or dress like a movie star-much of the time in the movie she wore old flannel shirts and a scraggly ponytail-and reacted to her new life and friends as we ourselves might. Frances alternately blunders, rejoices, makes unwise romantic decisions, yet somehow comes out right.  No matter what the film moment, Lane knew what to deliver, and this helped the film move along naturally and smoothly.
I also enjoyed the somewhat unpredictable nature of this movie. Yes, I knew from the start that things were going to end up somewhat happily at the end, but really didn't know how. And that was one of the big reasons why I liked ""Under the Tuscan Sun."" Its rambling pace just seemed so natural, and the fact that Frances's life takes quirky little dips and dives makes the movie all the better. You really ""sink into"" the film, and watching the lives of Frances and her friends change feels interesting, realistic, and fun. Another aspect of the plot that I greatly enjoyed was that Frances's love life was NOT picture perfect! She seemed so much more likeable then. (Will say no more about this, as do not want to spoil plot).
No, ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is nothing that will win an Academy Award. But it's warm, pleasurable, and the next best thing to an Italian vacation.",1081123200,2,2224,4.644670050761421

I have to admit, though, arguing with some of the previous reviews that I saw, that despite all of the stereotypes, they were mostly true! Certainly true to my experience. Italians are proud of who and how they are and although I didn't meet a single person who spoke english as well as anyone in this film, that was the only stretch as far as I could tell. Its an absolute pleasure to watch, especially for anyone who has been to Italy. And Diane Lane is adorable and full of life, almost inspirational.
See this film if you want to escape to Italy for 2 hours and be a single, liberated, middle-aged woman going on an adventure. That's really what it is good for - transporting us americans away from our own ""culture"" and into a place that has a real sense of history and people.

To begin with the pivotal character, Diane Lane. Her performance as a crestfallen divorcee American writer is a disappointing, she twitched and grimaced like a female Hugh Grant, using delayed reaction goggle-eyes instead of emotion.
Needless scenes abound. The self-grabbing congratulatory dance she did in her bedroom after scoring with her young stud was just plain agonizing to watch. Another awful scene was when Patti came back pregnant and abandoned and lay in the bed crying. Diane Lane's face was vacant, with a fake little soap opera frown of concern on her brow and a simpering smile on her mouth. Awful, and inexcusable of the director to leave that shot in.
Italian stereotypes? Truckloads:
(1) Crazy old contessa who takes bird poop on the forehead of a stranger as a sign to sell her the prized villa. Okay, whatever, even though she would have gotten more money from the German couple who had first dibs.
(2) Suave love-em and leave-em Romeos? All over the place. Even a romantic stud who says things like ""Your eyes are beautiful. I would love to swim in them"".
(3) Simple, good-hearted locals happy to pick your olives for you? A villageful.
(4) An inane young couple whose parents don't consent to their idiotic relationship? Yes, and our American sweetheart swerves their mind in less than 5 minutes.
(5) People falling from trees in the backyard. Yep.
(6) Three Italian construction workers who worked for 8-9 months for almost nothing while maintaining a wonderful attitude all the time? Hmm.
Whether all of this Hollywood view of countryside Italy suits your gullible palate or not, all of this is just too drawn out to retain a viewer's attention.
To add a final dollop of fuel to the fire, after all these ordeals, our poor Ms. Frances ends up with a goofy-looking failed American writer anyway. All that prime Italian beefcake down the drain. Like my evening watching this.",1080691200,65,2107,4.871866295264624

In fact, this trip provides to the viewer good locations (especially the ones taken at the city of Positano, in South Italy), a brief look at the habits and style of life in this otherwise fascinating Mediterranean country. But that's all. The movie is just another bittersweet story of love, friendship and delusions without anything new to be taken or even a minimal original approach to such pondering themes. Many viewers will certainly find this movie amusing and lighthearted - and this is a correct mode to describe this one - but it's shallow characters and routine treatment made the final outcome just a passable but unnoticed experience. Beautifully filmed, with good locations and a fine piece of work of photography.

Some parts are ok, but most parts are so laughably unbelievable or hollywoodized that it turns out to be laughable. I don't want to waste any more of my time writing a detailed review of a movie that I could barely watch (it was my wife's birthday, I had to -- and even she hated it). So, for all of you saying something about wanting to know what was so bad about this film, I'll give you one thing:
You know all those glorified love scenes in classic movies where a VIABLE couple finally meets, and their first kiss on the beach lasts from day until night! Yeah, well,... no.
If this movie is on a plane, I would recommend listening to the conversation in the cockpit or thumb wrestling with the toddler who is kicking your chair.

It's a REAL girlie film (I am NOT a girl), but I still adored it.
Diane Lanes character is going through a divorce, and is given a trip to Tuscany by her good friends, to help her get over the split.
When she gets to Tuscany, she is immediately taken by the beauty of Italy.
She reads the 'signs' early on, and on an impulse buys a Tuscan villa, which is in dire need of renovation.
The rest of the story concentrates on her rebuilding her life, the people she meets, and the difficulties that that presents especially in a foreign country.
This is a real feel-good film, and I loved the strength the character displayed.
The film offered no surprises, you know exactly what will happen throughout, but sometimes, that's exactly the kind of film you need!
A wonderful, heart warming, inspirational, touching and genuinely lovely film.
(And it was a real reminder to go back to Italy soon - the filming of the scenery was stunning)
The DVD extras?
  Adequate; 3 deleted scenes which are always nice, and a nice documentary.
  HOWEVER - I found a hidden extra - and a REALLY good one it is too!

I will give this movie some credit. If I had to rate this movie based on scenery and physical environment I would give it 5 stars all the way! The scenery was breathtaking and gorgeous! However....The rest was just awful! The whole storyline is predictable and it's another example of Hollywood using the same formula at scoring for an audience.

In typical fashion, the movie is also full of ignorant stereotypes. You have your leading beautiful, blond actress (Diane Lane - who is not a bad actress that's why I feel sorry for her that she had to be in this film), a token Asian friend (because of course you need a minority to be correct in Hollywood's ridiculously politically correct world), and of course Italian people that they stereotyped to death. If you talk to any real Italian or European person they will tell you that this is a disgrace to what Europeans pride themselves on being.

There are several likeable characters in the movie. I especially enjoyed the older,handsome,but unfortunately married real estate agent.  I felt for Ms. Lane's character - too bad he was taken!  I haven't read the book, but I read a review that said that actually the main character and her husband renovated the house in Tuscany (not the new divorcee on her own looking for love and fulfillment), so maybe that's why this movie falls short -too much artistic license.  In any case, you might enjoy this light movie, or you might be disappointed, but if you like Diane Lane's natural beauty and intensity, you should see ""A Walk On the Moon"" (one of my favorite movies)and ""Unfaithful"".

It's so pretty to watch as well-- bright and full of color-- and that's not just because of the flowers and the stunning hillsides, the actors bring plenty of color to the film as well. Diane Lane is especially enjoyable in this one, playing a character we all knew she would be a perfect fit for, because let's face it, Diane Lane can do very little wrong.
She plays Frances, a newly divorced writer who becomes so miserable in her life living in an apartment complex for divorcees that she decides to take her friend's offer to go on a romantic tour of Tuscany-- a gay romantic tour of Tuscany. Not that this matters at all in the film (because it really doesn't), but this is the reason she decides to leave in the first place because she'll have no chance that anyone will hit on her while she's ""Gay And Away.""
Taking yet another chance, Frances buys an adorable little villa called Bramasole, which is just as picturesque as can be. Soon we get a plethora of interesting characters-- two ethnically mis-matched teens in love, a guy who never talks that can't stop shaking when he's around Frances, a goofy rotund contractor, a crazy blonde actress and more. This all equals a fun movie that no one should miss.
Okay, so some cliches are employed here, but just think of how many movies do this. It's hard to create a truly original film without using some of the elements that audiences have come to love in a love story. Cliche is perhaps afterall a much overused word in the movie business. What matters is that a movie is fun to watch with fun characters and a plot that will no doubt make you smile. That's what's truly important. So get this movie and smile, just like Frances learns to do.",1078012800,,1719,4.4603174603174605
1954110,2,B0000VD02E,"A while ago we saw Diane Lane give a terrific performance in the movie ""Unfaithful"", which was a remake of Claude Chabrol's ""La Femme Infidel"". The film itself was uneven, but Diane Lane was so good as the straying wife that she was nominated for an Academy Award.
In ""Under The Tuscan Sun"" Diane Lane once again gives a very good performance. The problem is that ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is not even half the film that ""Unfaithful"" was.  I don't really like defining movies as chick flicks or otherwise, but there's really no other way to describe this one. And it's a movie for not very discerning chicks at that.
It's based on Francis Mayes book of the same name, a book that hit the bestseller lists largely because it was the stuff of many a middle-class fantasy: one day I'm going to walk away from all this and get back to a simpler live in the countryside of Provence, or Sardinia, or Greece, or Tuscany.
The book has its devoted fans. It also has its ardent critics, most of whom were put off by Francis Mayes' egocentricity and her somewhat patronising view of the quaint locals. So self-involved is the writer that many readers can't even figure out who the mysterious man is that is accompanying her as the villa in Tuscany gets renovated. A husband? A lover? Or what?
Well, whatever he is Audrey Wells, the writer and director of the film didn't want him around. She felt that the story of a couple renovating a house didn't have enough dramatic potential, so in this version Diane Lane's character discovers her husband has been unfaithful, divorces him, and heads off to Italy to rebuild her life and her heart. That, of course, makes this all very much a chick flick. It even has all the clich&eacute;s that such a film should have. Jokes about women's liking for chocolate. The gay best friend Patti (played by Sandra Oh). In fact there's a whole coach load of gay friends in this one. There's the old meet cute. There's the woman who is divorced but whom virtually every man seems to fancy. There's a childbirth scene. And a wedding scene. And of course there's the dashing European, Marcello (Raoul Bova), who is just as fickle as the husband she has just divorced but who is revealed to be not quite so nasty because ... well ... he's continental. When a married Italian guy or two go after our heroine, it's OK because they are European and it's expected. When her American husband does the same thing it's grounds for divorce. And of course, you just know that this estrogen fest has to have a new and more long lasting love in it somewhere, even if that love does take a long time to turn up. There's also a character who's intended to be one of the girlz in a ""Sex and the City"" kind of way, but is actually quite a sad case, something the movie avoids pointing except for one brief scene, and then takes back by the end.
It's awful.
I'm sorry. I know that some women who want solace for the soul or the broken heart may get something from it. But it's a terrible movie. It's all so calculating and by the numbers. I don't think a romantic movie clich&eacute; is missed from beginning to end, although they're also all overlaid here with a kind of half baked politically correct liberalism. Do women really want a Latin lover who says, and I'm not kidding: ""I am going to make love all over you"". I've seen porn movies like that that, but is this really the stuff of romance?
But you should know what to expect. Audrey Wells previously wrote that other major victimised chick flick: ""The Truth About Cats and Dogs."" That's another film that some women found a devastating reflection of men's simple minded obsession with physical beauty without realising that it was actually ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" in reverse, and thus just as critical of the distaff side as of testosterone poisoned males.
I can't even say, for ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" that it's beautifully photographed. Geoffrey Simpson is the cinematographer. But Tuscany is so beautiful that no one could help capturing some of its beauties, or if they could they should be shot, and not merely by a camera.
The only reason to watch ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is the luminous Diane Lane.""
The film itself is terrible, and manipulative, but if you're willing to sit through all this nonsense for a wonderful performance by the beautiful, but by Hollywood terms over the hill, Diane Lane, you might get something from it. Otherwise forget it.",1077926400,9,4411,4.576485461441214

When her friend offers her a ticket to tour romantic Tuscany, in an attempt to get her mind off her troubles, Frances decides to make the trip permanent.  She buys a villa, hires people to help her fix it up, and looks for love all over again.  This movie is all about love, but not necessarily love for Frances.  It's about young love between a Polish worker and a teenage Italian girl; it's about love between a mother and her baby daughter; and it's about the love an old man has, which Frances is never really able to figure out.
While the subplots and storylines help tell a general theme as Frances tries to discover whether or not love really does exist, it wasn't enough to hold my interest.

There are a few bumps along the way, but she finally succeeds.  The scenery in this movie is breathtaking and it alone is worth the price of admission.

1954113,4,B0000VD02E,"If you love Italy then go see this movie. If you like real and intelligent characters then go see this movie. If you hate romantic comedies then go see this movie.
I am not a huge fan of the romantic comedy genre. More often than not, a romantic comedy is nothing more than a few good looking people thrown together and saddled with a lousy script. That's not to say that there aren't notable exceptions, but for the most part they suck. Based on the previews for this movie, I didn't have high hopes, however I did receive a free pass to watch a sneak preview for the movie, so how could I say no?
Having not read the book, I really didn't know what to expect. Let me tell you it was a pleasant surprise. For starters, Diane Lane was the perfect choice for the lead character Frances Mayes. She brings a natural reality to the character, instead of the saccharin sweet typically found in a romantic comedy. Diane instantly makes you feel like you know this woman. She's your neighbor, or someone you work with. In the scene after she learns of her husband's infidelities, she looks horrible - exactly like you'd expect like a woman would look after traumatic news. Of course Diane Lane is a very beautiful woman and as the movie progresses that becomes more and more apparent. Luckily Diane is more than just a pretty face and her performance is stellar. The movie as a whole is understated, letting things play out instead of spelling everything out and Diane provides a wonderful tapestry for you to see what is happening to her. Her reactions tell you more than pithy dialog ever could and as a result you end up taking the journey with her.
As much as I loved Diane Lane in this movie, she is surrounded by an incredible supporting cast. Sandra Oh, as the best friend, delivers an authentic performance. Instead of the typical ""funny sidekick"" so often played by those in the role of best friend, she's down to earth and real. Raoul Bova plays the Italian lover and should make most women weak in the knees, but I found Vincent Riotta, the real estate agent, to be a much richer character. And speaking of rich characters, Lindsay Duncan plays a wonderful eccentric as Katherine who almost serves as a fairy godmother.
Although the acting is surpurb, what brings it all together are the talents of Audrey Wells who serves as the screenplay writer, director and producer. Most of Audrey's background has been in writing. This is only her second film as a director, yet you wouldn't know it by watching the film. Clearly Ms. Wells has a love of Italy and a love of the novel and all of that shows on the screen. She filmed in the cities that are represented and she hired actors that are the nationality in which they play and the age in which they should be. The entire films shines with authenticity and coupled with wonderful performances and directing, Audrey has redefined the romantic comedy.
This movie was refreshing, witty, poetic, dramatic and rich with characters that you not only like, but identify with. It was such a breath of fresh air that I'm ready to see it again and again. This film is definitely going into my DVD collection.",1077840000,3,3150,4.567137809187279
1954114,2,B0000VD02E,"Diane Lane is a gifted actress who had just started to come into her own in recent times.  I realise that good scripts aren't plentiful for actors over 35, but Diane should have left this one alone.  I also have to agree with another reviewer about Diane's facial expressions during this film - quite annoying!
Full of every cliche possible, the film does not allow you to think even for a second. On top of that, every scene seemed to be stolen from another movie.
The scenery thankfully is the movie's saving grace.  Watch it for that alone.

With all the rave reviews about the film, and it's long cinema run, I guess I was looking for something more.  This is one of those movies that will probably take a second showing in order to grow on me.
Otherwise, it is worth viewing if you enjoy the theme of a woman who escapes, or should I say, runs away to beautiful Italy to live a somewhat carefree life that still does not allow her to escape disappointment and a slight experience of heartache with an Italian hunk!  The ending did not leave me with that warm feeling.",1077580800,,681,4.255813953488372
1954116,3,B0000VD02E,"After years of assuming that the movie is not as good as the book it is based on, I have come across a run of movies that are a real improvement over the books. Freaky Friday, A Year in Provence (a TV miniseries), and now Under the Tuscan Sun.
Under the Tuscan Sun is not a great movie, but it is pleasant and fun to watch. The book was pleasant as well, but Frances Mayes, the author of the book, did not seem like an easy person to know and came across as a bit of a snob. She was almost insufferable in her sequel book, Bella Tuscany.
Diane Lane, as Frances Mayes in the movie, plays a different and more likeable character. In fact, about the only thing that is the same in the movie as in the book is that the house is called Bramasole and is in Tuscany.
The Tuscan and San Francisco scenery is beautiful, Frances's Italian boyfriend is gorgeous (those lips!), and the plots weave their way to a happy, if unlikely, ending.
Much of the story doesn't stand up well to scrutiny, but this isn't the sort of movie you really analyze too closely. Otherwise the eccentric character played by Lindsay Duncan, the spur-of-the-moment purchase of a Tuscan villa, and even the kitten on the beach, would all seem more than a little contrived.
So enjoy this movie for what it is: a chick flick, date movie, or a bit of fluffy escapism to see once.",1077580800,3,1340,4.321428571428571

1954118,3,B0000VD02E,"Under the Tuscan Sun is a pleasant story, bolstered by the undeniable appeal of a wonderful actress.  Diane Lane far outshines the various inadequacies of the story and its script.  Granted, Ms. Lane could coast through this bit of fluff relying on little more than her luminescent beauty alone, yet she provides plenty of texture and nuance to her role as a writer/reviewer looking to rebound from a particularly painful divorce.
Lane's character, Frances is persuaded to take the place of two lesbian friends on a guided tour of Tuscany (under the banner of ""We're Gay... and Away"").  Believably or not, she leaves the tour mid-bus ride to purchase a small villa in need of a lot of repair.  The ""uprooting your life on a whim"" device is a little trite, but then who hasn't fantasized about a dramatic relocation as the cure for a life crisis?  From there the story (what little there is of it) balances between a voyage of personal discovery and the tale of an Italian money pit (a lire loser perhaps).
Sandra Oh does well as Frances' pregnant friend and Lindsay Duncan catches notice in a poorly defined role as the local eccentric expatriate, but neither actress is given much purpose other than to provide dialogue and the occasional mild shock.  The real costar here is the gorgeous scenery of Tuscan Italy, so much so that I'd recommend this movie to anyone contemplating a vacation to that region.
The ultimate verdict regarding Under the Tuscan Sun is that it is light fare, that provides a visual feast combining the wonderful appeal of one of Hollywood's truly great beauties along with some of the most romantic countryside you'll ever see.  Women will enjoy Lane's growing empowerment and self-discovery, while men will simply enjoy watching her, and all will treasure the locale and the people of Tuscany.",1077580800,,1820,4.851612903225806

1954145,1,B0000VD02E,"Movies approach responses to pain in either one of two ways: embrace the pain and fight through to experience breakthroughs in character, or avoid the pain as much as possible and recreate your life.  Robert Duvall finds out his wife is having an affair in The Apostle and embarks on a journey of spiritual healing and personal revival.  Diane Lane finds out her husband is having an affair in Under the Tuscan Sun and she runs to Italy, becomes determined to make her own fun, and sleeps with a man she just met.
The problem is, her philosophy just doesn't work in real life.  Can anybody honestly say that hiding our pain behind wine, romance, and laughter permanently heals the wounds?  Are they not going to resurrect themselves later in even uglier ways?  Ironically, it doesn't work for the Diane Lane character either, but her disappointment is more of a plot construction than a message to viewers about the folly of pain management.
You owe it to yourself.  Be happy.  Make yourself feel better, whatever it takes.  Isn't that kind of hedonism the baseline for crack addicts, drunks, and promiscuous folks?  I would write this movie off as a harmless romp with beautiful scenery, but with characters representing divisive views on pregnancy, lesbianism, and sexual liberty, the movie's creator had far more in mind than a simple romantic comedy.

The cast is top-notch, with especially fine performances by Sandra Oh, Vincent Riotta, and Lindsay Duncan.  The movie is a star-turn for Diane Lane, however, and she is so good that she does absolutely nothing to call attention to her acting.  She simply fleshes out her character with yet another performance fine enough to make me wonder why she doesn't get the favorable press lavished on a number of less talented (and less photogenic) actresses.

I know that things work out remarkably well when you are beautiful and have a script writer to make sure that they work out well, but my simple mind can forgive these transgressions of logic.
The premise of the movie, for what it is worth, is entirely viable.  As a worker bee who enjoys his job, I would have a hard time renouncing my home and buying a villa in Tuscany.  That being said, when we got to that part of the movie, I did say: ""Wouldn't that be fun for a while..."".

He takes one look at her flowery, overwrought prose and throws it down in disgust, saying, ""Mom will never believe I wrote that!"" Like the words on that postcard, there are many cringe-worthy moments in this film.
We get a homogenized, romanticized view of Tuscany, the way most middle-aged American women who feel unloved by their cloddy spouses might imagine it.  Stereotypes abound--there's the red-hot younger Italian lover (named Marcello, of course) whose broken English is supposed to be charming; the free-spirited, batty English woman (the fabulous Lindsay Duncan trapped inside a cliche) who takes joy in shocking the locals; the star-crossed young lovers; the elderly man still pining for his dead love; and the sassy yet approachable gay friend.
Diane Lane is stunning as usual, but she mugs for the camera and hams it up a la Julia Roberts or Meg Ryan in too many instances, as if the audience might be too stupid to pick up on nuanced emotion.  She's played unhappy characters of this age before, and much more subtly and convincingly, in ""Unfaithful"" and ""A Walk on the Moon.""

What an imbecilic, pandering fraud this movie is! So smug and enraptured with its Childlike Brilliance and Use of Symbols.

1954178,4,B0000VD02E,"""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is at turns a delightful and sad romantic comedy romp full of a number of clever and unexpected twists and turns. San Francisco writer Frances Mayes ( Diane Lane) discovers her husband's affair and the discovery shatters her life. When he seeks alimony, she's forced to sell him the house that they renovated together with her mother's money. At first she takes residence in an apartment building where it seems everyone is lamenting a lost love or smarting over a divorce. As the first anniversary of her ""freedom"" looms, a lesbian friend takes her out to dinner and makes her an offer she can't refuse. She gives Frances a ticket to Italy. Frances is afraid of finding new romance. It's not something she's likely to do on the trip however as the tour is for gays and lesbians and her friend is unable to go because she's pregnant.
While out and about on her own, she sees  a picture of a villa for sale. On the spur of the moment she decides to purchase it. She wants to radically reshape her life and sees this as the opportunity to do so.  With the blessing of pigeon poop on her head (evidently a ""sign"" to the elderly owner that she deserves the old and crumbling villa), Frances earns the right to purchase the place. What ensues is beautiful scenery, a series of comedic and sad  events as she remodels her new villa culminating in an unexpected second chance at romance.
Based on Frances Mayes' best-selling book, Audrey Wells has fashioned a memorable and unpredictable romantic comedy about second chances. If you're a fan of Mayes' book you may be disappointed. The basic premise is similar but, beyond that, the film has little to do with Mayes book. My advice, get it over it and enjoy the movie for what it is not what it isn't.
 Filled with memorable character actors from Italy, American and the UK, ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" eschews the typical formula seen in Nora Epstein's movies in favor of a series of unpredictable and interesting plot twists. Diane Lane gives a marvelous performance as Frances Mayes (which I should note is a fictionalized version of the author as the book has little to do with the novel beyond the setting and basic premises) a soul who has lost her way in the bitter aftermath of divorce. The renewal she finds with the renovation of her new villa and friendships she establishes along the way makes for a rewarding and touching film experience.
The widescreen anamorphic transfer looks lovely capturing all the crisp, bright colors of Italy. There's no analog artifacts whatsoever and virtually no edge enhancement problems. ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" has been lovingly transferred from film to video without any of the usual analog to digital problems. The sound mix is as warm and sunny as the Italian landscape. While the 5.1 sound isn't used as successfully as say, an action picture, there's plenty of subtle detail to be heard and appreciated. The feeling of Italy envelops the listener with this carefully prepared transfer.
There are the usual deleted scenes, some of which add a bit of additional character touches. The making of featurette ""Tuscany 101"" provides a nice glimpse into the production and thought process of the writer/director Audrey Wells and her star. There are also cast and filmmaker interviews and a glimpse into some of the challenges and rewards of shooting in Italy.
Writer/director Audrey Wells provides an insightful and informative commentary track. It's a pity that Diane Lane and some of the Italian actors weren't included in the process. It would have been very interesting to get the Italian actors take on an American romantic comedy.
A delightful and touching film, ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" will provide an evening of great entertainment. Diane Lane is, as usual, marvelous in the lead performance.

As Mayes discovered, Italy was most unlike her home in San Francisco and the Italian people she met did not share many of her values.  The fun of the book was watching Mayes adapt to her new home and neighbors.
I thought, mistakenly as it turns out, that the Hollywood film of her book would be faithful, at least in part, to her experiences in Italy.  Unfortunatley, I was unable to recognize much of her original story in the Hollywood version of the book.
In Amazon's spotlight review for this movie, Samuel McKewon does an excellent job in his critique of the film and I will not repeat any of his comments.  I agree with McKewon even if most readers of his review do not.
The book and movie are called ""Under the Tuscan Sun.""  We have some right to expect that Tuscany will play an important part in the film.  Not so.  The film opens with Mayes, played by Diane Lane, losing much of her property in a painful divorce.  We are led to believe she is left with little money to begin her new life.  We will find out that we are wrong in this inference.
Mayes' friends give her a first class ticket to Tuscany. When she arrives, she leaves her tour almost immediately to purchase a run down villa in Cortina owned by an old contessa.  The contessa drives a hard bargain, too steep for the Italian couple who compete with Mayes to buy the place.  While Mayes herself is bargaining unsuccessfully with the contessa, a pidgeon defecates on her head.  This is a sign for the contessa that Mayes should be the new owner of her 300 year old villa.  This incident with the pidgeon is a warning to the viewer that the film is about to go into the toilet.
When Mayes buys the house it is badly run down so she hires an old Italian carpenter and his three Polish assistants to rebuild the villa.  A year later the three Polish workmen are still attempting to finish their repairs.  Where Mayes got the money to buy the villa and pay three workmen for a year to do repairs is a mystery left unsolved.  In fact, the only part the villa and workmen play in the story is as comic relief.  Instead, we watch Mayes attempt to bring romance and love back into her life.  For an intelligent, sophisticated women, she seems to be incredibly inept and immature.
In the book the story of her adventures rebuilding her villa had a charm sadly missing in the film, which turned out to be a soap opera of her lovelife among the Italians.  Instead of buying the film, viewers are advised to save their money and invest instead in the much cheaper paperback book.  Here they will find the real Frances Mayes meeting and learning to love her new Italian neigbors.",1076025600,,2862,4.446360153256705

But after all i do give 100% A+ for the acting and the brief sex and pregnancy and everything else that happens. And they don't make fun of the Gay community durring certain scenes with Diane in the Gay Tuscany tour group. very well done and if i was a girl i'd fall for the Italian dude too. but I'm a guy.

1954212,4,B0000VD02E,"Frances (Lane) is a writter who makes a living as a book critic. She finds out the hard way that her husband is having an affair and gets a divorce, although she ends up losing her house to her ex (he 'pays' her for about half of it), so she decides to follow a friend Patti's advice (Oh) and travel to Tuscany. While visiting the little town of Cortona, Frances has a ""terrible idea"" and decides to buy a Villa.
The Villa needs a lot of repairs and Francesca (as the locals start calling her) hires a band of misfit Polish workers. As time passes and work on her Villa goes on, Frances' life changes completely. She gets absorbed by the ""Italian"" way of life - not worrying so much about everything, enjoying life and not lingering on sad memories.
This is a fine romantic comedy. Perhaps one of the best of the last couple of years. It's a shame that it wasn't noticed by more people (it's box office was barely over 43MM). Diane Lane shines in her role and Sandra Oh is really funny in the few moments she gets (she is the scene stealer of the film). The rest of the characters are perfectly cast with what I'm assuming to be European actors.
But the one thing that makes this movie worth watching (I could go so far as to say owning, but nah!) are the gorgeous Tuscan landscapes. The beautiful little towns, the fabulous Villas, the pebble paved streets, the beautiful flower covered fields. There's also the little town by the sea where Marcello (Frances' love interest) lives. Unfortunately I didn't catch the name, otherwise I'd be taking a plane there right this moment. Keep an eye of cinematographer Geoffrey Simpson (Shine, Little women), because he shot a gorgeous looking movie.
The only downside I found is that there's a couple of scenes in which the movies turns to magical realism. I didn't feel those scenes fit with the rest of the movie. Maybe it's just me.",1075766400,9,1877,4.507331378299121

The main actor nervously grimaces her way through the film, struggling to portray the appropriate level of smug, self-congratulatory self-pity the worthless character and script call for. I'm sure the book was bad, but it can't have been this bad! The camera is permanently fitted with a vomit-yellow ""Tuscan"" lense filter (perhaps the Tuscan sun wasn't Tuscan enough?), which they forgot to remove when the scene shifts to Rome and (how imaginative!) the Amalfi coast.

The transformation of the brokendown house into a warm home is inspiring to anyone who has tried their hands at just such a task.
Her passion for food, friends, and romantic love is obvious and attractive.

Lane plays an endearing main character who would cling to the old and society's definition of what she as a 30 something should have in her life at this time.  By opening herself up to the novelty of life, her life unfolds in ways she doesn't expect (or even like at the time).
The movie has a flow that keeps the viewer interested.  The other characters play an inportant role in supporting the main character's mission to re-discover her life.  The backdrop of Italy certainly heightened the romance of the movie.  I didn't want the movie to end.
At the end, the viewer is left with an invitation to not take things for granted and at the same time to shed those things in life that are stale and/or not working....and move on to accomplishing dreams that may have been sitting on the shelf.

Their involvement in the refurbishment of an historic villa (honor the past and serve the needs of the present?) allows us to see their common humanity and presents us with whole people, not charicatures.

1954253,4,B0000VD02E,"This film is about a suddenly divorced woman who ends up touring Italy with a group of gay men. The build up to this amusing tour is very creative, also the many antics on the tour bus were funny, due to the ironical fact that a single divorced female was on tour with a group of men - all of whom were gay. It is an amusing, down-right funny film in many ways. It is also an inexpensive way to see the landscapes of Tuscany.

Starting a new life in Italy, on a whim, a spur of the moment, the need to escape, escape to another country, escape anywhere, is a fantasy, many people may have, especially if the people are divorced. The adventures of living in another country along with recovering one's sense of balance in life is the well developed topic of this film.

The tour bus stops in a town and our heroine sees an old home for sale in the picture window of a real estate office. It happens the tour passes by this very same home  and to the surprise of all, our protaganist asks the bus driver to stop. She enters the house and discovers a young European couple negotiating on the selling price with the owner, who is a widow, and her solicitor. Everytime the European couple offers a bid, the widow raises the price of the house. When our divorcee makes an offer ... the widow accepts it. The Europeann couple stalk off, complaining about how the rich Americans want to own everything.

Our divorcee admits to the widow, she can not afford the price she agreed to. The widow shakes her head, sadly, ""no"". The widow states through an interpreter, the solicitor, that she must have a sign from G-d before she can sell the house, right after that, a bird flies in and leaves a parting gift on our divorcee's head. The widow is happy and smiles ... that is the sign. It only gets better from there ... This is hugely funny film, reminds me of the movies made in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

1954287,4,B0000VD02E,"Following a divorce in which she loses her shirt due to California's community property laws, Frances Mayes, an author and book reviewer, goes on a trip to Cortona, Italy, where she ends up buying Bramasole, an ancient villa from a countess and sets about rebuilding the ruins of her life amid the beautiful countryside.  Her thoughts are voiced through a voiceover narrative, in which her wry wit comes through.
Much of her interractions come through with the restoration of the villa, which she decides to undergo after a fierce thunderstorm on her first evening there.  The repair work undergone there presents some comic moments, as well as triumphant ones.  There are three Polish workers she enlists, one into books, one who is clearly smitten by her, and Pavel, a blonde youth who falls for Chiara, the daughter of the family next door.  Frances befriends Pavel, even to the point of sticking up for him when Chiara's parents find out about their the young couple's liaison.
Then there's her friend Patty, an Oriental lesbian who's very pregnant and is planning to raise the baby with her partner.  She is the sole representative of her earlier life, and her appearance in the villa signifies that one can't completely break away from one's roots.  That concept is also demonstrated by an old man who keeps putting flowers at a stone shrine across her.  She waves at him but he refuses to return her gesture, merely staring at her with his sad, broken-hearted face which, like Frances, made me wonder what his story was.
However, the most interesting one is Katherine, a blonde English expatriot dressed in black, with a penchant for wide brimmed hats and eating ice-cream cones.  She is a direct contrast to Frances, savouring life, even modelling semi-nude for an Italian studmuffin named Zeus.
Two ideas come through in this movie.  One is something that Katherine tells Frances, never to lose your childhood innocence, something told her long ago by Fifi, a.k.a. Federico Fellini.  There's a nod to Silvia's fountain scene from La Dolce Vita involving her.
The other is things falling into place even though the circumstances aren't right.  In a moment of unsurety, Frances's wish to one day have a family and wedding in a villa she wonders if she should have bought, is given an analogy by Martini, her real estate agent, who tells her of a railway build between the place and Vienna even there were no trains built in Italy.  Eventually, the trains were built and were ready for the railway.  Still another analogy is the story Katherine tells of hunting high and low for ladybugs.  Tired, she fell asleep on the grass, and upon waking up, found herself covered with them.
The scenery is a panoply of beauty, be it the sparkling blue Mediterranean, the fields of red flowers, or the white-columned buildings in the city.  Diane Lane is a marvel as Frances, expressive in moments of hurt, doubt, and of course sheer joy, especially when she scores for the first time since her divorce.  She even has a nice bemused laugh that charmed me, and her playing a character I wanted to root for through her trials.  And she looks stunning in that white dress.  I see a Best Actress nomination here.  However, Lindsay Duncan steals the movie as Katherine, and despite her limited screen time, is certainly a character to watch.  Best Supporting Actress maybe?
And Vincent Riotta lends strong support as the reserved but sympathetic Martini.  Movies comparable to this include A Room With A View and Enchanted April, on finding oneself and following one's dreams even in the face of emotional disaster, so don't automatically stick this with the ""chick flick"" label.

1954289,2,B0000VD02E,"I'd call this a ""chick flick,"" but that's insulting to women on at least two levels -- the term and to suggest that women as a group would find this collection of hoary cinematic cliches the least bit interesting.  The true stars of the movie are the Italian countryside, wonderfully photographed in all seasons, and the house, but basically this is one of those Home and Garden TV fixer upper shows with a multi-million dollar budget.  Diane Lane is supposed to be a tough, unsentimental reviewer whose barbed jibes stay with authors for years.  This hardly tracks with her character, who immediately falls for any pretty, vacant, younger male face who wanders into her field of vision, and then is shocked, SHOCKED (Casablanca-style) when she turns out to be a mere dalliance for him.  Also from the cliche mill -- the plucky lesbian, Asian for diversity interest, who has been abandoned mid-pregnancy by her lover and heads off to Tuscany to have her baby (Sandra Oh does get the one really funny line in the movie, however, when a toilet bubbles over with hot water and she observes that it's really useful if you want to ""give your butt a facial.""); the handsome middle-aged Italian who has ""never cheated on my wife,"" but always turns up without her and with sage advice; and finally the old, eccentric Englishwoman, long-time resident of the town who is fond of nuzzling ducklings against her cheek in the farmers' market (Lane's character finds this fascinating), poses nude for her younger painter lovers, and dances drunk in fountains like a Fellini character.
To all of this many others reviewing here apparently say ""terrific.""  This dissenting view says, ""Ugh.""",1066694400,13,1674,4.901060070671378
1954290,4,B0000VD02E,"UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by Frances Mayes, is one of those fantasies of escape likely to appeal to those leading lives of quiet desperation.
Diane Lane plays Frances, who's just undergone a bitter divorce made more insulting by the fact that ex-hubbie buys out her share of the house using money supplied by his new woman. Frances moves into an apartment block that specializes in sheltering the recently divorced. The lawyer next door sobs a lot. Then, two of Frances's lesbian friends gift her with a ticket for a tour of Tuscany. So, off she goes, ultimately to impulsively purchase a run-down villa in the hill town of Cortona.  Mayes spends the rest of the story overseeing the restoration of her new digs by a local contractor employing three expatriate Poles, and searching for a new lease on Love.
My wife liked this film more than I, but admitted it's a chick flick. I'm giving it four stars chiefly because both Diane Lane and the Italian locations are gorgeous. The whole point of the film is to get the demoralized Frances to the point where she can again say, ""I'm emotionally OK and ready to boogie."" A disclaimer in the ending credits states that some characters were altered to enhance the dramatic action. Perhaps buffed up too much in some cases, and not enough in others.
For me, the film would have been a much better story had it focused on Frances, the villa's reconstruction, and the engaging personalities of the Poles (Pawel Szajda, Valentine Pelka, and Sasa Vulicevic), and created a relationship with her helpful real estate agent, the sensitive and maturely handsome Martini (Vincent Riotta). However, the screenwriters have Frances involved in too many other subplots requiring an excess of supporting players. There's Katherine (Lindsay Duncan), a flamboyant ex-actress and Fellini protege, who's only purpose in the storyline seems to be to dance in a fountain and advise on how to find men, in this case equated with ladybugs  - essentially, ""lie down in the grass and let them come to you"". Then there's gay pal Patti (Sandra Oh), who shows up to have a baby. And hunky Marcello (Raoul Bova), straight off the lurid cover of some bodice-ripper, who admittedly goes a long way in restoring Mayes's sexual self-esteem. (My wife thought Marcello totally necessary to the plot.) Indeed, one of the best scenes has Mayes doing a private victory dance to celebrate the fact that she's still ""got it.""
Diane Lane's last outing (UNFAITHFUL) garnered her a well-deserved Oscar nomination. Her role in UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN is nowhere near to being as accomplished a performance. But for this viewer, who's been in love with Ms. Lane since her appearance in 1989's LONESOME DOVE as the sweetly vulnerable prostitute Lorena, it more than sufficed as an endorphin fix.",1066435200,9,2832,4.885654885654886

1954293,2,B0000VD02E,"Suffering a rank case of postmodern personality disorder - dead split between traditional and avant-garde mores - ""Under The Tuscan Sun"" seeks to embrace its main character, a divorced writer reinventing her life along with a villa in the Italian hills, and then poke fun at her, doling out equal amounts of ladybugs and Fellini. It plays a basic genre con, pretending to be a Travel Picture while its main trade is the same movie-of-the-week dramatics Lisa Hartman has been gnashing her teeth over for years.
Diane Lane, in an apology for her brave, sexy performance in ""Unfaithful,"" is Frances Mayes, jilted and unmoored on a gay tour of Italy (set up by her gay friend, played by Sandra Oh) while writing esteemed lines on postcards such as ""ding, dang, dong, the bell rang"" and stumbling upon a house and garden ripe for remodeling, and her entire bank account.
Writer/director Audrey Wells doesn't particularly consider this villa with her camera; we get glimpses of rooms, a concept of the garden, but Lane never presented in anything but regal close-up. There are obligatory, Remember-It's-Tuscany helicopter shots, but the movie's two most impressive visuals - a sunset on the beach and Florence at dawn - are special f/x, blue screen manipulations. Shameless.
But Wells isn't out for an American version of ""Enchanted April."" She is, however, offering the full tour of women's issues: divorce (in her book by the same name, Mayes refurbishes the villa with her husband), pregnancy, forbidden young love, sex, kind married men, swarthy younger men, silent older men who leave flowers at alters for no apparent reason, and finally, famous movie directors, say Federico Fellini, who apparently thought a great deal of all things child - enthusiasm, innocence, naivete, stupidity. Fellini is dead, but his wisdom is channeled through a goofy blonde bombshell who poses nude for a painting one afternoon while drinking tea with nuns the next morning.
There are dreams about white dresses, mewling kitties (did Wells mistake Fellini for Luis Bunuel?) flag-tossing expeditions, days in the olive fields, thunderstorms, snakes, signs from God via pigeons and a motorcycle ride through a seaside resort. The motorcycle ride, featuring Lane done up to the nines, is a particularly odd scene, considering the joke laid at Frances' feet by the end of that ride.
But ""Under The Tuscan Sun"" is full of such contrasts, vesting in Frances' want to have and find love, then exposing the quest as fraud, as if to be a grind of feminist theory Frances must survive before passing out the other side and meeting a servile, unworthy guy in the movie's final five minutes - literally - as if that God of thunderstorms and ladybugs sent him through Tuscany as reward.
Lane is appealing and gorgeous but she mugs as badly as Meg Ryan on Theatre Sunday; her face pops and seethes and scowls and explodes in happiness and, quite often, settles on a bizarre, quizzical frown unbecoming of a woman in her late thirties, who should have figured a few things out by now. Frances is written as vulnerable, and Lane hits that mark with an obviousness that's meant to be funny; at times it works, at others Lane just shambles around. Yes, she's capable enough of opening and carrying a movie, if that was the point, but Lane need not play a half-witted fourth fiddle in Julia Roberts country just to avoid the tagalong role in Keanu Reeves sports films.
For Wells, who had wrote ""The Truth About Cats and Dogs"" and ""Guinevere,"" the failure is not surprising: Frankly, she's skilled in relationship territory, hapless otherwise. ""Under The Tuscan Sun"" mines the same ridiculous ""in a foreign land, everyone's a kook!"" material beaten to pulp - in fact, Europeans are not half as juiced up and loud as Americans - while teaching its lesson on What Women Should Want.
Bizarre, right-angled stuff like recreating the fountain scene from Fellini's ""La Dolce Vita"" speaks to Wells' arrogance and true aim - only a small portion of the audience, and hardly anyone under forty, will have the foggiest idea what that scene is, or was, about. Whether it was a pander to the arthouse crowd or a tack at smartening up the target audience, it's an ugly bit of filmmaking in a picture full of nose-cutting and face-spiting.",1066089600,77,4285,4.911724137931034

1954319,4,B0000VD02E,"This is simply one of the best examples ever of a genre I like to call ""kissy-face,"" nothing negative implied!
There comes a time when you just want to see a film where there is no violence, no blood, no horror, no significant meaning--just pure, decadent entertainment. That's what ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is like--a wonderful box of chocolates where every chocolate is your favorite flavor. Some call this genre ""chick flicks""--so be it.
The story is pure, simple fluff, and not even original at that. Diane Lane (perfect in the role) plays a scorned woman, not too young, but far from old, who purchases a broken-down villa in Tuscany, Italy, on pure whim. Does it make sense? No! Is it perfectly believable? Yes! As she sets out to save the villa from utter ruin and turn it into a liveable residence, she finds herself involved with a crazy group of Polish emigrants, who not only speak poor English, but poor Italian as well. They have been hired to remodel the villa.
Then there's a crazy but fabulous real estate woman who fancies herself a character in a Fellini movie--and then some. Our heroine has definitely bitten off more than she can chew, but at least she doesn't have much time to think of the cad back home who dumped her. So does she find true love and live happily ever after? I won't tell you, but the lush, gorgeous, breathtaking panorama of Tuscany is worth the price of the movie no matter what the plot--and the plot is just icing on the cake.
It isn't ""smart,"" it isn't intellectual, it doesn't have much of a plot, it makes no sense at all--but ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is just perfect.",1065571200,8,1611,4.558620689655172

1954355,3,B0000VD02E,"The concept that formed the basis of Frances Mayes' acclaimed memoir UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN has been used as a starting point for the development of the storyline for this film. However, this movie is a wonderful illustration of the difficulties of fashioning a film with wide box office appeal from a fascinating book with a devoted but limited audience. I have not read the book but apparently its lyrical and captivating descriptions of Frances' experiences in purchasing and renovating Bramasole, a rundown Italian villa, and of her enjoyment of life in the Italian countryside led the producers to want to capture those experiences on film. However, they decided that they needed more of a story in order to engage the audience, and settled on a backdrop of failed romance contrasted with the enthusiasm of young love as a means of keeping the audience engaged for this almost two hour film. The result is an enjoyable story, some wonderful scenery, several funny lines and incidents but no truly uproarious comedy, a marvelous performance by Diane Lane, but also a relatively formulaic story that never veers too far from the predictable. Yet while attempting to provide feelgood endings for all the various threads of the story, it does fail however to answer the mystery regarding the old man with flowers.

The movie casts Frances as a frustrated writer whose professional existence is as a book reviewer, and this persona is important to the storyline  both at the start and also at the contrived conclusion of the film. She becomes despondent when she learns that her husband is having an affair and wants a divorce, and this film traces her progress through the various stages of her emotional journey. It then utilizes the technique of her deciding to live in and renovate an Italian villa which she stumbles upon during a trip to Italy (arranged by her concerned friends) as the source of her eventual catharsis and reaffirmation of life. Her best friend Patti (Sandra Oh) unexpectedly joins Frances in Italy during Patti's final stages of pregnancy when she is deserted by her lesbian lover, and there are romantic episodes involving Frances which provide counterpoint to the budding romance between a young man who is a member of the Polish crew renovating her new home and the daughter of the neighboring Italian family. Finally, there is Katherine (Lindsay Duncan) an intriguing Englishwoman who settled in Italy years ago following a teenage encounter with FE FE (known to the rest of us as Frederico Fellini) that left an indelible impression on her life.

While all this is enjoyable, due to the fact that the plot was grafted onto a very different type of book the movie simply wanders towards its eventual conclusion without any real suspense or passion. While I am sure that many filmgoers will differ, I would have it preferred that it contain either more realism or at the other extreme be a much more straightforward character study with some elements of suspense, unfortunately we got neither. (Personally, I had hoped for an Italian version of  THIS OLD TUSCAN HOUSE with a Bob Vila equivalent giving some serious insights into such a project intertwined with a believable storyline.) Instead, the renovation project itself was used mostly to generate laughs. Thus, despite the film being well made and enjoyable, I cannot rate it more than three stars since I have no desire to either watch it again in the immediate future or to own the DVD. However, when you want light entertainment, and especially if you are a Diane Lane fan or want to see a performance by an actress who gets the most out of her material, you should see this film. Just don't set your expectations too high.

1954356,5,B0000VD02E,"I loved this film.  I loved the book.  I love Italy!
I read Francis Mayes book Under the Tuscan Sun just before I went to Italy the first time in 1997.  I've been back several times since.  I can't help it.  The country and the people draw me back.  I can relate to Mayes need for a home there.  When I first heard of a movie being made based on the book, I anxiously awaited its release.  Even knowing that there would be creative license used to relate the book to film, I was never worried about the outcome.  I knew it would be a beautiful film.  I'm not disappointed.
Some of the situations and set up have changed to suit the film format, but these were all done well.  What remains is the essence of the book.  The essence of Italy.  How it makes you fall in love with history.  How it makes you fall in love with simple and flavorful food.  How it makes you fall in love with the beautiful Italian people.  How it makes you fall in love with the beautiful countryside and rolling hills filled with olives and grapes.
They've attached a simple story line to the movie, but its roots go much deeper.  Watch it for the good romantic movie that it is, but look closer.  Listen to the words.  See the people, old and young that move through the story.  Look at the scenery.  It really does look like that.  Everywhere.  Read the book and go see the movie again.

Diane Lane acted brilliantly and gives another Oscar worthy performance. The supporting cast were very amusing. The scenery was perhaps the most beautiful I have seen in a feature film.

1954381,4,B0000VD02E,"What starts out as an Italian ""Money Pit"" with all the attendant broken pipes, crumbling walls and incompetent handymen makes a turn for the better about a third of the way through: a more emotionally centered and revealing movie,""Under the Tuscan Sun.""
The luminescent Diane Lane stars as Frances, an intelligent, loving women with close and committed friends who finds herself in a situation that many people do: with a mate who has fallen out of love, wants a divorce as well as possession of a much loved and painstakingly renovated house, this one in San Francisco. After the divorce Frances goes to Tuscany on a lark, falls in love with a villa there, buys it and proceeds to renovate it. The villa then is the physical manifestation of the shedding of her old life and marriage and the hope for the renovation and rehabilitation of her love life as well as her life in general.
That she probably places too much faith in the physical to solve the emotional does not detract at all from the guts and hope that it takes to do so. And Lane is so psychically centered and open as Frances that you cannot help but be moved by her situation.
There are some silly plot lines and performances that I wish weren't, but with a central performance as attractive and genuinely loving and feminine as Lane's, ""Under The Tuscan Sun"" is as warm and inviting as bread just out of the oven.",1064880000,72,1380,4.568548387096774

1954383,5,B0000VD02E,"""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is a beautifully filmed, charming, heartfelt and wise film with a delightful script and a tour de force performance by the lovely Diane Lane.  I went into this film with very low expectations, boy am I sick of the continuous stream of worthless romantic drivel Hollywood has been turning out lately.  This one is different, folks.  It has something that most films don't: heart.
A successful and happily married San Francisco writer, Frances Mayes, life turns upside down when she discovers that her husband is cheating on her and gets a divorce.  Heartbroken, depressed, and suffering from writer's block, her best friend Patti convinces her to take a vacation to Italy.  Acting on a surge of spontaneity, Frances purchases a beautiful yet run-down villa in Tuscany.
The script, based on the book of the same name, is just wonderful.  It flows in a beautiful way and the voice-overs by Frances are lyrical and poetic.  The story is full of realistic and fascinating characters, humor, heart, and, of course, the beautiful Tuscan scenery.  The thing I most love about this film (and there are many things to love) is its poignant examination of human vulnerability, relationships, love and loss.

1954385,4,B0000VD02E,"Welcome to Tuscany - a region of Italy known for its breathtaking old-world scenery, charming people, and the plumpest grapes, which are used to produce the finest bouquet of wines this side of Napa Valley. This is also the place where a recently divorced, down on her luck writer, Frances (Diane Lane) retreats (at the request of friends) to begin a life anew, free from her recent setback...or so Frances thought. Our young writer's problems really begin to take shape as soon as she purchases a 300 year old house, located on the edge of a fairly modest village in the Tuscan countryside. Once settled in, Frances finds that she gets more than she bargained for, including a relationship with a suave, handsome Italian corner store owner (Raoul Bova). Frances' relationship with this attracive young individual is one of the most touching moments of ""Under The Tuscan Sun"". Sandra Oh gives a rather dramatic performance as Frances' best friend, who, is as surprised and as shocked as anyone, when she learns of Frances' decision that she has bought an old, broken down slum of a dilapidated heap of a house, therefore wondering if Frances' brain was on autopilot when making such a spur-of-the-moment decision! Ah, but as is sometimes the case, there is indeed a silver lining tucked beneath this ominously dark cloud, for our temporarliy displaced writer does not travel this journey alone. Also along on this Tuscan sojourn, are a family of Polish immigrants (who work cheaply and dilgently in struggling to get the house in order), as well as a worldly English woman (who, like Eric Idle's character in ""National Lampoon's European Vacation"", pops up unexpectedly). There are also other living things on this journey as well - in the form of arachnids and slimey reptiles. Blecch! With so much taking place in its two hours of undisputed mayhem and glory, ""Under The Tuscan Sun"" combines the melodrama of a soap opera, with the wit and wisdom of an intellectual novel (upon which this picture is based). You'll need a handkerchief handy while sitting through some of this film's most touching moments. Like Tuscany's many winding pathways contained in many of its villages, there's always a maze of adventure and excitement just waiting ""under the sun"". Reserve your ticket (at a bargain basement price) at a theater near you soon...that is, while supplies last! Oh, and the Tuscan cuisine is mouth-watering, too.",1064793600,,2419,4.9753086419753085

Lane--in her first film as the sole over-the-title star--gives her usual lovely, fresh and graceful performance in a genial and charming film. Mayes gave writer-director Audrey Wells total permission to create a plot where the original book had none; while Wells plays fast and free with the details of Mayes' life (for example, Mayes already had a second husband when she bought Bramasole), Mayes certainly doesn't seem to mind, so we shouldn't either. Wells' plot has a lot of humor, a little heartbreak, a wisecracking lesbian best friend (Sandra Oh), a flamboyant English actress (Lindsay Duncan), an enigmatic old man (Mario Monicelli), and a pair of incredibly adorable teenage lovers, along with a childbirth, fields of glowing sunflowers and many sumptuous Italian meals. Basically, ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is a charming, pretty movie about charming, pretty people doing charming, pretty things. That doesn't make a masterpiece, but it does make an extremely pleasant way to pass two hours. (Note: Lindsay Duncan also appeared in the TV version of ""A Year in Provence.""
