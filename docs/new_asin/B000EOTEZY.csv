8112061,5,B000EOTEZY,Nicely chaptered this advanced workout provides a nice variety for cardio. You can easily mix and match to create longer or shorter workouts. The sections are very challenging. Mindy cues well and is in top shape herself. Very inspiring.,1233273600,,237,5.102564102564102
8112062,5,B000EOTEZY,"I've never done a Mindy Mylrea workout before but I knew she's meant to be very good and with a good reputation, so I gave this a shot.  I'm glad I did.  It is excellent.

There are four 15 minute segments and each is a little different than the others.  You need a step for the first three segments - there are moves done here that I've not done on the step before; soccer dribbles and slalom type moves.  This makes it really interesting and fun.  Then the last segment is a floor workout that's supposed to be a mixed low and high impact workout, yet it's kind of more high than low.

Mindy's technique, form and cuing is top notch and based on this routine, I'm willing to try all her other workouts.  It's about 80 minutes long and well worth every penny.",1146614400,9,760,4.229166666666667
