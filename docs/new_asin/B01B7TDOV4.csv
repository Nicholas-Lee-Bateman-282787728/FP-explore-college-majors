8749537,5,B01B7TDOV4,"Series 1 & 2 follows the same storyline. Direction faultless in this powerful light shone on crime amongst Britain's the poor.
Susan Lancashire a tough police sergeant deals with a series of interlinked harrowing crimes. Unfortunately, series 2 ends with the impression that series 3 will continue with the same villain.  Therefore, I will not buy any further series. A shame because the supporting cast has been well drawn and I'd be keen to buy more if it addressed a different storyline than the one that served so well over two series.",1535673600,,539,4.858695652173913
