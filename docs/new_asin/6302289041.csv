It holds a special place in my heart as I was attending UNT at the time this movie was made and actually got autographs from Scott Bakula, Kathy Ireland, and Hector Elizondo. I have a dear friend who was also attending UNT at the time and still attends (if you can believe it! But hey, Denton is weird/good like that) who also has a signed poster from Kathy Ireland.

Just a fun college football film made at a time when the SMU scandal of the late 80s was still very fresh in everyone's mind.",1491091200,,522,4.2727272727272725

This movie may have been lower budget and never saw a theater, but you can see its direct inspiration for ""The Replacements"" that came out a few years later.

Bakula, as always, turned out an excellent performance.  Sinbad was...Sinbad.  Funny as ever.  Kathy Ireland was still quite young and attractive and hungry to launch a movie career.  The football scenes were well done, the characters were well written, and Rob Schneider did some of the best sports announcer lines I've ever heard in a movie.",1437955200,,659,4.533898305084746

450305,2,6302289041,"Texas State University has just won the National Championship, but they did so by cheating. The team has been expelled and the coaches have been fired, meaning the upcoming seasons will have to feature a has been coach and a team of walk-ons. The new team will include a 37 year old quarterback, a wide receiver who can't catch a cold, a science teacher at linebacker, and a female kicker. Sports comedies require a very delicate balance to avoid leaning one way or the other, and on both sides, Necessary Roughness fails to deliver. This film really isn't that funny and the team just sucks, making for a painfully predictable experience. While featuring one of the greatest motivational locker room speeches of all time, the film really doesn't have much else going for it. Scott Bakula stars and tries his best to make the story believable, but it just isn't, and when you add Sinbad and Katy Ireland to the mix, it just makes for a very uneven film. For something like this to work, it has be raunchy and way out there, hysterical with a completely unforeseen ending, similar to Major League. This film has none of it, as the jokes are all at a fifth grade level and the on-field action isn't at all believable. I love a good sports movie and Scott Bakula can be terrific in the right role, I wanted to like this movie, but it just seemed to never end, a sure sign that the film fails to entertain or inspire.",1423440000,,1413,4.501945525291829

450308,4,6302289041,"NECESSARY ROUGHNESS (the original 1991 version) is a semi-cute college football comedy that's more a sports-set drama with comedic touches. Its heartiest chuckle belongs to Rob Schneider, who plays the Texas State U. Armadillos' in-stadium announcer.

Waggish Schneider gently mocks the team's disastrous games (more on this shortly) for a home stadium crowd of literally dozens. The best of his bon mots occurs when a 'Dillo player turns ninja and kicks three or four opponents to the turf. Schneider laments: ""Ohhhhhh! There's a flag.... I can't imagine why. That was a clean kick to the face mask.""

The schnook of this story is Dean Philip Elias (Larry Miller), a beady-eyed education elitist who does everything he can to end TSU's football program, even though they were division champs last year. First Elias finds reasons to suspend all returning players. Undaunted, Coach Ed Gennero (Hector Elizondo) holds open try-outs and manages to assemble a team of mostly non-athletes, plus a 34-year-old freshman QB (Scott Bakula) and a graduate student teaching assistant (Sinbad). Again Dean Elias strikes, booting several newbies for poor classroom grades. With only 17 men available, Coach Gennero announces the Armadillos will play Iron Man football, that is, both offense and defense.

After the 'Dillos get smoked in their season opener, a gleeful Elias offers to ""help"" by arranging a practice scrimmage with men from ""a State facility."" Thus, a dingy gray bus rolls in from the nearby penitentiary. Emerging from it are a scary bunch of convicts, all in grimy dark gray prison sweats. This squad is portrayed by boxer Evander Holyfield, plus these NFL greats: Dick Butkus, Earl Campbell, Roger Craig, Ben Davidson, Tony Dorsett, Ed 'Too Tall' Jones, Jim Kelly, Jerry Rice, Herschel Walker, and Randy Wright. Predictably, they throw an immediate beating on the hapless 'Dillos while Elias snickers from behind a wall. It's the best sequence in the film, but all-too brief.

The Armadillos aren't ""going for it all"" here. To them, a 3-3 tie in a torrential downpour is a moral victory, for it circumvents an 0 and 10 season. Winning the year's final contest, which is against the division's best team, just seems impossible for the battered but proud TSU Armadillos.

As with most pictures of this type, on-field action will please any gridiron fan. A fast-paced but formulaic plot is the main weakness of what is still a pleasant 90 minute diversion.

Supporting cast includes Kathy Ireland as the first female in NCAA football history (she's the kicker), also Robert Loggia as Gennero's long-time assistant coach, plus minor roles for Fred Thompson and Chris Berman (as himself).",1418342400,2,2688,5.1536697247706424

The movie follows a Texas University football team. The program use to be one of the best until they were caught doing some illegal things (illegal recruiting, free passes on grades ect). The whole team except one or two get kicked off the team. Hector Elizondo was asked to rebuild and from the new recruits, it looked like it was going to be a long football season. although no one was complaining when the coaches (Robert Loggia to be exact) recruits kathy Ireland; a soccer player to be the kicker.

The team doesn't ""win it all"" this time around.  They simply prove themselves to be legitimate against seemingly insurmountable odds, which lends credibility to the film, rather than having it play out like so many other sports movies.

This one, since it is not based on true events, takes a lot of liberties and has some improbable plot twists, but it has some genuinely funny moments and its cast seems up to its task of making it all seem believable.  Scott Bakula stars as a 34 year old farmer who missed his opportunity to go to college and play football when his father died and he opted to take over the business.  He is given a second chance when he is recruited by his former coach Robert Loggia.  Loggia and fellow coach Hector Elizondo have some fun moments, and Larry Miller is perfect as the football-hating obnoxious dean.

450551,4,6302289041,"Necessary Roughness came on the heels of the baseball film ""Major League"" and follows the same script formula of a group of misfits overcoming all odds and winning the big game.  Due to NCAA sanctions, the Texas State University Fightin' Armadillos must form a football team from their actual student body, with no scholarships to help, to play their football schedule. With fewer players than most teams, the makeshift team must overcome obstacles that the best teams in the country couldn't deal with. Using a 34 year old quarterback, a female placekicker and a gang of misfits, Ed ""Straight Arrow"" Genero (Hector Elizondo) must take his team to play the number one Texas Colts.

Scott Bakula plays Paul Blake...once a top recruited high school QB who never played college football is brought into lead the team who must play both offense and defense because they don't have enough players.  Sinbad plays Andre, a teacher at the college who also joins the team along with Jarvis (Jason Bateman) and a female kicker named Lucy (Kathy Ireland).

The Armadillos go out and get massacred in every game they play, much to the delight of the Dean (Larry Miller) who is no fan of athletics and wants to see the team fail.  At the end of the year they find themsevles having to face their state rivals and #1 ranked Texas Colts...the stereotypical team of bad guys you always find in movies like this.  Well you can probably guess who wins the game in the end.

Movies like this never come as a surprise.  You always know what's going to happen in the end and the joy is the ride getting there.  The team is suitably horrible with wide receivers who can't catch, and lineman who can't block and a coach who grows more frustrated with each practice.

Sinbad is always fun to see and brings his usual charm and infectious smile to his role and Bakula does a fine job as the team's ""old man"" QB leading a team of mostly young kids.  There's a pretty funny sequence where the coach brings in a group of convicts to scrimmage his team.  The Convicts are made up of former NFL greats Dick Butkus, Ben Davidson, Tony Dorsett, Jim Kelly, Randy White, and Herschel Walker.

Rob Schneider has a bit part as the Amadillos radio and PA announcer and ESPN's Chris Berman has a cameo.  This is actually one of the better movies of its type and a good diversion for a few laughs.",1106524800,9,2358,4.583333333333333

Coach Riggendorf is hilarious! (especially his halftime speech).  The interactions between Coach Riggendorf and Coach Geniero crack me up.  They have the funniest bunch of characters on their team (the fictitious Texas State Armadillos) including Andre Krimm (Sinbad), Manu-Manu the Slender, Samurai, Sgt. Wilkerson, McKenzie, the Twins, Paul Blake, Jason Bateman, Featherstone (a.k.a. Stonehands), Popkey, Charlie Banks, Lucy (Kathy Ireland), etc.  Rob Schneider is the announcer for the football games in this movie and he is hilarious!!  Some of his lines are classic!

Paul Blake (Scott Bakula) plays a former high school football star quarterback who never got the chance to play college football because he had to run the family farm.  Coach Riggendorf goes out and recruits Blake to come back from ""retirement"" and join the team.  After some convincing, Blake decides to come back and play quarterback for the Armadillos.  They end up having a rough season and lose pretty much every game.  The final game of the season arrives and they have to take on the #1 team in the state of Texas.  No one expects them to win, but they pull out the improbable victory at the end of the game.

450584,4,6302289041,"There are a number of films about the underdogs of the world. Most of them are comedies. Necessary Roughness is one of them. It's about how Texas State University lost its championship status due to cheating, steroids, pay-offs, etc. Therefore, the entire team was expelled from TSU. The new recruits had to be from the actual student-body. As coach Riggendorf (Robert Loggia) said, ""Mass suicide!"" The team is made up of a bunch of misfits and way-out individual characters. The president of TSU (Fred Dalton Thomson) wanted Ed ""Straight-Arrow"" Gennero (Hector Elindonzo) to lead the new team. But there's a catch. The dean (Larry Miller) will insist on applying strict rules; ie: ""No pass, no play."" (Referring to their grade-point-average) So a number of students try out for the team. A fair batch made it too. But since most of the players didn't make the grade, they were kicked of the team by the dean. That forced them to play what is called ""ironman football""; where the team plays both offensive and defensive. Not an easy feat.

Also, they needed a really good quarterback. So Coach Rigg enlisted Paul Blake (Scott Bakula), who was the best in high-school. Sadly, he had to give it up when his father passed away, to take over the family farm.

The TSU Armadillos begin some serious football playing against the other universities/colleges of their area. But with some hilarious commentary from Chuck Niederman (Rob Schneider) in the pressbooth.

They even manage to get a football player/science professor to join (Sinbad); as well as Lucy to be the place-kicker (Kathy Ireland).

All they want to achieve in football life is to win at least one game. Blake wants his fellow teammates to feel what he did in high school - just even that once.

450587,3,6302289041,"Necessary Roughness is a humorous film that's supposed to make us laugh and cheer for the underdog.  It has its parts, I admit, where it is good fun and it is enjoyable, but then it has its stupid, cliched parts that kinda ticks me off as a student of football.
Good points:
1) I think there's a good range of characters, each one has a different persona, thankfully.  Some of them are pretty enjoyable and even at times believable.  Especially the QB, an older guy going back to college to guide a losing team to a better record.  It's a storyline we can follow and his character is pretty fun to follow.
2) I like how this was about a losing team, a nobody school, that is trying to get a couple wins, not a championship under their belt.  If this had been a film about a nothing school going all the way, I would've given it one star.
3) This film has a solid plot, for a football film.  It has easy characters to follow and the objective of the film is clear.  Meaning, you know what it's about and it answers most the questions that might be raised during the film.
All right the bad things:
1) The dialogue of this film is so full of cliches and you can almost expect what each character is going to say because it is so scripted.  This really hurt the originality of this film, the complete originality of this film.
2) The romance is unnecessary and dumb.  It has nothing to do with the plot, it's just a side note that the QB is making out with his English prof.  I mean, who cares?  It's not as if she plays an important role and it isn't as if the romance is crucial to the development of characters.
3) The bar fight.  How predictable and stupid.  And naturally the team they fight over in the bar is the very same team they meet in the final game.  How cliche.
4) What I wanted to see was this aging QB to have to prove himself all over again, kind of work his way up and earn the confidence of his team members.  That would've added the element of emotion in this film, which lacks because you don't really care a whole bunch about any of the characters, they are just entertaining jocks.  Instead, he's accepted almost instantly and doesn't have to earn his starting job, it's granted to him.  Because everything is practically handed to him, all the oppertunities that is, how in the world can we possibly sympathize with his character?
5) A football film without emotion is a pretty boring film, if at best, a one time wonder and then it's dull.  Which is the problem with this film.  It's fun to watch the first time around, but after that, it's like who cares?  This film taught me nothing because I was never involved with the plot or any of the characters emotionally.  Again, it had good characters, but they weren't good enough to make this film better because they were all distant jocks.
If you are looking for a football film that's fun to watch one time, then watch this film.  But don't even think for a second you'll want to buy this film to watch again and again.  It's just not worth it.  It's an average sports film, with poor dialogue, and lack of creativity in development of characters.

Well, the characters are paper thin, and the dialogue should be familiar -- it features every cliche ever used in the history of sports movies. Still, there is some value is seeing Ireland on-screen, and Bakula is hard to dislike. Most memorable: Rob Schneider's hilarious calls from the pressbox (fumble...fumbleaya...fumblerooski).
