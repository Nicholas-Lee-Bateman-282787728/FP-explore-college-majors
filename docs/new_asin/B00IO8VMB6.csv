6283594,5,B00IO8VMB6,"Another of those four movie blu-ray offerings from the studios that bring you 4 blu-ray movies for the price of one usually.  In this case three mediocre films that hardly qualify as monster movies but are modern and entertaining in their way with Jack the Giant Slayer being the best of the 3 in my opinion 10,000 BC perhaps underrated and Cloverfield being just annoying and to me somewhat nauseating in all the shots from the first person cam perspective shimmying and shaking all over the place...BUT...with one all time 'classic' that has been lovingly restored and at the time of this review was priced much below the price of the single movie release...the original King Kong!  ( I checked as of today this offering is $17 something and the King Kong release is a dollar more so you still save a dollar and get three more movies you or the kids might like).

Bear in mind this is a four disc release with two discs on one spindle on either side.  They are the exact same discs released in the single releases and come with whatever extras were on the disc in the original release.  If the original release was two discs then you're not getting the second disc but only the disc containing the movie and whatever was on it to begin with.

That being said the double stacking is not detrimental to the discs and the package is way below the cost of the four films individually, and there are more sets where some of the collections are greatly worth the price (the four original Batman movies or The Lethal Weapon 4 movie collection for example...so do a little searching and you'll find them - just type in 'Four Film Favorites' in the search bar - because there's about ten sets in all...there's some DVD sets too that will pop up and bear in mind that other studios put out other sets of three or four so look around and do your homework here on Amazon and you'll find them!).

I'm happy with it and I recommend it.",1403481600,12,1923,4.461538461538462

8643876,5,B00IO8VMB6,"Bought it for King Kong which I have only skimmed through and find it to be quite good technically.  Cloverfield I already had in a single version which I like very much despite the shaky camera filming, a very scary film.  10,000 BC I haven't seen except for skimming through briefly.  BUT Jack the Giant Slayer, WOW, what a stupendous film.  From the very beginning to the suspenseful tense climactic scenes, what a great fantasy film.  Not just one giant or two or three, but a horde of hungry man-eating monsters.  The photography, the special effects are unbelievable!  For you home theater buffs, the surround is superlative from the very beginning to the end, directional sound is fantastic with all surrounds, even rear speakers pounding out a sensational story.  Subwoofers get a real good workout, too.  Definitely a disk to show off your sight and sound equipment.",1447200000,,875,4.8979591836734695

8643881,5,B00IO8VMB6,"With Netflix, Amazon Fire, and a slew of online streaming services now available for movies and television shows, the market for hard copies of movies is shrinking fast.  Disc makers have responded in two ways to keep buyers interested in buying actual DVD's and Blu-Rays.  First is the use of Director's cuts, alternate endings or openings, and extended editions that are available only on hard copy.  Second is the inclusion of previously unreleased footage, such as deleted scenes, cast interviews, and short films that are typical of Pixar movies.  Third is the combination of multiple films into one package at a discounted price than could be available if purchased separately.  This product is the latter, with four movies available in Blu-Ray format.  10,000 BC and Cloverfield are now found on Netflix streaming.  Jack the Giant Killer is a 2013 release that still has to find its way to Netflix, and is probably the best movie in the package.  But for many, the prize in this product is the original black-and-white King Kong.  This was the movie that started the mega-monster genre, and it is amazing.  Made before WWII during the height of the Great Depression, this movie is amazing.  Though the acting and dialogue would seem funny to modern audiences, the special effects, costume and set design, and stop-motion photography are amazing.  I would venture to say the action scenes and Kong's movements in this movie are more believable than the 1976 bomb starring Jeff Bridges.  And the transfer to Blu-Ray is amazing as the visual quality is perfect.  Overall, a good buy for the price, worth almost 8 hours of entertainment value.",1404172800,6,1646,4.981684981684982
