5391924,5,B00A73ANIY,There are days I cannot go without watching an episode of Matlock it is a daily regiment for me - good thing Matlock is on more than once a day.,1362873600,,144,3.8333333333333335
5391925,4,B00A73ANIY,"I grew up watching Matlock and always loved sitting down and watching the rational, reasonable man who solves murders. I do have to admit, some of the episodes are kind of silly. One of my favorite episodes is the ""Last Laugh"", guest starring Milton Berle. I can't wait for season 9, oh Walt-Mart has this season for 20 bucks.",1361318400,3,326,4.5423728813559325
5391926,5,B00A73ANIY,Very nice item. Would recommend this to others.  Pleased and can not wait to start watching it and sharing it with others.,1361232000,,122,4.545454545454546
5391927,5,B00A73ANIY,"Matlock is a wonderful courtroom drama that evokes many happy memories for me.  My cousin and I used to watch the show every time it was on, each of us providing our own speculations as to who was the culprit for each particular episode.  My cousin was always right and could have given Matlock a run for his money.
The eighth season of this show is one of the best.  This season features Matlock's daughter, Leann Mackintyre, his long-time enemy, Billy Lewis, and Billy's bumbling yet delightful investigator son, Cliff.  My favorite episodes in this season or as follows:

1.  ""The Play"": A hilareous episode in wich Ben has the lead role in a community play.  He is so terrible that the melodramatic director replaces him.  When the director is accused of murdering the leading lady in the cast, Ben is not above resorting to blackmail in order to win back his leading role.
2.  ""The Fatal Seduction"": A two part episode in which Ben travels home to Mount Harlan to attend the funeral of his high school sweetheart, Lucy.  While there, he becomes embroiled in a case involving extortion, murder and two femme fatales determined to get what they want no matter the cost.
3.  ""The Diner"": A heartwarming episode in which Ben relates the story of his first case, his defense of a black man accused of murdering the town's prejudiced sheriff.
4.  ""Matlock's Bad, Bad Dream"": A funny episode in which Matlock travels back in time to the 1930's and defends a club owner with a familiar face.  Other suspects also bear strange resemblances to familiar people.  Is it just a dream or something worse?
5.  ""The Thief"": Matlock directs his congregation's choir when the director goes on a trip.  One of the members, a college professor with a love for rare books, is accused of murder.  This is a very touching episode; one in which I felt empathy for the culprit.
6.  ""The Idol"": A young lawyer who adopts many of Ben's methods is accused of murder after returning from a cruise to St. Thomas.

These are just a few examples of the delights that await you in this wonderful collection.  The best part of this season is seeing the minuscule ways in which the perpetrators entrap themselves.  Also, Matlock's courtroom antics are priceless.

Plese give this wonderful series a chance.  God bless you all.",1360627200,20,2296,4.6992481203007515

Today, this junk that's on is horrible and that's why this world is in a terrible situation.  There are no morales, values or decent way of living.  So I'm grateful for shows like Matlock and other wholesome good family movies and tv show.

5391971,1,B00A73ANIY,"This is a great tv series that should have known when to call it quits! Indeed, SEASON 8 is a mere shadow of what the MATLOCK televison series had been earlier. Don't buy the slow-moving, tedius, pathetic SEASON 8 of ""MATLOCK""---it's essentially a waste of money. I know I won't buying SEASON 9, since the rigor mortis so prominent in Season 8 is probably a preview of the ossification that gripped this show in its later years!",1392508800,2,428,4.571428571428571
