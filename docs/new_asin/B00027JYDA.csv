2065262,2,B00027JYDA,"This is my first Magic School Bus tape and I am disappointed. It is not about sports but about friction,how the body system works together etc. If you are looking for an educational tape about sports this is not it. Also the teacher and students talk real fast in the tape making it hard for very young learners. I ordered the one on the human body and space adventures I hope they are what they say they are.",1157673600,6,409,4.256410256410256
2065263,5,B00027JYDA,Both my boys (5 & 8) Love this one! They laugh so much over the frictionless baseball game !,1133049600,3,92,3.8947368421052633
2065264,4,B00027JYDA,"This is a much better collection than I was expecting!  The segments are on baseball (friction), the Teacher-athalon (cardiovascular health), and (only loosely sports/games related) artifacts.  I'm anxiously awaiting the DVD release of a collection with ""Inside Ralphie"", and the one on cardio-health is an ok substitute while we wait.  For some reason, it seems like several of the most popular episodes are yet to be out on DVD... I wonder why?  None of these are particularly outstanding, but they are all quite good and easy to watch, repeatedly, as toddlers & preschoolers tend to want to do.  The manufacturer thinks this is for kids 6&up I believe, but I would say it may be more entertaining for maybe the 4-5 crowd.  My almost-2 and almost-4 year olds watch them and probably don't get most of the science, but it still encourages them to ask questions and they do pick up on a fair amount of the ""simpler"" content.",1100304000,40,924,4.779874213836478
2065293,5,B00027JYDA,I'm so glad I get to help raise my niece on some of the best shows I grew up on! Great stuff!!,1299110400,,94,3.3181818181818183

2065296,5,B00027JYDA,Great family movies.  My children really learned a lot from watching the series.  Great seller.  I would recommend highly.,1290038400,,122,5.315789473684211

2065299,5,B00027JYDA,"My 5-year-old is a great fan of The Magic School Bus series of DVDs and has been watching them since she was 4 years old. She is now 5 and is better able to grasp the concepts covered in the series. There are three episodes in ""Super Sports Fun"", i.e. ""Plays Ball"" which focuses on a ""frictionless"" baseball game; an up and close look at how muscles work in ""Works Out"" which has our intrepid schoolteacher Ms. Frizzle participating in a race with Mr. Sinew, and finally ""Shows and Tells"" which has Ms. Frizzle and her inquisitive students solving another educational mystery.

This is an excellent series for introducing young children to science and getting them interested in the subject. It is one of the best educational DVDs out there and what's more it is peopled with interesting characters that children can easily relate to which makes it all the more fun! Highly recommended. Rated :Not Rated, in full color, and total running time of 80 minutes. There are some bonus features, e.g. ""Ms. Frizzle Works Out X-Ray"", and ""Friction Fun Race"". The language options are English, French, and Spanish.",1275436800,11,1104,4.810526315789474

2065301,4,B00027JYDA,"The ""Magic School Bus"" series is educational and fun for kids, preschoolers and up. Though the more complex concepts may be too much for younger kids to absorb, my preschooler loves watching the series, and it encourages her to ask lots of questions which I'm only too happy to answer.

This DVD contains three episodes: 'Plays Ball', 'Works Out', and ""Shows and Tells."" There are also bonus features, such as ""Fun Challenges:Ms Frizzle Works Out X-Ray Friction Fun Race"", and a Magic School Bus Trailer. The language options are English, French and Spanish.",1239753600,,558,5.0

2065306,4,B00027JYDA,"Our nearly five year old daughter loves the entire Magic School Bus series. She loves one of the three episodes on this DVD better than the other two, but she is happy to be able to watch any of them. The good thing about the Magic School Bus is that our daughter thinks of it as fun (who wouldn't want to go on an unconventional field trip?) while we know she is learning. It's clean, exciting education. Our favorite tape is Human Body, but this one is in second place.",1209081600,,471,4.2444444444444445

2065309,5,B00027JYDA,"My son and I love the Magic School Bus very much.  I used to watch them on television when I was a kid.  It is educational for young children.  My 4 years old son doesn't understand all the concepts of the different lessons in Magic School Bus, but he is able to pick up a few ideas about how things work together in our world.  For example, he understands that and I quote ""the white blood cells eat up the bacteria in our body that make us sick"" or how the butterfly camouflages to protect itself from any danger. Besides that, I also like the Magic School Bus to encourage children to take chances in learning.  It also encourages the children not to be afraid to make mistake and get messy in the process of learning. After all, it is a part of growing up.",1186790400,,760,4.213793103448276

Now, scholastic has reissued them and they are now available at a REASONABLE price to anyone.  Check out the other book store or search for scholastic!
