8324643,2,B00000EZWF,"I picked up Volume 1 (B-17, B-24, B-29, P-38, P-51, P-40, P-47) ... .I was disappointed, and glad I didn't pay any more than that.
There *was* a fair amount of footage I'd not seen before (and I'm a Warbird fan from way back), including a nice segment from a P-51B PR film.  But the editing is generally poor, with lots and lots of unrelated shots seemingly inserted as filler.
But the script is REALLY atrocious!  Unless you have absolutely no prior knowledge of these planes, turn off the sound - you won't miss much.  The script does not match the film in the least.  And that is *such* a waste given the excellent visuals.
For example, in the B-17 video, there's a moving sequence of aircrews emptying their pockets of personal effects before a mission.  Letters from home, a picture of a girlfriend, and other personal items stack up on a table.  The audio COULD describe what we're seeing, and its significance.  If these boys went down behind enemy lines, they didn't want to give the Nazis any extra intel.  (To this day, combat aircrews carry no personal items into combat.) And if the fliers never came back, these items would be sent back home.  And the voice-over is totally unrelated.  If I didn't know what I was looking at, it would have made no sense whatsoever.
Worse, the narrator reads this empty script as though he can make up for its vapidity with ponderous, over-dramatic delivery.  Ugh.
Kids, here's a great school project idea: Digitize the film clips (there ARE some really good visuals), do some research,and write a new script that actually contains some useful, interesting historical information.  Then put together your own video. I'm sure you could do better.",994032000,2,1691,4.733788395904437
