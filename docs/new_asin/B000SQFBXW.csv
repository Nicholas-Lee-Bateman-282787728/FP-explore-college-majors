2889626,4,B000SQFBXW,"""Chalk"" is a faux documentary that may generate more than a few faux laughs.  It humorously portrays the challenges of public school teachers and administrators.  The situations are often farcical and remind you that, for all its similarity, ""Chalk"" is a send-up of a documentary rather than a genuine documentary.  The characters, despite their quirks or perhaps because of them, I found appealing.

The scene with the ""Spelling Hornet,"" where the teachers compete in a spelling-bee type contest to spell the students' street-slang is a riotous hoot and by itself makes the movie worth watching.

A real good soundtrack as well.  A pleasant way to spend 80 minutes ...",1196467200,3,669,5.091743119266055
2889627,4,B000SQFBXW,"It's just a funny movie. Like mockumentary's like ""The Office"" each character has his/her own quirks that are pretty entertaining. But the characters and themes aren't so off the wall it's unbelievable. Most of the time you know someone like the characters. I recommend it.",1194912000,,273,5.088888888888889
2889628,5,B000SQFBXW,"This movie is incredible!!!!  My wife and I saw it three times in New York City at various screenings.  The actors are all brilliant, the comedy is amazingly true to life, and the story is totally relatable.  The most fun part about watching it at talk back screenings was hearing all of the real life teachers talk about how accurately the profession is portrayed...more so than any other film on the subject.  This film will make you laugh and cringe at the difficulties these teachers face.  It will also make you remember your own high school days, with perhaps a new appreciation for what your teachers endured.  A MUST see!",1192233600,,629,4.672727272727273
2889629,4,B000SQFBXW,"True-to-life documentary-style film in which four completely believable actors and three classes of real students at Travis High School in Austin, Texas, tell it like it is in American public schools. Troy Schremmer as first-year teacher Mr. Lowrey is a fish out of water who gets off on the wrong foot the first day, wrangles with students over misbehavior and ringing cell phones, and eventually evolves as his students decide miraculously not to give up on him. His fellow teachers have their own griefs, gripes, and conflicts - sometimes with students and sometimes with each other.

Meanwhile, a new assistant principal finds herself putting in long hours that alienate her from the faculty she hopes to serve. Many scenes make you cringe; many more make you laugh; often you don't know whether to laugh or cry. While there are small successes along the way, the ambivalent ending is perfect. We now know the truth behind the opening statistic, that 50% of teachers quit in the first three years. Produced on a shoe string, the DVD's feature commentary (by director, cowriter, and producer) is almost as entertaining as the film itself.",1191196800,11,1141,5.005263157894737
2889630,5,B000SQFBXW,"Like other reviewers, I first thought I was watching a real documentary - it's that good. I cringed as I watched ""Mr. Lowery,"" who doesn't seem to be suited to the teaching profession. ""Coach Webb"" was totally believable in the way she connected to her students and alienated her coworkers. The assistant principal was perfect. ""Mr Stroope"" was a little over the top as he drew his students into his quest to be ""teacher of the year.""

I would agree completely with reviewers who are happy to see a movie that doesn't feature a heroic teacher defying the system or smooth, beautiful spoiled teens. This movie works because it's just so...real.

The DVD is worth watching for all the bonus material, especially the director's commentary. The work is almost entirely improv and some cast members are new to acting. The entire film was ""in the can"" for less than $10K. The narrators point out many small but significant points that most audience members will miss.",1191110400,9,961,4.818181818181818
2889631,4,B000SQFBXW,"They really had me going.  I thought for sure when I was watching ""Morgan Spurlock Presents:  `Chalk'"" I was watching a documentary.  Indeed the acting is so natural it took me until a silhouetted fantasy scene half way through the movie to figure out it was not.  Featuring mainly three teachers and one assistant principal, all the mishaps of education come to fruition at fictitious Harrison High School in Texas.  Filmed in Austin, TX and New York City, the tightly knit pseudo simulation year-in-a-life escapades are often funny and very familiar.  Nothing happens even in the bigger moments that doesn't look like real life.  We see the teachers in the classroom, in the teacher's lounge, and being videotaped at their residences.  'Chalk' does to education what 'The Office' does to the workplace.

The Faculty:  Mr. Lowrey (Troy Schremmer) is a first year social studies teacher with a first class case of the jitters.  He stutters and his stilted lectures prove that those who can (as in come from ""The Real World"" with a technical job) can't necessarily teach.  (In that respect he's no Jaime Escalante.)  Admirably, he tries to loosen up and change up the lesson plans and delivery.  Cell phones and missing chalk all but derail the lessons, but at least his learning curve gets him high marks.

Mr. Jack Stroope (Chris Mass) is an energetic third year history teacher.  He spends all his waking hours on his job as many do.  Abrasive, yet caring, he's a coach and a tireless tutor who will go out on a limb to motivate his students.  He can only be faulted for his self-promoting campaign to become ""Teacher of the Year"". His new year's (academic year that is) resolution is to give up sarcasm.

Coach Lindsey Webb (Janelle Schremmer) is a second year PE teacher.  A stickler to the rules, she stalks the halls, taking her colleagues to task for not upholding the tardy policy.  However, at least in her own classes, her vibrant presence takes an admirable tack.  One of the first things she lets us know is that just because she wears short hair and is a PE teacher, doesn't mean she's gay.

Mrs. Reddell (Shannon Haragan) is a first year assistant principal.  Both she and her colleagues are shocked at how different things are when she steps out of the classroom.  Consulting with fellow AP Mr. Odel, she learns quickly that the paper chase is perhaps even worse out of the classroom.  The funniest chase, however, is when she's running down the halls with her walkie-talkie trying to capture students up to mischief.

Subject Matter: Giving too many details of the humorous developments is a spoiler, so I'll just give a topic overview: Tentative copiers, after class conferences, low departmental resources, accidental mishaps, teacher infatuation, and gaffes steeped in fatigue are all par for the course.  There are plenty of philosophical statements by educators who are on a turn sage and often so in the thick of it they're blind-sided.

Evaluation:  'Chalk' is a B+ movie.  The feel is comfortable.  We can recognize, sympathize, and laugh at the folly and frustrations of the educators' lot in life.  The film gets high marks for editing and authenticity.

Reflection:  I am a teacher, and I could relate to nearly all the foibles and predicaments of the protagonists.  Being in those shoes, I found the film funny and cathartic.  At the beginning the movie states that 50 percent of all teachers move on within the first three years of instruction.  Despite poking fun of all players and the process, you can surely say it is sympathetic.",1189555200,29,3563,4.837748344370861
2889632,5,B000SQFBXW,"We saw this film at the Denver Film Festival in 2006 and I am so happy to see that it was picked up and released. If you were ever a student, or have any friends who are teachers, you will enjoy this film.  The acting is great and it's just such a funny yet sad portrayal of what teachers suffer through. Good stuff.",1188518400,4,316,4.015873015873016
2889633,4,B000SQFBXW,"I saw this in the theaters 6 times during the 7 week run it had in Austin, TX.  Two of those times the audience was FULL of teachers who loved it.  Me...I'm an engineer, and our 30 member department went to see it one afternoon and many of them laughed long and hard.  NOTE a correction to the editorial review above - the film never tells if Lowrey resigned or not.",1186704000,4,366,4.126760563380282
2889634,3,B000SQFBXW,"Chalk was about a select group of teachers and administrators at a high school. One was a gym teacher, two were history teachers and another was and assistant principle of the school. Through out this movie the teachers were recorded during classes and also made videos of themselves at home through out one school year. All the teachers had different experience levels for example; one history teacher just started while the gym teacher had two years experience. During this school year the teachers had to deal with many different situations like fights outside of class, students acting up in class, trying to figure out affective ways of getting a point across in the classroom, and also dealing with administrative problems. All these teachers dealt with the situations differently for example the gym teacher was put on hall duty and the school had a strict policy that if a student was late that they should be sent to the office. Well some teachers did not enforce that so the gym teacher pulled the other teacher aside and talked about the situation so it could be put into full affect for the next time, but the other teacher did not take it seriously and disregarded the conversation. The gym teacher handled the situation properly in my opinion, but since there was no punishment for the teacher for having a late student so nothing happened. Another situation that occurred in that a history teacher was very self-centered and wanted teacher of the year so badly that he chose to involve his students in his campaign rather then teaching curriculum to the classroom. Multiple times he brought his personal affairs to the classroom as well which I believe is very inappropriate for the students to be hearing and should not be happening. At the end of the movie some teachers chose to come back at the end of the year while others took a different career path.
This movie has shown very extreme situations in the teaching field which I think is a good way of showing what could actually happen to some people, but it also did not show teachers that were effective in their classroom or teachers that were happy with where they were at so I would rate this movie a 3 out 5 because although it does a great job of showing negative aspects of teaching it does not show positive things that could happen while being a teacher.",1427328000,,2334,4.709046454767726
2889635,2,B000SQFBXW,"""Chalk"", a mockumentary is a satirical documentary with actors that mocks teachers' attitudes, teaching habits, and administration. It follows three teachers: Mr. Stroope, Mr. Lowrey, and Coach Webb. Mr. Stroope is inappropriate with his goal to win teacher of the year by using his students, asking his excelling students to use ""smaller words"", and be less ""smart"" so he doesn't look stupid. Mr. Lowrey is a first year teacher that struggles with classroom management and swears at his student, and even has a drink with one of his student's parent. Coach Webb causes drama, flirts with Mr. Lowrey, and refuses to listen to the assistant principal. I would recommend this documentary to show the incorrect ways to handle students in the classroom and things to NOT do when being a teacher. However, this rockumentary can be seen as insulting to teachers who take their jobs seriously. I found this rockumentary to be funny, but also infuriating in its mocking portrayal of educators.",1426982400,,985,5.08641975308642

2889642,5,B000SQFBXW,"It's obvious that this screenplay was written by teachers and comically addresses the pitfalls and foibles of the education profession.  Low-budget and set in Austin, much of this movie (such as the staff lunch scenes) is ad-libbed as well.  So funny, though it sometimes hits too close to home!  As a veteran teacher, it gave me an opportunity to laugh at some of the more frustrating aspects of my job.",1393891200,,404,4.742857142857143

2889647,5,B000SQFBXW,"Very sharp, very smart and very, very funny film about the joys and perils of teaching.  ""Chalk"" follows a group of young educators (three teachers and an assistant principal) through the course of a school year, as they more or less successfully cope with recalcitrant students, indifferent administrators and one another's idiosyncrasies.

The entire cast is excellent, with the standout being Troy Schremmer, as a first-year history teacher struggling to engage a largely disinterested and often hostile group of students.  The scenes where he tries to maintain discipline in his rowdy classroom are positively painful to watch, especially for someone like me, who has been there and done that!",1330387200,,697,5.376146788990826
2889648,2,B000SQFBXW,"I chose to view Chalk with the expectation of viewing a comedy that exposed the absurdities within the world of teaching that make individual moments tough but the career as a whole worthwhile (or, at the very least, took reality to the extreme to illustrate how out-of-proportion things feel at the moment though, as we all know, are an extreme reaction to a simpler event). This wasn't hyperbole or exaggeration. I didn't see the satire. It was simply reality (even downplayed to some extent, based on my experience). I agree with the reviewer who said that the video was 'more stressful' than funny. I could see using this film as an opportunity to expose the genuine challenges of teaching/education to those who are considering teaching as a career (as a means for discussion of 'how would you handle this'...). But I was disappointed in the comic value. I have seen commentaries on teaching/education on YouTube that (though short) were spot-on. It is hard to capture the points of humor and moments of light within education if you are not an educator yourself. Most of the video was a summary of all the genuine challenges and awkward situations that teachers face, but I didn't see the comic twist. Unlike shows like The Office which are exaggerated forms of the reality I experienced in a real office setting as a bookkeeper, Chalk is more like the side of teaching that ""they don't tell you about in the brochure"". It was too close to reality (negative realities) to be entertaining and too flippant to be academic. The scene with the parent-teacher conference that included wine as a refreshment, was in my opinion, inappropriate (not 'humorously inappropriate, just inappropriate) and ethically regrettable. Again, I might use it as a teaching tool but not as a form of entertainment on a tired evening. I am a public school teacher with added experience in an inner-city private school. I think the portions of the video that I was supposed to find funny were the portions that actually made me sad about the future of our public education system. Even more disturbing is the number of people who will laugh at the plight of the teachers in the film and then, when real teachers raise concerns about some of these same issues, those viewers will laugh and vote/make budgetary decisions based on this 'documentary'. Perhaps individuals who can relate to the video less than I can will find it more entertaining. I did not laugh during this film. Considering its billing as a comedy, I was disappointed.",1308441600,,2515,4.851162790697674
2889649,4,B000SQFBXW,"I generally love mockumentaries. And Chalk is no exception.

Chalk's understated and dry dramedy had me laughing out loud a few times in this ""look"" into the lives of teachers.

A newbie teacher faces his first classroom and flails about. Finally, one of the teens asks him how long he'd been a teacher. After one of the longest non-answers (maybe he has a future in politics) I've ever heard he admits his teaching career can be measured in an hour and some odd minutes. The viewer feels the descending awful reality that this guy may have just signed an emotional death warrant.

Another drama that unfolds within this amusing story is that of the best friend teachers who now have to deal with a big change. One of them has become Assistant Principal.

A third focal teacher is the guy who is just on the edge of still cool. Watching him work through the year is often hysterical, and other times horrific.

Though Chalk isn't going to appeal to those who love action-packed or true-life inspirational, it should appeal greatly to those who love understated and the comedy of every day life.

Overall this is a tame film. A few BS's and a long discussion of what a student called a teacher but with letters vs. the words, and the assistant principal who is finding that her job is cutting into her sex life is as family unfriendly as it gets.

If you are a mockumentary lover, Parks and Rec or Office fan you should give this one a shot.",1304467200,,1440,4.515384615384615
2889650,5,B000SQFBXW,"I got this movie thinking it was a documentary but was not disappointed when I found out it wasn't. There are some scenes that the movie could have done without (namely the teacher telling the student about the overlarge backpack and the dream sequence) but overall it was spot on. Teachers trying to enforce policies that other teachers blow off; a new teacher being spotted right away and being pounced on; blowing up at students and throwing them out of class- I have experienced all these things as a teacher. Then there are the small victories: like getting them to take you seriously for more than ten minutes at a time or the ""spelling hornet"" (I've never done one). And finally, the decision- do I want to do this for another year?

For all those out there who think ""teachers get the summer off so why do they complain about pay?"" watch this movie and revise your question.",1297987200,,882,4.582278481012659
2889651,2,B000SQFBXW,"No I'm not a teacher or engineer as someone else here stated - as if this would help the movie be more funny. Yes in the first half of the movie it tries to convey ""teachers are people too"", but once you get that picture the movie is coasting down hill without gaining momentum. You can only laugh at a dim-wit teacher who is as un-comfortable being a teacher as he is being a man so often. The the a-typical female gym teacher who is NOT gay but has issues too is also thrown in. But for me if the movie took each teachers personality and gave it more depth as the movie went forward there would be reason to finish watching it. Overall once you get the first couple laughs it just vomits the same thing up over and over again leaving that kind of acid taste in your mouth - like one more time is one more time too many. At least it was only 99 cents and 45 min spent on this movie that had way more potential than it delivered.",1293840000,,929,4.054347826086956
2889652,5,B000SQFBXW,"This movie is fantastic, especially if you've ever been at teacher at the high school level. I felt like I was watching my first year teaching over again. Definitely worth a rental. If you're not a teacher and you don't appreciate it, please try to. It's shows the true challenges of current public education system.",1277683200,,316,4.763636363636364
2889653,1,B000SQFBXW,"So I watched the preview, and I figured that this was a real documentary.  It's actually supposed to be a comedy about the lives of high school teachers.  This fact got me even more excited about the movie, as I'm a high school teacher right now.  Unfortunately, this movie fails on so many levels, I found it to be practically unwatchable.

The actors are very good, particularly for a B movie, and the history teacher in particular is so good that it worries me he might actually be a teacher (and a pretty poor one at that).  The kids in the movie are pretty good most of the time, but there are clearly a few times where they know they're watching strong acting, and giggle a bit.  No big deal.  The problems are with everything else.

Some bits are kind of funny, but other times, you're not really sure what you're watching.  The jokes are repetitive, and sometimes very few and far between.  Some try really hard to be funny and fall flat.  There are lots of scenes which are pointless, such as the scene where one teacher feigns concern for a student with a large backpack.  I think it was supposed to be funny, but it wasn't.

My girlfriend put it best.  ""It's not really funny, it's kind of...stressful.""  Filming is erratic and cuts from place to place frequently.  The situations are true to real life, but not in a good way.  Some of them make you laugh, others will make you angry, and there's not any progression of the characters as far as I can tell.  This movie also feels really long when you're watching it.  I felt like it was about 4 hours long thanks to the repetition and useless scenes, when it was really less than an hour and a half.

My advice - skip it.  This movie had a whole lot of potential, but it's garbage.",1257811200,5,1742,4.364485981308412
2889654,4,B000SQFBXW,"This is a very entertaining movie. It is like ""The Office"" meets teaching. Some scenes were so real it seemed like I was really watching teachers and students in a classroom.

2889655,5,B000SQFBXW,"Chalk is an absolutely hysterical mockumentary from Morgan Spurlock and director/writer Mike Akel along with writer/actor Chris Mass. At first I, too, thought it was a documentary--the previews for it even had me fooled. However, it wasn't too long after I started watching the DVD that I realized this couldn't really be happening--and I was laughing harder while watching this movie than I've laughed during any movie in years. The acting is completely convincing despite the fact this so much of the relationships between the faculty--as well as what goes on between faculty and students--to be completely absurd. The cinematography works really well and the choreography works well in the many crowded scene inside the school throughout the picture. In addition, the plot follows the cast through what they present to us as being an entire school year; and the action moves along at a very good pace. You won't be bored!

As I'm sure you can imagine by now, nearly everything that could go wrong does go wrong. There are students who escape detention by climbing up through the roof so that the assistant principal, Mrs. Reddell (Shannon Haragan) can't find them. Moreover, cell phones ring endlessly while the most nervous, uptight new teacher Mr. Lowrey (Troy Schremmer) tries desperately to gain control over his class full of mischievous kids. There's also the somewhat masculine gym teacher Coach Lindsey Webb (Janelle Schremmer) who's very defensive about the fact that she is not attracted to other women. Coach Webb also specializes in gradually picking more and more fights with her peers and even her (now) former best friend, Mrs. Reddell, who became assistant principal after someone was ""found guilty"" and was forced to resign.

And there's more. We get a great performance by writer/actor Chris Mass who plays Jack Stroope, a third year history teacher who doesn't really know history as much as some of his students do (!!!); and even the cameraman joins in to play a cameo as one of the school janitors who ""dropped a piano"" prompting a huge investigation by Mrs. Reddell and other staff.

It may seem that I've given too much away but there's plenty more that I am leaving out here. The laughs go on and on. The character development is superb; and the young men and women playing the roles of students (which they are in real life) do an admirable job. Great!

The DVD comes with quite a few extras. These include an optional running commentary with Morgan Spurlock, writer/director Mike Akel, and writer/actor Chris Mass; brief essays by people involved in the making of this film about their favorite teachers; and there's a deleted scene involving Mrs. Reddell and the man who dropped the piano! We also get two or three shorts including the typical ""day"" in the life of a substitute teacher. Ouch!

Chalk is a riot and it's very creative as well. I highly recommend this film for people who enjoy comedies and mockumentaries. People interested in the real life school system just might enjoy this picture, too.",1241481600,,3036,4.9450980392156865

The concept is hilarious, but it goes on, and on, and on...and ON.  Seems like it never ends.  The characters have a seed of interest and potential, but nothing that is interesting to watch for a full movie.

Got this because I saw the preview and thought it was a real documentary.  It's not.  It's a mockumentary, much like Spinal Tap.  That would be great, if it was funny.  It's not.

The gym teacher annoyed the hell out of me, just watching her made me cringe. The Math teacher was moderately entertaining but at the same time way too egotistical. The only one who interested me was the PA and that's mostly because she is gorgeous. I don't know I think it could have been much more entertaining with better stories and I felt it jumped around too much. It was a pretty boring mockumentory.

And why is ""documentary"" the first suggested tag description if it's not actually a documentary?  Very confusing.

As far as the movie itself goes, I guess it's not totally awful. I was really interested until I found out that it was fiction.

I am in school now to get a degree to teach high school history, so I thought I would check this out. My father was a high school principal so I have seen teachers out of the classroom in candid settings such as a teachers lounge, or out at a dinner partaking in a few drinks, and this movie captures this perfectly. It shows that most teachers are just younger people trying to figure out life. Those of us with children think of them as Teachers 24/7 but this film reminds us that they date, drink, and have issues just like the rest of us.

Eccentricity, incompetence, arrogance, near-illiteracy in some cases, bureaucratic stupidity--on and on the tales go.  There's a lot of urban myth to the stories, but there are occasional glimmers of truth.

What we almost never talk about is how demanding and frequently unrewarding public school teaching can be.  Director Mike Akel, himself a former teacher, reminds us of this from the get-go in his wonderful ""Chalk"" by stating at the film's beginning that 50% of public school teachers quit in their first three years.  The rest of the film, hilarious at times, touching at others, helps us understand why.

The action focuses on a number of personalities:  the brandnew and incredibly--but lovably--geeky and awkward Mr. Lowrey (Troy Schremmer), the pushy but insecure Coach Webb (Janelle Schremmer, Troy's real-life spouse), the bumbling and ambitious Young Turk Mr. Stroope (Chris Masse), and the overworked Assistant Principle Ms. Reddell (Shannon Haragan).  A great deal of the dialogue could well be improvisational.  It certainly has the feel of spontaneity to it (that's meant as a compliment, by the way).  Each in his or her own way is incredibly conscientious, eager to help kids, flawed in one way or another (teachers are, after all, human beings), and faced with a daily barrage of challenges that would cripple most of us. (As a rather worn-out principle tells Ms. Reddell at one point, he looked forward to becoming an administrator so that he wouldn't have to take his work home with him--papers to grade, etc.  And he doesn't.  That's the good news.  The bad news that he's now at work 12 hours a day, plus half of each weekend.)

Instead of tying up loose ends in a nice, happy ending, Akel skillfully closes the film on an ambiguous note that leaves the viewer with mixed emotions.

A very good indie film:  well-acted, nicely shot, funny, with a message that provokes thought and compassion.  Keep it in mind the next time you get mad at one of your kid's teachers.",1216512000,3,2175,5.013927576601671

2889670,4,B000SQFBXW,"The low-budget comedy ""Chalk"" provides a welcome antidote to all those inspirational, cookie-cutter crowd-pleasers like ""Freedom Writers"" and ""Dangerous Minds"" that Hollywood routinely proffers as its answer to our troubled schools.

Although this is a scripted, fictional film, co-writers Mike Akel (who is also the director) and Chris Mass (who also plays one of the teachers) have given ""Chalk"" the look and feel of a slice-of-life documentary.  Director Akel has trained his cameras on a handful of young teachers and one first-year administrator as they go about the business of molding young minds at a fictional school called Harrison High (though the location remains unidentified, the movie itself was filmed in Austin, Texas).  Yet, these are not your typical movie ""super teachers"" who, through sheer force of personality and a series of well-crafted lessons, are able to convert their initially hardened students into lifelong lovers of learning.  Rather, the teachers here are well-meaning but imperfect mortals who wage a daily battle with students who won't learn, copiers that won't copy, and colleagues who often don`t see eye-to-eye even on the most rudimentary aspects of teaching and learning, let alone on how best to run a school.  Frankly, it's a good day for these teachers if the students aren't fighting in the lunch area, hiding the chalk as a lame practical joke, or arguing about why they aren't allowed to use a cell phone in class.  And there are times in which the teachers themselves come across as more insecure, petty and immature than even their own students.  Yet, there are also those special moments when the teachers and pupils manage to connect on a meaningful level - those little flashes of hope that the whole frustrating ordeal might just possibly amount to something worthwhile in the end.

With a droll sense of humor and a flair for gentle satire, the filmmakers poke affectionate fun at the life of a teacher, while at the same time evincing a genuine respect for the characters and what it is they are trying to do.  The movie acknowledges that teaching is a difficult profession, yet it doesn't insult those who dedicate their lives to it by pretending that all one need have to be successful is a magical combination of motivational speeches and good intentions.

The cast members, most of whom are newcomers to the movies, never undercut the joke by winking at the camera or treating the material with anything less than total earnestness.  They genuinely appear to be ad-libbing their lines, lending to the film the air of spontaneity and improvisation befitting a documentary.  And the movie ends on a note of quiet poignancy that reminds us of just how powerful a tool restraint can be in making a point.

By refusing to resort to either melodrama or hyperbole, ""Chalk"" paints about as realistic a portrait of life in the classroom as I've seen in quite some time.",1212192000,5,2920,4.983539094650205
2889671,5,B000SQFBXW,"CHALK is a fake documentary that follows the school year of three teachers, with varying years of experience, and a first-year assistant principal at Harrison High School in Austin, Texas.  The main characters are Mr. Stroope (Chris Mass) an overly confident third-year social studies teacher who is determined to be named ""Teacher of the Year"" before the year's end; Coach Webb (Janelle Schremmer) a determined, passionate, and sometimes pushy second-year P.E. teacher and volleyball coach who fights against stereotypes and is determined to change things and people, but won't change herself; Mrs. Reddell (Shannon Haragan) a former music teacher of five years who is now a new assistant principal after the former assistant principal was arrested and found guilty of criminal activities; and Mr. Lowrey (Troy Schremmer) a former business executive who left to corporate world to seek employment where he could make a difference in the world and is now a very anxious and nervous first-year history teacher.

CHALK is unlike any other film I have seen before about teaching.  Most teaching movies revolve around one or a group of inspiring teachers who are shown changing the lives of their students, involves some hugely dramatic conflict, and wraps up nicely at the end with the teacher being acknowledged for the huge impact they have had upon their students.  CHALK is not like that.  The back of the DVD case describes being a ""doc comedy style of THE OFFICE"" but at a high school.  That's a fairly accurate description of style of the movie. However, it's not very descriptive about what CHALK is really like.  I am a high school teacher myself and in my opinion the film, though fictional, gives a fairly decent overview of what teaching is really like: the few highs, the miserable lows, and the huge amount of frustration and inadequacy of each day.  There's a mixture of excitement and drama, comedy, lots of frustration, and just the right about of boredom and tedium.  The film probably won't inspire anyone to enter the profession, but it does provide a nice glimpse into the life of a high school teacher.

There are some discrepancies in the movie and between real teaching.  For example, the classes seen in the movie are much too small than the typical high school classroom and there is no mention about testing and the impact that has and is having on changing the typical day in a high school.  Still, the movie does a better job than any other teaching film about what teaching is really like.  Mike Akel and Chris Mass are the ""writers"" of the film and Akel's also is the director, and Mass is one of the stars as Mr. Stroope.  Both of these men were former teachers themselves and I believe their experiences are what grounds the movie (mostly) in reality.  The film was made for around $10,000 and much of the script was improvised around an outline provided by Akel and Mass.  The result is exceptional and is a movie I think that everyone could benefit from watching, though not necessarily enjoying.

It should be noted that though all of the acting in the film is exceptional, there are some standout performances.  The first is that of the students.  The students in the movie are real life students, many who had either Mr. Akel's or Mr. Mass as their teacher, and gave up most of their summer to not be paid so they could be in the movie.  Their actions and dialogue are real and add to the grounded feeling of the film; they are just being themselves which is what much of the greatest acting ever performed really is.  The other standout performance in the film is that of Troy Schemmer who performs Mr. Lowrey.  Schemmer does an excellent job of capturing all the quirks and idiosyncrasies of a nervous, first-year teacher who is just trying to make a difference in the world and share a passion of his for those younger than he.  Lowrey is the heart and soul of the movie and the story, though seemingly not intentionally, revolves around him.  For example, the film opens with the statement that ""50% of all teachers quit within the first three years,"" and it ends with an ambiguous scene of Mr. Lowrey packing his things away for the summer, leaving the audience to guess for themselves if he returns or leaves and joins the ranks of the statistics.

CHALK is an A film that everyone should see at least once.  Teachers will love it because it is so real and filmmakers should watch it because it illustrates that a huge budget isn't necessary to make a great movie as long as there is a solid story and script.

The DVD includes a commentary with Chris Mass, Mike Akel, and Morgan Spurlock; essays from the cast and crew about their favorite teachers;  two mock Harrison High School PSAs; a featurette entitled ""The Chalk Journey"" about how the movie came to open in New York as a feature; a playful short film with characters from the cast entitled BROKEN DREAMS; and the extended trailer for the movie.",1209254400,4,4944,4.730769230769231
2889672,4,B000SQFBXW,"This is an enjoyable ""documentary"" as I actually believed it was real teachers in the roles until a scene in the movie in which one teacher is having fantasies of dancing with another teacher in the hall. Still, the movie truly captures what it is like to be a teacher. There is the first year History teacher who struggles each day to find ways to keep his class managed so he can teach. There is the new Assistant Principal who is caught between old friendships and dealing with bureaucracy. There is the Social Studies teacher bent on being ""teacher of the year"" and there is humor, insight and reality about the world of teaching throughout the show. I laughed, nodded in agreement and empathized with the teachers (since I'm a teacher) all thru this movie. It makes you think and it shows just how difficult it can be to be a teacher yet we never give up on the kids.",1206316800,,872,4.45625
2889673,5,B000SQFBXW,"At a recent teacher meeting, we were invited to screen the movie Chalk.  Most of us had never heard of this relatively small film yet its impact was hard to deny.  Laughter erupted from more that 70 educators as we could identify with the characters from our own experiences.  Right from the start, Chalk caught our interest and kept it longer than I expected.  Although it is over the top in areas, this film was made for the right reasons.  It embraces the ups, downs, and all-arounds of teaching.  If you know anyone who teaches, this film is for them.  Oh yea, Chalk was created by two Texas teachers.  Enjoy the film...",1205193600,2,624,4.508928571428571

2889675,4,B000SQFBXW,"It may have slipped through the cracks of critical acclaim, film festival dominance, and (dare I say it?) commercial success, but Chalk is still one of the most likable films of 2007. It's a funny, fast-paced, and at times touching mockumentary, full of deliciously awkward  social pitfalls and wonderfully drawn characters. The movie skillfully avoids the less scintillating aspects of the mockumentary genre, easily sidestepping the obvious humor and cheap shots the worst parodies. Its characters aren't caricatures, its situations aren't contrived or cliched, and its humor isn't forced. Instead, the laughs are genuine and hearty, the best jokes unexpected and insightful. The characters and situations should ring resoundingly true for anybody who's ever navigated the American high school system. They're well-drawn and three dimensional, full of quirks both lovable and repelling. At times, Chalk approaches the same lofty highs reached by the Office and Curb Your Enthusiasm; it makes the audience laugh at and sympathize with the characters at the same time, simultaneously evoking comedy and drama, manic glee and emotional resonance. Really, it's a hell of a trick. The result is a hilarious, entertaining, satirical, and affectionate portrait of our education system.

Still, I find it hard to give Chalk more than four stars. It's a fantastic film, to be sure, but not really a masterpiece. It's too slight for that: The laughs come fast and easy, but there's nothing here that'll have you rolling in the aisles. Similarly, the story itself is sweet and often affecting, but it falls just short of packing an emotional wallop. All of which makes Chalk a fun, lighthearted, and utterly accessible romp (and maybe even a classic in its own right), but little more than that.",1202601600,2,1786,5.2631578947368425

The mockumentary was pretty good and funny at times. If you like shows like ""The Office"", this shows has the same format. The funniest parts of the film are the Teacher of the Year Debate (when the teacher says that he is a product of corporal punishment and what he has learned it that ""if you can't beat them, join them"") and the Spelling Hornet (where the teachers are the ones on the spelling contest trying to spell out slang words). This film is pretty funny.

As another reviewer mentioned, the acting was very natural and although I knew this was a mockumentary, I found myself wondering at times if it was indeed real and I was mistaken.",1202342400,,870,5.397058823529412
2889677,3,B000SQFBXW,"I think 3 stars perfectly sums this movie up.  It's not bad, not good, it's just kinda there.  It has it's funny moments and the children behave very realistically, but, it feels like they could have done so much more with the material.  If anything, this should be listed under dramas because you wind up doing more empathizing than laughing.  ""Office Space"" this is certainly not, but it will make you reconsider if you've ever wanted to teach.  I think it's worth a glance but it's hardly the kind of thing you'll be forcing your friends/family to watch.",1202083200,,557,4.642857142857143
2889678,1,B000SQFBXW,"I think it's safe to say that I expected much more from `Chalk' then I received.  Going into the film knowing that I was watching a mockumentary I was put off by the fact that it feels too much like an actual documentary.  What I mean by that is that for the most part it's not really all that funny.  It has it's moments but to place yourself in the genre with classic Christopher Guest films you kind of have to bring your A-Game to each and every scene, and `Chalk' just doesn't do that.  I will say that I really wanted to like this movie, but about a quarter of the way through I realized that that just wasn't going to happen.

The film follows four teachers throughout the course of a school year, each of which is battling their own problems, inside and outside the classroom.  We have Mrs. Reddell who has been promoted to AP (assistant principle) and finds that it is creating stress between herself and her husband as well as between her and some of the other teachers, namely Coach Webb who feels that Reddell should take her side more.  Speaking of Coach Webb, she is struggling with the female-coach stereotype, as in she's not interested in women as some may expect but proves too intimidating for the men.  Mr. Lowrey is the new teacher who is trying to establish some respect within his classroom and that leaves us with Mr. Stroope, the most annoying of the bunch, a self obsessed man intent on being named `Teacher of the Year'.

The problem I have with these characters is that they are far too dull to be interesting.  I couldn't find any reason to care about these people.  Aside from her frantic attempt to break up a schoolyard fight Mrs. Reddell was in a word `boring'.  Same can be said for both Mr. Lowrey and Coach Webb except neither of them have the schoolyard scene to fall back on for laughs.  Mr. Stroope just drove me up a wall.  I hated him.  You see, in this type of film you're characters are required to be exaggerations of real people.  Watch `Drop Dead Gorgeous' or `For You Consideration' for perfect examples of what I mean here.  By exaggerating what real people would do in a simple situation you create brilliant comedic situations.  These characters don't feel like exaggerations.  In fact, they feel undercooked.

I know that many may not agree with me here, and maybe it takes a certain kind of humor to appreciate this, humor I don't possess, but I don't think that can be it since I like to belive I have a pretty diverse sense of humor.  Oh well, what can I say.  Sadly, I was not impressed.",1200268800,6,2542,4.433189655172414
2889679,3,B000SQFBXW,"I actually thought this was a real documentary by the guy who filmed Super Size Me about the struggles of novice teachers until a goofy dream sequence, which made it obvious that none of it was real. I realized this was actually a mockumentary in the style of the TV show The Office. I think the filmmakers should have left this fantasy sequence out, because, while funny, it took me out of the movie. The film felt very authentic until that sequence. It felt like a warts and all portrait of teaching, not something all glossy like Mr. Holland's Opus or Mr. Chips. The actors are very natural in their roles and look like ordinary people, not movie stars. A good film, but it should have cut out the dream sequence and the other few scenes (like one with a teacher throwing a desk) that ruined the real-life feel of the film. I would definitely recommend this to teachers or those thinking of becoming teachers.",1198281600,5,912,4.533333333333333

8206381,1,B000SQFBXW,"The documentary ""chalk"" was extremely hard and boring to watch. This documentary was almost degrading to teachers and the teachers didn't have any qualities that I would want for my childrens teachers or any of my co-workers. Teachers were very rude to other teachers in the same school, for example when one teacher asks a bigger looking teacher to walk every morning with a few other teachers to get exercise so the teacher wouldnt be so big. The active teacher purposely asked the bigger teacher because she didn't approve of her co-workers weight, but the active teacher should not have a say in how the bigger lady should look. Also, the assistant principal was very unprofessional when a fight was happening outside the school. She was screaming at the students and telling them to get away, she didn't go get help she just freaked out and stood in the way. There was a good part in the documentary when the administrator stated how much he worked including that he worked 12+ hour weekdays and worked on Saturdays also.

8206384,4,B000SQFBXW,"""Chalk is a mockumentary about how teachers act in classrooms and behind the scenes. It is really interesting to see the things teachers talk about when students aren't around. I think students sometimes forget that teachers are human too, and they have lives outside of school, along with their own sets of problems they are trying to figure out. They can be competitive, pushy, sneaky, sad, stressed, or a number of other things that normal people feel. It puts into perspective how much teachers deal with considering they the types of students they have to deal with and types of people they have to work with. Also, it shows how good teachers can have it with great students and co worker relationships. It all depends on the teacher you want to be and if you can make it out of sticky situations or get stuck. I know this movie was supposed to be making fun of teachers, but it seemed like it was funny because of how true it was. It showed me how difficult being a teacher can be, but it also showed me how fun and rewarding it can be as well. I give this movie four stars out of five because it was the best documentary I have ever watched, but I still am not a huge documentary fan.",1427846400,,1191,4.36936936936937

All teachers have struggles and this film definitely showed that. I did not care for the acting in this movie it almost did not feel real, the teachers did not have the passion I see in school today. This film in my opinion was poorly done. It did show some good points on how teachers act in the classroom but is almost exaggerated. This was more comedy and I enjoyed that, but didn't see where the point of this film was going. Over all I did not like this movie and I would not watch this film again because it was hard to follow along with.

8206386,3,B000SQFBXW,"Chalk is a satirical mockumentary about a group of teachers, most in the first few years of teaching. The mockumentary follows the teachers through a calendar school year, and documents the struggles and challenges they face on a daily basis. Through the use of dark humor and wit, this movie proves that teaching is often a thankless job with long hours and little rest. Over the course of the mochumentary, we see the teachers develop not only as instructors, but also as individuals. What I like about this movie is that we saw not only the teachers in the classroom, but we also saw the teachers outside of their jobs, living their daily lives. The movie also showed the teachers disagreeing quite a bit. Occasionally, we would see the teachers arguing at the school, in the presence of other teachers and students. I think that it is inappropriate to fight publicly, especially when you are a teacher and there are students present. I would recommend this movie to friends and family if I know they have a dry sense of humor, if they are in the teaching profession, or if they like mockumentary style films, like The Office. I would give this movie a rating of 3 out of 5 stars.",1427587200,,1183,4.611374407582939
8206387,4,B000SQFBXW,"Chalk is a mocumentary where a group of actors portray the attitudes of high school teachers and administrators.  Each teacher is given attitudes that are examples of real teachers. For example, the history teacher is very relaxed towards his students and only cares about the relationships he is building with his students. Also, the P.E. teacher, Coach Webb, is the pushy teacher who just wants to make sure the rules are intact but also trying to get the involvement of all of her students in her class. This is a great movie for teachers because it talks about the life outside of the school. Such as the assistant principal, she doesnt get home until ten oclock for most nights. It also shows how difficult the first couple years of teaching are. A first year teacher has to gain the respect of their students, other teachers, prepare lesson plans, while trying not to pull out their hair. This is also great for showing how diverse schools can be and how teachers have to be prepared to adapt to adversity. Teachers aren't always going to be put into the perfect school district. There will be challenges to overcome. I gave this movie 4 stars because it was made in 2006. If there were a more recent version, especially with the advancement of technology in schools, it would be more relevant to new coming teachers.",1427587200,,1323,4.702586206896552
