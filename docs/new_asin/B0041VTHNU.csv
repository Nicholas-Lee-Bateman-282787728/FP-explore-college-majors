4246735,5,B0041VTHNU,"July 2nd, 1977...Duschene, Utah. There I was, sweltering in the summer heat, and suffering the consequences of an unrequitted longing for air-conditioning caused by a delirious cross-country bicycle ride. These set of conditions made for a perfect viewing of this formless, non-linear narrative of the evolution of Nina, played with uncommon comic timing by Liza Minelli. You see, there is a contessa of an indeterminate background who instructs Nina in the finer points of soft-focus cinematography in an effort to conceal the ravages of time and incipient Alzheimers , as ably demonstrated by the director of this exercise in the flagrant waste of film processing chemicals. I laughed. I cried. It was better than Cats...not! As I recall, there were a number of musical interludes, festooned with brupt and arbitrary costume changes, not unlike Madonna on crystal meth. The dialog was as hackneyed as a plagarized Freshman 101 creative-writing exercise done under the influence of copious quantities of caffeine and qualudes 2 hours prior to the end-of-term deadline. Needless to say, I was delighted. There was non-stop merriment not unlike that of Ed Woods opus magnum Plan Nine From Outer Space or the excreable Attack of thre Killer Tomatoes. Rent this at your peril...if you have a pre-existing abdominal wall weakness, your large intestines will no doubt protrude from your inguinal area in a manner that will prompt your significant other to utter ""Is that your intestines or are you just happy to see me?"".",1238803200,6,1516,5.191836734693878

8413191,4,B0041VTHNU,"Before I start my review I want to point out that there are  as I write this  already 10 reviews posted going back to 2015, Since the newest is January 2017 and the DVD that is listed here was not released until June 2017, I knew immediately that Amazon posted reviews a 1976 film with Liza Minelli which shared the same title. Youll find that one here: https://www.amazon.com/Matter-Time-Ingrid-Bergman/dp/B0041VTHNU/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1499952501&sr=1-1&keywords=a+matter+of+time+liza

Im tried to notify Amazon but not sure if they will fix it.

Anyway, this is probably the first review of the 2016 documentary (on DVD in 2017) about British Columbia rock musician Kathryn Calber (piano/guitar) who plays in a trio named Immaculate Machine and toured for a while with the Canadian band The New Pornographers. Calders mom was diagnosed with ALS (better known as Lou Gehrigs Disease) which is terminal. She stopped traveling and moved (with her piano) into the 2nd floor of her family home and began writing new songs inspired by her mom. That way she was always in the house. There are LOTS of musical performances in this 85 minute film and interviews with members of both bands. You also learn a bit about Lou Gehrig with archival film clips (though I felt the director used the same clip way too many times). The film serves a few purposes and does it pretty well. How well you enjoy Calders music depends on your musical tastes.

The four bonus features on the DVD include a couple of 2 minute performances as well as an 18 minute clip from a performance at the Royal BC Museum (which is only excerpted in the film). Lastly is a throw-away promo for her ALS Ice Bucket Challenge.

Im glad I saw it, though  as I said  the love of Calders music is subjective, and it just didn't grab me to want to look for her recordings.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
