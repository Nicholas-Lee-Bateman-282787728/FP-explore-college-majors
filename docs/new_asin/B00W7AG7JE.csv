7125868,5,B00W7AG7JE,"I saw this in the theatre and anticipated its release for the home library. Gripping and compelling. As a South Korean adoptee to the U.S., this hit very close to home, and for me, was personally difficult to watch.

7125898,5,B00W7AG7JE,"This true story of a quiet, tenderhearted, and courageous couple who rescue abandoned babies in Seoul, South Korea will make you stand up and shout. Poignant, heartbreaking, and inspiring, the Drop Box is my favorite movie of the year. I recommend it to adults and kids 10 and up who desire to look around their own neighborhoods and towns and figure out what they can do to make a difference. The story of how the couple fell in love and found their calling is creatively and sometimes humorously told with both real-life footage and animation. My favorite parts are the ones when their adopted Drop Box son describes how he overcame the prejudice of his classmates and won their admiration as well as their votes in the race for class president. The real kicker is when this 10 or 11 year-old  tells the movie audience how he wants to take over his parents' work when they are no longer able. Hugely humbling and highly, highly recommended.",1471996800,2,942,4.674698795180723

7125974,5,B00W7AG7JE,"This is a disturbing movie, a movie about people bucking the trend in attempting to live with deep humanity in a day horribly lacking in humanness. The premise, shown far more than spoken, is that as people and their nations world around seem to be fascinated with an expanding culture of death... irrationally; really, fascination and fixation on destruction and death? However it is reality and it is almost to a point an historically educated person might recognize as worship. As this is taking place, its reality is demonstrated in the devaluation of life, shown in this movie, by the increasing mistreatment of the most helpless in our cultures and societies. This movie, a true story, is about some who have rejected religion (in my opinion always a creation of men) because they are responding to an admittedly subjective, though nonetheless real, experience of having been, they say, personally called out, touched, and living being changed in nature by the real and Living Jesus. Some of these ""called-out ones"" are standing against the lemming-like flow toward depravity and death by giving up their security and social acceptance and allowing their comfort, energy and resources to be spent doing all they can to help provide good lives for, giving respect and care for the dignity of those weakest members of humanity. The story clearly shows the, should be expected, reaction of those in the surrounding cultures aware enough to realize their self-centered, self-serving, inhumanity is being brought into clear view of anyone with eyes to see.",1445472000,2,1557,5.109803921568627

It was an inspiring movie that we watched as a family, and a beautiful picture of dieing to self when we allow God to give us His heart burdens.
It was a great glimpse into the huge orphan crisis, I just wanted more. I would've loved to hear less opposing opinion (though I understand why it was necessary) and more about the Holy Spirit fuel behind this man's heart.
As an adoptive mother, I believe we need more movies advocating for the orphaned that will open eyes to see the real spiritual battle going on for & against human life.

They didn't really explain what happens to all the babies they don't keep and why they chose to keep the ones they did.

I had to rewind a few times to capture what missed visually; but regardless this movie is a must see!

It was hard to read the subtitles and pay attention to the pictures at the same time. Sometimes the subtitles moved too fast, too. I had to go back several times. I am not sure, had I not known the basic premise of the story, if it would have made much sense to me.

I do recommend the companion book by the director Brain Ivie. It does not really tell how the movie was made, it tells about Brian's conversion as a result of making it. Read the book first. It makes the movie make more sense.",1439337600,4,716,4.114285714285714

I'm thankful he is making a difference and statement by his selfless heart of loving these babies and children especially in his culture. I admire him and am inspired by the movie. In fact, after watching the film, it made me want to create a Drop Box and spread the word so that babies lives can be saved. The movie was so good that I wanted to see even more of the footage that was shot during the filming.

This movie inspires the viewer to not only recognize a problem but take actions to contribute to the solution. The film also shows how the children are inspired by their parent's work and have worked hard to overcome their own challenges. The film does show the difficult schedule and many duties that are needed to take proper care of the disabled children (feeding tubes and other medical care). It also shows the toll of the workload from raising 15 children. I watched in awe as the pastor though exhausted handled all situations with grace.

Many of the children are ditched because of disabilities and deformities. Some of the things in this movie are hard to look at, but overall this is a good movie.
