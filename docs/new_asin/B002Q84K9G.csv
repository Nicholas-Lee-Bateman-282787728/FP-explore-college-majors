8377555,5,B002Q84K9G,"I love using the magic school bus videos to teach my 5th grade student science. When I couple these videos with worksheets and hands-on activities, the kids learn so much more and remember what has been taught. Since I teach in Spanish, the spanish language option on the DVD's is wonderful. Thanks!",1304208000,,299,4.769230769230769
