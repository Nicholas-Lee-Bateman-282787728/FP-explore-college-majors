2326571,5,B0009W5KJU,"I agree totally with the last two reviews. Growing up in Australia in the 1980's I was unaware that the eps of ALF were editing shows. It was not until I lived in the USA in 90/91 that I saw to my great surprise, the same episodes with like 7 extra minutes in them!

I am grateful for the release of all of ALF on DVD, but please... please... Lions Gate, look to your competition, to see how they release... Complete should mean COMPLETE....",1119139200,5,441,4.25
2326572,1,B0009W5KJU,"This season will contain the cut versions so once again we will be missing 3-7 minutes of eatch episode.

Not releasing the original 24-25 minutes episodes Lionsgate are showing disrespect for ALF, american culture and last but not least: Their customers!

Only a Lionsgate-employe or a person who has never seen the original versions would even consider to give this garbage more than 2 stars.
Giving it 5 stars must be some kind of a joke! Why would anyone in their right mind give this message to Lionsgate: ""We are satisfied with cut episodes - don't mind us, just carry on making cheap releases and make a lot of money""

Wait for the UK-release and don't let yourself be fooled by people with hidden motives or no quality-sense!",1118966400,14,733,4.7109375
2326573,5,B0009W5KJU,"That Season 1 Episodes were Syndicated?? AKA--ReRuns
Lionsgate Entertainment bought up the Syndicated episodes because they were Cleaner than the UN-Cut Original episodes and they didn't want to take the time to Clean them up.
If your Season 1 Episode 1 starts in the garage, you own a Butchered Complete Season 1.
Episode 1 starts with a Pan of the back yard with Willie and Brian going into the garage. It has a Run Time of Aprox--25:00 Minutes, when shown UnCut, Season 1 Episode 1 is Aprox--22:00 Minutes.
Also check The Running Time of The Entire DVD, i believe it says 620 Minutes, Wrong, it is actually somewhere around 500 Minutes,
This means that almost 2:00 Hours of ALF is just not there and we the Paying Public were LIED to by Lionsgate Entertainment.

So Buyers BeWare with Season 2 because it will probably be In-Complete Too.

2326574,5,B0009W5KJU,"It took a year to release season 2! Wonder Woman, Knight Rider, Dukes of Hazzard, Andy Griffith Show, Greatest American Hero, & Jamie Kennedy Experiment Got a sooner release date than the old Alfmeister! I was angry that they were releasing Project Alf (A real Let down) Before they released season 2, 3, & 4! But it got held back! Season 2 has 2 of the best episodes ever! The 45 minute Alf Special Christmas where Mr. Foley lost his wife, so he plays Santa claus and gives generously to a hospital and intends giving the Tanner family his cabin in the mountain.  He has plans to meet with his dead wife in the hereafter, a dying girl in the hospital gets alf as a special present, and Alf plays doctor to a woman about to give birth while trapped on an elevator, Alf is quite busy and so are the Tanner family out looking for him! This special alone is worth buying season 2! I'm a big fan of the show, so I am sure NEXT AUGUST When SEASON 3 GETS RELEASED! I will buy! HA! THEY KILL ME!",1118707200,2,988,4.2

Too bad we can't say the same for TV in the 21st century...I would/am embarrassed to even hear the crass language, not to mention the filthy themes of current TV.  Alf was just fun, and safe.

2326625,4,B0009W5KJU,"I enjoy and own this one and the complete first season...I cannot speak for what others are saying here about the syndication thing because the honest truth is even though I am a huge ALF fan I honestly hadn't seen him on TV since the late 1980s (how's that for sad? I did not grow up in a household with cable ;like some of my buddies did.) So I feel that I don't have no input on that one...I do remember the funny quips Alf would make on primetime TV right before a commercial break ex: ""Before you get up for that late night snack, I want you to know, I'll be right back!"" Alf in Season 2 is once again, loveable and exasperating to the Tanner clan; the grownups have less patience with some of his outlandish antics (like the episode ""Ballad of Gilligan's Island"" in which Alf is digging a ""lagoon"" in the backyard hoping to recreate his TV idols' stomping ground.) Apparently ALF still carries a torch for a Melmacian love interest named Rhonda, and his blind friend Jody makes another appearance in We Gotta Get Outta this Place. Alf finds out that he was born in wedlock and that is shameful on planet Melmac (wow, sounds about like modern day America huh?) and he retreats into a monastery but he's too big of a talker while there. we get to meet the Ochmonek's wise-cracking nephew Jake. There is also a bonus on the fourth disc, an animated ALF episode, ""Robin Hood"". Once again, I never had seen the animated ALF version any until then. Some episodes are funnier than others; there are times when you kinda get that ALF misses his home planet and succumbs to boredom and loneliness at times which could be the root cause of his acting out behaviors. Although there are times when ALF takes advantage of the Tanners' hospitality at times ALF has human feelings and all underneath it all; like desire to get a girlfriend, have a job, a life, etc. on Planet Earth just like he had a full life back on Melmac.
It's a shame that primetime TV nowadays is not this original and heartwarming; I am a fan of an animated show that has an American family living with an extraterrestrial who is a complete sociopath (ALF may be lazy, piggish and self-centered but at least he's not a sociopath.) Entertainment nowadays has too much supernatural, dark, violent material. ALF was my favorite primetime show growing up for its unparalleled mix of comedy, family values, wit, and sci-fi related humor. Didn't get any better than that at the time!",1425168000,,2442,4.527149321266968

2326656,5,B0009W5KJU,Can't believe this show is still hilarious to me. I loved it as a kid. I'm 33 now and just started to watch a few for nostalgia reasons. I plowed thru season 1 in a couple days and just started 2. They're great. Awesome writing for back in the 80's.,1379548800,,249,4.0
2326657,3,B0009W5KJU,"Just to reiterate what others have said, I too was disappointed about these being syndicated episodes and the fact that they were put out of order in the set. My episodes run only 20 minutes before the closing credits kick in. Most syndicated shows run at least 22 minutes. So these feel really short. But my reason for the review is to list the episodes so you will know how they are ordered on the discs for Season 2.

Disc 1: 7, 20, 1, 2, 6, 3, 15
Disc 2: 10, 5, 4, 8, 23, 9, 11
Disc 3: 14, 16, 26, 19, 17, 18, 21
Disc 4: 22, 24, 25, 12/13

Just for fun, let's say you actually wanted to watch the episodes in order...here's how your disc swapping will go:
1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 2, 4 Make sure to keep to keep your remote handy. You'll be hitting EJECT a lot!

I can not even guess why the episodes where put into the order they were. Somebody showed no attention to detail when they developed this set.",1378425600,,917,3.9193548387096775

2326661,5,B0009W5KJU,I absolutely loved this show. I watched when it first came out on tv as a kid and now getting to watch it again is reliving a part of my childhood. I definitely recommend it great for the whole family.,1376784000,,201,4.05

My wife and I are working our way through each season, and despite how much I remember, there are many episodes I have never seen until now. The creator performed flawlessly with ALF, and with the supporting cast of The Tanners, I think ALF could easily be put back on the air now and would still have his loyal following to help establish great ratings. Because of the way the show ended unexpectedly, maybe the injustice of this will cause enough of a stir in the right person or people to bring him back and satisfy those of us who would tune in without hesitation.",1369440000,,647,4.445378151260504

2326697,4,B0009W5KJU,"Let me start off by saying I'm 16. I have never saw any episodes in their original uncut ways, only when they did rarely did re-runs on cable. The fact that these episodes are of the syndication form doesn't upset me but I deducted half a point because it would be nice to see them in their full glory. The other half a point deducted came from the possibility that the episodes MIGHT not be in order. The first episode on the disk Brian had brownish hair and in the episodes that followed he had his blonde hair. On Wikipedia the episode guide lists the episodes in a completely different order then on the dvds. Then again there aren't really any story arcs so the order doesnt matter as long as the premier and finale episode are first and last, which im not sure they are. Anyway, as for the show, 5 stars all the way, family friendly, funny, and even jokes intended for older audiences. For example when ALF is imitating the Golden Girls to entertain himself he(as one of the golden girls) ask Blanche, ""who are you sleeping with tonight?"" to which ALF replies as Blanche, ""Everyone""
All in all, great show and dvd set but if you're over 25ish i can understand why you might be dissapointed.",1325548800,,1196,4.4409090909090905

I have several original broadcasts on tape and they all match up. As for the set up: the main menus are nill, simple numbers, no titles. The default language is of course in English and can be translated in others. The inserts are in German although, compared to the states' release, there's a description of each episode, ours doesn't have that. I bought the entire series in one box, and it has fur on it, lol. You can buy these individually of course. When I went to the German site (scroll to the bottom and you'll see the link) it offered translation, thank goodness. It took a little over a week for it to get here and that's standard shipping. So, it's worth a trip to German so to speak, I'm so glad I did.",1302652800,,892,4.347305389221557

Beginnings or endings of conversations are erased, often making them seem awkward. To those of us who remember the episodes as they were originally aired the aggravation will be really painful. I consider it a criminal act to actually sell a product like this, especially since there is no warning.

There is at least one other version on the market which has not been altered, but I have only been able to obtain season one.

I actually like this dvd, the intro Alf does, I thought was very funny, and for each episode, if you select the ? next to the episode, Alf will give a brief description of the show, It's just a little something extra but I like it. It's almost as funny as my Little Britain DVD that snores when left on the menu too long.

Whereas season 1 established Alf as an alien from Malmac, season 2 seems to develop Alf's personality and character. Among my favorite season two episodes are ""Can I get a Witness?"", where ALF is unfairly accused of throwing a football through the neighbors' window and the family has a mock trial, ""Some Enchanted Evening"" where Alf goes turns Willie's party into a costume party and goes as himself, and ""Hail to the Chief"", where Kate dreams of running for President against ALF.

This season is full of the most memorable ALF episodes (and memorable equals VERY entertaining).  ALF dreams of living on Giligan's Island (with MOST of the cast members from the original series--including the late Bob Denver), Kate dreams of her and ALF running for US President, ALF befriends a blind woman, and the crown jewel of the collection--the hour-long ALF Christmas special.  I can remember reading the newspaper article that this special brought ALF to new heights:  it gave him a #7 rating for the WEEK and may very well be the reason that his popularity grew to the point of warranting not one, but TWO Saturday morning animated cartoon series and the Marvel Comic Book title that ran from 1988-1992.

2326731,3,B0009W5KJU,"This series hasn't dated (apart from the clothing) The central concept is still very appealing. The idea of an alien crash landing through a family's house and becoming part of the family is still a great idea. This collection features all 26 episodes from season two (1987) and every episode is hillarious. The Christmas special is a two part episode; which is why this set has 26 episodes and not 25 as stated. the DVD menus are excellent with all new Alf footage. Alf will also tell you abit about each episode if you want him too. There is two bonus episodes from the ALF cartoon series. Overall this is a very good collection. It loses two stars because these are the sydicated episodes and not the full uncut versions. strangely though the Christmas two parter doesn't appear to have been edited; it runs longer by about 5 mins. The picture is also a little sharper on this episode. Did Lions Gate take this episode from the original negatives and not the sydicated ones? I don't think the Christmas episode will have been placed into sydication. If this is the case then how come this episode is better quality? I thought the original negatives were too bad to take copies from? Hm... If they can take the Christmas special from the original negatives (IE: Uncut) then why can't they take the rest of the series from them? I don't think they'll ever release this series again (uncut) so you should buy this set from Amazon and savour the old Alfer once again. Boycotting this DVD won't help, the studio will think there's no demand for the product and delete it.  Why would they release the episodes again (uncut) if there's no demand for them.  Of course we know different, there is a huge demand for the ALF series on DVD, to prove this we are buying the edited episodes even though we don't like it so we can watch the series again, some ALF is better than no ALF.  Think yourselfs lucky, i had to import this, ALF hasn't been shown in the UK for years and these DVD's haven't been released in the UK.  Why? I don't know.  This series was a big hit in the UK. It's just a shame that Paul Fusco and Lion's Gate haven't shown the series the respect it deserves.  Don't get me wrong, Paul Fusco (creater and voice of ALF) is a legend but he shouldn't have let his biggest creation be edited like this.  Another plus: The picture quality is very good and the sound has been remastered into Dolby 2.0. Now, all we need is for them to release Alf's hit talk show on DVD and we'll be laughin' Ha ha!

2326734,4,B0009W5KJU,"ALF is a very funny show.  His quick one-liners have me crying.  The episodes are well written and acted.  The episode where ALF tries to change his ways is quite funny, so is the one where he tries to boost the ratings of his favorite television program that's at risk of cancellation.  Many of my favorite ALF episodes are in this season.

The second season DVD packaging is much better than the first.  Discs are no longer piled on top of one another.  Pop in a disc, and you'll be treated to a couple minutes worth of the ALF Shopping Network, before being prompted to select an episode.  The menus are, once again, well constructed.

The episodes are syndicated again for season 2, but it doesn't bother me that much.  I didn't have the chance to watch ALF when it was new, so I don't know the difference.  Plus, ALF is no longer on TV, meaning the only way to see the shows is on these DVDs.  For a show like The Cosby Show that is still on the air, the DVD producers made a mistake by releasing syndicated episodes.  But in the case of ALF, it's the DVDs or nothing, so I'll take the DVDs.",1137196800,,1096,4.262135922330097

2326736,5,B0009W5KJU,This is one of the funniest series on TV and you gotta love that Alf.,1129161600,2,69,3.6666666666666665
2326737,5,B0009W5KJU,"Like other reviewers I share the slight disappointment that part of the shows were cut. However, in the UK we are not lucky enough to get repeat showings of Alf and so this dvd release is great! As I remember the series, it was only shown once on primetime and I failed to video all the shows, so it's super that I can see the episodes I missed. My children (16 and 14... daft names for kids I know) have really got into ALF - they love the humour and the wisecracks etc. Also, for the price, the dvd set is great value - even after having had to pay for shipping to UK. The set is outrageously priced in UK and so thanks Amazon.com. Nice one!",1127952000,3,643,4.070866141732283

2326739,5,B0009W5KJU,"Saw some of the Alf episodes shown in the U.K during the late 80s and thought they were fun! Don't quite know what possessed me to buy the DVD import from the U.S.. some subconscious curiosity I guess.. but I'm so glad I did! It's a lot more funnier now I'm older.. I just didn't realize quite how smart this series was! I'm not going to put down this dvd set, just because they're the syndicated versions, because I can't remember and/or missed most of them the first time round. What I don't know, don't hurt me, right?.. and I suspect the episodes are actually better and tighter for it. The only down side to the series, is that the family side of things can get a little sickly at times, but that's a minor fault. Cool, slick and highly amusing.. Alf is a superstar! This series is a work of genius!",1127174400,3,804,4.296052631578948
2326740,4,B0009W5KJU,"I used to love this show and would watch it religiously.  I'm buying this because it's been so long since I've seen it and I know I'll still love it, but I'm sure it's going to look very dated.  Alf himself is really cute, and he was funny and entertaining.  I'm sure if you're someone with little kids who've never seen him before, will love him and at the same time you can relive the good moments the show had.",1125619200,3,413,4.1375
2326741,3,B0009W5KJU,"If you've read the other reviews, you'll already know that the episodes on this disc are syndicated versions, not the original NBC ones. That's a shame, as my wife and I watched the show since Day 1.

It is nice to have them on DVD. Would it have been better to have the original uncut ones? Hell yeah. But I'll take this.

The comments by Alf on the DVD menus are pretty funny, and the blooper reel is awesome. As a long time Alf fan, I'm glad to see these on DVD, but my excitement is tinged with disappointment over them being edited.

The DVD intros recorded by Alf are quite funny. The bit about more FBI warnings made me laugh out loud, as did some of the blooper reel - to hear Alf (mildly) swear made me and my wife really laugh out loud). The syndicated issue aside, the show is STILL damn funny - there's no getting around that issue. :)

NOTE: There's a statement from Lion's Gate on why they have the syndicated versions over the originals online at tvshowsondvd dot com - look in their Alf section.

NOTE 2: This is almost the exact same review I wrote for Series 1 of Alf on DVD.  Since Lion's Gate showed no effort in putting the original versions on DVD, I don't think I need to write something different for my S2 review over my S1 review.",1125532800,24,1256,4.2343096234309625

2326743,1,B0009W5KJU,These are syndicated cut to shreds versions of a classic show. Worse than the first syndicated cuts that were broadcast. Entire scenes cut where Alf sings songs that the cheapo Lions Gate may have to pay rights for. This is what keeps video pirates in business.,1125446400,24,261,4.695652173913044
2326744,3,B0009W5KJU,"Yesterday in the mail I received my ALF Season 2 DVD, and I was disappointed. First epsiode I watched was ""Night Train"", and the scene with ALF and Willie singing ""City of New Orleans"" was deleted. Then I watched ""Oh, Pretty Woman"" and a very funny ALF impersonation of Dianna Ross singing ""Stop, In the Name of Love"" was gone. If you havn't found a pattern here, Lions Gate was too cheap to pay song rights. You would not honestly release a movie with parts missing, TV should be given the same consideration. NBC, Paul Fusco, or someone should have complete episodes, they should sell those and not these chopped up sindications. Lions Gate, be honest!!!",1125014400,13,656,4.663793103448276

2326746,5,B0009W5KJU,"Sure, Lions Gate released both seasons 1 & 2 syndicated, BUT WHO REALLY CARES? I have waited for some sort of ALF, in any way, for years, and just because some of it is gone, doesn't mean I'm not going to be happy. People should enjoy what they get while they can and stop complaining about cut episodes, at least your getting ALF at all.",1124755200,5,338,4.2153846153846155
2326747,1,B0009W5KJU,"I taped all of the original ALF episodes when they all originally aired. I still have them all and believe me if you could see what I have Vs these DVD Sets you would not go near them for free. There are major sequences missing that absolutely ruin all of the episodes on DVD. This includes Major plot lines extremely funny moments and absolutely very necessary dialog. Some episodes on the ALF Season 1 Syndicated DVD version had cuts as long as 5 minutes removed. Considering that they are only 24 minutes in Length, you are missing almost 1/4 of the episode. I cannot believe that they would issue out chopped up Syndicated versions again with Season 2. I returned my Season 1 DVD the same day I bought it. I personally showed the Store Manager the DVD version of an ALF Episode and my original Taped version of that same episode and she was totally appalled. That's the thing that really upsets me the Most. Good people who really want these and are going to buy them have no idea what they are really missing. Just imagine your favorite film of 2 hours length having 20 minutes cut out of it when you bought on DVD. That's exactly what's happening here. These DVD should never have been released in this syndicated form. Your are not just missing some DVD extra's, You are missing the whole Show.",1124582400,22,1301,4.493670886075949
2326748,1,B0009W5KJU,"Once again, I'll have to pass on the next season set of ""ALF,"" one of my fave sitcoms of all time, because Lion's Gate (and creator Paul Fusco apparently) have decided to give us more syndicated and shortened episodes in the Season Two set, repeating their huge mistake from Season One.

Don't understand why any company would purposely want to exclude a huge part of their customer base by releasing an inferior product, but I'm not gonna cry for them.  There are plenty of other DVD packages on the shelves, delivered with more artistic care and integrity, that I can spend my money on.  Shame on Lion's Gate and Paul Fusco! :(",1124064000,8,629,4.598214285714286

I like my shows uncut,like the Three's Company DVD's and Seinfeld. I emailed my protest about ALF and I know others did to,I guess the people that own ALF don't care about the fans!

2326751,1,B0009W5KJU,"I have been a fan of ALF from the start.  ALF desserves a lot more respect than what he is getting from Lion's Gate.  The excuse they give about the original air masters just does not wash considering the quality of the episodes presented on the DVD release of The Alf Files by another company that used the air masters.

Other TV shows from earlier times are being released in their complete forms.  Why can't Lion's Gate do the same?

I will not buy this set and urge others to do the same and maybe, just maybe, Lion's Gate will get the message.",1123459200,23,548,4.281553398058253
2326752,5,B0009W5KJU,"Ever since Alf crashed through the roof of the Tanner Garage, life on NBC Monday nights has been very funny! Willie is the dad, Kate is the mom, Lynn is their teenage daughter, Brian is their little boy, Lucky is the family cat! And then there is the over 200 year old Alien their most childish kid yet! He eats them out of their house, he spends more money on ordering junk that doesn't sell. He breaks things, he burps really loud, but he's an alright Alien in their book and he is funny too! Then there is the snoopy Ochmonics, watch out for the neighbors who take advantage of neighborly generosity, and are very snoopy and would turn their friends over to the Police in a heart beat or Alien Task Force to get Fame, or fortune on live TV! Then There's Ed Mcman! and David Letterman!
Season 2 has the best episode ever! The 45 minute Alf Special Christmas where Mr. Foley lost his wife, so he plays Santa claus and gives generously to a hospital and intends giving the Tanner family his cabin in the mountain. He has plans to meet with his dead wife in the hereafter, a dying girl in the hospital gets alf as a special present, and Alf plays doctor to a woman about to give birth while trapped on an elevator, Alf is quite busy and so are the Tanner family out looking for him! This special alone is worth buying season 2! I'm a big fan of the show, so I am sure NEXT AUGUST When SEASON 3 GETS RELEASED! I will buy! HA! THEY KILL ME!

Even thou the episodes will be cut down a little at least were getting this show on dvd. I do hope the packaging will be improved.
