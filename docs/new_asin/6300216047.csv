258435,5,6300216047,"The opening sequence of Barbarella is probably the greatest in cinematic history, who thought up the idea of a striptease in space? Whoever it was deserves an award for it sets up the theme for the entire film perfectly.  Mindless sex in futuristic settings, how fabulous. The plot is distored,  disjointed and at the end of the day pointless. But hey, so what...it gives  Miss Fonda plenty of chance to change her groovy costumes. Classic lines  and moments in the film are a plently, with some of the most classic scenes  being Barbarella being attacked by dolls with attitude and Barbarella  having a strange kind of ""virtual sex"" which leads to  ""hair-raising"" consequences. This is a classic beyond all  comprehension, it has to be seen to be belived. I saulte you all and offer  you this message..LOVE!!!",917222400,6,810,4.854014598540146

This film is based on a French comic book character and it exposes you to the wonderful world of the bizarre, 1960s era, fantasy film culture... and that's why I love it.

258493,2,6300216047,"If you look it up on Imdb, the plot synopsis will tell you that Barbarella is about an astronaut from the 41st century [who] sets out to find and stop the evil scientist Durand Durand, whose Positronic Ray threatens to bring evil back into the galaxy. But, Barbarella is really one of Roger Vadims excuses to exploit his then-wife, Jane Fonda, in a ton of sexual situations and skimpy outfits.

Joined by John Phillip Law, Anita Pallenberg, Milo OShea, Marcel Marceau, and Claude Dauphin, Jane Fonda traipses around outer space and various planets in ridiculous, if not adorable, costumes and shows the audience that the future is one giant sex party. She strips down in the opening credits, just to warn off squeamish viewers, and battles bad guys who literally use sex to kill people. Obviously, unless you're a thirteen-year-old boy, you're not going to take this movie seriously. Its incredibly stupid, but depending on your point of view, you might get a few laughs out of it.

I didn't really like the movieit was just a little too ridiculous for my tastebut if you want to see Jane Fonda prance around in go-go boots and a leotard, you can rent it. Shes drop-dead gorgeous in almost every other movie she made, so if your intentions are more honorable, you might want to check her out in Barefoot in the Park or Cat Ballou instead.",1506729600,,1338,4.68936170212766

258665,3,6300216047,"This is one of those movies that I was curious about for years and then finally got around to watching it. Barbarella is essentially a soft core porn with a science-fiction theme, based on a series of racy French comic books. The film is woefully dated (it's VERY 1960's) and cheesy to an embarrassing degree, yet also a lot of fun - kind of like the Batman television show from the 60's. If you're looking for a movie with a strong female character then this is not for you, as Barbarella might be one of the most submissive, objectified female characters in cinema history. The narrative mostly involves Barbarella encountering a series of situations in which she's easily captured, tied up, and put through bizarre forms of peril - like when she's stuffed into a futuristic piano that kills her slowly with excessive orgasms. She's usually either rescued or escapes the death trap with sheer, dumb luck. All of this in sexy, skimpy outfits that usually get torn off of her. Overall, I've never seen a movie quite a like this and I gave this three stars because it's unique.",1479427200,,1076,4.668421052631579

258693,2,6300216047,"More often than not, Barbarella registers as an endless series of psychedelic, glamour photo shoots. Director Roger Vadim strings along his leading star (Jane Fonda) from one flaky fantasy sequence to the next with most sequences providing no real understanding about what's occurring. Fonda, Vadim's willing participant, model, and muse often displays expressions of awkward surrender, embarrassment, and doubt. When the star of a movie appears confused, it should be a signal to the director that his picture is flagging. Issues like these won't make much difference to Fonda fans and oglers, but if most moviegoers can't figure out what's going on, it's likely that repeated zone-outs will follow. Kitsch and novelty are enough to sustain some viewers, but without any letup, the movie is reduced to nothing more than fluff. Despite the cons, there are some laughable images and attention-grabbing scenes. One of the most memorable is a collection of zombie dolls in the leaden act of attacking Fonda. Another is a poorly choreographed flight of an angel whose sluggishly flapping wings would be more useful for dusting countertops. Adding a bit of spice to the character lineup is Anita Pallenberg's Black Queen performance (who is reminiscent of Julie Newmar's Catwoman in the Batman tv series). Overall, David Hemmings is Barbarella's best asset. His cheek and talent offers up the most enjoyable sequence.

Many viewers have commented on the movie's inarguable ""cheese"" factor. Cheese in a movie can have its benefits, but here the cheese proves too soggy, especially in the music. The most ill-suited element of Barbarella is its soundtrack. Not only does it conflict with visuals and atmosphere, it also possesses the worst of late 60's pop with nauseating vocal accompaniment.

I admire Jane Fonda for trying to keep it together for the sake of the movie. The real shame is for Barbarella's original creator, Jean-Claude Forest, whose creation was given a disastrous half-baked treatment at the hand of distracted director Roger Vadim.",1471996800,,2045,5.269938650306749

It's a late '60s campy romp with ""Jane"" taking to the stars to fight evildoers. Yes, there is nudity, but tame compared to 2015/16 standards. This is 1968 folks, but still, if you want to know what a space movie with a lovely Jane looks like then, this is it for sure. Widescreen, nice looking transfer and Dolby TrueHD sound.
The only ""Special Feature"" here is the Theatrical Trailer.
Why it's not stated in the special features above the reviews is beyond me.
So, if you are bored and want a campy Sci-Fi movie to look at with a sexy Jane, try this.

She's GORGEOUS besides being the only good actor (or in her case, actress) in this movie!  My jowl dropped when I saw the first scene of Jane (Barbarella) removing her space-suit while floating around - her beauty continues to shine through during the rest of the movie, most notably in two scenes: 1. The see-thru tent scene where she's crawling around (or posing) in various positions, this scene doesn't go on for long, but it's mind blowing nonetheless!!!  2. The pleasure machine scene is just...WOW!! The villain plays the keyboard to enhance Barbarella's pleasure while she's trapped inside!  There's not much of her shown in this, but I must say, between Jane's facial expressions and the glistening of sweat on her neck and upper chest, I almost blew a gasket!!  She winds up being too much for the machine so it overloads!!  As far as the other scenes I didn't care for them too much...  didn't like that angel guy at all, he just flies around and acts like a robot or something with ZERO personality!!  But any fan of Jane Fonda will love this movie, even though it makes absolutely no sense at all!  You'll basically find yourself watching this to see Jane Fonda only, and that's definitely reason enough for me!!",1453161600,,1333,4.686695278969957

Andrews Blu-ray Review: My goodness, this is pulp science-fiction at its finest. Roger Vadim's cult 1960s sci-fi fantasy, starring Jane Fonda. A beautiful young astronaut uses the power of love to fight the forces of evil in the 41st century. Barbarella is best known as the famed French comic strip comes to glorious psychedelic life in this 41st-century space opera from director Roger Vadim. Once you get past Jane Fonda's infamous antigravity striptease however, the script turns rather dull and the imaginative sets steal the whole show as Fonda's nubile intergalactic bimbo experiences close encounters of the sexually bizarre kind. A pleasure machine, cannibalistic dolls and Anita Pallenberg's Black Queen help ease the verbal vacuum in Vadim's relentless visual assault, which is sure to delight some and prove tiresome to others.

The film starts out with Barbarella dressed in a spacesuit floating around in a zero gravity room with furry carpet on the walls and ceiling. She then proceeds to strip out of the spacesuit until she is naked, all still while floating in zero gravity and while a 1960s pop song plays. That 5 or so minute opening really sums up the film perfectly. After an in-flight anti-gravity striptease (masked by the films opening titles), Barbarella, a 41st century astronaut, lands on the Planet Lythion and sets out to find the evil Durand Durand in the city of Sogo, where a new sin is invented every hour. There, she encounters such objects as the Excessive Machine, a genuine sex organ on which an accomplished artist of the keyboard, in this case, Durand Durand himself, can drive a victim to death by pleasure, a lesbian queen who, in her dream chamber, can make her fantasies take form, and a group of ladies smoking a giant hookah which, via a poor victim struggling in its glass globe, dispenses Essence of Man. You cant help but be impressed by the special effects crew and the various ways that were found to tear off what few clothes our heroine seemed to possess.

The film never takes itself serious and it even makes fun of itself a few times through. I can only imagine this must have been fun as hell for the actors to film. It's pure light-hearted pulp B-movie goodness. Everything from the film to the poster art and misleading subtitle ""Queen of the Galaxy,"" this film breathes pulp sci-fi. The entire film, from the effects to the plot and also to the visuals, is totally light-hearted nature and experience.

Jane Fonda is of course is beautiful, but so are the great set and costume designs. They intentionally make Barbarella ruin her clothing so she can show off in a new costume. I found myself looking forward to seeing what retro outfit she'd put on next (partly because Jane Fonda is stunning, partly because the costume design is awesome.

Aside from great set and costume design this film, believe it or not, actually has some genuine artistic merit. The cinematography I found to be fairly good, especially for a film of this kind of nature, that is. There were some cool shots and overall the film is pretty visually appealing and I'm not just talking about Jane Fonda. The soundtrack has some great 1960s pop tunes.

It is sexy, it is camp, it is cheesy, it is funny, it is totally retro, and it is 1960s, oh so French-y, and of course it is of totally awesome fun.  And ultimately it achieves its goal by translating the erotic pulp fiction Barbarella comic strip it is based on to film. Though I personally have not read the comics, it seems that this is one of the best and most truthful adaptions I've seen. Of course the plot is very silly and ridiculous, but that's what makes it a great escapism film. Would you really watch this film for its plot? And sure Barbarella is not a particularly kick-ass heroine. She is very easily knocked unconscious and her best defence is screaming for help. But none of that matters, and it seems that all of it was intentional. And to those who think Barbarella is sexist, well sure Barbarella is kind of a helpless young woman, who uses sex to her advantage, but also for pleasure, but the original Barbarella comic strip and of course the film as well, I suppose did help start and fuel the Sexual Revolution in the 1960s.

Filled with bizarre scenery and over the top characters, the filmmakers introduced us to things like the Excessive Machine, an organ, if played with enough skill, will cause death from sexual pleasure. Bad guy, Durand Durand, has those skills. Sogo, the space port Barbarella is trying to make it to, invents a new sin every hour. Factor in the lesbian queen that can make fantasies become reality, giant hookah pipes, and every manner of cheesy special effects that 1968 had to offer and you will be glad you will spend 98 minutes watching this film. The score is brilliant of course, and dripping with 1960s psychedelic and sexuality.

Even with its flaws Barbarella, is a joy to watch. Its special effects are kitsch by todays standards, but are filled with charm and often very well done. The music is suitably swinging, jive and cool. The music is brilliantly composed by Maurice Jarre and this is one of those warts and all experiences that I would like to believe that no-one could truly hate. Surely everyone gets some level of enjoyment from this film, even if it is this joyously silly and daft? I cannot, in good conscience, call Barbarella a poor film. This is a work of some kind of pop art type experience and that is what matters. Its influence is spread everywhere from sci-fi, to music to even Avant Garde fashion designs. Barbarella is also the first science fiction comic book character to have a feature length film adaptation produced. Prior to sci-fi comics that had only been adapted as serials. When watching this film, I am always reminded at how boundary pushing this must have been in 1968. Regardless of the actual technical quality, Barbarella is a bona fide (hehe bona) cult classic of a film!

Blu-ray Video Quality  Paramount Picture's Blu-ray release of Barbarella is totally marvellous. Film grain is abundant, but in a good way. Every image is finely detailed and you can clearly see the unavoidable generation loss in shots that were subjected to an optical effect, mainly the opening titles. The rest looks pretty much like it was scanned from the original negative, which is the best of all possible worlds. The 1999 inferior NTSC DVD was bad by the standards of today, and it never resolved any of the grain problems or the fine detail, and this 1080p encoded image upgrade makes the colour-grading a total benchmark. It does, however, add a significant amount of information to the bottom and right-hand edges of the 2.35:1 frame, noticeably improving the composition of the image proportion shots. The DVD transfer was totally dirty, too, with lots of dust and even thick bits of hair clearly visible on screen in the opening moments and the source material was probably an inter-negative, and none of that nonsense is visible on the Blu-ray Disc. There is some slight damage, but it is only light, that you really have to be looking closely for you to notice. Thanks, Paramount Pictures!

Blu-ray Audio Quality  There's not much to grouse about when it comes to audio, either. Although the 1.0 Mono Dolby TrueHD soundtrack, is spread out across the two front channels, it sounds great at full volume, certainly obviating any need to buy a Compact Disc Soundtrack in hearing ""Barbarella Psychedella"" theme song, which you will be stuck humming for a week after watching this film. If dialogue can occasionally sound a little bit muffled, I'm sure that's a limitation of the original recordings, not the Blu-ray itself.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Theatrical Trailer [1968] [1080i] [2.35:1] [3:20]

Finally, this Blu-ray disc is classy from top to bottom. The most I can find to moan about is the decided lack of extras and there is just a 1080p Theatrical Trailer seemingly transferred from a soft release print, so there is a limit to what could be done even if Paramount Pictures had the will. This is still a great 1080p HD version of a film that most viewers would say doesn't deserve the treatment, and for that I'm grateful. If you have never seen Barbarella, you are in for a visual treat. A precursor in many ways to the campy, exciting Flash Gordon in the eighties Barbarella is a product of its time. It is not a bad film, but there is enough sauciness in the dialogue, sexual plot elements and sci-fi camp to be enjoyed by connoisseurs of this form of entertainment or to be warmly received by long-time fans of the film. This is an all-time favourite film of mine and seeing Barbarella once again, and honestly, I had a total blast and you will also with this brilliant sci-fi cult classic!  Highly Recommended!

The movie was innovative for the time. And one of the characters is Duran Duran the inspiration for the band by the same name.

In the 41st-century astronaut Barbarella (Jane Fonda) receives a message from the President of Earth (Claude Dauphin) and is tasked with a mission to track down a threat to the earth, the scientist Duran Duran (Milo O'Shea,) inventor of the ""positronic ray."" On her quest she must go through many trials and tribulations. We get to experience them vicariously. Put your tongue back in.

Will she find Duran Duran before it is too late?

When Jane looks back on her extensive career this will be her crowning performance. She never really re-captured that Barbarella spark.

I think that Barbarella inspired the opening scene of ""My Stepmother is an Alien.""",1436140800,,946,4.715151515151515

 I liked this one so much that I watched it at least twice at the big theater, the one you have to pay to enter, in the way back time when it came out.  Produced by Dino De Laurentis in an Italian-French collaboration it has that perspective on film making -ie- put as much skin as possible on screen, which they do.  Director Roger Vadim directed his then wife Jane Fonda in four films, of which Barbarella has by far the most notoriety and fame.
  The story has all the elements of an heroic adventure, but put 40,000 years into the future on the planet Lythion.  Instead of Conan or Hercules slaying monsters, we have Barbella slaying monsters-well, and robots too.  The kick is that when a fella helps her out, she helps him out, if you get my drift.  This remains a fun film to watch but in 1968 the main stream movie world had not seen the like.
 The film opens with a spectacular gravity free striptease that I believe solidified Jane Fonda as a Hollywood star forever.
 A French artist named Jean-Claude Forest wrote the original comic book along with Claude Brule.  A whole gang contributed to the screen play including soft core porn writer and Hollywood screen writer Terry Southern, Jane's husband Roger Vadim, comic book writer Jean-Claude Forest and several less famous scribblers.
 Jane Fonda has as her supporters such diverse talents as mime Marcel Marceau and Rolling Stones hanger on Anita Pallenberg.  John Philip Law plays Pygar, a fully winged angel that Barbarella shows particular favor to.  He was filmed in some 85 roles including a posthumous role coming out in 2015 in Citizens.
 Jane Fonda remains on the active list with a new TV show.
 Fun fact-In the film the Great Tyrant has a pair of nieces named Stomoxys and Glossina.  These are the names of two species of flies.  The film is chock full of odd bits of stuff that make it fun to watch over and over again.  I'll let you track down the rest.
 The special effects we take to be dated and they are, really, after 50 years they couldn't seem fresh.  But Barballea will still make an enjoyable way to while away an hour and 38 minutes.  The PG rated film gets a strong three saw blades, and this in 2015.",1432339200,2,2204,4.526582278481013

The bluray blows them all out of the water picture wise.
Second, if you haven't seen it, take my word for it that this is a fun romp.  Jane Fonda is wonderful in this role.  She won't win an academy award for acting, but this is not that type of movie anyway.  The special effects are the star.  Although they seem amateurish compared to today's special effects, they are delightfully imaginative.  The sci-fi effects sometimes look like they could have been created by a teenage Steven Spielberg, but don't kid yourself.

259202,4,6300216047,"I 've heard of this movie again and again both negatively as described as bad funny and positively as a sexy vehicle for Jane Fonda! It's over the top acting gets the most putdowns but the performences fit the absurdity of the premise of this outrageous outerspace adventure as Barbarella is on a mission to find the evil Duran Duran with his disintergrating Positronic Ray that theatens to destroy the peace and love 60s vibe of the Earth in the farout future of the Cosmos! Jane Fonda as Barbarella is like an outer space Mary Tyler Moore who finds herself in one sexy outfit after another just in time for it to get torn off some to reveal her sexy body! Like Mary Richards, Jane Fonda is adorable here and her outfits made me think of all those alein babes that Captain Kirk (William Shatner) would make love to before going ahead with his mission!

The costumes, backrounds and special effects have that 60s STAR TREK feel and look to them. When the blind angel Pygar flys Barbarella to the city ruled by the evil queen tyrant the queen while saying,""Hello my Pretty Pretty!"" reminded me of the villainess that BENNY HILL did battle against when he played the role of superhero ""Superteach"" vs ""Wanda the Wild, Wicked Whip Woman!!"" When the villainess queen is on top of virtuess angel Pygar she cried out,"" Oh if you could see how beautiful my things are! How do angels make love?"" Pygar said,""Angels don't make love, Angels are love!"" ""So you are a DEAD DUCK then!"" said the angry queen! When one of the revolutionaries has sex with Barbarella by using a stimulating futuristic pill , the 2 of them start tapping their feet while pressing their hands together and Jane Fonda's hair rises up into a fancy permed hair do as she is sexually aroused!! Both Benny Hill and Tex Avery come to my mind with this! Along with the surreal over the top humour there manage to be exciting moments of action: When blind angel Pygar carrying Barbarella evades lasers from the attacking city flying space ships and when Duran Duran starts to use his deadly Positronic ray to destroy his attackers!

The lake of ectoplasmic goo under the alein city has bubbles that ooze like a lava lamp! And as the evil queen explained,"" It has surrounded you(Barbarella) with a protective bubble because it cannot digest your innocence!"" This cosmic goo only thrived on evil so Barbarella apparently made it want to throw up! It all winds up weird, funny and believable in this odd, surreal film that is goofy fun! The creater of the comic book this movie was based on,Jean Claude Forest, was credited as creative consultant on this movie. I found this movie Much more enjoyable then Dino De Laurentiis's much later remake production, KING KONG! That remake of the black and white classic was rather depressing, lacking the adventure and charm of the 1930's original! Barbarella is much more fun and entertaining! I think there is good cheesy and bad cheesy and Barbarella is GOOD CHEESY! If MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 came out of retirement to make fun of this I wouldn't mind since I enjoy their riffing and verbal mocking of HERCULES UNCHAINED, HERCULES VS THE MOON MEN  and the GAMERA movies which I have their comic takes of these movies on DVDs!

Whether you praise this as funny sex space comedy or put it down as absurd nonsense I say it's goofy well made fun! The picture quality is overall very vibrant and colourful on this letterbox DVD and the soundtrack has a cool sixties music sound! Maybe after this review I'll watch both 60s STAR TREK episodes AND BENNY HILL episodes on tape and DVD!",1402704000,2,3581,4.6524486571879935
259203,4,6300216047,"For better or worse, there is no other movie quite like Barbarella. It's a baroque sex comedy. It's a psychedelic space adventure. Most importantly, it's self-aware yet undeniably campy. Penned by legendary satirist Terry Southern, based on the comics by Jean-Claude Forest, Barbarella is a gorgeous earthling who is sent on a journey to find Durand Durand, a doctor who invented a weapon too powerful for its own good. Along the way, she encounters a number of interesting characters, including a hirsute catchman, a blind angel, a revolution leader named Dildano, the infamous Black Queen of Sogo, and incidentally has sex with most of the people she comes in contact with. The story is surprisingly convoluted for what is essentially a soft core porno, taking away slightly from the overall effect of the movie, which is to make one laugh. Unlike many other movies that are considered campy, Barbarella was meant to be a comedy. Usually when a movie is self-consciously seeking these results, the outcome is pretty lackluster. But with the complete conviction of cast and crew, Barbarella turned out to be just what the doctor ordered. Jane Fonda is truly stunning as the titular character, and her performance is at least playful. The acting throughout is pretty silly, and the set designs are downright hilarious. Barbarella's ship is covered in wall-to-wall shag carpeting and there are too many overtly phallic objects to count. The music is suitably lavish and psychedelic in the best possible way. It's amazing how the soundtrack doesn't hold the same cult status as the film. Yes, the film is 'bad' in a conventional sense and totally nonsensical, but hell if it isn't a totally unique gem and a wonderful time capsule of the late 60's.",1402358400,,1746,5.0034364261168385

So I took 30 minutes and watched it, skipping a head several times - I just wanted to get this jist of it. The movie opens with Jane Fonda removing her space suit, very reminiscent of a strip-tease. (Jane's feminine characteristics are at a peak.) Then I tried and tried to find a plot. There IS one, but it is so ludicrous to be absurd. Earth society has evolved to one of pure love and self-indulgence. Someone has an evil plot to destroy the earth ( I THINK that's it) and only Jane can save the world.

Simply put, Barbarella is a touchstone on the late sixties sexual revolution that belongs to that category of movies that are so bad, oh so terribly bad  that it is good. Reportedly Jane Fonda now regrets making this movie which is a shame since she has never looked so good. Simply put Fonda looks so incredibly hot in this movie that as you watch the train wreck all around her, one stands in awe of this amazing looking woman. Starting the movie with a zero gravity striptease the viewer is immediately clued into just the type of movie they are about to witness, and this is a movie that is so unique, so unlike anything you have seen before that you will cheer its cheesiness or hate it for the same reason. The plot is unimportant but (as far as I could tell) involves the search for a missing scientist named Durand Durand (yes, the 80s pop band obviously were fans).But, the psychedelic visuals and Fonda overpower the proceedings that the plot is irrelevant.

Jane Fonda plays a stereotypical sixties-era bimbo (and admittedly looks pretty good doing it), but there's not much else to see here except a boring window into the warped idea of what the baby boomer 'love generation' thought was racy, radical and risque back in 1968. It all comes across as buffoonish, gratuitous and pointless, but in the pre-Maxim Magazine era I bet this soft core styled film sold a lot of tickets to pre-pubescent boys wanting to see a little skin action.

It begins with an astronaut removing her protective space suit while floating in the air. She gets a message from the President, Durand-Durand has disappeared after inventing a new weapon. This could mean war. ""Something must be done."" Her mission is to find him and preserve the peace. She is given a detector and a weapon. Her spacecraft will travel to Tao city in 154 hours. Something happened to the navigation system, she needs the manual back-up. She exits from the spacecraft after it lands. She is captured by twin girls! She is tied up and sees some walking dolls that click their teeth and bite her flesh. Help arrives to capture these young children, a Catchman. There is talk about scientific tests before making love. Barbarella dresses in furs.

She returns to her spacecraft. A winged man comes to visit. They go to a strange place, the labyrinth. People are exiled here. A pistol destroys one of the guards. Pygar regains the will to fly (after therapy). He transports Barbarella through the sky. They arrive at a new place and find new dangers. Where is Pygar? They are trapped and threatened with death. Barbarella descends to a lower level and meets the Great Tyrant. She finds Pygar and uses a weapon to free him. A captured Barbarella is placed in a cage with ravenous birds (parakeets?). She drops in at the Revolutionary headquarters. She touches palms with the leader. They have a map to the Queen's chamber. She sees women smoking water pipes and joins in. Barbarella is placed in a device that affects her emotions. The fuses are blown! She finds Durand-Durand (surprised?). Can they enter the Queen's Chamber of Dreams? They need the key.

""Nothing can stop me now!"" Barbarella is trapped. She explains what happened. The Revolutionaries destroy all the Guards. Durand-Durand goes to use the Positronic Ray to destroy his enemies. What can be done to stop him? The Queen has a solution. What if Durand-Durand's plan goes awry? Will if be the end of him? Pygar flies away with Barbarella and the Queen. You can surmise the ending.

""Barbarella"" was a French comic strip for adults. Does that make it a good movie? It needs a good story to make a good movie. Does this movie have any ""redeeming social values""? I didn't see any. Was it meant as a parody about society? Is this the kind of movie that makes ""science fiction"" a turn-off for many people? Jane Fonda went on to star in other movies during her career. She was married to a French movie director at this time.",1372118400,,2518,4.715909090909091
259447,5,6300216047,"Roger Vadim directed his then-wife Jane Fonda in a cornball sexy space-romp through the galaxy as virginal space pilot Barbarella. The film starts off with two cheezy minutes of Jane Fonda in full Barbarella gear, waking up in zero gravity, changing out of one outfit into another, flinging typography of the credits about, a weird period song strikes up, with then some lyrics: ""Barbarella, psychedella, there's a kind of cockle shell about youuuuu..."" Cockle shells are supposed to look sexy, right? Ha ha... The naked Barbarella gets a video call from the President of the Earth Federation:

""Love.""
""Love.""
""Just a minute while I slip something on...""
""Don't trouble yourself, my dear. Have you ever heard of a young scientist called Duran Duran?""
...
""One day we must meet in the flesh.""

A robot gives her a valve of liquid: ""Prepare to insert nourishment."" Crazy, man, crazy. Barbarella gets propositioned for sex, and in an easy going way she says ""Well, all right. But I don't see what good it will do."" She's felt up by bird angel Pigar, she sleeps with him, helping him recover his will to fly. An old man addresses her: ""You are of female gender, aren't you?"" Anita Pallenberg enters the picture: ""Hello, Pretty Pretty."" Barbarella hears screaming: ""A good many dramatic situations begin with screaming."" Jeez!!

Well, the plot is silly - Barbarella is tasked with finding Duran Duran, she flies through space, crash lands on a planet (twice), she gets into one dangerous situation after another, she is saved from death on many occasions by the intervention of others. Like Kim on 24 she's basically pretty useless, gaining advantage in situations by her mere presence and little else. She meets Duran Duran, but doesn't realise it's him, fights the Evil Queen in Sogo, the city of evil (named after Sodom and Gomorrah, not the Japanese department store chain).

It is not a movie for children (no way is this a PG- it was originally rated M for mature audiences). There is nudity and sexuality interlaced throughout the movie, and I must say that Jane Fonda was definitely in her prime when she starred in this (eye candy supreme). The bizarre scenes (including the metal-toothed biting dolls) could give kids (and adults) nightmares. There are some cute little blue bunnies hopping around though. The special effects are extremely funny, but that adds to the total feeling of the movie. In other words, do not view this film with a serious mind.

259588,2,6300216047,"You remember ""Barbarella"" as a sexy little camp classic, don't you. A bygone relic, a knowingly funny gem featuring an adorable, scantily-clad Jane Fonda and ridiculous special effects.

You're probably better off not watching it again.

It starts well. Turns out you were right about Fonda. She's beautiful, sexy, and has a too-good-for-this-mess intelligence about her that, at times, carries the movie. And it feels like a naughty pleasure to watch this version, which features enough nudity (including Ms. Fonda's) to warrant a soft R rating. But after the first 20 minutes, you're treated to slow-moving scenes featuring mostly wooden, joyless actors. You get a villain who's both unpleasant and rather dull - even in his hysterical, over-the-top final scene. You notice an odd sense of ennui, as if the actors were stuck doing overtime again. And you get an ending that doesn't really resolve anything. When it's over, it's just sort of...over.

There are nice touches, some hilariously bad songs (featuring some of the most out-of-tune singers ever recorded), and a few bits of psychedelia that will please the trippers among you. And there's Fonda, gamely making the best of it while showing off her lovely body. But if you want a TRUE guilty, dated campy pleasure, you're much better off tracking down Beyond the Valley of the Dolls or Flash Gordon (or, hell, the possibly superior Flesh Gordon).

Highlighting and choosing any of the the choices on the Menu Screen only sends you to the MPAA rating screen where you are forever stuck. The only way to exit anything from that point is to remove the disk from the player. So needless to say I have never seen this film since it will not play in my player.

Anywho, I can't believe that they had the nerve to put this movie out on Blu-ray in this condition. It's clear that they didn't spend a penny to digitally re-master this movie beyond transferring it. In comparison, H.G. Lewis' Blood Feast came out in 1963 and the Blu-ray is STUNNING considering that it was shot five years before Barbarella and for a fraction of the cost. No, I'm afraid that this was a cheapo transfer and I regret buying it, especially considering that there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING in the way of extras except for a horrifically grainy trailer which looks even worse than the feature.

259750,4,6300216047,"This is the movie Jane Fonda would just as soon have you forget she ever made. And it's a shame she regrets it, because ""Barbarella"" has become a cult classic. I'm sure she doesn't regret the residuals, if she's still getting them! This is a must-see, because whether she likes it or not, it's a classic.

The movie is based on a French comic book character who conquers the universe with her feminine wiles. Along the way, she meets some interesting characters. There's Mark Hand, who looks after the ice and forests of Weir, and who rounds up the children who live there once they reach a servicable age. After he repairs her ship, she rewards him in a very special way. There's also Pygar, the blind angel, played by John Philip Law; The Great Tyrant, portrayed by Anita Pallenberg (Mick Jagger's girlfriend at the time), and Dildano, the leader of the revolution, played by David Hemmings. All of these characters make for a very enjoyable film that endured the test of time. And, I must say, Jane Fonda looks amazing. The acting is cheezy, as should be for a movie of this type; the special effects are equally tacky (lava lamp effects...not what you find in space), but it all works.

The blu-ray transfer is very good. The colors are more vibrant and the high definition transfer makes details, missed in the standard DVD, stand out. I had to give this only 4 stars because they could have done something to improve the sound, which is highly compressed mono. Today's home theater systems are capable of much more, so uncompressing the sound would have been welcome. I can live with the mono sound, although Bob Crewe's music could have benefitted in stereo or 5.1 surround sound would have been nice.

Finally, to Jane Fonda: Please don't sell this movie short. You shouldn't regret making it, because it showed your range as an actress. Being able to pull off a cheezy performance such as this, when we all know how great an actress you really are, and were at the time, shows your abilities well.

The Navy base had censored Babarella somewhat but it was still a marvel for its cheesy sets, bad dialogue, sappy satire and its audacious bad taste. However, no matter what was censored, Jane Fonda was a luscious, lascivious delight! Another standout was Anita Pallenberg (Keith Richards former companion). Ms. Pallenberg simply chewed up the sets, the dialogue and just about everything else in reach whenever she was on-screen (but she could not devour our intrepid, brave Barbarella). I finally saw a ""complete, uncut"" version many years later at a midnight showing in a now-closed cinema in Greenwich Village. I and my group of friends and the rest of the audience enjoyed ourselves wildly. This was at a time when the group Duran Duran was just starting its ascendancy into superstardom so the film added a bit of contemporaneous reality to its otherwise dated and quasi-surreal plot.

259774,4,6300216047,"Before there was ""Star Wars,"" there was ""Barbarella,"" based on a French comic story by Jean-Claude Forest.  Sci-fi in theme, but quite erotic in nature, Barbarella (Jane Fonda) is an interplanetary traveller from Earth who is sent by the President to find and bring home Dr. Duran Duran, a scientist whose shipped crashed on a planet.  Along the way to finding him, she encounters a number of odd humans, including an angel (John Phillip Law).  Quite true to the comic, the movie carried over many of the adult sequences (with an exception of a risque encounter with a robot).

This is a delightful film, never to be taken seriously, and never to be considered high cinema, LOL.  It's pure (well, not so pure) adult fun.  And never has there been a title sequence in which they float all over the screen but it's pretty much guaranteed you will never even see any of them.  You will have to see the film to understand what I mean.

Largely psychedelic in nature, the story owes a lot to the adventures of Flash Gordon.  The movie is filled with bright colors, good costumes, amazing sets, fair special effects, and an excellent cast, naming among the, the famous mime, Marcel Marceau, in a speaking role, mostly unrecognizable as Professor Ping.

The video is excellent, very clean, and where there may be some softness, this was obviously in the original film.  It is doubtful we will ever see a better print of it.

Audio is good, with most of it front speakers.

As The Great Tyrant aka The Black Queen ( Anita Pallenberg, Rolling Stones girl friend) utters those immortal words,  we realize we are in sci-fi heaven. The wait is over with this stunning first time release to blu-ray of the 1968 cult classic Barbarella starring Jane Fonda. On my big H.D flat screen T.V the film transfer and re-mastering looks simply spectacular. Gone is the dirty dull print from the previous ordinary dvd release, here is the film in all its glory, with 4 minutes extra footage of flesh and frivolity. Its certainly not the completely uncut version that buffs have been praying for, but we must be thankful for a beautiful High Definition version. The opening sequence seems to have longer shots of Miss Fonda's ample assets, those assets the naughty title sequence letters previously covered up ..... or is it just wishful thinking? The restored and re-mastered transfer here is truly glorious in detail, its brighter and clearer, and the details are crisp. Gone are all the dirt spots and scratches, the blacks are black, and the colors vivid and vibrant.  The sound is great too, you can hear the Black Queen's switch blades cut through the air like a knife, and the fantastic soundtrack by Bob Crewe (on CD if you can find it) is so memorable.
The sets seem more breathtaking, and the futuristic costumes by Parisian designer Jacques Fonteray and Paco Rabanne seem somehow raunchier and even more way-out. Roger Vadim the director and Jane Fonda's then husband once said ""We want people to laugh with Barbarella, because she uses her body as a writer uses a pencil, as a means of self expression."" And today the humor in Barbarella seems as fresh and tongue in cheek as it did when first released, even more so. Of course Barbarella is camp and kitsch it was meant to be, but its also light hearted and fun, and a wonderful example of science fiction being spoofed. My other favorite film of this genre is Danger Diablolique also starring Barbarella's angel Pygar John Phillip Law. Barbarella has been a long time favorite of mine because I get the humor, I love the costumes and sets, and the performances by all the actors. Its a real trip too because it doesn't take itself too seriously, and its just stunning to watch on blu-ray. So thank you to the powers that be for finally re-mastering it. But please, lets see some extras and at least interviews with as many of the cast as you can. Even the still stunning Jane Fonda herself now recognizes  the film as a cult classic, and appreciates it more than ever.

259776,4,6300216047,"Dino DeLaurentiis produced a pair of psychedelic comic adaptations in 1968: Mario Bava's ""Danger: Diabolik"" and the high-flying BARBARELLA, which arrives on Blu-Ray in a marvelous high-definition transfer courtesy of Paramount.

Writer Terry Southern and director Roger Vadim were placed in charge of bringing Jean Claude Forest's French sci-fi strip to the big-screen, and did so by tailoring the project around star Jane Fonda, then Vadim's wife and who fits quite snugly into a bevy of tight-fighting costumes as the title character. Here, Fonda's Barbarella is an Earth astronaut sent to the far reaches of the galaxy in order to track down missing scientist Durand Durand (Milo O'Shea), whose Positronic Ray threatens the welfare of the universe by virtue of its sheer power. En route, Barbarella encounters a blind angel who has lost the ability to fly (John Phillip Law); engages in futuristic intercourse with David Hemmings' Dildano; butts heads with the ""Great Tyrant of Sogo"" (Anita Pallenberg); and becomes the subject of the ""Excessive Machine,"" an organ that generates feelings of arousal instead of music.

""Barbarella"" is very much of the era, no question, with its individual highlights being more satisfying than the sum of those parts. Barbarella's memorable opening striptease sets the tone for an intentionally silly, campy romp that features one of Fonda's more disarming performances and appropriately ""out there"" visuals and sets, credited to Mario Garbuglia but reportedly supervised by comic-strip creator Forest himself. Shot on Italian soundstages, the film has a unique artistic design, punctuated by stylish production design and outlandish costumes, and Claude Renoir's attractive widescreen lensing gives you plenty to look at throughout. The music is also a huge plus: Charles Fox and Bob Crewe's infectious `60s pop scoring functions in much the same way that Burt Bacharach's classic ""Casino Royale"" did a year prior, with laid-back, groovy melodies and colorful orchestral underscore working in concert with each other. The end title track, ""An Angel is Love,"" is one of my personal favorites, a vocal performed by Crewe and ""The Glitterhouse"" that splendidly caps the entire picture - not a classic, but still an entertaining romp for sci-fi/fantasy and comic-book aficionados, similar to how DeLaurentiis' big-budget ""Flash Gordon"" entertained audiences over a decade later.

Paramount's Blu-Ray of ""Barbarella"" looks just about perfect. Fine details, colors and contrasts abound in an AVC encoded 1080p presentation untouched by any obvious use of DNR. ""Barbarella""'s visuals are a huge component to its appeal and Paramount has done the picture justice with a wonderful transfer here. On the audio side, the DTS MA mono sound is decent - though a 5.1 remix would've been welcome - while the original, three-minute trailer (in HD) is also included, along with an attractively designed slipcover with fold-out artwork from its original promotional campaign.",1340236800,10,2995,5.464362850971923
259777,5,6300216047,"Barbarella Psychedella.  Jane Fonda and Roger Vadim's trippy collaboration based on an equally trippy French comic book by Jean-Claude Forest.  A 41st Century Earth envoy is sent in search of a missing scientist and is thrust into a series of Perils of Pauline style fate-worse-than-death scenarios that actually aren't too bad.  Quite nice, really...

For anybody in any doubt, this is the real thing.  Barbarella, as she was seen on the big screen in 1968.  Much has been made of a PG version of the movie, but this isn't it.  In fact, the PG cut has never been issued on home video - VHS, DVD or now Blu-ray.  What you see is what you got in 1968, rated R in some territories, X in others.  If you're expecting anything more racy or graphic than you've already seen, you may be disappointed but that's your problem.

If you're looking for a charming, satirical sci-fi sex comedy from the sixties this is it.  It's one of those movies, like Sellers' ""The Party"", or ""Casino Royale"" (1967), ""What's New Pussycat"", ""Modesty Blaise"" or ""Candy"" that could have only been made in that brief flowering of psychedelia in the 1960s.

My recollection of the version that I viewed in 1968 is that Jane Fonda was scantily clad. So I was initially shocked by the nudity in the opening scenes. But after the initial shock, I did not find the scenes offensive. Probably should have some sort of X rating.

There is a sense of lighthearted innocence throughout the story, and peace returns to the galaxy in the end.

The flavor of the presentation is that of a comic book. There is no serious acting, no gross violence, only superficial emotions, and no explicit on-screen sexual activity. No computer generated images that I could detect. Special effects are extremely low-tech.",1315526400,2,869,4.593548387096774
259811,3,6300216047,"I had never seen Roger Vadim's ""Barbarella: Queen of the Galaaxy"" until today,I had spent a good long time avoiding it, it looked silly, dated and low brow, which I was correct in assuming that it is all those things. It is also, however a time capsule of the swinging 60's, an often fun semi-send up of old Buck Rogers/Flash Gordon style serials,  a dopey sex comedy and a wonderful vehicle for the beautiful and young Jane Fonda, in all her glory, if you know what I mean. If sci-fi before 2001 was aimed at kids, then Barbarella was the first sci-fi movie aimed at frat boys.

Based on a French comic strip, the story is hardly worth mentioning, the plotting is muddled, but the structure is really nothing more than a series of vignettes, the best one involving David Hemmings as Dildano (love that name). Fonda is perfect for the role, although her much hyped nudity is more tease than anything els. However, she is still too good for this schlock, Fonda did the role, one can presume because director-co-writer Roger Vadim was her husband at the time. Vadim, it is worth noting, is easily the least of the so-called ""French new wave"" directors. The supporting cast ranging from good, Hemmings and Milo O'Shea, to oh, lord terrible (Anita Pallenberg and John Philip Law, come to mind, but in the latter's case, who could really play a believable blind angel found on an alien planet?). The special effects, look everyday of their forty-five years or so, the cinematography is adequate, although the lighting at times seem murky, the music dated and out of place (especially the Tom Jones knock-off title tune) and the editing doesn't help the movie's awkward pacing.

Still, as a life long film buff, it is one of the all-time (I hesitate to say great) cult classics and the beauty in Barbarella comes from all it's many pop culture references, but unlike a Tarantino flick, Vadim's is retroactive. All the ""in-jokes"" came about years, even decades after the fact, everything from the name of the pop band Duran Duran to the sex scene between Sly Stallone and a pre-Oscar winning Sandra Bullock (oh, my!) in ""Demolition Man"", all have their genesis here. This is what I mean when I say it's better been seen, than being seen, it is an important movie in some respects, but it is sometimes tough going (i.e. boring, even annoying) and can easily try one's patience.",1310515200,4,2369,4.703614457831326

She has improved greatly since I first saw this bomb at the local drive-in movie way back when I was courting my second wife, and before I was drafted and sent to Nam, where Janie made her biggest mistake when she became Hanoi Jane.  I still hear disparaging remarks about her whenever I attend a VFW meeting.  Those guys will never forget how she turned her back on us.

259835,4,6300216047,"Our story opens on Barbarella's spaceship, the Alpha 7, which is furnished, floor to ceiling, with light brown shag carpeting.  Earth tones evidently made a comeback in 40,000 a.d.. The first scene is a unique weightless striptease from a mostly aluminum color spacesuit down to the clothes that Jane Fonda (Barbarella) was born wearing. Presumably, Barbarella had just come in from a spacewalk. It becomes evident as the plot progresses that this striptease is as pertinent as anything else in the film.

Digression: One may have to be a certain age to be able to convey what they're going for here. In 1968, there was the sexual revolution and women's liberation accompanied by a genuine expectation for world peace in a generation or so. Which means... I am trying frame this. Of course there was love and lust, but we didn't have to fear it or judge it. We could see and enjoy the feminine form casually without an ulterior agenda. This was sexual liberation - this was the goal anyway. ...And that's why Barbarella doesn't even think of looking for something to put on when the video phone call from the President of Earth happens. End Digression.

The video phone call comes in from the President of Earth and Rotating Premier of the Sun System, Barbarella stands at attention and salutes. They exchange greetings and then Barbarella offers to put something on, but the President says it's not necessary because it's just government work. He has an assignment for her. She has to find Durand-Durand (not the rock group). He's a scientist. Weapons, which are outlawed by 40,000 a.d., will be required and so the President borrowed some for her from a museum. So we're off to extreme deep space, Tau-Ceti 16, which is on the way to Polaris - or something.

A stranger adventure than we could have ever anticipated lies ahead. End of storyline.

Some of my impressions: The music is dated but good. The soundtrack dubbing seems disjointed from the characters at times. The basis is eroticism rather than science fiction. Some of the futuristic ideas do have appeal. Some sets were thoughtfully built with care to detail, but some were not. Things in the sets such as shag carpeting were considered really nice at the time (I remember). The viewer seems to be the only one hoping for a science fiction classic.

There are some explanations; for example the director (and one of seven screenwriters), Roger Vadim, was in love with the lead. One doesn't really understand the extent of this love until one sees the film. And one tends to forgive the side effects of love most of the time...

In 1968 special effects were often borrowed from the stage, and dialog-driven science fiction was quite acceptable. However, there was a problem, as evidenced by so many writers. Perhaps the transition from comic strip to film is part of the cause. In particular, the scene with the flesh-eating dolls lends itself to a comic strip more readily. The reader of the comic strip can imagine the personalities of the wild children, the dolls, and the rescue; and make it work without effort. In a film, the director has to show all of these factors, make the decisions that imagination automatically makes when reading - and show them. Sometimes it just doesn't flow.

Regarding casting, the Great Tyrant and Durand Durand were great disappointments to me. On the other hand, I thought Fonda, Hemmings, and Sabato had particularly good energy and captured the spirit of the story.

Science fiction of this period had limited special effects. Sometimes it forced a film whose special effects were unintentionally comical to take a ""why try"" attitude. This may have happened here at least in a few scenes near the end of the film. I understand from my research that the original comic strip is much more dark than this film is. It would be interesting to see a remake that is faithful to the original comic strip and with better special effects; however, Jane Fonda will always be the Barbarella of the '60's.",1277251200,,3995,4.82043795620438

259840,5,6300216047,"When she was still young and gorgeous, Jane Fonda got the starring role in Barbarella. Barbarella is the main character in this film, who's on a space mission to locate Durand-Durand, a villain who's trying to take over the world. Barbarella wears outrageously sexy outfits, travels in a wildly decorated spaceship, and meets many strange creatures along the way, that she has to do battle with.

Barbarella's sex appeal is off-the-charts, and this film is oozing with a piping-hot erotic ambiance. Interestingly though, Barbarella has sex with other characters, in a most futuristic way. She takes a pill to 'tune-in' to her partner's psyche. And no bodily contact takes place during this sort of 'sex', except hand-clasping. Apparently, orgasm is achieved when the sex partners complete an ecstatic fusion, of their minds and souls. However, Barbarella does enjoy a sexual tryst via the 'old-fashioned way', with a man she meets during her travels.

Jane Fonda was brilliantly cast as the heroic, buxom Barbarella. Her on-screen charisma, is vibrant and compelling. Milo O'Shea as the evil Durand-Durand, does a decent job in his role. So does John Phillip Law, as the pure and gentle angel, Pygar. His perfect body and square-jawed, handsome face, made him a devilishly attractive 'angel'. Anita Pallenberg played the Great Tyrant, with femme fatale relish. The lesbian sexual undertones between her and Barbarella, were absolutely sizzling.

One of the best things about this movie, is the incredible special effects and gadgetry. Long before the flashy Star Wars series premiered, Barbarella contained some amazingly creative costumes, decorations, and scenery in general. The overall tone of this film, was deeply influenced by the uninhibited adventurous spirit, of the late 60s. Especially with regards to its bold, exciting sexual themes. For those who are Jane Fonda fans, and/or are devotees of 60s SciFi films, Barbarella is a fun-filled, juicy slice of 60s camp psychedelia.",1261872000,5,1987,5.321656050955414

For decades I had been meaning to watch this to see if Jane Fonda was as gorgeously displayed by Roger Vadim as advertised (and as reported by my horny friends).  Well, yes.  But the rest of the movie--high camp?  Interesting sci-fi spoof?  Satire on the genre?  Well, no, but there are some eyebrow-raising and rather bizarre flights of fancy by Vadim including some creepy children in an icy landscape who bean Fonda with a rock, knock her out and tie her up.  They have little dolls with piranha teeth that they sic on her luscious tied-up bod, drawing some very red blood to contrast with her white skin.  You get the picture.

Another interesting idea is that of the labyrinth containing the ""good"" people outside the city of all sins.  Vadim reverses Dante's Inferno and puts the angels and other people in hell while the evil doers live in their decadence in the not so fair city.  Fonda rides on the back of an angel with wings (John Phillip Law) while shooting down the ""leather"" storm troopers from the city in their flying machines.  Ka-boom!  Jane doesn't miss but of course she does get captured and...well, scantily clad Jane in chains or rather ropes in the city of evil...  You get the picture.

Roger Vadim gained international fame as the director of ""Et Dieu... cra la femme"" (1956) starring the amazingly beautiful Bridget Bardot.  He seemed to have a way with actresses, especially young, beautiful and aspiring ones.  It was quite a coup to somehow capture the heart or perhaps it was the ambition of the young and beautiful Jane Fonda.  One can see that part of his technique was to really put the lady on display.  Here in Barbarella, Fonda more or less undresses for the camera as the opening credits roll.  It's a kind of ""you gotta have a gimmick"" strip tease as she is turned upside down and sideways by the seemingly lack of gravity in her spaceship as she dodges behind the text of the opening credits.  This peek-a-boo would be quite titillating were I still 19 years old (or what the heck, 50).  Regardless the point is the full (as much as possible) display of Fonda who does indeed look gorgeous.  But that would not be enough, not nearly enough for the actress that Jane would become.  She exclusively holds the camera for much of the first part of the movie in her space ship as she re-robes, talks with the President of Earth, and moves about and begins her space faring mission looking for ""Duran Duran"" (yes, they got their name from this flick).  Her skin is flawless, her limbs elegant, her eyes beautifully made up in the dark sixties style.  The camera loves her, Vadim loves her, the audience loves her, Jane loves her.

To be candid I did not watch the entire movie.  But that is more a problem of age (mine) than it is of the movie which was at least as good as most sci-fi spoofs and a bit more creative.  However if you don't find Jane Fonda attractive, you won't even be able to watch as much as I did.

Set in the 40th Century - and seemingly a time where psychedelic ""blob"" patterns are really cool - Barbarella is on a journey from Earth to the planet SoGo to locate the famous Dr. Durand Durand (Milo O'Shea). The mission penetrates deeply into Barbarella; she has ""contact"" with a human resident on SoGo, meets and greets an angel, Pygar (John Phillip Law), and has an incredible experience with the Excessive Machine.

The tongue-in-cheek fun has propelled the movie into the galaxy of cult classics, with an orbit that defies time.",1233532800,2,725,4.838709677419355
259923,5,6300216047,"After hearing about this film for years, I finally decided to give the dvd a watch. I honestly didn't know what to expect, but I really didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did. I was familiar enough with the plot, which is ""Barbarella gets into trouble, loses her outfit, then ends up getting it on"". I just didn't think it would come together this well.

The charming Jane Fonda stars as a space navigatrix who must go to a far off and ""barbaric"" planet in order to discover what has come of the scientist Duran Duran (the 80s band that came along later named themselves after this scientist). Her quest is to discover what he's done with his deadly weapon, a weapon that could put to end the peaceful existence of Earth. Along the way she has several erotic encounters with various men along the way (and one near encounter with a woman).

The film may have been made to be thrilling at points (not in a sexual sense), but the film mostly comes off as a comedy. The sex scenes are equally amusing with some of the after effects being hilarious. (Barbarella's hair curls after one particular orgasm.) The sex scenes are pretty tame by today's standards, but there is a bit of nudity throughout the movie. (The film actually begins with a striptease to the movie's themesong.) Even with the numerous flaws, the film shines as only a cult classic can. This film is definately not for everyone & I'd honestly recommend that most people rent it before they but it. Some will watch it & buy it without hesitation, but some will find it's not to their liking.

259926,3,6300216047,"The Good Things
*The film has good video quality.  A few color shifts and particles on the print perhaps, but is mostly clear, sharp, and colorful.
*Some parts are actually pretty cool.  The angelic alien and the Black Queen are great, and there are one or two neat fight scenes.
*Some symbolism (particuarly some phalyc symbols).
*Acting is not bad.  A few good lines.
*The costumes are excellent (although some people may find them too outlandish).
*Some sets are great, with imaginative designs and props.  As noted below, however, other sets are awful.
*It is presented in Widescreen.  Includes English and French audio.

The Bad Things
*Some sets are great.  Other sets are just plain terrible.  Barbarella's ship is made of ugly brown shag carpet and moves in pretty lame ways to unconvincingly simulate movement. Another set was made entirely out of bags of air.  On the other hand, this may just be something else great to laugh at.
*Jane Fonda seems to act pretty well in this film, but her character is terrible.  She acts stupidly and shows hardly any backbone.  She's attacked by little dolls and birds, and she's so helpless! Maybe it's just the times, but I would have liked it much better if Barbarella was actually a strong and intelligent person instead of a ditz.
*The plot is unremarkable.  Barbarella has a task to find a mad scientists.  She winds up falling from one peril to another, almost always as a result of dumb luck more than anything.
*Not for kids.  Contains some nudity, a bit of violence, and other parts of implied sexuality.
*No subtitles.
*No special features.

The Questionable Things
*Some parts are completely laughable, usually unintentionally.
*This whole film must have been made by hippies.  Aside from the outdated styles, there's also a lot of talk of peace (""Now why would anybody want to create a weapon?!"" she asks...), love (""love"" becoming a universal salutation apparently), and free love (which runs rampant throughout).  The whole film is loaded with ideas like this; some people may enjoy them, others may hate them.  I found it very laughable.
*Special effects may be slick for its time, but are notably outdated.  It's similar to ""Fantastic Voyage,"" only worse.
*Goofy sound effects.
*The music is very groovy and upbeat, adding to the psychedelic feel of the film.  Some people seem to like it.  I hate it.

This film is so bad, you'll either love it or hate it.  The whole thing plays out like a sci-fi/fantasy version of ""Austin Powers."" There is a whole world of better sci-fi and fantasy, but if you want extreme cheesiness, this is the best in that regard.

I've seen a few scant bits of information, indicating that Robert Rodriguez is trying to remake the film.  He can't do any worse than this, so I'll be looking forward to it...",1219968000,2,2796,4.799163179916318
259927,4,6300216047,"""Barbarella"" turns forty years old, the year this is written. If anything, its silliness has just gotten sillier over time.

Fonda herself embodies the biggest of the changes since this movie was made. This stars the old, giggly, pre-feminist, pre-political Fonda, the one willing to strip-tease all the way down to her sweet self during the opening credits. Another set of social changes happened when the Sexual Revolution turned into the AIDS Era. Back then, sex was good fun between grownups. So, in keeping with the times, casual (but not challenging) kinds of nudity appear throughout. This flick stands as close to Buck Rogers as to the current day, so borrows from Buck in the subtlety of acting, complexity of plot, and depth of characters - i.e., not a lot of any of them. The effects show it a pure product of its own time, though: blobby opticals with mattwork that looks naive to today's viewers. Then there's the costuming - imagine Mardi Gras, I mean the part that attentive parents steer their kiddies away from, blocks away, then add a Hollytwood budget. Barbarella's Lucite bra (that must have been uncomfortable) and Duran Duran's ocean-liner outfit stand out, but hardly represent the limit of what appears here.

The movie starts with a cute blonde (the 1968 version of Fonda) luxuriously undressing in a fur-lined spaceship - pink spaceship, if you must know. Let that image set your expectations. Back then, it was daring but campy. Now it looks cheesy and campy, but I mean that in the nicest way.

259929,3,6300216047,"I can remember standing in a long line to get in to see this movie back in 1968, the year it was originally released.  I was 12 years old, and my dad had dropped off me and my best friend, thinking that we were going to watch another juvenille sci-fi extravaganza, for which I had developed an extreme fondness.  It was the dead of winter and there was snow falling, but we perservered, having heard that we would have the opportunity to see Jane Fonda buck naked, and, above all else, we wanted to be the first in our school to lay claim to that dubious achievement. However, the lady in the ticket booth had other ideas.  Although we were 12 years old, we looked no older than 9 or 10, which didn't matter anyway, since we needed to be 16 to get into the movie.  So, we didn't see ""Barbarella"", or Jane Fonda's flaunted nudity, and my father had to immediately turn around and make an 18 mile drive back to pick us up in falling snow, with my mom lecturing him, loudly,  all the way home about ""parental responsibility"" and ""pornography"".  And so it was that, 40 years later, give or take, I decided to order ""Barbarella"" from Amazon and find out what the fuss was all about and why I couldn't get into see this movie back when it first came out.

Well, for starters, there is nudity, for sure, but it's often fleeting and almost demure.  There are breasts, a glimpse of buttocks, and...wait...was that what it looked like?  Hard to tell and, at this stage, even harder to care.  Jane looks good in the title role and she's funny; ""Barbarella"" may have been the last time that she was allowed to demonstrate any comic ability in a film for almost a decade.  Sure, she was sensational in ""Klute"", perfection in ""Julia"" and ""Coming Home"", but she was a lot more fun in ""Barbarella"".

There's not much plot worth writing about.  Barbarella is a sort of agent for the planet Earth,  who drifts through the universe correcting wrongs and fighting evildoers.  She travels in an outrageous spaceship driven by a computer that talks to her (not unlike HAL in ""2001""). The always watchable David Hemmings is on hand as handsome Dildano, with whom she engages in a literal hand-to-hand sex ritual; hirsute Ugo Tognazzi engages her the old-fashioned way, leaving her sated and singing.  And John Phillip Law is both blind and blonde as the angel Pygar, who manages to offend the Black Queen (Anita Pallenberg) by rebuffing her sexual advances, proclaiming, ""An angel doesn't make love, an angel is love.""

It's all very silly and tastefully lewd, on a sophomoric, 60's-era, ""Tonight Show"" level (and don't get me wrong, I loved Johnny Carson and my dad was the ""Tonight Show's"" biggest fan).  Despite the presence of some very big names of the time, it doesn't add up to much, and a certain degree of tedium creeps in after awhile.  Still, the acting is tongue-in-cheek, the sets are wacky and colorful, and there is a sexy innocence about the whole enterprise that strikes me as being very much in context with the times; in that respect, though worlds apart, Antonioni's ""Blow Up"" has some of that same carefree attitude.  Director Roger Vadim (Fonda's then-husband) seems to embrace the spirit of the '60's without ever imbuing his film with much substance.

The quality of this DVD seems variable, for some strange reason.  There are scenes where the colors are beautiful and vibrant, and suddenly the scene is transformed into a muddy murk, before the vibrancy just as suddenly returns.  It doesn't really interfere with the enjoyment of the film; ""Barbarella"" is much too slight to be affected by minor color distortions.

Was it worth waiting 40 years to see?  For me, the answer is yes, but mainly as a curiosity piece more than anything.  It's not great cinema by any means, but it holds a nostalgic place in my mind of a time that is so radically different from the world we're currently living in, as to seem almost inconceivable.  ""Barbarella"" is my own proof that 1968 did, indeed, exist, that it wasn't a beautiful fable where people still had audacious dreams and the courage to pursue their beliefs.",1218067200,47,4106,4.650969529085873

259988,4,6300216047,"Talk about campy sci-fi movies, this is probably number one!  This 1968 film stars Jane Fonda and is directed by her husband at the time, Roger Vadim.  It was taken from a popular French comic book.

The movie begins as 41st century astronaut, Barbarella (Fonda) does a zero gravity strip-tease.  When she finishes (credits are blocking the good parts for the guys), the President of Earth comes on the screen and tells her she must look for lost astronaut, Dr. Durand Durand in the galaxy.  You could see where the 1980s pop-band, Duran Duran got it's name from (slightly spelled differently), they even had a song called ""Electric Barbarella"" to honor this movie.

Barbarella lands on the planet Lythion and tries to locate the evil Dr. Durand Durand.  She encounters scary children that force their ""Chucky"" looking cannibalistic dolls on her that tear her fishnet stockings and draw blood.  She is told by the catchman (a person who catches bad children) that Durand Durand is probably in the city of Sogo.  She asks what she could do for the catchman since he gave her this bit of information, he told her he wanted to have sex with her the old fashion way, not by the way their psychocardiograms align, so she does and then off to Sogo.  She crashes her spaceship shortly after and then meets Pygor---a blind winged-angel that she also has sex with.  She convinces Pygor to fly her to Sogo, where she finds a new sin is invented every hour. Barbarella discovers a sex organ-like instrument called the Exessive Machine, where an accomplished person, in this case, Dr. Durand Durand himself, can drive a victim to death by pleasure.  She also encounters a lesbian queen (Anita Pallenberg) who, in her dream chamber, can make her fantasies take form. The weirdest encounter was a group of ladies smoking (just think of the 1960s) what appears to be a huge bong where a guy is in the glass globe part of the bong floating around. Barbarella asks what they are smoking and the ladies reply, Essence of Man. She nods and continues smoking.

For its time the special effects might have been something, but to nowaday standards it is reminiscent of Plan 9 from Outer Space.  The plot was not the easiest to follow, I was lost a couple of times.

This movie is definitely not one of my favorites, but I appreciated how this film was innovative for its time.  And for that it deserves you to watch it.

 My favorite scene is ""The Excessive Machine"".  Jane is put in this 'organ' and stripped of her costume.  The machine is meant to pleasure you to death.  Jane Fonda is great here.  She sells this scene for all it's worth.  Soon, she is covered in sweat, and we get many close-ups of her face, as she gives in to the pleasure.

260036,5,6300216047,"The 1960's were an era of terrifically beautiful actresses, ranging from Ursula Andress to the starlets of Hammer Film Productions.  Among the highest order of cinematic goddesses was young Jane Fonda, whose performance in the title role of ""Barbarella"" remains extremely erotic--today's more explicit sexuality notwithstanding.  The film's slight storyline concerns a futuristic ""astro-navigatrix"" trying to track down a mad scientist and prevent him from using a horrific weapon that he invented.  Hot on his trail Our Heroine encounters all manner of intergalactic beings who do their best to separate her from her unusually frail space-girl costumes; a blind angel, sadistic ""leather men,"" children w/carnivorous dolls, and a tyrannical lesbian queen are all eager to entice Barbarella into their various fun & games.  Finally, when the space-girl does catch up to her quarry (the crazed scientist wonderfully named Duran Duran) he too wants to work out his fantasies on her; he subjects her to his ""excessive machine""--a pleasant torture device that supposedly kills by inducing a lethal number of orgasms!  Fortunately, Barbarella's [...] capabilities outlast the machine, causing it to collapse in broken fuses.  And so it goes until the less-than-inevitable, but happy, finale.
  All in all this film's fantastic episodes are brilliant, inspired.  Barbarella's narrow escape from flesh-eating dolls as well as her many encounters with the lesbian tyrant (played to the hilt by Anita Pallenberg) are truly imaginative sequences.  Other highlights include the film's initial scene--with Barbarella doing a strip-tease in a zero-gravity chamber; and her down-and-dirty defeat of Duran Duran's nasty machine.  In essence there are very few dull moments in the entire film.  Director Roger Vadim--Jane Fonda's husband at the time--was at the height of his considerable powers.  And Mistress Fonda herself was glorious; in such an unlikely role, her extreme beauty blended harmoniously with an essential innocence in a way that made her the cinematic descendant of Marilyn Monroe!

260063,5,6300216047,"""Barbarella"" next to ""Cat Ballou"" has to be Jane Fonda's signature film. What's amazing about both of those movies is that Fonda is playing the same role as the boot-wearing, gun-loaded, desperado heroine (even though they're in different genres) and they may be the two deepest roles that she's ever played. Looking through the still photos to this film Fonda's performance is almost like Dustin Hoffman in ""The Graduate"": It was a lightingbolt of a role that cascades on not only the movies, but pop culture in the late-60's. I agree with Jeff from Portland: The picture on the DVD is great and I believe this film needs to be re-released and be loaded with special features. There are two things I take notice on this: How great it looks (for which I have gone over) and the costumes. Out of all the costumes that Fonda wears the one that I'm floored by is the one where she wears a white unitard with breastplated armor and a black cloak wrapped at the back, a red utility breif belt, and black boots with the red stripe down the middle (not only that but it came with red fold-down crowns on the top of the boots; creating a stirup look like you would see on a baseball uniform). Seriously, should that unitard be in leather and not in cotton/spandex? Given the fact that it would be torn up in the scene between Fonda and the birds. On a personal note, I'm getting sick of hearing most of these reviewers here still badmouthing Fonda for what she did against Vietman. Those people should get a life (not to mention a brain) and realize that Muhammad Ali did the same thing and he almost went to jail and couldn't fight for two years while Fonda was no where near there. Where's the outrage in that? Anyway, back to the movie. I think it deserves to be a sci-fi classic while it has to come out as a Special Edition DVD.

Jane is magnetically sexy (accentuated by great costume design including thigh-high boots, fishnets, skin-tight unitards, etc.) and what ultimately draws me to mulitple viewings of this film.

The story, while usually not important for this kind of movie, is actually somewhat original and made interesting by Jane Fonda's devotion to her role and the sometimes hysterical dialogue.  The acting, for the most part, is average in this movie, but Jane is brilliant and so is Anita Pallenberg in a small role as the Great Tyrant/Black Queen (""My Pretty Pretty"").  Anita is also exceptionally beautiful and incredibily sexy.

Notes on the DVD:  While it lacks any special features, the picture is great (although occasionally grainy) and it shows off the wonderful cinematography, great colors, and stylistic set designs (and the wonderful Jane Fonda, of course).  I first saw this movie on AMC and it was somewhat edited, but the DVD thankfully restores the nudity, which is not entirely important but adds to the ambience that makes the film great.

260070,1,6300216047,"A while back, I saw Ed Wood's ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" and came away thinking how justified the claim of ""Worst Movie Ever Made"" was. Everything about that film was bad, and it single handedly redefined how wrong things could go when trying to tell an effective story. However, my opinion of it changed after seeing ""Barbarella."" Make no mistake; ""Plan 9"" is still awful. However, I eventually came to see that, for all its shortcomings, it at least managed to stay true to what it set out to accomplish: to give a social statement in the guise of a science fiction story. Had the makers of ""Barbarella"" even attempted to do this, it might have been an enjoyable and campy romp.

Unfortunately, this was not the case. In my humble opinion, ""Barbarella"" ranks right up there with ""Plan 9,"" and not in the way you might be thinking; at least the latter was so bad that it was good. ""Barbarella"" was just plain bad, from the very first frame to the last.

This erotic science fiction/fantasy-based on the stories of Jean-Claude Forest-is one of Jane Fonda's earliest film roles. Maybe she wanted to get this film out of her system before tackling more serious, or at the very least, less ridiculous projects. I would certainly be embarrassed if I were in her place, especially since she has gone on to become a highly respected actress (with a couple of Academy Awards to show for it). In all likelihood, she was cast only because she was at that time married to the director, Roger Vadim. I suppose everyone has to start somewhere (but at least it should be somewhere worthwhile).

The plot is simple, if even relevant. In the incredibly distant future, Barbarella, the ""Queen of the Galaxy,"" is recruited to track down the brilliant earth scientist, Durand Durand (Milo O'Shea), and recover a secret weapon of his design. During her quest, she crash-lands on a planet ruled by the Great Tyrant (Anita Pallenberg), a dominatrix type woman who constantly refers to Barbarella as ""Pretty, Pretty."" Barbarella also meets Pygar, a blind angel played by John Phillip Law (who was obviously picked for his looks rather than his talent). From there, it goes from one silly, half naked escapade to the next, culminating in an ending so excruciatingly ill conceived, it's not even funny.

The overall look of the film made me want to punch the production designer square in the face. Absolutely everything was tacky and cheap. The worst looking shots were those of outer space, if they can even be described that way at all. Instead of the common representation (an inky backdrop dotted with twinkling stars), we are shown a formless mass of viscous goo photographically combined with sparklers and various lighting effects. It's not genuine space; it's a universe trapped in a container of hair gel. And let's not forget the interior of Barbarella's ship, which was covered from floor to ceiling with dingy shag carpeting.

Describing the characters would require a lengthy reach and a boatload of speculation. This is because there is absolutely no character development; everyone in this film slides through as heartlessly as a ride vehicle passing through a room in a funhouse. Indeed, a funhouse is exactly what the film feels like (albeit, it's a heavily drug induced funhouse).

The best one has to work with are the characters' physical appearances, which amounts to nothing more than sexy eye candy. Case in point: Barbarella. There is no question that Jane Fonda had the body for this part, and the filmmakers certainly wasted no time in somehow showing it off. The very first scene is of her stripping out of a spacesuit while floating in zero gravity. While certain risqu glimpses make their way through, most of her body is covered with the jumbled letters of the opening credits. The rest of the film has her shifting from one skimpy costume to the next, being that she somehow keeps conveniently losing them. One of them was bitten away by demonic dolls with a taste for human flesh (at which point I couldn't help but laugh at the thought of Disneyland's ""it's a small world""). Another was sucked out through a pipe as she's being ""pleasured to death"" by an orgasm-inducing keyboard instrument. I may have lost count, but I think that by the end of the film, Barbarella had gone through seven costume changes, a trait reminiscent of Queen Amedala in ""Star Wars: Episode I."" Did any of it matter? Not really. It was only done to show off Jane Fonda's body: never mind adding something meaningful to the plot.

One of my biggest beefs with this film is its poster. It's annoyingly deceptive in terms of the film's genre. Seeing it automatically leads one to believe that the film is a classic science fiction adventure. True enough, we are shown distant planets, spaceships, and various weapons utilizing technologies that exist only in the imagination. However, it looks and feels too different; the continuous appearance of swirling psychedelic backdrops and exposed female anatomy makes it seem more like a sexually charged acid trip than a science fiction story. It was like going into the mind of Hunter S. Thompson and getting ringside seats for his private fantasy. Trust me when I say that that very quickly loses its appeal.

At this point, let me return to ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" for just a moment. Is it a good film? Not by any stretch of the imagination. But is it at least mind-numbingly entertaining? Certainly. It's failure to succeed in every way made it fun. But ""Barbarella"" was no fun at all. It's nothing but a gigantic mess, from its style to its performances to its blatantly inappropriate music.

Interestingly, while living in France, I bought a bunch of Barbarella paperbacks out of curiosity and discovered to my delight that the movie is actually very faithful to the original comic - even the dialogue follows the crytptic utterances of the characters closely.

Fonda is perfectly cast.  She is stunningly beautiful in youth, at the apex of her stardom in many ways, and you can tell she is having fun with this role.  But the acting of the others is also very good and fun, from DuranDuran to the sexualised angel in his nest.

260153,5,6300216047,"I remember vividly the first time I saw that film. It was in 1978 and I was only 10 years old. I was trying to find something to watch on television and then, saw the first scene at the beginning where a woman in a space suit strips, ending up completely nude. The scene begins as the space ""bubble"" on her head gradually lowers, revealing Barbarella's face for the first time. Breathtaking is not strong enough a word. In my opinion, she was the most beautiful creature I had ever seen up until that time and I was instantly hooked.
The combination of the music, which is also a very strong element here, in total harmony with the highly satirical tone not to mention those cheesy sets are all dead-on perfect. Everything was put there to create a world where a highly sensual creature like Barbarella could flourish. Jane really knocked all my senses in terms of feminine beauty in this movie. She looks like some living Barbie doll, with breathtaking features and a gorgeous mane of thick blond hair: the perfect sex kitten always eager and ready for sex.
This is a truly wonderful performance from a great actress. She deliberately plays the character as a ""bimbo"" while letting the audience in on the joke. Here is this very intelligent woman playing some ""nymphet"" in the most convincing way possible.  She ends up sleeping with practically every man she encounters even though the sex is only suggested through some clever images. And all the while, she lets the audience knows in very subtle ways that she's acting in parody mode.  That is probably the most interesting aspect of her performance. Even with simple lines like ""Oh"", ""But that's monstrous!"", ""That's nice"", she succeeds in delivering them completely ""straight"" with just the right amount of tackiness as if to say ""don't take any of this seriously, just have a good time..."". There are countless classic lines here and I can admit I know them all by heart.
 Roger Vadim who also transformed another former wife ""Brigitte Bardot"" into a sensation in 1957 with ""And God Created Woman"", did the same trick some 10 years later with Jane. ""Barbarella"" is an erotic comedy disguised as a bad sci-fi movie. Everything in it is tacky: the clothes, the sets, the plot, the acting... But the big difference between this and a truly bad movie is that it is tacky ""on purpose"". Therefore, it becomes a camp movie which defined itself as such before any critic could do it. Roger knew exactly what he was doing and succeded on every front.
 I must say it is in my top ten list of my favorite movies of all times. I have seen it at least 50 times over the years and for some reason, the movie easily bears the repeated viewings. Sure, the story might seem quite silly to some but that's beside the point. If you view this on the first level, you will probably find it all quite ridiculous and farfetched to the extreme. But if you look at it closer, you'll realize just how well-conceived it is. I won't tell you about the plot as I feel it has been covered already in previous reviews. The plain fact is that the story mainly serves the purpose of displaying Jane as Barbarella in all her youthful glorious beauty in one skimpy costume after another.
 I can not recommend this movie enough. If you like camp movies, you will love this one. And even if you don't usually enjoy fanfares created for no other purpose than to entertain the hell out of us, you can at least bask in Jane Fonda's beauty here seen at the age of 29. Just for the chance to stare at that perfect face and body is worth the price alone.",1014249600,22,3568,4.542768273716952
260154,4,6300216047,"You can't get much more bizarre than this sexed-up but super-silly saga of an intergalactic secret agent sent to a rebel planet to find a mad scientist named Duran Duran. The story is extremely flimsy and seems to have been created largely in order to showcase new and increasingly strange ways of stripping off most of Jane Fonda's clothes--and in this the film succeeds extremely well, beginning with Fonda's ""weightless"" striptease over the title credits and finally fetching up with Fonda disrobed by the evil Duran Duran's fiendish orgasmatron.  The costumes, sets, and special effets are swinging 60's at their most excessively fab; the cast is so relaxed that you may think they're performing under the influence.
No one in the cast takes this film seriously, and neither should you. BARBARELLA has all the intellectual depth of a pancake,  not so much flatly funny as merely amusing and appealing to a truly high-camp sensibility. As cult movies go, however, it rates very high--give a party and show it on a double bill with FLESH GORDON!",1010275200,5,1047,4.977142857142857
260155,4,6300216047,"BARBARELLA is one of a few cult films that can be called a ""Holy Grail"" of cultdom.  Jane Fonda's titillating sci-fi adventure is an endless, trippy delight.
Barbarella is a futuristic girl from Earth who is called on to retrieve Duran-Duran, a noted scientist, from the evil planet of SoGo.  On her perilous (and quite sexy) journey she teams with blind angel Pygar (John Phillip Law), and battles the Black Queen (Anita Pallenberg) along with various sexual torture devices.
The film is hilarious, from the Black Queen's catch-cry of ""pretty pretty pretty"" to the hoard of evil children with what look like rabid Cabbage Patch dolls.  Barbarella's anti-gravity striptease during the opening credits is a hoot, too.
BARBARELLA was directed by Roger Vadim (then the husband of Jane Fonda), and is full of vintage 60's retro influence.
The DVD also includes the trailer.",1001548800,16,869,5.062937062937063
260156,5,6300216047,"This film, along with other stunning classics such as ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls,"" are sure proof that the age of really, really bad yet good films is behind us.  Set in the 41st Century, the hypersexual Barbarella goes in search of the evil renegade scientist Duran Duran and manages to stumble across what must be the grooviest planet this side of ""Vegas in Space.""  In her quest to find Duran Duran (""Pardon me, but do you know Duran Duran?""), Barbarella manages to shag half the planet and pique the prurient interest of the evil, yet uber-sensual bisexual queen (""hello, my pretty, pretty"").  After demolishing the amazing Orgasmatron and getting herself locked into the queen's funky chamber of dreams, Barbarella saves the day with a bubble of goodness and some help from her blind angel friend Pygor.  The unbelievably bad acting in this film is very well counterbalanced by the fabulous Pucciesque fun fur sets and amazing special effects (i.e. Everytime Barbarella has an orgasm her hair instantaneously perms itself!)  It's impossible, given our current climate of cynicism, to produce good quality camp like this today.  All attempts to reproduce a movie this overwhelmingly bad would just have to fail.  Yet, I cannot recommend this film highly enough - run, do not walk, to see it.",993168000,79,1300,4.9631336405529956
260157,5,6300216047,"This spine-tingling inter-galactic adventure of the Queen of deprived sexual instinct is a long time favorite of illegal migrant farm workers in the US southwest. Baffled by the concept of physical pleasure, clueless, careless, and Vadimized beyond belief, our acquiescent heroine plies her considerable gifts to save the universe from forces evil. The cheesey special effects are drop-dead perfect, even by contemporary standards. What would you change? The sadistic skating dolls of Satan are glorious. I started shouting Hosanna's right away. Funny, campy, sexy, and visually stunning. Obviously French. Delisciously decadent. I hope it gets re-made soon. High camp as no other. Underated fun. Great chick film.

260158,4,6300216047,"Jane Fonda, dressed in unique fashion by Paco Rabanne, is the perfect choice for Barbarella, a 41st-century heroine in a psychedelic, sexually charged galaxy. Fonda is sexiest as ever, directed by the poignantly hot-minded Roger Vadim. The movie is not more (and not less) than a camp classic and the ideal film for all those who enjoy midnight movie sessions. The dialogue is often so nonsensical that results more hilarious than much comedies. The movie is not exactly good in terms of artistic quality, but it's a must-see. The pulpy characters and the colorful, poppy production design are absolutely unforgettable. Don't miss blind angel Pygar (hunky blonde John Philip Law)'s recurrent quote, when Anita Pallenberg disturbs him: ""An angel doesn't make love; an angel is love"". A treat.",977529600,10,791,5.1875
260159,4,6300216047,"Queen of cheese, fantastically beautiful and inviting, Jane Fonda keeps this camp classic at the top. Rocky, as in Horror Picture Show, even with its trendy, then and now?, bi-sexual, gender ambivilant, homosexual theme eventually becomes flaccid. Jane's sexuality holds, she's the girl males fantasized about when she made the movie, and barbarella still stirs the imagination.
First pubic hair display by a leading actress, at least a leading box office actress.
The movie is so utterly cheesey that it nicely puts Austin Powers in the boring and rather stupid than camp or cheesey category. My 21 year old son made that comment.
It's a lot of fun, so if you like cheese, a beautiful scantily clad woman, and an absurd story line, this one is definitely worth a look.",977356800,5,769,4.923076923076923

For the guys, there is Jane Fonda half naked for about 1/4th of the movie, and for the girls, she changes her outfit about 300 times (not to mention the cute blind angel).  Oh and here's an interesting tidbit for those of you who don't know, this movie is where the band Duran-Duran got there name.

260161,5,6300216047,"Most people who see this film have entirely missed the point. Many think this is a betrayal of the values of feminisim.. On the contrary... This film is a reaction to the sexist ""boy's club"" that was the space program in the 1960s. It was believed that females were incompatible with space missions because their sexuality would distract the men on board and screw up the quest for knowledge. This movie makes fun, to an extreme, of that ridiculous notion.  By using her sexuality overtly, Barbarella means not to objectify herself but to boldly thumb her nose at the sexism inherent in the space program (as well as many other industries) of the 1960s.
With that in mind it is both a hilarious and meaningful film, however silly it may be.",970790400,3,740,4.648854961832061

The picture  quality is amazing and sooo much better than the video I had. I was amazed  at the clarity of it, it was almost like watching a different movie (but,  come on now, can ""Barbarella"" really be mistaken for anything  else?).
You also get the classic trailer with this DVD. So it's very much  worth your time and money! Plus...along with Barbarella, you get the foxy  and vivacious Great Tyrant! Ooh! ;)",966038400,6,526,4.542553191489362
260163,4,6300216047,"Barbarella is an elegant Soft-Porn Sci-Fi Flick which consists of 4 sex scenes (dependant upon your definition of sex) interspersed with dressing,  undressing, and tearing off clothes. The alleged plot has only one True  Hero, Angel Pygar, who is otherwise a non-participant. For plot, there are  so-called heroes, apparently named after sex toys, revolting against  against a Lesbian Tyrant Queen. They mercifully perish. Pompous Vilain  Duran-Duran is so stuffy & pompous as to make him harmless, even if he  were to suceed, and despite his worst intententions. Director Vadim, then  Fonda's Husband is flagrantly showing her so as to say ""This is What I  keep in MY BED!.
However, despite being a mindles Sexploitive T&A  flick, This movie has REDEEMING QUALITIES if viewed on a deeper level, that  is, what Fonda & Vadim say through Barbarella about the Women's  Liberation Movement throught the four episodes of sex:
Sex Scene #1 -  Barbarella hitches a ride to town with the local Male Baby Sitter at the  cost of a Hot Sweaty Afternoon of Passion. The Iceboat goes Round &  Round to the tune of ""What's New Pussycat"". No vows of Celebacy  are being kept here! Loverboy is unsophisticated (doesn't know what the Sex  Pill is for), crude, but charming. Mutual Sexploitation nets Barbarella new  clothes and a ride to town. Barbarella lustfully rises/sinks to the task at  hand. Some would use the nasty word ""Prostitution"" to describe  what happened. Of course, these Ladies of the night are always criticized  for betraying the NOW cause. Worse/Better is to come!
Sex Scene #2 -  Barbarella cheers Pygar the Angel so he can fly again. In addition to the  issues of Sex Scene #1, we find that Pygar is of a different SPECIES, the  last of his kind. Some would use the ugly word ""Beastiality"" to  describe this. I am going to be generous and treat Barbarella as Female  Sexual Predator  who uses Sexploitation to take advantage of a man of  different RACE in a Moment of Weakness. Isn't the Women's Movement against  Sexploitation of anybody?
Sex Scene #3 - The Sex Pill. An attempt to be  kinky that mercifully fails. Instead, it is silly. It would be more  palatable, however, to the Women's Movement to use the Great Lesbian Tyrant  instead of that Stooge of a ""Good Guy"" Revolutionary.
Sex Scene  #4 - Death by Orgasm. Duran-Duran puts Barbarella into the Orgasmatron, the  Ultimate Sex Toy, to drive her beyond her tolerance level of Pleasure &  Shame, and to remove her clothes. Barbarella's Pleasure Tolerance is  off-scale, and her sense of shame is non-existant. When the ""Killer  Orgasm"" occurs, the machie overheats & shorts. Allegorically, does  this mean that Fonda & Vadim enjoys betraying the Women's Movement so  much and with so little Shame that they WANT Women's Lib to Short-Out? What  was Vadim thinking here? Any SELF-RESPECTING LIBERATED WIFE would have  BOBBITIZED him for that!
The Finale, Angel Pygar rescuing TWO LOVELY  LUMPS of Femininity, flying off into the Sunset with his GIRLS (Two Girls!)  is better than what any Male Chauvinist Pig Dare Dream! OINK! OINK!
In  view of the Fonda track record, and after this intensive reproductive  activity of Barbarella, a Pregnancy is practically eminent. The movie ends  before this is known; however , it brings up the issue of how Barbarella  would deal with it. In light of Fonda's exercise Video, I expect a betrayal  of the Pro-Choice Movement by opting for LaMaze over Abortion.
Viewed on  a deeper level of the Fonda-Vadim view of Women's Lib, this Shameless T  & A Flick gains stature as the Ultimate Betrayal of Women's Liberation,  raising it to the level of One of the Greatest Films of All Time!",965088000,4,3684,4.891410048622366
260164,4,6300216047,"I watched the movie in the cinema way back in 1968. I was mesmerized by Jane Fonda's portrayal of Barbarella. Although my friends didn't like it, I found it kind of nice. I don't remember the weightless strip tease but I  remember her appearing nude before the President of Earth. I remenber there  was some kind of conflict and her hiding, and later retrieving, a gun from  the groin of the blind angel. So when I read the reviews I decided I've got  to get the DVD to watch it again. When I did, I was once again mesmerized  by Jane Fonda. When Barbarella discovered how enjoyable the 'old' way of  making love was, she was eager and willing to make love with any man who  has helped or are going to help her. She even outlasted the machine that  supposed to kill by making love. I thing the tittle is a misnomer. It  should be ""Barbarella, Nymph of the Galaxy"". Considering it was  made way back in the 60's I thing it is quite remarkable!",952214400,5,942,4.301136363636363
260165,4,6300216047,"Okay, so these days Jane Fonda is weird, which is entirely understandable given that she is married to Ted Turner, who can often be found snoozing during Braves games, wearing a cap 3 sizes too big for his head.  But in  ""Barbarella,"" Jane Fonda is unbelievably hot, to the point where  I questioned whether this movie was real or a mere figment of my  fantastical imaginations.  Well, it's real, people, and you need to see it.  Not only is Jane utterly flawless (which can be easily seen by comparing  her to today's ""hot"" stars like Britney Speers, Jennifer Love  Hewitt, and Denise Richards), she also invites every male character in the  film to basically have his way with her.  Um, waiter, check please? But  seriously, we cannot be supporting this type of wanton behavior (primarily  for the reason that the women who act this way in the real world look more  like George Forman than Jane Fonda), so this type of vision is best left to  the campy comedy known as ""Barbarella."" I am 21, mind you, so I  am not biased towards the 60's, but I am telling you not to miss out on the  world's perfect female--watch it.",946339200,24,1120,4.525
