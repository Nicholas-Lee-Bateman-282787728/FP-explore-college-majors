8335110,1,B001Q7VSAW,"I wished it came with instructions stating that it would not play on American TV or DVDs. I sent one back thinking something was wrong with the set only to get another to have the same problem. I went to Circuit City and tried it in the new DVD to make sure my DVD wasn't the problem, I learned that it would only play on a laptop that required a software that was downloaded. Alot of time was wasted, I have been unable watch the hole thing. I got the book instead, from I saw it seem to be nice but cant honestly really tell you...",1354060800,3,533,4.037735849056604
8335111,4,B001Q7VSAW,"I did not realize that this video cannot be played on a portable DVD player. I would like to have viewed it while at work in my downtime since I don't have the time to sit through the entire 2 videos at home. The unabridged one was too long and drawn out as I viewed part of it. In the meantime I had already sent for the Thai stick for the massage, so when I returned the videos I bought the book. Never the less, as I study the book it's all a very interesting foot massage and I will use it in my massage work at the spa.",1353369600,,524,3.81651376146789

8335113,1,B001Q7VSAW,"The information on the DVD is very good, and the techniques being shown are good. However, this DVD does not work on American TVs. The only way I can play it is on my laptop and because it is not a commerically produces DVD the sound quality is fair.

Bottom line: It won't play on U.S. TVs and the sound quality is fair.",1352246400,2,321,4.095238095238095
