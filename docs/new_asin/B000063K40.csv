7959477,3,B000063K40,"The Retro Seduction Collector's Edition DVD plainly states (several times) that this film is the ""Uncut Feature Film"" with a running time of 96 Minutes (on the cover), the disc itself is 103 minutes; but even that running time is false. This version is the R-Rated print that played at drive ins and on pay cable. The sexual content was toned down. I have this on a DVD put out by another company (not E.I./Retro Seduction) and the original running time is 109 minutes with longer sex scenes. The cover also claims that it's ""restored from the 35 mm negative"" in it's original full frame (not pan & scan) aspect ratio release, but the film is pretty grainy, not what I'd call ""restored"".. I understand we're not talking about Casablanca or The Wizard of Oz, so I can forgive the quality, and the extras are actually nice (Audio Commentary with Producer Sam Sherman, TV Spots, Trailers, Rare Outtakes and a Deleted Scene; which is actually one of the edited sex scenes), but the blatant lie/claim about the film being ""UNCUT"" is very irresponsible. A scene cut and added to the extras doesn't in turn make it ""Uncut"".. So I am forced to keep both DVD's, due to false and deceptive advertising.

As far as the film goes, it's your usual cheap Independent International, Al Adamson early 70's Grindhouse sexploitation fare: The acting isn't award winning, the story is pretty dull and the film is way out of date... not to mention, the women aren't exactly models, and the old trolls in the sex scenes are pretty vile and hard to look at. But those who collect Grindhouse flicks know exactly why they want it; which is why I have a big problem with the ""UNCUT"" claim..",1388448000,4,1665,4.625
7959478,1,B000063K40,two 20 second topless scenes of a girl in bed and the actress isn't even one of the stewardesses. Not even worth free viewing,1357862400,,125,4.25
7959479,5,B000063K40,"This is what an adult flick is supposed to be: nice women (no tattooed, body-pierced skags); competent acting; enough silliness that you don't take it seriously, but enough plot that you want to follow the story.  The relationships seem more real than later flicks where moves and lines are wooden and strained.  Most of the movie was shot at various pleasant locations instead of the producer's basement 'studio' like some.  This isn't oscar material but doesn't pretend to be.  It's an hour-and-a-half of light entertainment that holds your interest.  I've paid more for less and so have you.  A bonus is the opening credits/soundtrack by ""SPARROW"".  I saw this movie when it first came out and that title song has stayed in my head for more than 30 years.  So has Connie Hoffman, the petite blonde lead actress.
