542723,5,6303014860,"In this 1st volume of This Is America, Charlie Brown: The Inventors, Sally gives her report on many of the different inventions in America, with Snoopy demonstrating each one (he gets Sally in trouble for his crazy antics!).  Then Linus gives his report on Alexander Graham Bell (it's fun watching Linus go back in time and watch Mr. Bell's telephone invention take off).  Peppermint Patty and Marcie give a report on Thomas Edison, inventor of the phonograph and the electric lightbulb (Peppermint Patty also goes back in time and pays Mr. Edison a visit).  Finally, Charlie Brown gives a report on the invention of the automobile (then called the horseless carriage; see Snoopy and Lucy race against each other) and Henry Ford's improvements.  David Benoit, who would later release Here's to You, Charlie Brown, composes the music.",1016928000,5,833,5.0583941605839415
542724,4,6303014860,"In Volume 3 of This is America, Charlie Brown, Charlie Brown gives his report on the Transcontinental Railroad.  The Civil War has just ended and 2 competing railroads, The Union Pacific and the Central Pacific race to connect the Transcontinental Railroad from coast to coast.  Both sides endure cold winters and hot summers.  Meanwhile, in one of the towns where spikes and rails are being laid down (with some help from Charlie Brown, Linus, Snoopy and many Chinese immigrants), Spike tries out as a harmonica player at a local saloon with Schroeder as the piano player. Finally, in 1869, the 2 railroads meet.  The soundtrack features the Winans singing lively renditions of folk songs like ""This Train is Bound for Glory"", ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic"", ""I've Been Working On the Railroad"" and ""Get on Board, Little Children"".",1016236800,,835,4.985611510791367
542725,4,6303014860,"I'll be reviewing all 8 videos of This Is America, Charlie Brown individually. I thought I'd start with The Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk (Volume 2).
This video starts with the history of flying starting with the legends of Icarus leading up to the Wright Brothers in the late 19th century. Charlie Brown and Linus are invited to visit Linus' cousin Dolly. Together, they witness the Wright Brothers' 1st flight. It's a fast bumpy trip with Snoopy as the coachbeagle! Charlie Brown tries flying the Wright Brothers' kite and it flies him instead! Meanwhile, Snoopy and Woodstock try out some flying experiments of their own! This video is both informative and fun and includes a cool ragtime jazz score by Wynton Marsalis (who would later release Joe Cool Blues).",1012003200,2,763,4.922480620155039
542726,4,6303014860,"I found this video to be great addition to my son's growing collection. The accuracy and level of detail regarding space life and travel was deftly interwoven with the peanut gang personae - thus providing a delightful mix of entertainment and learning in one. I was, however, somewhat dismayed with the invasion of adults in this film. The ground crew are all grown-ups; parts which could easily have been filled by the remaining peanuts characters. The events are monitored by some Walter Cronkite wannabe newscaster in a role tailor made for Marcie(much like her part as reporter in 'You're a Good Sport, C.B.). That aside, this half-hour special remains pleasant and fun viewing for kids. Classic? No, but extremely competent.",983318400,4,730,5.091666666666667

They are called ""Mayflower Voyagers"" and not ""Pilgrims"" to reflect the diversity of the settlers. This is a great little video for children to grasp the essential elements of this time in history.",1509840000,,314,5.3

542791,5,6303014860,"The Great Inventors is one of several videos from the This Is America, Charlie Brown series.  This series of videos portrays key events in American history with the use of the characters of the Peanuts comic strip.  This video is a good introduction to three of the most important inventions in history:  the telephone, the light bulb, and the automobile.  The opening segment considers other important inventions in history such as basketball and football.  The video then transitions to an informative and succinct depiction of Alexander Graham Bell and the telephone, Thomas Edison and the light bulb, and Henry Ford and the automobile (which was developed almost concurrently in Europe).  At about 25 minutes in length this is a concise, informative, and entertaining video about great inventors and their inventions.  Though designed for an elementary school audience I have shown this video to my middle school students and have found it to be an effective teaching tool.",1475280000,,977,5.1847133757961785
542792,5,6303014860,"Charlie Brown is making history fun and memorable in these brief presentations. I had the VHS tapes when my kids were young and was so thrilled to see them now out on DVD.

542837,5,6303014860,"It was interesting learning about the Central Pacific and the Northern Conneticut Railroads. It was entertaining when they added the Peanuts characters into the movie. It was depressing that the Chinese were left out of the photo of the last day when they drove in the golden

First off, do not buy this from sellers who are trying to rip you off at a set price of $45 USED and $200 NEW.  Are you serious?  I purchase this from Newberry Comics through Amazon Market place and paid $20 for a legit R1 DVD.  This collection of Peanuts shorts on American History is wonderful.  I remember when they first aired on television in the late 80's.  The information that Charlie Brown and the gang provide is great and they explain everything on a level anyone can understand.  There are some in-jokes sprinkled throughout each episode that the adults will find entertaining.  If you love History and Peanuts this is a must buy.  Just don't give your hard earned dollars to people who want to rip you off.",1264377600,4,789,4.5

542842,1,6303014860,"As a grandma, I preview videos for my young grandchildren.  The 24 minute video, #8 offering in the ""This is America, Charlie Brown"" group is NOT a good one!

The first part of the video was just fine.  It is the last part I take to task!  Remember, this is just a 24 minute video, folks.  The presentation of the more recent years of our country's history was not appropriate for especially young viewers!  The strong emphasis on pictures of war was unnessary.  There is more to our country than war!  Since in 24 minutes they cannot present ALL the events in our country's history, to present the pictures of the anti Viet Nam protests, injured soldiers, a plane strafing bombs was taking advantage of our young viewers who love Charlie Brown and the gang and presenting heavy adult historical involvement.  This was TOTALLY inappropriate! Whoever wrote the script for this video had an agenda!  I think Charles Schulz would turn over in his grave if he thought his Charlie Brown gang exposed children to undesirable thinking in the name of entertainment! This was written by Lee Mendelson and Bill Melendez, I believe, NOT Charles Schulz!

The other videos in the group present a more acceptable presentation of our history, Even though the civil war was presented, the tie to President Lincoln made that war presentation acceptable.  Also, the Civil War is at a distance now.

I would urge all parents or grandparents to preview this volume #8 before any showing to young people.  I will use my copy to do just that.  Otherwise, I would just destroy the copy I have!",1183420800,3,1570,4.720588235294118
542843,5,6303014860,"Once again Charles Schultz's lovable charachters manage to bring entertainment in a successful combination with education to children.  As the Christmas special and Thanksgiving special take moments to recognize the history of these holidays, this series of videos brings America's history to young viewers.  In the Great inventors, Alexander Graham Bell's discovery of the telephone is pure entertainment.  I found myself learning along with my kids.  I think this series is an outstanding attempt to introduce American history to even the youngest viewer.  While there are some moments that the stories are probably lost on the young viewer, kids are introduced to the langauge of our history that may help them remember these events when learning about them in school.  I recommend this series to any parent who is looking for a way to introduce these concepts and events to his or her children.",1025654400,9,898,5.201388888888889
542844,5,6303014860,"Volume 8 (The Music and Heroes of America) is another one of my favorite volumes to This Is America, Charlie Brown.
As it begins, Schroeder is reluctant to let Snoopy participate for his report on music in America.  So Charlie Brown proposes that if Snoopy behave himself, he be allowed.  Both agree and the band features Snoopy on banjo, Franklin on drums, Pig Pen on bass, Charlie Brown on harmonica and trumpet, Linus on guitar and trombone and Schroeder on piano (what else?).  The gang plays ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"", ""Yankee Doodle"", and ""Oh When the Saints Go Marching In"",pays homage to John Phillips Sousa with ""Stars and Stripes Forever"", Irving Berlin, George Cohan with ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"", and Scott Joplin with ""Maple Leaf Rag"".
Then Lucy announces that she'd like to combine her report on heroes of America with Schroeder's (naturally, he's furious but the teacher agrees!).  She pays homage to Susan B Anthony, Clara Barton, and Helen Keller (even dares to put a Susan B Anthony bust atop Schroeder's piano!).  Other heroes mentioned include Eissenhower, Martin Luther King, and Jonas Salk.  Peppermint Patty talks about immigration and pay homage to Irving Berlin.  There's even mention of Vietnam (""Where Have All the Flowers Gone"").  Snoopy dresses up as Franklin D Roosevelt and Elvis.
Franklin gives a report on African American History (paying homage to George Washington Carver and Booker T Washington) and talks about spirituals (""Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen""), and the formation of gospel, ragtime, blues and jazz.
As this episode ends, Charlie Brown is asked what his favorite song is (watch for yourself to find out!).  Ed Bogas, Desiree Goyette, and Lou Rawls all contribute to the musical score of this final volume of This Is America, Charlie Brown.",1018656000,19,1790,5.102739726027397
542845,5,6303014860,"The NASA Space Station (Volume 5 of This Is America, Charlie Brown) is one of my favorites of the 8 volumes!
It all starts out with Linus building a replica of a space station (will he win?).  That night, he dreams that he and the Peanuts gang are part of a crew travelling in space for 90 days.  Lucy is Space Commander (""One small step to becoming a queen!""), Snoopy is the space station operator, Linus is the crew's scientist, Peppermint Patty is in charge of exercise (her exercise plan is similar to one of a drill seargant's!), and Charlie Brown is in charge of cooking and photography (he has a hard time keeping his culinary experiments on the ground!).  Pig Pen demonstrates how a shower is taken in outer space, but of course, doesn't stay clean for long!  Woodstock demonstrates flight in zero gravity but isn't too successful in his own power!  Lucy has an experiment of her own- having Charlie Brown kick the football on national television.  Can he do it in zero gravity?  Suddenly the spaceship hits a meteorite and so it's Charlie Brown and Snoopy to the rescue!  Can they fix the damaged panel?
This volume features a delightful musical score from jazz legend Dave Brubeck (known for ""Take Five"").  This video also predicts: ""America's next Space Station will be launched in the mid 1990's"" (remember, this was originally aired in 1988).",1018656000,10,1355,4.7076271186440675
542846,4,6303014860,"The 1st part of this 7th volume of This Is America, Charlie Brown features the Peanuts gang at the many museums of the Smithsonian Institution.  Snoopy gets upset when he see the Red Baron's airplane, Charlie Brown is flattered to see a lunar space module named after himself and Snoopy, Sally wonders if the paintings displayed were ""paint by numbers"" paintings, Lucy spots a cartoon of herself pulling that football away from you-know-who (""How did we wind up there?"", she wonders), and Linus witnesses a big mouth and dares to tell Lucy ""We finally found something with a mouth bigger than yours!""
The 2nd part of this video talks about the Presidents.  Charlie Brown and Linus go back to 1865 and visit Abraham Lincoln as he's on his way to Gettysburg, PA.  Linclon discusses the Civil War and a speech he's currently getting ready to give (known as the Gettysburg Address, of course!).  Then the gang goes to 1901 in Yosemite National Park to hear Theodore Roosevelt talk about his plans to conserve wildlife.  Finally, they go to the 1930's and witness the Great Depression.  Franklin D. Roosevelt is inaugurated and promises aid to those out of work.  Dave Grusin provides this video's soundtrack, and selections of it are featured on the CD Happy Anniverdsary, Charlie Brown.",1018137600,16,1283,4.88479262672811
