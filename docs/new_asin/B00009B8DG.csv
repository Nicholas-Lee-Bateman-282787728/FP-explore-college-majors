7990512,1,B00009B8DG,"To sum everything up at the start, I didn't find a single redeeming element in this particular series. The characters were all goofy and I didn't find myself liking any of them. The animation was weak and the art style B-grade anime fare. The storyline was also weak and goofy, and after three-quarters of the show it still didn't redeem itself. I still didn't care what was happening or what was going to happen.

Now, I haven't watched the OVAs where this rehash was supposedly based on. Maybe I should, because I've heard and read from reviews that it is better. I'm not picky when it comes to anime, but even I couldn't get into this one. Be warned.",1225756800,,653,4.487394957983193
7990513,5,B00009B8DG,This is the best of the El Hazard series in my opinion. Just give them a shot. I own the full VHS set. Very funny. ^^,1196985600,2,117,3.5384615384615383
7990514,4,B00009B8DG,"I have watched all 3 box set series of el Hazard in both English and Japanese.  They all have very good story lines.  Now the OVA's are not the same as the TV series but are very simular to the other two boxed sets.

I highly recommend this anime if you like Arabian knights type story line.  Since this is what it is modeled after.

People who just watch the OVA's and don't keep an open mind should not rate and anime series.",1188950400,3,427,4.096385542168675
7990515,1,B00009B8DG,"I watched the original OVAs and loved them, so I thought a TV series would be

cool. This however, was not the case. The things that made the OVAs so magical were removed, and what I saw of it was a rehash. If you haven't seen the OVAs, you might like the TV series.",1170288000,,266,3.925925925925926
