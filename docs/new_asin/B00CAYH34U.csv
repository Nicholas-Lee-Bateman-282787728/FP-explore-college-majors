8579370,1,B00CAYH34U,"We bought this as a tease gift for a bridal party. Now I feel bad.  It's really trashy. Some things should remain private. This felt simply cheap.

The trilogy was a good read because it had so much wit and banter between those in the story.
This on the other hand should not be named after or linked to the series. It was not tastefully done and it should stand alone. In my opinion...",1425081600,,386,4.202702702702703
8579371,5,B00CAYH34U,"This can be a bit much for some people. It's real life stories about women into BDSM. It's not as ""vanilla"" as the book so it could be disturbing to some but it is very interesting. These women let you into their world and l now look at them in a different light. No judgment from me.",1424304000,,284,4.0

8579373,5,B00CAYH34U,"Very informative film of the BDSM lifestyle. I like that it is told by real women and men and not actors. It makes it more interesting to me to watch. I recommend this film to anyone who has read the ""Fifty Shades"" books or to anyone who is just curious. It's about more than just handcuffs.",1379376000,11,291,4.214285714285714
8579374,5,B00CAYH34U,"This film offers insight into the real world of BDSM from those who live it. I was aware of the cultural impact of 50 shades, but had no idea how real and structured the BDSM community is. I went in thinking they were weird, but after watching I felt they were the sane ones. A great doc!",1377820800,8,288,4.0701754385964914
