2182095,5,B0006D3HEC,"We have read these books for a couple of years now and son loves them. So when we were looking for a new dvd for him. I thought lets try this. He absolutely loves this the Berenstain bears mind there manners dvd. Can't wait to get others.  While it's not exactly like the books, of course they had to change it slightly for the movies. It is very close to the books. They do have messages in there stories so the kids get a sense of what is right and wrong. I would recommend these to everyone. These are great for boys or girls.",1215302400,3,529,4.086538461538462

Great edutainment and a good reminder for parents to set the example and use their manners too! Also, it was great when my daughter wanted a toy and I reminded her about the ""Gimmies"" and she was quiet after that!!",1185062400,12,350,4.4

8041178,5,B0006D3HEC,My 3 year old grand daughter enjoys Berenstein Bears books so the videos are a treat. The segments are short enough to hold attention and the subject matter is relevant. The lessons in the plots are valid without being preachy.,1388620800,,227,4.7
8041179,5,B0006D3HEC,The DVD's arrived on time and in great shape. The stories are teaching my students while entertaining them. I am using the programs with my behavior disordered students and I am enjoying watching my student remember the lessons and discussing what happened and/or what should have been done differently.  Berenstain Bears are WONDERFUL lesson starters. Thank You!,1364947200,,363,5.368421052631579

8041182,5,B0006D3HEC,You can't go wrong purchasing a Berenstain Bears video!  The videos teach children how they should and shouldn't act!  So many shows these days are full of adult humor or sarcasm (which young children do not understand).  I HIGHLY recommend this video and all the Berenstain Bear videos!!,1315267200,2,288,4.958333333333333
