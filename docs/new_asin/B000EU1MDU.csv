8114457,4,B000EU1MDU,"This movie really wasn't bad for a TV movie.  Watched it because I'm a Jamie Luner fan.  It builds pretty slowly, especially since the summary already tells you that Jamie's character fakes her own death.  The movie spends a lot of time trying to build suspense to the caving accident, but since you already know she's going to survive, it kind of falls flat.  Once we move on to her new life, the story picks up and the acting seems to get better, too.  Plus, we never have to see that awful wig Jamie's wearing in the cover image again, which is a major bonus.",1467504000,,562,4.314285714285714

8114461,5,B000EU1MDU,"I watched this on tv one time and it was great, chick was in a bad marriage with an abusive husband, only her boss/friend knows about it and she talks her out of it. While on a trip to a nearby cave the wife fakes her own death and escapes. The husband believes his wife is dead until he finds a clue and hires a PI to find her. The PI finds the wife in a small town with a new identity and a new boyfriend, he tells the husband and he's not happy about that, the husband kills the PI and goes after his wife and her boyfriend. He tortures them both but they escape and the movie ends happily. I so recommend this to any lifetime fan.",1412812800,,634,3.9224806201550386
