8756192,4,B01DKTCAVY,"Robert Taylor {RT}  by 1938 had reached a near superstar status having finished in the box office polls #  6 in 1936 , # 3  in 1937 and would wind up at # 7  in 1938 and this movie showcases him perfectly. This film was also  part of a concerted effort by MGM to steer away from his ""pretty boy"" image and  to project a more masculine personana with this flick,  The Crowd Roars"" {1938}  and ""Stand Up and Fight"" {1939} - see my  10/26/15 review.

RT {Lee Sheridan} plays a swell- headed small town boy who is the local  star athlete and by some  unlikely circumstances winds up with a  scholarship to Oxford with a big sendoff by the town which  only stokes his conceit gene even more. The traditional, class ridden Oxford student body  is quickly alienated by his brashness and less than reverant attitude towards their mores so despite his athletic prowess he  becomes a combination of being a joke and despised at the same time. Two romantic subplots with an implied infidelity involving dark haired British beauties Maureen O'Sullivan and Vivian Leigh add some spice to the plotline of  keen sportsmanship, ""keeping a stiff upper lip"" and ""taking one for the team"" which {after some hard knocks and truths} Sheridan is prepared to do and face explusion - just before the big Oxford / Cambridge boat race.

 A sterling supporting cast including Lionel Barrymore  {Lee's wise dad}, Edward Gwen {as an benign Oxford dean } and very British students Paul Beaumont, Edward Rigby and Robert Coote  all give  solid support  to RT who is excellent as the {initally} ""ugly American who {with Dad's assistance}  would eventually more than  show all of  Oxford that he  could adapt, learn and grow as a team-mate and as a man.

The film was mostly filmed in England / Oxford and Oxford's buildings, classrooms , halls and playing fields very effectively add to the  movies  feel and tone. Veteran MGM house director Jack Conway moves the film along smartly and while this flick isn't a classic  - it is a solidly acted and entertaining effort that I give a 4 star rating - Recommened.",1463529600,5,2078,4.641873278236915
8756193,5,B01DKTCAVY,"I am rating the  movie and not the DVD, which I haven't seen yet. Since there is no synopsis here's mine. Lee Sheridan (Robert Taylor) is a sports hero at his small town college and earns a scholarship to Oxford. His father (Lionel Barrymore) a newspaper publisher has touted his sporting accomplishments in his paper and given him a huge ego. He's a brash American and instantly puts the Oxford community off. His attitude and American sensibilities means more to his staid Oxford classmates than his sporting accomplishments. His rough treatment by three Oxford classmates (led by Paul Beaumont, played by Griffith Jones) makes him reconsider staying. He does decide to stay, partly to impress Molly Beaumont, played by Maureen O'Sullivan. He does finally comes to be accepted when he joins the rowing team and helps them beat rival Cambridge in an annual boat race. This movie was remade in 1984 with Rob Lowe and Ally Sheedy called Oxford Blues.",1462579200,2,949,4.93125
