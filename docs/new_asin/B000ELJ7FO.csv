2522319,1,B000ELJ7FO,I wish i hadn't wasted my money.  The acting was terrible and the story line was extremely corny.,1199318400,2,97,4.388888888888889
2522320,1,B000ELJ7FO,"Three days ago I received a box full of really stupid movies entitled ""Serial Psychos"". I watched each movie as best I could. I admit there was some fast forwarding involved. I then carefully put each DVD back in the box and walked over to the garbage can and placed the box into the garbage can along with the chinese food that I couldn't finish last night. I had asked for no MSG but because of the language barrier the food was not to my specifications and wound up in the garbage just underneath ""Serial Psychos"".",1158796800,8,517,4.395833333333333
2522321,5,B000ELJ7FO,"Finally I buy I DVD and I don't feel like I've been ripped off. All of the movies are really bloody, twisted and sick! After watching all six movies one night I seriously considered quiting my job and becoming a serial killer. I loved I Hate You, Blood Massacre, Thirteen and Las Vegas Blood Bath. All of the movies are entertaining and Serial Psycho's is a great buy!  You can't loose on this one.",1140566400,9,398,4.378378378378378
8111052,4,B000ELJ7FO,"I ordered the dvd and received it within a few days. Very fast. The dvd has a collection of what I would consider B movies, which is great if you really love this genre. I have watched about half already and looking forward to watching the rest.",1467417600,,245,4.23404255319149
8111053,1,B000ELJ7FO,"Okay, you have to take these movies for what they are. I knew when purchasing them, (6 movies at this price) that the movies were not going to be the top of the line, cinema shown movies. But I got them for a different reason. Me and my friends wanted a good old fashion scare the crap out of you set of flicks for a bonfire and outside get together we were planning for a weekend. We knew that some of the material in the movies would be laudable, but I can't fault the seller for what I knew I was buying. It's obvious from the cover and the price that this is what we were getting. These movies are pretty bad...but then I knew that when I bought them. They are pretty gory, but I knew that when I bought them. The acting is pretty bad, but I knew that when I bought them. Sometimes the story lines don't fit the titles, so I wonder if they just pulled them out of the air? You can sit through some, some you have to hit the fast forward button A LOT. I guess I'd say of the six videos Slasher would be the best of the worst, and lets just say they are pretty bad. Just remember when buying these you are not buying cinema quality movies, and this is often the case with horror movies. These would be B quality movies or C if they had them. The seller was very courteous and I received the video quickly and well packaged. Everything was in tact, so therefore I gave it three stars. I have no complaints or issues and the product I've tried worked. I am very pleased I was given the opportunity to try this product. I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. The discount I received will not alter my honest and true opinion in any way. Since I count on honest product reviews to make my selections on Amazon, I will always be forthcoming and truthful in all my reviews.",1460419200,,1811,4.162393162393163
8111054,3,B000ELJ7FO,"The item arrived on time and packaged well. So no issues with that. But now on to the movies.

Boy oh boy where to begin. These are great if you are a lover of not quite B films. We got so wrapped up at how bad the acting, how thin the plots were, as well as the alleged cinematography that we forgot that these films were supposed to be scary. No so much as a decent jump scare to be found in any of these movies but they are all entertaining just the same.  We especially enjoyed Thirteen it was campy, with just the right mix of halting speech from the actors, transparent and smattered with enough pointless sex scenes to be hilarious and we also found that the speech is so halting in most of these if you play it at 1.5 speed it almost sounds normal.

But all in all, these are good for many laughs with a group of like minded friends but not even remotely scary and most of them look like they are from the 80s and/or filmed on a cell phone.

I received this item at a discount or free for my honest review.",1457654400,,1014,4.055
8111055,3,B000ELJ7FO,I have watched this dvd and it's not my cup of tea.it is more of the old style of movies. more like something you would see at a film festable. lots of gore and blood. film quality is poor at best. the rating on it is right on it is not suited for younger viewers. it will be great watch for the diehard blood and gore fan. I received this movie for shipping cost of 3.99 witch is about all I would pay to buy it. BUT THEY ARE FANS OUT THERE THAT WILL LOVE IT. I have several mill creek dvds that I just love this is not one of them. delivery was fast and on time.,1457395200,,564,3.788135593220339
8111056,3,B000ELJ7FO,"When I got this set of movies I was very excited to sit down and watch some corny horror movies, But sadly these aren't horror movies, they look more like home videos with crappy editing, I watched one called ""Slasher"" First and the video was so bad I couldn't hardly tell what was going on. I lost interest but kept the movie playing and tuning in every so often. Then next I watched ""Las Vegas Blood Bath"" The video on this one was better than the previous one but this one had way more gore and boobies. That was okay but after a while it seemed to just be all about the boobs. Then the movie got nasty. I ever watched the other ones, I might one day and then I will update this review, But until then I will give this 3 stars and I would not reccomend this to anyfriends, It isn't worth the selling price.

8111057,2,B000ELJ7FO,I hate to be the negative person here as I am open minded and tried to watch the 6 titles but they got the best of me. The quality was the worst I have ever seen as well as having the appearance of being shot on and mm film projector. The quality is very bad. I know that the actors are trying but they seem to be as low budget as you can get. I think people in our neighborhood could do better than this. I hate to complain as I received this dvd as a promotion and in exchange for my honest opinion. The opinion I have is 3 thumbs down. I hope I never see movies as bad as this again. I will have nightmares not about the film but about how bad it is.,1457049600,,653,3.7737226277372264

8111059,4,B000ELJ7FO,"""Las Vegas Blood Bath"" is pretty hilarious, but the real winner here is ""Blood Massacre"".  Marvel in awe at Don Dohler gone sleazy in this ridiculously awesome horror romp.  Really twisty turny with tons of left field surprises and bizarre behavior on display.  Get Dohlerized today!",1388793600,2,283,5.108695652173913
8111060,3,B000ELJ7FO,"Blood Massacre is the gorefest from the late great Don Dohler that I've been waiting to see. George Stover as a foul-mouthed psychopath? Cannibals? Late 80s gore sickness? Oh yeah, baby!",1365292800,3,186,5.032258064516129
8111061,2,B000ELJ7FO,"I found this 6 movie collection for a mere $2.89, and still had to read some other people's reviews to get an idea of how bad these movies were gonna be, before buying it.  ""Pure crap,"" was the consensus.  But ya know how your tongue keeps checking out your sore tooth or that place where you bit the inside of your cheek, even though it hurts, a lot?  Well, my eyes just had to see these nasty films.  Inexplicably, I craved the experience I knew would be an unpleasant chore.  And after all, $2.98 for 6 movies is a serious bargain.  I guess I love a bargain better than I do a good movie.  So, I bought it and I watched it, all of it.

Whoever first wrote that ""Plan 9..."" was the worst film ever, spoke too soon, and clearly never saw any of these masterpieces of the talentlessness.  Still, I try to find what's good about a film, while enduring all that sucks about it.  So here's the good and bad of each film. By the way, I have a pet peeve about movie titles that don't fit the film.

""Blood Massacre"" Reasonably appropriate title.  A good idea, poorly executed.  Four crooks take a family hostage, who turn out to be homicidal cannibals.  Bad script, lousy storytelling and horrible acting, although there is some characterization.  Once the gore begins however, the movie gets fun.  If you expect great gore, you're not too bright.  Nothing about this, or any of the films in this collection is great, or even good.  Finally, if it hasn't already been done, this basic story could make an excellent ""B"" horror film.

""Thirteen""  The title derives from the fact that the letter ""M,"" that's carved into each victim's torso, is the thirteenth letter of the alphabet - that's all - no other significance.  Someone is killing queers and others with AIDS, and a radio talk show host talks about it every night.  The script had potential, but insufficient cash to be a contender.  This movie's fatal flaw is that the director failed to recognize this and took the project way too seriously, instead having fun, making a tongue in cheek spoof of serious serial killer movies.  The gore is OK.

""Hip Hop Locos""  Cool, meaningless title.  The idea here, is that a gang, on a killing and robbing spree, film their exploits.  I imagined it might be kind of ""The Barrio Witch Project.""  However, in the first 10 minutes, there were so many unnecessary effects and filters in use, that any matter-of-fact documentation effect was lost, and I turned it off.  Someone was having fun with their new video camera and effects programs.  They never shoulda downloaded it.

""Las Vegas Blood Bath""  Good title.  Ever seen one of those lousy, very low budget porn films from the eighties, where a lame premise with just enough of a story to require the talent less ""actors"" to talk between the sex scenes?  Remember the fried hair and the disappointing sex?  Switch the sex with ridiculous gore and that sums up this movie.  But just like ""bad sex is better than no sex,"" ""bad gore is better than no gore.""  Still, I was using the fast forward button a lot, by this time.

""I Hate You""  The title comes from something in the film, but doesn't really apply to the story that unfolds.  A failed, elderly comic decides that his only hope for fame, at this point in his life, is to become a serial killer.  Not a bad story idea.  Probably part of some stand up comic's routine, but the script, directing and acting do it no justice.  Violent, but not really gory.

""Slasher""  The title is somewhat inaccurate and deceiving, although there's plenty of slashing, cutting and chopping.  You might even notice some dicing and a little mincing, too.  This is the only film in which there is any real acting.  Even though it's all amateur, I still really appreciated it, after all the awful untrained attempts in the 5 previous movies.  A town sheriff, investigating a series of brutal murders with an occult connection, doubts his sanity, as he uncovers a shocking truth.  Ya know, he's just about the only one in town not in on it.  This one sucks too, but has more decent moments than the rest.  And some of the gore is pleasantly gruesome, too.

I don't know where, if anywhere, these films might have been shown before.  If any had been shown to paying customers, I'm sure I would have heard about the riot that ensued, as customers demanded refunds.  Direct to video?  Maybe.  Personally, I've never seen anything as bad as these, not even on Elvira's show.  But if you have any interest in seeing how bad, bad can actually be, check it out.  I have a feeling there are worse movies than these, but after watching any one of these films, you will have a new and greater perspective from which to judge all other films you will see, like it or not.  Consider it a priceless education for just $3.  A serious bargain.

I give it 2 stars for the invaluable experience.",1286064000,6,4849,4.534104046242774
