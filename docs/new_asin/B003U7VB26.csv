8405694,5,B003U7VB26,"A helicopter ride through the Rhine Valley with commentary on what you are seeing and strange choices of music. My great grandparents emigrated from St. Goar which is why I bought this. I was pleasantly surprised that, although it is a DVD, it translated well onto a large screen when played on a blu-ray player. When this starts out, the areas pretty much look like any river/ manufacturing area anywhere. But as you get down into the more mountainous region of the Rhine, the music becomes classical and the tree covered areas and the castles make for a great ride. I would have liked it if they had just covered this beautiful area and devoted more time to it. But it is a DVD that I can leave for my children so they can see where their great-great grandparents lived and wonder why they ever left.",1394841600,,802,4.5
