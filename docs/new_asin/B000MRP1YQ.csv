2745237,5,B000MRP1YQ,"I have seen this produced in several opera houses and I reviewed several DVDs for a presentation I was making.  While I have always found the music magnificent, I have never found the opera involving.  Until this production.  The Kabuki setting for all but the peasants is so inspired and seems so perfect for this particular opera, one can only wonder why it hasn't been done this way before.  Strauss and Hoffmanstahl created a very nonbelievable libretto and it really takes a production that brings the characters into a nonbelievable but ultimately involving universe to bring the opera fully alive.  The singing is first rate, the acting superb, and Titus will knock your socks off as the ever forgiving Barak.  You even get a glimpse of the feminist sentiments of the Dyer's Wife in the presentation by Janis Martin, who would in actuality like to have an identity of her own.

I very much liked the cinematography on this.  Many cinematography directors seem to focus primarily on closeups, disregarding the full stage and reactions of other characters. I prefer seeing more of the stage and seeing the full gamut of emotions expressed by the characters on stage.  I enjoy seeing the body language of the singers.  The balance in this DVD struck me as quite good.  I was never taken away from my interest in the opera by having to wonder what I was missing while the focus was on the eyes and nose of the singer!

I will say that I presented this to a group of retired people studying Strauss operas, extremely pleased with myself that I had found an unsurpassable production of Die Frau and was greeted with horror by many participants.  One gal - who claims to be very knowledgeable in opera, having worked in the business - sympathized with me that this was the only DVD I could find.  Thus, I would caution that the production is not for traditionalists!",1268006400,3,1866,4.701538461538462
2745238,4,B000MRP1YQ,"""Die Frau"" and I have been together since college. I was lucky enough to see the old Met 1966 production several times, and I think Strauss would have loved it. And as I do, he would have hated the new Met production. This Swallisch DVD was incredible. I also own the Solti. I agree with one reviewer in that I DON'T like the cuts that Swallisch makes, especially in the ACT 3 finale. But the singing, the orchestra and the evocative sets and staging more than make up for this. The staging on the Solti DVD is downright dull. In particular, I went nuts over the Swallisch Act II finale, all created on stage by unduating, flowing drapery; by the way, in the new Met Opera production, nothing happens at the end of Act II. The most amazing thing though is that even I supppose this DVD is NOT HD, when I played it on my blu-ray, it seemed like HD, especially in all the close-ups! Amazing! I really wish someone had been able to make a video recording of that incredible 1966 Met ""Frau,"" because it will never be seen again (right up there with the recently retired Met ""Ring""). I would recommend this ""Frau"" DVD over the Solti which just doesn't do this great opera justice, despite the fact that Solti was a great conductor.",1246060800,5,1226,4.405286343612334
2745239,4,B000MRP1YQ,"This is what a good ""Frau"" should look like.  The Asian costumes and make-up (by a Japanese team) are brilliant.  The stage effects are diverting.  But the opera is heavily cut (the standard Karl Boehm edition). If you want uncut, go with the Solti-Studer-Marton version.  All three ladies here have trouble with their high notes. but those costumes are just so interesting that you often don't care.  You can usually tell how far-out things will be from the costume worn early on by the Spirit Messenger, and he does not disappoint with his bizarre outfit.

This performance ends the way too many opera DVDs end: group bows but no solo bows for the singers.  The conductor (Sawallisch) gets a solo bow, and then the director gets a solo bow, and the audience gives him a huge ovation for this gorgeous opulent production.  I wish I could have been there with them to cheer him.

""Frau"" is my favorite German opera, so I want it uncut.  And I want a soprano with a glorious soaring life-of-its-own top (I saw Rysanek do this live... with Nilsson). Luana DeVol is not in the Rysanek Big Leagues, but then who is? I want the Dyer's Wife to make loud Elektra noises, and Janis Martin does it here.  Strauss was never kind to his tenors, but Peter Seiffert survives the arduous task of his two solo scenes. Alan Titus is Barak, and he does justice to those soft slow gorgeous melodies.  Marjana Lipovsek is the Nurse, but she's much better on the Solti DVD, where she gets to sing all of her extra music that is cut here.",1195776000,8,1517,4.516483516483516
2745240,5,B000MRP1YQ,"Not only the most visually captivating performance of any opera I've ever seen, but aurally gratifying beyond measure - up there with the early Karajan VPO recording.",1192147200,4,166,5.185185185185185
2745241,5,B000MRP1YQ,"This is an extraordinary DVD of Strauss' masterpiece Die Frau Ohne Schatten. The asian setting and costumes are a little strange at first, but after you get acquainted with them you will enjoy this disc. But this music alone is worth the price of the film. The score is cut slightly (I hate when they do that!!) but Sawallisch knows the score like the back of his hand and it shows. The singers are good, especially Luana DeVol, though nowhere in the league as Varady in Solti's definitive recording. Run and secure a copy.....quick!, before they're all gone. You'll be glad you did. Bravo Bayerische Staarsoper.",1190332800,7,612,4.783018867924528
2745242,1,B000MRP1YQ,"It's no match either for Sawallisch's own legendary audio recording for EMI. The Solti on video from Salzburg and the Sawallisch from Munich on compact disc are the ones to beat. Both conductors were fortunate to have superior (and still unbeatable) casts (the best Kaiserin since Rysanek [Studer], Marton, et al) at the time their interpretations were captured for posterity. This Sawallisch video from Japan simply falls short vocally and dramatically.",1190160000,6,454,5.408450704225352
2745243,5,B000MRP1YQ,"""Die Frau ohne Schatten"" is a challenging opera to perform and this production is remarkable for the impressive singing and the staging, which helps to make what is muddled comprehensible. While Act I remains coherent, the storyline then gets bogged down and becomes confused, difficult even for a sympathetic viewer to follow. Of course, Strauss' gorgeous music soars above the obscurities of the plot or intended meanings.

The kabuki costumes, headdresses and mask-like faces of the emperor, empress and nurse make them appropriately mysterious and otherworldly and separate them from the human world of Barak and his wife. The empress and the dyer's wife not only sing well but also act well and make their characters believable.

The moment with the greatest dramatic impact for me is the ""conversation"" in Act I between the nurse, the empress and the falcon. The sparse kabuki-style staging is very effective here. If you enjoy Strauss' music and can allow yourself to go along with the invented moralizing fairy tale, you will enjoy this production and images like this scene may stay in your mind for a long time afterward.",1186099200,7,1131,5.075268817204301
2745244,5,B000MRP1YQ,"Like a ""Frau ohne Schatten"" huge admirer(addicted,just to be honest)as I am,I can't refrain myself to say;this production is nothing less than remarkable! I loved to hear gorgeous Peter Seiffert performing the Emperor in his whole regal,strong tenor voice,Luana De Vol is just perfect both singing and acting this very,very difficult part(she's amazing and in fresh voice on act 3),Janis Martin can sing her part just like it's in the score contrary to shout terribly that all time(such a rare event;to hear Strauss vocal lines just like he put it on paper!),the whole cast is so well prepared that one can surely believes Sawallisch is the legitimate authority on this magnificent Strauss score. The huge orchestra and chorus are both great as well. Besides,in these bizarre production times and directors' emotional disorders  absolutism,this dvd is just a heavenly,refreshing sight. Splendid costumes and stage setting catches properly that Hoffmansthal's fairy tale spirit. The final scene(the emperor and his wife over the bridge)is just to die for.",1177286400,25,1054,5.387878787878788
2745245,5,B000MRP1YQ,"Now there are two:  Solti and Sawallisch.  In most aspects, this wonderful Sawallisch production clearly trumps Sir Georg Solti's recorded just two months earlier.  First, Sawallisch's cast sings expressively, accurately, and musically without the heavy sweating and harsh vocalism that pervades Solti's.  Secondly, Sawallisch claims Die Frau  his favorite opera, and his enthusiasm is everywhere evident. Solti's reading seems dispassionate, workmanlike, and oddly colorless in spite of the ravishing sound of the Vienna Philharmonic. Sawallisch and the Bavarians aim at lightness, clarity, nuance, and color; while the pace can be a bit too fast (e.g. the final bars of Act III), Sawallisch's expressiveness is welcome alternative to Solti's flatland reading. Finally, and most importantly, the soloists here are stronger, more balanced, and in greater control of the opera's extreme demands.  In particular, Janis Martin's Dyer's Wife sings this tortuous role with &eacute;lan aural pleasantness in spite of her shrewish character's persona.  By not sounding like a harridan (as Eva Marten does in Solti's), we are more likely to believe her redeeming qualities.  As the Empress, Luana DeVol's transparent voice is immediately perceived in her opening moments:  those athletic arabesques, set in an uncomfortably high tessitura, indicating the Empress's ethereal fragility, are sung pitch perfect - a rather unique accomplishment as this role goes.  Alan Titus's Barak, while relaxed, is beautifully sonorous.  Peter  Seiffert's Emperor may be the best interpretation since Rene Kollo who practically owned the role a couple of decades ago. Marjana Lipovsek,  the Nurse here and on Solti's disc, is phenomenal in coursing through the jagged and unforgiving barbwire music that Strauss sadistically throws at this villainess.

 The production by Ennosuke Ichikawa is a hybrid of Kabuki and Western staging.  Characters from Ethereal and Middle worlds (Messenger, Empress, Emperor, Nurse) are in Kabuki dress and move and gesture accordingly.  Bara k, his wife and brothers, representing humanity, looking more like Afghan nomads, seem rather smaller than life.  The intersection of their fates, juxtaposing the detached idealism of Kabuki with the all-to-human lives of the Baraks,  provides yet another way of unifying the concepts of Light and Dark in von Hofmannsthal vision.  In an Eastern setting, Strauss's leaping grace notes, which abundantly adorn the Nurse's role, now seem fittingly Japanese-like.

The few drawbacks in this new DVD might compel some prefer the Solti:  Sawallisch takes cuts throughout, while Solti insists (rightly) on an unabridged performance.  The timings indicate about a twenty-minute difference.  Also, the DTS post-processing on this disc is not as vibrant as on Solti's.  Finally, the Vienna Philharmonic is the more polished  machine.  In a perfect world one should buy Sawallisch's first, and if you really love the work, purchase Solti's, as an indulgence, for a note-complete performance.",1176854400,51,3031,5.662971175166297
2745246,5,B000MRP1YQ,"This production from the Bavaian opera on tour in Japan was created to celebrate Sawallish's 25 year association with the NHK orchestra and his farewell to the Bavarian. It is his favorite opera and it shows. What we have is my nomination for opera DVD of 2007 - productions like are alas seldom seen today.

The production side was given to Japanese artists, Westerners provided the music. Hofmanstall envisioned Frau taking place in the South Pacific but there is nothing particularly Asian about the music. Indeed most productions ignore the Eastern locale. Not here. The celestials come from Kabuki theater. The earthlings wear generic peasant. And when you see it you realize, yes, this is it.

Ichikawa honors the libretto insuring a production that would have delighted its authors. This is a work of magic and it is available for our delectation - magic falcon, flying fish, a sword. The earthquake at the Act 2 finale will knock your socks off only to be outdone by the finale itself. He even manages to make the shodow visible.

The performane itself is better than we might hope for today. The sopranos are overtaxed at times and for once the men lead the day. But no one is less than fine. And Sawallish's conducting sings his love for this beautiful score although he makes some cuts which bring it in at 2:52 rather than Solti's 3:15. I think he is also faster than the Solti which is also excellent but only  very good visually. It does not take your breath away. It does not make you a child again.",1176076800,46,1514,4.659176029962547

8171454,5,B000MRP1YQ,"This opera is the greatest of R.Strauss operas.  As the title of the opera  ""Lady without a shadow"", one of the mos difficult part in producing this opera is to show no shadow on the title role, yet show a shadow for others. The lighting was achieved with great techniques. Stage production is also outstanding along with the conductor who is thoroughly familiar with the composer.  This is the best production by far.

8171455,3,B000MRP1YQ,"I do not generally watch opera on DVD but saw this through the kind offices of a friend. I prefer either to be able to concentrate on the sound-world via CD using my mind's eye or to enjoy the spectacle live and holistically rather than distanced and filtered through a screen. However, I readily recognise that DVD has its place for certain tastes and would welcome this one both as an historic occasion and as a coherent, honest realisation of this spectacular opera, mercifully free of Regietheater nonsense.

The kabuki theme for the spirit world works well but there are drawbacks: portly singers are not flattered by the costumes and the flapping hawk is plain silly. The contrast provided by dressing the actors of the human world in some kind of central Asiatic garb is effective but I can't say I was bowled over by the effects such as fishes in the pan, and representing the Golden Fountain with two flunkeys wibbling bolts of golden cloth down the staircase is just weak. The whole production is very dark; fair enough, most of the action takes place at night or inside a mountain but that's hard going on screen.

Musically, it's first rate as you would expect from Sawallisch directing the Bavarian State Opera in his favourite Strauss work, but it cannot compare in absolute terms with the finest recordings. The best singers are Lipovsek, who is powerful and persuasive as the scheming Nurse, and Seiffert, whose light but penetrating tenor, with its fast vibrato and steely steadiness, inhabits the role of Emperor very successfully. Next best is a singer I simply did not know, Luana DeVol, as the Empress; she has staying-power and amplitude, even if she is no Rysanek. Janis Martin struggles as the Dyer's Wife; her voice becomes shrill and harsh above the stave. New Yorker Alan Titus is a bluff, dependable Barak who maintains legato very satisfyingly in his lyrical passages and acts well, even if he, like all his co-singers, is ungainly of figure.

On specific irritation: for an audience supposedly enraptured by the production, the Japanese punters here are remarkably given to loud, prolonged and percussive coughing during ""quiet"" moments; it's enough to send me scuttling back to studio accounts.",1431388800,,2225,4.928
8171456,5,B000MRP1YQ,"This is really beautiful. The other five-star reviews have it right, and I'm glad I trusted them. Amusingly, by accident I put on the second disk first. Fortunately, I had recently heard the opera on the Met Saturday broadcast, so was more baffled lost. Also fortunately, I still belong to the generation that could watch the second half of a movie first, then the next screening until ""This is where we came in."" So, watching the first part last, I could appreciate the total effect almost as well as if I'd watched it through in order -- which I will next time. This could become almost as much a favorite with me as ROSENKAVALIER.",1396310400,,633,4.56140350877193
8171457,5,B000MRP1YQ,"I still remember the glorious Met production of this opera, in which I saw Eva Marton as the Dyers Wife take her rather muted farewell from the house.  This production surpasses it by far.  Amazingly, Ichakawa and his Japanese team have uncovered the true grandeur of this grand fairy tale.  The principals are all uniformly excellent, but I want to single Janis Martin and Alan Titus, two American singers whom I had the good fortune to watch several times in Met and City Opera productions. Luana de Vol and Peter Seiffert are magnificent, but Lipovsek almost steals the show as the evil Nurse (which she also sings in the Solti recording).  I will venture to say that opera on DVD can almost be better than live!",1373241600,3,715,4.650793650793651
8171458,5,B000MRP1YQ,"I just finished watching FRAU, my favorite German opera, in two forms in one day. First, I watched the glorious Solti performance with the incomparable Cheryl Studer as the Empress and then Sawallisch' s Japanese performance with the the lovely Luanna DeVol. I can't choose, though my lifelong love for Solti and Studer push me in that direction. Eva Martin as the Dyer' s Wife is less than at her best, but she is still Eva, and I loved her! Janis Martin, in the Sawallich set,
sings it better, but I still miss Eva's acting. Peter Seiffert is much better vocally than Tom Moser, but visually I'll take Moser any day. Alan Titus has it all over Bob Hale as Barak, but still there are winning things about Hale' s vulnerability. In short, what do I do? I am not willing to part with Studer' s glorious Empress nor with Martin's Dyer' s Wife, not to mention Seiffert and Titus. I guess I'm just glad I have both five star performances. And Mariana Lipovsek in both sets is supreme as the Amme! Bravo!",1371168000,4,999,4.46448087431694

Directed and staged by a Japanese team, it is highly faithful to the Strauss-Hofmannsthal conception and, in the words of the Bavarian opera company, displays ""a profound knowledge of the work.""  The opposing groups of protagonists are distinguished visually by their clothing.  The emperor, empress, nurse, and other residents of the southeastern islands and spirit world are attired in elegant Japanese costumes.  Barak, his wife, and brothers wear simple peasant garb.  The special effects (for example, the descent of the flaming sword near the end of act 2) are all impressive; the golden bridge in the finale is spectacular.  And the video and audio recording--by NHK Japanese television--is extremely well done.  All this would be for naught without excellent singing, but the cast is strong throughout.  Wolfgang Sawallisch, an acclaimed interpreter of Strauss, provides superb musical leadership.  Some standard cuts are taken, but most viewers will not miss them.

8171462,5,B000MRP1YQ,"Richard Strauss's Die Frau ohne Schatten is his grandest work, a three-act fairy tale on an enormous scale. The piece requires seven stellar singers, a giant orchestra, and a panoply of visual effects to depict events on three different planes of existence as the story follows the marital troubles of two couples in their struggle to conceive children. This stunning production was filmed in Nagoya, Japan in 1992, was scheduled for broadcast on Japanese television, but objections from that country's censors led to the broadcast never being aired.

The mythology of this opera was created by Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Strauss' frequent librettist. An Emperor and an Empress, married for a year, have no children. She is the daughter of the fairy-king Keikobad. The Empress learns that she has three days to gain a shadow, (a symbol of her fertility) or her husband will be turned to stone. Aided by her Nurse, the Empress travels to the human world to buy a shadow, and encounters another troubled couple: the dyer Barak and his wife. After a series of trials, both couples are rewarded with the promise of long happiness and children to come.

Japanese director Ennosuke Ishikawa's mounts the opera with elements of Noh plays and elaborate costuming to create the three worlds of the opera: the fairy realm, the royal palace of the Emperor and Empress, and the humble hovel of the Baraks. Tomio Morhi's costumes are impressive, from the simple homespun for the dyer and his wife to the full, elaborate kabuki costume (complete with multi-tiered crown) worn by Peter Seiffert as the Emperor. The sets are minimal and effective, using the ""zones"" of Noh theater to make the most complex moments in the opera clear and easily understood.

It is a credit to soprano Luana DeVol that she makes an engaging, human character of the somewhat abstract Empress--and that she communicates effectively through the heavy, white makeup. From her fluttering, flighty entrance, she walks a complicated path. This is a tough role, made more difficult in that the Empress is mostly mute in the second act. At the climax (in a temple before the rapidly petrifying body of her husband) displaying power and resolve in that spoken monologue, which earns her the shadow and reunites the four couples for an ensemble climaxing in a glorious unision high C.

Janis Martin sings with great power and precision in the equally difficult role of the Dyer's Wife, a character, like many Strauss heroines, based on the composer's famously difficult wife Pauline. But it is mezzo-soprano Marjana Lipovsek who is simply stunning as the Nurse, the ambivalent ""helper"" who becomes the opera's antagnist as the plot develops. Her final scene in the third act, with its thrilling high note at the end, is one of the most rewarding parts of this performance.

The men are not to be left out. Peter Seiffert's Emperor is caught here early in a fine career, displaying an agile heldentenor with youth and bloom. Alan Titus, an underrated baritone, is a wonderful Barak, with dark, rich tones and a feeling of heavy resignation at the status of his difficult marriage. Jan-Hendrik Rootering is a towering, imposing presence. The bass plays the Spirit Messenger in full samurai armor and with a rich, black-toned bass that simply resonates with authority.

These performances of Frau marked Wolfgang Sawallisch's last bow as director of the Bavarian State Opera. The maestro has perfect control over his sprawling forces, leading the most complicated and intricate passages in the score with a sure hand. The famously difficult last act, with its panoply of offstage choruses, ringing fanfares and duets sung by physically separated singers is a challenge for any conductor. Mr. Sawallisch is now retired, but these DVDs show why he was considered to be one of the greatest Strauss conductors in the world.",1305072000,30,3866,5.023400936037442
