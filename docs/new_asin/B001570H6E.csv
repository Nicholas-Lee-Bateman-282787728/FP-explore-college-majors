8257637,5,B001570H6E,"Showing both doctors' daughters' with paralysis was very heartening. I kept pausing the movie 4 times because I started crying. One daughter was more athletic, outgoing, vivacious, extroverted; while the other daughter had worse injuries (she lost the use of one hand, besides her legs. She was more introspective, artistic, musical, introverted. Something about daughters, ""instead of"" sons had functional/emotional meanings; Not being able to be a mother; Stem cells are made from eggs not sperm. I understood the connection.

The Catholic Priest's comments vs. the Scientist's comments; Ya gotta hand it to that priest. I dunno where they found him and how they got him to be on the video..but he profusely and fragrantly espoused theological Catholic Canon Law; while the scientist professed reason and logic. It was classic, textbook stuff. I don't want to spoil it and give examples of quotes..

One aspect underlying the other two was the mechanical, laborious, laboratory process'. The ""Lab Rats"", figuratively and literally speaking were passionately depicted",1373587200,,1068,5.466666666666667
8257638,4,B001570H6E,"I used this film to compliment my classroom studies on the topic of stem cells this year. The mix of scientific, social, and political issues made the topic more enjoyable for the students. I also really liked that the patients/characters were female. It was interesting to see their strength and struggles through their hardships in life. If you are a teacher, consider using this in your science classroom.",1357948800,2,408,5.014705882352941
8257639,5,B001570H6E,"As a college student deeply interested in stem cell research, this film has been instrumental for me in many ways. It is not only highly informative, but also very moving. Despite the heavy scientific research, many discussions are simultaneously brought to the front, such as  that between science and religion. However, it should not be forgotten that, at its core, this is also the story of a father and his daughter, and this adds a highly personal element to the film. All in all, it is a must see! It is best if you view it in groups, because the dialogue it leads to is priceless!",1277856000,,587,4.537735849056604
8257640,5,B001570H6E,"This film is a partial case studying stem cells--as defined by: [...]  We get to learn about stem cells mainly from the perspectives of the protagonists--the Kesslers: teenage daughter coping with spinal cord injury, and father practicing research medicine in the filed of stem cells.  Additionally, the viewer gets snapshots of another Kessler-like family, and the political and ethical/moral/religious environments surrounding stem cells.  In the end, there is no conclusion other than the fact that stem cells are conceptually situated in an axiomatic lock-up.  I, for one, hope the Kesslers will prevail in their quest--both at personal and medical/research levels.  As for the society, it will have to do what societies do.

The film(/viewer?) itself could probably be better served by a better title, or explanation, managing the expectations of the audience.  If you come to the film accepting that it's an open ended and partial conversation about stem cells then this is a 5-star production.  Otherwise, adjust accordingly.",1221782400,3,1032,5.446540880503145
8257641,4,B001570H6E,"As founding editor of the online magazine, ReadTheSpirit, one of our founding principles is that our search for Truth must take us into unexpected territory -- and that one of our deepest spiritual concerns must be for the lives of people living around us. My strong recommendation of this new documentary is based on those two principles.

On balance, the film takes a pro-research point of view -- and it's part of the intelligent dialogue we are called to have with the world, as people of faith. The people you'll meet in this film have strong moral and spiritual principles at work in their lives, as well, even if their individual spiritual paths may not coincide with our own.

What's more, you'll almost certainly come away from this documentary learning something new about the nature of this scientific research. The film charts an intriguing series of experiments at Northwestern University that suggest stem cells may hold potential in healing spinal-cord injuries. Watch for yourself and you'll see the work spelled out -- as well as the research's limitations.

You'll certainly meet some fascinating people who've agreed to vulnerably and honestly share their life stories with us. Unless you've a heart of stone -- and few of us do -- you'll warm immediately to the stories of two young women with spinal-cord injuries who open their lives to us in the film. These are bright, funny, multi-talented women who you'll enjoy meeting. And, it's important that we do meet folks like this, because this issue ultimately is about human life.

I appreciate that the producers and the central scientist in the film, Dr. Jack Kessler, insisted on opening up issues of religious belief throughout the 83-minute documentary. Now, you may take issue with the way Kessler and a colleague at Northwestern sketch out religious points of view. There's an eloquent Catholic ethicist who appears in the film, as well -- and you may agree or disagree with him as you watch this movie.

That's precisely why the film is a great choice for small groups. Buy a copy and watch it with your Bible study group, your weekly prayer group, your monthly discussion circle. You'll have plenty to talk about when this film ends.",1212192000,2,2212,4.919571045576408
