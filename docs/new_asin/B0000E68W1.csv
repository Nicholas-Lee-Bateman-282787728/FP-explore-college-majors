1937894,1,B0000E68W1,"Lauren Holly (Dumb & Dumber, No Looking Back) stars as Buckley Clarke, a detective who is on a case of a serial killer who sticks needles into the victims. One of the victims happenes to be the sister of Samuel Browne, played by Robert Patrick (The X-Files, The Unit) who is a Tracker. He tracks animals and so on but when he gets the word on his sister he goes off to try to track down the killer who killed her. This leads to him and Holly pairing together. He thinks he knows what he's doing and she thinks that it's ridiculous until is obviously becomes clear to her that he might be right. The killer, played by Alex Duncan, is actually an Albino looking bugger who has a reason for doing so. Pretty boring and predictable with annoying performances except for Patrick (with his super duper tracking stick)...yes, Holly was annoying and bad in this movie. Not much here and Patrick tries his best to hold everything together but it falls down on the ""Pavement"" at the beginning and from then on it becomes ridiculous as it grows to the ending. I recommend it only for Robert Patrick fans (which I am) but other then that...nahh!",1146355200,2,1133,4.478260869565218
1937895,3,B0000E68W1,"IF you're an X-files fan, you might enjoy this movie just due to the fact that Two X-file alumni star in the leading roles. Granted ""T-1000"" Robert Patrick or ""Dogget"" on the X-files wasn't the most popular character in the show, but Lauren Holley was on of the original. SO seeing them together in a movie about murder and mystery and spooky things, it's all good to me.",1100304000,2,371,4.470588235294118
1937896,1,B0000E68W1,"I can't believe I wasted my time watching this flick.  Having a tracker assist the police, contaminating crime scenes, interviewing witnesses would never happen. Realism went out the window there.  Not to mention ""the guys who can't shoot straight"" police and FBI units.

 If the revenge seeking villain didn't want to live why didn't he just committ suicide and save us all from wasting our time with this movie",1092096000,6,412,4.927536231884058

I don't think it did, so why is this review and ""for sale"" here?",1034035200,,121,3.6538461538461537
1937898,2,B0000E68W1,"This video is almost entertaining until it gets to a part where pretty boy front man, Mad Malkmus, and loverboy Bob  Nastanovich are french kissing with their shirts off.  I guess thats why this freakish film is only out in France.  Believe it  or not, while most bands are releasing movies of thier live performances and interviews of the band, the silver jewish spoon boys of Pavement have taken the high road with NO-LIMIT soldier Master P and have released a work of fiction. Very strange trip.",993686400,,498,4.689655172413793

Detective Buckley (LAUREN HOLLY) finds a nurse killed with dozens of hyperemic needles used to help ""kill"" her. The Brother (ROBERT PATRICK) a tracker from Alaska shows up to find who did it. As yet more bodies show up with the same means of death, they have one thing in common they are ""medical"" workers of some kind. When a doctor is also killed who specialty is premature infants, the investigation goes in yet another direction. The Killer is not killing random strangers but has an clear ""list"" and agenda he is following. Tracker Patrick helps by following the killers escape trail to a bus line. Holly figures the killer is taking the bus for the disabled. So the clues finally add up to a ""very"" unusual killer who decides every one has to ""pay"" for his ever being born. This is very well done. Holds the interest. And best of all a very unusual killer has everyone guessing who what when where and especially why. 5 STARS~",1488758400,,971,4.580459770114943

It is a rare, suspenseful movie, with good acting, and Robert Patrick, we see very little of these days.  He is excellent in this movie.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.",1376006400,,299,4.381818181818182
