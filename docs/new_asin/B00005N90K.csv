7946494,5,B00005N90K,"I ordered this ""boxset"" and was given just individual copies of the movie.  Is that a bad thing?  No, because you can arrange them in a more alphabetically logical way then.  So don't be surprised if you don't get them in a ""boxset"".  Now to the titles in this product...

Cobra (1986) - This is like the Stallone equivalent to Schwarzenegger's Commando.  Pointless cool action scenes with our beloved action hero.  The film itself is WS on one side, FS on the other side, 5.1 surround sound (which was really cool by the way), director's commentary, behind the scenes featurette, trailers, etc.  Not too shabby for a low key film like this.

Demolition Man (1993) - Another one of those too high-tech for it's own good futuristic action flicks.  You know the type, where the future looks completely out of style for what it'll actually end up being in that technology runs everything almost too well... only you've got Stallone and Snipes blowing everything up.  One side is WS, the other side is FS, it's all in 5.1 surround sound, and it features a director & producer's commentary.  Works for me.

Driven (2001) - Stallone in racing movie by Renny Harlin.  Not much else to say, but the film is in WS, with deleted scenes, director's commentary, and a featurette.  What really makes this cool is the surround sound.  5.1, very cool, very engulfing, especially during the racing scenes.

Now this whole set is pretty cheap, which makes it a steal for all the technical quality and the sheer entertainment they put into it.  Also, each film is in a snap case.",1280275200,7,1561,4.676470588235294
