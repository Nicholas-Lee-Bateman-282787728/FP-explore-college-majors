8760291,5,B01F6EHOXU,"Very intriguing from the very beginning, the binding kept me on the edge of my seat to the very end.  Excellent cast of actors directed gracefully to a well thought out and written script. I was both scared and entertained the entire movie.",1472342400,2,240,4.5813953488372094
8760292,2,B01F6EHOXU,"The Binding has an interesting premise that it simply isn't smart enough or well acted enough to pull off--if you truly believe in God and the stories in The Bible, how can you completely dismiss someone who claims to be seeing visions of God?  And what if the voice that this person is hearing commands him to do something truly horrible?  How do you convince a person with fervent religious faith that what he is seeing isn't real?  If you are a believer yourself how do you know for certain that it isn't real?  Particularly when what the voice is asking echoes a very famous story from The Bible?

The Binding isn't really able to walk this psychological tightrope for very long, partly because the actors lack the skill to bring their characters alive and make them into something more than one-dimensional creations in someone's indie horror film.  Lead actor Max Adler is in way over his head as the either crazy or genuinely vision seeing minister who doesn't know whether to succumb to what he believes to be the will of God or to listen to his wife, his minister and his psychiatrist and resist the command--which involves sacrificing his infant child to prevent a coming apocalypse.  It's a tricky part to navigate but Adler is never capable of making his character seem anything other than crazy--which is a big problem since it's possible that his character isn't crazy at all.

The Binding ultimately bites off more than it can chew in terms of ambition, not only lacking the ability to make the is-he-or-isn't-he-seeing-God element work at all but also failing to generate virtually any suspense even though the movie involves the potential murder of a baby--and possibly even the end of the world.

Unfortunately, The Binding is just flat, dull, awkwardly written and stiffly acted--and it squanders a great idea because nobody involved behind or in front of the camera has the talent or imagination to actually pull it off.  I would ultimately give The Binding a B+ for ambition but an F for execution.  I definitely can't recommend this movie and would strongly suggest that people interested in similar subject matter check out The Rapture (1991) or Take Shelter (2011) instead.",1470700800,,2197,4.847593582887701
8760293,3,B01F6EHOXU,"Sarah (Amy Gumenick) is married to reformed drinker and minister Bram (Josh Heisler). They just had a daughter. Bram gets visions and a voice from God that he must kill his daughter (binding of Abraham, Isaac etc.) to prevent the apocalypse...which is part of prophecy.

The story is a long drawn out drama of Sarah taking precautions to isolate the child while getting her husband professional help, talking to everyone including Stuart Pankin. While the ending proved interesting, it took too long to develop to get there.

This is a film religious people might enjoy more than the rest of us as it concerns tests of faith.

8760294,5,B01F6EHOXU,"Great film! I really enjoyed it. Really well done!

The plot was really intriguing. The storytelling and set up was clear and concise, making it easy to follow and easy to get wrapped up in. The cast is really strong. All the the main characters were incredibly captivating in their own ways, especially Amy Gumenick who had such raw emotion and vulnerability, all while maintaining her strength! It's wonderful to see strong women on screen!

The whole film was gorgeous! Beautiful cinematography!! Consistent, precise, and a great additive to the tension, emotion, and confusion. I loved all the long shots; it made for a really neat style used throughout the film; the film has a lot of long scenes -- long in a great way -- and the way they're shot is intriguing.

On the note of long scenes, I must say, it's not everyday you see a film that is so character and story driven. So many filmmakers get wrapped up in creating flashy tricks and jump scares, that they forget to tell a decent story along the way.

The Binding is a terrific psychological thriller! That Krieger guy knows what he's doing!",1470009600,3,1103,4.670103092783505
