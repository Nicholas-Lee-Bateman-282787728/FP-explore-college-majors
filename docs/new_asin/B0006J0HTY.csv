It's a wonderful French movie so thought I would order the DVD which was available from France since no Region 1 or 0 was available.  I own an LG 3D Disc player, Model BD670 which allows users the capability of changing the country code.  I went into the lock mode and changed the country code to France and the DVD would not play.  I tried every single country code available and still the DVD would not play.  A message kept coming up to check the country code.  I don't know if I will ever be able to use this DVD, but plan to keep in in the hopes I will one day be able to watch it.",1486512000,,646,4.0078125
