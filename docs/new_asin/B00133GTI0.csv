8249012,5,B00133GTI0,"Amazing, and great content. This is one of my favorite DVD's.  Techniques were great, and instruction was more than adequate.",1365552000,,125,5.25
8249013,4,B00133GTI0,"I'm a Laurence Juber fan & trying to become a better player of altered tunings. I have books & instrucional dvd's on altered tunings, & I must say that the dvd's are the way to go. They are, simply, much more effective and helpful. I really don't need to know WHY altered tunings work as they do, I just want to get good at them. I am studying technique [1st], styling [2nd], & theory [last]. Of all the media I now own, I get the most out of the Laurence Juber dvd's. His other one about DADGAD is actually more helpful on technique; whereas, this dvd is more helpful on styling. I forgive the theory parts on both because I might even want to know that, too, one day. I find them both easy to follow and navigate. They are also well produced. The ability to choose from 3 viewing angles in this dvd is a very nice feature. I also appreciate the way he demonstrates techniques then shows a performance segment right behind it to show the entire song as it should be played [uninterrupted, but because is is a dvd, you can choose to pause, rewind, replay, etc.]  I believe he has given sufficient detail to learn these songs, and I would give this dvd a 5-star rating if he had only given a bit more. There's room for it and is actually needed in a few places. That said, I still highly recommend it. There's a wealth of information here for anyone wanting to be playing a half dozen songs in DADGAD right away. There is much to learn and he is a very good teacher.",1302307200,4,1465,4.250896057347671
8249014,4,B00133GTI0,I have learned a lot from this dvd. I found the inclusion of tabs to go along with the lessons extremely helpful.,1285113600,,113,4.181818181818182
8249015,1,B00133GTI0,"There is very little teaching going on in this video.  It is a guy telling you what he is going to do, and then he does it.  Little detail, he assumes that you know all the chords in DADGAD. I gained no understanding of DADGAD-even though that is the claim for the video.",1284681600,3,271,4.09433962264151
