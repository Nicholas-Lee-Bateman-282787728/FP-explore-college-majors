8380377,1,B000I5X1TY,"I found this video very poorly produced. As far as Aikijujitsu content? The entire content was all Karate, I saw about .01% of Aikijujitsu in this video. In my 33 years in Aikijujutsu growing up in Japan and Korea, I think this is the possibly worst video of Aikijujutsu I or my students have ever seen. Sorry, I would not reccomend this to anyone who wants to learn Aikijujitsu. Some Karate maybe.",1235088000,2,398,4.541666666666667
