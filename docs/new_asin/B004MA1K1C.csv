4429106,5,B004MA1K1C,"In this documentary, the movie pokes fun at the way our society has evolved from a society that worships god to one that uses god for our own purposes.  Even though I'm a devout Christian, I found myself laughing out loud at the clever way points were made throughout the movie.  It reminds me of the Michael Moore style of documentary which pokes fun while making even those he's making fun of, find him funny. I saw this movie in the theater and am so excited to get it and show it to my friends.  What a genius piece of work.",1301097600,21,528,4.207920792079208

4429114,1,B004MA1K1C,"Not really a documentary. Maybe a comedy? Certainly not about the commercialism of Christianity. Reading the reviews I assumed it would be about literal selling but it's marketing, clearly they didn't watch it. Also it's a shame that they went with comedy/satire instead of an actual documentary because it has some interesting interviews. I would have liked to hear more of what they had to say and less from the likes of Falwell. Then seriously?!?!? to have the Westboro Baptist Church represent anything having to do with real Christians is ridiculous. Clearly this isn't meant to be taken seriously. I would have liked to hear more from the man in the Epilogue who so eloquently states what modern Christians are for. I also appreciate the views of the PhD's who don't believe the same way I do but had interesting takes on Christianity. This could have been something great but the narration was so far off base. It's a shame to waste their time. I wonder if they knew how the ""documentary"" was going to be presented.",1485993600,,1022,4.779661016949152

4429116,2,B004MA1K1C,"The most telling thing about this documentary is what major religion he leaves out entirely. Probably a wise decision because they don't take so kindly to being told that basically believe in a fairy tale. Beyond that which was entirely expected, there's nothing new to see here. Rehashed facts and healthy does of hyperbole. Every religion on earth is a business. Some more successful than others, but a business none the less. But even so, if believing in one thing or another helps some folks get by, or gives comfort when needed, it not such a bad thing. At the end of the day it's important to remember that whatever you believe, man created the business part of religion, not God.",1485129600,,686,4.677685950413223

4429118,3,B004MA1K1C,"To paraphrase George Orwell, the worst advertisement for Christianity is its adherents and this documentary cleverly analyzes evangelical Christianity in marketing terms.  Many of the observations are keen; others, less so.  But it addresses an issue that is complicated and vital and does so with humour and without spite.  'Weaponized Christianity' - the blatant, deliberate injection of Christian fundamentalism into the political system - has actually been a part of American culture for some time.  I believe Alexis DeTocqueville raised the spectre in the early 1800's.  But it has become more marked in the last 50 years.  Its philosophical approach is entirely nihilistic, a world where thought-crime is always a threat.  So, despite its very, very low-budget (in some scenes, the lighting was so bad that it was hard to see) and occasional tacky jokes, I would recommend it, especially as a primer for those who don't know much about the topic",1484006400,,951,5.217105263157895

4429120,5,B004MA1K1C,"I will admit that they could have gone with a more animated narrator, but this is pure satirical gold. There is so much truth in this film and it is presented with humor. Evangelism is big business in this the US. People are persuaded to turn over vast amounts of money to preachers who become rich, buy huge mansions, and live way above their blind followers. Every day there are stories of religious leaders who have been caught embezzling donations. Cheap plastic icons are everywhere. People will give up their hard earned money to shysters who promise redemption, healing, and an eternal nirvana. Religion is used to dictate to the masses the people they should hate.  In all of this, we should be angry, very angry. This film gives us a way to look at the ridiculousness of religion in our country and laugh about it.",1483142400,,823,4.636986301369863
4429121,1,B004MA1K1C,"I was really disappointed by this film.  First, I was disappointed by the fact that the movie was not very professional in its presentation.  I was surprised to see this movie on Amazon Prime, since it appears that it was very cheaply made, utilizing standard fonts available on basic computer platforms (my guess is that the font is ""Papyrus""), and it sounds like the director narrated the film while using his computer microphone.  Further, the movie itself disappointed, because the investigative journalism done here was in no way presented objectively, which would have really helped the director's agenda.  For example, within the first couple minutes, the director lists a number of things that most Christians agree on, while even a rudimentary investigation into this would show the director's conclusions to be false.  Any thinking liberal or conservative student of American religion would agree with this.  I really liked the ""idea"" of the movie, but found the title and description to be very misleading.  I was under the impression that the film would share actual, verifiable evidence to prove his argument, rather than grabbing bits and pieces of information and soundbytes to use as fuel for ranting.  I like the idea, but would like to see a different filmmaker create a film on the topic with more objectivity and professionalism, both content-wise and production-wise.",1483056000,2,1388,5.192825112107624

They have this do as I say, not as I do approach. Of course we all know that being a televangelist is a very lucrative career!

It's so corrupt because you can't question the word of ""God"". I don't question anyone's belief. Go believe what you want. But it shouldn't cost you 10% of your salary to have a belief.

4429132,3,B004MA1K1C,"This documentary lacks insight. It's just preaching to the choir. It only confirms what most anyone could either infer through brief observation or otherwise knows through personal experience.

A subject like this one is deserving of a more thorough inspection, one that not only highlights the issues belying the culture but offers further insight into the machine and the people that make it move.

This doc is too content to merely show the things that are already happening. It does not get the mind to race with new ideas. It doesn't give the mind food for thought.

On top of all this, the production quality is bare minimum. That in and of itself is not that big an issue since plenty of other documentaries come with poor presentation. Its greatest weakness is its lack of a strong voice on the matter. It comes across as passing sarcasm instead of the sort of dire concern it should convey.",1472169600,,899,4.713375796178344

a battle between completely cartoonish depictions of Heaven and Hell, and crudely caricaturing orthodox Christians as somewhat dimwitted, gullible, and inarticulate. I also have to mention that it was produced by a Unitarian organization. And that Unitarianism is an religion with no distinct doctrine or written codex -- it is similar to Hinduism in that respect: it is a compilation of cut-and-pasted elements from a number of faiths.

If you're a non-believer, chances are, you already know a fair bit of what's in this film. No real big surprises here - religion has been used to keep people in line for thousands of years (not exactly groundbreaking material here). If you're believer, you'll undoubtedly be offended by the trivialization of the Bible's contents, and possibly by the very notion that thoughts and ideas outside of Christianity exist.

This documentary examines the evangelical movement within the church in a mildly jocular manner.

Here's the scoop. Writer/director Carl Christman (that must be a ghost name) tackles various aspects of said evangelical movement, such as prayer, faith, Heaven and Hell, etc and shows the views of the big names in the evangelical movement (Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell et al) and how they clash with science, contemporary culture and just plain logic. It appears all too easy a task.

I'm not one to say science is always correct. They have a pretty whacky history all by themselves, but I'm pretty certain the Earth is more than 10,000 years old. I'm also not going to blame the ACLU and pro-rights groups for the horror of 911. And why aren't women allowed in the upper echelons of the church? History moves forward and as many bad things there are that happen, humans seem to be a generally decent bunch overall. Yes there have been Hitlers and Stalins but, by and large, they are few and far between. It's just a shame their actions harm such a large number of people. So why does the church want to keep us down with guilt and fear of damnation? And gays. What is the church's problem with gays? It's my understanding that, through studies of twins separated at birth, homosexuality is predominantly in the genes. Doesn't that make it God's will?

I could have used a bit less whimsy in the tone. Upending a religious platform is a tough road to begin with. You are going to tick a lot of people off. Doing so with humor can't help your cause. But still, there is much here to ponder. There are some knowledgeable talking heads present to lend logic to the arguments and they're good arguments.

This is a part of a larger movement taking a closer look at the history of Christianity. It deserves to be seen.",1364169600,2,2120,4.6756032171581765
4429176,3,B004MA1K1C,"The short fact is: Jesus is not for sale.

If one would just look at the words of Christ and take them for what they say, they would see quickly that most professing christianity is actually anti-Christ.

I appreciated the hypocrisy the film-maker points out but it is clear he is ignorant to what a real Christian is. Simply put, a real Christian is a follower of Christ. That means they look to Christ to learn how to live, not to their denomination, doctrine, dogma, etc. Most of Christ's teachings can be found in Matthew chapters 5, 6 and 7. Take a quick look at compare what Jesus taught to what your church is teaching (or, if you are an atheist or profess some other religion, compare it to what the professing christians you know are teaching or living out). I am sure you will see that they are actually anti-Christ. If they are anti-Christ, that means they are NOT Christians! Try not to confuse the real with the false.

An example: just a few minutes into this film a man says, ""Modern evangelism should be about making friends with God."" Ok, let's say that's true. Where can we look to see how we can be a friend of God? How about with what JESUS said? Yes, that's right. Instead of humanistic, what's-in-it-for-me thinking, let's see what JESUS had to say. He said, ""You are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you."" How many friends would you have if that were your condition of friendship?

Another example: The question was asked in this film, ""Who would Jesus kill?"" Well, once again, we can look to Jesus and see who he would kill. He said, ""Love your enemies. Bless them that curse you. Do good to them that hate you, pray for them who dispitefully use you and persecute you."" Can we love our enemies and kill them? No. Christ was our example. He went as a sheep to the slaughter. He told us to be as harmless as doves. We leave the judging to God. He told us to love. We are to love.

A good message titled ""Jesus Is Not For Sale"" can be heard here:
[ ... ]
As a side note, it is nearly december 25. The current sign on our church says: ""The reason for the season: money."" That's right. It's not about Christ at all. It's about money. Jesus was not even born on dec. 25th and besides that, it's a pagan holiday packaged up with a 'christian' label on it. Hypocrisy.",1355788800,4,2293,4.335664335664336

Hoping for a south park whitty and intelligent approach I was very disappointed.  First, very little of the film actually deals with christian products and product placement.  Instead it uses cliche arguements as it rambles on about the authors issues against christianity.

Ironic for a film critiquing marketing, this video is actually mismarketted.  A better title would be De-selling God as it engages in religious arguements.  Imagine the rightwing making a film on democrats.  This movie carries the same degree of bias and lack of credibility.

If you want a good laugh at Christianity, just turn on TBN or Falwell.  The infrequent humorous content is limited to these clips.  Beyond that, this movie starts selling its own koolaid.",1320969600,6,907,5.0675675675675675
4429179,5,B004MA1K1C,This documentary takes an interesting and comical look at how religion and our faith has been tailored to fit the needs of whomever is yelling the loudest at the time and has the best mass marketing approach. You would only take offense if you are those following the types of churches portrayed in the film. The ideal that controlling the minds of individuals through fear and the promise of salvation if you follow a specific path is not new to religion. I think the underlying theme to this film is to show how far we've reached from the initial intent of religion and God. It's not about doing one to others as you would want done to you or helping the sick and weak. It's about how much money you can collect to build a bigger church and buy more influence in those making decisions about our laws and economy.

Very well produced and historically accurate, funny and at the same time scary. Yes it pokes fun at religion and is a bit over the top but the truth of how religion has evolved is also frightening. It explains why there are so many religious denominations all claiming to be the only true religion; each claiming that if you don't follow its beliefs you're going to hell. It explains why so many faithful hate the equally faithful who don't share the same religious dogma.

To be fair it is one sided but it doesn't really poke fun at average christians but more on their ministers and preachers. This movie is not a history lesson of christianity even though it does give some historical facts here and there through out the documentary. It mainly shows how christianity has changed over the last century and some of the hypocrisies that have occurred. All in all, it was a very fun and interesting documentary. If you are a hard core, fundamentalist christian then you may not enjoy this documentary because it does poke fun at you, and well honestly, it's well deserved.

4429184,4,B004MA1K1C,"This documentary explains the basic ways in which religion grows and supports itself.  I was not surprised to see a few negative reviews here since this film is critical of modern Christianity.  If you are a religious person who doesn't have an open mind then this film will probably offend you.

The film starts out by explaining how religions evolve over time through natural selection.  The religions which have beliefs that promote growth are the ones that survive while others fade to obscurity.  For the rest of the film they explain the strategies and beliefs that help bring money and people to the church.  The film proves their point using many informative interviews and clips from Christian events/promotional materials.

The only criticism I have is that the filmmakers sometimes use humor at the wrong times.  Some of their jokes such as the ""7 basic tenets that all modern Christian denominations agree upon"" came across as arrogant and overly biased.

This documentary provides interesting points and is especially informative if you are not aware of the machinery that drives the business side of religious organizations.",1310169600,9,1138,5.141304347826087
4429185,1,B004MA1K1C,"While ostensibly employing some elements of the documentary film genre, the filmmakers of ""Selling God"", unlike true documentarians, have little substance to offer their viewers. I suppose it is best catagorized as a docudrama.

While the filmmakers do occasionally offer up a nugget of historical fact placed in its proper context, this occurrence is so rare as to be essentially absent. The imprecise and culturally-ignorant interchanging of ""religion"" and ""Christianity"" is as frustrating as it is stultifying. I suppose the filmmakers and commentators could be excused for their cultural insensitivity if they didn't posture themselves as bulwarks of cultured inclusivity. I suppose if you've ""got religion"" in the 21st century United States, that means that you espouse the christianity that they describe in the film? I guess we'll forget about all other religions.

The film is a one-sided presentation of a progressive/liberal viewpoint, masquerading as a historically-sensitive documentary. It glaringly lacks both a good-faith effort to state the opposing position and any pretense of even-handed treatment. The summary of the ""7 basic tenets that all modern Christian denominations agree upon"", offered up 2.5 minutes into the film sums up a large portion of what's wrong with this film:

1) People did not evolve from monkeys.
2) Gay sex isn't natural.
3) Life begins by conception.
4) Guns are good.
5) Hollywood is evil.
6) God is the determining factor in all wars, major sporting events and award shows.
7) To spread the ""good news"".

Even a superficial investigation beyond headlines and media pieces clearly evidences a very large community of self-identified Christians both in the United States and globally who, if asked the question, ""What are the essential tenets of the Christian faith?"" would list none of the 7 that the filmmakers identify. The refusal of the filmmakers to properly frame the issue that they purport to discuss makes their treatment of it something to be avoided... Unless the viewer desires downward expansion of their reference frame for what constitutes a poor film.

It is indeed a refusal and not simply an inability to properly frame issue because there are times in the film where the filmmakers clearly show their ability to clearly and accurately summarize portions of the Christian faith. An example of this can be found beginning at 23:51 where the filmmakers lay out the concept of ""original sin"" using quotations from the writings of St. Paul and video clips from (who else?) Jerry Falwell and anonymous 'man on the street' interviews. Putting aside the distracting snarkiness of the writer and narrator, the filmmakers do actually manage to correctly summarize the doctrine... At least until they conflate the physical human body with the sinful human nature.

The list of commentators that the filmmakers interviewed is instructive. The list of commentators in order of appearance:

- Bill Colwell, Jr. - Adjunct instructor of Health Policy and Management at Loma Linda University.
- Dr. Charles Teel, Jr. - Professor of Religion and Society at La Sierra University (formerly a campus of Loma Linda Univ.).
- Dr. Bob Harvey - Professor Emeritus of Biophysics at UCLA
- Dr. Noam Chomsky - Professor Emeritus of Linguistics, Linguistic Theory, Syntax, Semantics, Philosophy of Language at MIT.
- Nicholas Olevsky, D.D. - Principal of Third Path Ministries, Green Valley Lake, CA.
- Dr. G.W. Abersold - Minister of Highland Congregational Church, San Bernardino, CA.

It is notable that 2/3 of the commentators are elderly. Given the recession of Liberal Christianity over the last 4 decades it must have been difficult to find younger individuals willing to go on record with this view. The various areas of expertise of the interviewees is also interesting. For example, who exactly is Nicholas Olevsky and why did the filmmakers deem him qualified to speak on these matters? I don't mean to pick on the man or to fallaciously appeal to authority, but prior to writing this review, I wasn't able to discover anything verifiable about him, Abersold, or Harvey aside from some of their position titles and business name/location. Using darkhorses in documentaries that omit dissenting views should provoke concern in the mind of any conscientious viewer. I suppose they were trusting Chomsky's name to cover over the crevasse.

Given that the biographies and credentials of some of the commentators are rather hard to come by, it is doubly important to pay attention to their arguments. However, the commentators' comments are notably dominated by assertion and lacking arguments supported by facts. What arguments are given, such as Dr. Harvey's claims regarding the methods and accuracy of textual translation have been answered time and again, by many authors over centuries. A simple search here on Amazon.com will turn up more than a person would ever care to read on the subject, including sound rebuttals to this very tired argument. Throughout the film, facts are stated, often devoid of context, and assertions are made based on those facts but logical arguments, and any dissenting responses, are given the ol' heave-ho. Perhaps that's the fault of the commentators, perhaps of the filmmakers, or perhaps both. Like the number of licks it takes to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop: the world may never know.

While the film is obviously not the proper forum for an academic debate, it would serve the audience better if statements like ""we don't have a complete copy of the New Testament earlier than the 4th century"" (uttered by Dr. Abersold) were either omitted or tempered by the opposing view held by the large majority of contemporary Biblical scholars, both progressive and conservative, that that overwhelming majority of the NT texts date from the first century and are all well-attested. Of course, one could argue that Abersold was referring to the completed canon, but the framework required for anyone to consider or understand such a distinction isn't provided. Failure to interview those with dissenting views, especially when they are so widely held and easily found is bothersome and may prompt the astute viewer to research propaganda techniques and determine how many the filmmakers employed in the production ""Selling God"".

Fans of Michael Moore's latest works, particularly opponents of 'religion' who are uninterested in well-reasoned opposing views are likely to find this film a side-splitting hoot. The tone of both the writing and delivery is droll and the filmmakers are able to keep the film moving along without getting bogged down on any one issue. However, the one-sided presentation of the issues at hand will make it a frustrating thing to watch for any who come looking for a comprehensive, well-reasoned approach to the topic of the religious consumer culture of the contemporary United States.

While the filmmakers do a reasonable job of skewering some of the more obvious (and odious!) manifestations of the christian consumerist in 21st century America, their willful ignorance of what they deem 'religion' renders them incapable of presenting anything approaching an accurate or useful summary treatment of the issues. Mr. Johnson's previous recommendation deserves to be repeated for anyone interested in actually investigating this topic: look up George Marsden.

I wonder if in their presentation of ""Selling God"", the filmmakers aren't themselves trying to sell their audience a bill of goods.",1309305600,19,7517,5.243760399334443
4429186,2,B004MA1K1C,"I don't disagree with the overall premise of this documentary.  As a born-again Christian, I am often disillusioned by the marketing of the Christian church. My hope was that this documentary would taken a balanced approach into the problem.  However, what I found was a poorly made documentary that only utilizes a handful of ""experts"" most of whom do not represent Christianity had have a university after their name.  This documentary basically reviews basic historical Christianity and basic Christine doctrine, then paints large opinionated broad strokes with an effort to be funny that is never realized. The filmmakers don't claim to be Christians, and take an outsiders view point.  However, rather than asking the hard questions, they approach it in a tongue and cheek manor and never really explore the problem.  The only positive I see in this is for those of us who are Christians is to shine a mirror on what those outside the church really think of us.  What is said of the Church in this documentary is both true, and grossly generalized by splicing together clips of the most extreme members of fundamental Christianity. This film is truly a Morgan Spurlock wanna be and never achieves an real informative look at consumerism inside the American Church.
