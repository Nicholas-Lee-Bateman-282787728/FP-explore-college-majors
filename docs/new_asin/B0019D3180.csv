8273515,4,B0019D3180,"The Oscar-nominated film The Battle of Neretva is very good -- in its full-length running time of 175 minutes.  Unfortunately, no version at this length is available anywhere in the world, as of November 2011, anyway.  Of the half-dozen DVD versions available, only the EXTENDED LENGTH Spanish Region 2 version by Sogemedia can be recommended, with the UK Region 2 version coming in a distant second.  The EXTENDED Spanish version uses the same excellent widescreen print as the German DVD (which has only German language and NO subtitles) but has the advantage of language tracks in three languages (Spanish, German, and Italian), and has SUBTITLES IN ENGLISH and Spanish.  It is, however, a Region 2 DVD, and one would need a codefree player to watch it in the US.  At a running time of 144 minutes, it is some 31 minutes short of the original length, but the really good widescreen print makes up for this.  The UK version, which is also Region 2, has the real advantages of a running time of 157 minutes, and a language track in which each nationality speaks its own language (Germans speak German, Italians speak Italian, Yugoslavs speak Serbo-Croatian). This is a real advantage, for example, in the scene in which Orson Welles gives a rallying speech to the Chetniks--it really does sound better in the language the character would have been speaking.  Unfortunately, the UK print, although widescreen, is of marginal to poor quality, and nothing like the near-pristine prints of the EXTENDED Spanish and the German versions.  If you really like this film, you might consider getting the UK version as a second copy, both because it is more complete and because the multilingual soundtrack (with English subtitles) is more authentic.  The marginal to poor quality of the print prevents the UK version from being a first recommendation, however.  The remaining versions, including the truncated US Region 1 version, cannot be recommended because the extensive cuts make the story--already complex--almost incomprehensible.  Stay away from the SHORTENED Spanish and the Hungarian versions in particular--both use absolutely horrible pan and scan prints that are fuzzy and lop off much of the picture on both sides.  The information on the Hungarian DVD case also misrepresents the length--the case claims it is 165 minutes, but the actual length of the DVD is only 102 minutes.  This is a film that cries out to be rescued by Criterion with a definitive Region 1 version--which presumably would either the full 175-minute running length or at least be like the UK version or longer but use the pristine print of the 144-minute EXTENDED  Spanish Sogemedia and German versions for most of the film's running length.  What is needed is the full 175-minute version, in Region 1, in multiple languages (at least English, German, Italian, French, and Spanish, and perhaps Serbo-Croatian as well).  Are you listening, DVD manufacturers?  This is, after all, an Oscar nominated film we are talking about here, and a very good one at that.",1221350400,29,3035,5.050100200400801
