I came away having experienced a handful of visually intriguing scenes, but none the wiser about the man himself.",1495238400,,269,4.294117647058823
8669308,4,B00M0DA2R6,"I recently became acquainted with the recordings and videos of Cameron Carpenter, a remarkable young American organist. Brash, flamboyant even, but with a talent to back it up. This video tells a bit of his life story, introduces us to his parents, teachers and others who have influenced him. We see him working on the design and building of his personal touring instrument. Finally we hear her playing some of his arrangement of the Bernstein ""Candide"" Overture. My only complaint is that I wish we had gotten the complete version of Candide, which is available on YouTube. Definitely not for everyone, but I found it a fascinating portrait of a brash, big ego, and very exciting musician.",1472947200,2,691,4.914529914529915

8669310,4,B00M0DA2R6,"It's always interesting to get into the mind of a genius. especially one who's a bit quirky.  He's a dynamo with talent, technique and brains to burn.  He lives his beliefs--personal freedom and expression with no apologies.  I enjoyed the glimpse into his world.",1464048000,2,263,4.931818181818182

8669312,5,B00M0DA2R6,"As (despite being?) a classically university educated professional (now retired) organist, I am a very big fan of Cameron Carpenter. Not just because he is the most technically proficient organist who ever lived, in the humble opinion of myself and most honest knowledgeable organists--despite carping from jealous organists whose competence is about where Carpenter was at age 8 (I am reminded of those who complained J.S. Bach's music ""had too many notes""). And not just because he goes out on a limb, climbs out of the box, and gives us new music--some better, some not so much (again IMHO, like most serious listeners I have mixed opinions about the work of all composers and concert artists). But also because of his mind. Time spent listening (e.g., on You Tube) to Carpenter discuss music and his viewpoints reveals a deep mind and understanding of music, not just organ music (at what age did you first transcribe a Mahler symphony for keyboard?). I am ecstatic that Carpenter has designed his own innovative digital organ to travel the world with and share his genius (who else gives as many concerts per year?). This DVD and Blu-Ray recording fills in much needed and appreciated information about Carpenter's life.",1431475200,5,1225,5.009803921568627

8669314,5,B00M0DA2R6,"All you wanted to know ... more or less!
  First: Cameron Carpenter is probably THE mostly gifted mind and performer of our or any time.
His mind and abilities are beyond the comprehension of anyone - even a 70 year old multi-degree Doctor of that which is the essence of what Mr. Carpenter is .. a musician, a performer, a composer, an artist, an individual seeking to show himself and others what he can do.
Unfortunately, there is serious doubt that this DVD is going to be a big seller.
Most folks are NOT into esoterica, and that is what this whole panoply of Cameron Carpenter is.
It is not an easy experience.
It reminds one of the ""If You Could Read My Mind""  and that goes way beyond that luscious picture of him on both covers!
His posture screams being in the throws of passionate creation.
His head held high as his creative juices become a musical orgasm of breathless wonder.
His indeed is the total package: mind, body, spirit, craftsmanship and sensuality; all on a level that while a joy to hear for most - is an internal meshing and gearing and cerebral melange exploding into the arena of a world that will never truly have the understanding ability or perhaps, the wanting of such.
  For myself, it is so incredible seeing such a being, being able to be his being.
He exudes a complete confidence in himself and his abilities.
The drawbacks of the DVD are that we really only get a tiny glimpse of the ""Wonder machine:"" when the disc is removed from the container there is a picture of what we really don't get to see in the story - the console.
Oh yes, it is wonderful to follow him through the machinations of the evolution, but then, only a tiny portion of Candide's Overture - something you really need to go to YouTube to experience.
  What a gift it would have been to actually see the organ taken stage by stage into fullness; his drawings and discussions with the builders and the visual manifestations thereof; the behind the scenes parts built and assembled; his inspections and words of candor about what had to have been changed by his countless overseeings.
  And now a word about his appearance. Fascinating. He has found what he NOW feels comfortable with wearing while performing and even walking through this and other videos. Oh yes, his is a nice, well cared-for body. A few very advised professional performers are not impressed.
And, frankly, while loving every molecule of this man, it does not wear well with me.
  Right now, in his youth, he can get away with and enjoy this, but, it also comes over as a bit of ""nose-thumbing,""
  Really, would like to see less of the body and revel more in his priceless mind.
  Oh, and then there are those views of his smoking - come on Sir, you are too valuable to lose to the likes of Cancer; and those poses relaxing on a telephone pole are too close to an image of an element that this mind doesn't want or need.
  Concluding, will continue to try to work with his agents to get him to my home town: Hagerstown, MD, the city that was the home of the M. P. Moller Organ company, which built the most pipe organs in history - over 17,000 - to perform and, maybe, with luck, be able to touch those hands that are unparalleled.",1419465600,7,3208,4.456410256410257
