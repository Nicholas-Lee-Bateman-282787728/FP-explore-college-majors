8332026,5,B001P439GM,"The DVD of this New Orleans jam session is marvelous and represents some of the only video shots of George Lewis, Armand Hug, and Sharkey Bonano, to the best of my knowledge. The audio and video are not the best but considering technology in the early days of television, this DVD is priceless!",1252540800,4,294,4.566037735849057
