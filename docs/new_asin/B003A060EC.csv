4099669,5,B003A060EC,this is what he likes and so I order it I have ord.er 3 others and he loved the movie.,1315526400,,86,3.35
4099670,2,B003A060EC,Good but it needed more about the horses.  The movie needed to explain more about each horse and why that horse went to that particular way in its training and follow each horse more through its training.,1314316800,3,204,4.513513513513513
4099671,2,B003A060EC,"This movie, as several reviews on Amazon and Netflix point out...that yes, it's a MOVIE, not a documentary. The horses are obviously trained for many of the scenes, most implausiblely the horse who runs into the ""wild"". The film follows two trainers coming home from a sale with a yearling horse. The trailer breaks off like magic when the truck skids. The trainers open the trailer doors to check on the horse. One of them takes the bridle off of the horse, and just stands there. The horse runs off into the woods, and the film follows the horse's ""free"" life as it somehow manages to get from countryside to deep forest, where he finds a herd wandering around the woods. The colt and the mare 'fight', which means rearing up and pawing at each other several times. Rearing very well, actually--obviously TRAINED. Horses don't rear constantly, as in films. Also, the horses in the herd happen to be well-groomed, shiny, and have fantastic conformation. PLEASE. Then the film follows the yearling running all over the country, going from heartland fields to...very snowy mountains, and he happens to find another herd! Ugh. If you took it to be a documentary, then the filmmakers would be following an expensive colt, just left to run around in the wild. The other horses are a horse being trained to race and a horse being trained to jump. The jumping horse stumbles in competition. The rider jumps off, suspiciously coordinated, and the horse stands still, very calm and stares at the rider, who lands in the water perfectly. The racehorse runs her first race, winning by several lengths, only the rest of the horses are held back and let her get ahead. More acting. This is just the beginning of the mistakes--I'm just writing a long review b/c I don't want others to get suckered into buying a film that is marketed to be a documentary, but isn't. Some people might like it just for entertainment, or for the gorgeous photography. But be warned. I'm glad I rented it and didn't buy.",1313971200,38,1987,4.712643678160919
4099672,4,B003A060EC,This is a great story and beautifully filmed the whole way through. This is a fun movie to share with friends. I watched it at home first and then watched it with a friend who's a fellow horse lover. I also let my riding instructer borrow it and she took it to a horse show and set up a little outdoor theater with this playing. The kids loved it!,1306972800,,347,4.043478260869565
4099673,5,B003A060EC,"1 Disc Widescreen, released June 8, 2010

""Horses: The Story of Equus"" was financed by the Australian Film Finance Corporation and is the story of three horses: The Chestnut being trained for racing, The Bay being trained for movie stunts, and The Black who on his way to a stud farm gets into an accident and escapes into the wild joining a herd.

The cinematography on this film is breathtaking capturing every beautiful muscle of the horses galloping. Horses are speedy and graceful and always alluring to watch. The stories while clearly set up are very different and give the horses a chance to show their personality in their circumstances.

The Chestnut has issues connecting with its rider and throws her sensationally into a lake. The Bay has a fiery spirit that prevents it from getting close to anyone till the end of the film. The Black gets the most exciting journey of all getting to run free across gorgeous landscapes that are a feast for the eyes.",1283817600,12,964,4.726190476190476
4099674,5,B003A060EC,"I've ridden horses my whole life and competed both in dressage and racing on small time tracks. This film is beautifully and wonderfully, sometimes beyond conception, filmed. Yeah yeah, they make horse training look easy, but any horse person will appreciate the simple elegance of the film. It's an overview of many disciplines. If you can put your ego away and enjoy it, you will find it to be lovely. My only wish is that I would have watched it with my boyfriend because it is captivating for all viewers. Also, and perhaps this is just because of the copy I have, the film does not reach full screen. Otherwise, it was one of the best, most moving, most incredibly filmed documentaries I have seen in a long time.",1280016000,8,718,4.573643410852713
4099675,2,B003A060EC,"The IMAX Horses was probably great in the IMAX, but I wasn't that impressed as a movie played on a regular TV screen.  It was nice and all, but nothing that great, and I LOVE horses.",1278806400,4,182,4.055555555555555
4099676,5,B003A060EC,"We love horses and recommend this to all horse lovers, it was beautifully done. It will help you become a horse lover if you're not!",1390867200,,132,4.32
4099677,2,B003A060EC,"This video would probably be ok for kids under 12.  It was a bit fakey and not true to horse behavior, which is what I got it for -- to use in a college class...not effective.",1389916800,,175,3.861111111111111
4099678,5,B003A060EC,Such beautiful horses and the scenery i could not take my eyes off the screen.  Very happy i purchased this dvd!,1379635200,,112,4.333333333333333
4099679,5,B003A060EC,I loved this movie! How it shows three inspiring stories of how horses can be used in different ways. And sometimes the horses will backfire away from human plans. They are living beings like us after all.,1364169600,,205,4.5675675675675675
4099680,4,B003A060EC,"Three horses bought from a prestigious horse auction and what happens to each of them from the time they leave the ring.  Colour is good, acting is good, all in all a good DVD.  I liked it.",1361491200,,189,4.081081081081081
4099681,2,B003A060EC,"Instead of this fairybook story, I strongly suggest people see
SAVING AMERICA'S HORSES A NATION BETRAYED is an feature documentary film which explains how horses are treated in America.

4099682,3,B003A060EC,This DVD was ok. It traced the lives of three horses. I feel the young female horse lovers would enjoy this one.,1357689600,,112,4.136363636363637
4099683,5,B003A060EC,"If you love horses, you will love this DVD. I have not seen newly born horses, and this part was especially interesting to watch.",1356998400,,129,4.416666666666667
4099684,5,B003A060EC,"I wrote 5 stars for quality of picture, since the photography and videography was very good and somewhat artistic, from a realistic point of view, but I feel this movie wasn't what it was written to be.  To call this the story of Equus, is misleading because it is anything but a that.  It is a just a story written from a non horseman's point of view.  The three scenario's don't show timelines so it gives you the impression that you can do all of this as the horses are that young, plus you don't see race bred TB's just turned out to the wild and survive well.  Realistically, they would die.  It's a great movie if you have kids and want to sugar coat some things and get them interested in horses without knowing the ""ills"" of the animal, but it's dissapointing for anybody really expecting to see the ""Story of Equus"".  To say this movie was made for those truelly interested in horses and already in the industry is a sham, but for the occasional horse enthusiast, it should be a great choice.",1325548800,3,1001,4.383783783783784
4099685,5,B003A060EC,"This is a great movie for kids and adults. It shows the beauty of the horse.  The chestnut is being trained as a racehorse and is pushed quickly (too quickly) to be a winner, the black escapes to the wild and tries to find a herd to belong to and the bay does not get along with his evening owner and stops short of a ditch bank and dumps her into the water ending their relationship.  Hundreds of kids who have watched this at our summer camps love this movie and want to see it again and again.  We own every horse movie ever made and this is one of the favorites.  As a barn owner and horse trainer I give this movie two thumbs up!",1323648000,,634,4.007936507936508
