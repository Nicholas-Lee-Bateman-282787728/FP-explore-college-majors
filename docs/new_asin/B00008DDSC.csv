1836216,5,B00008DDSC,"Both characters in this first-of-it's-kind movie were well drawn.  It's a first because it shows the S/M, D/s dynamic in a sympathetic, caring, humorous way; and it's a mainstream film ... not a parody or cautionary tale.
E. Edward Grey (an excellent James Spader reminiscent of ""Sex, Lies and Videotape"") could have used a little more background but that's quibbling.  Lee's character was simply marvelous from start to finish.  In my small hometown, a few people even applauded at the end.  We've come a long way.
Love comes in all sizes, and the discovery of that love makes an engrossing 144 minutes of film time. I've heard people say these two are ""damaged.""  Really?  But aren't we all?  And how lovely and whimsical to find another who understands us so well.
Lee (Maggie Gyllenhaal) blossoms from a repressed, obsessive, unhappy girl into a self-assured woman all because a strange, obsessive, largely unhappy man sees in her the need to be .... herself ... a submissively strong woman who likes to be spanked, restrained, and ordered around.  As long as she knows her submission is understood, she is liberated in the true sense of that term.  She becomes the powerful one ... all because she accepts who she is. Acceptance and love.  Isn't that what most of us aspire to?
I loved the scene where Lee tries to do the impossible: make a cup of coffee for the new boss who casually demands it.  A truly submissive person will understand that scene on a very deep level.
I'll see this again before it leaves my local theater. And can't wait to buy the DVD when it's available.  It's a ""feel good"" movie with an irresistible twist! :)
This movie is not for everyone; but I wish I could say it was.  It deals with all the relevant themes of a good, complex love story.  It just adds a new level ---- and one that's been around in the shadows for a few decades.",1034294400,211,1865,4.578313253012048
1836217,5,B00008DDSC,"Exciting, sexy, naughty, the acting was superb!!  I would recommend this movie to any adult who is uninhibited.",1033257600,5,111,5.166666666666667
1836218,1,B00008DDSC,"I can see how some people would be impressed by this movie, but I wasn't. It moved way too slow for me and I grew annoyed instead of intrigued by the characters. There were just way too many gimmicks for me to sit through! While the rest of the theater laughed at the pathetic title character's antics, I looked at my watch. I walked out of the theater soon after watching the scene where Lee and her boyfriend was having dinner at a resturaunt that looked like an adolecent girl's jewelry store. James Spader deserves better than this.",1032912000,10,536,4.479591836734694
1836219,4,B00008DDSC,"Heard the buzz about this one weeks ago (LOVE the promotional poster). The theatre in NYC was 90% full, 2 or 3 people left in the middle of it, but not me. I like to watch the envelope get pushed.
The film seems to be an essay on ""psychologically broken"" people
finding each other and muddling thru ""normal life."" Practically
everyone on screen has had some form of emotional crippling which
keeps them isolated from everyday society. But this is far from a
""downer,"" because amidst the angst, there are subtle laughs -- the strange behavior can make you chuckle at the oddest situations...
I hate to give away too much plot, but if you enjoy movies that keep you thinking while it plays with your emotions AND challenges your ideas of acceptable behavior, give it a shot.
The acting is fascinating, with the female lead (Maggie Gyllenhaal) giving off sparks of extreme courage -- not many women would have taken on a role like this.
I loved Cronenberg's ""Crash"" because it was a psychological spinning wheel:you could never clearly predict what anyone was doing or thinking. This runs along the same lines.
Did I like it? I was in its spell, following it wherever it went,
and most importantly, I was never bored (a lot like ""Mullholland
Drive"")--so yeah, I liked it. Would I see it again & again? Probably not. Would I recommend it? Only to the adventurous -- most regular moviegoers would find this perverse/silly/pointless
or just plain ""bad."" (Believe me, it is none of those)
Throughout the film, I kept thinking ""I can't believe a movie like this came out of Hollywood !"" It's someone's dark little secret fantasy put up on a big screen for all to see, and the girl's final close-up may sum up the filmaker's message in a nutshell. ""Yeah, and what are YOU looking at....?""",1032825600,,1779,4.6687898089171975

It made me question a lot of things about the human psyche, how our minds and souls are shaped. I definitely recommend this movie.",1514160000,,353,4.53125
1836409,5,B00008DDSC,"This was a great movie. I didn't like the stereotype of men beating women that is Lees dad, and some of the side plots fun & quirky but not realistic.  Good because it landed humor to the movie. However, the real meat of the movie- the relationship between the secretary and the attorney was real. The tension was real the dominant and submissive was real, and the sub you can see was trying to control the relationship- because as in real dom/sub relationships they like it. The quirky side like family members talking to her, dull bf, cutting apparatus... made the movie fun.
And fifty shades of grey ripped this off and made it much worse- yet made more $.",1514073600,,659,4.491666666666666

1836447,5,B00008DDSC,"One of my All Time favorite BDSM themed movies! Quirky and the concept is on point. The bare handed spanking scene is GREAT! And when (the original) Mr Grey carries Lee Holloway upstairs to bathe her, it always takes my breath away. The complete soundtrack is outstanding!",1508630400,,272,4.808510638297872
1836448,5,B00008DDSC,"I remember seeing this years ago when it came out.  I hadn't seen it since until I rented it.  I love this movie.  My boyfriend had never seen it, so I was excited about him watching this with me.  Such a great movie",1508457600,,216,3.953488372093023
1836449,5,B00008DDSC,"I have to review this after reading other reviews.  I thought this movie was very well done.  I certainly don't think it will appeal to everyone, but those that it does, it speaks. *spoilers ahead*  I don't really think that it's accurate to comment on this as BDSM - just finished reading one review who says that you have to suspend a lot of disbelief about Lee's inexperience and Mr. Grey's involvement with her b/c no Dom would ever involve themselves with someone with no experience.  I'm no expert, but I have to disagree.  I never got the impression that he considered himself a Dom, and was entering into contracts or agreements with submissives.  I thought it was more realistic in the fact that, you know, I think we all have things that are a little weird about us, especially when it comes to sexual quirks, and we don't always understand them, and many of us spend our entire lives fighting them and thinking we're strange or wrong.  Not to mention we don't start out as experts.  There are going to be experiences that lead us to these discoveries, and it will take time before fully understanding them.  So I took this plot as Mr. Grey trying to repress this side of himself, he punished himself for it, and self-loathing was eating him up, but of course he's only human and gives in to the temptation.  Lee, obviously, was totally new to it, so it was very clear that on her side it was about discovery.  So I didn't suspend any disbelief, this is kind of exactly the way I would imagine that people with these types of tastes discover them. Of course, it's a movie, so I suppose the suspended disbelief might be on the happy ending, but still, in my mind, this was more realistic than a typical movie.  Excellent work, from all sides.  The sexual tension was very well done, and while at times the scenes were a bit bizarre, it just added to the appeal.",1506729600,8,1870,4.480825958702065
1836478,5,B00008DDSC,The writing was fabulous and James Spader knocked it out of the park.  These actors made me feel that this was real. And of course the music was brilliant.,1506211200,,155,4.344827586206897

You can see the internal struggle the main characters had: Mr. Grey with the need to control things on his terms in his own way and trying to cope with his twisted thoughts/behavior towards just about every aspect of his life; and Lee needing to escape the struggles of her family and the pain she feels from everything she's unable to fix herself.

1836541,4,B00008DDSC,"Can a masochist find true happiness?  Apparently so, if she finds just the right sadist.  Maggie Gyllenhaal is terrific, but she was a bit too plotting for a submissive personality and, ultimately, at a critical moment does something out of character.  Spader clearly has the upper hand.  He has insight into what Gyllenhaal thinks and craves, but he is almost too remorseful to sustain the relationship.  In short, the principal characters are probably not representative of real sado-masochists.  They are too functional for that.  Still, the movie makes an effective plea for diversity.  If I had known what it was about, I would probably not have watched it.  However, it is very entertaining, offbeat love story.",1497916800,,717,5.112068965517241

In ""Fifty Shades of Gray,"" the dominant's name is also Mr. Gray.
They didn't even bother to change the guy's name.

Anyway, ""Secretary"" came first - - it was the original story.
I loved it.
I thought that Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader were cast perfectly.
There was a lot of chemistry between them.

That makes it seem like she traded in one mental problem for a different one, BDSM, which is not classified as such. I thought Maggie was superb in this film, & James Spader played his role as a tightly wound lawyer to the hilt, & I'm glad it ended as it did. (But I won't spoil it, if you haven't seen it.)

Most of the time it seems when people look at/read/hear about relationships like the one my Master and I share all they see is the 'scary' aspects, but this movie highlights that M/s is so much more than sadomasochistic sex (or any other fear-mongering stereotype). Our relationship is based on love, connection, and clarity of expectations. The submissive in this movie learns to anticipate the needs of the Dominant, and modifies her behavior to please both of them (though she still occasionally engages in the game of ""Poke the Sadist"". All in mutual fun though). The Dominant recognizes the needs of the submissive and sets clear boundaries and protocols to be followed that are mutually beneficial. Their relationship is built on love, respect. and ""the little things"" - just like any other healthy relationship. It's great to see that highlighted mainstream.

1838222,4,B00008DDSC,"Hi, being a submissive I was expecting a little bit more in my opinion but overall it was a good movie.  I did not realize it was a comedy and it pleasantly surprised me.  I did like the movie but it only depicts a potential example of a D/s sexual relationship. For instance, my Dom and I do not utilize physical discipline for the very reason depicted in the movie. Since I am a masochist, impact play (eg: spanking) is a motivator for disobedience not a deterrent within our dynamic. In other D/s relationship dynamics, this may not be the case though. The majority of Doms want a Power Exchange not a power struggle. Most Doms know Themselves before accepting a submissive. IMO, it is highly irresponsible if not dangerous for a Dom not to know Him/Herself beforehand. They need to know They can control Themselves before controlling someone else.. Mr. Grey did not know Himself and the movie depicts that a Dom not knowing Himself can be harmful to the sub. Of course, by the end He discovered Himself so it was a happy ending. What I LOVED about Maggie was that she found herself in her submission and it was freeing<===This is accurate for a percentage of subs---a feeling of completeness.  D/s is a very personal journey of self discovery and living your life being true to yourself.  Every D/s dynamic is unique because each person in the dynamic has their own personality, limits, needs and kinks. So, depicting accurate BDSM would be difficult in a film because it is so varied and vast. BTW, some  D/s relationships do not even include sex within their dynamic. What I did not like was the portrayal of the characters being mentally ill (stereo-type of BDSM). In the real world, people into BDSM come from every walk of life and socio-economic background including people who may have physical or mental illnesses or who are perfectly healthy and sane.  What I also love-LOVED was that Maggie RESEARCHED and READ all she could on BDSM.....she educated herself.  Becoming knowledgeable of BDSM is very important in order to understand various types of kink, limits, power exchange and most importantly the SAFETY aspect.  I give the movie a grade of B.  For me, the Submission of Emma Marx trilogy is a more realistic depiction of a D/s relationship especially since she uses her safe word during a scene.",1477353600,,2316,4.727047146401985

1838325,5,B00008DDSC,"One of those rare gems of film making. Take a taboo subject play it as human comedy and you shed some light on the human condition. Now, there is no political movement promoting that SMBD is the sexual freedom we have all been missing and should immediately embrace like lesbianism and homosexuality. It seems that the social engineers of the past eight years have over looked SM & BD as lifestyles for everyone. Give them time and I expect that the political correct crowd will be pushing our noses in it.
However, in the meantime someone made a movie, a very good movie; a movie made damn near perfect for the talents of James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal. Its got pathos and bathos, which makes it watchable for those who have no prurient interest in the subject.
BTY, human comedy is about common people who through the course of the play or movie overcome certain life problems to the improvement of their lives. Hence, that is the basic message of the movie.",1477094400,5,964,4.6104651162790695

Some of the scenes were sort of slow and drawn out with seemingly no intent of portraying anything thought provoking.  It is as if the director just wanted to waste some time.  But.  On the other hand.  I relate to the female characters form of self abuse in the beginning, and some of the dialogue explaining reasoning behind it was to me, psychologically very correct.

It was fun to see the younger(with hair) Spader in a role that had tones of the Blacklist. Not a lot of plot more about character personalities that somehow no matter how flawed find comfort with each other. Not that compelling of a movie but ok.

But I still really enjoyed the character dynamics of Maggie and James, I think they both are troubled people finding a way to cope thru their demons.

There is a lot of unspoken content one must understand to really enjoy this film, and it certainly won't appeal to everyone. I must say that from the promotional art to the story-line - ""Fifty Shades of Gray"" seems to have ripped off this film (book/screenplay), except that ""Fifty Shades"" is a very inferior product.

This film explains (without a lot of words) the budding desires of a sexual-submissive, and a self loathing dominant/control freak. While some will find the proclivities offensive others will find it a masterpiece of story-telling with difficult subject matter.",1475625600,56,700,4.932203389830509

Having said that, the overall mood of the movie is that there is a need to explain the psychology of this fascination and that it is not quite normal among consenting adults.  That is psychologically incorrect. However, once the two main characters found each other and understood each other a bit, they certainly could not have cared less about why, but only let's do!",1441152000,,391,4.75
1839136,4,B00008DDSC,"Warning! Spoilers!! Awkwardly erotic. Oddly fun.

Does a great job at demonstrating how the main character could plausibly get from A to Z as the story demands, but the film promises a lot more than it delivers. The gratuitous nudity at the end should have happened far earlier and both genders should have been involved not just Gyllenhaal. The fact that it's all too traditional in that sense is a sad commentary on our American fear of, and immaturity with our sexuality in this society. And Spader is far too good-looking--to be the one seen only shirtless for 2-seconds at the end of the film, while Gyllenhaal gets viewed in full frontal. There are 2 genders in the world dear filmmakers, and the female of the species makes up the larger of those halves (we are 51%). Fans of BDSM will note that this is arguably the original material upon which 50 Shades was based, and is actually much better, and more palatable, in reaching its goals than the Shades books or movies. Given the age of Gyllenhaal's character and her sexual inexperience, this storyline is a more plausible set up, but still quite a huge stretch. Why? Because most Doms in the Lifestyle (Spader's character isn't and doesn't claim to be throughout 90% of the movie) would never enter into a dom/sub arrangement of any kind with someone who is sexually inexperienced. That's dangerous, and it's courting legal trouble, as well. Doesn't happen in the real world. So expect to suspend a great deal of your disbelief if you watch this. I'm reviewing this with an eye to some what viewer expectation will be here because of the increased mainstream interest and acceptance of BDSM since Shades. Performances by both actors are outstanding. The movie certainly has some lighter moments in it that make the content of their mutual character's psychological and emotional troubles easier to see, understand, and think about within the context of our fairly rigid social culture, where our expectations are shackled with overtones of religious extremism in the mainstream. The downside to this movie is that it could have been a MUCH sexier film without needing to go any further with clothing removal than it did (hardly any as it is), but it does suffer from the scrutiny of the time period and cultural expectations of our society. Highly recommended movie! (Disclaimer: I'm naturally biased toward freedom of expression, freedom of speech (including sexuality) I'm also looking at this movie not just as a former filmmaker, but also from the perspective of its impact upon us culturally and socially, and what it does to advance (or diminish) sexual expression as a valid form of communication. This advances at least the dialogue about sexuality and pain, if not the expression, but other films are needed to become part of the mainstream for us to reach advancement of expression around sexuality. Ultimately every movie or book or painting is a piece of art and the viewers reaction says more about them and their state of being than about the art itself. Without the art however, we have nothing but blank slate, and it's hard to have a dialogue of any kind without the art. Worth the almost 2 hours of your time.",1441065600,,3187,4.847706422018349

Irrespective of that, the way this story is unfolded is unusual and unsettling. When we are first introduced to the Maggie character she is suffering from a terrible family situation. Her father is mentally ill and an alcoholic, and this--we are led to believe--is the cause of wounds she is intentionally inflicting on herself. Our sympathies are enlisted for Spader's tyrannical attorney specifically because he cares about Maggie and wants her to stop hurting herself. There is a turning point when Maggie drops her kit of knives and scissors into the river, signaling that she is cured of this sickness, thanks to Spader. She becomes so enamored with Spader's tyranny, however, that she starts inflicting more pain on herself, paddling her rear with a hairbrush in private and fantasizing that he is inflicting other painful punishments. By the end of the story, once the two have married, she's showing him all the scars from the wounds she gave herself before meeting him--with pride and joy. What? Should we revisit the impressions we formed during the first hour of the film and disconnect Maggie's self-abuse from her father? When she tossed the knives and scissors away--was that not really a turning point? Does she still need to feel pain, for reasons that have nothing to do with her father? Or are we supposed to see that the desire for pain, which was initially pathological, has now been turned into something wonderful because it's associated with love? The story strategy is much more devious than it at first appears. And the layers of dark humor and sentimentality further complicate our emotional reactions. A very interesting movie.

The movie and its characters are eccentric, and there is a bit of the fantastic mixed with the realism.  A sort of S/M romantic comedy fairy tale.  Has a few scenes that are of an appealingly sexual nature, without being at all graphic, and certainly not pornographic.  There are also a few scenes that are mildly disturbing (and which could likely be even more disturbing for some viewers) involving cutting and which are ambiguously S/M or abuse.",1435622400,,606,4.96039603960396

1839212,5,B00008DDSC,"This is a great film. You might not like it if - You need to see yourself as the hero or heroine the story. You will probably love it if - You like expertly crafted stories, superb acting (Spader and Gyllenhaal are amazing), and can appreciate a love story without projecting yourself into it. E. Edward Grey (James Spader) and Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal) are flawed characters. The beauty of their love story (like all love stories) is that they understand each other and quite naturally fulfill each others needs. It is a BDSM story however you don't have to be into BDSM to love it. By the time the first spanking scene happens you're probably going to be relieved, maybe even grateful that Mr. Grey is spanking Lee  because you're going to know its exactly what she needs  and that hes doing it for her (really). It just so happens that Mr. Greys relationship with Lee is what he needs too.

About the comparisons to 50 Shades of Grey. If youve read the Twilight books and watched Secretary you're going to find lots of similarities.",1433116800,,1042,4.591397849462366

I rented it after reading about it as part of someone's review of 50 Shades of Grey. The reviewer compared the two movies and  said he didn't  understand why everyone was  making  such a big deal about 50 and its contents  when ""Secretary"" had  been made years ago and was far worse. Well, I do have to admit that the statement was  true: ""Secretary"" is WAY worse. But not for the reasons everyone is thinking. There is no nudity until the last  scene ans then only briefly. T here  no love story, no bdsm, not really a good storyline at all. NOTHING even close to 50 Shades. It is about a goofy girl with low self esteem who works for a lawyer who spanks her for typing errors. It was boring and moronic. If I could have stopped watching and received a refund, I would have.

1839286,5,B00008DDSC,"I know everyone probably says ""this is so much better than Fifty Shades of Grey,"" but it is. Yes, there are some misconceptions and stereotypes, and it's probably not the kind of perfect example of safety or whatever, but Harry Potter doesn't wear a helmet when he rides a hippogriff, either.

It's a great story. You learn to love the characters--both Lee and Mr. Grey. You cheer them on and want them to get together. And I think the best part is that it conveys the appeal in this kind of relationship and this kind of sexuality. You don't have to personally enjoy it for yourself in order to understand that they are both having a good time. I won't wreck the details for you, but she doesn't have to make him be a kind-hearted person: it's clear that he's that all along. And by the end, this ""submissive"" woman has never been stronger in her life.

Just watch it and enjoy it, because you will.",1428710400,,900,4.4156626506024095

It's very nice to see a good happy ending, even if it's a painfully, blissfully, happy one!  You don't have to be raunchy and explicit to get the point across.

Both of the main actors do a great job in their roles and the kinkier scenes are just as good or even better than 50 Shades of Grey (which by the way rips off much of the plot from this movie). I highly recommend this movie as it's worth an hour and half of your life and at least 5 bucks.,1424217600,2,363,3.918918918918919

1839513,2,B00008DDSC,"I have seen recommendations for this movie all over the internet. I'm suspecting it's because of the release of 50 Shades. A lot of people are recommending you watch The Secretary instead. Even friends on my Facebook feed are posting this movie! So I had pretty high expectations for a ""quirky"" love story and was sadly let down. I was really confused for the first 30 minutes or so. I thought what I was watching was a comical parody instead of a love story. I thought ""Maybe I read the reviews wrong."" So I pushed through only to realize that no, the acting and plot were just that bad. James Spader's character was so awkward it made me squirm. I was expecting fun, giggly awkward, not cringe behind the pillow awkward. Then there's Maggie's character that walks around with the look of a kicked puppy for half the film until her boss decides to spank her without even asking her if that's alright. I didn't find a sweet love story, I found a girl with little life experience and emotional issues that is taken advantage of by her weirdo boss. She likes it though so I guess that makes it ok.",1423872000,,1095,4.45273631840796

1839534,5,B00008DDSC,"With the impending release of Fifty Shades of Grey, it will inevitably follow that comparisons will be made to Secretary, which appears to have been the first ""mainsteam"" film with its central  characters being B/D/S/M oriented. Hopefully it will result in more people ""finding"" this little gem, and I think it will be appreciated anew. Fifty Shades delves further into the background of its Mr. Grey (at least in the books-- it remains to be seen how much can be covered in a standard-length film), and clearly there will be far more attention paid to the intimate encounters, but Secretary keeps the dynamics of the relationship squarely as the central focus (and rather than a reluctant/ambivalent submissive a.k.a. Ana, Lee Holloway actually winds up ""pursuing"" HER Mr. Grey. When I first read Fifty Shades my first thought was how it just couldn't be coincidence -- another Mr. Grey?

1839603,5,B00008DDSC,"This is a pretty creepy movie in a lot of ways, but it really does show a bit of the dom/sub relationship. James Spader turns in one of his best performances as Mr. Gray, the dominant boss who wants to completely subordinate the one woman in his life, his secretary. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Lee turns from a mousy girl who has been so bored with her life that she has attempted suicide and continues to cut herself. Mr. Gray teaches her to feel in ways she never imagined.

This may open up eyes for some people into what a dom/sub relationship can entail or even some things not to do. For example, Mr. Gray sometimes has to be coaxed into administering discipline by an event that makes him angry. That is a really bad idea in the S&M world as safety of the parties involved should be paramount.",1416528000,,794,4.364864864864865

1839688,1,B00008DDSC,"Secretary belongs in the category called horses for courses.  Some people like the kink and the S&M, but I am not a fan.  I generally found this so called romantic comedy too sadistic to even begin to comprehend where is the romance and where is the comedy.  Frankly, if I did not know better, I would have thought the Marquis de Sade wrote this darn film.  How is it romantic for an employer to cane his secretary?  For that matter of fact, which secretary would actually go out looking for way to have her employer do simulated sex on her doggy style.  Of course, this movie has its defenders who enjoy the kink and the S&M.  Like I said, horses for courses.  My idea of a romantic comedy is The American President or My Best Friend's Wedding.  Anyone expecting a decent straight up erotic film would be better off with Eyes Wide Shut.  Anyone wishing to check out Maggie Gyllenhaal in her birthday suit would be much better off getting watching on HBO's Stripsearch.  That is a film in which viewers are treated to a close up of full manual body cavity search of Maggie Gyllenhaal and every last asset that Maggie Gyllenhaal has without the film getting a NC-17 rating.",1410220800,4,1172,4.507109004739337

Dealing with the dynamics of the dominant/submissive relationship, it is compelling, thought provoking and perhaps mind-broadening. Is it possible to have a unique type of power and satisfaction in the submissive role in a relationship? Maybe. In any event, both actors, Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader, were great. For some inexplicable reason, even though I have not been in a romantic relationship for 20 years, and don't plan to be anytime soon (maybe in my next life), I still felt a strange sense of liberation, a broadened awareness and understanding, after watching this.

(NOT because of the things that take place there), but because of the familiarity of the office space and the job.

1839811,5,B00008DDSC,"This film does something no other film dealing with this subject matter has: made it safe and accessible, instead of scary or parodistic.  Instead of making it a grand spectacle, the film does a good job of creating interesting characters you care about first, THEN creates an intriguing world where their behavior and relationship is meaningful.  It shows the complexities of such a relationship: although Gyllenhaal's character is clearly submissive, she still finds ways to exert control.  And while Spader's character is an obsessive control freak, he displays compassion and care, while dealing with the internal loss of control that comes with falling in love.",1388620800,2,666,5.3238095238095235

1839831,5,B00008DDSC,"I've had this movie sitting around for months, but the mixed reviews I'd read kept me from getting around to watching it. Last night, my boyfriend was going through my movies and asked me what it was about. All I could remember from the description were ""BDSM"" and ""Maggie Gyllenhaal"", but that was enough for us to give it a  shot. We started watching, very aware that it might turn out to be weird rather than honest. We were both pleasantly surprised.
James Spader is fantastic, giving a performance with as much reactionary face contorting as Tim Roth in Four Rooms but without the camp. You can tell that this was based on a short story because it feels like the world in which it takes place is in a pocket universe, where even interactions with the real world focus almost entirely around the two main characters.
Maggie Gyllenhaal's performance is equally amazing, completely transforming her into Lee. My one problem with her performance is that all throughout the movie I wanted to tell her to stand up straight, but that's just because her shy slouch looks painful.
Almost every scene is powerfully raw and honest, thanks in large part to Spader's full immersion into his character. When he's talking with Gyllenhaal, you can't look away- but it's when no one can see him but the camera that his performance really shines. It's obvious that his character knows exactly HOW to be dominant in exactly the way she needs him to be, but when he's alone he has so much trouble with WHY and this is written clearly on his face.
The BDSM is light, and hinted (especially in a hilarious montage in the middle of the movie) more than shown, but it doesn't seem that the director was shying away from it- more like they're just showing you what is necessary to tell the story.
That brings me to the director. He managed to squeeze more talent, more emotion out of every scene than I thought possible. It's been ten years since this came out and I have never heard his name before, but I think I should have by now. He's clearly fantastic.
My only problem with the movie is that in the first scene in the office, one of the three steadycam operators sort of failed at keeping the camera steady.
All in all, this has got to be one of my favourite movies of all time.",1384819200,,2264,4.521951219512195

Pay attention to the use of color. It's not as apparent as how Tim Burton does things, but it's there and adds a lot to the story.",1381622400,,343,4.276923076923077

The alternative path  in this particular style was based totally on the trust necessary for every individual who allows another to possess their body and soul to the unbound limits of joy....which is shared by both. I guess it is like the saying ""Beauty is in the eye of the beholder""  Mr. Spader and Ms Gilynhall  were exceptional in their roles. the setting was perfect and the supporting actors were  on spot. what an awesome way to tell  a story of alternative Love. It was great",1381017600,,554,4.5
1839845,5,B00008DDSC,I absolutely love this movie. The idea of a D/s relationship being in a movie was never attractive to me because I thought it would be portrayed terribly but not in this at all. James Spader is Mr. Grey to me and he'll always be the original.,1380931200,,242,4.170212765957447

1839866,5,B00008DDSC,Fantastic movie. Incredibly courageous roles. Depicting a neurotic slice of life that most people are unaware of--self-harm and sadism in a very sensitive way with great performances by the main characters. The resolution is beautiful.

Knowing you are trying to introduce someone with so many issues into the lifestyle he wasn't as sensitive to that as I would of liked to see. The dominant as predator and submissive as victim is not something that should be shown as the truth of the lifestyle.

This film does a wonderful job of walking the fine line between satire and psychological thriller. These are not two people playing with a spanking or two, far from it. She has a history of serious problems with cutting, among other things, and is the last person who should be playing with the submissive role to a strange lawyer who has a penchant for domination (this is not play, folks). The sense of danger is palpable in every frame, and you are never sure if and when this dangerous liason will spiral out of control into something far more dangerous, even life threatening. Maggie Gyllenhall is absolutely perfect as the secretary who gets what she needs, and perhaps more, balanced on the edge of a precipice that could lead to madness. James Spader plays this as well as Nicholson did with ""The Shining""...the comparison will be clear when you se the film. I could not take my eyes off the screen as the spring tightened, and I suspect you will feel the same. Be clear, though, that this is not a play ful romp, far from it.

1839966,4,B00008DDSC,"Maggie Gyllenhaal exploded onto the scene in the early aughts, and it was her devilishly stunning turn in the kinky office drama `Secretary' that got her the bulk of her acclaim and spearheaded her to the front of the pack as far as talented young stars were concerned.  I'm still completely floored by the way she crafts such a complex character and still manages to make her feel so simple.

The film is adapted from the short story by Mary Gaitskill.  It tells the story of a young woman named Lee who is from a very defunct family and certainly suffers because of it.  On the outset of the film she is being released from institutional therapy and takes a job as a secretary for a lawyer named Mr. Grey.  Almost immediately, their relationship turns toward S&M.  Both parties are obviously compliant with the idea and looking for the opportunity, and so when it presents itself they take full advantage.  The relationship seems to have nowhere to go but downhill, but `Secretary' takes a surprising turn in direction as it defies logic and creates a home for these emotionally crippled individuals.

Spader is wonderful, truly embracing his dominant quality (and the comparisons to `sex, lies and videotape' are warranted) but it is Gyllenhaal who completely owns this film.  The way she filters through all the stages of her character's growth is flawless, and the way she communicates such yearning with her eyes (and the way she `takes it') is just marvelously rendered with great finesse.  She conveys emotions that hit hard and help to add depth to the subject at hand.  That is another thing that is so commendable about `Secretary' is that it never appears to prod or poke fun or dismiss this `situation' as a mere gag or gimmick, but it is always presented in a realistic and accessible way.  This film is far from judgmental, and while the ending can and probably should be seen as a fantastical representation of a day-dream, it is constructed in a way that feels authentic and `appropriate'.

I'll echo the sentiments regarding the non-existent backstory for Mr. Grey.  It would have really been nice to add some depth or color to his character.  Lee's character is broken down for us in many ways, either obviously or within Gyllenhaal's presentation, but Mr. Grey is ambiguous to the point where it feels like a plot hole almost.  Alas, this is still a smart and witty look at a serious situation and it sports one of the best breakthrough performances of the aughts.

The comparisons to that `Fifty Shades of Grey' trash is beyond me.",1344297600,2,2552,4.750566893424036

I won't spoil it, but they would have been better served to use the opening as the ending to provide some closure.

The acting is very good. She comes across a bit schizo, which she is. He comes across as the tough guy, but it's all a veneer. While her acting has a subtle quality, his is way over the top, especially towards the end.

All in all, the plot holds together. The characters are attractive. There is some humor. Like when she's overcome with lust and goes into the ladies room to masturbate not knowing one of the stalls is occupied. Oops!

All in all this is a lighthearted serious/comedy. The hardcore BDSM types will be disappointed and the vanilla types will be scratching their heads. If they'd put the opening sequence at the end it might have been 5 stars.

I loved this film enough to buy it on DVD which I so very rarely do.  I've only purchased 3 or 4 movies in my entire life.  This was the best of them.
The movie depicts a young woman, Lee, who self-mutilates and ends up in a mental hospital.  Upon release she is far from cured because no one has understood that her proclivity for self-mutilation is really a cry for love not help.  The love that she is seeking is not the vanilla love that a strange friend (Peter) offers her.  Lee needs to be understood and in order to do that she has to meet someone who realizes that Lee really wants a BDSM relationship where she can play out her submissive desires for discipline and, when needed, punishment.  Under the over watchful eye of attorney E. Edward Grey, Lee finds her mentor and eventually her Dominant lover.
It seems that neither Lee nor Edward really understands their own BDSM needs but as the story unfolds, they come to understand what they each lack and what the other can supply.  When Edward fires Lee, we see that he does not really understand his own insecurity.  Far from being a self-assured Dominant, Edward is not really sure how he feels about himself or about Lee.  Lee, on the other hand, hesitates for as long as it takes to don a wedding gown, and then has a moment of clarity.
She runs out of the gown fitting knowing what and who she wants.  Peter who has proposed marriage would be a ho hum lover and husband sending Lee right back to the sharp edges and cutting herself anew.  She knows that she wants and needs Edward and proceeds to run directly into his office and plants herself in his desk chair until he understands how much she loves him and how much he loves her.  It takes him three days of Lee not leaving the desk chair even to urinate.
In the end, Edward sees what Lee has discovered.  They are made for each other.  They may not be perfect but they are perfect for each other.

1839979,4,B00008DDSC,"This has always been one of my favorite movies.  It gets mixed reviews, from the critics and from viewers and buyers.  It was ahead of its time just for shining a flashlight on some taboo topics.  People looking for typical Hollywood glitz and glamour or eye-popping special effects will be disappointed.  People looking for a sweaty, leather-clad S&M film with some dialogue thrown in just to help it pass as a movie...those people will be disappointed.  People looking for a movie that's different in its honesty and humanity will appreciate it.  It's a love story that skips all the drippy sweet gorgeous-guy-meets-perfect-girl; they don't immediately fall madly in fairy tale love and run off amid a shower of bird seed and ribbons to begin their perfect vanilla life together.  They don't engage in goofy, tripped-and-fell-into-my-dream-date sitcom antics that saturate your average romantic comedy.  Their mutual ""interest"" doesn't turn into a seedy, uncomfortable B-movie.  The film does a great job of casting off the entire dark image, and the sleazy stereotypes, and just telling a story about two people trying really hard to feel normal.  It's a lot less about sex, and a lot more about people just trying to be okay.  Under the sexual surface, it actually broaches some deep subjects shrouded in enough light humor that the realness doesn't weigh you down.

I've seen people characterize Spader's performance as ""deadpan,"" ""flat"" and ""emotionless,"" and criticize the movie for being slow and boring.  The man is playing an attorney, at work, in his law firm. Spader gives a great performance as a man torn between what he feels and what's acceptable. His ""flat"" affect is his character's forced act that he's just an average guy having an average day at the office. He's trying to appear professional, aloof, and disinterested--deadpan and emotionless--like he's supposed to.  Maggie's character is equally trying to her best to be accepted and convince the world she's normal--not just some nut job fresh out of the psych ward.  I've seen people rail against this portrayal of a creepy pervert taking advantage of a young psych patient, but that's not what happens here.  The point is she's not crazy--and neither is he.  They each have their own way of dealing, coping, and feeling, just like everyone else.  She watched daddy drink and mom get slapped around, and she coped by cutting.  Her dad's way of dealing-by-drinking is no better, and certainly not healthy, but since it's also not wierd or morbid it's accepted.  Of course it's not okay for Lee to cut herself, or for Mr. Grey to spank total strangers for making typos--suppressed feelings almost always manifest themselves in inappropriate behaviors. Once these two find each other, and start expressing instead of supressing themselves as part of a consensual adult relationship, the inappropriate coping mechanisms stop and they finally become the ""normal"" people they've been pretending to be all along. He goes to the office like an average guy, she settles into being the average housewife, and they do their thing at home where it's completely appropriate.  No more cutting, no more changing secretaries like underwear...they're healthy, they're happy, and they didn't even need rehab.  Once he can stop pretending, Spader's ""flat, deadpan"" persona gives way to feeling and passion--even tenderness-- but thankfully without the sappy, mushy, ""romance"" typical of most love stories. This movie is deeper than a ""dark comedy,"" and way more relatable than a fairy-tale romance.  It's truer and cleaner than the S&M flick some people were hoping for.  If you're looking for a B&D guy movie, you'll have to look elsewhere.  If you're looking for the usual hearts-and-flowers chick-flick, this isn't it. If you want a break from the ordinary and a love story that's not so sweet it hurts your teeth, this delivers. It's not a film for everyone, but people who don't enjoy the lifestyle can still enjoy the movie and may even end up getting ideas.",1337644800,7,4021,5.083713850837139

It never falls prey to stereotype of pre-prescribed ideas of what those things are and often seems to be exploring them for the first time.  What a breath of fresh air.  I loved this movie. Dynomite performances by Spader (who's still got that tweaked charm) and Maggie Gyllenhaal, who's very moving and very likable.  Finally though this movie's got a sense of humor under all the rage of desire on a low boil.  It's almost a dark comedy, if not for the fact that it touches on some very real issues of the heart.

This Lionsgate Indie is actually a very clever satire about two tweaked people, one a lawyer and the other a troubled woman who comes to work at his law office. Their obsessive interaction is daring, super charged and mind bendingly erotic. It pushes all those primal buttons to the floor and beyond.

1840004,5,B00008DDSC,"It's too bad that Amazon allows ratings only up to 5 stars. I would give ""Secretary"" at least 7 stars. It has easily become my all-time favorite movie.

The principal characters are Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and E. Edward Grey (James Spader).  Lee is a young woman who cuts herself when stressed.  Mr. Grey is her employer, an obsessive-compulsive, with a seemingly mean streak which masks his attraction to Lee.  As the plot unfolds their relationship evolves, to put it mildly.

The theme of Secretary is dominance/submission, and there are scenes of spanking, self-stimulation, and some nudity. Fair warning to any yahoos out there who think that women should be kept barefoot and pregnant, and slapped around: you'll find this movie disappointing  -- spend your money on a six-pack instead.

Fair advice also to any feminists out there who might pre-judge that ""Secretary"" serves only to gratify the aforementioned yahoos: I would urge you to see this movie and judge for yourself. You'll need to keep an open mind as you watch, but if you can suspend judgment you may see a beautiful love story about two wounded people finding one another.

I won't say much here about the plot, which I found highly erotic despite the often light-hearted tone of the movie. The most intensely erotic scene, for me, was the one labeled ""Insight"" on the scene selection menu. Erotic? Lee and Mr. Grey merely talk, they keep their clothes on, and don't even touch one another, although they sit just a bit too close and make a bit too much eye contact. The essential action of this scene is that Mr. Grey, having discovered that Lee cuts herself when stressed, persuades her to stop. Well, actually, he commands her to stop. Lee's emotions flash through timidity, apprehension, eagerness, shyness, subtle flirtatiousness, self-deprecating humor, acquiescence, insight, resoluteness, and growing respect for both herself and Mr. Grey. The sexual tension in this scene is palpable, and when it ends one senses that the fireworks are about to begin. Ms. Gyllenhaal's performance here (and indeed through the entire movie) is pitch-perfect. She manages to convey Lee's feelings with subtleties of voice, eyes, mouth, hands, head tilt, posture, breathing, the lump in her throat, you name it. Gyllenhaal effortlessly manages to look comedic, optimistic in spite of her problem, cute, or drop-dead gorgeous, whatever the moment calls for. It's magic; in my opinion, the only other actress who comes close to Gyllenhaal's skills is Helen Mirren.

James Spader, whose role calls for great subtlety, is also perfect as Mr. Grey, as are the entire cast of supporting characters. Kudos also to Steven Shainberg for his vision and courage to create this film, and to Erin Cressida Wilson for the screen play adaptation of a short story by Mary Gaitskill. Although I don't usually pay attention to production details, I was greatly impressed by the camera work and editing. I also thought the music, especially the song ""Chariots Rise"" by Lizzie West, was great.

But it's Gyllenhaal who really owns this movie. After seeing Secretary, I wondered if perhaps she was a ""one-trick pony,"" that is, great at playing only one particular type of character. So, I bought another feature film of hers, ""Sherrybaby,"" in which she plays Sherry Swanson, a vulnerable but hard-bitten ex-con heroin addict with a quick temper and a habit of using sex to buy favors. Sherrybaby is a pretty gritty movie, but well worth seeing, and I would urge others to buy or rent it. If one didn't notice a facial resemblance, one might not realize that the same actress played both Lee Holloway and Sherry Swanson. Several professional critics opined that she deserved an Oscar nomination for that role.  Laughably, Gyllenhaal did finally get an Oscar nomination for her supporting role in Crazy Heart; she was of course very good in that movie, but her role simply didn't require great acting skills. Maybe some day Gyllenhaal will get the recognition she deserves.

One final note about the theme of Secretary: At least one other reviewer here commented that, although it was plausible for Lee Holloway to become a submissive, there was no explanation of why Mr. Grey became a dominant. I was also bothered by this at first, but then I concluded that because this movie was told from Lee's viewpoint, any background about Mr. Grey would have been a distraction. At first Mr. Grey seems like a domineering jerk, but as the movie unfolds we slowly discover that he, like Lee, is also a profoundly troubled soul. His empathy for Lee (albeit well disguised!) suggests that beneath his bluster he is also a submissive at heart, and that he gets satisfaction vicariously from his role as a dominant. This makes some sense, in accordance with the notion that in a successful dominant/submissive relationship, it is the submissive who is really in charge. I would refer you to the very final scene in Secretary.",1311206400,,4959,4.983071342200725

It's about a sheltered young woman released from a psychiatric institution, who seems repelled by the hypocrisy of her middle class environment. Her parents fight with verbal violence. She masks her emotional pain with the self-inflicted physical alternative; cutting herself but first seen with a scalding kettle being rested against her inner thigh. There was a flicker of a smile; perhaps that of self discovery. This motivates her to enter the world of adult work. She interviews for a job as a secretary. The interview is stilted. It's as if he has Aspergers syndrome; a sort of communication deficiency. ""You are over-qualified. You'll be bored to death"" he says. ""I want to be bored... I like dull work"" she retorts. There is a strong love of her father; his anguish triggering more cutting of herself. Yet all this is background to the main story; the unfolding relationship between her and her lawyer employer. This is a journey of emotional exploration with deviant sex as its embodiment. Love triumphs in an unexpected way.",1306454400,,1205,5.03
1840008,5,B00008DDSC,"""The Secretary"" is an S&M story-book drama, destined to become a cult classic -  a ""coming out"" story of S&M in one's fantasy life, and as acted out in the world. It raises the issues of love, sex and the nature of pleasure, very graphically. The acting by James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal is superb, and the photography as well. The sound track of ""relevant"" popular songs accompany the dialogue and is well presented, too. Spader's role  is somewhat overdrawn, and is obviously written into the script, because he is such a fine actor. It contrasts beautifully with Gyllenhaal's ""understated"" persona. Seeing the scene played out in a luxurious law office lends the perfect bizarre quality to the theme of what lurks behind the appearance of normalcy, and perfection.

 Whether the main characters can keep their activity in bounds is the theme of the movie. A sub-theme is whether this ""play"" could be sustained indefinitely. Can the James Spader character keep his law practice intact and thriving, and can both characters achieve a relationship that sustains rather than destroys them? Answering these questions require the viewer to explore their own attitudes toward sex, love and pleasure and pain.

  The film also raise the issue of free will vs. compulsion in this very graphical way, and the issue of whether and how people can evolve in ""healthy"" ways. What constitutes ""healthy"" attitudes toward living and sexuality activity? If we say ""healthy"" is life-affirming and ""unhealthy"" is what is not, that's just begging the question. Such an answer puts labels on the issues of people's attitudes and behaviors toward themselves and others, given each person's inclinations.

I've never seen a movie with so little dialogue b/c it's not even needed--Spader and Gyllenhall's eyes, the very rare contact between them--says so much. There's this one scene where you can literally see Spader's character pull into himself and there's not a word said.  I mean, seriously, this movie has flaky layers of movie awesomeness.  I love the way it shows how a relationship--no matter the style--has to grow organically; too often relationships are defined and compared to what is actually their caricature:  from classic 50's hetero to BDSM harnesses and ball-gags to gay cowboys eating pudding--none of these represent the natural relationships that arise between two people.  What's relatable for anyone who's been in love is the same across the board: there's something in one that calls and the other answers (and vice versa).

Beautifully done; I just wish there were some guide besides the commentary to help out with all that symbolism and meaning there.  This movie should've won tons of awards.  Wish iTunes carried it.",1300492800,2,1217,4.926470588235294
1840017,4,B00008DDSC,"`Secretary' is at film about the relationship between a secretary called Lee, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, and her boss Edward played by James Spader. Initially it starts out as quite a sedate film with the boss being arrogant and rude, then he starts to humiliate her for minor work infractions, moving up to spanking, before their relationship takes a deeper turn. Much has been said about the sexual and deviant nature of this film and to be honest I have to say that is a lot of hype and over exaggeration. There is a sexual current running through the film, but it isn't anywhere near as deviant or shocking as some may make out. This film is more about one woman's development from a nave young adolescent, into a mature sexualised woman. Lee starts off by being unsure and shy and by the end of the film she is confident and sure of her feelings and wants out of life. This is slightly kooky and offbeat and Gyllenhaal turns out an excellent performance, managing to be by turns funny and kooky, sweet and innocent and sexy and self assured. All impressive stuff in what was one of her early movies. This has now become something of a minor cult film and if you enjoy unusual films and don't mind some risqu themes then this is well worth watching at some point.

First and most important than nothing, it's I don't know how a wealthy lawyer from the USA has his  office plenty of electro- mechanical typewriters. No one computer or word processor is seen there. Secondly, yes, This poor  secretary have a wonderful fabulous backside for seating during so many  hours of hard work, we agree in that, but most Hollywood actress have these solid attributes and her task it's less painful. It's only this poor secretary logically commits too many errors in typewriting so much paper and it seems she merits to be punished. The lawyer, his chief, doesn't seems to be very passionate for this task, but the secretary yes, very much. I think all the problem should be solved by buying a PC. According my personal experience, a relation based over the basis of this movie cannot be durable, but one never knows, as the men she knows are much less able in beating her than she in typewriting.",1290902400,,1001,4.708571428571428

Both characters were allowed to be who they were and were so complimentary to each other. The movie showed how they lead each other and affirmed each other's roles.

I thought it would be that he was dominating her and that she acquiesed to him ultimately, but that's not it.  He frees her and lets her be who she is without being ashamed.  I love that. And she actually embraces her feeling more than he does at first.  She accepts it and he feels guilty about it and doesnt really understand why he is the way he is.  She doesnt care and all she knows is that she likes it.  I guess I am rambling but the bottom line is that 2 consenting adults should be able to do whatever floats their boat as long as it isn't hurting anyone else and that is basically what this movie is about.  No one in my opinion does love/sex scenes better than Mr. Spader and the final scenes when he gives in and admits that he loves her are so sweet and real.  I just loved it.

She gives herself pain and in return gets pleasure from it. In the beginning of the film Lee gets out of the hospital and looks for a job. He starts working for a lawyer, Mr. Grey (James Spader). Mr. Grey himself has psychological issues having to do with control. Initially the relationship they have is sort of shocking, but you soon realize that it may actually be healthy. The issues that they have sort of come together to fit in a yin yang. They begin to complement each other.  Lee was a good role for Maggie Gyllenhaal. I think she did very well. I always enjoy watching James Spader's performances. He can act sophisticated and professional, yet crude and mean at the same time. He was also perfect in the movie Pretty and Pink. I recommend this film for the open minded. It is not a typical romance film. What I thought was so genuine to the characters was that it wasn't just the act of sex and affection that brought the lovers together, but a specific quality that brought Lee and Mr. Grey together.",1284336000,2,1190,4.50462962962963

1840029,5,B00008DDSC,"One of those take it or leave it, hate it or love it movies, Secretary is an on the edge yet non-judgmental look at BDSM, or, to the squares out there, Bondage Domination Sadomasochism.

Innocent and self-destructive, and recently released from a psych ward, Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal) self-mutilates to make up for her poor self-esteem and repressed sexual submissiveness.  After taking up typing she applies for a job as a secretary for E. Edward Grey (James Spader), an OCD lawyer with an apparently bustling law practice.  As the two grow to know one another, they learn a shared appreciation for an unorthodox physical, psychological, emotional attraction that transforms Lee from a pathetic girl next door into a more confident person and unleashes the creepy sadist sequestered inside Grey's calm demeanor.

Gyllenhall and Spader act perfectly, but I suspect it's because they're perfect for the role.  She conveys emotion perfectly in this role because she appears to be a person of great emotional fragility and considerable deferment.  On the other hand, Spader delivers every role in his own collected style that's a bit too good not to be partially truthful.  I can't imagine any other actor in either role.

Romantic and taboo at the same time, the plot flows well with some dark humor filling the gaps between BDSM scenes.  Beautifully filmed shots of long hallways in which secretaries must crawl to their master and hard desks on which delicious derrieres receive rosy handprints.  Highly recommended.

Lee is a masochist who needs to be dominated.  She's spent time in an institution only to find the man of her dreams in the form of her employer.

Her employer wants to dominate, and fears being dominated.  He eventually learns of Lee's needs and seemingly knows how to deal with them.  In the end the couple presumably lives happily ever after, though we don't know that for sure.

This film is definitely not for everyone.  For those who crave bizarre, they must realize this is still a mainstream movie which must conform to certainparameters.  The characters are rather drab, almost trite, but they do eventually seem to grow on the viewer's imagination.  Many male viewers may want to have the type of relationship with a women as portrayed in this film.

True BDSM is not about throwing down and having sex every two seconds, if you wanted that, then go watch some teen sex comedy crap. This was about the relationship between a submissive and a dominant. It takes time to build trust with a partner in a relationship such as this and I think that film portrayed it brilliantly. This is a film the definitely deserves 5 stars for accurately portraying a D/S relationship.

The subtleties of the performances are what get to me and under my skin, in a good way! The bond in which this unlikely pair forms is endearing and inspiring. The S&M angle, to me, is a lighthearted one, not necessarily to be taken seriously as it is more of a tool used to connect these two fragile souls.

1840044,5,B00008DDSC,"The amazing thing about this movie is that it blends the human desire for sexual passion with our ultimate desire to find a soul mate on this earth who can embrace our deepest selves even at our dirtiest core--and more importantly bring validity to it. Mr. Grey has a problem with sexual dominance that causes him to run through secretaries very quickly while Lee, who comes to work for him is a confused young woman with an affinity for self-induced pain.

Eventually the two learn of each other's socially unacceptable quirks and come to satisfy each other's needs, which were prior to unfulfilling and incomplete. The S&M between both Lee and Mr. Grey is by no means centered on pornography, which would separate sexual desire from intimacy and is used simply for the means of erotic pleasure but rather an intimate and unique bond that corny as it sounds completes both Lee and Mr. Grey.  This is why Lee must tell Mr. Grey that she loves him and wants to make love to him--her feelings for him are not just erotic but centered on a deep and complex bond that can only be founded in love.

The ending is one for the hopeless romantic where the heroine, Lee has saved Mr. Grey with her relentless loyalty and complete devotion bringing him back to life and melting his once removed and icy heart as he romantically carries her upstairs to a private love making lair.

This is definitely a unique movie that you'll never forget and will probably have a strange love affair with. Both men and women can find something in this movie but as you've probably guessed is for the older crowd.",1240790400,5,1587,4.597173144876325

1840046,4,B00008DDSC,"When I think of erotic movies, I usually remember overstylized and heavy handed music video versions of movies that have little-to-no-understanding of how each particular lifestyle works.  The characters never feel like real people and their ""exploration"" into the kinky side of their sex lives comes across fake poses and clueless renderings--usually with bright lights and really loud music.  Since it's Hollywood, there has to be moment of ""self-discovery"" and/or ""hitting bottom"" before true, normal love prevails.  And they lived happily ever after.

I remember reading about Stanley Kubrick's research for his orgy scenes in his final film, EYES WIDE SHUT.  After studying Roman orgies and such, he wasn't sure how to write the scenes where Tom Cruise infiltrates a high society orgy.  How does such things really work?  The only thing that made that scene work were the masks.  The quasi-religious ritual of pairing up partners...not so much.

But then along comes SECRETARY.  And it works because it doesn't focus on the wild and kinky side of sex, but because it allows the kinks to come out of Real Characters.  Maybe that's why there are so few successful films about this (or any other) alternative lifestyle: the filmmakers are too fascinated by the acts than by the characters acting them out.

In the extras, the director said he wanted to make a film about a successful S & M relationship the way that the earlier film MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDERETTE did for a gay relationship.  Mission accomplished.

The only reason I'm not giving this film 5 stars is that I couldn't track James Spader's character development as easily as I could Maggie Gyllenhaal's.  She is a genuine character who fully communicates everything visually and verbally and I was able to follow her.  Great actress, great part.  Spader was a little less defined.  As Maggie's character accepts and achieves her identity, I was wondering if Spader was as sure of his own sexual identity as the movie played out.

Knowing people in this particular lifestyle, I have to try and ascertain from where this particular bent comes from--and how it expresses itself.  Yes, it's different, but I know people who love this style of relationship and see it as another avenue of pleasure, not some sick, twisted acting out of dark, crazy mental/emotional ailment.  There's nothing wrong with them, they just enjoy this.  I find that interesting.  And SECRETARY tells their story.",1237075200,4,2445,5.042394014962594

I did not find this to be a comedy even though it has some good comic elements.
Also I suspect many people who have reveiwed this here did not understand some parts of it.
Lee, the main character does cut herself, but it seems to be the way she has learned to escape the pain of her life. The release of endorphans from the cutting pain, helps her feel better.
Mr. Grey, the lawyer is truly a lost soul. I would have to even conclude that he suffers from Aspergers syndrome based on his behavior: He is bright, shy and has a difficult time relating to other people in a normal way. He is really a gentle person, even releasing mice caught in his office back outside. Growing orchids. He has trouble reconciling his quiet nature with his need for dominance in his relationships.
Therein lies the crux of the story.
Well done, sensual and fun. However without being familiar with or having read up on the BDSM lifestyle mny viewers may not really understand the story. There are many books on this on Amazon, including Consensual Spanking and others.

But there are some outrageous scenes that make up for the somewhat (ahem) sick sexual practices that the boss and secretary go through.

Jeremy Davies (Saving Private Ryan, Solaris, Rescue Dawn), as Lee's spaced-out boyfriend Peter, lends welcomed comic relief to some pretty dark and painful scenes (pun intended).

You could fixate yourself on the S&M aspect and be blind to everything else, unable to look past the red-rears and handcuffs.

I saw this movie as about a woman discovering who she is in a world she never knew existed. Yes, James Spader's character is a bit odd, dominating her with almost Nazi-like authority. But the girl holds herself, finding out how strong she really is and how much she can endure. It's about discovering what really drives you forward and makes you who you are. It's about being able to look passed what society thinks as normal and create your own world with your own rules.

The movie started a bit slow, then gradually picked up momentum. By the end I was so pulled into it I wanted more. A short ""making of"" segment and trailer are the only special features on this DVD. Not much else, but then again I couldn't imagine what more could be added.

Neither is it done justice by the view of Mary Gaitskill that this is the ""Pretty Woman"" version of the short story this movie is based on.  ""Secretary"" is not a salacious Dom-sub movie, but it has cinematic qualities that recommend it as something more than a Hollywood romantic comedy.

From a set and costume perspective, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Everything chosen for this film is textured, highly sensuous, and beautiful, and the cinematography is well crafted to show off the props without detracting from the story-telling.  The script is also well done with adequate dialog and good plot development.  I hadn't read anything about this film beforehand, I honestly didn't know how it was going to turn out right up til the end, and I wanted to find out!  There is only one really unfortunate choice--a video montage with a pop music soundtrack around 1:40:00 takes you out of the world the director has sucked you into.  But that is only one instance.

As for the Dom-sub theme, I was prepared to be turned off, but I was not.  Despite the theme, the movie is not sadistic in its treatment of the heroine.  It invites us to be sympathetic with her, and the James Spader character actually helps her stop one unhealthy and damaging clinical expression of psychopathology.  Whether the relationship that eventually develops between Gyllenhaal and Spader should be considered ""healthy"" (or is itself an expression of psychopathology) is something for psychologists and sexologists to debate among themselves, but ""Secretary"" does not invite us to leer at exploitation the way a film like ""Boogie Nights"" does.

This is not a film I would watch with my parents or children, or with hard-left feminists.  But I would watch it with friends or possibly a date (not the first).  If you are a film aficionado or if you enjoy off-beat films (like Tim Burton), you really need to see this one, although I think it could be enjoyed by just about anybody who doesn't have a knee-jerk reaction to the theme.",1221004800,,2180,4.791443850267379
1840062,4,B00008DDSC,"I finally saw this film. I've always liked Maggie Gyllenhaal (Mona Lisa Smile, etc.) and she carried this first lead role like a confident pro. Indeed, she was fine, as was James Spader, more in control than the roles for which he's known. My favorite of all, however, is Jeremy Davies. A very earnest and complete performance. Steven Shainberg has crafted a film that shocks, amuses, and finally leaves the audience with a happy feeling.",1220140800,,438,4.8533333333333335
1840063,4,B00008DDSC,I found the movie to be very thought provoking in ref to human nature and how different people like different things in a relationship and sexually.

1840064,4,B00008DDSC,"Like other reviewers, I rented ""Secretary"" because of Maggie Gyllenhaal, whose work over the years since 2003 meant that I had to go back and see ""Secretary,"" knowing she probably bungee-jumped head first into this dangerous role.

I'm going to comment on the lasting impressions for me, not in order of importance:

I was thrilled by the brilliant moments when the characters (he and she) reached out to, and came to understand each other.  The world is a cold and lonely place for human beings because we all need affection and companionship.  But for many reasons, it is terribly difficult to find and connect with soul mates, let alone like minds.

I loved the scene when he explains why he thinks she is cutting herself and tells her she doesn't need to do it anymore.  At that moment, if only for a moment, she finally got the understanding and affection she desperately needed and deserved.  And although it didn't occur as suddenly, she definitely came to understand him and what he needed.

""Secretary"" delivers the goods for those viewers with mostly prurient interests.  However, I thought the displays of physical intimacy between these two people who come to care for each other, unencumbered by what is generally accepted by society, was gracefully done. No, I don't mean the spanking or humiliation.  I mean, for example, the scenes of tenderness, like the one near the end when he worships every inch of her body (particularly one very special inch).

I enjoyed the tension and near anguish portrayed by the actors as they approached terrifying moments requiring all their courage.  Breaking through barriers, taking risks, and experimenting is scary.  I saw these two characters battle through walls of anonymity and loneliness to make a connection with each other.

Many narrow lines are walked in this movie.  The most important and dangerous of these lines, of course, was knowing when risky behaviors like these are selfless, tender examples of lovemaking, and when they are selfish, cruel exploitation.  In ""Secretary,"" we are given many clues about it being the former, rather than the latter.  But do we really always know?  Of course not.  Did the characters always know?

I would have awarded five stars had the character development for the male lead been anywhere near what it was for her.  And I would have liked more balance between the two of them, in terms of giving and taking.  Its easier to see how the subservient role is giving to the dominant role than it is the other way around.  And there were moments when I laughed, but whenever I did, I felt I wasn't being honest to the drama.",1217116800,,2621,4.840449438202247
1840065,5,B00008DDSC,"(SPOILER WARNING.)  There is no question that this is one of the oddest love stories I have ever seen.  A young woman, with a quirky beauty that reveals itself over the course of the film, evolves from a self-mutilating mental patient to a fully realized and loving wife.  It is an extraordinary transformation, told in the form of comedy, and the viewer can believe it.

The acting is wonderful.  Spader is at his absolute best:  creepy, with bizarre tastes to say the least, yet full of need in a way that is understandable and increasingly vital.  From a rigid obsessive type, he becomes a man in search of love, even if it involves ropes and a saddle.  This is also Gyllenhaal's first starring role and she is magnificent.  The supporting characters from her hapless boy toy to her alcoholic father and co-dependant mother are also excellent.

As many have noted, this film had to tread an extremely fine line.  One the one hand, there is no question that the couple is perverted.  They indulge in pain, humiliation, and bondage.  On the other hand, though so wounded and inhibited, they forge a true relationship.  Their journey is moving, at times titillating, and even fascinating.

Warmly recommended.  The range of human behavior is forever unfathomable and unpredictable.  This film shows what a mystery life and the hope for love can be.",1216944000,,1348,4.816593886462882

It is, without a doubt, the sweetest hard-core love story ever made.
My suggestion: Watch the movie once, then immediately watch it again with the sound off, so you can appreciate the beautiful staging and use of color without getting wrapped up in the dialogue again.  If you are not absolutely blown away by the opening scene, you need a CAT-scan.  My only complaint (which is hardly a complaint) is that there could have been a little more background on Mr. Grey.

James Spader is right at home as the weird guy who turns out to be the perfect complement to this disturbed woman and the one person in her life who can bring out the best in her.  Their interplay reveals some truths about human nature that maybe only the adventurous and honest among us would admit they recognize.  S&M, per-se, certainly isn't everyone's cup of tea.  Still, there's something insightful about the success of their particular relationship.

This film celebrates the uniqueness of the individual human spirit.  This film screams about acceptance and appreciation of oneself -- and to acknowledge and honor the normal and quirky traits we all possess.  This movie is truly a great film.  It will undoubtedly go down as an important cult classic -- I would argue on the same par as cult classics ""The Graduate"" and ""Harold and Maude.""

That said, be warned that if you are uncomfortable with the idea of bdsm being anything other then a sickness then ""keep on walking"" because this is not a movie for you.

One of the things I liked most was the depth of character development.  Gyllenhaal and Spader had fantastic chemistry and were able to pack so much emotion and communication in to simple expressions and gestures.  I can't say enough good things about the work they have done here.

As for the story, I LOVE IT!  Both Mr. Grey (Spader) and Lee (Gyllenhaal) start out in dark places.  Lee is drifting in life and has taken to cutting herself.  Mr. Grey is alone and disgusted with himself.  Both struggle with ""unnatural"" feelings and a sense of detachment, they just don't feel normal.

1840088,5,B00008DDSC,"My first viewing of the campy film Secretary could not have been more ironic because I had been working as a secretary -- ahem, assistant -- for a solo practitioner for only two months. I recall leaving the theater feeling empowered despite knowing that the next day I would have to fetch whatever my boss wanted, when he wanted it. There are bosses, not just the lawyers, who long for the old-fashioned secretary.

Bravo to the filmmaker for rendering Secretary's unflinching revelations about emotional pain as unsettling as its erotic depictions of the catharsis of that pain. I found, and still find, the film to be a surreal and vicarious pleasure. Not that what ensues between the boss and assistant in Secretary is unrealistic. Perhaps you know of a solo proprietor whose temp secretaries kept quitting but who now has a full-time assistant. Why is that assistant a perfect match?

Intellectually, I admire the filmmaker's courage in commenting poetically upon the ways in which American society conditions women to be passive and to devalue themselves. Leave it to an art/indie film to expose how some (or many?) American women find themselves either stuck in a time warp of adolescent vanity or suffering through existential paralysis. Because American women are taught to identify and value themselves through their relationships with men, it is a total thrill in Secretary to watch the script flip the stereotype of the skirt-chasing boss on its head.

In terms of casting, I cannot imagine anyone but Maggie Gyllenhaal in the title role. Her secretary is like the repressed alter ego of Elizabeth Taylor's Maggie the Cat on that hot tin roof -- full of angst but no less smoldering. Maggie G. appears to purr rather than speak. James Spader, who once upon a time seemed typecast as a snooty yuppie, gets the chance in Secretary to fully realize his erotic potential. While his character can be viewed as tongue-in-cheek, he delivers a genuinely quirky and sensitive performance.

When you get down to it, the various vicarious experiences in Secretary will please some and repulse others. For me, I received instant motivation to strive for accuracy in transcribing my boss's future dictation.",1174435200,4,2205,5.032876712328767

1840099,5,B00008DDSC,"Foremost, Shainburg's film is based on a short-story from Mary Gaitskill's ""Bad Behavior"" collection. Shainberg first made a film-short from this work. Remaining true to the original, the film was dark and concluded with the mental destruction of ""Debby"" (later renamed ""Lee""). Shainberg states that he wanted to create the this new adaptation years ago, but could not find backing for his quirky film. Following a wave of successful feminist-films (Shainberg credits Jane Campion in particular), the director was able to return to this piece. With the guidance of Maggie Gyllenhaal (only twenty-three at the time!), the script was rewritten to empower Lee. Every word was scrutinized ... the team even had Lizzie West re-record the song ""Chariots Rise"" because of a single line that might detract from the overall positive message. So have no reservations about this work ... after a rigorous rewrite, ""Secretary"" is a feminist-film about ""choice."" (Remember, Lee chooses to remain at the desk ... in this moment, she is the ""master"" of Grey's future. She holds his heart in her hands). From Gaitskill's gloomy eight-pages to Shainberg's lush tale, one marvels at this director's talent for adaptation!

While many viewers focus on Lee's transformation (logically so since she narrates), this film is as much about Mr. Grey's transformation as it is hers. The wonder of this work resides in beholding two ""sick"" people make each other healthy. Watch how posture straightens, how facial ticks disappear, how voices become bolder, and how both Lee and Grey become more radiant as the film progresses. Compare their initial encounter with the film's final scene to confirm that they nurture each other. (This is also underscored by Shainberg's repeated use of symmetry. Note how the film's framing often creates an almost split-screen effect ... harmony resides here).

I feel it necessary to note that this film does not imply that Grey ""cures"" Lee's desire for self-mutilation. Psychologically speaking, Lee simply replaces the pain she experiences from cutting with the ""pain"" of spanking. In this, the film remains realistic and truthful to the disease. And, one is forced to wonder ... would a life with docile Peter push Lee back to her cutting-kit and polyester dresses? What can he offer her as a substitute for her pain?

A technical note: if you are screening ""Secretary"" for the first time, (or are a fan already), you will want to watch the prevalence of the color purple. In film, ""purple"" can signify transformation ... but is also the color of childishness (think about how often you see purple adult-clothing ... now think about how often you see purple clothing on children) ... but, one must not forget that purple is also the color of bruises. How do these all tie together? Watch how purple moves from Lee's personal-life to her work-life ... seemingly indicating a transition from silly snowglobes to hidden bruises ... from a giggling woman suffering arrested-development to a poised woman choosing a very adult lifestyle. And watch for ""purple's"" childish resurgence in a hideous grape-shaped ring-box presented in the basement of J.C.Penny's (you will know when you see it!)

Shainberg's film can seem slow to the uninitiated. Conservative (read: ""timid"") viewers or those unaccustomed to indie films may not enjoy it. For the rest, it is deliciously tormenting! It is playful, funny, and dark. For me, its charms are uplifting. Since it is designed as a fairy-tale for adults, ""Secretary"" plays on the notion that ""there is someone for everyone."" In a way, it is a chick-flick with a twist (and Shainberg confirms that women tend to gravitate to this film more than men ... but men can certainly enjoy it!)

This film is a rare gem for anyone interested in the ""softer-side"" of SMBD, in WAY off-beat romance, or even in feminist film.",1164758400,5,3857,5.067716535433071
1840100,5,B00008DDSC,"Let's be honest. Sex is a fundamental aspect of all of our lives, yet most of us are really afraid to deal with it honestly. This movie deals with a particular aspect of sexuality in a refreshingly honest way. Whether you know anything about dominance/submission or not, this film is remarkable in that it gives us all a glimpse of what that particular sexual dynamic is all about, and it does it in a way that is quite frankly, non-sensational and non-gratuitous. And you do not need to have any affinity with dominance or submission to really 'get' and enjoy this movie, for it goes much deeper. This is a excellent character study.

The film is quite erotic, although very little actual sex is shown. It's power is in the anticipation and what is NOT said. It's about NEED. As several other reviewers have brought out here, there's alot going on here besides the allure of a taboo form of sex. The beauty of the film is in it's subtlety and the depth of the characters, which the director takes time to develop.

Both James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal are compatible complements in this story, which really is a story about 'complements'. It's about finding that balance in the energy between two people. There is a silent, powerful unspoken attraction between the two characters that transcends their established professional roles. The viewer can really just 'sense' this dynamic building throughout the film.

There is so much here that is communicated just with the look in the eyes. There is so much that is unspoken, yet if you pay attention, you know what is going on. I think it's great film-making. In an age when we are innundated with quick, flash images every other second, sensational sex and violence for it's own sake, and a total LACK of character development, I find it refreshing to see a movie like this that moves slowly on purpose to develop the phyche of the characters, and Secretary does that superbly.

I also find it refreshing that a film be made about this rather taboo subject with an non-judgmental, open honesty. After all, in the end, its a LOVE story. A story of fufilled and satified needs on both ends of the equation. And really, isn't that what any successful relationship is really about? The look in Lee's face in the last frame of the movie says it all.",1163980800,10,2297,4.678217821782178

It isn't just about bondage, pain and humiliation. It's also about pleasure, caring and love. It's about realizing who you are and being unafraid of it. The story ends on an unrepressed happy note. Although some of us debate whether or not she should have gone back to the office with him.

One of the keys to happiness is to be who you are and not what others want you to be. And that is a common Hollywood theme and universal truth that cuts across all ideology and sexual orientations.",1156809600,8,863,4.910958904109589
1840105,3,B00008DDSC,"In the tradition of Boogie Nights, Secretary takes the taboo and wraps it in a typical romance format.  Boogie Nights told a coming of age family story that happened to involve porn; Secretary tells a romance that happens to involve sadomasochism.

Our heroine is the vulnerable Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal, sister to brother Jake of Donnie Darko fame).  Gyllenhaal has a waifish, almost unearthly look about her that radiates a sad vulnerability, which makes her perfect for the role.  As Lee, she players a character filled with self-loathing, hating herself so much that she not-so-secretly cuts her thigh with a razorblade.  When her parents eventually discover her destructive habits, they commit her to a mental institution.  Lee is eventually released, but she will never truly get ""better.""

As an important first step in escaping her restrictive home life, Lee gets a job as a secretary.  She works for the intimidating Mr. Grey (James Spader), who brooks no failure.  Working for the handsome boss turns out to be a challenge Lee enjoys, in more ways than one.

Once Mr. Grey discovers that Lee is a masochist, he takes slowl but subtle control of her world. Grey alternately sets Lee free and dominates her by telling her she will never cut herself again.  And Lee complies, throwing away her box of sewing equipment that she used to mutilate herself.

But Lee's release is also a taste of the forbidden that she craves.  Eventually, Mr. Grey resorts to spanking as a form of discipline, a torture she enjoys.  Thus begins the S&M relationship between boss and secretary.

Although they don't sleep with each other, the two engage in kinkier pleasures as the days go by.  In the mean time, Lee continues the faade of a normal life, dating a bland boy named Peter (Jeremy Davies) who offers an equally bland future.  Eventually, he proposes; in a haze, Lee accepts.

But she shouldn't have, and she knows it.  Mr. Grey's affections stop as he is overcome with guilt for what he has done to Lee.  He fires her and, we come to realize, perpetuates a cycle of anticipation, secret pleasure, and guilt.  But unlike the secretaries in the past, Lee has no intention of giving up on her man.

The ending is at least as torturous as the movie itself is to watch.  Mr. Grey, disturbed at Lee's infatuation with him, orders her to sit at his desk and stay there until he says otherwise. Finally standing up for something, anything, Lee refuses to remove her palms from the desk.  For days.

Secretary is a character piece, and Lee does not disappoint.  She puts her considerably talents, her raw vulnerability, before the camera both physically and emotionally.  She's so vulnerable, in fact, that it's sometimes hard to watch.

Despite its subject matter, Secretary steadfastly refuses to exploit its characters.  Secretary lays the framework for a typical romance, despite the fact that it sometimes involves spanking and a horsewhip. We come to realize that these two deeply troubled people relate to each other through pain.  And as long as they trust each other, that's okay.

Although it's certainly not for everybody, Secretary puts an entertaining twist on the usual boy meets girl format.  It's more girl meets boy, boy spanks girl, and they live happily ever after.",1156723200,9,3280,4.885869565217392

1840107,4,B00008DDSC,"Secretary explores the attraction of a dominant/submissive relationship, and other less ""normal"" preoccupations.

James Spader seems made to play these parts since ""Sex Lies and Videotape"" and the return with ""Crash"".  In ""Secretary"" he plays a lawyer with obsessive compulsive tendancies who has undergone a series of unconsumated forays into S & M or D & S  relationships with his secretaries, but ultimately has bowed out because he is unable to take them further.

Maggie Gyllenhall is excellent as the self-harming, low esteem child of an alcoholic father who is seeking to live a ""normal"" life.  She wants what her sister has, the husband, the family, the home in the suburbs.  Instead she has an obsession with cutting herself, an activity which delivers a momentary high once the pain has been delivered.

When the self-harming secretary and the OCD lawer meet it is a match made in heaven, almost.  Dr Grey tries to bow out as he has done in the past.  But this time he has met his match, a girl who is prepared to up the stakes to continue the relationship.  How far can they take it?  You must watch to find out.

It's also funny without being silly.  I spent part of the film flinching, part laughing, and part being turned on.

1840113,5,B00008DDSC,"""Secretary"" is an excellent if eccentric romantic story (so to speak) where the main actors, Lee and Mr Grey, played their delicate roles exceptionally well, particularly for Lee in this her first starring role.

Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a nervous, frustrated, aimless, innocent and vulnerable lady who had recently been released from a mental institution. She has a very low self-esteem and an eccentric habit of inflicting pain on herself. After her release from mental institution, she acquires a secretarial qualification and gets a job at the law firm of E. Edward Grey. Mr Grey (James Spade) is an imperious and perfectionist lawyer. He employs Lee, who stirs dark and shameful urges in him. Mr Grey is a sadist who believes in sexual dominance. He subjects Lee to spanking for minor typing errors which, strangely enough she enjoys. There is natural chemistry between these two unusual characters. Ironically, although Mr Grey is supposed to be the dominant character, it is in fact Lee that exercises immense power on her employer. He in fact needs and desires her desperately.

Some people may find the film disturbing and shocking with an apparently vulnerable lady at the mercy of a fussy and sadistic boss with kinky sexual desires. The submissive character of Lee may present her as someone deserving of protection. Most normal people may find the relationship between Lee and Mr Grey very weird and perhaps unreal, being a fictional creation of Hollywood. However, for those that are open minded and enjoy dark humour, the film should be of a lot of interest. It may also enlighten people that indeed S & M does exist and this brings originality into the film.",1141171200,13,1685,4.99288256227758

When we meet her she is so pretty, so endearing, and so thoroughly vulnerable that we immediately want to protect her. The next is James Spader. Normally seeing his name associated with a movie makes me want to stick hot needles into my eyes. Spader is often found in awful movies and frequently observed being awful in good ones. He exudes a predatory smarm, as though half his soul went missing. But here he is cast against type. Though playing the part of S in this S&M tango, he's victimized by an obsessive need to control and is far from mastering it.

The demure and adorable Ms. Gyllenhaal, by contrast, intentionally populates his letters with typos to incur welcome wrath and discipline, there is strength and power in her weakness. The third is director Steven Shainberg's even-handed way of presenting the affair. Had he gone for smutty leering, or worse, broad belly laughs, the film would quickly have degenerated and become dumb and unpleasant. Instead he delivers a real, erotic yarn about two people getting what they want and need, with no one being hurt. Restraint was carefully employed and the result is a sweet, if unusual love story.

She's hired for her first-ever job by attorney Edward Gray (James Spader), whose aggressive work persona conceals both a genuine concern for Lee's welfare and a raft of deep-seated insecurities. Their dynamic evolves slowly into a playfully fulfilling domination/submission relationship, involving a lot of mental powerplay but no nudity or genital contact.

See this movie to appreciate how Lee owns her newfound submissive identity and, through it, finds genuine emancipation and empowerment.

What is this movie? A wonderful story about two people who need and love each other. They are both quirky, strange, and by most ""normal"" peoples standards weird. They are different sides of the same coin, and this movie brings them together.

There are moments, when you'll find yourself laughing out loud at some of the parts - not because they are bad, or unintentionally funny, but because they are truly hilarious and creative.  There are other moments when you hurt for the characters in the movie, not because the spanking was ""too hard"" but because you can see they love each other, but are too shy to admit it (even to themselves); and because of this, nearly lose each other.

All past screen kisses and hugs wane weak in the face of this little indie flick, including Rhett Butler's carriage of Scarlet up that grand staircase.

While Gyllenhall's portrayal of a socially stunted and life needy  girl-woman makes the viewer love her and comprehend here's a lost soul putting hot pots against her skin to 'feel': so a little S & M pain is good for her. Each character an 'oddball'; together a 'fireball'. I've played this one over and over and have enjoyed each showing; catching new things with each spin.

He can be the ideal lover women dream of or the villain we love to hate, he does it all with such superb confidence. Through those whispery tones in his voice and those sensual eyes with the deep methodical stares.

I feel he brings an aura of sexual magnetism to most of the characters he portrays. And he sure brought the spice into this film. I often wonder how much of his acting expertise does he use to achieve that charismatic illusion, or does that intoxicating magnetic energy just flow from him naturally?

I loved this movie with him and Maggie Gylanhall and I feel considering the sexual nature of the material it was played with very good taste. The movie was marvelous because both actors together, made it work so well.

""The Secretary"" is a story about two people who find love and are able to share something most people would see as distrubing or ""wrong"".  Steven Shainberg and Erin Cressida Wilson did an amazing job bringing this short story to the big screen.  The movie makes you realize that not everyone has the same idea of what love is, yet, it's all the same.  I don't know, just buy it.  It's good.

1840137,3,B00008DDSC,"Am I the only reviewer that has read the short story that this film was based on?  I've read over fifty of the reviews, and there has been no mention of the source material.

In any case, this movie is based (very loosely) on a short story by Mary Gaitskill, in a book published circa 1989 called ""Bad Behavior"".

Gaitskill is a phenomenally gifted writer, and much more intelligent than the people who produced and directed this film.  I haven't read anywhere what her opinion of the movie is, but I'll tell you mine.

Hollywood regularly takes the works of fiction writers and bastardizes them in order to make them more appealing to  audiences.  Usually this means juicing something up with more titillation.  In this case, they took a dark, Darwinistic look at office politics and sex and turned it into a sweetened, Mary Poppins-in-whips-and-chains postfeminist movie in the vein of ""Fatal Attraction"", ""Pretty Woman"", and ""Basic Instinct.""

Look at it this way:  when an author describes a rather repugnant lawyer masturbating behind his secretary as ""making furious rodent-like sounds"" and ""spattering hot muck"", do you think she (the author) is sympathetic towards the character?

They turned a seedy (pun intended) low-life lawyer into a matinee idol--James Spader, and made the secretary into an unawakened freethinker, when in the book she was a character with basically no sense of herself at all, and certainly no self esteem.

Maggie Gyllenhaal (lately in the news for speaking her mind about 9-11) is superb in this movie, I'll grant you that.  She is a young actress on the rise.  But the rest of the cast, including Spader, give very forgettable performances.  The movie just isn't that well made, and when you see the director's interviews, you'll understand why.

I would recommend that anyone intrigued by this movie investigate Mary Gaitskill's writing.  Besides ""Bad Behavior"", she wrote a novel called ""Two Girls, Fat and Thin""  which is an excellent dissection of the philosophy of Ayn Rand.  Of course, if Hollywood adapted that book for a movie, it would probably come out resembling ""Atlas Shrugged""....",1117497600,14,2130,5.034285714285715
1840138,5,B00008DDSC,"The opening scene of ""Secretary"" drops the viewer into the middle of the narrative. In a shot that will be repeated 55 minutes later, Lee carries out a variety of office duties with poise and efficiency --despite the fact that she is wearing a bizarre and uncomfortable-looking restraint that holds her arms straight out at the shoulders. The first time around the scene seems odd, almost repugnant; Lee lopes with unnerving calm to (longtime David Lynch collaborator) Angelo Badalamenti's creepy score around a unsettlingly baroque office. Then, abruptly, a title card: ""six months earlier"". The narrative proper begins.

At first, it's unclear what this circuitous opening adds to the story, apart from an element of suspense that might not be if the events unfolded in strict chronological order: the opening scene presents a big ""What?""; we wait anxiously to learn the ""Why"". What other purpose this scene might serve becomes clear with its reprise. By then a subtle understanding of its context is possible. The remarkable Maggie Gyllenhaal imbues Lee with such supple humanity that the viewer has become more than sympathetic, and understands how much this long-suffering, unassumingly brave woman is enjoying herself, arm-restraints and all. The scene is no longer unsettling, but celebratory. The scene hasn't changed. Maybe we have. Director Steven Shainberg, on the DVD commentary track, says he hopes that his film will do for S&M what ""My Beautiful Laundrette"" did for homosexuality almost 20 years ago-- increase mainstream understanding. Perhaps it will.

On the same commentary track, the film's writer Erin Cressida Wilson says that the uncertain ""Um....."" Lee utters after Edward has administered the first blow in the justly famous spanking scene is Wilson's ""Favorite line"". She then chuckles, and modestly refrains from explaining what she means. Why it's good: Although this pivotal scene is fraught with emotion, Lee's tentative ""Um....."" is the only line of dialogue in it that acknowledges, even obliquely, what is taking place. Unlike the painfully verbose, excruciatingly clever screenwriters who currently plague independent film, Wilson realizes that what people say may be only tangentially related to what they mean, or are thinking, or what's happening, and that great feeling may lurk behind the most banal or fragmentary remark. ""Secretary"" is one of the strictest, fullest applications of this principle imaginable (Each page of the screenplay must contain one column each for speech and subtext). Never glib, never clever, just smart, ""Secretary"" is certainly a comedy of some sort, but it contains nothing that exactly qualifies as a joke. Its minimal dialogue leaves wide expanses in which the actors can and must communicate non-verbally. The leads are up to the task. Gyllenhaal (""JILL-in-hall"") and the always watchable James Spader make adept use of the full actor's arsenal: facial expression, posture -watch Lee's gait change in the course of the film-, verbal pauses and inflection create a world of meaning beneath deceptively mundane, often monosyllabic, dialogue. Tune into these actors' peculiar wavelength and be spellbound.",1116374400,16,3173,5.421052631578948
1840139,3,B00008DDSC,"S&M can add some spice to life, but there's more than that going on here. Ridiculous as it was, the film kept me glued to the screen right up until the anti-climatic conclusion. To what degree is Secretary proclaiming itself as reality? If a film is surreal, then one does not necessarily try to make sense of it (to discern the intentions of the screenwriter, for example), and may instead choose to just view it in the abstract. If Secretary is not a surreal film, then we are running into some problems here.

I could (but won't) echo some of the sentiments shared by reviewers who rated it at 4 or 5 stars. Overall, I'm on the fence about Secretary. Throughout the entire film I was trying to decide whether the protagonist [Lee] was becoming fulfilled, or whether her victimization was simply being prolonged (in a cage with golden bars). Do you condone a man who exploits a mentally ill woman because he has the status and means to get away with it? Well, that's exactly what goes on for the duration of Secretary, regardless of how much Lee smiles or masturbates when she thinks about her s#!thead boss. Whatever your opinion of S&M, keep in mind that Lee is more than a simple masochist. I'm far from an expert in the field, but my education included classes in psychology (including Abnormal Psychology), and I don't take the issue of mental illness lightly. While I'm not one to reinforce what is dictated to us as a mentally healthy lifestyle, I nonetheless find Secretary to be the opposite of liberating.

Yet even as I despised the main male character in the film (indeed, most of the characters are easy to despise, other than Lee), it challenged me to view him from Lee's perspective. Whatever your take, Secretary provides a challenge for the viewer: if that's what you want out a film, then go for it.",1116028800,7,1819,4.611111111111111
1840140,4,B00008DDSC,"Not quite in the same class as ""Muriel's Wedding"", ""Secretary"" is similar enough in theme, content, and style for it to be a safe viewing bet those who liked that film. ""Secretary"" suffers during its last third by not really having anywhere to go with the story it has introduced so entertainingly in the first two thirds of the film.

Fortunately, the cast comes through in the end even if the movie does not. By the end Maggie Gyllengaal (the title character), James Spader (her boss), and Jeremy Davies (her boyfriend) have all managed to achieve the rare distinction of leaving us convinced that no one else could have played their characters so well and that Director Steven Shainberg made three perfect casting decisions.

Most guys will have fallen in love with Gyllengaal by the midway point of the first trailer they see for the film. What they find in the film will confirm that their instincts were correct. Most actresses would have been unable to keep the character from seeming pathetic but Gyllenhaal makes her seem plucky, and her quiet assertiveness (once she has found something she wants) permits the film to transcend its political incorrectness and actually celebrate our uniqueness.

In what I thought the funniest scene, Gyllengaal and Davies take the stale ""fake organism"" device and play it better than it has ever been done. She is spectacularly under-whelmed by her first sex with him and he is so self-absorbed that even the most feeble sounds of pleasure in movie history do not clue him in about her true feelings.

Most of the interest (and humor) comes from checking out the subtle clues Gyllengall and Spader provide us about the changing status of their relationship, because a lot is happening between them that is not shown or even specified. The two have subtle little signals by which they step out of their roles, with subtle gestures they let each other (and the audience) know that they both know what they're doing. In this unique way we observe their growing recognition of the other's natures and needs; and eventually their realization that they are unlikely to ever find anyone else who so completely understands them.

Honest love stories, honest stories about anything, are rare hollywood product and this story pulls no punches.  Yet,  while the basis of the relationship of the two main characters, played by Spader and Gyllenhal, is a half reluctant half exuberant pull towards s/m/b/d, that is not the whole of their relationship.  And while their enjoyment and pleasure in these ritualistic, gorgeously shot activities is genuine and intense, they are still a kind of metaphor for the deeper meaning these two characters find in each others company, for the understanding that they engender in each other.  THis is not a story about sadomashochism-rather it's a story about a dominant and a submissive who happen to fit each other in almost every other way as well.

  And the pro-sex feminist in me thrills at a piece of fiction treating sex and sexuality as a way to empower a woman rather than demean or degrade her.  The main theme of Lee's life pre-Mr. Grey is one of being pushed around the emotions she's too sensitive to fully absorb and family members too absorbed to help her.  At the beginning of the movie, she is a kind of victim, not of her self-mutilation but of the emotional abuse that is at the root of her self-mutilation.  But her relationship with Mr. Grey, even though it's abstract and unusual, allows her to claim her emotions, to choose her life and it's partner without regard to anyone else's emotions or opinions.  When Lee tells poor peter close to the end of the movie, ""I don't want you"" she is actually saying, ""I want all of these other things and I will have them""  This is a giant step for Lee and one that the viewer feels she would've never made without a few cups of hot chocolate and a few well placed spankings.  Mr Grey has manpiulated Lee in the context of their dominant/submissive relationship, but her ability to own these moments between them have given her immeasurable confidence and joy.  (and yes, we kind of feel sorry for peter, but mostly because he hasn't found anything akin to Lee's strength in the post break-down world)

  When Lee places the certain object on the end of bed near  the closing moments of the movie, it is a symbol of the permanance, the indestructible quality of their love.  And in the actual closing moment, when Lee faces the camera and her gaze emits such power and grace and happiness she is daring anyone to tell her that she's wrong while also insinuating that such judgements are meaningless to her.  She is claming her own version of satisfaction and there is nothing more feminist than that.  ;)",1108771200,13,2689,4.676595744680851

There are many moments that probably shouldnt be funny, but they are. Lastly, there are moments that are so adorable and quirky that you can do nothing but smile.

The film opens with Lee (Maggie Gyllenhaal) getting out of a mental hospital. The same situation that landed her in the hospital is still happening, so she takes a typing class and starts looking for work. She becomes a receptionist for E. Edward Grey (James Spader). Mr. Grey is demanding and controlling when it comes to his business. However, he likes BDSM which causes him distress throughout the movie. He isn't using BDSM as a coping mechanism nor does he want to harm his partner; he just likes BDSM.  Lee is a complete doormat, but she gets better.

The only thing Lee and Grey seem to have in common is how closed off they are. Thus, the relationship that they have with each other allows both parties to open up and accept who they are. Grey becomes more content and honest. Lee becomes more assertive and confident.

Well, it is, but director Steven Shainberg has crafted a flick that's as much razor-sharp black comedy as it is kinkfest - nay, more so. Gyllenhaal and Spader both give beautifully nuanced turns, sketching a relationship that - all things considered - is curiously heartwarming, not to mention weirdly believable.

1840152,4,B00008DDSC,"Steven Shainberg's ""Secretary"" is not a movie for everyone, but it should be. It depicts with honesty and wit a S/M relationship, a kind of alternative lifestyle that is usually used as a punch line or a sick joke. Instead, ""Secretary"" treats it fairly, and ends up being a fascinating character study of two very damaged people finding love in their own way. It contains wonderful directing and a clever screenplay, and two brilliant performances by James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal.

""Secretary"" is the story of Lee Holloway, played to absolute perfection by Maggie Gyllenhaal. When we first meet Lee, she is being released from a mental institution. Lee comes from an unhappy family life, and has been cutting herself since she was fourteen years old. It isn't long before her father's alcoholism and her mother's cluelessness drive her to self-mutilation once again. Realising that she is in a precarious situation, the chronically self-conscious Lee decides to get a job for the first time in her life.

That's when she meets E. Edward Grey (James Spader), a lawyer who has an uncanny connection with Lee's pain. He hires Lee as his secretary, and it soon becomes obvious that Lee finds him attractive. Edward first plays humiliation games with Lee, such as forcing her to look for lost files in a dumpster, which she readily does. Then things get kinkier, as Edward begins to spank Lee when she makes a typo. Much to her surprise, Lee is incredibly turned on by this, and starts to make mistakes just to get punished.

The plot twists much further from there, but I won't give it away. ""Secretary"" is a duet between two exceptionally gifted actors, and James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal deliver honest and brave portrayals of two people drowning. What you remember most about ""Secretary"" are the silences, when the camera focuses only on the expressive faces of Spader and Gyllenhaal. You can see the unfathomable depths of Lee's pain on her face, and the love that Edward feels for her and his shame for acting it out on Spader's.

What makes ""Secretary"" a very important movie is summed up by Lee towards the end of the movie. She says, ""In one way or another I've always suffered. But I know I'm not so scared of suffering now. And I've found a way that's right for me."" In an age where so many films pass judgement on alternative lifestyles, ""Secretary"" simply says that this relationship is right for Lee and Edward, is loving and healthy. And what a refreshing thing that is.",1099526400,17,2490,4.783720930232558

1840155,5,B00008DDSC,"This movie pleasantly surprised me.  I didn't know what to expect.

First of all, I have to say Maggie's acting was superb.  The breadth of her character's range from weak to strong, simple to complex, and innocent to sensually manipulative, was amazing, far greater than I was prepared for. She starts out as a sad, sensitive, plain, frumpy girl who uses self-inflicting pain to deal with the psychological pain and stresses in her life. It helps keeps her from numbing out too much, and takes the focus away from the hurt in her heart.  She had been doing this for a long time, but an accidental severe injury put her in a mental care institution for a while, when it was thought she had attempted suicide. While there, she was able to find some self-esteem in learning secretarial skills. When released, she sought and found a job as a secretary with a quirky, anal, self-absorbed, demented, semi-genius loner of a lawyer who epitomized the term 'Control Freak'.

As a natural submissive, Lee fought harder to please each time she was debased and scolded over some small error she had done. Soon, it became a dance between she and her boss, with each of them creating excuses for him to discipline her.  As the relationship developed, so did Lee, becoming stronger as a person, and coming out of the shell where she had hidden her entire life. Although her boss was the dominant one, punishing her in erotic fashion, it was she who controlled the pace and action of the relationship.

There's a moderate amount of self-hatred on the part of her boss because of his behavior and outlook on life.  That prevents him from feeling good about where the relationship has gone.

When her boss understood he had lost control of their interactions and relationship, he fires her.  This leads to a showdown, with her boss making extreme demands in order to drive her away. Yet, Lee meets him head on, doing everything that was demanded of her, pushing herself even beyond her physical limits, to demonstrate both her love, and strength of the bond between the two of them.  That same intense bond that her boss was denying to both of them.

A crazy, erotic love story, with a breakout performance in a very unconventional role by a stunningly attractive actress I had never seen.

Can't say I was all that impressed with Spader's roll, but it worked well in conjunction with her work.

I found the message very appealing, that there's a chance for each one of us to find someone just right, no matter how different, kinky or weird we may be.

It gets to the point where her boss finally starts spanking her.  This changes her psyche and she no longer is attracted to her fiancee, who thinks it is a joke when she requests he spank her.

Her whole world seems lost, when her boss tires of the game and proceeds to fire her.  She then decides to go through with a wedding with her boyfriend, only to change her mind at the end with a scene reminiscent of The Graduate.

The reason it works is because it becomes clear that these two people are *good* people.  They have their issues, but deep down, they want love like everyone else.  And this IS a love story, with a arc just like any other love story.  It's very engaging and very funny, largely due to great performances by James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal.",1095379200,2,606,4.626168224299065

1840159,5,B00008DDSC,"I suppose I may be impartial due to the fact that this may well be one of my favorite movies of all time, but there is so much beauty in this script, it's hard to refrain from telling everyone I know!  This is a movie that is definitely not for everyone but the first time I saw this, it left me wanting to watch it again.  Some people will watch this and say ""Wow"" while others will say ""What the hell did I just watch?""

The movie begins with a fabulous performance by Maggie Gyllenhaal in her first starring role, as Lee, a troubled soul who finds comfort in self-mutilation, leaving a mental hospital.  After a stint for cutting too deep - ""I don't know how I could have misjudged, I've been doing it since the seventh grade..."" - she returns home to her dysfunctional family to try to begin life over again with the skills she has obtained from the institute.  Soon it seems, everything returns right back to the way it was - her father's out-of-control drinking, her parents fighting, her impulsively wanting to cut herself, but Peter enters and she finds some comfort in her high-school friend.

Lee enters a class in college to learn to type and soon is an efficient enough typist to decide to apply for a job she found in the paper, secretary.  James Spader, as attorney E. Edward Grey, who is also fabulous in this movie, enters as the neurotic, offbeat attorney.  From the beginning we find that Mr. Grey has his faults - ever wonder why there is a permanent ""Secretary Wanted"" sign outside his office?

Mr. Grey begins to get more and more ""strict"" it would seem with Lee, commonly using humiliation as a way to intimidate Lee.  One day Mr. Grey sits Lee down and asks her about the cutting - he has several times noticed signs of such.  He has a wonderful heart-to-heart with Lee and it is apparent that something between the two of them click as he tells her she will never cut herself again, have her mother pick her up from work and he lets her leave for the day, telling her to walk home through the park because she ""requires relief.""  Lee feels something inside of her and Mr. Grey growing and she senses a form of freedom deep inside herself because her gave her ""permission"" to do so.  But the next day, he is back to humiliating her, which ultimately leads to spankings and a world of sadism and masochism.

The beautiful part of the film finds Lee slowly coming out of her shell and finding more confidence in who and what she is.  Mr. Grey brings something out in her that she was not aware she had.  Slowly, she finds herself attracted to Mr. Grey and his faults, while Mr. Grey finds that although Lee brings out something in him, he is too conflicted to understand himself.  He too cares for Lee, who helps him fulfill his needs, yet he feels disgusted because of what he does.

Then the day comes along in which Mr. Grey decides he cannot continue to live like this - he feels that if Lee does not go, he will not be able to stop engaging in the activity that he, as employer and Lee, as employee, partake.  The movie climaxes here and finds two souls lost until they found each other, broken apart.  What happens to them?  What happens to Peter?  I'm not going to divulge any more of this movie as I'm sure I have gone on enough, but trust me when I say that this is a must-see movie.  You may not like it, or you might, but just watch it.

But it came the unexpected . This movie pretends to be a funny story but without a clear sense of disturbance and mistery . The characters are not depicted deeply . They are like human puppets both of them are shy but loosers too each one in their emotional circle . Both of them are isolated persons and they like the cat and mouse game . But the movie turns around a set of vignettes of ancient archetypes previously told in a most effective way .

I may suggest three remarkable films : Sumision , Belle de jour and Night porter where there is substance beyond the distorted behavior .

The film is extremely flat and nothing is left to the imagination . So you kill the erotism .

And finally the film makes its last round and tries to become in a very special love story .

The film runs at half road between the comedy and the tragedy to finnish not being neither one nor another .

I can't quite explain it but I found myself quite aroused by the spanking scences, and looking forward with great anticipation for the next time Mr. Grey brought out his red pen!! I really liked this movie because it doesn't try and cure Lee of her love of pain, but rather it show that it can be a natural and an erotic part of life. So to all the people out their who are into S&M don't be ashamed of it, enjoy it all that you can, and believe me im sure there are others out their who share your love of pain/pleasure too!!",1093564800,10,698,3.992857142857143
1840172,5,B00008DDSC,"As a feminist, the themes presented in this film were not my cup of tea...so I feel kind of awkward and embarrassed saying that I really enjoyed SECRETARY. I won't go into detail about plot and such, because it has all been said in previous reviews, but I will share some of my personal opinions.

This movie is very disturbing, but the two leading players are fascinating to watch. I am a huge fan of James Spader, and he just shines in these kind of ""twisted"" roles. He is definitely one of the world's greatest actors and this is one of his best performances. (Even though all of his performances are top-notch)! And Maggie Gyllenhaal is absolutely fantastic as well! She is obviously a very talented actress with a lot of guts. I give her a lot of credit for taking a role that many women wouldn't touch. The only real qualm I have with this film is that it could have gone into a little more detail about Mr. Grey's past and why he behaves the way he does. It didn't provide enough information about his character's previous exploits.

Another thing about this film that makes it unique is the way that it is able to be flat-out sexy without a lot of actual sex. The tensions between the two characters are so complex and I was always wondering what they would be feeling (and doing!) next. Seriously, the sexual tension in several of the scenes is so thick that you can cut it with a knife (this is especially true with the spanking scene). And you just gotta love those red Sharpies! Also, the musical score is terrific and highly seductive.

Overall, this is a great film and it was interesting to see a different kind of love lifestyle (although it is one that I would never pursue myself)! The ending is touching and it was good to see how these two people finally came together and shared some gentle, caring and tender moments. I am not a big fan of nudity in movies, but the scenes in this film were done in an artistic, respectful and beautiful way.

I have watched this movie several times already, but nothing compares to the experience of seeing it for the very first time. Initially, I found this film to be shocking and even mildly disgusting. After thinking about it for a little while, however, I grew to realize what a fine independent picture SECRETARY is...and now I love it! I highly recommend this film, but not for individuals who are closed-minded about this kind of subject matter. For mature, open-minded viewers, this movie is a must!",1092528000,11,2465,4.520179372197309
1840173,5,B00008DDSC,"I saw this on HBO in the middle of the night while on vacation, and was very surprised at the depth covered in this movie. Lee is a very disturbed young woman searching for control over her life. Her actions - the self-inflicted pain, the cutting, are all symptoms of trying to gain control when so much of her life to this point has been horribly insecure. Enter Mr. Gray, her neurotic attorney boss, who is drawn to her in a way that frightens him. He also has a problem with control, and is tediously exacting in his work and in his exercise. I loved the scene where he tells her, ""you are never to harm yourself again."" Apparently Lee, fresh from the world of well-meaning psychologists, has never been ordered to cease the self-harming behavior. Mr. Gray steps into the role of master and Lee begins to blossom. Lee begins to walk home, on the order of Mr. Gray, and feels more confidence as she imagines him beside her, protecting her.  The relationship continues with Mr. Gray exacting mild punishment over her small mistakes.  They are both playing a game with each other, becoming wrapped up in it. Until Mr. Gray, disgusted with himself and the escalation of their encounters, fires Lee. Again, he is attempting to get control over himself.  As he says to her when she confronts him, ""We can't do this 24 hours a day, 7 days a week!"" It turns out that that is, indeed, what they both need. I thought the needs they both had were very well expressed in the scene where Lee confesses to cutting herself.

I can see how this film got its R rating, but it still goes about presenting this material it in a almost tame manner.

She does a typing course and takes a job as a secretary to eccentric lawyer E. Edward Grey (James Spader).  She finds his exacting demands to her liking, and blossoms in his employment.  Thier mutual attraction is obvious.  She even acquires a nice but slightly wet boyfriend.  Then one night E. Edward Grey sees her flirting with her boyfriend in the launderette (American launderettes seemm to be much more glamorous than British ones) this sets off feelings of jealousy that leads to his fury at her spelling mistakes and the now-famous (and very sexy) spanking scene.  Their relationship blossoms and becomes more and more kinky (there is a wonderful scene where he puts a saddle on her and a carrot in her mouth and you can see the expression of absolute relish on her face).  But he is unable to cope with their growing intimacy and backs off, he starts treating her, as she remarks in disgust ""just like a regular old secretary"", even when, in desperation, she empties all her tipp-ex into the river.  Nice but wet boyfriend wants to marry her, and it looks for a while as if she is going to, but it's really Mr. Grey that she wants, and she is determined to do everything she can to get him.  This is an absolutely wonderful film.

1840178,5,B00008DDSC,"A quirksome little film focusing on the sublimated dominance / submission dynamic between the secretary and her boss. A girl fresh out of college takes on a job at an attorney's office where the two work out their latent sado-masochistic tendencies upon each other, and what may actually occur if certain business policies were not enforced. It  speaks to the fact that indulgence does indeed occur in office buildings frequently, for they are caves of the humanimal beast of the field after all, and nature will out no matter the environment.
 Here, it all starts with a typo - typo turns into `misbehavior', and eventually misbehavior turns into punishment  - a literal spanking ponderously administered which thereby evolves into all manner of colloquial humiliation and command mutually indulged, to the point where she would not even eat if it were not with his permission - and she was perfect - indeed, herself becoming her own little ""Miss Behavior"", at times purposefully mis-spelling a word, just to enjoy her grateful punishment at the hands of her domineering Master. It becomes so much a part of her sexuality, as she derived her E.C.I. with that first spanking, and reaches climax every time.
 But one day, the pleasures cease as abruptly as they began, to her profound disappointment, and she begs for her sweet punishments again. She attempts all of the usually methods of seduction - from gifts to cards to flowers, to a plunging neckline, but to no avail. Until finally, she realizes that she must do something `naughty' to attract his attention, subsequently a large worm in his mail, to which he draws a thick red line around it to mark her error, as he had been doing prior all along, like the authority figure she craves. This causes a reaction that was most unexpected indeed, as he satisfies himself with just the view of her bent over with her skirt hiked up and pantyhose pulled down. Finally, she is fired because he does not fully comprehend the sub/dom dynamic himself, and  henceforth abruptly fires her, leaving her isolated from the one she loves, despite the amorous attentions she derives from some spineless loser she had been seeing, whom she was about to actually marry, until her desperate passion eventually bade her to return to the office again at the last moment, where she proclaims her love for him. At first he seeks to remove her, but she remains adamant so he finally issues a command, that she remain at the table with her hands flat thereupon where he leaves her for three days during which she is ""counseled"" by friends and even clergy to cease, yet her love-filled determination bids her onwards. He finally releases her from her long-suffering, and carries her to a bathtub where he bathes her and loves her until she becomes his wife.
 So here we have seen the subconscious covert, transforming to overt expressions made with artistic license to cinematically exemplify the underlying relationship between boss and secretary, sexually subjectified, although such a scenario does carry strains of actuality, and is feasible after all, as relative to the D/s Lifestyle, and is portrayed quite well with the psychological fetish play.
 The film begins rather innocuously, becoming more and more interesting, building to a crescendo in the middle, drops off in disappointment, then gradually builds up again unto a most pleasing ending. Her infatuation and subsequent love is impressive overall, and they are both rewarded in the end.",1084752000,13,3483,4.974226804123711

I know that James Spader, one of my favorite actors, often chooses odd vehicles to showcase his talents, so I decided to give the movie a chance.
I am glad that I did because it was well worth viewing, in my opinion. Strange? yes. Disturbing? yes. Pornographic? no. It is a funny and oddly tender movie...a different kind of love story. But because it is different, is it wrong? I don't think so.
There is a lot of emotional pain in this movie, shown brilliantly by Maggie Gyllenhaal's character, Lee (just out of a mental hospital), who goes to work for the emotionally closed-off lawyer, E. Edward Grey (Spader), a man with many fetishes, obviously an odd duck. Before long, Lee has become the object of one of these fetishes...and she finds herself excited more than she has ever been.

Fortunately, sometimes appears a movie that tries to add something new and original to this limited genre, offering innovative perspectives. ""Secretary"" is one of those rare films, which actually dares to bring a breath of fresh air and add a couple of different concepts. Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader (both perfect in their roles)star as the offbeat and twisted couple who shares a weird connection, going beyond the typical and distant boss/ employee relationship. Steven Shainberg`s directing debut is an interesting and compelling indie cinematic experience, one that wisely combines dark humour, S&M, romance, dramatic tension and also works as an intriguing character study. However, the ending is a bit disappointing, since it presents a somewhat standard and expected resolution, similar to the romantic comedies it tries to satirize. Still, ""Secretary"" is innovative enough for the most part, making for a solid and recommended effort.

And that's what I think this film accomplishes the very best-taking ""wierd"" people that in the cinematic world (and unfortunately in the real one too)are either ignored, or made fun of, and it fleshes them into real people. Real people that you can like,admire,and respect. It shows us that despite their ""alternative"" lifestyles, they are people not much different from your average joe. I walked away from this film with admiration for how sensitively the subject of s&m was handled. Usually, it's a great opportunity for ridicule, but here, the characters were CHARACTERS, and not caricatures. You walk away from this film feeling warm, and delighted, not uncomfortable like you may assume.
The pacing is perfect, and Maggie Gyllenhaal's performance was simply excellent and totally transforming. A truly magical role that lit up the screen, I truly felt she was this girl. James Spader also worked well as Gyllenhaal's crazed,neurotic boss.

Soon, she's doing more than typing for him, and he's helping her come out of her reclusive shell.
This film on paper sounds almost exactly like ""The Piano."" A young woman is given the choice between a conventional relationship and one that superficially might seem perverse, and opts for the perverse one. In both films, what no-one in the heroine's sphere understands is that the man she's involved with is appealing because he's the only one who seems to understand what she needs.
""Secretary"" is not as sombre as ""The Piano,"" however, though it's not as rowdy as the premise might lead you to believe.  It's actually a quite substantive film and only occasionally did I think it faltered somewhat in telling its story (particularly toward the end, when Lee embarks upon her hunger strike).  Ironically, in offering herself up for submissive humiliation from her boss, Lee finds the strength she needs to face her own demons and forges a confidence she's never before had.
Gyllenhall is spectacular, and gives one of those performances that should put her on the map as a serious actress, if anyone is paying attention.  Spader is pretty good too, but he's upstaged by Gyllenhaal, who owns this movie.

1840188,4,B00008DDSC,"This is a peculiar black comedy about a subject matter that has been approached in cinema before, but not in such an open and healthy manner. Sadism and masochism are subjects usually left for films about serial killers, sociopaths or the underworld of freaks. In cinema, at least, this topic, and the issues it raises about human sexuality, human suffering and the notion of power and dominance, has been for the most part, taboo, and it is a step in the right direction for the industry to present it in such a fresh, open and humorous way.
Lee (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a young woman with a few issues about herself and her family. The film opens with her leaving an institution, and her therapist wishing her well in the outside world. We come to see that Lee uses pain as a coping mechanism - burning and cutting herself when life becomes too difficult. She learns some office skills at the community college and lands a job at a one-man law firm. Edward Grey (James Spader) is not what one would say is your `normal' employer. When we first meet him in the interview scene, one gets the immediate impression that this man has a few issues of his own. As the story begins to unfold, however, one can see that these two unique individuals just might have something in common. This becomes all too apparent in the scene where he `punishes' her for making too many typos in her letters. Personally, I didn't know whether to be shocked or laugh during this scene, and ended up quite stunned and laughing at the same time. It would have been extremely difficult to pull off this particular scene without losing its underlying power, as it demands both comedy and depth, but Spader and Gyllenhaal made it real, funny and powerful in every sense.
~ Secretary~ is to a large extent a coming of age film. Here is a young, obviously intelligent and sensitive woman, discovering aspects about herself that are not necessarily `normal' to our middle-of-the-road sensibilities. She meets someone who makes her aware about herself, and at the same time, she makes him aware that love can exist and be expressed without feeling guilt. This is a love story though a kind of love story one does not hear about very often. `Secretary~ is a funny, odd and entertaining film.",1075593600,2,2257,4.659147869674185

The newcomer, Maggie G., has a breakthrough performance.  The movie opens on a sad, pathetic looking girl and ends with a strong, assertive woman who is beautiful and knows what she wants.
As with any relationship of this type, from the outside we see the dominant as being in charge.  But looking closer and some of Maggie's characters actions at the end of the film, we see the submissive is actually pulling the strings - getting what she wants and needs out of the relationship.

Given the perversions and unusual proclivities of both Gyllenhaal's ""Lee"" and her boss, played by an old hand at this sort of bizarre role, James Spader, the ending was somehow... a little too normal. There is entertainment value in this film, and the viewer can see a change in the dynamics of the relationship between Lee and boss in the film. (At least this is how I interpreted it). Lee's self-esteem was not the highest nor her mental state the best when she started working in the law office in which Spader is a lawyer. However, she appears to grow more confident and validated by Spader's control over her, while he grows more and more doubtful and begins questioning the relationship.",1075161600,3,871,4.8133333333333335

But I will tell you what I got from this movie. Secretary was by far one of the best movies I have watched in a very long time if not ever. I've found myself to be a huge fan of Maggie Gyllenhaal & James Spader... Although I have been a huge fan of James Spader from movies like Stargate, The Stickup, Tuff Tuff, Crash, and many others... I left this movie with a lot of things. But the biggest one was a new huge curiosity of the BDSM lifestyle. I've never been curious of alternate lifestyles or relationships until seeing this movie, or maybe I have and this movie has just brought it to light. For whatever the reason I know I'm now very much so attracted to the lifestyle. This movie has actually given me a true representation of this lifestyle, almost a look on the inside in ways.. I have now looking back on the movie and knowing what I know now about the lifestyle found a lot of the movie to be true look at this hidden or somewhat unknown culture and lifestyle. I for one thank Steven Shainberg for his directing in this great movie and give it 2 thumbs up. A must in any great dvd collection.",1074902400,2,1236,4.154166666666667

1840194,4,B00008DDSC,"Secretary is indeed an oddity.  A watchable engaging one, but nevertheless an oddity.
I suppose Steven Shainberg has taken a difficult subject and humanized it quite nicely.  Lee Holloway, played deftly by Maggie Gyllenhaal, has a self-deprecating personality that she takes out upon herself in careful sharp and cutting means.  It doesn't seem too healthy and may be disturbing by the general Joe and Jill Q. Public to watch.  E. Edward Grey, also well-played, by James Spader, is a neat-freak lawyer that seems equally isolated and disturbed.  Just about all the characters in this flick (and they aren't many), have issues of the emotional kind.
Though it might not be a film for everyone, in the end we know the twisted people and oddly enough find them human wanting in the needs that all human want, connection, meaning, compassion.  It is odd that it comes to this.
Don't miss the belly-aching laugh of Gyllenhaal's character attempting to delve into the world of S&M by throwing tomatoes at a furtive and bound soul (bound to a oven no less).  It is a hoot.
If your squeamish or your taste are on the slightly prude side, steer clear of Secretary.  If not, and you possess an open-mind, by all means give Secretary a watch.  You will find it less about S&M and more about a character study of the human condition.

1840195,4,B00008DDSC,"American movies about personalities are relatively rare, since the focus is rather on the subject. This one is a fine materialization about weird, yet lovely people.
James Spader taking the role of a yellow man, with all the cynical characters that you might find in a lawyer, as if he was born to play such role, and Maggie Gyllenhaal, the sweet beautiful young actress, is amazing in the role of an accidental secretary.
Both personalities have strange alienations, maneuvering the sexual (or sensual) relation between them, and developing it based on the courage and tenacious of revealing, though discretely, the freaky approach to interactive with the other became a masterpiece.
The movie starts with an invitation by Edward (the lawyer) to Lee (the secretary) to the world of submission that found a receptive answer; the sequences of the movie show the development of an S/M relation in a smart funny way, never boring or exaggerating. The scenes are not explicit to the extent of being offensive to normal viewer, because the movie concentrates on the buildup of the relation so you amazingly find yourself watching the hot succession of a love story. Moreover, pushing things to the limits is something usual in such relations, and it has been presented in a very logic way in the film. The determined sacrifices of the sub (Lee) as the last showdown, replied to by the complicated hesitation of the top (Edward) push the revelation to the ultimatum: we love each other this way.
I really loved this movie, found it very spicy and colorful. With the new wave in cinema, were cost, graphic and technology rating the film and attracting the fans, it is so hard to provide such intentionally (definitely not compulsory) low budget, well made and extremely rich film.
One minor non-avoidable defect: the joy of watching it for the first time is not repeatable, so if you want to own it, it would be simply for it existence among the collection to remind you about a warm sweet experience.",1074124800,10,1994,4.884955752212389

1840197,5,B00008DDSC,"Based on Mary Gaitskill's stort story collected in ""Bad Behavior,"" ""Secretary"" follows a very, very strange kind of love story between a young girl Lee Holloway and a middle-aged lawyer E. Edward Grey who employs her as, yes, a secretary.  Lee is played by splendid Maggie Gyllenhaal (Jake's sister), and Edward by James Spader, who is simply great.  You also see Jeremy Davis and Lesley Ann Warren, but their roles are not as big as the two leads.
The story is simple; it revolves around the said two characters, and the unexpected romance between them.  I said 'romance,' but it is a kind of romance you find in cult-film directors like David Lynch (whose influence is too obviously felt here, and the music here is by Angelo Badalamenti).  Kinky, you might say, and you are right.
Lee, who has a habit of cutting her body, decides to work as a secretary when she finds a vacancy in Edward's office.  But the job meeting with Edward is far from normal.  I won't write it for it is probably the kind of the question many people think most indecent, and sexually harrassing.
But Lee takes the job, and surprisingly, gradually gets a better secretary under the very 'unique' guidance of Edward, who tells her the 'right' way of doing the jobs.  But when their mutual feelings comes closer to love, teacher/student relation also comes close to ""Bad Behavior,"" or very sadomasochistic love relation between them.
You may think, if you read this, the film is repulsive.  Surely, to some, it may be.  As I said, films like David Lynch or Pedro Almodobar can be the touchtone.  If you love them, try it.  If you prefer old-fashioned way of exressing love (which I do not dislike either), you may be shocked to see it.
James Spader is always at his best when he portrays this kind of a character with intelligence and repressed desire, as you saw in ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape.""  He is as good as that, but more astonishing is the newcomer Maggie Gyllenhaal, who succeeds in displaying the natural transformation of a girl -- a girl to a woman.  No one can deny her enormous talent without which the film could be very simplistic exploitation of sexual desire.
However, the fact is, it is not.  And the two main characters are realized with compassionate touch of the director.  I like them; I understnd them; only that possibly I cannot follow the path they went.",1073692800,8,2356,4.657004830917875

If you have a hard time understanding a lifestyle that differs from your own, not a movie for you.  Unless your lifestyle involves your average S&M activities, then definately movie for you.  Or if you're just open minded.  I guess this film gave me a better understanding of someone who is into S&M and I actually respect their motives.  It's all about happiness.  And this film really showed this and did a great job at it.  James Spader acted really well in this, but was definately overshadowed by Maggie Gyllenhaal.  She impressed me beyond words.",1073433600,3,709,4.6
1840199,1,B00008DDSC,"The mostly stellar reviews that this movie received, and my love of independent movies over summer blockbusters made this movie a must see on my list. When I started to watch this movie I immediately felt that it would be of those that would polarize its audience due to the subject matter and execution thereof, but I hoped that I would be on the side of those who liked it.
I was shocked only by how bored I was by watching this movie. The movie was marketed as a walk on the wildside of sorts and I kept waiting for it to get going. After watching half of it, I simply could not waste another minute.
The only positive thing that this movie accomplished was to allow Maggie Gyllenhaal the room to give a deeply immersed, credibly transitional performance as Lee, a fragile, frumpy, self-mutilating psychiatric patient recently released from a mental hospital. Her performance has to be considered a true breakthrough as she managed to give some humanity and believability to a heavy-handed yet underwritten script.
Other actors don't come out nearly as well. James Spader, who plays Lee's boss seems to be phoning in his performance as he is no different here than he is in the television show titled ""The Practice"". Spader's acting works very well in the series as he is part of an ensemble and his character has brought life to a series that was getting stale. Here he just annoys. Also, does the director not know that casting Leslie Ann Warren alsmost guarantees a dud. She unfortunately is an actress who like Spader seems to be playing the same angry victim every time she appears in a movie. This role may say a lot about the opportunities that are out there for mature women, but she does nothing to make it her own.
Although the director has a visual flair, the pacing of the movie killed it for me. The multiple scenes involving self-mutilation were treated frivolously and Lee's submission into the sadomasochistic relationship did not ring true to me. Although I like quirky movies, the repeated spankings seemed way out of place and the movie would have benefitted from a more restrained approach. I believe that it could have worked much better if it had taken the time to seduce the audience into seeing how Lee could be attracted by what was about to come. The execution could have benefited by creating a sense of mystery and not being so in your face with what seemed to be very violent spankings for the sake of being provocative.
Most will probably disagree with my views about this movie, but I owe my peers the courtesy of putting my two cents to balance the decisions of those who discover movies in this great site. Also, some may say that only seeing half the movie does not allow for a thorough review, but it got to the point when I was too bored and uninterested to watch. This is huge when you consider that I have only walked out of two movies in my whole life.
In a nutshell, this movie seems to be asking us to view the lead characters' kinkiness not as some innocuous behavioural difference but as a profoundly liberating statement. The statement is too bold and the movie in no way reaches the heights it intends too. Maybe this would work better as a documentary, but this film is a waste of time and money.",1072915200,29,3245,4.567753001715266
1840210,5,B00008DDSC,"This is an extraordinary movie.  Anybody can watch it, male or female.  I enjoyed Maggie Gyllenhaal's acting more than anything.  This movie caused me to have a crush on her!  The genre can best be described as a Dark Romantic Comedy.  James Spader is great with his fidgeting and yelling.  The DVD presents the film in a widescreen format.  The extras include the original theatrical trailer of the film which is cool to watch, a 7 minute behind-the-scenes featurette with interviews with the director and cast, a photo gallery, and audio commentary from Director Steven Shainberg and writer Erin Cressida Wilson.

1840211,5,B00008DDSC,"If you come to Secretary expecting a raunchy comedy full of short skirts and spanking, then you'll be disappointed.  If, however, you're a fan of offbeat movies with wonderfully drawn characters then this is definitely worth a look.  The story has sado-masochist, withdrawn Lee (Gyllenhaal) take up a job as secretary at the offices of Edward Grey (Spader), a bullying depressive lawyer.  As the relationship grows in intensity, spanking included, both Lee and Grey wonder how they can unite their inner turmoil to the way the other makes them feel.
The acting is brilliant.  Gyllenhall really proves that she has what it takes to be an actress of her generation, easily overtaking other talented competition from Kirsten Dunst and Reese Witherspoon.  Clearly a beautiful young woman she manages to hold herself in such a way as to make her appear the most dumpy, boring, painfully shy girl you'd ever come across.  Sister to Donnie Darko star Jake, she clearly proves herself just as worthy of acclaim as her sibling.  Spader takes a pretty similar role to that he had in Crash a few years ago, though here he adds in a kind of profound depression into his bullying ways and really sparkles with his co-star.
When reviews say this isn't a movie for everyone, that's true.  A lot of people like their love stories straightforward, and this is anything but.  Laced with dry humour Secretary traces one of the year's most delicate, beautiful relationships as Lee and Grey find in each other exactly what they'd never realised they'd needed their whole lives.  The ending will leave you with exactly the right amount of hope for love in a world where only loneliness and self harm seem to be the answer for its characters.

1840212,1,B00008DDSC,"I had high hopes for this movie, clearly too high.  As a fan of spanking in real life, watching this movie was painful, and not in a fun way.  The two characters in this story are so psychologically messed up that it removes any eroticism the teasers and trailers suggest.  This is one of those movies where the trailers were better than the movie.
 The secretary Lee, played by Gyllenhaal, plays the part of the abused child very well, so well that I feel sorry for her and wish she would really get therapy.
 James Spader, plays Edward, the lawyer who hires Lee, and he is a very odd lawyer indeed.  He only uses a typewriter, and loves red pens.  This would be perfect for us spanking fans, but he plays the role neurotic, not erotic.  I wish he would get some therapy as well!
This movie was a dud in my mind and if you think this would be a good spanking intro movie - DO NOT DO IT.  It's a better movie for people learning to be therapists than for spanking fans.  They could have made both characters less psychologically damaged, more real, and had some real fun with the movie.  Instead I felt sorry for both characters and cringed because those that do see this movie will probably think anyone who likes spanking has real problems.
Good acting (too good almost), good premise but a dud in terms of the writing and the characters.  I felt sorry for both Edward and Lee and the ending was so unreal as to make the movie a joke.",1071792000,20,1436,4.317164179104478

It makes you want to roll over and get your butt slapped.  Until the end that is.  Then the filmmakers tank the whole film by forcing it to fit within the boring Hollywood convention of a love story.  They even use reporters in the film, not to make a statement on our over powering draw to the media (especially to see the foreign and uncomfortable), but to make the interviewee's statement grounded in normality.

This movie is about sex, but it's also about repression and shame for having deviant thoughts. These people are interesting not because of the sex (although it was lovingly, beautifully depicted in kinky glory), but because they've broken through and discovered their true selves, and put their shame aside.
They've made a hedonist's journey - from being small and ashamed about the body, to enjoying it fully.  I thought it was beautiful - because I think the body's needs are the expression of the true self, and we constantly put up mysterious psychological barriers against them.
First off, what is shame, or modesty?  We form a mental 'box' around our sexuality - I'm not sure why. People don't go naked, even in warmer climates, I suppose because sex is not so distracting and we need a mental space in which to conduct more common social interaction - but that's not the same as shame..
Spader's character was obviously very ashamed of his sexual deviance.  I don't understand this - my sense is that there's only shame if the behavior is harmful to oneself or others - otherwise it's either a curiousity of a person's neurological development, and is either wonderful or a waste of time.  In any case, shame is irrelevant.
Even as I write this I know I couldn't live those words.  Shame, especially the sexual type, is hard-wired - just as much as the pecadillo that caused it.
Here we see Spader break out of his 'shame spiral'(!) and open up, beautifully - into a relationship - kinky but real - instead of his previous forays, which I gather were more of the 'kinky and weird' variety.  His character was stunted and poorly socialized, probably for all sorts of reasons.  His character was forced to change - to heal and become whole.
I thought it was very beautiful to see him open up and trust and allow Maggie into his life.  She forced his hand - and that's necessary - I felt it was beautiful that she cared enough to push him, hard, and take him out of his broken existence.
As for Maggie, she was never really repressed or ashamed about sex - she was more of an invisible person on the periphery of others' lives.  Here we see her gain enormous power through this newfound Kink, and her love allows her to break through her follower-mentality and become a real person - with a will of her own. They open up together and become new people who can enjoy their bodies and live life to the fullest.  I thought this was a terrific movie - a rarity in that it's about sex, and is not aimed at 15-year-olds, and pulls so few punches. Usually only the French produce such films.
Maggie is wry and sharp, and easy on the eyes - I couldn't take mine off her - she's a star from this day forward.",1071619200,6,2947,4.489719626168224
1840217,5,B00008DDSC,"Secretary is an excellent potrayal of fantasies and desires and fetishes one can't speak in words. Maggie Glynnenhall does an excellent job as the shy and mildly confused Lee who is taken in as a Secretary. Simple conversations turn into deep truth games, where dark secrets are spilled between Lee and the boss. He helps her cope with an obsession with injection and cutting herself. Soon, this turns into even more when the boss' obsession with  typos turns into a kinky world of spanks, chains, and moist succulent fun. Secretary bring what other movies revolving around this subject cannot; charm, wit, and beautiful grotesque scenes between the boss and Lee. Lee's life to the viewer is alost pathetic, who lives with her parents and dates a poor man.

It's use of S&M is far more subtle and, for lack of a better word, likable, than I expected.  If you're a bit squeamish and uneasy at the idea of S&M being a potent ingredient in the movie you're about to watch, I would still recommend ""Secretary.""
It's about a slightly unbalanced girl (Maggie Gylenhaal, in a very vulnerable, but strong peformance) who, upon coming home from a mental institution, is pushed to get a job.  She's very shy, but James Spader's character is attracted to that, against his will, and hires her.  What follows is the story of their attraction to each other and the needs that each one fulfills in the other.  The S&M element is not overblown and is not shown in a nasty, explicit way.  Rather, you see it as just one of the things that gives them an understanding.
This is a funny, though still quite dark, love story and by the end of it, you empathize and enjoy the characters, even though they are far from perfect.  This is one of the more realistic versions of true love that I've seen.",1070409600,5,1145,4.423809523809524
1840230,4,B00008DDSC,"The Secretary alternately shocks and surprises us with its unusual subject matter and intense approach to its off-beat subject.  Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Lee Holloway, a young girl just released from a mental institution who is determined to get a job.  She notices a sign posted outside a lawyer's office for a secretary.  As she enters the office she watches the former holder of this job leaving in tears.  She then introduces herself to Mr. Grey, the lawyer, ably played by James Spader.  Mr. Grey's office is the first clue that something unusual is in store for her.  Rare flowers are beautifully showcased in an exotic setting.  Additionally, the lawyer appears to have a fetish for neatness.  He quickly removes from sight a row of carefully arranged markers.
Lee gets the job and begins her initiation into a new world of strange and bizarre behavior.  Lee has a habit of punishing herself for real and imagined faults.  We watch her in the bathroom of her home cutting herself.  She has scars all over her body from past abuse.  She soon begins to cut herself in the office and is noticed by her boss.  At first he says nothing, but when she makes a variety of errors on the reports she is assigned to type, he yells at her and then takes sterner measures.  He tells her to come into his office and then demands that she lean over his desk and place her palms on the desk surface.  She complies and is spanked by the the lawyer.  She submits to this indignity and even seems to like it.  Lawyer and secretary enter into a relationship which allows each to satisfy their deep need to hurt and be hurt.
The secretary falls in love with her boss and tells him so.  He is unable to respond to her affections and fires her.  Like Bartelby the Scrivener, she prefers not to be fired and visits him at his home and then takes up residence in the office.  She comes to the attention of the media who publicize her unusual actions. The relationship between lawyer and secretary improves and deepens when he observes her commitment to him.  The climax of the film is both unexpected and original, as is the entire movie.
For those new to the sado/masochistic world, this film is disturbing, yet fascinating.  What motivates these people to act as they do?  The movie does not answer this perplexing question.  Instead, it allows us to draw our own conclusions as we watch each new development in the story.  For those willing to suspend the first inclination to judge the lawyer and secretary as just plain crazy, a deepening understanding of the variety of human experience reveals itself.  We observe the various ways these people respond to the pain they suffer in their lives.
The limited spectrum of what we believe to be normal behavior is stretched considerably with each new development of the story.  I was reminded of The Piano Teacher, a much better film on this subject of sado/masochism that I reviewed some months ago.  The Secretary is not up to the high standard of The Piano Teacher, but still worth recommending.",1070064000,5,3029,4.653483992467043

After 45 minutes or so, you think you're watching some French psychosexual drama. Then the end of the movie comes, and you find out you've been watching a really good chick flick! Underneath the spicy perversion is a straight-up made-for-each-other love story, and a really good one.
The heart of this movie is a truly incredible performance by Maggie Gyllenhaal, whose shy, crooked smiles come off like a deeply repressed Meg Ryan. She is absolutely stunning in this role. The script and directing are merely okay, but she carves a perfect shining jewel of a performance out of a solid rock of material. Her mere presence in any future films will make me take notice! If she starts getting heavier roles, she could turn into another Meryl Streep - her performance reminded me in many ways of Sophie's Choice, despite the much milder source material.
James Spader performs his typecast repressed pervert role (Sex Lies and Videotape, Crash) with his normal mumbling flair. It's not that he's a bad actor, it's just that Maggie Gyllenhaal is so much better. He does his part to move the film along and provide the appropriate friction for her to form a character against. Jeremy Davies and Lesley Ann Warren do well as representatives of the life Lee needs to escape.
Anyway... if you want a good, dopey love story and aren't afraid of a LOT of kink, and want to see an up-and-coming actress before she starts getting Oscars (she absolutely deserved an Oscar nomination for this role), watch it. But if the idea that sadomasochism can be a form of love for the repressed offends you or freaks you out, go rent something with Meg Ryan instead.",1069804800,13,1747,4.731147540983606

The story centers around Lee played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who comes out of a psychiatric hospital for a compulsion to self mutilate and hurt herself, on top of having to live in a home were her dad can be an ugly drunk and a hapless overly codependent mother played by Leslie Ann Warren .  Upon her release from the hospital she plunges herself into her secretarial school where she excels and upon completion of her studies she applies for a position with a small legal office with Edward(James Spader),a rather perfectionist and imperious lawyer who tends to run secretaries out of his office.  He observes her and in some ways helps her, but becomes rather severe over typos due to having no computers and typewriters being the only way to make documents.
At first he admonishes her then it graduates to spankings.  However once he knows of her self mutilation habit he orders her to stop to which she complies.  In a way it becomes a love story and who is to really say that love must always be soft and gentle and that submissibity and domination don't turn some people's cookie.  Won't give away more otherwise it gives away too much, it is different I will say that.",1069027200,,1249,4.553571428571429
1840234,5,B00008DDSC,"Sexuality has forever played a tremendous role in our storytelling.  In recent years, those roles and themes have become more visible, controversial and erotic.  Where censorship strives to dismiss controversy, ""Secretary"" embraces it and offers us an unforgetable tour of the taboo.
""Secretary"" forces us to look outside of the box - and see through the eyes of Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal).  Lee is of a unique breed, who gets pleasure from pain and finds security out of being submissive.  Lee returns home for her sister's wedding after having spent time in a mental patient facility.  We are immediately find out she is a cutter and inflicts wounds of all sorts for a sense of relief.  Determined to not spend all her time at home with her dysfunctional family, she gets a job working as a secretary in a law office for E. Edward Grey (James Spader).  Grey is an abrasive anal-retentive man who apparently runs through secretaries every few months or so.  We soon witness his growing infactuations with Lee and through his mood swings and psuedo-violent behaviors, a strange sort of romance develops between them.  He begins to abuse her and as these habits become more severe, she looks for more ways to receive abuse.  Lee must then balance her two seperate lives, living with her family/exploring a relationship with a childhood boyfriend and the taboo S&M relationship she carries with her employer.  Both worlds,of course, interfere with each other, ultimately ending with a final confrontation and a surprise ending.
Maggie Gyllenhaal has proven herself to be a superb actress.  Her character seems so real in all her actions - there is nothing campy about her subtle nature and her excitement's crescendos.  Though her role is small in this feature, Leslie Ann Warren lends her usual charismatic prescence as Lee's over protective suburban mother.  James Spader is surprisingly cold and calculated in all of his antics.  Each expression on his face becomes immaculately complex, as to which we must question what is going through his head as he spanks his ""helpless"" employee leaning over his desk.
One must remember that this movie relys on exposing the dark side of sexuality.  Full female nudity, masturbation and sex is blunty displayed in a few scenes.  What makes this art instead of smut is the underlying emotional states of the characters.  One can only hope to find some understanding of their psychology and desires.  Because of how controversial the subject matter is, this movie is not for everyone.  And I think that might be a reason I love it so much!",1068768000,3,2583,4.962790697674419

Edward soon finds out that Maggie has a secret: she's a cutter, who deals with her emotional pain by inflicting physical pain on herself. Edward takes control of the situation, and helps Lee replace her cutting with a full-blown S&M relationship with him.

1840250,5,B00008DDSC,"I suppose I should be wracked with feminist guilt for enjoying SECRETARY as much as I did, but instead I must rave about the amazing performances of Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader. This film frankly tackles sexuality, gender, age and experience as they relate to power and control, in fairly explicit terms.
I'm a big James Spader fan from way back. I have a great soft spot for his gloriously self-indulgent 'Yuppie scum' performances from The Brat Pack years, elements of which are seen here along with significant influence of his roles in SEX LIES AND VIDEOTAPE and WHITE PALACE.
Spader's E. Edward Grey is obsessed with big red Sharpie markers, orchids, humane mousetraps and sugary coffee. And spanking, just to name a few things. He's created a false pastoral environment in his office, carefully watering and feeding his orchids among the sickly green paneling and placing a row of dying houseplants along the dark hallway leading up to his office. The light in the office is murky, giving the impression that nothing could grow there, but could definitely fester.
Maggie Gyllenhaal gives a gutsy performance as Lee Holloway, Mr. Grey's secretary and eventual counterpart in a submissive/dominant relationship. Lee, like Mr. Grey, is delicate and high-strung. We see Lee just released from a six-month stint in an institution to attend her sister's pink, plastic, Florida poolside wedding. She stands apart from both the other guests and her family at the reception, enveloped in an ill-fitting blue dress and the viewer is not surprised when she retreats to her bedroom and methodically begins cutting her thigh.
As Lee and Mr. Grey become drawn to one another, Lee begins evolving into a more confident, attractive woman. Her shapeless clothes and sloppy sweaters are traded in for knee-length skirts, nylons and heels. When Mr. Grey tells her that she doesn't need to cut herself anymore, she actually throws away her implements. She comes to thrive on his attention, starting with his gleeful discovery of typing errors to circle with his red pens and slowly escalating to more explicit behavior.
The biggest surprise of the film lies in the fact that at its core it is a romance. A twisted, non-standard situation, but a romance nonetheless. After much emotional drama these two damaged characters have found kindred, obsessive, kinky, needy souls in one another and you leave the film thinking that they just might be able to make it work.",1064448000,6,2457,5.03931203931204

S&M is defiently something that you could put in that category...but it seemed interesting so I figured it would be something to just watch for the hell of it.  Now in the opening credits I was really expecting a really graphic intense film about wat S&M pertains to, SEX! But I was surprised, sure it did have a wee bit of nudity and some sexual content...but nothing that made you blush horribly and have to hide your eyes (Or as my friend did, turn it off).  I really thought it was a cute romantic comedy that just happend to have some serious issues involved with it.  Defiently a movie I would buy! SO GO RENT IT!!",1063497600,3,776,4.361111111111111
1840253,4,B00008DDSC,"The most important reason to see this movie is to watch Maggie Gylenhaal.  This performance is the reason the word ""incandescent"" exists.  She makes herself totally believable and VULNERABLE throughout.  It is a brave performance.
It's great to see James Spader back in a worthwhile role again.  He's always been an interesting, quirky, charismatic performer.
Spader plays an attorney (who never has any clients, apparently!) who appears to be very shy and socially backward.  He hires Gylenhaal, also shy and socially backward, to be his secretary.  Their relationship slowly turns into one of S&M.  Maggie is the recipient of the humiliations, which she enjoys.
The movie tracks their VERY odd, but oddly touching relationship.  It isn't really a movie about S&M so much as a movie about how two seemingly hopeless individuals can find ""true love.""  In many ways, it is a sweet movie.
An explicit sweet movie, however.  Gylenhaal's character becomes more and more open about her sexuality as the movie progresses, and it becomes more and more explicit.  It's not porn, but it sure isn't for the kids either.
This is not a movie for everyone, but if you are in the mood for something adult, different and brilliantly acted, SECRETARY may be your cup of tea.

1840255,3,B00008DDSC,"Secretary is a 3 1/2 star movie, unfortunatley Amazon doesn't allow one to be so picky and we must choose between 3 and 4 stars.  I enjoyed Secretary a lot while watching it, however I feel it never quite attains 4 star status, although to condemn it to the level of the 3's seems a trifle harsh.
The movie itself suffers from the same indecision.  It is unsure whether to be a campy play on an S&M relationship, or whether to be a serious Solondz-esque examination of the dark side of the suburbs.  In the end it fails to achieve either.  The plot of the movie has been adequately described by other reviewers, and one doesn't want to give too much away.  The movie itself can be split into 3 main sections, which i shall name after the key ideas - Degredation, Devotion and Disgust.
Degredation - The start of the movie revolves around degredation. The central character, Lee, is a self-abuser, freshly released from and institution.  In the minds of the writers, this means she needs a new pastime to stop her from cutting herself. The self bause here though is never shown on screen, making it hard for us to relate to the character - i think this is a cowardly move on behalf of the director. What happened, he didn't want to scare off the suburbanites?  Anyway, while the self abuse is pretty much left to our imagination, we are treated to a full rendition of the flowering relationship between her and her passive/aggressive boss.  Dr Grey is a lawyer with a particularily strong line in tough love, and we get to watch his transformation from a ""Bottom"" to a ""Top"", as he gets over the loss of his previous mistress and sets about enslaving Lee.  To enslave her me must first degrade her, and the most interesting scene in the first 1/3 of the movie occurs when he forces Lee to go dumpster-diving for a document he carelessly threw out.  The juxtaposition of her, in short skirt and high heels, climing into a dumpster and playing in the trash forces him to do some heavy exercise, presumably to punish himself both for the rising sexual urge and for degrading her in the first place.
The themes are expanded in the second third of the movie, which i refer to as Devotion.  Here the lines between their work relationship and master/slave relationship are played out in a series of interesting scenes (her red pen fetish, his all-consuming guilt), and then increasingly blurred as these worlds become inseparable.  All good things must come to an end though, and she has to go and spoil everything by falling in love with him. Chicks, eh? While his revulsion at his own acts causes him to push her away. Men, eh?  This is where the movie works best, exploring the self-destructive streak in all of us in our quest for love, using S&M merely as a metaphor for our own internally paradoxical desires to be in control of our world and hopelessly dependant on someone else.  You could get freudian here and delve into Eodipal undercurrants, but space forbits it here...
I said the end of the movie is characterized by Disgust. That was all mine. Having set up an interesting premise and painted detailed portraits of the human psyche, the film makers run out of ideas and suddenly try to bring the movie to an end as abruptly as possible.  I don't want to ""spoil"" the ending, but it steals from Kafka's ""Hunger Arist"" short story, Tom Robbins' ""Still Life With Woodpecker"" novel and Radiohead's ""Just"" video and in the end plays more like a Renee Zelwegger film, which is ultimately a shame, and reduces the movie to the three star level.
This is one of the sexiest movies i've seen all year - some of the scenes in the middle third are charged with erotic tension without resorting to nudity or even overt sexuality, however in the end (like the movie's best set pieces...) it is ultimately unsatisfying and one is left somewhat unfulfiled.
( As a sidenote, I wonder if genuine S&M afficinados find the premise that one must be disturbed or unhinged to enjoy S&M ill-educated or just insulting...)
A friend of mine saw this movie and walked out halfway though.  I recommend oy uwalk out 2/3 of the way though and leave it perfect in your mind....",1062115200,9,4152,4.582995951417004

1840257,5,B00008DDSC,"This is not necessarily the prurient film it touts itself to be.  I was surprised it was much more serious and much more beautiful - - yes, beautiful - - a story than I had ever anticipated!  This film could easily have become much more twisted and dark (Boxing Helena, anyone?) or much more campy (Frankenhooker), but instead it evolves into an examination of a mutually satisfying relationship - - on an emotional level, even though there is a lot of the physical going on.  There is humor, but it is subtle enough to kind of tickle your brain fleetingly and keep you in the story.  The submission/domination plot line is actually very cerebral.  I think you could actually get two very different movie-going experiences with this film.  One would be a ""oh, what a sweet movie, plus I got some kinky eye-candy to boot"" and the other would be an experience where you recognize symbolism, you examine self-empowerment issues, you mentally debate feminist vs traditional ideals, etc.  But then again, maybe I just think too much!
James Spader (as Edward) is just wonderful at playing this type of character, tortured and mysterious, and Maggie Gyllenhaal (as Lee) very effectively blossoms from beginning to end of the story.  The extraneous characters are developed just enough to give you a good sense of what their roles (dysfunctions and all) are before the story begins, and leaves them at that.  Yes, I had questions but easily let them go.  The true focus is on Lee and Edward.  I must also mention, without actually spoiling the plot for you, the storyline between the pinnacle of the conflict to the ending is just fraught with fantastic symbolism, utilizing nudity, nature, water, light.  It really piqued the intellectual part of my brain.
All in all, I think this movie could be one of my new favorite love stories.  I'm not a fan of the Meg Ryan/Tom Hanks syrupy sweet romantic comedies, but ""Secretary"" was much easier for me to relate to because the characters are so non-perfect.  As a mother, this is not a movie I would be comfortable watching with my children present.  I am not a prude, and certainly not opposed to a good swat on the behind now and then, but there is one scene in particular that would bring up too many questions.

1840258,3,B00008DDSC,"I have to be honest with you all. I've never engaged in deviant sexual behavior. I don't know why? But I guess maybe it's because Hollywood movies try to make that kind of lifestyle seem so silly, or maybe it's cause it hurts to have a whip to your rear, or to get spanked with an open palm. I myself do not enjoy getting spanked but maybe you do! If this is true than Secretary is the kind of movie for you!
Maggie Gyllenhaal (Confessions of a Dangerous Mind) plays Lee Holloway a young woman who has just left a metal institution on the eve of her sisters wedding. She was in there cause she likes to cut herself and when she gets home you understand why. Her father is a viscous drunk and her parent fight all the time. The father is also quite abusive. Poor Lee has nothing else to do but get a job. So when she finds an ad in the paper for a secretary she jumps at the chance.
The job is working for a lawyer named E. Edward Grey (James Spader, Stargate) an interesting cat, whom has a fiery temper and a gentle streak as well. That is until he realizes his attraction to Lee and begins to beat her. Luckily it a sexy beating and she likes it.
Secretary was a film I bought right up until near the end. I began to understand the plight of two people with serious problems to deal with. I think the film is sensitive to their plight. But then there is this scene late in the film where a large crowd gathers around the law firm. I couldn't understand why this scene is necessary. I had hoped it was some wild dream in Lee heads, but no.
That being said I believe Gyllenhaal does an adequate job with Lee. The performance runs the risk of falling into Mira Sorvino lands (a place where you make up a funny voice and that's called acting quirky (see Mighty Aphrodite)) but it doesn't. She has this sense of wonder in her voice, I loved the little scene in the bathtub where she's practicing how to answer the phone, it is just adorable.
Spader's character is good. It's just not drawn well enough. After the film was over I still longed to know what made him tick, I wanted to know what made him hurt, and I wanted to know what causes a successful man to want to dominate women like he did. But the film doesn't like to tell secrets.
There is also a subplot I felt was unnecessary. It concerned Lee and a local boy named Peter (Jeremy Davies, Spanking the Movie) and their sweet little relationship or was it? I guess it was meant to mirror her and Grey's, against her parents. But I don't think it was effective as it should have been. I would zone when Peter arrived on the scene. It's too bad cause I normally like Davies' roles.
Director Steven Shainberg (Hit Me) has crafted an interesting but not terribly compelling story. I can understand how the indi crowd could come to embrace it. It's full of some really original ideas. But the problem with original ideas is if you introduce a less compelling idea it usually falls flat. SECRETARY is still a good movie just not a great one.
I wouldn't force you to become a slave to Secretary, but you'll probably like it anyway.

Definitely not what I expected.. it starts off rather dark and you don't know what to make of Maggie Gyllenhaal ""Lee"" character. I mean she gets out of the mental institution and is still cutting herself. Her home is dysfunctional and Mom is very protective of her (or scared that she will do something drastic to herself again) and her Father is kind of screwed up all on his own. James Spader is just what she needed, and he is just what she needed. :)
James does a wonderful job as the tortured soul in this movie that has to fight himself, when he thinks there is something wrong with what they are doing. The hurt that Lee (Maggie) feels when she is rejected by Spader is so real and painful to see, that you at once realize this as more than just 2 injured people living out there non-traditional sexual desires.
I won't go into the details regarding the plot since it's been done so many times in the reviews before me. I will just say that at the core of this movie is a Man that has some bizarre tendencies and a Woman that has her very real dysfunctional issues. Through their own way and communication they discover a healthy albeit strange Love for one another. It is a rather touching love story in the end... it's just the way they get to it that is rather............. interesting. I know you may read a lot of reviews on this movie that says it's very Sexual... It is but not over whelming... I mean I just saw {Sex and Lucia} and {Y Tu Mama Tambien} which both had a EXTREME amount of sexuality. This one (in my opinion) is more subtle than those two. I can tell you this for a fact you may find yourself coming away from this movie with a different understanding of S&M or of the blurred line between the Dominator and the Sub.
I only recommend it for those that can have a open mind about non-traditional Sex roles or for those that can appreciate a somewhat Twisted movie.

1840268,4,B00008DDSC,"Secretary is a black comedy piece from director Steven Shainberg.  Shainberg previously directed the forgettable ""Hit Me"", and it's clear from this film, that he's growing into his craft.  The film is worthy of the acclaim it received, although it will never be a mainstream favorite.  Both James Spader, who has made a career of quirky parts, and Maggie Gyllenhaal, in her first major role, are outstanding as brooding employer/employee who share a dark secret of dominance.
Lee, Gyllenhaal's character, invented the word dysfunctional, and exhibits destructive behavior, even though she's just been released from a psychiatric care facility.  Lee's a cutter, and just having her back in the house again is upsetting for the rest of her loony family.
The film makes you feel as though you are with Lee, waiting to determine whatever it is in life that could possibly make her happy.  You begin to think she's stumbled into the subservient role as secretary to the tightly wrapped E. Edward Gray, awaiting his commands, whatever they might be.  It is only as the relationship evolves that you can see how much they both gain from it, and how this becomes a romance that perhaps only the two of them can appreciate.  Shainberg's given us a film that is a rich tapestry of color and movement,  he's made us care about his wounded and complex characters, and placed comic touches in a film that doesn't become either voyeuristic or over-the-top with kinky images.
Viewers be warned, there are a number of fetishes played out on the screen, bondage, and nudity.  There probably could have been an NC-17 rating assigned to the film.  But if you skip it, due to this, be aware that you may be missing the beginning of two great careers, those of Shainberg & Gyllenhaal; as well as some of Spader's best work.

Coming home to a timid and nervous mother, it's easy to question how effective her treatment was when she immediately takes shelter in her room and reverently fondles the knives that she's used to cut herself in the past.
She applies for a secretarial job with Edward, a strangely detached attorney played by James Spader (a few years ago this role would have gone to Christopher Walken).  It quickly becomes evident that his performance standards are not necessarily within the norms of conventional office conduct, more apropos of a dungeon than an office.  But Lee discovers a bond (no pun intended) that she had never before imagined, and the interplay between secretary and boss, master and submissive becomes fascinating to watch.  At times it becomes questionable as to who is manipulating who.  But it's clear that these are two very strange personalities that have drifted into a very symbiotic and ultimately beneficial relationship.
If images of sadomasochism and bondage will offend you, stay clear of this.  But for a very complex character study, it's difficult to top.  I can't necessarily say that I would like to have Edward and Lee as next door neighbors, but it is nice that they could find each other.",1058400000,72,1580,5.022988505747127

After spending some time in an instution she attends a community college and then seaks employment and is hired by Mr. Grey as his secretary.
This leads Lee into the journey from darkness into light. Although what she considers light is not the most conventional.

1840286,5,B00008DDSC,"Believe it or not the word that kept coming to mind as I watched ""Secretary"" was ""cute.""  This might strike you as strange given that it is a movie about sadomasochism, but this was the word my wife kept using during the last half of this 2002 film from director Steven Shainberg.  I checked out ""Secretary"" because I heard it was ""quirky,"" which is usually not synonymous with ""cute.""  ""Secretary"" benefits from perfect casting, with James Spader as Mr. Grey, the paralegal, and Maggie Gyllenhaal as Miss Holloway, the titular character.  Obviously, when the word ""cute"" arises it is intended primarily to describe Gyllenhaal, which is important because her character could be written off as a pathetic soul instead of someone who provokes our sympathy (and perhaps our admiration as well).
Miss Holloway has just been released from a mental institution; she likes to cut herself and the last time she went a bit too far.  Now her mother (Lesley Ann Warren) locks up all the knives and the young woman goes off into the world to find her first job.  She has excellent typing scores but there is something else that makes Mr. Grey hire her when she goes to her first interview, and several weeks later when she makes an error on a letter we discover what it is: these two were made for each other and soon Miss Holloway is making mistakes on purpose so that Mr. Grey can discipline her.
There are three things that make this movie work at this point.  The first is that Mr. Grey orders her to stop cutting herself.  Now her pain is going to be administered primarily in terms of spanking, which is nowhere nearly as dangerous as piercing her flesh with sharp objects.  She is, by objective standards, better off under his control.  The second is that Miss Holloway never expresses fear over what she is being asked to do.  Her complete acceptance, combined with the previous point, aid in our acceptance of the situation.  The third is that underneath it all ""Secretary"" is a standard love story.  Two people looking for love find each other and struggle to make a complete connection that will allow them to build a life together.  There are other characters in this film, but they are all minor players in the main drama between Mr. Grey and Miss Holloway.
Long ago we discovered that in a romance film the ""I love you"" line is almost never those three particular worlds.  It is ""Here's looking at you kid,"" ""Where are my slippers,"" or something equally memorable.  ""Secretary"" is no different in that regard, although it is obviously a film where actions speak louder than words.  This is the story of two people who have a love that they are able to make work.  That is nothing to laugh at, and, indeed, the film saves its funniest moments for a time when the relationship has been resolved.  This is, despite expectations to the contrary and the utter surprise of a large portion of the audience, a cute film.
Final note: Make a point of considering how nudity is used in this film.  I think the point in ""Secretary"" in which the nudity becomes more that brief is rather surprising and it made me think about why it was at that particular point it was used.  There is significance to this choice that needs to be appreciated.",1057017600,18,3230,4.621716287215412
1840287,2,B00008DDSC,"I'm going to keep this as short as possible, as I have a tendency to write really long reviews and if I spend too much time expressing disdain for anything I get very depressed.
I was very dissapointed with this movie. I suppose I was deceived by the fact that it was playing at the Angelika when I went to see All the Real Girls (a far better, far sweeter, indie romance). I think this is one of the worst movies I have seen in my life. Director Steven Shainberg uses dull, uncreative angles, which don't help the struggling script. James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal are both very good on their own, but don't work well together. The ""awkward"" pauses between conversation are too long, making it seem like both actors are silently counting to a number before saying their next line. The whole ""love story"" doesn't seem to fit. There is no gradual falling in love between the two throughout the course of the movie. Rather, Lee (Gyllenhaal) runs out of her boyfriends house in her wedding dress and tells Grey (Spader) she loves him. It's as if Shainberg uses it to justify the whole BDSM-thing. He dumps this pseudo-sentimental litter on our laps and expects us to take it. I didn't buy it. This isn't a love story, this is a failed indie romance. We're supposed to feel for the characters, but I don't. They just seem like they're lonely, sad people who can't help themselves.
Controversial movies about the taboos of society can be great, if the director is talented and the screenplay is good. Alas, the director is inexperienced, the script is weak, and the movie suffers for it. Not a good pick for a summer afternoon.",1056672000,2,1625,4.587628865979381

1840289,4,B00008DDSC,"Every once in a while a movie pops up that appears to be... well, a little bit out there. And 'Secretary' is definitely one of those movies. In fact, it's way, way out there. I'd be willing to bet there's a number of other movies like this that are readily available, but probably weren't as publicly observed as this one. I first took note of 'Secretary' when I saw the trailer for it on TV; though I opted to wait a while to rent it. It was certainly worth my time. The duo of Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader is probably the best interaction between two characters in a film I've ever seen. It's been said time and time again how well they light up the screen with their united acting abilities. Let it be known, it is no fluke. Don't be put off by the movie's apparent sexual prowess and provocative demeanor. When it's all said and done the movie becomes more of a romance than the sadomasochistic stomach-aggravator others make it out to be. It's an exceptionally good movie with watertight performances by Gyllenhaal and especially James Spader (a veteran at roles such as this; i.e. 'Sex, Lies, And Videotape').
People like to start by informing [you] that we first see Lee Holloway (Gyllenhaal) being released from a mental hospital. What they forgot to mention is that the very first scene shows Lee walking around a creepy, musty-looking office with a pole handcuffed over her shoulder and to her hands. THEN (six months earlier) we see Lee being released from a mental hospital. After that shocking opening scene the movie is rather straightforward; letting us know through thoughts and actions that Lee's family is the epitome of a dysfunctional family. A drunk father and an overly-protective, abused mother show us just why Lee has a problem with hurting herself. But as society and Lee would like to think, the whole mental hospital thing helped her. When she is debating whether or not to throw out her intriguingly hidden case filled with knives, needles, and ballet dancer dolls, Lee stumbles upon an ad in a paper for a secretary. We then see her crack a timely smile when typing a letter during a session of a typewriting class. So she heads to this office, wanders her way into its lobby and into a room in which E. Edward Grey (Spader) sits, starring complacently into the void. From the start, Edward is a vague and seemingly sinister man. He asks Lee a number of odd questions--that produce some puzzled responses--that you wouldn't normally hear on an interview, and hires her on the spot. Both characters seem to leer and look at one another in a way that is as bizarre as it is comfortable. In other words, it's very obvious they ""like"" each other. The work Lee does is tedious (""very dull"", as Edward remarks); just typing and copying letters and whatnot. So tedious that it allows for Edward to watch over her every move. Like a perverted hawk he studies her movements and yells at her to fix her spelling mistakes. He pushes her, and she just keeps pushing back. Scene after scene you can feel Spader's character falling in love with Lee more and more. But it's not the kind of love you typically see; there's no kissing, no flirting, and hardly any talking. Just a lot of expressions. If you're not paying attention in the same manner Edward watches over Lee, you'll miss everything and the movie will go right over your head. You know all about the spanking that eventually occurs, I'm sure, but I'm glad to see no one made note of how that cultivates. That part is particularly amiable (choice word). From there it is a struggle for Lee to find common ground with Edward, as she feels so close to him that she can't take it (watching her try to smack herself in the butt with a hairbrush was one of the few comical bits of the movie). But Spader's temperament does not allow for him to give in that easily. He has a meticulously flawless plan for choosing ""the one""; a plan that was clearly used on other commendable women before Lee. And after her, if she chooses to be non-submissive (the scheme she fails to understand). As a consequence, that is the whole point of the movie.
Again, 'Secretary' is not that strange of a movie when it's all said and done. It's just the endless actions and scenes that lead up to the climax that make it so different. It's amazing to see how well James Spader handles the role and how alluring Edward becomes over time. I don't like to question Oscar nominations and whatnot, but can honestly say his performance here is one of the greatest I have ever seen in a movie. Trust me, it's that good. And Maggie's disposition (believe it or not, she's a first-timer), although she's the main character, only compliments Spader and his stellar acting. It's so fun to see love being portrayed in such oddity. And it's even better to see how that altered love can heal a person. This movie is almost flawless, and the only part I didn't find fitting was during the ending (which I won't spoil). Watch 'Secretary' if what I have said intrigued you or made you keep reading till this point. By now you know what kind of person you are, and if you're this type of person (or at least can pretend to be), I highly recommend this. Be submissive.",1055808000,5,5204,4.566844919786096

1840292,5,B00008DDSC,"People have already given plot details in other reviews...they're missing out on a bit though on what makes this movie stand out and be mememorable--and erotic--beyond your regular ""soft porn"" or even hardcore movie.
Lee was institutionalized for a suicide attempt--not for the ""cutting""--she was distracted when cutting and cut too deep--it was an accident.  So...she was treated for the suicide attempt--not for the cutting behavior.
She's a sadist but doesn't realize it.  She WANTS to be a secretary--it's her ultimate job fantasy.  She wants someone to tell her what to do.  Later,when Edward explains to her WHY she cuts herself (it makes her inner pain visible and she can watch it heal--she can't see inner pain and can't make it heal)and tells her YOU WILL NEVER DO IT AGAIN--she gets the control over the behavior that she has fought to control (throwing the ""sewing kit"" away, then retreiving from the trash).  She tried--but was unable to do it on her own.  By giving herself over to ""a higher power"" she finally achieves this and achieves HER ultimate happiness.
I don't think that he ended the relationship because he was disgusted with himself or the situation.  I think that was his taking the relationship to a newer, higher level of intimacy.  He was punishing her/controlling her.  When she  was consciously making mistakes and eagerly getting into spanking position, it took away any punishment that it had.  What to do now?  The ultimate punishment--fire her!  She is devastated--and decides to just go and marry her ""boy-friend""--a young man who also experienced a ""break down"" and had been asking her to marry him. But, while trying on her fiance's mother's wedding dress, she realizes what she needs to do.  She races to the office, barges in and sits down at his desk and refuses to leave. The ultimate fruition of the relationship--she proves her total and unquestioning devotion to him in spite of other people knowing what's going on--even family and friends.  She does this by sitting in his office with her hands flat on his desk without moving from  place, not moving, eating,etc-- even urinating on herself--showing him that she is ready to be his submissive--his ultimate slave.  AND they live happily EVER AFTER.  And that's really the best part in dysfunctional relationships, isn't it?",1055721600,,2321,5.0
1840293,4,B00008DDSC,"When I see a film such as Secretary, I can't escape the impression that the filmmakers use their material (in this case, S&M) for the purpose of simply selling the film--in an ongoing race (in Hollywood) to have the most bizarre, most formerly taboo subject on the table--in order that it will be talked about and, ultimately, that it will sell-rather than for the purpose of shedding light on an unmentioned or under appreciated human condition.
It was difficult for this viewer to relate with any of the main characters.  To a person they were neurotic.  Cutting one's self, for example, is not a healthy thing.  And the subject matter was all about sex and little more (anything new these days?).
The Secretary implicitly presents itself as a psychological drama, yet that aspect of the film doesn't quite work. I never came to an understanding of what drove either of the primary characters in their obsessive-compulsive desires.  Yes, Lee, the main protagonist, has a troubled family, including an alcoholic father.  But that doesn't adequately explain her behaviour.  The other main person, E. Edward, has little known background; he's just, well, very obsessive and not all that consistent as a character.
Nonetheless, the Secretary was visually well put together and the acting, especially by Maggie Gyllenhaal, was superb.  And if you can't get enough of sex in films, this one is rather titillating-although not in the usual way.
If you really enjoy psychological drama with a sexual undercurrent, the 50's film ""Suddenly, Last Summer"" covers the ground very well.

 Secretary is a movie about a woman and man whose lives were not very happy and pleasant and they have lonely souls. They met at work and have a Sadist and Masochist relationship which would be regarded as a very unusual beginning of a romance in a movie.
  It's not easy to tell abnormality apart normality talking about love. I don't even think they have a line between them. People generally say voyeurs and sadomasochists are shameful. However, things can be different just depending on the way you are looking at things and this movie seems to suggest that idea to me.
  The first thing I come up with this movie article is how intricate subject this movie is dealing with. A boss with sadomasochism? And the secretary would love to enjoy the relationship? This movie has turned a sexual harrassment in a work place into a romance. It should be intricate and dangerous. This film has whole serious, comic, erotic, and romantic aspects.
  I am not going to judge this movie rashly because of the S&M relationship.

It's not the S & M side of this movie that makes it refreshing (although it is personally something new to me). It's the way the subject is handled with taste and style.

To help steer herself towards sanity again, she takes a job as a secretary with lawyer E. Edward Gray (James Spader, who although is playing a character similar to the one in 's,l,&v', plays his role wonderfully). At first the work is pretty typical but then he begins reprimanding her for typing errors and the like. It starts out mild but it soon escalates to spankings. And Lee likes it. Her relationship with Gray awakens her and she becomes a new and stronger person. But there's trouble in paradise when Gray begins to feel disgusted with himself. There's more but that will remain undisclosed. I'll start off by saying this film is definately not for everyone.

1840299,4,B00008DDSC,"Don't let the subject matter scare you, folks! This is a beautiful movie.
Maggie Gyllenhaal is absolutely adorable and incredibly sexy as Lee Holloway, a young woman who is a cutter - someone who cuts herself to avoid inner pain, to feel she is alive, to take comfort in the pain itself and the healing. She has recently been released from a mental institution for attempted suicide, and is placed into the care of her amazingly dysfunctional family. She begins cutting herself again, until her new boss, E. Edward Grey (James Spader,) slowly brings her into a dominant/submissive relationship. Spader plays Grey perfectly, portraying some of the most genuine inner conflict I have ever seen on-screen. His intensity is unparalleled.
That's the short story right there, but until you see this film, you won't realie the intensity (there's that word again) of each character's awkwardness with her- or himself, won't release how necessary their relationship is to each of them, and how they come to feel about each other. The story is surprisingly funny and light-hearted both subtly and overtly in places, utterly charming in others, sad in several, and heart-warming overall. The direction is superb, the colors and sets are absolutely gorgeous and rich in color....everything about this film is stunning. It is not shocking, it is not pornographic, but it is sensual and sexual.
Lee's transformation is, of course, the focal point of the film, but there are other layers to appreciate and savor as well. This is an enjoyable ride that allows those unfamiliar with aspects of BDSM to see a tiny glimpse of two peoples' version of it, but it's also more than that. The ""more than that"" is really difficult to describe, I'm sorry. But it's a beautiful, tender love story, and I highly recommend it - I'll definitely watch it again.
The DVD's extra features are somewhat lacking, sadly, but the ""Behind the Secretary"" bit is fun. Despite the stereotypically dark subject matter, as the ""behind"" bit states, she is actually travelling a journey from darkness into light - and that's absolutely it. Mr. Grey's office is a sanctuary where orchids grow, and where Lee begins to grow and blossom, too. The long shots down the hallway to his office underline the journey, and are beautiful unto themselves. It's simply a great, great story! Charming! Beautiful! Lovely! Stunning! Almost perfect!

I didn't think I would like it too much, but still, James Spader lulled in my three bucks.  When it was over, I was amazed.  I loved this movie.  It's an odd love story that just pulls the viewer in.  I found it interesting that in the beginning we see Lee as a frumpy, unpolished girl who evolves into a woman in front of our eyes with the help of Mr. Grey.  The formula ends with the tables turning in a sense with Lee being the dominant one in the relationship (at least I interpreted it that way.)  There were moments I was laughing my butt off (four peas, a small portion of mashed, no, cream potatoes, and all the ice cream one could want) and there were moments I was in shock (bathroom, typo letter, and the lady in the next stall).

When she starts making typing errors, her boss punishes her: firstly with spanking, then by making her crawl on all fours with a letter in her mouth, and building up from there. Curiously, she enjoys the attention that she finds no-where else. Certainly not from her boy friend, who does not give her the excitement that her boss gives her; not from her alcoholic father, nor from her over-protective mother. The attention may be perverse, -and this is a very perverse film- but through it, she discovers her self-esteem and no longer feels the need to inflict wounds on her body. If the psychology passes muster or not, I can't honestly say, but it seems to make narrative sense.
Without, I hope, giving too much away, this film has a happy ending, but this only adds to the film's perversity. An unusual film, but an interesting one. I suppose the moral of this film is that there is someone for everyone, or that love is found when desires are met.

Although the movie deals with somewhat irregular sexual issues, it is never erotic or disgusting. The reason, I suppose, is truthfulness and purity of the characters.
Maggie Gyllenhaal(Lee) did stunning work in playing a very pure, yet unconventional, female secretary. Lee looks somewhat dumb and weak to her desire, but at least she is uncontaminated by the outside world and true to her feelings. The way she tries to seduce James Spader is quite adorable.
James Spader also proved that he is a great actor. Mr. Gray (Spader) is slightly deviated from the normal person, but still he is greatly attractive man. How he heals the wounds of Lee and how he resists her seduction induces laughter from the audiences.
This film is never typical and never normal, yet it shows the true feelings of the human beings. This film depicts physical attraction, yet it show what real love is.

Maggie Gyllenhaal (who I've only glimpsed in Donnie Darko and Adaptation) is stunning.  Lee's journey from darkness to light, through what may be seen by many as a dark avenue, is touching and earnest.  She learns to live and be comfortable in her own skin, as well as finding the strength to fight for what she wants rather than timidly taking the path others set for her.  She plays opposite James Spader (a gifted and beautiful actor) naturally and without a single hitch.  Their relationship grows and transforms both characters with utter grace and sensitivity.
Possibly the most amazing thing about this film is the fact that it never becomes pretentious, preachy or even slightly over the top.  It is always honest, true to its characters and often comic, in spite of its rather taboo subject matter.
Wonderful as the movie is, watching it at home on DVD is not without some difficulty.  If you have a player with a sound equalizer, use it. There are quite a few moments when the sound gets very soft and very loud - often back to back.",1054252800,32,1240,4.609090909090909

Don't be put off by the movie posters. Don't be be turned off by the ad pictures of Spader and Gyllenhaal. Do not step away from the S&M.
This is a very, very dark comedy. It can be so much so that it is not immediately obvious that it is a comedy at all. The romance is very strong, yet unconventional.
For a submissive character, Gyllenhaal's Lee becomes exceptionally strong, far stronger than Spader's E.Edward the dominant. Here is the heart of the movie, Lee's pivotal strength that pulls both of them from their fears and confidence oblivion.
Angelo Badalamenti's soundtrack has been said to pinpoint the Lynchness of the movie. The music is excellent yet not as powerful in its involvement as it was in David Lynch's movies and TV. There is a great importance to the lack of music in a number of scenes, drawing the audience into what is happening most electrically.

But if a fair amount of s/m sex between two consenting adults won't bother you, then ""Secretary"" has a lot to recommend it.

1840328,3,B00008DDSC,"""Secretary"" is an odd little sadomasochistic fantasy in which a lawyer and his secretary establish a kind of master/slave relationship in the office.
Lee Halloway is a deeply disturbed young woman who has just been released from a mental institution where she has been recuperating from a nervous breakdown.  Lee copes with her severely dysfunctional family - her father is an alcoholic who beats his wife, while her mother is a passive victim of abuse who overprotects her daughter - by cutting, gashing and burning herself regularly.  Now, back on the outside, Lee finds employment as secretary to a paralegal, E. Edward Grey, an equally neurotic man who turns out to be a full-blown ""dominator"" behind closed doors.  Together the two forge a bizarre sexual alliance so all-consuming in its nature that one wonders how this small office ever gets any work done at all.
Writer Erin Cressida Wilson and director Steven Shainberg have fun with the many ironies and paradoxes inherent in the offbeat world they are exploring.  For instance, Grey, by restricting Lee's freedom of choice, is actually liberating her by getting her to channel her self-abusive tendencies and desire for pain into a ""healthier,"" more ""productive"" direction.  Lee also discovers that men with unconventional sexual tastes may be no more willing to ""settle down"" and ""commit"" with a likeminded partner than many a man with more traditional sexual proclivities.
In many ways, ""Secretary"" turns out to be almost a recruiting poster for the sadomasochistic lifestyle.  The S&M scenes are kept relatively tame in tone and the film displays a wickedly funny sense of humor for most of its duration.  Moreover, the decidedly upbeat ending of the film could easily have garnished any Doris Day-Rock Hudson romantic comedy - had standards 40 years ago allowed them to explore this type of topic, that is.
As Lee and Grey, Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader turn in terrific performances.  They manage to capture the quirky nature of their respective characters without ever making them appear off-putting or grotesque.  Their performances go a long way towards purging the material of the kind of sleaziness and smarminess one might expect to find here.
The early scenes in the film may be a bit disturbing for some in the audience, mainly because we feel a bit like voyeurs ourselves peering in on the couple, almost as if they were zoo animals or subjects in some sort of psycho-sexual experiment.  But then, as we get to know the characters and come to like them, we become absorbed in their story and find ourselves actually cheering them on and wanting them to find some measure of meaning and happiness in their relationship and lives.
The makers of ""Secretary"" have taken a potentially ""touchy"" subject and injected it with warmth, humanity and insight.  It's hard not to feel uplifted by this film.",1053216000,8,2873,5.014705882352941
1840329,5,B00008DDSC,"I had no idea what to expect when popping this one into the DVD player.

And I'll probably do the same thing tomorrow. This just made my top 10 fav movie of all time list.

Gaitskill's story seems to start off strong and then just abruptly finish with this hunky-dory moment where the love story is so wonderful, and her descriptions of key scenes are so brief that they might as well have never happened.  The film goes much deeper with the characters and plays out the scenes to their greatest effect.  So many people that I've talked to love this film because it is just such an amazing love story, and I don't think you understand that so well with the short story..

1840331,5,B00008DDSC,"The title misled me into expecting a cheesy pseudo-comedy about the tired subject of female exploitation in work places. Then, a bit of reading pointed towards a plot based on maverick overtones of S&M (disclaimer: not really my bag), which had me expecting a psychosexual serving of ""Working Girl"" (that Griffith humdinger from the 80s) with bondage thrown in for good measure.
Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised to be proved mostly wrong on both accounts.
As for the hackeneyed theme of female exploitation, the protagonist's initial willingness to acquiesce to her boss' punitive ministerings could have easily made her a victim of an employer/a man/a senior. Instead, this is quite convincingly shown to be her mode of entry into adulthood, allowing her to develop the inner resources to be a self-determined woman relentless in the pursuit of what and whom she wants.
As for bondage, the depictions are not really bad at all (albeit occasionally guilty of needless nudity, imho) and in fact for better or for worse challenge our pre-conceived notions of sex. Anyone involved in a relationship knows that an essential ingredient is variable power balance -- it's inevitable, despite some people's claims that they have a completely equal affiliation. These power shifts help keep romance vibrant, most likely resulting in wisdom and self-acceptance. What men often confuse as strength -- stoicism, aloofness, obstinacy -- are, more often than not actually weaknesses leading to ignorance, avoidance and ultimate demise. Paradoxically, it's in hapless vulnerability that we actually discover what we're capable of, being able to develop emotional resilience and learning to express desire, sexual or otherwise. Gylenhaal's Lee Holloway embodies this weakness-as-power concept to the T, making an appealing case for growth by any means necessary.
In a nutshell, a delicious, fast-paced, wonderfully filmed, off-beat romantic ""comedy"". Not something I'd necessarily go out on a limb to buy or own, but definitely worth an enjoyable evening's rental. Twice.",1052956800,2,2061,5.44375

And its not just the steamy stuff or the unusual nature of the steamy stuff whick marks this actress in your mind with indelible ink. Gyllenhaal is simply irresistable as the ""secretary"" who is too riddled with anxiety to allow herself to live. Her anxiety gives her a strange awkward  kind of energy which just wins you over in scene after scene. She doesn't realize it but all her life she has been looking for someone to give her permission to live and when James Spader's character does just that she metamorphoses into her true and determined-to-have-her way self. The transformation is a two way street however and as this boss/secretary co-dependence blossoms into full blown love Spader also emerges from his self-imposed exile from his own feeling self. Its not your usual love story but thats just the point--each of us, the film says in its unapologetically and delighfully perverse way,  has to re-invent life to suit our needs. The sets are all painted in the most putrid comic book day-glo colors and yet we grow to accept this abnormality just as we grow to accept the abnormalities of the Gyllenhaal/Spader dynamic. I would argue the best scenes are Gyllenhaal's ""soliloquy's"" in her bedroom and bathroom. In these scenes we penetrate the depths of her very private world, including her fantasy life and it is not a dark world at all. There is  in her utter isolation from the normal channels of existence a rare kind of aloneness, rare because so complete,  but there is also a manic kind of self-celebration in it. This is one story of dysfunction that does not end in a normalizing cure. Quite the opposite, the rest of the world comes to accept Gyllenhaal and Spader on their terms. Certainly the best love story involving spanking I've ever seen. A feel good movie for the secretary (and audience) alike.",1052092800,6,1917,4.782477341389728

Men may view this film differently than women, but as one of the gals, I found some of the most intensely erotic scenes were after their first intimate ""encounter"" in Edwards office which concluded with heavy breathing and the slightest touching of fingers.

One: The ending was perfect.  Other submissives would understand the significance of what she did to prove her love to her Dom that could not accept that some one would love him so much.  She did exactly as he told her to, despite others that pleaded with her to stop.  It was beautiful to watch.
Also, she was only in the mental ward cause she had an accident.  As a masochist and an old cutter, it was nice to watch the parallel of the two in this movie.  The expression on her face when she was spanked for the first time was priceless.
I recomand this movie to any one that is interested in BDSM, or is already in the lifestyle.  It shows the human side of things, not just the kink. ^_^",1050969600,4,767,4.148648648648648
1840359,3,B00008DDSC,"Granted that SECRETARY is indeed ""original"", since it captured the ""Originality award at Sundance 2002, Steven Shainberg presents a most unconventional love story, if it can even be termed 'love'...Well, I suppose so.
Maggie Gyllenhaal, the female counterpart of the dynamic bro/sister acting powerhouse that is Jake and Maggie, stars in her first truly breakthrough role as the emotionally withered waif Lee who works her way from the bottom up at a seedy law office run by vulture-like Edward (James Spader). Things look innocent at first, then the sensuous romp really begins, when Ed forces Lee to deliver papers on all fours, play ""horsey"", and don various S&M devices. Sexual pleasure, or merely a kindered spirit? Just another working girl? Maybe. Eventually, Lee is torn between obssession and mediocrity in her would-be fiance, played by Jeremy Davies.
While ""Secretary"" is no lightweight, it may present some viewers with issues of moral contridiction. What is true love? Is it always the most pure and innocent of heart, or the one who will best foster our needs, be they inane fetishes or no? Perhaps Shainberg is too hellbent on creating psychological depth in character, or in the case of Ed, not enough of it.  I would love to give into the conclusion that Ed and Lee live happily ever after. But while Shainberg molds his characters convincingly, he forgets a helping of heart and compassion, which seems stiffled and repressed.
What's wrong with innocence and love? Nothing apparently, but I guess bizarre fetish and sado-masochism goes a lot farther. Atleast that will keep your peepers on the screen for the hour and a half that is ""Secretary"". Kitchy, nostalgic colors and tones in the production values, and Gyllenhaal's powerhouse pormance compensate for a lack of charm just barely.",1050796800,4,1805,5.097972972972973

As the film begins, Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal) has just been released from institutional therapy. Lee has a level of self-esteem that's abysmal to the point of involving self-mutilation with sharp objects. (She even has her own first aid kit to disinfect and treat the wounds as soon as she makes them!) And whatever therapy she got didn't stick. But, life goes on, so she takes a typing class, and subsequently lands a job as a SECRETARY for the perfectionist lawyer ""Mr. Grey"" (James Spader).
Mutual assessment soon reveals potential for an S&M relationship where Grey is the ""S"" and Lee the ""M"". Courting, so to speak, and foreplay involve the boss making increasingly difficult demands of Lee's job performance with the mutual understanding that the latter will fail and punishment will follow. And what's a poor girl to do when making deliberate spelling errors in legal correspondence just doesn't push Grey's lust button anymore?
Spader's Grey persona is so deliciously creepy - not sinister, just creepy - that his paralegal does her work in such an unusual hiding place that she's rarely seen, even by the audience. And the delightful Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Holloway is so otherwise girl-next-door, except for her preoccupation with cutting edges, that I'm now surreptitiously scrutinizing our office secretaries for barely-hidden scars. And Jeremy Davies is terrific as Lee's nominal boyfriend, the painfully pathetic Peter.
While SECRETARY was in the theaters, it probably wasn't a film that you would've taken your prim and proper grandmother to see for her day trip away from the assisted care facility. It has some artistically done full-frontal nudity and a couple scenes of X-rated heavy breathing. SECRETARY is a stylish and darkly humorous treatment of a delicate subject that allows the viewer to snicker without the guilty feeling of having been discovered with a dirty magazine. (Of course, if Granny finds it knee-slapping funny, you might want to rethink your assumptions about her younger years.)

Unsure what to do with her life, she applies for a job as a secretary at a law firm.  But this is no ordinary office and Lee is no ordinary girl.  Edward and Lee begin a strange and turbulent work relationship that later develops into a Dominant/Submissive relationship.  As the film progresses, it becomes more bizarre. ...
What makes this film so great is Maggie.  She is able to lend an innocent quality to Lee that makes her oddly enduring.  Yes, she is submissive and a freak by normal standards, but she is also a demure quiet girl.  James Spader is good as well in his role as the sadistic boss that oddly falls in love with her throughout the film.

It's a twisted tale of two people with some serious hangups, who somehow manage to find a connection in the midst of some kinky activities at work.  Maggie Gyllenhaal plays the titular self-mutilator, Lee, who upon her release from an institution takes a job as a secretary for the stern E. Edward Grey (James Spader).  She clearly has a submissive personality, which Edward seizes upon to exercise his own dominant tendencies.  At first he just yells at her when she messes up, but pretty soon she's wearing a saddle and being spanked for making typos.  It's pretty therapeutic for both of them, and the S & M activities clearly give Lee and Edward some sort of symbiotic relationship where both can work out their control issues.  One could even say it constitutes love, which is an idea that the second half of the movie addresses.  It's interesting to watch the way the dynamics of Lee and Edward's relationship develop, but what really makes the movie is the brilliant acting and director Steven Shainberg's keen eye for detail.  The whole movie is full of little subleties that had me laughing at the inspired absurdity of it all, and Spader and Gyllenhaal can convey more with a single expression than some actors can in an entire monologue.  If you're not amused at the scene where Edward gets turned on watching Lee root through a dumpster, then you'd better check your pulse.  The film's bizarre sense of humor is often reminiscent of my all-time favorite TV show, ""The Simpsons,"" but a lot dirtier.  If, like me, you're appalled at the near-constant mundaneness of mainstream cinema, you owe it to yourself to check ""Secretary"" out.",1049500800,20,1807,4.930693069306931
1840383,3,B00008DDSC,Starts out slow then get funny then goes slow again. The acting is great by both Gylenhaal and Spader. Maggie's facial expressions are great. Would it prefered it to be more funny.,1049414400,,180,4.65625
1840384,4,B00008DDSC,"Maggie Gyllenhaal is a wonderfully offbeat young actress with a string of minor roles in some terrific independent films. In ""Secretary"", she makes her starring role debut, and she's terrific. Gyllenhaal plays Lee Holloway, an unstable girl who has just been released from a mental institution. She gets a job as a secretary for Edward Grey, an overbearing lawyer (James Spader). Edward is far from a normal boss however. His punishment for typos and minor spelling errors begin with mild humiliation, but as Lee swiftly responds to his demands,the punishments slowly begin to escalate.
""Secretary"" treats kinky sex with extreme tenderness. To his credit, director and co-writer Steven Shainberg depicts the strange sexual interplay between Lee and Edward, with restraint. He is more interested in their emotions than their actions, and weights the images accordingly. When Lee goes to work for Edward, he sees her only as another in a string of women who will indulge his fantasies of dominance. But Lee transforms their connection from a game to a relationship, and paradoxically frees them both from guilt and self-hatred.
Mr. Spader does a smart, considered job as Edward, a man who does not understand his own needs until Lee begins to bloom with his attention. Just as he helps her unlock her sensuality, she helps him unlock his kindness.
Based on a highly regarded short story by Mary Gaitskill, the movie shows wit as well as insight. Lee attempts a romantic relationship with a fellow psychiatric case (Jeremy Davies), including a bedroom interlude. When he sweetly asks, ""Did I hurt you?"" there is no disguising the disappointment in her voice when she answers ""No.""
Whether it shocks or disturbs or amuses, ""Secretary"" deserves applause for doing something most movies avoid these days: addressing adult sexuality - a non-mainstream kind of sexuality -with wit, style and compassion. This film is highly recommended!!!",1049328000,11,1930,5.189102564102564
1840385,5,B00008DDSC,"Young Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal) gets her first job as a secretary in the law office of Mr. E. Edward Grey (James Spader). Shy, frumpy and unsure of herself, Lee initially has trouble coping with Mr. Grey's perfectionism. The boss and  secretary's dependency on one another grows and evolves into an overt dominant-submissive relationship. Through this relationship, Lee gains self-confidence and is able to put the self-destructive habits of her past behind her. Both Lee and Mr. Grey find the love and understanding that they crave in this unconventional but mutually fulfilling relationship.

Secretary is equal parts love story, psychological drama, and sex farce. In some ways, it is a classic romance: Two needy people discover that what they need is each other. But in Secretary, the characters' emotional needs are extreme, and their ways of expressing love are eccentric. The film treats the subject of dominant-submissive relationships with humor and generally good nature. It doesn't equate these relationships with dysfunction, but instead asserts that dominant-submissive behavior can be a way for some people to  overcome dysfunction, or at least to transform it into something harmless. The performances are terrific. James Spader is wonderful as Mr. Grey, a middle-aged divorced lawyer who is distrustful of love and sometimes afraid of what his own desires might mean. Maggie Gyllenhaal is radiant, funny, and totally convincing as the bright but troubled young secretary.

Secretary isn't graphic, but it is kinky, and it does not moralize. If you don't like the idea of ""alternative"" lifestyles, you won't like this film. If you don't mind breaking with convention, I highly recommend Secretary. It is funny, touching, provocative, and boasts some great performances.",1049328000,17,1792,5.4352517985611515
1840386,5,B00008DDSC,"I have heard that this film has been critized by feminists as being anti-woman.  I totally disagree.  This film shows a woman dealing with her sexual baggage in the only way she knows how.
The actress,Maggie Gyllenhaal, does a great job playing her character.  The infamous spanking scene is a good example.  She could have played it completely over the top.  Instead she uses
subtle facial expressions to covey the confusion and excitement she is feeling.
James Spader does a great job also ,as usual, in a complex roleas her repressed boss.
This movie is for adults, not children or people who are bothered
by sexual expression on film.  The director has done a great job
dealing with very mature themes and walking a fine line to keep the film funny.",1049328000,7,753,4.709923664122138
1840397,5,B00008DDSC,"I will willingly watch any movie of any kind, and go along with the story so long as it keeps me under its spell.  Which is exactly what this movie did for me.  It's my new favorite movie.
""Secretary"" is funny (in it's own strange way) and absolutely mesmerizing.  If you can get past the fact that every character in this movie is bizarre and just go with it, you will love it. It's been awhile since a movie has made me this happy.  I've been watching far too many depressing and unoriginal movies that left me feeling like the future of my attending a movie screening bleak.
Lee has just been released from an institution, and it's the day of her sister's wedding.  Early on, she is very odd and you wonder what the heck is going on.  She's cutting herself, and her father is an alcoholic.  Life is not very happy for our dear odd bird, Lee.  Then she applies for her first job as secretary to E. Edward Grey.  Her existence takes quite a turn once working for Mr. Grey.
Mr. Grey is into S&M, and when Lee starts making typos, he gives the bad girl something to remember him by. She loves every minute.  This is what floats their boat, so to speak...If it makes them happy then so be it.
Per his request, she stops cutting.  He also tells her what to do all the time, even what to eat for dinner, and she gladly obliges. She does everything he tells her. Underneath her submissiveness, Lee is embarking on a very weird journey into finding herself and falls in love.
It has some great dialogue, too. Now when I answer the phones at work, I smile and laugh to myself, and all I can think of is this movie.
It's brilliantly acted by all the actors especially Maggie.  Her performance was the best of all actresses in the year 2002 that I had to the distinct pleasure to witness.  She took on the role and truly made it a spectacle to see.  It was like watching a caterpillar turn into a butterfly.  I thought that she and James Spader had an amazing chemistry together.
I say to each is own, some of us appreciate films that push the buttons of others.  This film is worth watching.
Also, I am a Secretary myself, and couldn't help but laugh at a lot of the scenes between Lee and Mr. Grey.  I've worked for some real strange men, but no one was quite like E. Edward. This movie should be shown on Sundance on April 23rd, to pay homage to all secretaries like me.",1049328000,,2364,4.26457399103139
1840398,4,B00008DDSC,"This movie is so wonderful. While not for everyone, I wish I could say it was for everyone, but it certaintly isn't. A lot of people will be turned off, or uncomfterable by the subjects presented in this movie. But if you have an open mind, then you just have to see this movie!!Even though it goes into sadomasochism(did i get that right),and the acts of dominants/submissives, you certaintly do not have to be involved with any of these acts in order to love this movie. I mean, I'm 13, so I obviously don't  have any experiences with these themes. Like I mentiones previously all you need is an open mind. I expected this movie to take sadomasochism and make a big gag out of it, but it didn't. It dealt with the topic so sensitively, that for the first time in my life, I started to view these people not as sick people, but just as slightly irregular regular people with different needs. But I believe that sadomasochism is just a sub-theme, and that the real theme of this movie is,living,being happy,or in this case becoming happy. We start out with two broken characters, and together,they can live healthy, if slightly different lives. Maggie is just magical,and such a special and unique presence. I believe she makes the film what it is. We view her transformation from a bruised,closed-up little girl, into a confident,acceptive of her own-differences young woman. She has such a future ahead of her. James Spader tends to act a bit too silly to overcome his good looks, but overall, he turned in a great performance. I just wish that the movie would have had a bit more of a bckround on James Spader's character, and that the ending was a little too spontaneous for me. This movie was funny,sad,quirky,and totally heartwarming. It looks at love from a different level, not just the one that we've been fed with over the years. In the end, they're just two people, who,together, accept themselves for what they are, and come to realize that they ain't that bad. You gotta see it!!!",1048464000,4,1993,4.645892351274788

even healthy. The process of learning how to accept

some (certainly not all) the path taken by the main

I have seen way too many movies that deal with the emotional aspects  of submission as being ones that are entirely negative.  This film hit the nail on the head when it showed that submissive women find strength in their surrender.
It also let the viewer see that Dominant men aren't monsters but just irregular regular guys trying to co-exist with their hidden desires to control their partners in ways that are beneficial to both.  I'm no pro at writing so I hope I'm saying this well.....but simply, if you want to gain some understanding of people who choose this alternative lifestyle and how it changes them for the better, see this movie!!!",1042070400,124,785,4.625899280575539
1840403,5,B00008DDSC,"Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader absolutely deserve nominations for best acting. From the very first scene, neither ever drops the internal torment, fighting with their respective 'forbidden' compulsions to have a chance at happiness and fulfilment with another. Not a film for everyone, but if you can accept that desires different than yours can be very real for another, Secretary is a must see.",1038355200,5,400,5.265625
1840404,4,B00008DDSC,"This film deals with the eroticism of classic dominance and submission.  And yet it's a quirky character-driven romantic comedy.  Maggie Gyllenhaal stars as Lee, a young woman who has just been released from a mental hospital.  Seems she's into self-mutilation and even though her mother hides all the knives in the house, Lee still manages do some surreptitious cuts on her inner thighs with her manicure implements.  Soon, she gets a secretarial job for a lawyer, played by James Spader. It's a rather strange office where they still use old-fashioned manual typewriters. Weird details like this keep the story unreal.
In spite of a rather placid romance with another former mental hospital graduate, Jeremy Davis, there's no doubt that Lee is attracted to her boss, who shows signs of having his own compulsive mental problems.  Eventually, she makes some typographical errors.  Her boss then has her bend over the desk while he administers a spanking.  She's immediately turned on and starts to pursue him.
The script does well in that it makes the secretary both vulnerable and plucky at the same time.  There's a lot of character development. She's a fine actress and seems to own the role.  James Spader and Jeremy Davis are excellent as well.  The script does not do well when it lapses into dreamy fantasy sequences which slow down the action.  It's also longer than it needs to be and makes the same points too many times.  And the ending is ridiculous and doesn't grow intrinsically from the plot.
The best thing about ""Secretary""  is that it's different and treads where others have feared to go.  The tone is lighthearted throughout and there are some real connections between the characters during the erotic scenes.  However, it sure isn't for everybody.  And some people will find it quite uncomfortable to watch.  I enjoyed it but it just had too many faults for me to give it more than a lukewarm recommendation.",1037404800,18,1930,4.907407407407407
1840405,5,B00008DDSC,"""Secretary"" is daring and innovative, even though its subject matter could be tagged passe given that DS and SM now are virtually mainstream.
Rich with symbolism, the film plays out slowly and deliberately. The tone and pacing seem to invite viewers to play along. I found myself repeatedly urging the submissive Lee and her dominant boss Edward to, ""Hurry up already.""
The two main characters are well drawn and developed. Even the characters' quirks and eccentricities are absurd to the point of being realistic.
That said, the film does have weaknesses. Lee's parents provide some insight into the protaganist's character but are occasionally distracting. The film, at times, also seems overstylized and overproduced.
Nevertheless, this is a film that forced me into the mind of a vulnerable, at-times ditzy submissive woman - and made me care about her progression.
The movie is billed as a racy DS story, but really, it's about two people  who find in each other, not only love, but a kind of salvation. Lee replaces her cutting with DS. Edward channels his own interests in the relationship.
Ultimately, the two find completeness in each other. Their journey to that is inviting and captivating.",1036454400,11,1201,5.096446700507614

But now that I am in that lifestyle this movie should not represent the BDSM  community because he assaulted her without her consent, and whether consensual or consensual -non-consensual there should be discussions before and after the 'agent's as specifically the horse play and so on.

7981808,2,B00008DDSC,"RELEASED IN 2002 and directed by Steven Shainberg, ""Secretary"" is a romantic dramedy about a young woman (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who spent some time at a mental hospital for self-harm (e.g. cutting). She apprehends a job as a secretary to a quirky, arduous lawyer (James Spader) wherein their employer-employee bond turns increasingly sexual in a dominant/submissive way.

This is the first mainline film in America to breach the difficult topic of BDSM, walking the balance beam between being either too amusing or too offensive. For those not in the know, BDSM is an overlap of acronyms: BD stands for Bondage and Discipline; DS for Dominance and Submission; and SM for Sadism and Masochism. I didn't really know the movie tackled BDSM before viewing it; I thought it was simply a romance-in-the-office type flick with maybe some kinky elements.

The movie is polarizing, unsurprisingly. I read a few reviews by respectable critics and one was fascinated by it, giving it an incredible 10/10 Stars (Why Sure!), while another wrote it off as a film for sick people, granting it 1/10 Stars. Whilst I find the romance-at-the-office element interesting, I could care less about the BDSM angle. Regardless, the first half is amusing enough and Maggie is a winsome treat, but the second half gets a little too deviant and borders on porn.

Yet the movie ends well with a well-intentioned message: This is a story about two people who have an affinity for DS that find each other and their relationship may or may not work (no spoilers). I suppose the movie is trying to get across that pain can be therapeutic as long as it's applied by the right hand with the right intention. Thus two people with an affinity for BDSM can develop a relationship that works, for them. But not me; no thanks.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 47 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles. WRITERS: Mary Gaitskill (short story) and Erin Cressida Wilson & Shainberg (screenplay).
