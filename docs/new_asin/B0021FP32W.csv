3832220,5,B0021FP32W,My son loves Bob the Builder and he really loved that this one came with a little car. Good video. We also purchased a Bob the Builder Christmas special with Elton John and my son loves it!,1293321600,,189,4.135135135135135

3832222,5,B0021FP32W,"Well, Bob has really upped the ante! With his newest DVD comes ... a neat toy truck tucked right in on top. This is pretty darn good thinking - offer the onscreen fun of his crew paired with a physical collectible to enjoy later.

This disc includes five episodes that have never been aired on television before. If you're like me, the discs with this content are truly the most valuable. There's nothing more disappointing than popping in a new DVD, only to be met with""Oh, I've already seen this one."" Not here. This is fresh content, guaranteed to buy you 57 minutes of quiet time.

The adventures here have Bob and his Can-Do Crew dipping their hands (and wheels) into all sorts of new activities. They work on constructing an entire ice cream parlor (complete with traditional giant ice cream cone on top) and an exercise park at Bobland Bay. Scoop, Muck, Gripper, Grabber, Bristle Flex and Tumbler find that working together, they can get nearly any job done!

Episodes: Scoop's Best Team Ever, Go Mr. Bentley Go, Packer's Trailer Trouble, Muck's Machine Wash, Breezy Bristle",1246320000,9,1081,4.770053475935829

8349034,5,B0021FP32W,"This Bob the Builder  DVD kept the Grand-kids busy. They watched it over and over.  For a long time, they spoke endlessly about Bob and I believe they learned a lot about team work and family values from BTB as well.  It's a wonderful series for kids to watch and gain wholesome life values.

If there's any complaint, it would be;  How could Bob the Builder be so blind that he couldn't see that Wendy was crazy about him?  Bob should have married Wendy but maybe that's for another episode.  I mean, Wendy was nutso about Bob.  Come on Bob,  Wake Up!

Oh, did I mention that I spent a lot of time watching BTB with the Grand-kids ???",1415404800,,635,4.260504201680672
