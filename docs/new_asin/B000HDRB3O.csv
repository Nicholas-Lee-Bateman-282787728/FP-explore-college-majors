8138847,2,B000HDRB3O,"Sadly the Courbet paintings used as illustrations are very far from museum quality. I have seen most of his major works in Europe (Muse d'Orsay), several times over the years, in US museums, and the 2008 exhibition at the Met. I can tell the difference! Too often the colors hint at paintings photographed decades ago, before the works had been cleaned. They also seem to have been lifted off printed materials. In some close ups, the graininess, characteristic of a printed photograph, becomes painfully visible. It is not brush strokes that are revealed, but a pattern of thousands of very short lines identical in length: it is the photograph of a printed page! The close up is of a reproduction!

The production did not film the works in museums. Not a single work is presented in its actual museum context! They look like book images instead, and old books at that! Vistas of Swiss landscapes use neither panning nor motion, they are always fixed views, and the same one is used repeatedly. It could have been on a page from a National Geographic issue or from a glossy calendar.

That poor quality of the production strikes one as cheap, dishonest, and is extremely disappointing. One feels cheated. I dare not imagine the reactions of the art professors and critiques, who had contributed their knowlege to that production, when they watched it for the first time!

All the interviews look fresh and recent, which may account for the ""All-new location footage""bragged about on the paper sleeve. That qualifier cannot apply to any of the paintings shown. The running commentary and the interviews are actually informative and interesting, thus two stars instead of only one. But a program about a painter is usually to enjoy viewing his works. If you wish to enjoy viewing Courbet's works and their colors, you will be sorely disappointed, and even disgusted. Stay away from that DVD if you are looking for authenticity.",1443484800,,1926,4.901840490797546

8138849,4,B000HDRB3O,"It's easy for me to think about realism as a movement of the 1700s and impressionism as one of the 1900s.  However, here is a realist painter who lived entirely in the 19th century.  In the same way that Da Vinci and Michelangelo did not get along, this work says Monet thought Courbet was ""pass'e.""

The work uses blurry images for their reenactments.  They use an actor with a unibrow to portray Courbet, yet photos of the painter suggest he had two separate brows.  This work may be highly influenced by ""Behind the Music.""  When the narrator speaks of Courbet's death, they show a lit candle falling upon a painter's palette.

Like many other painters, Courbet was a lady's man who never married.  The work stated that he liked to fake his class background.  Many people think Madonna grew up in a poor area of Detroit, but actually her father was an engineer.  The Hughes Brothers were raised in the suburbs, not the ghetto that they represented in ""Menace II Society.""  Surprisingly, Courbet lived when Marxist writers were publishing, so it's odd that those writers are never mentioned.

Like many artists of the 19th century, the work states that Courbet loved Japanese prints.  Later, it shows a painting of his mistress.  The work never connects the two.  The female figure is presented as having epicanthic eyelids and yet none of the scholars note it.

The work emphasizes that Courbet was critiqued for his lack of showing dimensionality.  What stood out to me was how so many paintings seemed blurry and cracked.  I wonder if the French government can pay to have his work cleaned the way the Sistine Chapel has been cleaned.

There are artists who are political, but only in words.  This work says Courbet was imprisoned for his support of political movements.  This was an artist who paid for his views in many ways, including exile.",1195603200,,1849,4.751572327044025
