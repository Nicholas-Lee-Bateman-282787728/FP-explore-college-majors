If you like Pittsburgh history",1471392000,,66,5.0
7996514,5,B0000A9GIB,"One thing I may need to know is this:  In the introduction, when they talked about the Bridge to Nowhere incident on 12 December 1964 (it's been 41 years since it happened), did they reenact the incident?

This is my favorite program in the Pittsburgh History Series.  Premiering on October 28, 1990, it won two Mid-Atlantic Region Emmy Awards (Rick Sebak won for Producer of the Outstanding Cultural Program).

They not only talk about what was The Bridge to Nowhere, they also talk about bridges that cross the Monongahela, the Allegheny, and the Ohio rivers.  It is definitely a favorite among those who watch Rick's programs.",1134259200,,629,4.89622641509434
