8478792,5,B005LZQKBC,"Flim maker Elmer Hawkes' CUBA FOR KIDS scores another bullseye. The film features the sights and sounds of a country long thought to be an enemy of the USA and in the process demystifies and humanizes our neighbor to the south.  A gorgeous and fascinating film, sure to educate both students and adults alike.",1318032000,,309,4.722222222222222
