891368,5,6304498349,"Descendants of Wing Chun is kung fu at it's greatest glory. This movie depicts the wing chun fighting style to a T and it is extremely entertaining. The story line is pretty good for a kung fu flick and the fight scenes are many and fantastic. The first 20 minutes or so is a little dull, but hang in there, cuz it will pick up, I promise. This is a ""must have"" for any kung fu fan or fan of the wing chun fighting style.",987811200,,421,3.9647058823529413
891369,5,6304498349,"As opposed to Michelle Yeoh's ""Wing Chun"", ""The Descendant of Wing Chun"" is a far more genuine (not to mention, wireless) display of the Wing Chun fighting style in all of its old-school glory (1978 release). It starts out with two fighters engaging in a ""friendly"" contest of martial skill and doesn't let up until the end credits. Great fights, authentic Wing Chun training techniques, and an interesting storyline make this a keeper. Note: for those of you that like Chinese dialogue and subtitles, this DVD has none, but the dub is very well done. The voice actor for Fatty Kwei is hilarious, english accent and all. Don't delay on this one, folks, it can't last at this almost absurd price. A definite gem.",984614400,,711,4.741935483870968
891370,3,6304498349,"A good movie but not a good showing of the Wing Chun style of Kung Fu. Also,the guy on the box is rarely in the movie. The plot is about a Wing Chun master who helped put away a criminal, but sometime later the criminal gets out and along with a fellow kung fu friend comes looking for revenge. Now,the master and his students have to fight for their lives.",973900800,,357,4.114285714285714

7873114,5,6304498349,"Fierceful fighting displays the Wing Chun style of kung fu in this tale of revenge. Evil Bandit Ma Lung escapes from prison and seeks revenge on retired Wing Chun teacher Lan Chan, who had helped to imprison him. Ma wreaks havoc on Lam's Wing Chun schools and kills a few of Lam's students. Lam has no choice but to avenge his students' death at a final showdown confronting Ma. Director Wang Ha creates an unforgettable tale of vengeance that won't release you from its grips until the final credits.",1257033600,,501,4.640449438202247
7873115,1,6304498349,"I've never seen a kung fu movie that wasted the echo sound effect as much as it was wasted in this one! This movie sucked, the storyline sucked, the title had nothing to do with the movie itself, the action was mediocre at best even the ending sucked! Leave this s#!t alone! Buy it only if you feel like wasting money or you're getting revenge on someone! A better movie to buy with the actual wing chun martial arts style in it is: Ip Man starring Donnie Yen!",1247356800,,460,4.238636363636363
7873116,1,6304498349,"This is the absolute worst (martial arts or otherwise) film I've ever had the displeasure of watching.  Any viewers should be reimbursed for their time wasted.  I would recommend this film to no one.  This ""c"" movie had no story line, terrible acting bad correography, and nothing of value to offer viewers. As a Wing Chun practitioner and avid martial arts movie goer, I would like to offer some quality films with skillful actors and great fight scenes.  A few are: ""Fist of Legend"", ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"", ""The Legend of the Drunken Master"", ""The Seven Samurai"", and anything by Bruce (strictly for the quality of Bruce's technique and forgiving the cheesiness of the films).  Have fun!",1049241600,10,699,4.94017094017094
7873117,3,6304498349,"this movies is just half decent........
can anybody tell me what this movie is really about ?????????
(cheesy FF and choppy fight scenes)",1010448000,,137,5.0
7873118,2,6304498349,"This movie is a strange one.. first of all, the dubbing... This is classic 70s kung fu action, that is relatively slow, step by step choreography and voices straight out of .... The annoying whining of some of these characters will really get to you after a while. More so, the reason i bought this movie is because it claims to be showing off wing chun. Now compared to the excellent Prodigal Son, Descendant of wing chun has nothing to show for. The wing chun on display is sloppy and poorly coordinated, a lot of the positions are plain wrong and the overall style is blurred by lots of ""fancying-up"" and unnecessary movements. While in The Prodigal Son the wing chun principles are told of with pride and accuracy, showing off the style as what it is, a brutal, to the point demonstration of force that can throw off any martial artist, Descendant... demonstrates only the ""fancy"" stuff and puts emphasis on visually unimpressive (and in this case poorly executed) techniques such as the one inch punch.
Overall, an average 70s style kung fu flick with poor wing chun. Not worth the money. Get prodigal son or instruction vids instead.",994291200,5,1139,4.7
