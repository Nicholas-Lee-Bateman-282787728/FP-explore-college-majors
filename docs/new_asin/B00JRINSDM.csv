8653595,5,B00JRINSDM,"This video provides many wonderful insights into what it was like to serve in the early days (Sixties) of the Peace Corps in Afghanistan, particularly from the perspective of the female volunteers . We had female PCVs in Peru, but they were not as constrained by religion and culture as those in Afghanistan. I served in Peru from 1965-67 and many of my experiences were similar to those described in this video, although not entirely. The culture and language of Afghanistan were far more alien to Western culture than were those of Peru. Once the second most important Spanish Viceroyalty in the Americas, established by Spain in Lima in 1542, Peru had a long Western colonial tradition. Spanish is a romance language relatively easy to learn compared to Farsi and Christianity (or some variant thereof) was the dominant religion in Peru. Farsi is far more difficult than Spanish and I doubt very many early volunters had much contact with Islam before going to Afghanistan. They had a steep learning curve. An excellent companion piece to this video is the book,  ""The Early Years of the Peace Corps in Afghanistan: A Promising Time."" Together, the video and book will give you quite a complete view of the Peace Corps in Afghanistan in the decade of the Sixties and how the experience changed the lives of those who served forever and for better.",1485475200,,1350,4.8441558441558445
