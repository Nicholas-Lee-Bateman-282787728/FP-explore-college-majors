8210506,4,B000TSIK0A,"This is a one hour DVD of some (6, in fact) of Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson's early fights in the King of the Cage organization. The fights included are against the following opponents:

- Marvin Eastman
- Rob Smith
- Charlie West
- Dave Taylor
- Rocko Henderson
- Sean Grey

The fights are good and show Rampage's slams, strikes, and even a submission, as well as his resiliency in tough matches. Though the quality isn't as high as in Pride or UFC DVDs, especially the production values, at this price this DVD is a great deal for Rampage fans.

There aren't any extra features included; the DVD has a short introduction and conclusion by an announcer from KOTC and that's it. The time between rounds has even been cut.

So in the end, although the excitement of these fights doesn't equal Rampage's match-ending slam on Ricardo Arona or his KO of Chuck Liddell, this DVD is still worth checking out with some solid bouts.",1191283200,4,921,4.597560975609756
