8133830,2,B000GPPPQ8,"This work starts with a description of the Vikings pillaging a British town.  However, the work eventually looks at other phenomenon such as Viking women, jewelry, and religion.  It's easy to assume that once Ancient Rome went Christian, then so did all of Europe.  However, here were a group of people that still practiced ""pagan"" religions during the Middle Ages.  The work also shows that Viking travels were far-reaching.  This mentions that they came to North America, but they reached Constantinople as well.

The narrator is an American woman who good sound recording backing her up.  The videotaped interviewees were all British men with bad recording.  Their accents aren't thick, but because of the bad equipment, some viewers may not be able to hear them.

Though many sources say the Vikings did not have horns or other ornamentation on their helmets, this work showed horns, wings, and all kinds of stuff without ever saying it's historically inaccurate.",1171670400,11,967,5.10828025477707
