8288479,4,B001CO32H6,"I teach art history at the college level and I love this series. In fact, several of my students have become engrossed in them as well and purchased them also...really interesting and it makes the painting come alive. Love it!",1392681600,,226,4.675
8288480,5,B001CO32H6,"The Best Experience in TV Shows About Art
The series is superb! I haven't seen anything like it. It teaches you so much about how to look on these works of art, that it seems that you see them for the first time. I hope I can get all the seasons of the series!!!",1365292800,,262,3.8703703703703702
8288481,5,B001CO32H6,"Some people have difficulty reading.  The title says ""The Private Life of a MASTERPIECE"" subtitle, ""Christmas MASTERPIECES""  Its all about ART whose subject happens to be ""Christmas in Art""  While this single title doesn't come up to the standards of the original boxed set, it is a valuable addition to anyone's ART library.  All I can say is, ""Keep up the good work, and bring on MORE & MORE & MORE!!!!",1240444800,,404,4.647887323943662
8288482,5,B001CO32H6,"I can't make head nor tail of the one star review below, and since it's the only review so far it might make a casual browser think that the product is terrible and not worth clicking on. It's not, it's up to the same five-star standards as the previous Private Life of a Masterpiece programmes - and I hope my five star review here will help to even things out a bit. Beyond that, I don't really know what to add - far more erudite people than myself have written thorough reviews for the Private Life box set and I would suggest that anyone unsure about making a purchase should have a look at those (if they don't convince you, nothing will!).

Programmes on this DVD:
Pieter Bruegel - The Census At Bethlehem
Jan van Eyck - The Annunciation
Paul Gauguin - God's Child",1230940800,,771,4.354166666666667
