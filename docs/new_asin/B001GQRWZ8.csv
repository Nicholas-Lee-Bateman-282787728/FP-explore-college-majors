8306777,5,B001GQRWZ8,"Unlike other Belly Dance videos I have seen that claim to be a work out but are really to slow paced for me, Janelle keeps you moving and working up a sweat. Just have a good time, without stress about how you look. Your dance skills just naturally improve over time while you enjoy a happy workout to start or end your day.",1367712000,,324,4.158730158730159

8306779,5,B001GQRWZ8,"First off, I need to thank Janelle for being the sweetest seller i ever dealt with, real cooperative, nice and wonderful lady :)

Her DVD is exactly what I've been looking for: bellydance cardio that fits all levels, not too easy, or boring, and not too advanced moves; Simply, something to get me dancing right away without stopping and that DVD doesn't disappoint.

The cardio is great for anyone who wants practice companion and to lose weight for sure. I came across that dvd because I wanted to lose some weight especially from my lower body. I rarely make it to the gym and love bellydance cardio and thankfully Janelle is a waaaaay better than Rania workouts!

The DVD consists of 3 sections: warm up; instructions and cardio followed by a cool down.

I usually skip the warm up but Janelle included a complete one!

The instructions section is very excellent for beginners. Janelle demonstrated each move clearly, with a pure technique and many repetitions. She also added arms to all bellydance moves ( something many dancers ignore and it makes dancing a bit sloppy).

The cardio section is what I always jump into and it's great for shaping up and losing weight. In fact, I decided to practice that cardio 3 days in a row and yes!!! I start losing weight and feel great. Besides, Janet included a huge amount of moves with layers added! it's like an encyclopedia of practical bellydance moves that we see in today's egyptian cabaret! some of the moves I haven't seen anywhere else! When you click on the cardio itself you will find many sections on it:
Traveling steps,
Folkloric steps,
Hips,
Traveling with hips,
Travel combinations.
So, you can always start your cardio with your favorite section.

I was hesitated about buying it caz i thought it's for beginners only but it's great for all levels, especially for those (like me) who passed 25 yrs and started getting out of shape.",1311292800,,1895,4.741641337386018
8306780,5,B001GQRWZ8,"I just got finished doing this video for the first time and I just HAD to write this review. I LOVE this video. When making this purchase, I was looking for something that would have both instructional and choreographed components that were simple enough to catch onto and challenging enough to work up to. This video provides just that.

Jannelle has such a mild manner that she pulls you into the ""class,"" so no matter how awkward you feel (or how ridiculous you look), you can still feel at ease in finding your way. The instruction is efficient and the cardio section is a great workout. Finally, the women in the video are REAL women with REAL bodies that make you feel as if a better belly is attainable.

I would definitely purchase another video by her if she produced one.

This video is not for anyone beyond an intermediate level. But for those looking for a great start, this is it!",1266451200,,894,4.506172839506172

With Jannelle Cortes & her Belly Dance Workout for Every Body DVD, I have inspiration at my fingertips, a complete cardio workout AND I can learn how to do the moves correctly while having fun. Jannelle is someone you can relate to, who brings her talent, expertise & upbeat disposition to this great workout. I don't feel stressed out or ""worried about doing it right."" By watching the instructional... I see, hear & can do the moves safely. Other videos don't break down the moves or do them so slowly that I get bored. Jannelle strikes the perfect balance for me: technique, great energy & a vigorous work out I keep coming back to again & again! I've lost about 20lbs belly dancing and am strong & toned. The weight loss benefits & the confidence gained have crossed over to other areas of my life. I feel stronger, sexier and happy with myself because I am sticking to an exercise routine for the first time in my life! Start this workout & you'll never want to stop dancing!",1232668800,2,1347,5.236111111111111
8306782,5,B001GQRWZ8,"I absolutely love this DVD and am currently using it every second day to help alleviate a back problem and to regain lost fitness and technical finesse due to an injury. Jannelle simply works you out (though I am loathe to use the word workout) much harder and more effectively than you realize. I find this DVD improves my technique, gets my heart rate up and makes me smile and feel beautiful. She is a clever and caring instructor with a direct line to the goddess and a sweet and gentle determination of spirit which she disseminates to her students. I highly recommend purchasing this and look forward, in anticipation, to the next one she has out. My only regret is that I don't live in New York and so am unable to attend her classes in person. Overall, this is exceptional and I wish Jannelle continued success and prolific expansion.
May the shimmy be with us all...always!",1232409600,,882,4.5886075949367084
8306783,5,B001GQRWZ8,This is a great video for all those who want to learn the basics of Middle Eastern dance.  Jannelle breaks down some of the basic moves that every student should know in the first half of the DVD from hip drops to shimmys.  The second half of the DVD provides combines dance moves for a great cardio workout.  Definately a must have!,1230076800,,333,4.338709677419355
8306784,5,B001GQRWZ8,"This is a excellent instructional DVD, I found the instructions are clear and easy to follow along.  After a few practice sessions, I was able to follow along with the isolation.  The cardio is absolutely amazing!  I enjoy the workout.  The Cardio is so much fun you forget you are actually working out.  Purchasing this DVD is a really good bang for your bucks.",1223424000,,362,4.59375
