Now I realize that it was a different time and things like incest would have been very controversial, but V.C. Andrews didn't leg that stop her. If you have never read the book then I can see how this movie can be very good, but if you had read the book then you know this was a very poor substitute. The first time I saw it I hadn't read the book but once I did read it, I can see how lifetime's version was much better.

530946,3,6302970040,"***Some Spoilers Herein***  I saw the film before I read the novel by V.C. Andrews (who appears briefly as a maid, and who died before the movie was released), so I wasn't as disappointed as fans of the novel were when I initially viewed it as a preteen. Of course, it pales in comparison but it does boast some decent performances, nice cinematography and locations, as well as a haunting score.

Most are probably familiar with the general plot, and while it must be said that both Kristy Swanson (aged 16 at the time) and Jeb Stuart Adams (approximately 25 years old during filming) are too old for the roles of the two oldest children, Cathy and Christopher, they make their characters believable. Because the general incest sub-plot was edited out of the theatrical cut of the film, due to negative reaction at a test screening, the viewer is left wondering just how deep the connection is between Cathy and Christopher. A few scenes are suggestive and leave an impression that more is going on. Also, early in the story, there appears to be some jealousy from the children's mother, Corinne (Victoria Tennant) over Cathy's relationship with her father (Marshall Colt) but again, it is not really expanded upon. Corinne was disinherited and fell out of favor with her parents (Louise Fletcher and Nathan Davis) due to marrying her half-uncle, and following her husband's tragic death, must take her children to beg forgiveness and hope to inherit some of the family's wealth. Cathy, Christopher and the twins, Cory (Ben Ryan Ganger) and Carrie (Lindsay Parker), are virtually imprisoned in a far away wing of the mansion, known as Foxworth Hall, so that Corinne can endear herself to her dying father once more. Her pious, evil, nasty mother terrorizes her grandchildren, through starvation, physical and emotional torture (again, not overly graphic) and Corinne lets the wealth and privilege go to her head and decides that her offspring would only be in the way of her new life. This leads to tragedy.

The title is derived from the ""special place"" where the children try to make the best of a terrible situation; the spacious attic where they make a garden of paper flowers. It is also symbolic of the innocence, freedom and beauty of the outside world that was denied to them.

The novel is set primarily in the south, possibly Virginia, but most of the film was shot at an estate in Massachusetts, which is an interesting double but lacks the ""southern Gothic"" atmosphere of the book. While the novel takes place in the 1950s, the movie is very much a product of its time - 80s glam and yuppie sensibilities. The ending was also re-shot and feels abrupt, especially if you know how the novel ends.

Louise Fletcher is terrific as the menacing grandmother; Victoria Tennant is decent for the most part as the mother whose motives are (rightly) questionable, Kristy Swanson makes the role of Cathy her own, Jeb Stuart Adams, well, it's easy to see why so many teenage girls had a crush on him after his film. Ben Ryan Ganger and Lindsay Parker are adorable. It's a shame that the director's cut and alternate footage has not been released.

Not a bad little horror film, and it's still better that the Lifetime TV movie, despite the inclusion of the incest theme.

(Note on this DVD release: the print is exactly the same as the Anchor Bay DVD from 2001. It has a new (improved) menu and contains a different trailer than on the previous DVD version, though).",1478908800,3,3467,4.7683333333333335

I suspect there are many children whom are treated the same way these children are treated and no one knows about them.  Society doesn't care about anything or anyone except for the preservation of its own disease that society refuses to offer a cure for.  This movie doesn't offer any graphic details about incest, but does make comments.  Its not the incest that is so sick about the movie, its the poisons that they give it's own children to kill them to preserve what the family or ""mother"" wanted so selfishly.  Like the American Dream its people are only interested in self indulgence and provides no cures for the poor and weak of it populous.

Directed By: Jeffrey Bloom
1987; Running Time: 87 minutes

Four children's lives are turned upside down when their father tragically dies in a car accident and their family is left broke.  Their mother takes them to live with her rich parents, but ends up locking them away in the attic while trying to win back the affection of her father and gain the inheritance she feels she's entitled to.  This isn't the faithful adaptation of the V.C. Andrews novel that it should have been.  It is filled with lots and lots of little differences (here, Cathy's hair is cut by the grandmother rather than gummed up with tar, the mouse is named Fred rather than Mickey, Cory is found asleep in the attic rather than accidentally locked in a trunk, etc.) and big ones too (for example, the inappropriate relationship between the two oldest siblings is only barely hinted at, and there's the outrageous ending which I won't spoil for those who haven't seen this yet).  The performances are generally good, particularly Louise Fletcher as the evil grandmother, and though he doesn't have a single line, Alex Koba as creepy butler John.  Victoria Tennant overdoes it a little as Corinne.  Adorable Ben Ganger steals the show as Cory.  Blink and you'll miss V.C. Andrews in a quickie cameo as a maid washing a window.  Highly recommended, but it's best enjoyed by putting the book (if you've read it) out of your mind.

Also, a word of warning for those looking to purchase this film on DVD.  Try and avoid the edition put out by Top Ten New Media Production Limited.  I was sucked in by the nifty cover art, and got stuck with a dud.  This print is muddy and dark, making seeing details--even in daylight scenes--difficult.  Plus, something's up with the soundtrack.  The beautiful, haunting score is jittery in spots, and some of the actors' voices sound unnaturally high-pitched.",1452124800,2,1948,4.842900302114804
531069,3,6302970040,"Dad dies. Mom takes kids back to her parents home which is a mansion she never spoke of. She said she is going back to get her father's favor so she will inherit his money. They were penniless after the husband/dad died. From there you are told of the dark family secrets and craziness ensues.

The creep factor starts from the get-go in this strange movie and stays with it until the end. I remember seeing parts of this movie back after it was released but never the the beginning to the end. There was some weird creepy girl that I went to school with who had read the book well before it came out and was all too eager to ramble about the role of ""incest"" in her critiques of the movie. Oddly she grew up to be a psychiatrist. Wounder what would made an odd duck like her want to get into people's thoughts? Oh well. I digress.

Speaking of incest. I love how everyone says that there is no ""incest"" in this movie. The entire premise around how the daughter/mother was disinherited to begin with is because of incest. There is the strange way the father touches his daughter when he is alive while the mother is watching secretly through the door. The strange way the old father touches his daughter. The creepy way the kids are toward one another. Incest is all around.

The only problem I have with this movie is that they try to make Christians out to be wackos with the mother/grandmother reciting something that resembles Biblical passages and the kids trying to justify their mistreatment by reciting something that resembles Biblical passages. It was all too common back then.

Also I hate when the girl gets her hair cut off they throw this wig on her that resembles nothing like her hair in color or texture. It reminds me of the 70s when they the stunt doubles put on the laugh out loud wiry wigs in their scenes. Just lazy production/filming.

If you haven't watched this movie you should stop reading here . . .

Lastly the ending was a little strange. If someone poisoned by sibling, tried to kill me and my other siblings, locked me in an attic and starved me, lied to me, abused me, etc the last thing I would do when I ""got free"" was to go in a room full of them. I would run for freedom. Then go back and confront them. I think any human would. But this is a movie. So someone needed them to tell them off I guess. Dunno. Just seemed kinda contrived.",1448496000,,2371,4.352941176470588

531147,2,6302970040,"Being a ""Flowers in the Attic"" fan for well over a decade now, I must say, I was shocked when I discovered there was a 1987 movie adaptation that I had never heard of. Sadly, after watching it all the way through, I now know why it never caught my attention or was mentioned/recommended to me before.

This movie was soooooo disappointing. It really ruined such a beautiful, gothic story that was (for its time) written and told so cleverly. The movie dropped some of the most captivating themes of the book.

In this film, they have completely missed the point of the entire story: It wasn't just about 4 lazy blonde haired, blue eyed siblings sitting in a dusty and abandoned attic waiting to die, be killed or be let out like it is portrayed here; it was also about 4 siblings adapting to a terrible situation which causes them to break under the stressful and nightmarish circumstances they are under and give into sin and temptation. Therefore they are forced to grow up too quickly as their innocence is stolen from them, and the heartbreaking, psychological consequences of losing a father through death and a mother through greed and vanity.

The children: Chris, Cathy, Carrie and Cory are all supposed to be drop dead gorgeous, like living dolls, but the actors chosen to play the characters were just mediocre attractive; the kids were all cute in their own way, but they were a far cry from the angelic, flawless children described in the book and had zero character development. The character of Cathy is supposed to be a fairly well trained ballet dancer, yet the film completely leaves out this aspect that makes up for half of her character in the book. Almost Cathy's entire existence revolves around ballet, so to drop that element of the original character is blasphemy!

The relationship between Cathy and Chris? I know having an incestuous relationship develope between brother and sister played out in film is risque, but don't bother making a movie based off of a book if you're not going to stick to the most important and memorable events that take place in the plot of the story. Good Grief!

May I also say, this is some of the worst acting I've ever seen.

Overall, I think the imagery and scenery chosen for the movie was beautiful. The estate chosen for Foxworth Hall was breathtaking; and the Attic was exactly what I had pictured in my head when reading the book. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.",1428624000,,2431,4.694835680751174

531303,1,6302970040,"Who would have thought that a Lifetime movie remake could be better than the original? I sort of did things backwards when it comes to ""Flowers in the Attic""... I saw the Lifetime movie version first, and was so intrigued I read the book (and am currently on the third book in the series). I decided I'd like to see the original movie, to see how it compared to the Lifetime version. Well, I was sorely disappointed. While I can  understand the need to tone down the theme of incest that was one of the main focuses of the book, this film was still rated ""PG-13"", and for the late 80's, I think they played it too safe. Cutting a main theme from the book that carries on and shapes them into who they are in the rest of the series doesn't make sense. In addition to that, the whole ending was drastically changed, and not for the better. I understand it was ""based on"" the book, but honestly this could have been a standalone movie having nothing to do with the book, except for the fact that the children were locked in an attic - and even then, this film failed to convey the tragedy, the length of time, the loneliness, the sickness, the hate and also the love that grew in that attic over the three years and 4 months they were in there. Overall, I'd say give this one a miss and go straight for the Lifetime version, which surprisingly did this story much more justice.",1409443200,,1374,4.305019305019305

531321,5,6302970040,"The movie is a classic 80s fairy-tale. It has hauntingly pretty music throughout the film, clunky music to show danger, and Gothic-esq  filming. Despite it's fairy-tale nature I felt it was grounded in the fear of the children about their future. It could sound easy just to leave, but their mother has never seemed to work before and apparently they didn't have any savings. Where could they go? A homeless shelter? Maybe the fact that the world is not kind to the poor made them stay, despite the abuse.

This family grows on you. You learn to love them, to miss their happy memories for them. Some of the financial woes that kept them with a grandmother who had a twisted view of scripture was something I related too, so maybe it's not only other aesthetics but just me being able to relate to the mistreated hostages/children that made this movie unforgettable.",1402617600,6,866,4.690789473684211

531325,5,6302970040,"I know this film leaves out a lot from the book, just from what others have said or written (i've never actually read it myself--I'm not much of a novel-reader, takes too long). I was thinking perhaps the Lifetime Original Movie version might be more inclusive. It did include the incest as part of the story & people have said that that's in the novel (as a quickly forgiven rape).. Overall, the Lifetime version is probably a better, more comprehensive version of the story. However, in comparing the two, what stands out so much to me about this 1987 version is that the storytelling is quite memorably cinematic & the performances are indelibly creepy & ominous. As far as having the mother killed off, even when she was included in sequel novels, well, movie sequels are rarely that good, so I'm fine with the film's ending (Victoria Tennant's performance & the way the wedding scene is written make me despise Corinne so much, anyway, that I find this eminently satisfying). What many people probably don't realize is that this film was originally set to be written & directed by Wes Craven, who had a script ready, but it was rejected. He'd apparently stayed much closer to the novel (even including the incest, though, instead of a quickly forgiven rape, as consentual sex, which I think is a much creepier & more effective approach) The Lifetime version actually did get the consentual incest included, so that's probably its most impressive feat. The Lifetime version is not too compelling, though. Except for Ellen Burstyn as the grandmother, it feels rather miscast & the performances are fairly weak, but the real problem is that it looks & feels more like a soap opera, which, I guess, is what one might expect from a Lifetime movie, whereas the 1987 feature film version, as rushed as some people feel it is compared to the novel, hits many of the right buttons as far as I'm concerned, though it might've tried to include the Chris & Cathy incest as well, since it was such a big part of the story. It does include grandmother telling how Corinne married her uncle &, well, don't know if it's in the novel, but a viewer might get the feeling that Corinne had something to do with the ""accident"" that killed her husband, since she seems to be getting the impression that he might try to put the moves on Cathy. Wow, it really does sound like an insane soap opera, doesn't it? The film is done well enough, though, that it plays like a dramatic horror film. Perfect film choice for anyone with a dysfunctional, conniving, manipulative, lying mother &/or a religious fanatic, dictatorial, prudish, guilt-tripping grandmother.",1401494400,4,2638,4.762008733624454

531473,2,6302970040,"I first noticed this movie as a coincidence. I was looking for something to pass time with and I thought this would be a nice entertainment for the evening. I have to admit that I thought the beginning was dull and *too* perfect. A family of attractive young blonde members with a nice home and a cozy lifestyle what can be better? Such perfection bores me. However, things started picking up after the oh not so tragic and sudden father's death due to what again? I can't remember, I just recall the scene in which the news is being broken to the wife by the police officer while she's preparing that surprise party for him is incredibly cheesy. I'm not saying things got better after that, they actually became gradually worse but at least they weren't as annoying they were just bad.

Whatever her name is the mother of four young children all blonde, good looking and she's too young to be the mother of two teenagers and two young twins. Anyways, their mother loses everything after the death of their father so she runs back into her parents house whom we are told are very rich in order to support her family because she's too lazy and princess like to take a job and support herself, plus there's no way little miss billionaire can live a tight life of little to no spending God forbid! The only problem is her parents hate her for running away and marrying the father of her children and so they made no contact whatsoever ever since before her children were even born. Now, she needs to win her father's approval back in order for him to sign the inheritance to her, making her his only heir and filthy rich. After much whining and abuse from her mother who suggests locking the kids in the attic away from everyone else, and feeding them at certain times a day like prisoners. The father finally forgives their mother but only if she had no kids from her dead husband and what do you know? She decided to tell him she had none, goes around partying all week, forgets about her kids and leaves them to her cold heartless mother. The kids get trapped in the attic for a whole two years and their mom never keeps her promise by letting them out even after her father's death. Instead she remarries, poisons her children with sweets which leads to one of the twins dying and completely abandons them while they're still locked in that attic. Appears to be the two older kids who experience puberty while being locked together also develop feelings for each other and sooner than later commit insect :S I didn't know what was up with that but I guess the writer of the story was trying to make a point by saying never lock your kids in together for a very long time or else... How else would you explain that sickly twist?

Overall, the story made little to no sense. The kids were locked in because their mother wanted them to even after her father died she still continued to make sure they never went anywhere. I don't understand why. We never get a valid explanation for why their mother behaved the way she did towards her kids. Is it because she felt she's not capable of raising them after her husband died? Or is it because she was truly evil? Everyone in this movie and I mean all the adults involved except their dead father is evil. The kids were getting child abuse over the entire course of the film and we the audience never understood why.

I wish the plot and the motives were a little bit clearer, Also the characters I found were very silly and cartoonish. The acting was average at best. Thank God the movie has ended quickly and didn't drag on that renders the 1 star I gave, the second is I found the settings pretty. Other than that this movie is depressing and meaningless.

The look and feel of the movie is exactly as it should be. Also, Louise Fletcher and Victoria Tennant played their parts to perfection. The only real complaint I have nowadays is the ending. Killing off the mother, made it impossible to continue the franchise. Since she wasn't dead at that point of the V.C. Andrews saga, it made it impossible to ever do a sequel.

True, some of the acting is a little melodramatic, but I enjoyed the story. Some of the performances, (especially little Cory, played by Ben Ryan Ganger), will haunt you.

531600,2,6302970040,"Well, I didn't read the book as many of those leaving reviews have stated, nor did I read all 200+ reviews.  My review will be based solely on the movie.

This movie aired on a local channel but I only caught the middle of the movie.  Intrigued by the plot and ending, I bought it so I could  see the beginning and the end.  Wow!  Had I seen the beginning OR the end before hand, I would never have wasted my money on this one!

What I didn't like:
1. The relationship between the oldest daughter and father, even though briefly addressed in the movie before he was killed, felt very incestuous.  That was creepy!
2.  The relationship between the oldest daughter and son--both appeared to be mid to upper teens and attractive---also felt incestuous! Also creepy!!  It seemed inappropriate for the brother to be in the room where his teenage sister is bathing, to sit and watch her bathe and to wash her back for her.  Uggh!  Perhaps even a little weird for them to be sleeping in the same bed, but at least that appeared to be innocent.
3. Once again it felt incestuous for the mother of these children to be slowly undressing in front of HER bed-ridden father, with her mother standing by watching.  The viewer didn't know a lashing was about to take place by the mother, in front of the father, while the adult daughter was in her underwear or less.
4.  As if to confirm the incestuous nature of this film, it comes out that the mother had run off and married her uncle??
These observations beg the question: Did Woody Allen direct this movie??

A mother poisoning her children...a mother abandoning her children who were locked away in the attic...a mother who was pursuing a future for herself knowing she would have to kill her 4 children in order to have her new life...a grandmother who was abusive and cruel to her grandchildren.  Perhaps it was bad acting on the part of the mother of the children because she appeared in the beginning to be a very loving and attentive mother who truly loved her children, who turned her back on her parents and their fortune at her first opportunity because she recognized they were evil people--or so it seemed--until the end of the movie when you realize  she is no different than her bazaar parents.  It also left me wondering: did she actually have her husband killed way back at the beginning of the movie?  I like movies with suspense but not movies where mothers will kill their own children or movies that are filled with innuendos of incest so frequently.",1386547200,3,2508,4.533333333333333

Also in the book the mom (Corrine) starts out as nice and slowly turns into a baddie...in the film she's a bit odd right from the start....probably because they don't have time to show the amount of charahter development they would in the book. In the book the relationship between Christopher and Cathy become inscestuos and quite disturbing....there is a massive twist to Christopher's characher...but none of this happens in the film although there are hints towards it, but it never actually materialises...I get the feeling that was meant to happen in the film but maybe they took those scenes out as the charachters were so young and it also involves a rape episode in the book.

I'll give te good points first Louise Fletcher made a good preformence as th evil grandmother, there were a few nice scenes like the escape attempt, and the attic was really creepy. Other then that everything about it sucked.
 Kristy Swanson and Jeb Stuart Adams are too old for their roles. The mother over acts and the viewer never really fells Cornie is trying to do best by her kids. Poor editing leads to the story moving way to fast and you feel like the kids are in the attic for the run time of the movie not for years.
 Also there is no coming of age for Chris and Cathy. And no incest. This is a very importat part of book, and is not here.
And the ending WTF was that????? Killing Cornie???? How could you make Petals on the wind without Cathy confronting Cornie. The directer here walked off the set rather then flim that and I do not blame him. I just pray that this movie is re-made to be closer to the book.

Unfortunately, this is the most pathetic ""movie based on a novel"" I have seen, and does not follow the book very well.  The mouse in the novel is named ""Mickey"" not Fred-as the movie portrays.  Small detail, I realize.  However, further, more important details in the book are also not followed in the movie.  That is, Corrine, the mother, does NOT hang herself at her second wedding, as is portrayed in the movie.  The mom does not die until later on in the series, and it was not by hanging.  I wish there would be a more modern, updated, accurate portrayal of this novel series-which could prove to be in several parts if the script actually followed the novels, and could be one worth watching.

531848,3,6302970040,"Adapting a book to film isn't as simple as using the book as the movie script.  Some ideas simply don't translate well to the big screen, especially if you have less than 2 hours to develop all of your characters, tell the story, and reach a resolution.  So film makers inevitably have to cut corners and modify the story to make a movie that can be understood and enjoyed by people who haven't even read the book.  That's what they did here.  And as a movie in and of itself, I thought they did a good job.

The book ""Flowers in the Attic"" isn't just a horror story of 4 kids locked away in an attic by their zealot grandmother.  It weaves a complex tale about mixed relationship roles in a family, as the lines blur between father/brother, mother/sister, spouse/sibling, and parent/grandparent.  It's also the first book in a series, and the ending doesn't offer much of a resolution.  The bottom line is that there is simply no way you can cram that whole book into a 90 minute movie.  The character development would have been extremely rushed and confusing, and the film might have even gotten an NC-17 rating at the time with the incest.  The writers obviously knew this, though I guess the 1-star reviewers here don't.  I suppose they could have alternatively tried adopting it into a mini-series, but I don't know if they would have been able to keep new viewers tuning in week after week.

So the writers instead cut out the incestuous complexities of the brother/sister relationship, and added a resolution which the book doesn't have.  Does this sacrifice a lot of the parallel stories in the book?  Sure.  But again, I don't know how else you could have turned this into a 90 minute movie.  All things considered, they did a decent job.  I have no shame in saying I even liked the movie's ending more than the book's passive ending.",1285632000,13,1844,4.573170731707317

Isn't that why we have movies, a book squeezed onto a screen with only the ""good"" parts?

It seems the overall consensus is that this was a bad movie, but it was, and is, good, for those of us who find the meaning, the dark humor, and the camp.

It was the movie that led me to the book and all books by VC Andrews (and her ghostwriters) and I have been hooked ever since. I find the movie as interesting and captivating now as I did then. No, the movie does not show a brother raping his sister as it happened in the book and no the ending is not the same. However, because the movie was clearly written as 1 film instead of a series, the ending of the movie was exciting and quite enjoyable to watch considering what Corrine put her children through. In fact, the only signficant difference from the book is the ending and the lack of incest. All of the fear, sickness, death, anger and attitudes of the characters were spot on. I get the same reactions now that I did when I first saw the movie: compassion for the children (especially Cory and Carrie), pity and then rage towards Corrine, complete disgust for the Grandmother and a feeling of vindication for the remaining children at the end.

While I am a tremendous fan and have read almost all the books, I find the incest parts a little awkward whenever I read them and I have always hated that Cathy and Chris couldn't get past their feelings so it did my heart good to not see any of that splashed across the screen. I find it ironic, and a little strange, that people are so angry that we don't get to see them getting it on like in the book.

Also, keep in mind that although the book may be in a completely different class than the book, it is interesting to see a different interpretation (like two sketches of the same form: one a Monet, the other a child's drawing).

The Dollanganger family is extremely happy. Mom, Dad, and four precious children (all with names starting with ""C"") are the picture of perfection, until on dad's birthday he does not come home. Dad has died, and now the family is in shambles. After selling everything they own, mom decides to take the kids to her parent's mansion. Relatives they have never met and a creepy isolated mansion with even creepier help, make for a very uncomfortable homecoming. The kids find out that in order to for their mother to win back her father's affection (and fortune) they cannot exist in the house, so they are locked away in the attic. A stern grandmother makes them even more uneasy ... apparently some family secrets make it impossible for her to love her own grandchildren. Things go from bad to worse as mother's visits become more infrequent and grandmother stops feeding them. The kids want to love their mother, but also realize the insanity of the situation. How will they escape, and what will become of their little family?

I thought this was an average film. A creepy gothic film is executed well with this plot. The acting was decent, definitely creepy, by all involved. The scenery was apt. There was nothing stellar in this film, but it is definitely not that bad. And the film did leave a lot to the imagination, so I will be reading the books to fill in the gaps.

531988,1,6302970040,"V.C. Andrews created quite a controversial gothic story with the Dollaganger series, which began with the incredible Flowers in the Attic.  The novels were very successful, and it didn't come as a surprise that a movie version was released in 1987.  But what was the point of making the film if it would not follow the main themes found in the book?

I won't go into detail about the plot.  If you've read the book, then you know what it's about.  This film was meant to be a standalone (the other four books would not be made into films), and some changes had to be made.  Cathy (Kristin Swanson) and Chris (Jeb Stuart Adams) are a few years older in the film, as are the two younger kids.  The ebb and flow had to be different and the ending had to be changed so that there would be no cliffhangers.  All of that was understandable.  But what about the nature vs. nurture theme?  The grandmother (Louise Fletcher) is a religious fanatic, hates her daughter Corrine (Victoria Tennant) for marrying her half-uncle, and sees her daughter's offspring as ""devil's issue.""  It is an irony that Cathy and Chris end up doing the very things their grandmother abhors because they get locked up together in a room with an attic, with no one but each other, playing mom and dad to their younger siblings for three years.  Yet none of this happens in the film.  Well, you get the vanilla version of it.  This is a run-of-the-mill gothic story with some bad acting combined with some very cheesy dialogue.  The worst acting goes to Tennant.  The woman had a blank expression throughout the film.  I've seen mannequins who show more emotion than she does.  The only great part about this film is V.C. Andrew's one-second long cameo appearance as a window-cleaning maid.  This film is simply awful.  Do yourself a favor: if you haven't read Flowers in the Attic and its four follow-ups, watch this film first, then read the books.  You'll thank me later.",1251504000,,1941,4.600583090379009
531989,5,6302970040,"The only people criticizing this movie are those that read the book and feel that the movie came up short in comparison.  I have news for you- the movie is going to be inferior to the book *every single time* no matter WHAT type of movie it is.  Horror, drama, suspense, you name it.  The book is going to be better, that's a fact.

That's why whenever you're planning to see a movie version of a book, you better lower your expectations by quite a lot.

With THAT out of the way, Flowers in the Attic is a shocking story.  It's about four kids that are forced to live inside an attic while their wicked old grandmother with all her many delightful little mental problems does a below average job taking care of them as she keeps them trapped and unable to leave the house.

The interesting thing about the story is that later on, the kids find a way to free themselves from the room, and the grandmother doesn't seem to care a whole lot about that.  But oh BOY- don't have a brother and sister sleeping together in the same bed or all heck will break loose!

The butler is another character in the film.  He tries to be scary by never saying a word and walking around with a mean face, but he's just as much of a coward as the grandmother.  He's just as heartless too.

There's a spoiler near the end involving one of the kids that shocked me a little.  It's shocking because of the mothers reaction to it.

The GREAT storyline twist gradually starts revealing itself near the end involving the mother.  I didn't see THAT coming.  I'll leave it at that.

I watched this with 3 other ""Flowers"" fans and we all hated it.  It's nothing like the book and...SPOILER ALERT...she never kills her mother...not ever in the series of books...so killing her in the move!?...That part was total B.S.! The only good thing about this movie was casting Louise Fletcher as the grandmother...other than that it all blows!

I feel like several others here and wish they'd make a decent mini-series of the ""Flowers in the Attic"" books.

By the way...the real V.C Andrews died in 1986 and never wrote half the books printed in her name. The last two she wrote were ""Garden of Shadows"" (the final ""Flowers"" book actually a prequel) and ""Fallen Hearts"" (part of the Heaven series) Most of the stuff written by the ghost writer is crap. But that's just my personal opinion. Anyone with any sense can read the books and immediately know who wrote what. Andrews had a very definite style that wasn't copied well by her ghostwriter...

At least in the film, you really got the sense that they were trapped and while the actors are older than the ones in the book I actually like Kristy Swanson (despite the horrid movie version of Buffy) and she captured Cathy for me.  The radically changed ending is important for the film version because it gives the viewer a sense of closure while the books continue on.

532042,5,6302970040,"The scariest thing about Flowers in the Attic, is that the novel by V. C. Andrews has sold billions of copies. For anyone who somehow missed the book, this is a story of four very blond children - a couple of strapping teens named Cathy (Kristy Swanson) and Chris (Jeb Adams), who like to sleep in the same bed and keep the bathroom door open. And then there's the little twinsies, Carrie (Lindsay Parker) and Cory (Ben Ganger). Their mother's name is Corinne (Victoria Tennant). If they have a cat, it is most likely named `Cat'.

This cute clan is disrupted by the death of father, whereupon Tennant takes them back to the family manse, from whence she was kicked out 17 years ago, after marrying her own uncle! She plans to regain the love of her dying father and inherit his fortune. (Apparently applying for a job and joining the workforce just never entered into the equation).

The kids are locked in a spacious bedroom and treated with extreme cruelty by their grandmother Louise Fletcher, who must have studied Piper Laurie's every move in Brian DePalma's ""Carrie"". (It's a shame she didn't notice the subtleties in that performance as well. Her acting is so over-the-top, if she had a black moustache, she would twirl it.) She calls them ''devil's spawn'' and goes so far as to trim Cathy's blonde locks. (oh no!)

The children spend most of their time in the attic - which they get to through a secret door in their room. It is here that their eyes grow cavernous - apparently from too much makeup. But what really gets to the kids is the realization that mother Tennant has been sprinkling arsenic on their cookies. (This makes Tennant a hero in our opinion as these children are so annoying and stupid, poisoning falls into the category of mercy killing.) But enough of this, lest, as little Cory, who eats more cookies than is good for him, puts it, ''We'll have to thwow up.''

Incestuous desires run rampant in the original novel, but the movie,written and directed for minimum impact by Jeffrey Bloom, only offers soft-focus innuendo. Stripped of its metaphorical trimmings, the sublimely ridiculous plot reduces the viewer to laughter more than tears.

On second thought, the scariest thing about this movie is that the original novel was followed by more horticultural horror sequels, ''Petals on the Wind,'' ''If There Be Thorns'' ''Seeds of Yesterday'' and ''Garden of Shadows.'' to name but a few.

Could there still be bitter fruit to come? . . .Now that's the REAL horror!",1197763200,5,2496,4.752886836027714
532043,3,6302970040,"Yes, I have never read the book from which this film is based on. I saw it for the first time in 1995 or 1996 when I was 5 or 6 in Poland. To remember such a film from that many years ago is impressive. You know the filmmakers did something right. From start to finish Flowers in the Attic is a shockingly enjoyable movie that is not easy to sit through. While the beginning of the film is seemingly dull and the characters are too one-dimensional, the heart of the movie is supposed to kick in when the children arrive at their grandmothers creepy mansion. Though all actors do a decent job with the harsh material, there is very little to be happy with watching a nasty grandmother lock her 4 grandkids in room and feed them poisoned doughnuts. The real reason for liking this movie as much as I do is only based on the fact that these movies don't get made anymore. Victoria Tennant and Louise Fletcher give their best but the story is flawed from the start. Since the movie relies so much on the happenings to the kids once they are imprisoned, the writers needed to deepen the story with the mother and the kids to see what really went on when the kids were in the attic. You feel almost betrayed to see a woman go from visiting her kids from time to time hugging them to sprinkling their food with a posion she knows will kill them eventually. By the time the ""twist"" is revealed in the end, you almost don't care. People usually don't like to feel like their hopes of a more pleasant ending were never going to come true and this is the case here. To give the mother a more humane reason to do what she does would have given the film not only depth but would have made the final scenes (truly amazingly shot though the actual events are ludicrous) effective and meaningful. Flowers in the Attic gets points for shock value and taking risks, but you only get one side of the story and since the mother is so vital in the storyline, it makes no sense why the viewer only sees her 15 minutes in a 1:30 movie. 3/5",1193443200,2,2016,4.266318537859008
532044,2,6302970040,"and you'll think this is a better-than-average made-for-TV (even though it wasn't) movie, and you'll appreciate the book even more.

Let's start with the cons:  The book was set in the late 1950's (around 1957, I think, and I know I'm comparing to the book, but bear with me), whereas the movie is set in present-day.  This presents many problems.

Just an aside:  ""A Walk to Remember"" by Nicholas Sparks was set in 1958 and when it was translated to the screen, it lost a lot of its charm because it was set in the present.  There's just a certain charm about time past that cannot be duplicated in the here and now.

Anyway, fast-forwarding the book about thirty years, it lost something.  The children would have been much more innocent, but then again, Jeb Stuart Adams and Kristy Swanson were MUCH too old for the roles.  I know they were supposed to be older going into the attic than they were in the book (I am guessing Chris and Cathy are the same age going into the attic in the movie as they were coming out in the book), but Jeb Adams was twenty-seven, and he looked it.  And am I the only one who noticed the children more resembled displaced Amish children (Chris wears suspenders and what was with Cathy and those dowdy dresses?) than the Dresden dolls they were supposed to be?

These children did not look Aryan enough--yes, they had blond(e) hair, though I didn't notice any blue eyes, and Cory's curly hair made him look Jewish (which would have been fine, if this was a story about Jewish children, but it wasn't), neither were any of these children stunning; they were all rather ordinary looking (Kristy Swanson was somewhat pretty, at least before her hair got chopped off).  Though Victoria Tennant is elegant and attractive (but not as) in a Grace Kelly sort of way, she looked a bit tired.  As for the father, well, I imagined a much handsomer man (think Jeffrey Hunter with blond hair), but oh, well.

But it was the children's ages that were worse.  The twins were fine, but Chris and Cathy were post-pubescent in the movie, as opposed to pre-pubescent in the book (though Chris is fourteen in the book, he doesn't start growing hair in certain places until later), which explains why the children in the book held out for as long as they did before escaping.  It is much easier to control a fourteen-year-old boy than a boy old enough to serve in the military.

I think the worst scene of the film was when Chris and Cathy are on the bus in the daytime and Cathy is going on about how they never had a pet, about how they should have had one so they could get used to death, or some such nonsense as that, so that she would know that fathers die, even handsome, wonderful ones, too.  It was so totally pointless.

I also think the fact that they arrived at Foxworth Hall during the daytime and through the front door instead of in the dark of night through the back deflated some of the mystery.  The cinematography could have been darker in some places, lighter in others.  Instead, it always seemed like it had just rained.

We are given just a glimpse of what life was like, how sunny yellow it was, before Chris Sr.'s death.

I didn't really mind the ending with Corinne dying, being hung by her wedding veil, because I really do see a book and a movie made from it as two separate works of art.  That's how Margaret Mitchell felt about ""Gone with the Wind"".  Though I read somewhere a sequel was planned, I am not sure how they would have went about doing that as ""Petals on the Wind"" focused not only on Cathy's exciting and versatile love life, but on getting revenge on her mother.

Cathy's character was just totally different in the movie (and so was Carrie's--Carrie was a little spitfire in the book) and in leaving out the incest between Chris and Cathy, it lost something.  Chris was just blah and Cory was cute and all, but not much else.  The female characters dominated this film.

Overall, the movie was just a low-budget, lackluster production.

Now for the pros:  The haunting, chilling score (I'm still not sure how I feel about Cathy's narrating), and Louise Fletcher was perfect as the grandmother.  This flick is entertaining enough because when I watched it before I even knew of the book's existence, I was intrigued.  I've watched it twice since then and have the same opinion I've had since reading the book--that it could have been so much better, but better had it not been done at all.  What's in my imagination is better than anything they can put on film.  I've found the best movies are made out of bad books.

Watch it once or twice, maybe even a third time with a friend, but that's about it.  The book has much more readability.",1193097600,5,4694,4.492924528301887

532105,1,6302970040,"Flowers in the Attic (Jeffrey Bloom, 1987)

I wish I could say that Flowers in the Attic is the worst movie I've seen this year. Unfortunately, it is not, for I have been embroiled in a two-week crapfest the likes of which I would not wish on my worst enemy. With that frame of reference, when I say Flowers in the Attic is more of the same, hopefully you will understand.

The story, which was beloved of grammar school and junior high girls everywhere when I was a kid (it was THE cool book to have read when I was in fifth grade in 1979), but which may have faded into obscurity: there is a family. The father (Jagged Edge's Marhsall Colt) dies. Mother (La Peste's Victoria Tennant) takes the four kids-- Chris (Jeb Stuart Adams of The Goonies), Cathy (Kristy Swanson, the only Buffy the Vampire Slayer who really mattered), Cory (Ben Ryan Granger, who recently, before his seeming retirement, popped up in Ed Wood), and Carrie (Lindsay Parker, who enjoyed a few years of child stardom before scaling back to occasional guest performances)-- and heads off to the family homestead, run by the dying Grandfather (Nathan Davis, recently of Holes) and Grandmother (Louise Fletcher, most recently of The Last Sin Eater). However, Grandma tells the kids in no uncertain terms they're evil little beasties, since it seems mom and dad were related; Grandpa is not to know they exist, so Mom and Grandma keep them locked up in the northern wing of the mansion, where they develop their own little world-- except not everyone is content to leave them alone in it...

The original posters for the movie declared it had been written and directed by Wes Craven (facsimiles of them are included with the DVD); it should take the average viewer about two minutes to realize this isn't the case. Subsequently, Jeffrey Bloom took responsibility for this travesty, and (perhaps not coincidentally) did not work again in Hollywood, aside from an extremely short-lived TV show he produced and directed, for eighteen years. Yes, this movie is that bad. The novel is, of course, a genre potboiler, practically made for the purpose of being filmed, and yet the script (also written by Bloom) still manages to leave out large sections, both in the (seeming) interest of ""cleaning up"" the novel to get a more family-friendly rating and in order to streamline things, we assume. Unfortunately, the streamlining, as much streamlining does, gets rid of the vast majority of the stuff that gives the book any emotional impact whatsoever.

The acting is bloody well atrocious. I'm half-amazed any of the principals ever worked in Hollywood again, and completely amazed Kristy Swanson was actually nominated for an award for this (more so that she won!). I've seen less melodramatic soap operas.

There's really nothing else to be said-- if you never read the books, read them instead. If you did, don't see this, for you will end up hating everyone involved with a passion you didn't know you had. Absolutely awful. (half)",1176336000,5,2995,4.841796875

Flowers in the Attic is one of my all time favourite books, I read it as a child many times and it took a long time to track down and eventually see the film, I was so appalled i actually burst into tears when i did see it.

I understand that in the 80's films where a lot more censcored and maybe elaborating vital parts of the book (Cathy and Chris dealing with puberty/inscest etc.) but why the hell make a film about a book if your not going to do it properly? And why change the ending, why even use the name ""Flowers in the Attic"" when your just going to massacre everything that was good about the book, they should have called it. Seriously I don't know when Virginia Andrews died, but if she was still alive when this book was made I'm suprised she didn't sue the people that made it, and if she wasn't I hope she seeks revenge from beyond the grave.

532159,2,6302970040,"V. C. Andrews was one of my favorite authors when I was in high school - - and the ""Flowers in the Attic"" series was my absolute favorite.

Perhaps the ""Flowers"" story would have been better justified by a miniseries, or even an HBO series nowadays where they could deal with the adult material.  But back in the late '80s, this was what Hollywood offered us.

It's not that the movie is horrible, it's just not the book.  If that's what you're expecting, you will be disappointed.

The overall structure is pretty much the same as the book.  The Dollangangers live their perfect lives until the father dies in a car accident and the mother has no choice but to return home to her disapproving parents - - particularly the bitter, religiously zealous Grandmother.  Apparently the grandparents own a huge estate (Foxworth Hall)and much money and the children's mother is their sole heir.  The Grandmother has concoted a scheme to keep the children's existence from their grandfather, who is dying and who believes his daughter to be childless.  The children will live in an upstairs attic until their grandfather dies, at which time they will be released and able to live a life of luxury, as the Foxworth heirs.

Readers of the book will know that those plans go horribly awry - - and that Chris and Cathy, the two oldest children, forced to grow up together, fall in love with each other.

The movie touches on this very little - - probably because the filmmakers believed that moviegoers might not appreciate the incestous love between a brother and sister.  And while that might be true, it robs the ""Flowers"" story of its very backbone.

Another fault within the movie is that the movie itself doesn't show you how very long the children were locked up in the attic.  In the book, the children were locked up for over three years.  In the movie version, it feels as though the children were there for maybe a week. Other than the children looking somewhat haggard and pale, they don't appear to age and therefore, the viewer isn't truly horrified at the length of their incarceration.

The ending of the movie too, is completely different from the literary ""Flowers"".  While the first book spawned a handful of sequels, the movie obviously had to wrap things up.  So the film ending is very, VERY different from the book's ending.  Again, maybe a miniseries would have been better - - there would have been more time to develop the stories, to make the viewer really feel as though those children were locked up for an eternity -- and even to continue the story.

The acting is capable - -nothing standout either good or bad, in my opinion.  As one other reviewer mentioned, the kids' ages were a little off from the book but that's relatively minor stuff.  Louise Fletcher is as ferocious as the Grandmother as she is in some of her other roles and Victoria Tennant is chillingly convincing as the materialistic mother.

If you have read the ""Flowers"" series of books, you'd probably better skip this movie.  If not, pop the movie in and if you're entertained, you might want to start reading the series.",1142812800,10,3109,4.683241252302026

532163,3,6302970040,"i actually really enjoy this movie adapation of the books, but like a lot of reviewers, i would have liked it to have been moer faithful to the books. i will say that it isn't the worst book adaptation of a movie that i have seen.

this is my first review, and i have seen the movie & read the books several times, so i thought i would comment on what some of the other reviewers have said, about the differences in the book & movie versions.

i don't want to spoil too much, for newer fans of the books, that might not have seen the movie version yet, so am going to be careful, about how i talk about the plot.

this movie was made in 1987, and has a pg -13 rating. this is all just speculation on my part, but i believe a lot of the reason that the incest, was left out of this book, was due to the time at, that the movie was made.the movie being filmed in the late 80s, and having a huge teen girl following, was probably why a lot of the incest between the siblings was left out of the movie.

movies made 20 years ago, weren't to allowed as much as they are today, combined with the fact the studio that made, this probably wanted to make sure that some of the teen girls that were fans of the book series, could go see the movie. i am assuming, this was in a large part of why the incest was left out, especially because the movie only received a pg -13 rating. i am not saying that the movie should have had an r rating, just saying that the movie studio probably left a lot of the incest plot out, to ensure it got a pg -13 rating. i am also assuming that a movie studio in the 80s, probably didn't want to put out a mainstream movie with incest in it, probably afraid of a blacklash or something, though i do think if they were worried about all of that, they shouldn't have decided to make this movie in the first place.

i say the movie first, and i then later on read the book series. i agree the books are way better, though i don't think this is a bad movie, like i said earlier, and certainly isn't the worst book to be made into a film, if you consider why a lot of the plot changes were made in the movie.

i agree, like a lot of the reviewers that i would like to see a new movie version of this, that could include more of the plot of the books, possibly even film versions of the whole series. though, if that did ever happen, fans of the books would have to understand that in most movie versions of books, there are always a few changes.

i am honestly suprised that there hasn't been a new version of this movie, or other movies based on this authors books, due to the cult following that v.c. andrew's books have. the whole reason that this film is still so sought, after is because of that reason. i have noticed it has been shown on the starz movie channels, a lot, which i assume is for that reason.

even if a movie studio thought that the books would make too long of a move to show in the theatre, why not a tv miniseries? you could probably be a lot more faithful to the books in a tv miniseries, or more of the contreversial parts of the book (the incest which might turn off some people).",1136073600,,3123,4.050243111831443

Being a guy, that's pretty good considering this series was marketed to teenage girls. Every girl in my Junior High School was reading this book and it's sequals. So, I picked up the book out of idle curiosity and was entralled from the very beginning. The story just pulled me in and I couldn't put it down. In fact here it is 2005 and I'm reading it again for the first time in almost 10 years. It still holds up.

Now the movie...well it's just bad from the get go. I was so excited when this movie came out. I was in the theatre on the opening night and 90 minutes later I was swearing up a storm. My favorite book had been butchered. Beyond butchered. It had been totally murdered. Now, I can accept that in order to bring this to the screen that certain things had to be changed. The fact that V.C. Andrews was involved in writing the screenplay before she died gave me some hope that the movie would retain at least the best parts of the book. How wrong I was. The movie starts out almost like the book, but certain events are moved up. For instance, the age of the kids when their father dies is off by at least three years. Fine, that was ok. I could deal with it. However, when the mother and the kids walk up to Foxworth Hall and John Amos Jackson (the butler) answers the door to let them in, I knew that the story was going to go off into left field somewhere and never get back on the right track. I was right. After a few scenes that were somewhat faithful adaptations from the book, the story just shoots off into left field. I don't know what story they were trying to tell, but it certainly was NOT Flowers In The Attic. The only saving grace of this film was that there was no way for them to do a sequal. That is the only nice thing I can say about it.

They were designed to get us interested in reading, but looking back this was the scariest, let alone the cheapest, marketing tactic in history.

A family full of adorable, sweet tempered, cherubs is uprooted from their former happy life to live with their horrible Grandmother in a country estate following the death of their father in a car accident.  As they are broke and have no where else to go, the four children and their mother go to live with their reletives who they have had little to no contact with all their lives.  Grandma locks them in the attic and explains on no uncertain terms that they are to live there and not to get love from her, as they are the products of sin.  As it turns out their father and mother were actually uncle and neice, and all four children were the product of incest.  *YUCK!*  Naturally the Grandmother turns her nose up at these kids, but doesn't let her maternal instincts take over to forgive them for their parents' sins.  They are kept as prisoners in the home, their mother is mysteriously absent.  As it turns out, their mother is working at rebuilding her life and marrying well, hoping to eventually forget the four children and start afresh.  All the while the four kids are starving (one eventually dies), and plotting an escape from their prison.

Curiously enough, the movie version seems to skirt the implied incest that occurs between the oldest brother and sister.  Those who had never read the book might eventually pick up on it with some subtle hints (plus the fact that the Grandmother refuses to let them sleep in the same bed together).  I wonder why, as there would hardly have been a story without the presence of incest.

Sex always catches our attention, but incest?  Yikes!  This was before trash TV when incest was a dirty secret.  This movie was bad, but let's face facts, people, the book (let alone all those following to this day) was a trashy story then and is a trashy story now.  This movie was lousy, but the material they had to work with wasn't top notch.  It's not even bad enough to be campy, like the books are.

It seemed as though they tried to merge Flowers In The Attic With Petals On The Wind in a very haphazard way. Louise Fletcher turns in a terrible performance as the wicked grandmother who is supposed to torture the kids in the story, but it's pure fluff in this movie. Maybe she should've called on The Prophets to help her with this role. If Hollywood didn't want to be bothered with doing a movie for all 5 books in this series that's one thing, but get someone to not turn a marvelous piece of novel, and create slop for the pigs. I was disappointed with this version of the story as I feel that the director had no clue of what to do. I would even venture to say he didn't read the book. I would say the only time to watch this movie is if you can't afford a night out on the town, and there's nothing else on t.v. until ""While You Were Sleeping"".",1109462400,6,1018,4.1725888324873095

She tells the children it won't be for long but it ended up being several years. Four siblings are forced to share a bedroom and attic that becomes their playground. The Grandmother, knowing about the children, keeps the secret from her husband as well but is cold towards them, often hoping to find them in committing some sort of sinful act. She calls the children demon spawns being that they are the product of an uncle and niece. The children however and not evil but normal children trying to get along and survive on their own.

This is a very poor adaptation of the book but it may be up to the individual to decide if they like the movie or not. I can say for myself that I do not like it all that much but will watch it on occasion if I find it on tv. The movie is loosely based on the book and some parts simply don't match up, especially the ending which makes it seem like the three remaining siblings walk out the front door and live happily ever after once their mother dies.

Uh, no it's not, although I SUPPOSE it's possible that somewhere in the world, there were four children forced to live in an attic so their mother could inherit millions. Anyway, this movie is poorly edited, badly written, and unimaginatively directed, with only a few flashes of inspired acting. However, having said that, the movie is also very engrossing and involving, and like a bad accident, you can't take your eyes off of it once you start watching. It's clear from the choppy editing and short running time that scenes were removed, such as the incestuous love affair between the two oldest siblings and scenes involving the mother and her fiancee. How unfortunate that the DVD doesn't feature those deleted scenes... perhaps the movie would have been better if they hadn'd been deleted.",1104883200,2,894,4.811688311688312

In my opinion, things went at the right speed to convey the importance of each thing happening.  If you've read the series, be prepared to see that this is will not live up to that.  Try to have an open mind.  For me, the different ending was sort of cool.  It was different and added excitement.  It was something new and interesting for a book I had alreaady read.

The only character I thought seemed interesting was the grandmother. It seems like the script, the characters, just the whole movie was put together too sloppily and quickly.
My other problem with this movie is that it is not like the book at all. I was expecting a visual version of the book, but what I got was a movie based on the book with the same characters, basic plot, etc. They took some of the ideas from the book and changed them into something else.

  The story is about four beautiful children (Chris, Cathy, Carrie, and Cory), who are locked away in a room by thier selfish mother, with a filthy attic as their playground. Their cruel heartless Grandmother brainwashes the small children, Cory and Carrie, into thinking that they are ""devil's spawn"", and they are painfully malnourished. They live each day as if it were a year, sadly awaiting the truths that are to come from their greedy mother.
  This book will capture the tears from your eyes, as you feel the trials and triumphs of four helpless children, locked away without care.
  I recommend the rest of the dollanganger series from V.C. Andrews, from the escape from the attic; to the return; and thier lives still haunted by the house; and a Pre-quel.

The mother plays her cryptic ""evil or love"" part so well I wonder if she might be crazy in real life. The grandmother is played by Louise Fletcher who is my favorite actress of all time. She does a wonderful job of stirring your inner emotions that you almost want to reach through the screen and give her a good ""smackdown"". My rating is based on the film itself and not the book adaptation, so if you read the book you may be dissapointed. Book fans in most cases have already developed a movie in their mind, so this might come up short for you, but for the average thriller fan who hasn't read the book this film is a real treasure.

He also composed such scores as Sweet November, Spy Game and many hororr movies. The best way to get the music is to download it from a music sight.(Kazza) Many of times it will not show up, but if your patient I promise you will find it. One last thing, I also reccomend the extremely talented artist ""Danny Elfman."" His work is extremely similar. He has composed themes for Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, and Dolores Claiborne. Some other songs you would enjoy is the theme to ""Cider House Rules,""  ""Unfaithful"" and lastly ""plastic bag theme"" to the American Beauty Soundtrack.

The only positive thing is that the grandmother's role was acted superbly, but that in no way saves this travesty.
Flowers in the Attic should be made into a mini-series on A&E, they know how to be true to a book, such as Pride & Prejudice.
The incest was only implied and never went as far as it did in the book. You can make a movie telling what actually happended without being graphic. Granted no one wants to see incest but it was essential to the story. It really shows us the ramifications of the mother's action and how it forever scarred th lives these children.
As a movie itself, and if you've never read the book, the movie comes across as the Movie of the Week and the only reason you're watching it is to see what happens at the end.

532312,2,6302970040,"First off, I have to say that the movie barely even follows the same plot as the brilliant book. The were so many problems! In the book the oldest girl was supposed to be 12 when they came to the attic, in the movie she looks 15 or 16. In the book the grandmother didn't cut the oldest girls hair, she tried but Chris stopped her. And what happened to the incest? It carried such huge messages and themes in the book and in the movie there is none of it. I could go on for pages about the inconsistensies, even the ending is hugely different. I swear sometimes when they actually said something from the book I would think ""Hey! That's kinda like Flowers In The-...oh yeah..."". But to defend the makers of this movie a bit, this was before the entertainment industry relized how much it annoys people when they don't follow much loved books. I mean look at the 2 latest movies based on books, Lord Of The Rings and Harry Potter. They are two great books with movies that are good as well and stay true to them. I really wish they would remake the movie and have a movie for each book in the series. I think Flowers In The Attic was around 400 pages. When a 400 page book is squashed into an 85 minute movie it isn't pretty...But for a moment here lets forget about the book, now lets look at the problems with the stand alone movie. The acting was quite weak at times. Cory's voice was annoying but I actually respected that because it seemed more realistic. Another thing I like about the movie was how it showed that man digging the four graves, that was a very eerie well done scene. A shame it was only 4 seconds and the rest of the movie never had that eerie mood. A movie like this really should have that eerie mood. It all happened too fast. And you never got to know the characters well enough to feel bad for them. You never got to know the mother well enough to be shocked when the truth came out. Nothing was understood, there seemed to be a shortage of lines. And half the lines were chocked full of emotion that came to soon and too rushed. Instead of getting the feeling they were in the attic for years, you feel they were in the attic for 85 minutes, the time of the movie. It doesn't glide you from scene to scene, it puts more circles under the childrens eyes and tell you it's been a few months. And by skipping those few months we lose a lot of important dialoge and emotions that must have passed between the children. All in all you should really only watch this out of curiosity, not for entertainment, and not for a substitute of the book.",1010016000,48,2564,4.245398773006135

The marvelous Louise Fletcher is over the top and chilling as the grandmother and she seems more upset with herslef by taking this role than with the children. But even with all it's acting flaws this is one of the creepiest films ever made. The incestous relationship between the older siblings should have been played out more but it would have been too disturbing to watch on screen.

Sure, movies are going to be shorter than books, but the book was huge so the mvie should be abit longer than an hour and 30 minutes.  The things that really took away from the movie are:
1. The rushed things 2. Cory's extrememly annoying voice.  His voice is higher and squeiker than carries (his twin sister).  Sure he's only 4 or 5, but so was Carrie. 3. The different scenes.  So many important events that dind't take place in the movie or was changed completely unitl it was so mixed up it wasn't even funny. 4. Bart Winslow is suppose to be handsome but the man who played it was just-ew. 5. At the end what happened.  In the book NOTHING like that happened.  In fact the mother doesn't even die until Seeds Of yesterday (the 5th book) I think-I havemnt read that one and isn't finished with If There Be Thorns.
ZPlus sides: 1. The spooky music really plusses the movie's plots. 2. Christopher is very handsome.
I liked the movie but it deifniately could've been better- maybe it would have if VC Andrews had directed it or they at least followed the book.",994809600,4,1343,4.336
532339,2,6302970040,"I've read the book at least 5 times that I can recall, and when I first saw the movie my thought was ""cult hit, but, mainstream hit never.""  Almost nothing like V. C. Andrews wonderful book, leaving out almost everything including the ending.  The only reason I even give it 2 stars is because the musical score is hauntingly beautiful.",987033600,3,336,4.583333333333333
532340,3,6302970040,"The casting and acting is superb. So there's credit given where it is due.
However, the plot of this movie, when compared to the actual novel of the same name written by V. C. Amdrews, is just pathetic. The movie's ending stinks, the characters weren't developed hardly at all, and more than half of the things that happened in the attic were left out of the movie.
If I rated the movie based on the novel, it wouldn't even get one star. If you loved the movie, you would absolutely LOVE the book.",975974400,14,497,4.354838709677419
532341,3,6302970040,"I really did not want to see this movie the first time that I saw it. I reluctantly sat with my cousins, my sis, my bro, and a friend to watch it. During the film, I got really enthralled into the storyline. It was really sad when little Cory died.
Anyway, a few years later, I read the book. The movie did not stay true to the book. It ended very differently.",974332800,2,360,4.013888888888889
