5555086,5,B00B4HM4GG,I love Jennifer Lawrence and knowing she is in this tv show I had to get it. Now that it is no longer on tv and I wanted to watch them and I am very happy that I did buy this.,1372291200,,175,3.292682926829268
5555087,5,B00B4HM4GG,This sitcom is enjoyable to watch- I never even heard of it when it was on TV but it is funny and good entertainment!!,1372032000,,118,3.9583333333333335
5555088,5,B00B4HM4GG,"I can't believe this show was only on for three seasons, but I'm glad it was finally put on DVD.",1365206400,3,96,3.85
5555089,5,B00B4HM4GG,"I HAD NOT SEEN THE SHOW, BUT WAS ON JENNIFER LAWRENCE IMbD, (FILMOGRAPHY) SO OFF TO YOUTUBE , WHICH AFTER A SHORT TIME I ORDERED BOTH DVD'S AND REALLY ENJOYED. SHARING WITH FAMILY",1364947200,,179,4.454545454545454
5555090,5,B00B4HM4GG,"It's a shame I only discovered this show after it had gone off air but I've
now seen and enjoyed all of the episodes. This somewhat reminded me
of 'Home Improvement' in that the laughs were plentiful, family based
and never slapstick. Bill Engvall is a very funny man and the rest of the
cast are uniformly excellent. This is the kind of family I think everyone
would like to be part of - and legendary Brian Doyle Murray (as the old,
irascible neighbour) and Tim Meadows (as Bill's best friend Paul) only
add to the quality. Fans of goo family comedy won't be disappointed.",1364601600,6,574,4.476190476190476

5555093,5,B00B4HM4GG,"Another chance to see Jennifer Lawrence before she made it big.  She is a natural, beauty and actress..",1418860800,,103,4.722222222222222
5555094,4,B00B4HM4GG,"Despite the expected hit-and-miss humor endemic to sitcoms, there is something about this show that feels genuine, and it has its share of first class zingers, especially among the kids.  Plus, we get the chance to see Jennifer Lawrence develop as an actor.  She's a formidable presence even at that young age.  Engvall himself is actually the weakest of the actors, but a witty script saves his butt more often than not.",1402185600,,421,4.819444444444445
5555095,4,B00B4HM4GG,If you like comedy this is for you! Very enjoyable and relaxing to watch anytime! Bill Engvall and Nancy Travis are great!,1401148800,,122,4.590909090909091
5555096,2,B00B4HM4GG,"Very disappointed that the The Bill Engvall Show seasons 2 & 3 DVDs have no Closed Captioning available. Given my advanced stage of deafness I have to pretty much annoy everyone around me whenever I want to watch this series. For the price charged ($36.00) I expected to find the same features available in retail DVDs.

It was clear from the beginning that I was purchasing DVD-Rs, but there was no word about the (lack of) regular features.

Thumbs down, Amazon. And heads up, everyone.",1401148800,4,488,4.729411764705882

5555099,5,B00B4HM4GG,"I was skeptical about buying this DVD set considering all of the problems I have had with on demand DVDs playing on my PC or recorder but I love the show so I took a chance. When the set arrived I popped all the discs in to see if they would play and to my surprise they all did and perfectly too.

Since it is rare to find great on demand releases I won't be purchasing too many on demand DVDs in the future.",1389571200,3,409,3.869047619047619
