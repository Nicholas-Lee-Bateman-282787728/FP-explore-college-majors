Although this film seems like a piece of life, the writers try to connect these stories and don't seem to be very successful.  Whereas in a movie like Crash, all of the characters affect one another, even when it seems like they are just brushing by each other.  The story in this film seems a little too loosely connected.  I'll stop complaining there, because that was my only beef with this film.  The scenes are wonderfully done with superb acting, especially, again, by Robin Wright Penn and I like the closing scene with Glenn Close and Dakota Fanning.  This film is intriguing and insightful, but still left me wondering what exactly women think.  Very well done.",1139616000,3,771,4.795454545454546

2-1/2 stars [(2005)USA/Magnolia Pictures/Rated R] - (1 hr. 55 min.)

Written & directed by Rodrigo Garcia

Review:

CHICKFLICK ALERT!!! Sorry significant others but you're going to get dragged to this one whether you like it or not, so I've added a little checklist below to help you decide when to head to the popcorn stand, take a walk, check your messages, whatever.

Need I review this for the ladies? I think not. Here's an ensemble of some of our leading female character actors doing what they do best: making evident the frailty of human life and how extreme situations can be dealt with in dramatic, humorous, and sometimes melodramatic fashion. I wouldn't dare dissuade any person of the female persuasion from rushing out to enjoy the cathartic situations present in this nearly omnibus format (except that Rodrigo Garcia is the sole director who channels his feminine side with great aplomb).

Mr. Garcia also seems to be allergic to editing as he has shot each episode as one continuous 'steadicam' shot known as an 'all-in-one'. Budding filmmakers may get some added satisfaction working out how the camera and actors were choreographed to achieve this effect, but that's all of the technical satisfaction that will be gleaned from this experiment in delivering raw female emotions.

In any case, here's a little advice to 'da guyz' to make this experience feel less like penance and more akin to understanding the always enigmatic female mind.

9 short reviews as follows (w/ 'guy-breaks' indicated/story titles are mine):

I. PRISON (13 min.)

Characters/Cast

Sandra (inmate Mom) - Elpidia Carrillo

Ron (Prison Guard) - Miguel Sandoval

Mini-review: As 'Sandra', Mexican actress Elpidia Carrillo (""My Family, Mi Familia"") ably conveys the tragedy of toiling in a woman's prison, as well as the especially arduous task of repelling the advances of inmates and guards alike since her charge was for 'prostitution'. Sandra's meeting with her daughter turns into a heartrending (though slightly over-the-top) depiction of the explosion that results from the massive frustration that prison life can inspire. And it's definitely not pretty when it happens to a Latina who's drawn the straw that breaks the camel's back.

II. PREGNANT (13 min.)

Characters/Cast

Diana (Pregnant grocery shopper) - Robin Wright Penn

Damian (her old flame/grocery shopper) - Jason Isaacs

Mini-review: Being nearly full-term and having to do your own grocery shopping is bad enough, but what could be worse than to meet up with an old flame and have him profess his undying love to you (while he's married and you are too)! Robin Wright Penn (""White Oleander"") does a great job of conveying indecision and anguish at every conceivable level WITHOUT crashing her grocery cart to boot. One would wonder whether Jason Isaacs is playing the old flame or the devil himself as he tempts this fully impregnated woman to limits of her patience. Certainly one of the more entertaining episodes in this collection.

III. HOMECOMING (13 min.)

Characters/Cast

Holly (estranged daughter/See VIII.) - Lisa Gay Hamilton

Vanessa (her younger sister) - Sydney Tamiia Poitier

Ron ('Bad dad'/Prison Guard-See I.) - Miguel Sandoval

Mini-review: Okay guys, this is the one that you want to skip over and make that trip to refill the popcorn bucket, especially if you're a father with a guilty conscience. Lisa Gay Hamilton (""Beloved"") offers 'Holly' as a sweating, nervous, and overly neurotic daughter who wants to re-unite with her father after being estranged for many years. While the lovely younger sister 'Vanessa' (Sydney Tamiia Poitier) tries to comfort her it becomes clear that they are both hiding a deep dark family secret. And then Dad comes home ... SURPRISE!

IV. DINNER DATE (20 min.)

Characters/Cast

Sonia - Holly Hunter

Martin - Stephen Dillane

Lisa (wealthy lady) - Molly Parker

Damian (her husband/See II.) - Jason Isaacs

Mini-review: Okay guys, while you're getting the popcorn you might as well check your cellphone messages and use the bathroom too (this is your intermission). As expected, this is the 'my-husband-the-jerk' scenario that starts with the bad hubby forcing his wife onto an elevator (which she's afraid of) and then the evening goes downhill from there. To make matters worse, the always wonderful Holly Hunter (""Broadcast News"") is the poor suffering wife who constantly battles her incommunicative husband. Quote: ""I thought we weren't going to talk about this"" ... now do any of you guys really want to re-live that moment again?

V. DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY (12 min.)

Characters/Cast

Samantha - Amanda Seyfried

Ruth (her mother/See VII.) - Sissy Spacek

Larry (the disabled father) - Ian McShane

Mini-review: Well gentleman, you can return to your seats as the worst has passed and now you can sit back and relax while the disabled husband gets to show off his ability play the 'guilt game'. But hey, he's in a wheelchair so it doesn't apply to you right? Unless you're the type of guy who shouts out crossword clues and expects others to respond. Meanwhile the 'golden child' (Amanda Seyfried) spends her time at home to cater to poor crippled dad. Hey, at least pop isn't a child molester, right?

VI. FUNERAL (13 min.)

Characters/Cast

Lorna (unwanted mourner) - Amy Brenneman

Andrew (Deaf mourner) - William Fichtner

Mini-review: This next episode is possibly the most interesting (for guys anyway) because of its oddball mix of a deaf grieving husband and his 'ex-girlfriend' (Amy Brenneman) reuniting at the funeral of the man's recently deceased wife. Sure it's in poor taste, but it's the one episode where a 'male actor' gets a chance to steal the show even though he's just another horny b*stard (face it guys, we just can't keep it in our pants). William Fichtner (""The Longest Yard"") not only gets to propose sex, but since he's deaf he does it in sign language (and also in distorted 'deaf speak'). Guys will be laughing while the ladies jaws drop to the floor of the theater. Certainly worth the price of admission after all that's gone before.

VII. MOTEL RENDEZVOUS (13 min.)

Characters/Cast

Ruth (See V.) - Sissy Spacek

Henry - Aidan Quinn

Sandra (arrest for prostitution/See I.) - Elpidia Carrillo

Mini-review: Normally watching a married woman trysting with a younger man would be improper, but we've already met her disabled husband earlier which defuses the scandalous nature of the meeting. Still, the chemistry between Quinn and Spacek seemed forced to me but these two great talents are still watchable. Your mileage may vary on this one.

VIII. MASTECTOMY (10 min.)

Characters/Cast

Camilla (the nervous patient) - Kathy Baker

Richard (her husband) - Joe Mantegna

Alma (the doctor) - Mary Kay Place

Holly (the nurse/See III.) - Lisa Gay Hamilton

Mini-review: Okay guys, I know your feet must be getting itchy by now and this is your two-episode warning. It wouldn't kill you to watch this but who wants to see a pre-op wife berating her hubby for ten minutes. Plus this is your last chance to get a free soda refill for the road plus you can beat the line to the rest room. Best of all, if you come back too late you'll only be missing the final episode which is the least compelling of the nine.

IX. GRAVEYARD PICNIC (10 min.)

Characters/Cast

Maggie - Glenn Close

Maria - Dakota Fanning

Mini-review: Normally when creating a program of short episodes the director will save the best for last. Not so. Yes, Glenn Close (""Fatal Attraction"") is the best of her generation and Dakota Fanning (""War of the Worlds"") is the best of the pre-teen set, but great acting only emerges from great writing and this final episode is the most underwritten of the nine. I'm sure they put this episode at the end because a cat appears which provokes the line, ""do cats have nine lives?""

Oh brother, give me some explosions and a chase scene anyday, right fellas? Okay, she made you see this one so the next night you take her to a good bloodbath. All's fair in love and war right? As for you chickflickers, do your guys a favor and make this one a girl's night out, whaddaya-say???

2274576,4,B0009AFF6A,"The film, which is written and directed by Rodrigo Garcia (""Things You Can Tell By Looking At Her""), is a compilation of sympathetic vignettes centering on the lives of nine dissimilar women. Each abbreviated episode (10 to 12 minutes) has been staged as a continuous Steadicam shot and focuses in on one particular woman. Each woman's episode in the film is self-sustaining, although the occasional character can overlap into another woman's storyline - sometimes overlapping at the corners and sometimes as a more fully developed presence.

Sandra (Edpidia Carrillo) is a hard luck prison inmate at a woman's correctional facility awaiting a visit from her daughter. A very pregnant Diana (Robin Wright Penn) has a bittersweet and poignant chance encounter with an ex-lover, Damian (Jason Isaacs), while late night grocery shopping. Holly (Lisa Gay Hamilton) spirals out of control upon returning to her childhood home after a long absence. Lorna (Amy Brenneman) finds both a chilly and an unforeseen reception while attending the funeral of her ex-husband's (William Fichtner) second wife. Sonia (Holly Hunter) and her boyfriend, Martin (Stephen Dillane), have a bitter and inappropriate argument while visiting another couple in their new apartment. Ruth (Sissy Spacek) contemplates having an adulterous affair with Henry (Aidan Quinn). My favorite storyline is that of a hospital patient, Camilla (Kathy Baker), and her husband, Richard (Joe Mantegna). Awaiting a preoperative visit from her surgeon, Camilla is anxious and angry, lashing out at everyone, but especially Richard.  Poor Richard (who wants to be supportive and comfort his wife) cannot seem to say anything right.  It is only after receiving a sedative injection that Camilla finally becomes calm, allowing Richard to safely approach her, and permitting the audience to see the tenderness which is at the core of their relationship.

It is quite apparent that director Rodrigo Garcia genuinely likes women and accepts them despite their flaws and imperfections.  Each woman's storyline (with one exception) feels authentic, as if the audience had just intruded on a particular woman's life, leaving you to draw your own conclusions and fill in any back-story.",1131580800,23,2229,5.430635838150289

2274583,5,B0009AFF6A,"Nine Lives is a collection of related short stories wherein each is a snippet from a woman's life and each shot in one uninterrupted episode. Their themes include parent-child relationships, fractured love, adultery, illness, and death. It is a series of overlapping vignettes, each one running about the same length and told in a single, unbroken take, featuring an ensemble cast.

In these episodes, Holly has a brief moment of reverie while confronting the specters of her past in her old neighborhood. Maggie escorts her young daughter Maria to a cemetery as they visit the graves of their family members. Ruth is a married woman contemplating an affair while visiting Henry in his hotel room. Diana unexpectedly runs into an old boyfriend, Damian, while shopping for groceries. Camilla is a hospital patient awaiting surgery for cancer. Samantha is a teenage girl who helps look after her handicapped father Larry. Sandra is a female prison inmate who is expecting a visit from her children. Sonia lashes out at her boyfriend Martin when she finds out he's been cheating on her. And Lorna has an unexpectedly moving encounter with her ex-husband Andrew as she pays her respects to his second wife, who has just passed away.

The film is bolstered by a strong and talented cast ensemble and it features many insightful glimpses into the lives of women from different walks of life. The stories are sketches, often without resolution, and while individual segments succeed admirably, taken together the portraits are a fitful match. Also,it is a movie that demands concentration of the viewer to get the rewards the one is willing to pay attention.

If you want to see a good bird's eye view of this movie check out the review in this three star section that was written a few years back  by ""movie review guy"" .

 I was stunned by the need of the writer to have these characters throw out cuss words. It felt very forced. A couple of these tales are flat out stupid. I guess the writer thought that if he tossed in a bunch of cuss words and a sex scene he would be a shoo- in for the independent movie festivals or whatever.

The last story made the whole movie worth seeing.  In fact, if you borrow this DVD from the library , just forward to the last scene.",1380499200,,862,4.035294117647059

The Disney programme The Nine Lives of Elfego Baca was transformative for broadcast TV, and promoted the estimable Robert Loggia to stardom.  In a very grittier manner than Disney promoted Fess Parker to that actor's Davy Crockett stardom.  The Elfego Baca series, 10 episodes, could stand today on its own merits, while being superior in so many ways to today's trend to CGI made films.  Robert Loggia is an actor's actor.  I expect that Mr. Loggia might, through his representatives and his very many fans, apply to get his Elfego Baca set out on remastered DVDs.

Failing Elfego Baca DVDs, heck, grab Innocent Blood DVD.  La Femme Nikita meets Elfego Baca.  Helmed by John Landis.  Stellar cast in a film dripping irony.

2274592,4,B0009AFF6A,"Need the sins of the father be visited upon the son? Not if the terrific- nay, great, little 2005 film, Nine Lives, written and directed by Rodrigo Garcia, is Exhibit A. Garcia is the son of famed Nobel Prize winning magical realist fictionist Gabriel Garcia Marquez, of Love In A Time Of Cholera and One Hundred Years Of Solitude fame. Yet, despite that fame, the father's work, in novels and short fictions, is usually baroque and anomic in narrative, and hollow and superficial in characterization. In this film, his son, however, shows how quickly and deftly a whole life can be sketched and distilled- if not contained, in just ten to twelve real time minutes, doing something his father never did- create complex and compelling characters and situations. He has a human touch in his art that his father has always lacked with his magical realism.
  This hour and fifty-two minute film is, in short, antithetical to everything Garcia's father's art stands for. And, as a filmgoer, you should be very thankful for that! I'd never heard of this director, but heard good things about this film. However, I never take such recommendations too seriously, because for every great film like this I am told I need to see pretentious trash, like Crash, this past year's Oscar winner, an ensemble film that only wishes it could have a fraction of the hyper-realism this film does. Prior to this film, Garcia had directed commercials, some television episodes, including The Sopranos, and two prior low budget films- 2001's Ten Tiny Love Stories, and 2000's Things You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her.
  The film that this most reminded me of was Jill Sprecher's great 2001 film, 13 Conversations About One Thing, save that that film wove all its character's plights into a single loose thread, while this film is simply nine short films with a few crossover characters. Jim Jarmusch's recent compilation film of related short subjects, Coffee And Cigarettes, also mines this territory and style, but with nowhere near the success of Nine Lives. Of the nine segments, all named after the lead female character within, for Garcia seems to have a reputation as a woman's filmmaker, seven are brilliant or great, and the two weaker pieces are still good, solid films that experiment with the medium. However, any short story collection that was published, with seven of its nine tales being great would become a classic.... Other films, like Magnolia and Grand Canyon, try this overlapping technique, but they all tie things up at the end, often with all the characters meeting. These films are merely moments that will be big memories in the minds of each of the protagonists, in years to come. The backstories are implied so well, subtly and quickly, that it's not at all difficult to get into each scene within minutes of their starting. Yet, to know everything in those backstories would beg triteness and lengthen the film so that only two, perhaps three, of the stories, could still fit within.
  Garcia shows great command of his medium with his objective Chekhovian writing and zero endings, for what could have easily become a New Agey or Chick Flick piece of schlock. Unlike such films as Time Code, this experiment in filmic narrative works, and is a worthy descendant of the filmic experiments that Ingmar Bergman pioneered in the 1960s. It should have been one of the films nominated for an Oscar, along with other underappreciated films like The New World, Match Point, and Shopgirl. But, Hollywood keeps on churning out schlock like Brokeback Mountain and Crash instead, while films like this are shunted aside. Fight back, watch this film, talk about it with others, and make sure that the powerbrokers know that there is a market for such films. It's the only way there will be more of them.",1221436800,4,3799,4.8821705426356585
2274593,4,B0009AFF6A,"What a remarkable oversight we've got here!  Imagine if somebody walked up to you and said, ""Hey, I just saw this incredible movie!  It's about 9 different women, each with their own short story that lasts about 10 minutes.  Oh, and each story is told in a single camera shot.""

The premise alone was enough for me to check out NINE LIVES, a captivating collection of short dramas with an even more impressive cast.  But as neat a concept as this film is, I was instantly hooked from the opening footsteps and expressions of an incarcerated mother.  Think of a movie shot very similar to Hitchock's ROPE, except that instead of convenient reel changes after 10 minutes, writer-director Rodrigo Garcia utilitzes incredible techniques and transitions.  Garcia has worked on various HBO series, most notably IN TREATMENT.  In that show, Garcia again used a similar real-time format to shoot the 30-minute therapy sessions.  Like him or not, Garcia has mastered photography and pacing.

The casting is perfect.  Each story focuses on a woman struggling with various aspoects of her life.  They could be as simple as a mother and daughter having a picnic at a graveyard, or as complicated as woman attending the funeral with a former lover.  Then again, those examples are only simple at the outset.  You have no idea how each story is going to play out; they remain powerful even after repeat viewings.  My personal favorite (and probably most people's, too) is Diana's.

Robin Wright Penn and Jason Isaacs should've won Oscars for their uniterrupted, unedited work.  Diana is a pregnant mother just grocery shopping, when she unexpectedly encounters Damian, her former lover.  Watching these two actors convey their buried feelings is an absolute joy.  Anyone can perform a single emotion, but Isaacs and Wright Penn can deliver multiple subtleties that command encores.  This particular segment is some of the finest acting you'll ever see, and I encourage any drama professor to take a good look at it.

I think Diana's story is my favorite because I've experienced some of those conflicts, myself.  But the true genius of NINE LIVES is that it will reach audiences on various levels.  Any story compilation like this is going to by its very construction.  To me, it is both the greatest strength and weakness of Rodrigo Garcia's otherwise-perfect film.  Frankly, one or two stories just didn't do much for me.  I knew I was watching terrific performances and crafty camerawork, but I didn't know what to take from a couple of Garcia's tales.  It's frustrating to watch a 10-minute long scene, with no reprieve - if you're not hooked, you'll just have to wait until Garcia's gone onto the next chapter.

But my confusion could also be a strength to Rodrigo Garcia's genius.  Every one of the NINE LIVES is unique and compelling in their own way.  Each moviegoer will have his/her own way of relating to the diverse lot of protagonists.  Even if your experience isn't the same as mine, NINE LIVES will reach you in ways you've never imagined.",1215820800,3,3040,4.890410958904109

2274597,4,B0009AFF6A,"I love short stories. I read a lot of them and write a few as well. The beauty of a short story lies in its ability to connect with the reader in such a raw manner. There are hardly buildups or character definitions. The length of a short story does not allow this luxury. The author should be able to strike that chord with the reader in those brief pages. And there in lies, both the beauty and the challenge of a good short story.

You must be wondering why I am talking about short stories in a movie review. Well, this movie is just that. A collection of nine vignettes portraying women of different age, backgrounds and lifestyle. As the saying goes ""the apple does not fall far from the tree"". Rodrigo Garcia is the son of the legendary Colombia writer Gabriel Garcia Mrquez (Am a huge fan). Marquez is an absolute genius when it comes to the portrayal of human emotions. Rodrigo Garcia is just as accomplished. But film is his chosen medium of expression.

The movie boasts of an incredible cast of actors including Robin Wright-Penn, Holly Hunter, Glenn Close, Dakota Fanning and more. Each of them appear in a vignette which captures a slice of their life. In each of those short 10-15 minutes Rodrigo Garcia manages to say more than what most movies do in their entire length.

The 'nine lives' portrayed in it share a beautiful undertone of poignancy. It is that what makes us feel connected with each of these characters.

My favorite one among these was the one with Robin Wright-Penn. Ms Penn is one of those actresses who make acting seem so easy (She has one of the best smiles ever). There never a hint of strain or rehearsal.

The clip shows Ms Penn, a married and pregnant woman, running into her ex-lover at a grocery store (Reminded me of the Dan Fogelberg song ""Same Auld Lang Syne""). The subtle nature in which Ms Penn portrays a woman trying to hold back a flood of emotions and trying to act coy, is outstanding. She uses all her elements to convey the turmoil which the character is going through. Whether it is the quickly diverted glance or the measured sentences, it leaves us with a heavy heart.

Rest of the 'lives' range from a teenage girl who is the bridge between her at loggerheads parents, to the woman who is petrified of her operation. These vignettes (I love this word) capture the different shades of a woman in a manner which very few have.",1186790400,3,2383,4.50462962962963

Each story is short, to the point, and inconclusive.  They also all have an aura of sadness and loss.  Yes, the technical aspects of this film are good and the concept is interesting.  But, frankly, I don't like short stories.  Even in my reading experiences I usually go for a long, well developed work.  Some of the characters in one story do appear in a minor role in another.

You become the 'fly on the wall,' mesmerized by what you see and hear. The actors, production, writing and cinematography are superb. The simple but not-so-simple camera work add to the unique feel of the film. A must-see. I can't compare it to anything I've ever seen.",1173830400,,632,4.91588785046729

2274602,4,B0009AFF6A,"One often hears the term ""slice of life"" used to describe a movie. Well this film takes that life-slicing knife and cuts a little more finely, segmenting and serving up nine vital, loosely-connected snippets from nine different lives.  It's like a slower paced, less jarring and more contemplative version of Richard Linklater's ""Slacker"" - character- and idea-driven (almost to a fault) and unconcerned with the conventions of plot, traditional narrative or even recurring characters (although Nine Lives has a few, but you have to be alert to recognize and recall all of them).

If you feel, as I do, that movies too often tie up all the loose ends before the credits roll (which really hardly ever happens in life), then this here is the film for you!  Each snippet is unapologetically unresolved, and I give the filmmakers enormous credit for not giving in to the tried (trite) and true Hollywood formula of gift-wrapped resolutions.  The acting is almost uniformly outstanding, and the choreography of the camerawork is breathtaking to behold.

The only aspect of the film that I found lacking was the writing - although poetic and profound in places, sometimes it's also bludgeoning you over the head with what I call ""the anvil of exposition"", as several lines speak a little too obviously and ham-handedly in trying to bang home the central theme of the movie.  ""We are linked to everything and everyone on this little planet,"" one character says, and I have to fight the urge to shout back at the screen that old Creative Writing 101 chestnut: ""Show - don't tell!""

Aside from that, don't be surprised if you find yourself not completely resonating with one or two of these vignettes (and I would imagine which ones in particular would vary from viewer to viewer), but ultimately this film hits a lot more than it misses.  And even if only seven of these snippets connect with you (as was the case with me), that's still seven out of nine, which in my math-challenged world equals four stars.

And speaking of math... though Amazon lists the running time for this film as 82 minutes, it's actually 112 minutes.  The DVD also features an excellent 73 min Q&A at the Strasberg Theater and Film Institute (which is quite an appropriate setting, seeing how this movie has such a combination of both stage and screen elements) feautring Rodrigo Garcia, Amy Brenneman, Lisa Gay Hamilton, Kathy Baker, and Joe Mantegna.  It's kind of like a low-budget (but rich in substance) version of ""Inside the Actor's Studio.""  Don't miss Joe Mantegna's story near the end about the ""perfume error"" - it's very funny.

The DVD also contains 4 Featurettes: ""The Women of Nine Lives"" is a series of very short interviews (7 minutes in all) with writer/director Rodrigo Garcia and six of the actresses describing their roles.  ""Sonia: Blocking A Scene"" is an interesting split-screen presentation following (on the left side of the screen) the DP and director walking their way through and figuring out how to shoot a tough exterior-to-interior scene while the actual finished scene itself plays on the right.

""Working With One Continuous Take"" and ""Maggie: A Day at the Cemetery"" are my favorite of the featurettes, exploring more fully the technical aspects of shooting these challenging scenes.  It's amusing to see the small army of crew members shadowing Glenn Close and Dakota Fanning in the cemetery as they try not to fall victim to its treacherous footing.  It's no wonder they had to get a second steadycam operator for the shoot, seeing as the camera itself weighs 85 pounds and they would do more than ten complete motion-filled takes over the course of five or so hours on any given day of shooting.  Hats off (and much respect) to the tech crew!",1172793600,2,3748,4.875590551181102
2274603,3,B0009AFF6A,"I was eager to like this experimental film written and directed by Rodrigo Garcia (son of the Colombian novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez), but in the end was disappointed. Garcia tells the stories of nine women, each one as a separate and independent 10-12 minute snap shot. Except for pain and dysfunctions of all sorts that relate directly to the men in their lives, the nine stories are unrelated. We encounter teenage and elderly women, blue collar and professionals, black, Hispanic and white. Diana is divorced from her husband but they should have stayed together. Sonia is badly married and should divorce. Holly confronts her abusive step-father and maybe commits suicide. Samantha referees between her distant parents. Ruth considers an affair, Camillie confronts breast cancer surgery, and as an inmate Sandra is separated from her daughter. The artistic signature of this film is that Garcia shoots each of the nine vignettes in a single, uninterrupted 10-12 minute shot with a hand-held camera, and that the crises these women face remain unresolved.",1169596800,3,1062,5.252941176470588

2274605,3,B0009AFF6A,"Rodrigo Garcia`s ""Nine Lives"" raises the question of just how emotionally invested a viewer can become in a character who appears on screen for no more than ten or a dozen minutes throughout the course of a movie.  And what happens if ALL the main characters show up for that little a time?  For this is the case with ""Nine Lives,"" a compilation of vignettes about nine virtually unconnected ladies, each of whom is struggling with issues common to women in a modern world.  Some are coping with messy relationships, others with regrets about past actions, still others with health issues and the looming possibility of death.  Even though the stories abut slightly on one another from time to time, each exists essentially as a stand-alone sketch able to function without the others.

The main problem with a movie like ""Nine Lives"" is that, for all the insights it offers into life and human relationships (and they are many), it simply can't develop its characters to any appreciable extent in the time it has allotted them.  Just as we are becoming engaged by a particular woman and her situation, the movie shuts us down by cutting away to the next segment.  This is really no criticism of the movie per se - which is a well written, well acted and well directed piece of lyrical filmmaking - but the structure dilutes our interest and robs the film of the cumulative force it might have had were the individual stories fleshed out to feature length.

Still, given the limitations, this is a film filled with flavorful moments and fine performances from a large and gifted cast that includes Sissy Spacek, Mary Kay Place, Glenn Close, Dakota Fanning, Holly Hunter, Lisa Gay Hamilton, Robin Wright Penn, Joe Mantegna and Aiden Quinn, among many others.  And the final moments are so tender, poignant and touching that they carry the film to a level where it transcends artifice and makes a genuine human connection with its audience.  Thus, despite the reservations one might have about the film as a whole, the parts are more than compelling enough to make it well worth watching.",1166400000,2,2085,4.782729805013927
2274606,4,B0009AFF6A,"""Nine Lives"" is made up of nine vignettes, each about ten to fifteen minutes long, each detailing a different woman confronting a unique situation.  A few stories have a very clear intent and pack a wallop; a few are basically character studies that encourage you to take from them what you will; and a few are artsy head-scratchers.  With the exception of one vignette set in a women's prison, all of the stories feature mundane settings and, at least initially, mundane situations.  But then something stirs up the status quo.  The beauty of the movie is, even when you dislike a particular story, it's over long before you completely lose your patience.

I liked the way the featured woman in one vignette sometimes appeared in a small role in another woman's story, or that we'd first see a woman in a smaller role in one story and then later in a featured role in a later piece.  The male characters appearing throughout are also quite interesting, although a recurring theme seems to be how men complicate and limit the lives of the women in their sphere.

The acting in the film is a particular stand out, naturalistic yet gripping.  It was nice to see several big-star types ditch their usual Hollywood showpiece roles to play these subtle, multi-layered characters that have some complication to them.  Which isn't to say that their performances aren't dramatic and attention-grabbing, because they often are (I'm especially thinking of the poor woman in the supermarket who is waylaid by an old love in the produce aisle).

Generous extras further illuminate the intentions of the movie's vignettes. Especially interesting are interviews with the actresses, who give insight into how they approached the task of bringing their characters to life.",1164844800,,1756,4.962457337883959
2274607,2,B0009AFF6A,"Nine Lives is one confusing film because it's good but it's not good at the same time. The film reminded me most of Crash because it tells stories of multiple characters but it's different because they don't ever pass each other or live in the same neighborhood. Because this DVD has Sundance and other film festivals written all over it you say hey this has to be an amazing movie, if they liked it I should love it but that is not the case. In fact I have come to believe that I can only trust Sundance sometimes because they're not always right. The movie revolves around Nine Women that basically have nine different problems. Although it starts out good it doesn't end so great and I mean it doesn't end at all. The problem with Nine Lives and I mean this is a huge major problem is that the film ends and you still know nothing.

It tells half of a story for each character and then it moves on to the next one. So you never know what happens to any of these deep stories that you were getting very interested in. Forget learning morals and more about feelings, I just want to know what happens to these people. So I even look on the DVD features for some extra stuff to find explanations and all I see is a small roaring crowd praising these actresses and directors as if they accomplished a great film. Then I go to review sites and see words like amazing and breathtaking, are you serious? Nobody is curious or mad that they don't show what the end of these stories and people are actually satisfied with this movie. I'm not going to lie, the acting was very good and I'm not mad at the actresses but since when does a movie that is half done acceptable unless it has a sequel. Good acting and the direction this film was going in was nice but it took a wrong turn to a road it will never get off of.",1161043200,3,1809,4.228323699421965

If she had been pregnant and 25, okay, I could believe the pining or attraction to the old lover she runs into.  At 40?  No way!  Personally, I know that by 40, if you're any kind of healthy, you must have gotten over crap from 10 years before, or, here we go - a depressing situation.  We spent half the movie arguing about which sex had written this depressing, poorly scripted piece of crap that gave no messages other than this:  with a high-profile cast, you can sell anything!  I figured it must be a man who wrote it, because who else would make women such victims!  My husband said, unequivocably, that a woman wrote it, because there is a disabled man in every vignette.  After about 7 vignettes, my husband was snoring away and I am sitting here warning anyone I can to only rent this movie if they specifically want to be sick to their stomachs or bored out of their minds watching celebrity talent flailing and gasping to death on this horrifyingly trite?  stupid? adolescent?  stupid did I say? confusing movie.  Luckily, I rented it from the library so I only wasted my date-night - still too high a price to pay.  I thought I was going to get an under-appreciated-but excellent indie gem, but I'm sitting here writing this review, fighting off the depression inspired by this crappy movie.

2274609,4,B0009AFF6A,"`Glimpse of life' may be an overused phrase, but `Nine Lives' is exactly the kind of film of which content fit these words most comfortably. The difference is that the film deals mainly with the lives of women, and that all nine segments are shot in one continuous shot.

Rodrigo Garcia made a debut film with a similar material in 2000. That was `Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her' in which five episodes are loosely connected to one another. In `Nine Live' as the title suggests, he decided to make more ambitious film where we are shown one brief moment of women, which reflects the past of their lives.

These nine women are: Sandra (Elpidia Carrillo); Diana (Robin Wright Penn); Holly (Lisa Gay Hamilton); Sonia (Holly Hunter); Samantha (Amanda Seyfried); Lorna (Amy Brenneman); Ruth (Sissy Spacek)); Camille (Kathy Baker); and Maggie (Glenn Close).

The supporting characters are played by Stephen Dillane, Dakota Fanning, William Fichtner, Jason Issaca, Joe Mantegna, Ian McShane, Molly Parker, Mary Kay Place, Aidan Quinn, and Miguel Sandoval. Some of them appear in more than one episodes (for example, Jason Issacs can be seen in the second and fourth episodes as the same role), and in this way the film displays how all these `lives' are connected to each other, making the whole universe.

I should not write down the summaries of all episodes. I only write about my favorite one. In the second episode, you see a pregnant woman pushing a cart in a shopping mall. The ordinary scene of daily life changes to something different when she notices that the man shopping in the next aisle is her old friend she hasn't seen for a long time. In the next 10 minutes you will learn much more about them and their relations, and the scene is very real, and the ending very poignant. I also like the last episode about Glenn Close and Dakota Fanning, of which conclusion (with a twist) is sweet and bitter at the same time.

Not all episodes are successful, I am afraid. Some stretch the theme too much, and some are, I thought, a bit pointless. All episodes are bolstered by strong acting from males and females alike, but it is only natural that female characters play more substantial and memorable roles in every episode.

Each episode is well-acted and beautifully shot, but my only complaint is the technical aspect. As I said, all the shots are taken in one long uninterrupted take. That means the camera follows the characters on and on, but I frankly don't see the point of doing this. It is challenging not only for the crew and cast, but for us viewers, who need some patience to follow the camera. And I may be wrong, but to shoot dialogues in this way often slower the tempo, making the entire scene a little dull. (Kathy Baker's episode is one example.) Traditional montage method might have been more effective for some of the episodes.

That said, `Nine Lives' is a very insightful and realistic look on the life of ordinary people, great improvement on `Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her.' It is like reading a collection of short stories. (Well, but no wonder for the director is the son of Gabriel Garca Mrquez.)",1157500800,,3152,4.699275362318841
2274610,4,B0009AFF6A,"""Nine Lives"" is a series of episodes in the lives of nine women. For the most part, they are quite ordinary people living ordinary lives, and the events the scripwriter chooses are rather ordinary events. But each vignette grips the viewer with the tension and drama of the moment. A woman meets a former lover in a supermarket, another is preparing for a mastectomy, another's marriage breaks into full and awful view in the home of friends. The episodes are very lightly connected--a woman going to a funeral appears later on as an anesthesiologist at a hospital, another who painfully prepares to confront her father appears later as a very mild-mannered nurse, while the father (I think) is a prison guard who appears in the first scene. Each scene takes place in one room or place, and each has the quality of a real life video--almost as if someone turned on the camera for 15 minutes and just let it run. I kept waiting for the punch line but there wasn't one, and for that I give it a 4. Maybe it's just that each life has within it drama and tragedy on a huge scale. It's the kind of movie a woman understands, but not so interesting for a guy--I predicted my husband would hate it and I was right. But give it a try.",1156723200,,1226,4.429203539823009

2274612,5,B0009AFF6A,"'Nine Lives' is the cleverest at presenting the interlocking story design popular in 2005 without seeming contrived. ('Crash' is a better movie, but 'Nine Lives' is the best at assembling the interweaving plots. 'Syriana' is more loosely put together, but wins for being realistic.) As has been perennially told, 'Nine Lives' contains several short films that are related by threads in plot and relationships to show key scenes of angst in women's lives. For me the favorite scene is when a hispanic woman distinguishes herself as a goody-goody inmate and must face mental cruelty by a male guard. Other poignant moments come when two former lovers run into each other at a grocery store and realize that fate had separated them only to find them again married with children to another. Another woman needs the comfort from her husband as she faces a mastectomy operation. The cleverest scenario is when a woman must face the family of her ex-husband who committed suicide. As she seems to get the blame, she finds herself in a sticky situation.

The movie's revelations provide for satisfying ""ah-ha"" moments. It comes together beautifully with little tragedies that are filled with heart-breaking revelations. The acting is admirable with well-known stars altruistically taking on supporting roles (Glen Close, Mary Kay Place, Joe Montegna, and Sissy Spacek). While other lesser known actors do a maverick job at the helm, including Miguel Sandoval, Lisa Gay Hamilton, and Dakota Fanning. Rodrigo Garcia does a great job capturing all the tension.

2274618,5,B0009AFF6A,"I've seen a lot of movies that came out in 2005 and had never heard of this movie until it ended up on Roger Ebert's Top 10 List. I don't listen to every decision a critic makes or anything, but when it makes a Top 10 List I find it intriguing. This movie uses a formula that's been used in movies before and was even used in the 2005 Best Picture winner ""Crash"". But in the past, films like this one, shows segments of different people with different lives who's stories end up intertwining in the final moments of the film. ""Nine Lives"" is different. Instead we have 9 segments of uninterrupted shots of 9 women that aren't meant to come together at the end and aren't meant to really tell a story. I think that they're memories that each woman will remember for the rest of their lives. So, when you're watching this movie; when the segments over don't expect a resolution at the end. You won't get it. But, out of 65 movies I saw that were released in 2005; I don't think any movie effected me as much as this did. It's not the best film of the year, but it's better than a few of the films that ended up in that category during Oscar time. The fact is, some independent movies deserve Academy Awards and nominations but don't get them. This film definitley had the potential to get something from the Academy, but it was just to independent and to obscure. The movie's also to low-key, which is a problem. In 1998 a very small independent film called ""Boys Don't Cry"" won Hilary Swank the Oscar for Best Actress, but if not for that performance it wouldn't have even been noticed. But, I've rattled on to much about other things. I can't sum up the way this film affects a person or how brilliant and moving it is with merely a synopsis. I don't want to give to much away either, so here is the bare plot of each segment.

Sandra-Is a woman who is desparate to speak to her daughter from behind the prison walls that she rests in.

Diana-Is a pregnant woman who runs into an ex-lover in a grocery store. This love they share for each other has obviously has a tremendous impact on their lives.

Holly-Finally confronts her step-father after years of abuse. A powerful segment, that leaves you with a bucket of questions.

Sonia-Is a woman, who's boyfriend discloses a very personal moment in her life to some friends.

Samantha-Acts as a middle man between her bickering parents.

Lorna-Is a woman who show's up at the funeral for her ex-husbands wife.

Ruth-is a woman who struggles with the question of whether she should have an affair.

Camille-Is a woman entering surgery and dealing with the stress.

Maggie-Is a woman having a picnic with her daughter at a gravesite. This segment only becomes more powerful when it's over.

All the actresses in the lead: Elpidia Carillo (Sandra), Diana (Robin Wright Penn), Holly (Sidney Tamiia Poitier), Sonia (Holly Hunter), Samantha (Amanda Seyfried), Lorna (Amy Brenneman), Ruth (Sissy Spacek), Camille (Kathy Baker), and Maggie (Glenn Glose) are amazing in this movie. Writer/director Rodrigo Garcia makes sure that every segment counts and each one tells a story that matters. A few of the segments are powerful and affecting right from the begining, while others you have to wait. This review isn't that well written, but I'm trying to get one major point across. I think everyone needs to see this movie and hopefully I've gained enough interest from you to do so. I can not stress enough how much I want people to see this.

For me, it was a huge waste of time. The ""stories"" are snippets of a seemingly larger whole that are not explained; the audience is left to their imagination.

Also, only two of the stories carry over in the film while the others leave you bewildered. The story featuring Holly Hunter was especially pointless; I've seen better marital feuds on sitcoms.

Most annoying is the writing: it is mediocre, at best; the dialogue was almost boring, even if it was well-delivered. Finally, the stories are all depressing, most of the characters are crying and bereft, and you're left feeling very dissastified because they end abruptly.

I was very moved by the stories and very impressed by the acting.  I wasn't a fan of Robin Wright Penn before seeing this, but I sure am now.  She was amazing.  I read some reviews of it before I saw it in the theater and some of them said they didn't like the structure, or the way the stories ""drop in"" on the characters and then just stop rather abruptly, but it worked for me.  I have seen the movie 3 times so far and I still keep hoping some of the stories will continue so I can find out what happens (especially the one with Amy Brenneman and William Fichtner).  I think some people would be bored by this film and others, like me, enthralled.  I dragged my husband to it when it played in the theater and he wasn't as interested in it as I was.  But I would say, give it a chance and let it grow on you.  For me, the impact of it didn't hit until it was over and I kept going over it in my mind on the way home.  I was also interested in the way the movie was shot - each story in one take - which must have been fun for the actors since many of them are also stage actors and shooting a film this way would be more like doing a play on film.  Anyway...I give the movie 5 stars for the 6 stories I felt were the best part of it.  And if I could give the actors stars I would give them hundreds.  They are all wonderful, and it's great to see them be able to do great work (especially those who usually play little throwaway parts in big movies), even in a movie that will probably not be seen by a lot of people.  Also kudos to writer/director Rodrigo Garcia, a great talent who deserves a bigger audience and more/better publicity for his work.",1142812800,,1966,3.907035175879397
2274621,4,B0009AFF6A,"It appears that everyone in each of these nine episodes is in a prison of sorts.  For some it is overt, like a real prison or a debilitating illness, and for others it is caused by something in their past, like an abusive father or the untimely death of someone close.

The question in my mind is whether the film is trying to expand from these nine stories to the stories within all of us.  Are each of us in our own prison, perhaps of our own making.

Some of these stories were difficult to watch . . actually most of them were.  And none of them had a conclusion, except, perhaps, for the scene in the graveyard.  But all of them ended on a down note, and is that too a metaphor for the difficulty in just trying to make one's own way in the world . . that it is impossible, and that there may be very little, if anything, in life worth living for or to sustain us.

Not an uplifting expeierience, but a rather haunting one.",1142640000,,928,4.122222222222222
2274622,5,B0009AFF6A,"Nine slice-of-life vignettes shot in real time, with top-notch actors and dialogue, in all-too-real and stunningly unvarnished situations/emotions/moments.  Yes it's centered around 9 women who are (very) loosely connected, but this is not the kind of glib sentimental schmaltz of a bad chick-flick, it really grabs you and does not let go.  Most refreshingly of all, there is no neat little sermon or cliche-fest at the end to tie everything together...it's left as open-ended, unknowable and ungraspable as it should be, because that's just how life is, get over it already!

I immediately went back and watched several of the vignettes again after my first viewing...that's how much depth and power this film has.  Definitely worth owning.

Have to agree with one of the other reviewers, this is the kind of film-making that restores one's faith in the medium after one too many Hollywood crapfests like ""War of the Worlds.""",1142467200,2,927,5.153333333333333
2274623,5,B0009AFF6A,"What a great, stunning, emotional movie! These nine vignettes, each about 12 minutes long, feature very different women from all walks of life, each of them who could be said is stuck in some kind of emotional rut - some more deep than others, some of which they have control of and some they don't. We start out with Sandra in LA County Jail who is trying her best but whose emotions are right at the surface and a seemingly minor incident spells disaster for her. Then Diana played exquisitely by the fabulous Robin Wright Penn who runs into her old love, Damian, in the supermarket years after their relationship has ended; the one gesture by Damian just broke my heart. Other standouts include Sissy Spacek as the wife of a disabled man (Deadwood's Ian McShane) who shows up in two of the vignettes and Amy Brenneman as he ex-wife of a man whose wife has just committed suicide. All the stories are so vivid, so intense that I am glad I saw it on DVD instead of in a theater as I found I was forced to take a break in the middle. There were several that moved me to tears. This is really great film making and absolutely highly recommended.",1142208000,8,1144,4.400943396226415
2274624,5,B0009AFF6A,"This was an amazing film that really let each actor mold their characters perfectly and did not distract from the story with music or trivialities. The scene with Kathy Baker was my favorite although Jason Isaacs and Robin Wright Penn were brilliant.

Highly, highly recommended for people of every taste.",1141862400,2,305,5.1
2274625,5,B0009AFF6A,"What this film IS: A thoughtful exploration of individual moments in the lives of many different women, all of them facing some crisis or difficulty. It is also the closest thing to a short story collection I've seen on film - if the short stories cut straight to the climax of each story (read on, you'll understand what I mean).

  What this film is NOT: A suspense or escape thriller with all the answers handed to the viewer at the conclusion. This isn't a ""feel good"" flick, although there are parts which are touching and warm. It is intense and if you don't pay attention, you'll miss subtle but crucial moments.

  I was stuck by the amazing complexity in the lives of each of these women (and their men as well) and by the rather audacious decison by the director to leave lots of questions unanswered, allowing the viewer to imagine what happens next to each character, to fill in the spaces...or just to keep wondering about the whys and wherefores.

 You see each women at a major moment in her life but you don't really know the entire backstory, nor do you know what will happen next. A pregnant woman meets her old boyfriend in a grocery store and the moment sets off a shockwave of emotion. Another woman confronts her stepfather, gun in hand, but...why? Was there sexual abuse? Or something else that has left her so angry, unhinged and desperate? A young girl seems to be managing to keep peace in her home, to look after her disabled father and to keep her parents together - or is she? Sometimes one woman will show up in another woman's episode, so that there is some overlap and you get a chance to see another side of a person's character.

  If you don't like loose ends, I'd suggest you stay away from this film. But I loved it, love the acknowledgment that sometimes there are crucial moments that may be AS important - or MORE important- than the moments that came before or since. Pivotal moments. And does it really matter what happens next? To see more might actually make the crucial moment less intense, less meaningful.

  An extremely creative, daring, magical film!

IF YOU GET THE DVD: There are some very nice special features in the DVD, including interviews with the actresses who give THEIR interpretation of the characters they play. This led to some new insights as I listened to them speak about what they thought of their characters and what motivated them. There are other ""behind the scenes"" moments which show how certain parts of the film were set up and shot.",1141171200,23,2508,4.591928251121076
2274626,4,B0009AFF6A,"Columbian director and writer Rodrigo Garc&iacute;a (Things you can tell just by looking at her, multiple episodes of Six Feet Under, Carnivale, The Sopranos, Fathers and Sons, etc) does what few writer/directors are capable of: Garc&iacute;a observes the human condition, finds the stories that such observations suggests, fleshes out these ideas into vignettes, and then weaves them into a tapestry of a film that is simply breathtaking.

NINE LIVES is simply the reporting of nine women and their surrounding characters who are coping with an emotional crisis involving relationships with a parent, child, lover, husband, or sister and the manner in which each woman deals with keeping her life intact despite the trials of everyday living. Imagine walking down a street, as a flaneur, observing glimpses of a person and conversation that lasts only as long as the time you approach, pause and pass on by and you have an idea of the technique Garc&iacute;a uses. These little short stories are the stuff of life we all encounter: Garc&iacute;a pauses long enough to let them make an impact.

Part of the beauty of this film is the sterling cast which includes some of our finest actors - Kathy Baker, Amy Brenneman, K Callan, Glenn Close, Stephen Dillane, Dakota Fanning, Holly Hunter, Jason Isaacs, Joe Mantegna, Ian McShane, Mary Kay Place, Aidan Quinn, Sissy Spacek, Robin Wright Penn - the list goes on. There is a sense of ensemble commitment to this film despite that only occasionally do the characters overlap. The writing is terse, understated, always saying just enough to arrest our attention before moving on, much the way life keeps passing. A very fine work, and one that reminds us that great movies from quiet stories come. Grady Harp, February 06",1140998400,2,1766,5.044520547945205
