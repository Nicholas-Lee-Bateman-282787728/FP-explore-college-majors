5186380,1,B008VV4YUW,"I just finished watching Amazing Spider-Man and decided to watch a bit of kung-fu from my recently purchased copy of Wu-Tang Iron Fist Collection. I load the disc numerous times for it only to read as, 'NO DISC'. I will be returning the disc to Amazon ASAP.",1352505600,4,257,4.48936170212766
5186381,1,B008VV4YUW,"Yeah , it's loaded with kung fu goodness , just be prepared to see artifacting so bad that your eyes will bleed . First off , the Blu Ray disc is 50gb . Average movie has been compressed to 1.6gb , the ones that I scanned were 480i . They'd look bad on a 2"" screen let alone a big screen TV . Arguably worth the money if you're a kung fu fan and can't afford the superior quality DVDs or VHS tapes for that matter . My expectations going into this pre-order were pretty low and boy was I let down .",1352332800,30,498,3.8446601941747574
5186382,3,B008VV4YUW,"WU TANG IRON FIST COLLECTION BLU-RAY

Release Date 11/6/2012 / Golden Star Films

Advertised as a collection of 25 films on one Blu-ray disc, this is actually a 23 feature film collection with two lengthy extras. As you might expect, the image quality is of the lossy MPEG-2 variety (think YouTube with loads of artifacting evident,) however, the majority of the films are presented in a sort of cropped widescreen that does present more than what you normally see in pan and scan. Sound quality is generally good, all but one of the features are dubbed (see notation.) Recommended as a good starter package for viewers interested in Hong Kong and Taiwanese action cinema.

5186391,5,B008VV4YUW,I don't know if all the people who gave this 1 star are new to the genre but this blu-ray set the picture quality ranges from  good to great. If you watched these movies back in the day on VHS you know about bad quality. For this price it is a must buy for Kung Fu fans. Are the movies remastered no but I didn't expect them to be and they are all enjoyable. A must buy!,1398297600,10,370,3.8051948051948052

5186393,5,B008VV4YUW,"I hesitated purchasing this dvd after reading posted reviews.  I don't know whether they received a horrible copy, but I did not.  I love this collection.  Only one movie is subtitled, and the rest are in English.  I liked all the movies very much, and only a few are in another collection that I have so that is a big plus.  I would recommend this dvd.",1393891200,8,353,4.287878787878788
5186394,4,B008VV4YUW,"This anthology of movies does not live up to the expectation by way of picture quality associated with blu-ray discs, nor does the sound system inspire awe but you are likely to find at least forty percent of the movies enjoyable and three of which can be considered some of the best martial arts movie you will ever find; namely Incredible Shaolin Thunderkick, Death Duel of Kung Fu, Eagle Claw, and Hot, Cool and Vicious which will confound you with unparalleled martial arts choreography particularly during the last ten to fifteen minutes.",1388361600,5,543,4.913043478260869
5186395,2,B008VV4YUW,"I'm someone who buys about every bargain movie set from Mill Creek, Echo Bridge, ect. I was expecting at least something comparable to a mill creek set, but these movies are so compressed it's ridiculous, not only can you not clearly watch the ""fast flying kung fu action"", you can't even read the subtitles much of the time because the films are so heavily compressed, it's truly well below VHS in quality, it's really to bad too, looks like a great list of old school flix, but I won't be watching them in this pitiful quadruple compressed VCD quality.",1386979200,7,554,4.606060606060606
5186396,4,B008VV4YUW,"Yo my Blu-ray Disc came in the mail and I'm very pleased, didn't know a bunch of these actors are Shaw Brothers actors but these aren't Shaw movies....great for my collection at this cheap price.....I think if your a fan you have to have this one...25 movies for under $15 grab it whole you can......GentlemenFoxx...I'm out this peace....I'll Holla",1385942400,,348,4.915254237288136
5186397,5,B008VV4YUW,"For these old movies its not bad and they are watchable
and I enjoy these movies we will just have to wait on some better technology to make more prettier and clearer old movies , but I think if they had the tec it would have been done cause everyone wants to have the best product to sell .I give a 5 star the fact that i can still watch these old kong fu its better than nothing thanks wu tang .",1384819200,,397,3.8536585365853657

5186399,4,B008VV4YUW,"All of the flicks are filled with hokey goodness that comes stock on most 70s KF flicks.  Video quality could have been much betteer with today's technology.  Editing is horrible, but that is expected of the genre that started pushing out 10K+ flicks in a manner of a decade.",1373673600,,275,4.591836734693878
5186400,5,B008VV4YUW,"Before I bought this, I read reviews saying that it was terrible quality, but I decided to buy it anyway. This is an awesome collection, and I see no quality issues myself, but maybe that's just me. I've had this collection for a while now, and I'm glad I went against those reviews and bought this, it was worth it.",1369267200,13,316,4.283333333333333
5186401,1,B008VV4YUW,"This was obviously made by some 12 year old on a computer with a bunch of VHS-ripped kung-fu movies that he acquired off of Limewire like 8 years ago. No, but seriously this is horrible it's not worth $2 let alone whatever they are currently charging for it. I was hoping that this would be at-least decent with a few OK looking films but they are all garbage, this shouldn't be on a blu-ray disc. The company who released this should be ashamed of themselves but whatever, they got suckers like me buying garbage in good faith. Please stay far away.",1367366400,29,550,4.455445544554456
5186402,1,B008VV4YUW,I bought this blu-ray knowing that the movies therein were not true blu-ray films but thinking that maybe they were at least slightly clearer than their DVD counterparts. NOT. These films were WORSE than any of the prints I've seen for them. They used VERY HEAVY compression (I guess to fit all the movies ON a single disc). The result is that the films on here look worse that the old VHS copies I have of them. Don't waste your money.,1366416000,21,436,4.395061728395062
8531241,3,B008VV4YUW,"For the most part this 25 martial arts movie collection was a real treat but the first two movies were a bit tedious with one, which was actually a trailer, was completely silent and the next movie was in Chinese or Japanese or some language like that had subtitles but that is kinda tedious to read unless you constantly watch the movies which I don't always do. But the plot was a man rapes a rich man's wife then fights the rich man's thugs to keep from getting killed, not my kinda movie! I found the "" hero "" too disgusting in this movie. A rich privileged young man rapes the daughter of another rich privileged man...no don't really care! I just feel sorry for the girl. The other movies i have to admit made me turn around and watch the rest of the movies. But about half way through, for some reason they started showing some rappers talking about their favorite martial arts movies...WHAT A BORE! Then it picked up with the rest of the movies. Looked like a lot of them were set in modern day (70's-80's) but with pretty good storylines. I prefer movies that are set in Imperial periods or for Japanese moves, during Imperial and Shogunate periods. But, if you are a fan of martial arts movies, this is a good set to start with anyway",1496966400,,1244,4.3896103896103895
