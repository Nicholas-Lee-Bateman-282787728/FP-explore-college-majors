5851644,2,B00DRQETJM,"The films, while rare on dvd at an affordable price, are poor quality.  Films are out of focus and blurry in places.  Unless you just want to watch these films to remind you of just how funny Jim Varney was and how much he is missed, avoid this three pack of Varney films and try to locate them individually on dvd.  This is not a good choice to complete a Varney film collection.  Keep looking for these individually to get a good reproduction.",1418428800,,445,4.325301204819277

5851660,5,B00DRQETJM,"Very funny movies that don't require you to pay attention to every little detail in order to enjoy them!  We like to watch these movies as a change from 'serious' movies, which might even be comedies, that are listed as 'classic' or 'drama' though they may just be 'artsy-fartsy'.  Yes, there is a bit of 'bathroom humor', and/or some 'slime' or practical jokes being acted-out but these movies allow you to relax, enjoy yourself, and not have to WORK at it... A great value and a good time had by all. :-)",1453420800,4,506,4.489130434782608

8596840,4,B00DRQETJM,"Great bargain, three movies for the price of one on DVD. A couple things to be aware of: NONE of the movies are presented in widescreen aspect ratio, despite the label on the back of the package claiming ""1.78:1 Anamorphic Widescreen.""

Ernest Goes to School is an un-matted 1.33:1 format, undoubtedly how it was filmed. Ernest in the Army and Ernest Goes to Africa (which were probably also filmed un-matted 1.33:1), however, are slightly matted and presented in a weird stretched ratio somewhere between 1.66:1 and 1.78:1. Notice I say ""stretched,"" which is not what anyone wants when watching a movie. And no, it was not my TV settings, the ""stretch"" is actually baked-in to the encode on these two films.

All three movies were filmed with a 1.85:1 matte IN MIND for any potential theatrical release, so as such all three movies are 1.85:1 (or 1.78:1) ""safe"". What this means is that you can use the built-in functions of your 16:9 TV to Zoom & matte the flims to appear in proper 1.78:1 widescreen on your TV. It's easiest with Ernest Goes to School, since this film doesn't suffer from the baked-in stretch, just Zoom in and matte an equal portion of the top & bottom of the picture. That's what the 1.85:1 ""safe"" means-- you aren't losing any vital information in the portion of the image that you matte out.

For ..Africa and ...Army it's a little tougher, since you have to de-stretch the image before applying the Zoom & matte. I'm not sure if all TVs have this ability. Luckily, mine does, so I was able to restore the image to roughly 4:3 and then Zoom & matte.

As for the encode qualities themselves, ..School seems a little duller color-wise than the other two, and also suffers from low resolution/macro blocking. This is more evident if watching in 1.78:1 mode. Still better than VHS quality, and probably the best way this movie is going to look for the forseeable future. I have not seen any of the other releases of ..School on DVD, but considering they are all in multi-packs like this, and also from Image Entertainment, I'm willing to bet they're all the same transfer.

..Africa and ..Army seem to share a lot of qualities, from the baked-in stretch to the more vibrant colors and a seemingly higher resolution (I guess due to the stretching?). Unlike ..School, however, both the other films are also available on standalone-DVD releases. While this is not a review for those releases, I feel I need to at least compare the technical specs between them: the standalone releases are in ""proper"" 4:3 un-matted format, without stretching.  You'd think they'd also carry a higher bitrate, not having to share the disc with other films, and would look a lot better. You'd be wrong.

Actually, the standalone release of ...Army (Lions Gate Entertainment) has a fatal (in my opinion) flaw in the mastering of the disc that really ruins the viewing experience. About halfway into the film, every other frame starts being displayed in B&W. If you frame-step through the film you get COLORFRAME-B/WFRAME-COLORFRAME-B/WFRAME, etc, for the rest of the film. What this looks like in motion is like a ""flicker"" effect and dulls the colors since you're only seeing the colors half the time. The colors on both standalone releases are also a lot duller already than on this 3-in-1 package. The frame issue basically makes the standalone release of ..Army unwatchable.

The standalone release of ..Africa (First Look Studios/Ventura) does not sport any such flaws, and seems to be a pretty solid release. Back to back comparison with the 3-in-1 transfer reveal the only differences to be baked-in stretching and more vibrant colors on the 3-in-1. When I watch ..Africa, I stick with my standalone release, just because it doesn't have the baked-in image stretch. While my TV can reverse the effect, it just seems a better all-around experience, maybe due to higher bitrate. Although, if I didn't already own the standalone release of ..Africa, I'd be just fine with adjusting and watching the 3-in-1 transfer.

All films sport a Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo soundtrack.

As for the films themselves, Ernest Goes to School and Ernest Goes to Africa are two of the better films in the series and two of my personal favorite. Ernest in the Army, I never got into as much, although that could be due to years and years with that horrible Lions Gate disc with the mastering flaw.

At the end of the day, this package is a great bargain. I knocked a star off for the baked-in stretch on two of the flims, and for falsely claiming the transfers are 1.78:1 encodes. Sure, you can watch these in 1.78:1 from this disc, you just have to do some tweaking to your TV settings. For someone who doesn't have any of these movies already, I can't think of a better way to pick them all up.",1475539200,,4776,4.742168674698795
