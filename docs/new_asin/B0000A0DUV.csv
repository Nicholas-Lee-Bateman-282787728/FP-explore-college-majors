Special footnote, actor John Wayne once said, ""Every country in the world loved the folklore of the West - the music, the dress, the excitement, everything that was associated with the opening of a new territory. It took everybody out of their own little world - The cowboy lasted a hundred years, created more songs and prose and poetry than any other folk figure - The closest thing was the Japanese samurai. Now, I wonder who'll continue it...His performance as Ethan Edwards in ""The Searchers"" (1956) is ranked #23 on Premiere Magazine's 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time...Of his many film roles, his personal favorite was that of Ethan Edwards from The Searchers (1956). Wayne even went so far as to name his son Ethan after that character...The inscription on the Congressional Gold Medal awarded to him in 1979 reads, simply, ""John Wayne, American.""...After meeting the late Superman star Christopher Reeve at the 1979 Academy Awards, Wayne turned to Cary Grant and said ""This is our new man. He's taking over.""...Turned down the role of Marshal Dillon on ""Gunsmoke"" (1955) because he did not want to commit to a weekly TV series. He recommended his friend James Arness for the role, and gave the on camera introduction in the pilot episode...I would like to be remembered, well...the Mexicans have a phrase, 'Feo fuerte y formal'. Which means; he was ugly, strong and had dignity.""
