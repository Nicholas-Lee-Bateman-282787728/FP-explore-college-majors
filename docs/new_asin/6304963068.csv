943962,3,6304963068,"This movie is kind of a snoozer.  However, it does feature an appearance by the Three Stooges.  This is just a short time before Curly suffered his career ending stroke so he wasn't as sharp as normal.  The Stooges help to vitalize the film.  The acting in this movie is not the best.  As you could tell by the title the movie features a lot of swing...and if you like swing then by all means go out and get this.  But as an overall movie it was below par.  It's nice to see the Stooges in a feature, with a fairly prominent role.  Too bad it was at the end of Curly's career.",1067126400,,576,4.035398230088496

943964,4,6304963068,"The plotless B musical is amusing, however the main reason to get this is  to see jazz singer Connee Boswell sing, since there isn't much video  footage of her performing elsewhere, this is as close as it's going to get  to seeing her live.",968976000,4,240,4.409090909090909
943965,4,6304963068,"Low-budget Monogram Pictures usually made a couple of higher-bracket ""specials"" every year with the studio's leading star, Gale Storm. This is Monogram's biggie for '46, with Storm as an aspiring singer mistaken for a process server at Phil Regan's new nightclub. The Stooges are in fine form, with the reliable Ed Brophy as their foil in extended versions of their ""plumbers"" and ""waiters"" routines. (Moe didn't dye his hair for this one, so you'll notice the salt-and-pepper in the haircut.) Considering that Curly was in failing health at the time, his work here is especially good. The other guest artists are Louis Jordan and his Tympany Five, who do two jump numbers (""Don't Worry 'Bout that  Mule"" is the standout), singer Connee Boswell, and sound-effects mimic Windy Cook. This picture is almost never shown on television, so most Stooge fans probably haven't seen it. It's an above-average Monogram production, and fans of '40s movies should enjoy it. There are at least two video versions: the Allied Artists edition uses a beautiful print but an inferior video transfer so the image is sometimes unsteady; the Goodtimes version (under the title ""Swing Parade"") has a slightly lesser print but a much better transfer.",944438400,,1228,5.109452736318408
943966,2,6304963068,"This was a boring film, but there was one scene in it at the end of the movie that made sitting through it worth while. Some actor (don't know who) rivals Jim Carrey with his imitation of different sounds.",933292800,2,205,4.282051282051282

The 3 Stooges have supporting comedic roles as waiters. It's obvious here that Curly was in failing health.

Highlights of this so-so musical are Louis Jordan and his Tympany Five's performance of their jump hits, ""Caldonia"" and ""Don't Worry About the Mule."" Former Boswell Sister Connee gives a powerful rendition of ""Stormy Weather"" and Gale Storm dances and sings ""Oh Brother."" She also does ""On the Sunny Side of the Street."" Phil Regan is heard and Will Osborne's band has a couple of numbers, as well. Windy Cook does vocal impressions of everything from a soda bottle to a saw.

SYNOPSIS--
To get his son to enter the family business, wealthy Daniel Warren Sr. sends Carol Lawrence with papers that will close Danny's nightclub. When Carol auditions and is hired as a singer the document never gets delivered. Then the father himself arrives to finish off Jr.'s nearly bankrupt club.

7880097,2,6304963068,"""Swing Parade of 1946"" is a low-budget Monogram hodgepodge with some intriguing talent on display. Behind the cameras are cult filmmaker Phil Karlson and writer-director Nicholas Ray (credited with ""additional dialogue""). In front of the cameras are Louis Jordan, Connee Boswell, Gale Storm and comic relief from the Three Stooges (their last feature with Curly Howard). Standout numbers include Jordan's ""Caldonia"" and Boswell's ""Stormy Weather."" The Stooges help enliven the dead spots. Hardly classic cinema, but a curio nonetheless.",1318464000,,536,5.7974683544303796
7880098,3,6304963068,"The Swing Parade of 1946 promises and delivers some great vintage musical numbers and, as advertised, is a Super Production, from the Poverty Row Studio that produced it.
It is especially delightful to see Gale Storm in her pre-television career as a musical performer.  She was a very talented and likeable lady who did more motion picture work than
later generations realize.  If you like 40's Swing Era music you'll be pleased by the way so much of it was worked into Monogram's Super Musical, an ambitious production for a
much larger studio.  But while Swing Parade is outstanding for its time and the resources ladled into it, the DVD video reproduction is B+ at best.  Probably the distributors didn't
have good original material to work with and I doubt if the smaller studios of the era had the resources to properly preserve their film originals.  The DVD suffers from a lack of
good mastering and the released video appears like something from low definition television.  This would be a beautiful film if it could be seen in its original glory, reproduced from a sharper original master film print.  Still, Swing Parade of 1946 is a fun feature to watch if one enjoys the music of the Swing Era and the big musical production numbers.
I recommend this video, with some reservations, for the enjoyment which the DVD has to offer.",1314230400,,1340,4.774891774891775
7880099,1,6304963068,"Most of you out there might not know that this film was released on video way way back in 1977, under Allied Artists video (Cabaret was also released then.) which went out of business promptly.  THIS WAS THE VIDEO TAPE THEY USED FOR THIS RELEASE.  The funny thing is, that the transfer I made ( I happen to have the original video tape - in Beta, which was a better format picture quality-wise) looks better- which is sad.  I fully expected (at least) a new transfer if not in 35mm (which, I'm sure is quite unobtainable- might not even exist any more in 35mm anyway) but an old 1977 video tape???? I have to quetion this.  5 had to give at least 1 star for people who might say ""well, it's better than nothing.""  Precisely.  The film itself is a cute fluff with several good musical numbers.  Highlight being Connee Boswell singing STORMY WEATHER.",1140652800,5,848,4.467532467532467
7880100,3,6304963068,"This is an excellent movie with the Three Stooges in major supporting roles. This was Curly's last feature. The only problem, at least on my copy, is the picture quality. It is only marginally better than the budget version on Goodtimes. The sound is much better here, however. Also, there are no menus, extras, or special features of any kind. The DVD simply plays from beginning to end like a VHS. The Stooges are their typical corny selves, but the scene near the end with the kid auditioning for a job at the nightclub (no Stooges) is worth the price alone!!!!",1134518400,,564,4.594059405940594
7880101,2,6304963068,"The enduring popularity of The Three Stooges is directly attributable to the 190 comedy shorts the team made for Columbia Pictures (1934-1959), particularly the 97 entries featuring Curly Howard as the third Stooge. While several of these classic comedies are available on DVD, a few non-Columbia Stooge curios have turned up, including this title.

SWING PARADE OF 1946 is a low-budget musical produced by the lowly Monogram Pictures, starring Gale Storm and Phil Regan, with Moe, Larry and Curly providing comedy relief. Away from their home studio, the boys seem to be a little disoriented; worse yet, Curly is clearly in declining health (later that year he suffered a stroke that forced him to drop out of the act). Rabid Stooge fans may want to check this one out, although it's nowhere near the level of their best work. Casual viewers in search of the usual boisterous antics are advised to look elsewhere.",1132358400,3,914,4.973856209150327

A beautiful girl, struggling to pay the rent, stumbles into a 1940s nightclub singing position, after a botching a summons delivery. the musical sequences don't stop, they are amazing ""caldonia!, caldonia! what makes your big head so hot! now my momma use to say..."" they play with neon instruments. the dance numbers are so energetic, awesome fred-estare-esque tap, with a bounce, up and down the stairs. Not like the struggling aerobic dance you see now a days. The girls are actually beatiful,(...) not dying of starvation, and not hopelessely depressed with black eye shadow, beautiful!!!! I'm an artist and if this hasn't been colorized already I'd jump at the chance to do it myself, it would be hours of fun. and the three stooges pop in and out with some suprisingly good writing.",1081728000,2,877,4.89261744966443
