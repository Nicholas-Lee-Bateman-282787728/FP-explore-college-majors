If you must loop a video for hours, this is the video to use. It is not only applicable in the baby's room (At low volume), but also a place of business when stress must be minimized. It best to have at least three copies handy when one has to give a gift and one is not prepared to do so since it appeals to all people regardless of age group, fraternity, or organizational affiliation. Highly recommended!",1414022400,,553,4.276190476190476
8674299,5,B00MREMR8U,"Watching this beautiful, peaceful, naturistic video, several things came to my mind.  I noticed that there are so many different insects, not just bees, that actually feed from flowers.  These creatures vary in colors, shapes and mobility.  The photographer gave me a close look at them and I noticed features that I would not see normally.  The colors of the different flowers were so vivid and the flowing water in the stream made a beautiful scene for those of us who like to meditate and get into the silence.  I would recommend this video to folks who love and appreciate nature.",1410566400,,584,4.742574257425742
