7923609,2,B00004U3UH,"Released as a promotional tool for Snoop's new rap group, this movie is actually just a home movie with a bunch of Snoop's friends playing parts. Fans of the West Coast rap scene will notice not just Snoop but such greats as Warren G, RBX, Jayo Felony, and Xzibt, just to name a few.
The movie can be of the ""so bad, it's good"" variety at times. The dialouge is just awful as Snoop plays a kingpin set up for the murder of a Jamacian drug posse. Big Tray Deee is the new crime boss who set up old Snoop. Now, Big Snoop and his comedy sidekick have to break out of prison and go to war.
The acting, fight sequences, and overall pace is just laughable.
Half of the movie was filmed in Snoop's house as you can clearly see all of his old posters and plaques on the wall. The film was recorded on a digital camera and follows the same boring and predictable concepts that often come with many rapper movies where the lead character is an invincble and invunerable super-gangster who never gets beat up or made a fool. He even goes pound for pound with Tray, who is clearly a lot bigger than he is.
If you're looking for some good fun and want to see what kind of movie Snoop and his pals can make with a video camera, check this out but it makes previous album-inspired movies, MURDER WAS THE CASE and THE GAME OF LIFE look like cinematic classics in comparison.",1059350400,3,1358,4.2471042471042475
