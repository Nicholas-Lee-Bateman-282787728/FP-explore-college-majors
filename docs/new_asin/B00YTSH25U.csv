7269042,5,B00YTSH25U,i can't wait to watch Sisters again....sooo happy to see it's coming out on DVD :)  Now hopefully the whole series will be available eventually :),1435622400,11,146,4.615384615384615
7269043,5,B00YTSH25U,"Yes Shout is releasing the first two seasons of this great, very complete series, but, they appear to have no release schedule set for the remaining seasons of the series. Without knowing whether I will be able to acquire the series complete, I plan to wait before ordering, this first release.",1435622400,4,294,4.784313725490196
7269044,5,B00YTSH25U,"Looking foward to revisting my traditional Saturday nights in the 90's - hope the other seasons come out as well. A quality TV show (rare) which portrays family dynamics in a realistic, positive way; sibling rivarly, aging parents, maturing children and inevitable change.",1435449600,12,272,5.348837209302325
7269045,5,B00YTSH25U,Finally!! Amazing series! My mom and I used to love this series. I used to tape reruns on lifetime but it hasn't been on in years.,1434240000,13,130,4.038461538461538
7269046,5,B00YTSH25U,"This is one of my favorite series of all-time. It is a thoughtful and well-written family drama following the ever-changing relationships and love lives of four sisters, all of whom have names that are traditionally male because their late father always wanted boys.  Alex is the oldest sister, and is the rich one of the four; Georgie is the homemaker with two boys and a seemingly perfect marriage, Teddy is the recovering alcoholic, single mother and Frankie the working women of the four.  These sisters may fight at times, but ultimately are always there for each other through all the struggles of life, be it the death of a loved one, sick children, pregnancy, cancer, failing marriages...

One unique aspect of this show was the use of younger actors playing the teenage versions of the four sisters, as each of the four sisters would reflect on their past and sometimes interact with their younger selves.  The writing on this show as top-notch and though it could get kind of zany at times, was always emotionally relevant.  The acting from the sisters was good as well, all held their own, but Sela Ward as Teddy and Swoosie Kurtz and Alex were two stand-outs.",1434067200,30,1171,4.7772277227722775
7269047,5,B00YTSH25U,"Yippee!!!  I know this isn't an appropriate ""review"" but I was overjoyed to learn that the 1st two seasons will be released later this year.  I will definitely edit this as a proper review once I've had a chance to relive the show!",1433462400,17,231,4.348837209302325
7269054,4,B00YTSH25U,"4 starts for the show, 3 for video quality (and no cc btw).  Im somewhat new to the show, I didn't watch it much first run on tv but ordered it on the actress' and description now.  Im ambivalent about the story, I love the drama and actress' but the quirky silly fantasy (and singing hubby) parts are sorta a turn off at times (or a fast fwd of remote).  That said I keep watching and can see myself ordering seas 3 as the reviews state the show changes somewhat to more drama.  Just be aware the drama of say Sela in Once and again is not the same its mixed w/ sill fantasy, but it is good enough to attract you to the story and continue, unless you hate sill fantasy scenes then don't do it.
The picture quality is fine, but I did have to adjust settings to fine tune it on both my tv and dvd player menu.
Same for sound.  I had no problem after that.  But if you really notice details or have a huge tv you may have a problem w/ quality.",1495929600,,941,3.978723404255319

I could deal with the poor picture quality if I could hear the dialogue! Very affordable price but would have rather paid more for a quality product.",1482883200,4,291,4.576923076923077
7269062,2,B00YTSH25U,Glad to have this on dvd finally.  Cant give it 5 stars though.  The quality is less than desirable for the price ypu pay.  This item should be $10.00 and because of this its kind of a rip off.  Hopefully the other seasons are better quality.  Remaster these episodes please.,1478649600,,275,4.42

7269095,5,B00YTSH25U,Five stars for the show - 1 star for the studio that reproduced it on these discs. The quality is amateurish at best- with outdoor scenes so dark you can barely see people. If you can live with the low quality - its worth it. What a sad way to pay tribute to such a great show. Youtube videos look better.,1465171200,3,305,4.016393442622951

7269097,5,B00YTSH25U,"I've been waiting a long time for this series to come out on DVD. I would periodically check Amazon to see if someone had picked it up for DVD release. When I saw that Shout Factory had released it, I was excited and ordered these right away. I remember watching this show with my mother when it first started. Every Saturday Night we would watch the lineup starting with Golden Girls until that ended and continued with NBC's three hour block of programming. It was our Saturday Night routine and I was truly sad when this show ended. As I watched the DVD's, it's amazing how all of it came flooding back - some of the dialogue that I remembered, the storylines, etc. The quality is not as terrible as some of the previous reviews have made it out to be. Yes, it's grainy, but this show aired 1991-1996. We are lucky to even have the series released on DVD. I purchased Seasons 1-4 and have pre-ordered Season 5. Hopefully, I won't have to wait long for the final Season to be released.",1463616000,4,987,4.398907103825136

7269105,5,B00YTSH25U,"Loved this series when I discovered it at first as re-runs on Lifetime and I'm glad to say it's held up in quality all this time later. The fashion and cultural references are a bit dated of course, but the story is still engaging and the performances are wonderful. Loved them all and they work so well together, although Swoozy Kurtz's Alex was a bit unbearably snobbish at turns, along with her cross-dressing surgeon husband Wade. Another thing I didn't really care for were the openings in the steam room. I always got impatient during these sequences for some reason-glad they did away with that as the series progressed. Apart from that, great series and great first 2 seasons. I like the two seasons in one set as well",1457913600,,726,4.635658914728682

7269122,5,B00YTSH25U,"I have waited almost 20 years for this show to come out on DVD. And it was worth the wait! Even though I taped every single episode from its beginning (I still have the VHS tapes), I totally agree with a reviewer that the show is as ""relevant"" today as it was then. Sisters was, and is, the best drama about women ever written for TV. The writing, the story lines, and the outstanding performances by the characters can never be matched today. It was an era when women's shows were few and far between. Cagney and Lacey made their mark on TV drama first, and I loved that show as well even though the genre was different. But Sisters set the standard for future shows, with strong women characters as the leads. Teddy, Georgie, Alex, and Frankie became my ""sisters"" The brilliant acting of Sela Ward, Patricia Kalember, Swoozie Kurtz, and Julianne Phillips will never be forgotten. Also, hats off to Heather McAdams, a fabulous actress. Brava to Jill Novick (playing a younger Teddy) and Riff Regan, (playing a younger Georgie), both of whom added to the uniqueness, narrative, and perspective of this show that transcended even my own expectations. If I could have given 10 stars to this show, I would. I watched the first and second Seasons as soon as it arrived, and I look forward to Season 3 and beyond. From the first scene of the first episode, I returned home to a familiar and loving family, and rekindled my friendship with the Sisters.",1450051200,14,1446,4.608527131782946

7269125,5,B00YTSH25U,"I thought I would never see this series on dvd! I was so happy when I checked a few weeks ago to see that season 1&2 were released and season 3 slated for January. What a great show. This show was never boring. I thought I had remembered the series plots but actually there was a lot I had forgotten, so it was great to see it again.

7269130,5,B00YTSH25U,"The show itself is every bit as good as I remember it to be.  Yes, it would have been nice if the picture quality was better.  I don't understand why the picture quality is only so-so, when shows that are older (like Andy Griffith and Mary Tyler Moore) have a picture quality that is much better. Also, I like closed captioning and was surprised to discover that this is not available on this set.  Please add this feature to the next set for those who need it!  Finally, the bonus features were not that great.  Although it was interesting listening to Lipman and Cowan (the creators of the show) talk for a few minutes, it would have been fantastic to hear from the actors on the show as well. But, I didn't buy the show for the bonus features. When all is said and done, I bought the dvd for the wonderful stories and warmhearted feeling I get when I watch the show.  Mission accomplished. Now, how do we bring Brooklyn Bridge and Nothing Sacred to dvd????",1447200000,4,959,4.389830508474576

7269146,5,B00YTSH25U,"Like everyone, I've been waiting ages for Sisters to finally be available on DVD, and I'm so glad it finally is! I think most people looking to buy this show are already fans, but in case you haven't seen it and are wondering whether to watch, the answer is probably yes! The series follows four sisters who at first glance fall under four archetypes--Mrs. Perfect, the caretaker, the rebel, and the over-achiever--but you will quickly realize these characters are not flat stereotypes-- they are well written, well-developed, complex women that feel incredibly real and unique. The supporting characters are also individuals in their own right, and clearly not just there for the main four to bounce dialog off of. The story lines have a familiar, down-to-earth feel without being boring or overdone. It's also worth noting that the show's creators both had a background in theater, and so there is a touch of whimsy and theatricality thrown in to add a bit of surprise in each episode without being distracting or overbearing.

Some of the reviewers mentioned the poor quality of the DVDs.  I don't think they are anything worse than would be expected for a series from the early 90s. I had no issues being able to see the picture, and while the sound was a little low at my normal tv volume, it was totally audible once I turned the tv up. The menus aren't anything fancy, but they are easy to navigate and offer the option to ""Play All"" or play one episode at a time. Finally, there are some nice interviews with the creators/long-time show-runners Ron Cowen and Daniel Lipman, that offer some insight into some of the behind-the-scenes decision making.

I binged through these two seasons in about 4 days, and really hope this isn't the last we've seen of Sisters!",1443744000,5,1769,4.7745098039215685

7269150,5,B00YTSH25U,"There have been some complaints about the picture quality, which I found fine. I LOVED this series and am halfway through with this set. I pray they release the rest of the series. This show got better as the seasons went on.",1443312000,3,225,4.380952380952381

7269153,5,B00YTSH25U,"I have read a few comments about quality and such. I did not find the quality poor and I am able to hear everything just fine. I have waited years for this series to come out on DVD. If you are an avid sisters fan like I am, you are going to love this DVD set. I am trying to pace myself; having only watched about 7 episodes since it arrived in the mail. I am falling in love with the sisters and their families all over again. One of the most surprising aspects is that the show is still just as relevant today as it was all those years ago. Struggles with marriage, children, sickness, job security, and the like are confronted much the same way that the Reed sisters confronted them over 20 years ago. Ignore all the nay-sayers and order your copy today; I am glad that I did.",1443052800,13,780,4.1381578947368425
7269154,1,B00YTSH25U,The low rating is for the very poor quality of the DVD. The audio is very indistinct and as captions were not included the show is almost unwatchable.,1442707200,9,150,4.392857142857143
7269155,3,B00YTSH25U,"I am writing this on behalf of my wife since she never would say anything bad about this show.  She has been waiting for it for years to be released on DVD, and even though I don't care for the show I was happy to see it released so she could finally watch the DVDs.  I won't speak to the quality of the show because I know it is popular, but the quality of the DVDs is very poor.  The picture is grainy and dark and at some points unwatchable.  It's like watching through dirty glasses on an old TV with part of the picture tube blown out.  You'd think that they could remaster the recordings or clean up and enhance the video.  If they can do it to shows from the 60's (Like Star Trek) why is the quality of the picture so poor on this show?  It definitely wasn't rushed to DVD...so lazy I'd assume.
I give it 3 stars because my wife is enjoying the show...but no more than that because the quality of the DVD is so poor.",1442620800,33,923,4.038461538461538
