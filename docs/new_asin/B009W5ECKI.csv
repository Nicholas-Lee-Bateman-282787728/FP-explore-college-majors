John Borgstedt's story, though so very painful to read, is a chronicle of his spirit of triumph against all odds. His story documents such painful suffering that is nearly incomprehensible to many, yet so prevalent in our society.

John was a victim of his environment, and he looked to his guardians to keep him safe. Unfortunately, he found neither the love nor protection he needed, and thereby suffered repeated abuse and abandonment. It breaks my heart that he never knew the security a child can feel in his mother's arms. That was withheld from him with malicious intent.

I have heard John speak, and I cried as he bravely stood before us recalling his suffering at the hands of adults. Society let him fall through the cracks, but he survived by the grace of God. I have cried again reading his story and watching his movie/documentary.

John's story gives us an inside view into the cycle of child abuse, and he shows us what could have been done to save him and children like him, and what we can do now. As adults, it is our duty to be aware our society's children and step in to help when we see that they are in danger.

John Borgstedt is a conqueror. He is a big man with a big voice and big message, and serves a BIG GOD who has called him to a great mission. John has overcome the challenges in his life, and is on a full-forward mission to help others. Nothing will stand against him and the God's call on his life.

Contact John Borgstedt and join him making a difference for the sake of our children",1352678400,,1773,4.423312883435583

8544642,5,B009W5ECKI,"A great but sad DVD of what this little boy went through. Watching the DVD you can put a face with the little boy and see what he is doing today. I thank God for people like John that can come forward and tell his story so he can help out children and adults. Its not a pitty story it about helping other children and adults alike.

After being forced to live through the horrific childhood abuse that he had to endure,to being the child advocate that he is today, truly makes him a very special person.  This DVD is a must watch and a great training tool for all child advocate organizations.
