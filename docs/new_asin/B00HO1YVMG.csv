8633999,3,B00HO1YVMG,I received in great time. However. I thought I was getting a CD that I could play at the pool to help me keep time. I wish it would have been a CD not a DVD ... one where she tells you when to change positions. I love working out in the water so much easier for my back issues. I have had Back Surgery and I have a Stem put in now to help me walk.  I will keep searching..  :(,1433808000,,376,3.573170731707317
8634000,5,B00HO1YVMG,"Love this program. Sue is a lot of fun and the exercises are challenging but not hard to learn. I've been using it exclusively for only a few weeks as part of an illness recovery program and find I am feeling much stronger and my balance has improved remarkably.
I have a couple of suggestions: first, it would be really helpful to have a waterproof card illustrating the moves to take poolside as an easy, quick reminder and two, the format of the video is much too repetitive. Sue keeps introducing herself, which gets a little old. I've been taking my portable DVD to the pool deck and playing it to learn the exercises (hey, I'm an old gal and my memory isn't what it was) and I wish she would just get on with it so I don't have to fast forward so often. It's a great video,though--the exercises are effective and Sue is entertaining. I've tried several Poolates programs and I do believe these exercises are the best.",1409702400,,923,4.435294117647059
8634001,3,B00HO1YVMG,"Although Sue has some great ballet and tango moves, I was expecting a complete water workout.  In this video, she shows you the steps and then tells you to do each one for a minute each, three times.  I don't know about you, but I don't usually wear a watch with a second hand in the pool.  I have been desperately seeking a new (athletic) water workout video (I already have all of Karen Westfall's videos) and was disappointed to find this one not exactly what I was looking for.",1405641600,3,481,4.322222222222222
8634002,5,B00HO1YVMG,"I have been using these videos for almost a year.  I had a shoulder surgery about 18 months ago and am not able to do weight training like I had in the past.  My Physical Therapist suggested I try water workouts.  She explained that the water allows the body to work out without the stress on the joints and it provides a greater resistance.  I started using Sues' videos and I no longer have a sore shoulder after I work out.  I have seen better results in all over body tone than with traditional weight training.  Not to mention water gives a great cardio work out too.

Sues' video combos are simple to apply and remember so that you don't need the video playing while you are doing the workout.  The ease of use allows me to use the workouts in pools wherever I travel.",1390694400,5,774,4.289655172413793
8634003,5,B00HO1YVMG,"I LOVE THESE VIDEOS!!! Sue is hilarious and incorporates a fun, high energy approach to exercises that simultaneously use multiple muscles and joints to improve muscular endurance, strength, coordination, balance, posture and agility. My body has completely transformed in ways I didn't think possible, not to mention the workouts are so much fun that the time flies by! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE VIDEO'S...you won't regret it!!!",1388966400,5,428,5.5
