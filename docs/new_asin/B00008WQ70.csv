7987633,4,B00008WQ70,"Radhe (Salman Khan) is a kind-hearted young man, but he turns to violence to solve most problems.  He falls in love with Nirjara (Bhoomika Chawla), the gentle and innocent daughter of a Brahman priest.  She despises Radhe's violence, and rudely rejects him.  Radhe begins to become unhinged as a result.  Eventually, Nirjara returns his love, but a tragedy strikes, changing everything.

Tere Naam seems at first to be just another romance, but it becomes a serious drama that left me emotionally raw and empty.  Khan is fantastic in his role, expertly playing a range of emotions.  He was thoroughly convincing throughout the movie, in all the phases of his character's mental state.  Chawla, as well as the supporting cast, also gave strong performances.  The song-and-dance numbers didn't fully fit the film, but the incidental/atmospheric music was excellent.

Overall, with the exception of one scene that didn't flow with the rest of the movie, Tere Naam is an amazing and unsettling emotional experience.",1493424000,,1011,5.185185185185185

7987637,4,B00008WQ70,"This has got to be the most brilliant and angst filled loved story that I have seen in a Hindi Movie. Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam pales in comparison to the level of angst and sadness found in Tere Naam. I've read the other reviews and after watching the movie myself realized that the depth of divine symbolism embedded in Tere Naam is immense and if you miss the symbols - then the movie does not connect well.  Tere Name is the kind of movie that you have to bring what you see and are told along with you through the movie.
Salman Khan as Radhe is some of the finest acting I've seen from Mr. Khan to date ! I don't know where he went emotionally to do this film, but it is evident throughout the movie that he pull from an internal resource.  I could give the synopsis of the movie, but it can be read here or on Wikipedia. I will say that paying attention the Peacock feathers early in the movie will add to a greater understanding to the last scene of the movie - I believe the character to be Radhe (fast forwarded in time.)

Overall, the music is good the costumes appropriate for the time period. What I didn't like ( at first ) was the hair on Salman Khan.  I thought, this has to be the worst hair weave since Veer - and even that had some of his hair - but the more I watched the movie I understood the necessity for unconventionalism of his hair and behavior. The first part of the movie moves along quickly and perhaps is characteristic of the Hindi - boy meets girl- Salman style - it's the last half of the movie that will make you emotionally raw at the end. There was a character of a deaf -mute girl that I would have liked to have seen developed a bit more but, if you are a Salman Khan fan, then Tere Naam is a must see. If you are not, it's still a must see. The acting is superb, the script highly intelligent ( knowledge of Brahminism and Ashrams is helpful), and the emotional content high. Tere Naam is entertaining, but not fun for the whole family - there is no happy ending.",1359244800,,1999,4.144329896907217
7987638,5,B00008WQ70,"This is one of the best Hindi films that I have seen over the last few years. The soundtrack is quite good; especially Tumse Milna, Tere Naam, Kyon Kisi Ko. They are beautifully presented in the movie and fit in very well with the plot. Salman Khan gives one of the best performances of his career. His portrayal of an unusual main character was highly convincing. Radhe is an unconventional main character, very rough around the edges, tough on the outside, and takes some time to warm up to. Yet despite his shortcomings, Radhe was also able to recognize and appreciate the pure goodness within the character Nirjara played by Bhumika Chawla. She does fine in her part as an innocent,  pious, religious college student.  There is nothing inappropriate in the film, it is focuses on middle class Indians, and Salman delivers an excellent, haunting performance. This love story is not conventional at all and this is one the main reasons it definitely a movie worth watching. The second disc includes clips of some of Salman's most memorable movie scenes and popular song videos. Highly recommended.",1295568000,5,1099,4.903225806451613
7987639,1,B00008WQ70,"....And that's saying something.  Usually I enjoy Indian cinema.  They aren't the greatest movies on the planet, and as a westerner, you have to put yourself in a certain mindset when you watch them.  But most of the time, they are enjoyable diversions with photogenic actors and wonderful scenery.

""Tere Naam"", though, is just terrible.  It's nearly unwatchable.  You have Salman Khan trying to pass himself off as a college student and failing miserably, with his haircut adding insult to injury.  He's a senior, and he takes a liking to a pretty freshman.  When she rejects his romantic overtures, he becomes increasingly obsessed with her and starts to display psychopathic behavior.  He kidnaps her, threatens to kill her and himself, ends up in a mental hospital.  Does it get worse?  You bet.  The girl loses all sense of reality and falls in love with him despite his manipulation and guilt-trips.....

Need I go on?  Really, it's horrible.  Only masochists should treat themselves to this film.",1282262400,,1004,5.0
7987640,2,B00008WQ70,"This is one of those movies where at the end of it all, you are left STILL with a huge question mark. The problem with the movie was not so much the acting, but the script itself. I felt the movie was trying to say something, but what that message is, I am not quite sure. VERY PERPLEXING.

My only problem with this movie was the Love story. It made NO SENSE. We weren't given a solid reason why the Nirjara character should be in love with Radhe AND what really was there to love about Radhe? He did some good deeds, yes, but there are many nice people out there. Why should he stand out? We all know why Radhe loved Nirjara; it made sense. she was pretty, nice, innocent, said prayers, sang, etc. But what about Radhe? Are we to be satisfied just because he goes around helping people he doesnt know through violence? FORGET that often times, other individuals (innocent) get hurt in the process. Are we to find it sufficient, that helping Nirjara's sister is enough basis for so strong a love from the Nirjara character, so pivotal, that she changes her mind about Radhe? Are we to say it is acceptable to kidnap a girl, bind her up, threaten and harass her, confess thoughts of killing/ hurting her all in the name of love? Are we to find it cute that one loves another so strongly it pushes him to violence? and because of that we are to reciprocate the love?

At some point we must beg the question, is this not an unhealthy obsession rather than love? Is this not a tale of an unstable man's pining for a girl, and the unfortunate girl who gets entangled in this web? Not to say the Radhe character deserves no sympathy, he does deserve it, and loads of it. But more than sympathy, his ""loved ones"" should have suggested/ directed him towards psychological therapy when all this began, rather than encouraging him. What this man needed a long time before things took a turn for the worse was THERAPY and REDIRECTION.

So I ask again, what message was the script giving?",1149811200,6,1977,4.410958904109589
