8762783,5,B01GF1DE96,"This DVD should be in every Saint Simons hotel and resort gift shop!  Great for tourists and long time island residents alike.  I have never been to the island but found the presentation quite informative especially on early US History.  I just may have to plan a vacation there soon!  I agree with the previous reviewer who said It is the history of the USA as experienced by one small west coast community, close up and in detail  But I would change that to East Coast ; )  We learn about all of America by concentrating on a particular locations story through out time.  Doster has done just that.  Tracing Saint Simons history from the Native Americans, Spanish and English occupation, Civil and World Wars to the Modern Era.  Thorough, meticulous, and accessible, I learned a lot.  My only critique is that this DVD would benefit with a little appropriate background music coinciding with the era being presented",1469491200,,917,4.746835443037975
8762784,5,B01GF1DE96,"Stephen Doster is a fantastic storyteller, whether in books or videos. Having lived on SSI for eight years, I thought I knew the history. Not. I am SO very impressed with how he chronologically set the stage and brought us up-to-date. I think this should be part of the Georgia History curriculum in all school systems, as well as in all advanced studies of the Georgia coast. This would be a fantastic History Channel documentary, too. After you see this and visit the island, you will be able to connect on such a personal level. Thank you, Stephen!",1467676800,,551,4.63265306122449
8762785,4,B01GF1DE96,"This DVD is not just of interest to locals. It is the history of the USA as experienced by one small west coast community, close up and in detail. Meticulously researched, it starts off with the locations of the native American camps when Europeans first arrived in the area and then takes you through a dozen well defined eras to the modern period. The early chapters are especially intriguing - could Georgia have become Spanish? - yes, if some key battles between tiny armies of a few dozen on each side had gone the other way. What exactly happened to the slave based plantations after the civil war? - find out here. It's the personal stories that crop up in this micro-history that make it feel like 'real' history. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to understand how the USA became the richly varied nation that it is today.",1466035200,,844,4.559210526315789
8762786,5,B01GF1DE96,"I'm a native of Saint Simons Island and have always been fascinated by its history.  The island played a key role in the development of the American colonies and one of least-known but most important battles in the early colonial era was fought here.  Stephen Doster has done a terrific job presenting the history of our beautiful island.  Saint Simons is a treasure and this video provides you with a beautiful portrait of its spectacular beaches, marshes, live oaks people, and history.  I highly recommend it.",1465257600,,512,4.9186046511627906
8762787,5,B01GF1DE96,"The erudite and debonair Stephen Doster was born in England and grew up on St. Simons Island, Georgia. He is a student of history and has extensively researched the Gullah and Geechee cultures of South Carolina and Georgia.  Saint Simons 360 encapsulates St Simons Island's history in one video. It offers an exciting journey around the island and through time, visiting each of six distinct eras as well as historical events that continue to shape the islands identity.  This video is an excellent introduction to island history for students, visitors, and long-time residents.

Seven great books that Doster has written are Jesus Tree, Lord Baltimore, Voices from St. Simons, Rose Bush, Her Finest Hour, Georgia Witness and Shadow Child: Tales of the Georgia Coast.",1465171200,2,767,5.169354838709677
