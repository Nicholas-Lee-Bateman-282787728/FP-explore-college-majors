There seems to be conflict between the Kaboom! DVDs and the Nickelodeon DVDs.  Essentially, Kaboom! has released all of PAW Patrol season 1 on DVD, over the course of 8 DVD titles.  Nickelodeon tends to release a mixture of seasons 1, 2 and now 3, episodes on their titles, with the exception of their first 3 DVD titles (""PAW Patrol"", ""Winter Rescues"", and ""Marshall & Chase on the Case""), which are exclusively season 1 episodes. I hope this helps to clear things up.",1473724800,13,960,4.829268292682927
