8240945,5,B00118DR3M,"I had the opportunity to watch this well written series of the ""behind the scenes palatial walls"" It's a fictional Drama series giving accounts liken to The lives of the Real British Monarchy's everyday private lives. This indeed is life imitating art! Itv would be wise to get a distribution deal to reformat (this made for television originated in  Canada) TV series into a user viewer friendly US region code DVD distribution deal! Perhaps with the assistance of partnering with the likes of Acorn Productions. It will 100% become a viable, profitable business venture to do so! They slept on this sereis in Canada and The UK (of course) . . . ""as it's a little too close for comfort!"" Yet? They should also consider airing it on PBS in The USA. I am well assured that it would fast become be a Modern day  Downton Abbey meets Dallas sensation here in the states!  Itv could easily start a new production deal again to continue this series here in the U.S. It should have never been canceled!",1390435200,2,995,4.610169491525424
8240946,5,B00118DR3M,"What a shame that this highly entertaining series is not avalible on a DVD format that will play on USA DVD players.  Somone
please consider making this available in a US format.",1388620800,,178,4.5625
8240947,5,B00118DR3M,This was a great show. I just spent all day watching all episodes cause I could not stop. So disappointed that it was only one season. Seems alot of British shows I have watched lately are good but never finished.,1376092800,2,213,4.35
8240948,5,B00118DR3M,"I happened upon the UK TV series The Palace last week on Hulu and spent a delightful few days before Christmas watching episodes back to back--enjoying the pageantry, good looking actors, the inside glimpse at what seems to be a fairy tale existence. Others have referred to the stereotypical treatment of the topic--yeah, maybe--but I thoroughly enjoyed it--slightly less Disney princes/princesses meet the intrigue of Dallas with perhaps a little West Wing thrown in? It's West Wing only in that it portrays the interactions/working dynamics of the background staff of the palace,but you can't look for the same snappy, uber intelligent dialogue from the page of the backstairs and the girl who does the palace dusting that you find coming from the lawyers and journalists in the White House. I took the show for what it was--a fictional royal family in a fictional time. I thought casting was excellent--from the Queen mother to the older sister Eleanor to the two brothers (Richard, the new king and playboy George) to the funky little sister--slightly Goth college? student scratchy voiced Isabelle. Roy Marsden (known for his portrayal as P.D. James's Detective Dalgliesh) plays Sir Iain, advisor to the king. The plot advances nicely--Playboy Prince Richard is suddenly, unexpectedly the king after the untimely death of his father. What follows is an exploration of the adjustments required of everyone in this new scenario. Richard now has responsibilities. He doesn't have time to play with brother George. His relationship with his mother has apparently not been a close one. Older sister Eleanor, who by birth order should be Queen but will NOT be unless both of her brothers die--is jealous,feels robbed of the crown, and enjoys Machiavellian manipulation of her family and the staff. Little sister is a typical unsupervised teenaged mess--immature, naive, and unappreciative. When I started watching the show I thought perhaps it was new--and I was REALLY disappointed when I got to the end and discovered that the show dated back to 2008 and that there would be NO MORE.  And just when it was getting interesting...bummer. But there is some closure at the season's end--it doesn't totally leave you hanging. I enjoyed the show and will probably rewatch it when I have time. Good escapist entertainment.",1357430400,8,2317,5.162234042553192
8240949,3,B00118DR3M,"The Palace is basically West Wing with British accents, and a few shades of Upstairs Downstairs thrown in for good measure.  The characters are stereotypes, the dialogue is stereotyped, the situations are stereotyped.  Yet the actors generally do some good work with what they've got, and in spite of itself, The Palace is engaging.  In the last analysis, I have to admit that I kept on kept watching it, right through to the coronation.  And I shan't even mind if there is another series!",1353024000,5,489,4.785714285714286
8240950,5,B00118DR3M,"THERE ARE MANY REASONS TO PUT THIS DVD SERIES INTO U.S.A. FORMAT.
ONE is that it will definitely be a seller amongst those who, like
myself, adore costume and/or royalty dramas.  The second one
is that one of the actresses in this drama, SOPHIE WINKLEMAN, has
reently become engaged to LORD FREDERIC WINDSOR, (close cousin
to Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II), I N...R E A L...L I F E ! (!)
The marriage is to take place on September 12, 2009!  Like the DVDs
of PRINCESS GRACE OF MONACO, any drama in which Sophie Winkleman
will have appeared in, will have great interest to royal-wathchers,
and perhaps the public in general!

Thirdly, a Mr. Harewood appears in this drama.  I do not know if he
is related to the Royal family or not -- but I DO know that another
closely related family to the Royal famil is the Earl of Harewood
and his famiy.

Altogether a fascinating blend of fantasy -- and reality!  Royal-
watchers in the U.S.A., (and Canada!), should have their chance to
buy this series, too!",1242172800,7,999,4.522222222222222
