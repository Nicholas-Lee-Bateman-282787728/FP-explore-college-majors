Beldar Conehead: An owner's manual to a Ford Lincoln Mercury Sable.

Highmaster: Ah.

2822458,3,B000PHX5SM,"These are all great movies I bought this for the Coneheads movie for my daughter. I decided to watch Waynes World and when I put it in the screen showed Philly PPV.

I was in shock I eventually got it to play buy putting it in and contantly pushing the skip button on the player.",1296777600,2,279,4.072727272727272
2822459,5,B000PHX5SM,"It is a great bargain. I really only wanted the Coneheads and it rules the roost but the other two are ok to watch just not great.
Now that Conehead movie is one that should have had a sequel",1291593600,,191,3.923076923076923
2822460,3,B000PHX5SM,"It's the only way to get Stuart Saves His Family which is a cult classic.  SSHF is not even that good or that funny but it is something of a cult movie for people in recovery.  Last time I checked, it was out of print and used copies were being sold for obscene prices.  That's when I figured out this trick...

Coneheads is surprisingly MUCH, MUCH better than I had remembered.  It's the best thing on this DVD.",1250467200,8,412,4.230769230769231
2822461,5,B000PHX5SM,I thought I'd never find Stuart Saves His Family.  I had been looking for a long time -- and it's a triple bonus that Wayne's Word and Coneheads are in the same set.  Love it!,1247616000,11,175,3.9714285714285715

8191484,5,B000PHX5SM,"Great movies.  I hadn't realized that a PG movie like Stuart would have some of the profanity it had, but otherwise a good show.",1474588800,,128,4.333333333333333
8191485,5,B000PHX5SM,"I got this because it has 3 of my favorite movies ever. First of all Wayne's World is simply a classic. Mike Meyers and Dana Carvey star as  Wayne and Garth, who host a public access show from their basement called Wayne's World. Wayne and Garth party on the whole movie. There are lots on great rock songs in this movie from Queen, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Black Sabbath, Tia Carrera, Jimmy Hendrix, Alice Cooper, and Eric Clapton to mention a few. We follow Wayne, Garth and his buddies as they try to get a record deal for Tia Carrera's character Cassandra. This is one of the biggest hits from the folks at SNL, and simply a must see for everyone.

Next is Coneheads, another great movie from SNL. A story about a couple from another planet who crash land on Earth, and assimilate into a normal life in the suburbs, but they are far from normal. They have bald cone shaped heads, and do everything to the extreme. Like consuming mass quantities of chicken embryos, and beer. It is a hilarious ride with Dan Akroyd, Jane Curtain, Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, Michael Mckean, and David Spade. There are many more stars in this movie, and if you have never seen it, you need to.

Lastly is Stuart Saves His Family. This is the reason I got this DVD. It is somewhat of a cult classic. It is another of the movies from SNL. It stars the now US Senator Al Franken, from the old comedy team of Franken and Davis, Laura San Giacomo, Shirley Knight, and Harris Yulin. Not a movie full of stars, but a very competent cast. It is the story of a self help guru, who has a daily affirmation show on public access. His show is cancelled, and he tries to go on with his own life, which is difficult, as he is in a very dysfunctional family. He is a member of several 12 step programs, and has recently lost a ton of weight. His dad is an alcoholic, his sister is an over eater, his brother is a pot head, and his mom tries to hold the family together. It deals with a lot of funny issues, but at the drop of a hat, has you in tears. This is a a story which so many of us can relate to. Stuart tries to teach us that, I'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and dog gone it people like me. For an example look for the video of Michael Jordan daily affirmation. He appeared on the Daily Affirmations with Stuart Smalley on SNL in 1991. The best copy is on nbc.com. This will give you a small insight into this character that the movie is based on, and it is funny as hell. For the money you will spend on this, and believe me it is very cheap, you will not find 3 better movies in my opinion.",1473120000,,2575,4.1875
8191486,5,B000PHX5SM,"While Wayne's World and Coneheads are nostalgic classics, Stuart Saves his Family is a lesser known gem.",1431302400,,104,5.176470588235294

8191491,4,B000PHX5SM,I really just wanted Stuart Saves His Family - but the price was too high! So I ended up getting this combo.  The other two movies don't really interest me.,1367280000,,156,4.2
8191492,4,B000PHX5SM,"Bought the 3 movies because I wanted Stuart.  Not a Wayne's world kind of person - saw some skits on SNL, but not interested in the movie.  Enjoyed Coneheads as a skit, but don't know if I'll ever watch the full length movie.  Very glad to get a copy of Stuart and loving it as much as ever.",1364083200,,291,3.9827586206896552
