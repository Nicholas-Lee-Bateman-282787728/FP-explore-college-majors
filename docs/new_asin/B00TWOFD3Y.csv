7022941,3,B00TWOFD3Y,"By now, you are probably aware of why this was such an important film, (and no, I don't mean the lake scene.) So, I'll save time here and just review the product at hand.

As another reviewer has pointed out, this is indeed a DVR.  There is no disc menu.  No special features. And no restoration has gone into the release of this product. The film quality has quite a bit of noise to it. The sound quality is passable, without any major flaws.

Secondly, and very important to note, THERE ARE NO SUBTITLES DESPITE WHAT THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION SUGGESTS. Subtitles were included in a previous release, which is now out of print and sells for $50 or more.  From what I understand, there is not much difference in film quality between the two releases. So, you will have to decide if the subtitles are worth the extra $40 - $50.
The nice thing is, this is mostly a silent film.  There is very little dialogue, so it's very easy to follow along, and understand what's going on, even without being able to understand the language being spoken.

I truly hope that one day, a company like Kino Lorber, Criterion, or Cohen Media get their hands on the rights to this film, and give it the proper restoration it deserves.",1502496000,27,1211,4.4772727272727275

7022945,2,B00TWOFD3Y,"This is a very cheaply done product. The film came on a DVR, not a silver DVD. There was no indication in the description it would be a DVR. There is also no menu on the DVD. That said, the quality of the film is ok. But this is very cheap for a reason. I guess I should be glad it's not priced over $10 like a Warner Archive DVR.",1481760000,16,330,3.7285714285714286

8703227,2,B00TWOFD3Y,There should be a notice on this movie that it is neither dubbed nor subtitled so unless you are fluent in German (I believe it was German they were speaking)  this may not be the best film for you to enjoy.,1530662400,,207,4.048780487804878
8703228,4,B00TWOFD3Y,"I had just watched a PBS biography on Hedy Lamarr and decided to watch Ectasy. It  just happened to be available on Amazon. Expecting to see an exercize in ancient porno, I found that it was a more sincere exploration into the dichotomy between sexuality and society. This duality exists today.

But in reference to the Hedy Lamarr biography, she took a lot of repercussions in her carreer due to this exploration of the question of erotic pleasure and social restraint. That is what the film was addressing.

Hedy went on to be a great star and an iconic beauty of her time, but never was able to transcend the fact that she had portrayed on screen sexual gratification.

It just happens to be a fact that she was a woman of great intelligence and talent. You can't be a sex symbol and a credible human being at the same time.

Too bad.",1526688000,6,837,4.444444444444445

8703233,4,B00TWOFD3Y,Yes I liked because I saw a sort of silent film with music and words: it is very interesting to value the passage to effective sound at that time. Hedy Lamarr was beautiful but I prefer her in the following better dressed films. The package of the dvd was poor but the price was cheap. I saw well this film in Europe on my dvd reader.,1515456000,3,334,4.075757575757576
