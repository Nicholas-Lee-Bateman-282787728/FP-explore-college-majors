7132300,5,B00WH762AQ,"I usually don't write reviews but I really loved this movie. It was a nice change from your typical lesbian film. This movie is just a simple story about love between two people. It was realistic and I loved the characters. Plus, I wasn't left with the usual horrible ending that occurs in many lesbian films. However, this is just my opinion. I recommend this movie not only because I like it but because I believe that reviews are never a good determinant on whether you should see a movie or not.",1436227200,10,499,4.434782608695652
8713410,4,B00WH762AQ,"A coming of age story of a juvenile delinquent, who falls for a girl from a good family. The one thing they have in common is a love of horses. Starting from that common ground, a friendship develops which in turn becomes something more. This movie is an example of finding one's way through the emotional turmoil of the teenage years. It also shows how someone can change through caring for something other than themselves, in this case horses. It's a good foreign film.",1500681600,,471,4.619047619047619

Also, she found the story riveting and not overly sentimental as such movies often are.  Though not one who has had a special love for horses, I too thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  We live in Kentucky, USA, and are well-qualified to judge stories about the horse culture.",1440201600,3,447,4.842105263157895

Ugh!!  This was slow.  SLOW SLOW SLOW.  Not so bad that I wanted to turn it off, but not much happens here. A bit too much real-time and ordinary life.  I mean, how long can you watch a horse trainer run a horse in circles, round and round and round and round...

At least throw in some hot lesbians!!!  Nope.  Also quite ordinary is the cast.

What basically happens here is that a 16 yr old troubled teen is sent by her adoptive mother to a farm in the country where she'll do an internship there and work with the horses (or maybe just pick up a lot of horse poop).  She's met by a kindly lesbian horse trainer and the two bond rather quick. There is no struggle or personality differences or any real drama between them. Anything with potential drama is quickly resolved.  Alex (the teen) has no cell service and no other modern technological or city-type distractions and so she is engulfed by the isolation and lone company of Nina (horse trainer) for the first bit and it's just the two of them and the horses running in circles, round and round and round...

Alex finds that the older Nina is a lesbian right from the start (unimaginative script and this reveal is a good example of that), and I thought the film might play around with this connection as Alex begins to find herself... don't wait for it. Nothing there.

Eventually, another young girl shows up (Kathy)... an upper class blonde and her horse and because there's basically no one else around, these two young girls end up bonding.  The film did pick up a little with this connection, but not by much.  I really wanted to know Alex's story and what was up with her ""troubled"" life... beyond being a cutter and adopted, not much detail of anything is revealed... or resolved.  Alex is basically never a problem. The blurb does allude to trouble on the farm when the two are left there alone one weekend... lol... but trust me, it's really nothing and is quickly resolved.  Zero skill here in the realm of conflict and drama.

I liked the lovely country setting and it's nothing close to some of the worst lez-themed flicks out there, but it's nothing to rave about either.  If you don't have much of a tolerance for meh and bad lez movies as I do, you'll probably hate it, lol.  It's on Netflix now and I'd suggest watching it there if you've got it.  For those of you who get hot over horses and the ordinariness of everyday life... this is the film for you.

There is a pile of intimacy crammed into the end.  Nina and her girlfriend were far more interesting to watch if you're looking for sexy.  They get the only sex scene (nudity alert), but we don't really get to know them, so... meh.  The teens..... get a happy little ending.

I'm pleased to report that no lesbians die in the end.",1437782400,10,2815,4.428015564202335
