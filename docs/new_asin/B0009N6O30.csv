8063411,4,B0009N6O30,"This volume includes two episodes, both very entertaining. The first one had great sketches (one of which was a Momma's Family) and had some great material highlighting Harvey Korman's and Carol Burnett's comedic talents. The second one had Betty White and Tim Conway. Tim Conway does a great bit as a reluctant counterfeit bill passer. Some good musical numbers in this one!",1293235200,,375,5.064516129032258
8063412,4,B0009N6O30,"Volume 7 is standard Carol Burnett Show fare. The wonderfully dysfunctional Family sketches are, by far, the best offering. And luckily, each show contains a Family sketch!
Semi-regular guest Roddy McDowall reprises his role of Eunice's brother Phillip, a successful screenwriter who invites the family out to Hollywood for a stay in his home--which he gradually regrets. It isn't long until Eunice is wailing about how she got the short end of the stick in sibling affections, Mama (Vicki Lawrence finds her perfect character at last!) continues to fan the fires of familial misery, and Ed (Harvey Korman at his usual best), Eunice's befuddled hayseed husband, is, well, Ed.
Betty White, who was playing the smiling-but-evil Sue Ann Langdon on ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" at the time, appears in the other family sketch which ranks as one of the best. Playing Eunice's well-to-do sister, White is terrific as nasty details come pouring out over their sibling rivalry (White: ""Eunice, remember when your rabbit Fluffy ran away? Well, that WASN'T chicken we had for dinner that night!""). Hilarious stuff!",1244419200,7,1103,5.167597765363128
8063413,1,B0009N6O30,"The ads for any of these volumes are misleading.  They are listed as Volume # and the year with it.  I was expecting the entire season's shows for that year, not 2 shows only.  I'm not sure why a DVD with two shows on it would be listed as a VOLUME???

The cost was outrageous for two shows!  I'm really disapointed and definately won't be buying any more bogus ""Volume"" sets.

The volume 7 was the lowest price and the Volumes 1 through 5 averaged around $112.

The listing needs to be specific about the # of shows on the DVD- if they had been, I never would have purchased it- or maybe that was the plan in their marketing strategy- to mislead the customer.",1198627200,83,660,4.232
