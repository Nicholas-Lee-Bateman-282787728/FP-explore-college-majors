2913172,5,B000TZX62A,"This is easily one of the better animes ever produced. Ive seen my fair share of anime and i can easily say none has tugged on my strings more like this one did. Though, i did feel that it draged for the first ten episodes (slow, but still entertaining), but once you hit episode eleven, this show kicks in to ""OMG-WTF-PWN"" mode. No joke. This show had me by the balls and didn't let go till it was all over (i mean this is the best way possible). I highly recommend this to anyone who a.) needs to see a freakishly good anime b.) someone who is getting into  anime and c.) hates anime and needs a good reason to love it. If your looking at it, don't even bother thinking about it: buy it, and you will love it.",1207353600,,711,4.078571428571428
2913173,5,B000TZX62A,"Gankutsuou, my favourite anime series. I enjoyed it enough to read the 1250 page novel it's based on (The Count of Monte Cristo) after finishing the series, and I'm far from an avid reader. In the end, not only did Gankutsuou become my favourite anime, it also helped me find my favourite book.

I decided to start collecting the series after watching it. It wasn't an easy task to accomplish with me living in the UK and Geneon being dead in the water, but I'll save you the details and simply say that I'm now the happy owner of the art box and all 6 volumes of this truly fantastic series.

The art box, much like the series itself, is most artistic and looks very expensive thanks to the lovely gold font used. The cover of the box has an image of Albert and Edmond standing together, both looking in opposite directions, with Albert holding a sheathed sword and Edmond holding the golden scepter you see him walk about with in the series. The back of the box is equally impressive, showing Albert and Franz looking shocked, with Edmond in the shadows behind them (once again, holding his golden scepter). The spine of the box shows a rather bizarre looking Edmond running, his mouth open in a smile and his left hand held out in front of him. You can tell just by looking at it that a lot effort was put into designing this art box.

The DVD covers aren't bad, either. Like a lot of the DVD's Geneon released prior to their sad demise, all 6 DVD's have reversible covers, meaning both sides have different artwork. Since nearly all the Gankutsuou artwork is beautiful, it's great to be able to turn the covers around if you want a change - It makes me wish more DVD's had reversible covers. I'd also like to add that the reversible covers can be quite useful if, for example, you order a copy of Vol. 4 from SecondSpin and the copy your ordered arrives with one side of the cover damaged.

Moving onto the DVD's themselves, the DVD's have some very nice extras. All 6 DVD's have comments from from multiple Japanese voice actors/actresses, each voice actor/actress briefly summarising an episode each and sharing their thoughts. These comments allow you to put faces to the voices, giving you an insight into their personalities and are, quite frankly, great to see when anime DVD's very rarely have extras. The other extra worth mentioning is an interview with the director of Gankutsuou, Mahiro Maeda, who (if my memory serves me correctly) was interviewed after he watching episode 1 on a cinema screen with the press.

...I'll move onto the anime now. Just believe me when I say that the series is well worth owning on DVD.

Plot: 9.7/10

Not having read the novel prior to starting this, I had no idea what to expect. I knew about certain vague details, such as a young man becoming fascinated with Monte Cristo, but that's all. But, as a result of having no expectations, I was blown away by the story of Edmond Dantes; The Count of Monte Cristo.

In a nutshell, Gankutsuou is a fairly simple revenge story that's executed extremely well. Edmond, posing as The Count of Monte Cristo, is kind on the surface, yet you can tell there's this hatred inside him waiting to explode. He manipulates and kills as his plan to drag the three who wronged him into despair is slowly revealed. There's a twist added to his character in the form of a sort of pact with the devil - He gained the power to get revenge by giving his soul and body in exchange, meaning he loses his humanity bit by bit while getting his revenge.

In order to add mystery to Edmond's character, the story is not told from his perspective (unlike in the book). Instead, the story is told from the perspective of Albert, a young noble and son of Fernand de Morcerf; a general and one of the three Edmond wants revenge against. This brings both bad and good points - the good being the added mystery and a different angle on the story, the bad being Albert having the IQ of a dog. I wanted to kill him when he failed to work out that it was in fact Edmond pulling the strings behind the awful sequence of events unfolding around him for the 10th time.

The setting was quite a shock at first, with the story taking place in the year 5053, where as the novel takes place during the 1800's. It was a further surprise to discover the story starts during the Rome part of the novel, the only difference being that the writers replaced Rome with a city on the moon. I do kinda wish the story had been told in the 1800's instead since very few details are given about the futuristic universe and the setting becomes more of a distraction than anything.

One thing that might upset purists is how the story goes in a different direction than the novel at around episode 18. With Edmond's character being key to the story, Edmond only caring about revenge in the anime was the reason behind the change of direction towards the end. In the novel Edmond was persuaded by Mercds to alter his plans, yet in the anime Edmond turned a deaf ear to her and continued... This one seemingly minor change had a huge impact on how the story progressed beyond that point. Thankfully, Gonzo handled the changes very well, making the finale interesting for people who have read the novel since, if like me, those people would find themselves fascinated by the new angle on Edmond's character.

All in all, the story was a wonderful ride. An adaptation of a timeless classic with artistic differences, it was executed excellently, at times perfectly. You do have to wait for the 'main event' before you discover just how amazingly well told the story is, the first half in particular being nearly all build up, but I still felt compelled to keep watching even without any major twists/events occurring.

Characters: 9.7/10

I liked pretty much the entire cast...apart from the main character, Albert. Although I knew he had to be made rather stupid for the sake of the plot, his stupidity and inability to see the obvious became very annoying after awhile. You'd think he'd be able to put two and two together when Edmond just randomly kept appearing and Edmond himself had told Albert that there were no coincidences!

After reading the book, it became even more clear how stupid Albert had been made in Gankutsuou in order for the story to be told from his perspective. Although Albert was quite impulsive in the book, stupid was not one of the words that entered into my mind whilst reading... If anything he came across as a rather intelligent and likeable character. Believe me when I say that Albert was neither a crybaby nor an idiot in the novel.

Franz, Albert's childhood friend in Gankutsuou (they aren't that close in the novel), shares a close relationship with Albert, the two being near enough inseparable. Unlike in the book, there are definite homosexual overtones, Franz obviously viewing Albert as more than a friend and Albert unable to see it. Franz, like in the book, is a calm and very intelligent character, in many ways being the exact opposite of Albert in the anime. Albert and Franz fall out many times in the anime over Edmond after Franz tries to warn stupid Albert on various occasions about Edmond not being all he seems.

Edmond, the Count of Monte Cristo himself, remains a mystery for most of the series. He acts kind, yet you can tell that underneath he's more like a devil waiting to unleash his true self, wearing a mask to fool those around him. His character differs considerably from the character you see in the book because, where as Edmond views himself as a servant of God in the book, Edmond views himself as a demon of revenge (actually giving his soul to the devil) in the anime adaptation. Gankutsuou's Edmond is certainly an interesting take on a famous character, one that I'm sure would likely have created more discussion had more people read the novel Gankutsuou is based on.

There are many other important characters that also need mentioning:

Note: There are minor spoilers below. Nothing too extreme.

- Eugnie Danglars
The daughter of one of the people Edmond is planning his revenge against, she acts as Albert's love interest in the anime due to the pair being engaged thanks to their parents arranging a marriage. Interestingly, she was a lesbian in the book. It's strange that the writers decided to make Franz homosexual and remove Eugnie's homosexuality in Gankutsuou...

- Mercds de Morcerf
The wife of Fernand de Morcerf, the mother of Albert de Morcerf and former lover of Edmond Dants. She's of vital importance to the story, yet she doesn't appear very often in either the novel or anime. Mercds is the reason Fernand betrayed (I say betray because, unlike in the novel, Edmond and Fernand were friends in the anime) Edmond - he wanted her love, which was impossible for him to get while Edmond was around.

- Fernand de Morcerf / Fernand Mondego
A man whose successes in life have all been based on various acts of betrayal, he married Mercds after condemning Edmond to (what he hoped would be) death by accusing him of something he hadn't done, using Edmond's naivety against him. Since then, he managed to move up the ranks of the army, eventually becoming a general and changing his name to hide his past. At the start of Gankutsuou, it's revealed Albert is his son and that he's attempting to become president of France (anime only).

- Gerard de Villefort
While Fernand was the one who set the ball rolling, Villefort was the one who chose to condemn Edmond when he could've freed him. After seeing the name of his father on a letter Edmond had been given (Edmond not knowing what was in the letter), the ambitious judge decided to destroy the evidence and destroy Edmond's life in order to protect the name of his family. Honour is the only thing that matters to Villefort.

- Baron Danglars
The father of Eugnie, Danglars is the third of the three Edmond wants revenge against in Gankutsuou. Edmond, being honest, stood in the way of the greedy future banker when they worked together in the past. Seeing the chance to get rid of him, Danglars was the person who gave Fernand the plan he used to destroy Edmond, being careful to distance himself from being directly involved. Danglars cares only about money.

...Ok, those are most of the important characters in Gankutsuou - I'm going to be typing forever if I don't stop now. As you can see, the cast is both huge and diverse, which is something you'd expect when this anime is based on such a lengthy and famous novel.

The one glaring omission from the anime cast is one of the most important characters in the book: Abb Faria. Faria saved Edmond from killing himself after he had spent many years alone in the prison of Chteau d'If, giving him renewed hope and someone to converse with. Faria soon become a sort of mentor to Edmond, giving him the vast amounts of knowledge he had inside his elderly mind, ending up changing Edmond from a silly boy to a respectable man. Faria also ended up leading Edmond to fortune by telling him about the treasure hidden on the island of Monte Cristo on his death bed.

In the anime, no explanation whatsoever was given for how Edmond transformed from a naive boy to the charismatic man you see as The Count of Monte Cristo. He doesn't even go to the island of Monte Cristo in the anime, his cave of wonders being moved to underneath his house in France. Although this does work and goes with the changes made to Edmond's character (demon of revenge; not the servant of God he believes himself to be in the novel), Gankutsuou would've had more depth if Faria had at least been shown.

Overall, Gankutsuou has an amazing cast of characters. I do recommend you read the novel if you wish to understand them fully, though - a 24 episode anime can only fit in so much.

Art: 9.7/10
Animation: 9.7/10

The first thing that hits you about Gankutsuou is the rather bizarre CG effect clothing and hair has. The effect is hard to put into words; it's as if the characters clothing and hair are reflective. It certainly takes a few episodes to get used to it. If nothing else, you have to praise the studio behind Gankutsuou (Gonzo) for the huge amount of effort they put in.

The second thing to hit you is the bright range of colours used. If, like me, you went into Gankutsuou expecting to see dark and dull colours, the sort fitting for a tale set in the 1800's, you'd be completely wrong since it's anything but dull, vibrant being a much better description.

As expected of a Gonzo production, Gankutsuou also has a fair amount of CG outside of the clothing/hair effect, including some epic mecha fights. The CG is stunning at times, almost jaw dropping for a TV series.

Overall, Gankutsuou is a joy to watch...once you get used to the unique animation effect. Production values were clearly not low here.

Sound: 9.5/10

First of all, let me say that I didn't think very much of the opening (OP) song: The OP, while fitting, was so dull and slow I had to skip it after watching it once. The ending (ED) song, on the other hand, I did like, the lyrics fitting the show perfectly and the song being fast paced. I feel the ED song would've worked better if it had been used for the OP.

The soundtrack is very high quality, as you'd expect. There aren't too many tracks I'd listen to outside of the series (although there is one AMAZING track), but the music fitted the show like a glove and helped keep the story epic.

I have to mention track 18, one of the best pieces of music I've ever listened to. It was cheek-tinglingly stunning to listen to when it played during the best episode in the series (strangely enough, episode 18!!!), making the sequence even more thrilling than it was already.

Total: 9.7/10

Having watched a fair amount of anime, I'm hard to please. Gankutsuou pleased me.

I recommend this series to everyone: Those who have read the novel and those who haven't. My only suggestion is to watch the anime before reading the novel if possible since we all know how people can be picky when it comes to adaptations.",1203465600,6,14050,4.579848665870172

2913175,5,B000TZX62A,"Gankutsuou is the Japanese anime interpretation of Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo.  Although nothing can surpass Dumas' original story, this interpretation is very fulfilling.  Gankutsuou is a futuristic retelling of the story that focuses on Albert and the relationship with his best friend Franz and the mysterious Count.  The story can get confusing at times, so it helps to be familiar with either the original story or the film adaptations.  The animation style is truly unique.  The background art is extraordinary, but what sticks out is the use of matted patterns as decorations and costume.  The music is also very good.  The opening theme seems out of place at first, but is eventually woven into the story.  Fans of Classical and ambient pieces will enjoy the music within the context of the story.  The story itself is very emotionally gripping.  You will become attached to these characters over the 24 episode arc.  This is probably the best work that GONZO animation has produced.  It is very much a cerebral anime, so fans expecting tons of action should look elsewhere.",1200960000,18,1088,4.983333333333333

2913206,5,B000TZX62A,This anime is tres magnifique!  The classic count of Monte Cristo superbly done in avant garde style. The texturing technique they did ive never seen done like this before. Well the only other time I've seen it was in an Internet video series called plaid ninjas but this is totally awesome k. The most uniquely done anime I've ever seen and they told the count of Monte Cristo very well while also being new and fresh with a scifi twist to the whole thing. It's reminiscent of the movie treasure planet but with count of Monte Cristo instead of treasure island. I would suggest watching it in a language you're fluent in though because the textures are quite distracting and it'll be hard to focus on subtitles while trying to enjoy the strangeness of the texturing they did. All around great anime and that's coming from a casual anime watcher who looks for art and creativity in an anime rather than cliche slapstick and fan service. For someone who enjoys anime as an art form you can't get much better creatively than with gankutsuou. It's excellent.,1441324800,2,1055,4.672043010752688
2913217,4,B000TZX62A,"The music, the voice acting, the interesting visual style... and some great story telling too!

General overview:
It is the story of The Count of Monte Cristo as told (more or less) through the children of those whose lives are being ruined by the count.  It is a great take on a great classic story.  A few minor differences in the core plot, and a lot of additional content that simply isn't in the book, so opinions may vary for those who are hard core on preserving the original story... but in general I think most people will like it, and I generally like it better than the book.

Why only 4 stars?
The video quality.  For a DVD it isn't completely awful... but man could it use a re-render in HD, or even a re-render as progressive SD instead of interlaced.  The visual style is of anime outline and drawing style, and then texture fills instead of gradients.  It is a weird look that takes a little getting use to, but due to the limitations of mpeg2 and DVD size (to say nothing of cramming 6 episodes on 1 disc) you end up with some weird inconsistent texture issues.  For example, in one scene where there is little complexity everything will look fine, but in the next shot that is a little more complex some of the textures go flat or lose detail altogether and become a big colored blob.  And the thing is that while the stand-alone DVDs are a little better with only 3-4 eps per disc, even those are interlaced and not as visually amazing as originally intended.  But as there is no Bluray version available, or even in the pipeline as far as I can tell, this is still good enough quality to enjoy, while costing much less than the original limited release run.

Still an amazing show.  Still worth a purchase.  Still worth watching over again every few years, but it could be a little better quality.  It is unfortunate that it will probably never have enough popularity to warrant a better release on bluray.",1441065600,4,1926,4.45014245014245

2913220,5,B000TZX62A,"When I first heard that Alexandre Dumas's classic novel ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" had been adapted into an anime, I'll admit that I was a bit skeptical as to its quality. As much as I love anime, I just couldn't bring myself to believe that this was the medium best suited at capturing the magic of Dumas's magnum opus. The novel was one of the few required reading texts of my high school days that I truly loved; most books I read I simply tolerated, but ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" sucked me in with its rich characters and bold storytelling. But upon watching this series, I realized how wrong my initial perceptions of it were; what I found was a beautiful reimagining of a classic story told in a respectful and mature fashion.

I think you'll find one of the biggest changes from the original novel is the time period in which the events of the story unfold. Whereas the original novel takes place in the early 19th century, Gankutsuou takes place three thousand years into the future. The Count travels through space just as often as he does on land, and several characters are reimagined as human-looking aliens (Haydee and Ali). I'm a big sci-fi fan, so I appreciated the twist; remember that this isn't a direct retelling, the creators wanted to shake things up so they did (and I must say it pays off).

As for the voice acting, I'm a little biased on the sub/dub issue; as a rule, I've always preferred dubs. Yes, some dubs have been godawful, but I'm happy to report that Gankutsuou has a fantastic dub. Johnny Yong Bosch does a good job as Albert; he really sells the youthful, naive aspect of the character well. However, all praise should go to Jamieson Price who voices the Count; he does an amazing job. His voice really accentuates the mysterious, confident nature you'd expect the Count to display; I can't picture anyone else having done a better job, it was a perfect performance.

Whereas the Count himself was the focus of the original novel, the anime focuses on the young Albert de Morcerf; Albert is a young noble living in Paris, the son of France's highest ranking military officer, General Fernand de Morcerf. Albert is an idealistic, compassionate young man whose life is forever changed when he meets a mysterious gentleman known only as the Count of Monte Cristo. The Count is a man of great wealth and influence, and Albert finds himself quickly drawn to his charismatic nature; he looks up to the Count as a role model, unaware of his true nature and the plans he has set in motion.

If you've read the book, I don't need to tell you anymore about the Count, and if you haven't (you really should, though) I won't spoil it for you here. All I'll say is that the Count is a man who was wronged in the past by people who should have helped him. As you can imagine, he isn't particularly happy about that. I can't say much about the plot without spoiling it for those who haven't read the book.

Albert's storyline is very much a coming of age tale as the person he is at the end of the story is most definitely not the same person he was at the start. His story is one of facing the world head on, of not letting darker emotions such as hate or anger get the better of you. Albert is a good kid who finds everything he knows and believes challenged; he goes through an emotional ringer, to be sure. It's

Not everything that happens in the book is directly adapted into the anime. Some characters in the book aren't featured in the anime, though I can't say this undermines the anime as it is a retelling and not a direct adaptation. There's also the matter of the ending; it's very different from that of the book. However, I will say that it is a fantastic ending nonetheless, and left a major emotional impression on me.

Before closing this out, I must make note of the art style of the show; simply put, it's amazing! The backgrounds are often rendered in 3D, and the art style makes use of Photoshop textures as opposed to traditional hand-drawn animation. All of this adds up to one of the most visually unique anime I have ever seen. Things can get a little confusing, especially in regards to the outfits worn by certain characters, but you'll be dazzled more than you'll be confused. I wish more anime made use of visuals similar to this one, because it really is a treat for the eyes.

Gankutsuou is a triumph on so many levels. Visually, it's one of the most unique and astounding anime ever produced. The dub is great, with a standout performance from Jamieson Price as the Count. And of course, the plot is a dark yet beautiful epic. It retells what in my mind is one of the finest stories ever written, and it does it elegantly and affectionately. The story of the Count of Monte Cristo is a timeless classic that has touched millions of readers over the years, and now it has found new life as an anime that is not to be missed.

In middle school I attempted to read the novel that the anime was based on but never finished it due to its enormous length. While my sister sits nit picking every change the writers made to the story, I find that Gankutsuou is an amazing anime. The anime follows Albert de Morcerf, the son of a wealthy noble family from Paris. On a trip to Luna a chance encounter with a wealthy aristocrat starts Albert and his friends and family down the path to ruin. For Albert is completely unaware of the sins hidden in the past and the true identity of the enigmatic man known simply as the Count of Monte Cristo. Although the novel is told from the Count's perspective, the anime focuses on Albert, and in my opinion adds an air of mystery. If anyone has complaints about the lack of a complete detailed explanation about the Count's history I advise them to either watch one of the many movies that have been made about the book or read the book itself.",1422230400,,1016,4.380952380952381

2913258,4,B000TZX62A,"I have read the original novel by Alexandre Dumas and seen a few of the adaptions that were made in the past.  I loved the book more because it always had a beautiful story to tell.  It was satisfying, dark, compelling, and even heartfelt as well.  I consider the novel to be better than the movie.  The storyline is freaking huge and even the characters are all developed as well.

When I first heard of ""Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo"", I almost felt like Hollywood had done it again and ruined another adaption of the famous novel that has entertained me.  But once I started watching the very first episode, I was hooked from that moment to all the way to the end.  I even finished all 24 episodes within one night (due to them only being 23 or 24 minutes long).  I was very impressed with the graphics and how they are able to capture a lot of stuff.  I know that it is an anime tv series, which is very popular in Japan, but in truth, I have always loved anime.  At least Japan knows how to due their movies.

The series is about the Count of Monte Cristo, only told in a more futuristic version this time.  Instead of Edmond Dantes being the main protagonist, we have Albert Morcerf playing the role as the main guy.  It also takes a point of view on everyone else and also how others suffered the collateral damage of Edmond Dantes's revenge against those who betrayed him many years ago.

I really loved how the whole tv series centers around Albert Morcerf instead of Edmond Dantes, it offers a new point of view and even a lot of mystery to the Count of Monte Cristo, despite that those who are familiar with the novel and other adaptations already know more about the backstory that has led to this moment.  Albert is really kept true to his original counterpart in the novel.  We even get to meet a few other characters from the novel as well, especially those who haven't appeared in the movie adaptions.  Characters like Mercedes, Valentine, Maximilien, Eugenie, Franz, and a dozen others are designed very well and put into roles for the story, allowing them to develop and play a part in the series.  Other small time characters Haydee, Ali, Bertuccio, Baptistin, Luigi Vampa, Julie Herbault, Emmanuel Herbault, and also Benedetto are expanded in the series.  And finally, we get to my favorite part, the villains!  As usual, we have the evil trio Fernand Mondego (aka Count de Morcerf), Baron Danglars, and Grard de Villefort back for more rounds.  However, other characters like Abbe Faria, Jacopo, Peppino, and also Bartolomeo Cavalcanti have been omitted.

The one thing that I love most about this anime tv series is that it is well-paced and well put together.  The storyline does a great job at remaining true to the original novel in its own way.  It has that same atmosphere that the novel once had, with a few minor adjustments and a few new ideas to put into place.  Even the graphics are just amazing.  The characters really play their part very well.  I have to say that this is the greatest adaption of the Count of Monte Cristo ever!

(WARNING: Major Big Time Spoilers Ahead):

The creation of the unknown entity, Gankutsuou, really added something new to the whole story and also a more evil presence.  Even other new ideas like Albert and Eugenie falling in love really do add more excitement and drama to the series.  I also love how we also go deep into Mercedes and how her love for Edmond (aka Count of Monte Cristo) hasn't changed and that she is still and always will be in love with him.  The villains of this story really make this all worth while and help us see the corruption that exists in series and in our world today.  I also love how the Count is portrayed as more vengeful than he is in the novel or any or the adaptions.  And lets not forget the music.  I really love how the music just fits right in with the emotional moments of the series, allowing us to feel the excitement, sadness, and also happiness when it is needed.  The deep friendship between Albert and the Count is done very well too.  It does so well than the book des and allows us to feel for both of them.  I will admit, this is a beautiful tv series and I consider it the best adaption of the Count of Monte Cristo!

However, I do have some issues with the series as well.  There was nothing wrong with the first two acts of the series, they were done extremely beautiful and even the major battle at the very end was just exciting and heartfelt.  But the one problem that I had with the ending was that the Count of Monte Cristo dies.  I couldn't really see the point in that.  With Franz, I can see how his death really makes sense, because his death represents how things are changing and that the Count has gone too far with his vengeance.  But with the Count's death it just didn't feel right to me.  I do love that Albert breaks the bond between Edmond and Gankutsuou, but the fact that he dies doesn't feel like the type of ending I would have went with.  I was hoping that Edmond would finally forgive Fernand and reunite with Mercedes, creating a more satisfying ending for the fans of Edmond Dantes.  The guy has had a tough life and the world wants to see him finally happy.  Either that or a little less vengeful.  I also question why a lot of the characters weren't really present at the final battle of the series or at least not shown.  It just felt like something was missing and I realized that a lot of the characters who were present throughout the series weren't shown at the last battle.  But that's just my opinion.

Another issue that I thought the series really missed was how the Count of Monte Cristo found his treasure and became rich.  If any of you read the book or seen the movies we know that the Count found the treasure with help of Abbe Faira's map, a fellow prisoner from the same prison that Edmond was at, and discovered his wealth on the island of Monte Cristo.  In the series, we don't even get an answer on how he got his wealth at all.  Sure, it is questioned by a few of the characters, but it is never explored.

I also had a problem with the very end of the series, the final part that wraps up the storyline.  It jumps five years ahead, showing that things have changed and that others are trying to move on.  I love that Valentine and Maxilimien are happily in love and living their lives together. I also love that Haydee, along with fellow servants of the Count, are living their lives with happiness as well.  But I was left a little unsatisfied with the endings for Mercedes, Albert and also Eugenie.  We know that Mercedes misses and still loves Edmond, despite what he has done, but I can't find myself moving on from how things end with her.  It feels like unfinished business, like a loose end.  We obviously know that Albert and Eugenie are going to reunite and get married, except that we are left wondering how they reunite!  The ending to this series isn't horrible or bad, it just doesn't create that satisfying atmosphere that needs to be created.  Even the Dark Knight had a better conclusion than this.  But then again, that's just my opinion.

All in all, this is a great tv series!  Despite the dissatisfying ending, this tv series really holds up and does a great job at remaining true to a lot of the elements in the novel.  A lot of the characters' fates are pretty much the same, just done in a whole new way.  Some characters have a different fate from how it is in the novel.  I consider this tv series to be the best adaption of the Count of Monte Cristo ever!  It is beautifully written, the drama is heartfelt, the music is awesome, the graphics are great, and the characters are just amazing!  It even has a more dark theme to it than the novel did.  But like I said, this is just an amazing anime tv series!

I vote that this is worth buying!  I totally recommend it!  Great classics like this only come once in a lifetime!",1378857600,,7926,4.403303509979353

Bear in mind that this is only the second half of the novel.  If you've ever picked up an unabridged copy of The Count of Monte Cristo, you'll quickly see that, for all the immense size of this anime, it's still not as big as the book.

The anime uses a strange visual style to its animation and art that many find distracting and even unpleasant.  I admit freely that it takes some adjustment to properly enjoy the animation, so overall I must admit that, though the series is of masterful quality, the art style generally detracts from the overall effect.",1358035200,,713,4.546875

It doesn't ruin this amazing anime by any means, but it does take away from the beautiful art. If its because they put 6 episodes on each disc, i'm sure they could have spread it out to 6 discs with 4 episodes each to hold onto the sharper image that would allow the art to shine through.

if you're looking for the series to watch and collect then this is a great buy, but remember that sacrifices in image quality had to be made to consolidate 24 episodes onto 4 dvds.",1350432000,9,941,4.14207650273224
2913287,5,B000TZX62A,"Albert and his friend Franz are young aristocrats enjoying Carnival on the Moon.  There, Albert meets and befriends the mysterious Count of Monte Cristo.  Some say he's an alien, some say he's a monster, some even say he's a vampire.  The truth is, he's a man (more or less) out for revenge.  Albert and Franz return to their native France, and Albert introduces the Count to Parisian society.  The plot unfolds over the course of 24 half-hour (well, 22 minute) episodes, but there's enough going on that the story doesn't drag (well, not too much).  The loveless arranged engagements of the young aristocrats and the machinations of their parents provide additional subpolts.

The anime is surpisingly close to the original novel by Dumas.  Nearly all of the large cast of characters and most of the main plot points of the novel are included in the anime.  The main deviations are: being set 3000 years in the future, the exact nature of the Count, and the final fates of the main characters.  Plus, we don't get the Count's back history until much later in the series.

About the look of the anime: some people may find it unbearable.  I don't have a problem with it, in fact, I like it.  There are two issues here, the first (and less distracting) is that the show is ""a riot of color.""  Movies in recent years have gone the opposite direction.  Everything's getting so dull, muddy, and blah.  I swear, some day some genius is going to invent black & white movies.  So to me, the riot of color provides blessed relief.  The second, more distracting element is the ""2-D collage effect.""  Surfaces such as clothing and hair are depicted as two-dimensional surfaces, and as the characters move, the surfaces change in peculiar ways.  For some, this would be a show-stopper, but again, I don't mind it.

The English voice acting is about as good as amine gets.  The opening credit song is pleasant enough, but after a few episodes, I fast forward through it.  The final credit song is a blast (""You won't see me comin'/ til I strike!"").  Additional music during the show helps to set the tone.  Ratings-wise, there's not much that's too offensive.  Well, there's a woman with her hand between her legs at one point, but it's not graphic.  I suppose that bumps it up to PG-13 or so.  (I'd rather not even have mentioned that, but some people would be offended by it, and if your kids would say ""Mommy, what is the lady doing?"" you probably wouldn't want them to watch it.)",1349568000,2,2471,4.618390804597701

Based off the novel, Gankutsuou takes a whole new direction with the addition of the demonic entity, Gankutsuou, controlling and guiding the Count of Monte Cristo on his quest for vengeance.
This was a very interesting show in the first few minutes, combining an odd assortment of identities with the colorful background of royalty within the Parisian community.  However, as time passed, I got the feeling that the director took TOO LITERALLY the mood and actions of the novel's protagonists, as it seemed by the end the characters were... a bit different from what Alexander Dumas had intended.
Though the entire show had me gripped in, making me feel as though I needed to see the next episode, I admit by the end I was very disappointed with how the entire journey had ended.

The opening and ending themes are addicting and the voice actors (both in English and Japanese) did a superb job in delivering the emotion portrayed in each scene. The animation is beautiful, but the prints that they constantly use for clothing or hair...ugh! Still, I think that's part of what made the anime so memorable and fun.

The story, characters, setting, and general themes will have you sucked into the story from the beginning. Redemption, Revenge, Romance, is just the sum of the themes in this anime carried out by brilliant writing and brilliant characters.

Gankutsuou is a tale of a man named Edmond on a path of vengeance for the wrong doing and betrayal that was done to him by his friend. After making a pact with a special power, The Count of Monte Cristo vowed to destroy the lives of those that betrayed him and begins pulling strings and manipulating people around him in order to begin his road to revenge. A young boy, Albert, that is closer to The Count than he knows, meets him and admires him, and unexpected to him and everyone in Paris, The Count is just only beginning to carry out his plans. Manipulating everyone around him in order for the perfect set-up to reveal his ture self, The Count reveals himself to the ones whom betrayed him. The Count reveals himself to be Edmond Dantes which causes a stir between some important people in Paris-- ones that were in the act of betrayal. The Count's vengeance will truly be fulfilled with the death of Albert, the son of his once fiancee and lover. However, unlike The Count, through his best friend Franz, Albert learns to forgive and love instead of hate, and forgives The Count which breaks the pact between Edmond and Gankutsuou leaving Edmond human again just suddenly before he passes away. The story concludes five years later as Albert and his, at one time fiancee, Eugenie, reunite together again as they are in love, and carry out a happy life toegther.",1326412800,2,1698,4.66

2913338,2,B000TZX62A,"I've got to say, that despite my review being low, there are aspects of this show I really liked. First of all, this actually is one of the more loyal adaptations of the Count of Monte Cristo there has been in media... at least for the first half of it. Costume design, and setting design are nothing short of amazing. I loved the Count's underground world, as well as the characters clothes, particularly the dress Haydee wears at her first viewing of Fernand. Just to see Haydee and Nortier, characters so important to the Count of Monte Cristo universe but often neglected by adaptations of the story, made me very happy.

But tragically, a lot goes wrong here as well. A lot of anime stereotypes and melodrama are injected into the formula, that I really ended up rolling my eyes over. Do two noblemen really need to fight with swords when they have a disagreement about the philosophy of love? Really? Are anime viewers really that ADD? Do we really need to watch one of the secondary characters pleasure herself? Do we really need one of the bad guys to have ambitions to take over the world? I rolled my eyes a LOT during this anime, mostly at inventions of the anime itself. The ending, where it strays from the original story is a complete mess. The comeuppance of a lot of the bad guys in this is much, much less satisfying than it was in the novel, and not only are the fates of several characters altered, the theme of the entire piece is altered. An essential part of the Count's story is learning to forgive, and he's simply not given the opportunity to do that here. With the elimination of that, a lot of the depth of the novel, and part of what made that novel a classic, simply fades into oblivion. Not that I'm a softy. There were a lot of deadly moments in the Count of Monte Cristo that I missed here too, mainly dealing with a particular son of the Villefort clan...

I feel that they really dropped the ball here. You simply can't out-narrarate Dumas, and his classic story of revenge. I'm not against changing things per se, but if you're going to change something, change it for the better and don't screw up what works. Most of the changes and innovations here, outside of the aesthetic beauty of the anime, are for the worse.",1293408000,14,2252,4.476885644768856
2913339,5,B000TZX62A,"As an avid fan of both the original novel and this series, I'm really impressed with Funimation for picking up this title after the implosion of Geneon. There are plenty of awesome reviews that explain the series's plot, animation style, and soundtrack, so I'll stick to the things that haven't been covered. This edition is a box set, but it's smaller than you might think: The box contains two slim-pack DVD cases with two disks in each. The set's art on both the cover and actual dvd cases definitely matches the nature of the series. And don't worry, the ""SAVE"" sticker is only on the plastic packaging. ;D

As for the actual story, this version of the classic tale revolves around Albert de Morcerf instead of the mysterious Count himself. This in turn causes some changes in the perception of the story as well as adds in parts to the series that Dumas really wouldn't have expected or intended. However, the drama between Albert, his fiancee Eugenie, and his best friend Franz can be easily overlooked. The series does exactly what it's supposed to: captures the essence of Dumas's genius tale of revenge and holds your suspense at every turn.

The twists, the turns, the heartbrakes, the revenge, the scandals.... It all comes together to form one of the most complex and compelling anime's I have ever seen. The episodes seem slow and can be confusing if not watched in order, but once the viewer has seen every episode, the story comes together and leaves nothing for wonder. Some people don't like that, but I try to stick with the series' that actually come to conclusions. It's like watching a really long movie.

It's amazing that a show of such a high caliber on every level, a show which is not always easy, could find an eager audience on television.  There is nothing like Gankutsuou coming from the US, Hollywood or otherwise, and certainly coming from a country which produces outstanding animes annually, Gankutsuou is something special.  Gonzo really put their balls to the wall with this show and boy, is it apparent!  Few shows manage to do what Gankutsuou does in a single episode with such grace, poise, and flat out audacity...this is one of those series which must be seen to be believed.

Mahiro Maeda has managed to capture the spirit of Alexandre Dumas's retelling of Norman Stiles's original work, while also introducing new and interesting elements.

2913357,5,B000TZX62A,"Every so often a truly epic anime comes along that seems to totally slip under the radar...and Gankutsuuou is one of the greatest diamonds in the rough of all time. I don't know if people were put off by the fact that it's an adaptation of a historical french novel, or if Genon simply didn't do a good enough job of advertising it...but either way, this show deserves WAY more credit than its getting. I hadn't even heard of this gem until I came across the trailer and my jaw dropped in awe.

This is a tale of betrayal and vengance, a classic aristocratic soap-opera revamped as a space-opera (and exceptionally well done, not melodramatic or cheesy at all and chanelling the heart of the book - I think Alexandre Dumas would have been proud), and as every episode twists and turns and ends on a cliffhanger you are always left tearing your hair out until the next installment, hungry to know what happens next. The animation is superb, bulging with fluid-CGI, crisp colours and beautiful character designs. The sad, lamenting opening 'we were lovers' and energised, vengeance-themed ending 'you won't see me coming' really fit the style of the show. Bandai outdid themselves on the dub too - fan favourite Johnny Bosch handles the role of naive hero Albert with his usual lovable ease, and major points to the guy playing the Count of Monte Cristo - I've not heard him before, but he's OUTSTANDING in the role.

I cannot urge you enough to buy this set - the content aside, the collection is drool-inducing for any otaku who likes to fill their shelves with plush, expensive-looking boxed sets. Not only is it proper, hard cardboard (they don't make em like this anymore!) but the artwork on it is amazing and foily, so it shines in the light! It is by far and away the prettiest boxed set I own. When it first arrived I squealed so loud in delight that the neighbours heard! For only $30 (go to Rightstuf!) for the entire series plus this fantastic collector's box it is a STEAL - the greatest anime bargain you will ever find.

I'm just over halfway through it, but it has already jumped up my list of all-time faves right alongside FMA, Wolf's Rain and Samurai Champloo. Yes. It is THAT good. You will love Gankutsuuou if you enjoy dark, thrilling supernatural dramas such as Le Chevalier D'eon. Highly recommended!",1271030400,,2322,4.644768856447689
2913358,5,B000TZX62A,"I REALLY liked this anime a lot, and let me tell you, I am VERY CRITICAL of anime. The reason this was good is because it tells the original classic from the perspective of Alber, the antagonist's son, rather than from the perspective of the count/protagonist. Furthermore, although it does not stick to the original story specifically, where it differs it does so very well to the point where I actually like this version better than the original story. Furthermore, the artwork/animation is AMAZING and the style is totally different from the generic art work you see in all other animes (I can't really describe it, you have to see it for yourself).

Unfortunately, it has a couple of scenes with giant mecha fighting (I cannot understand the Japanese obsession with giant mechas, especially in an anime such as this), but the story is so good that I can overlook this.

Definitely make it part of your collection if you haven't done so.

2913359,5,B000TZX62A,"Ironic that Japanese manga artists treated one of my all time favorite books by Dumas with much more respect than ANY movie makers that attempted to bring this story to the big screen. I am one of those annoying people who thinks that if you are bringing classical story to the screen you owe it to the story to stay true to its spirit. Of course there are cuts to be made when movie is done, but PLEASE let the story be recognisable. This is as far as I am concerned the first interpretation where I can see the story as Dumas envisioned it, NOT just the bare bones of it, or something totally unrecognisable. I loved it, I loved it even if they moved the story centuries in the future (and yes, still made 19 century France to be recognizable, amazing if you think about it). And I have had no problems with the ending. Even if ending is in a sense the biggest change from what is happening in the novel, I think in a sense it stays true to its spirit too. In a book Edmon is restored to his true self by love, and here he remembers his true self because of love too. To me it is as simple as that.

and no i am not upset that it is not shonen ai,i just wanted people to know that its only fan fictions that make it that way,not the real canon.

excuse my english it is not the best and i edited this review realizing a whole sentence is missing.

*SPOLIER* DO NOT READ BELOW IF YOU DO NOT WANT MINOR SPOILERS.

first off these are aristocrats,that are indeed in the future however its society is like old france,where all men seemed a bit gay,even the super straight men,thats just how french aristocrats are.

the boy loves his fiance,blah blah blah the count has many more hints to read into loving mercedes and haidee blah blah blah just as in  the book and movie.in fact he still wants to kill albert with his dying breath.and THIRD AND MOST IMPORTANT if you've read this book,ends way worse and not how you read in the book,no running off with Haidee.
or seen the popular movie where... ALBERT IS HIS SON!!!!

so don't let this throw you off,ignore what youve heard,if you like the book,you will like this variation on the story,it is a really creative series,and the unique animation makes it worth seeing once even if you don't care for the count of monte-cristo.

The book was definitely more detailed, yes, but for those of us who have only seen the jam-packed movies for this classic, we're mislead to believe the story is the average tale of being wronged and getting revenge.
Finally, a screen-set story that fits the encumbered emotional and dauntingly complex and puzzling full story. Gonzo did not, of course, get the whole book in here, but they certainly at least tried and did a dang good job of it.

I mean, come on now. Can you really deny the glee you get when a good man who's life has been ruined returns from the grave to perplex, confuse, and drive the people who wronged him insane? How about the morbid giggles you get when an overzealous rogue of a man is borderline insane but somehow making everything he touches crumble into madness?

You know you love it.

For those of us who are still skeptics about the classicness of so-called classic tales, this is the perfect way to force the ""have to know what really happens in more detail"" down on a television addicted time. If you don't care who The Great Gatsby was or why there was A Tale of Two Cities, you'll at least have the satisfaction of saying you knew who The Count of Monte Cristo was.

So many other people have said what I don't need to, the series is amazing, the animation and style and effects are breathtaking, and it is definitely something different from other anime when it comes to the animation.  Its very interesting to see how and what they use for some stills and characters. Everything is so personal about the characters and what comes of them and their design.

2913363,4,B000TZX62A,"Never let it be said that modern anime is particular about where it draws its inspiration.  The concept of creating a series based on a novel written in 1844 then setting it in the year 5053 sounds like a far stretch for any production staff and yet somehow, someway Mahiro Maeda (the director of Blue Submarine No. 6) manages to pull it off in Gankutsuou with style.  The novel of course is none other than Three-Musketeer's author, Alexandre Dumas' Count of Monte Cristo (in case you somehow missed this series' title).

Here in the United States, this is a re-release by Funimation of an earlier Geneon DVD release of basically the same name.  Side note: Geneon typically labeled the show Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo while Funimation flips the order to The Count of Monte Cristo: Gankutsuou.  Other than that the only difference is that rather than spreading the 24 episodes across six discs, Funimation manages to do it in four (packaged in a pair of beautiful thin packs within a subtle cardboard outer case).  The source material comes to us via the brilliant minds of Japanese anime studio Gonzo; who themselves bring a long list of unique, thought-provoking titles to the table (such as their 2007 anime adaptation of Romeo and Juliet).

This set, as has been the trend of late, contains virtually no extras to speak of although the language options are thorough (English dub and original Japanese with or without English subtitles).

The story is setup to appeal to fans of the original work and those with no prior exposure alike as it retains all of the key plot points but adds a few new elements and tells it from a totally different perspective (kind of like what John Gardener's novel Grendel does to the classic Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf).

The Count of Monte Cristo: Gankutsuou tells the epic tale of a wrongfully accused man's intricate plot of exacting revenge through the relatable doings of a fifteen-year-old aristocrat from Paris named Albert (pronounced ""al-bear"" in homage to the French author's original motif).  As stated above, the show goes to great lengths to establish an atmosphere stunningly reminiscent of 19th century France while integrating just enough technology to remind the viewer that this is, in fact, the future- and the very distant future at that.

Pacing is deliberately slow and thorough and really compliments that rather dry-nature of the source material.  However, while this may be viewed as a negative with some shows, Gankutsuou turns the story telling element into an art form in and of itself.  This is adult anime and not because of the usual pitfalls that eliminate younger viewers from the equation.  Rather than sexual references, violence and language, Gankutsuou can be called mature on account of its sophistication and mood-appropriate visuals.

In fact it is nearly impossible to find a review of the show that doesn't trip all over itself in praise for the artistic vision and unique animation style.  The best way to describe it is imagine near photo-realistic textures layered behind transparent character models.  If that sounds odd to you, rest assured, it is but somehow it works.  What makes the visuals so unique is that the textures are static, meaning they don't move even when the character boasting them does.  It's one of those traits so unique that you may go as far as to label it distracting early on yet it manages to become subdued as the viewer loses himself in the ever-thickening plot.  Even by the later episodes there are a few ugly examples of where texture-overloaded scenes come off as overly busy or muddled but as a whole, the source material literally benefits from this unique art style.

If there were a single complaint worth mentioning about the show it would have to be the simple reality that this isn't run of the mill anime by any sense of the word.  It's pretty difficult to place the show into a genre in fact.  The story is, quite frankly, unlike any other seen in modern anime, which I suppose is to be expected when you remember that this is classic literature in animated form.  Viewers expecting scantly clad women, characters with abnormally large and watery eyes, or slapstick of any kind need not apply.  Being that the setting does take place in the distant future, there are a few robotic fight scenes (duels that wouldn't look out of place in Escaflowne) and some pretty cool space travel concepts.

As a whole, though, it would be easy for viewers with a short attention span to become bored.  There's a steady and reliable flow to the plot that requires patience and a bit of maturity (or at the very least, an appreciation for fine culture).

When directly compared to the original novel, some may scoff at the fact that there is a slight supernatural angle that acts as the backdrop here.  Without revealing too much of the actual mystery presented within, let me just comment on the character of Edmond Dantes allowing an insalubrious entity (Gankutsuou) possession of his body so as to escape imprisonment and to realize his ambitions of revenge.  A fan of the original work, it is a bit disappointing personally to note that Edmond's creativity in escaping his prison was omitted here.  Worse still is that while the original can be viewed essentially as a cautionary tale in the dangers of allowing vengeance to overtake one's life, here the metaphor is perhaps taken a bit too literally.  Otherwise, and especially true for those not tied to the beauty of the original work, the supernatural elements do go a long way in adding intrigue and creepiness to the formula.

The show's music score is not only hauntingly appropriate; it's at times, dare I say, catchy (especially the opening theme which is about as unique as they come).  Throughout are rich piano scores and solid symphonic pieces.

In all, Gankutsuou: the Count of Monte Cristo is one of the most unique properties of all time to grace anime ideology.  With a timeless story, unique art style, and underlining themes that nearly anyone can benefit from in their own lives, Gankutsuou reminds us all that modern art is far from dead; if even only the result of rejuvenating the classics as the case may be.",1240963200,26,6201,4.844549763033175
2913364,5,B000TZX62A,"Gankutsuou, my favourite anime series. I enjoyed it enough to read the 1250 page novel it's based on (The Count of Monte Cristo) after finishing the series, and I'm far from an avid reader. In the end, not only did Gankutsuou become my favourite anime, it also helped me find my favourite book.

I decided to start collecting the series after watching it. It wasn't an easy task to accomplish with me living in the UK and Geneon being dead in the water, but I'll save you the details and simply say that I'm now the happy owner of the art box and all 6 volumes of this truly fantastic series.

Plot: 9.7/10

Not having read the novel prior to starting this, I had no idea what to expect. I knew about certain vague details, such as a young man becoming fascinated with the Count of Monte Cristo, but that's all. But, as a result of having no expectations, I was blown away by the story of Edmond Dantes; The Count of Monte Cristo.

In a nutshell, Gankutsuou is a fairly simple revenge story that's executed extremely well: a young man called Edmond Dantes loses his freedom, his love and almost his life because of the greed, jealousy and pride of three men. Then, after many years, he returns, posing as the Count of Monte Cristo - a rich 'noble' who appears out of nowhere and sends shockwaves through Paris with his riches - and puts into action his plan to get the ultimate revenge on the men who destroyed his life. After spending many years suffering, he doesn't simply want to kill them: he wants to destroy them, throwing them in the pits of despair.

In order to add mystery to Edmond's character, the story is not told from his perspective (unlike in the book). Instead, the story is told from the perspective of Albert, a young noble and son of Fernand de Morcerf; a general and one of the three Edmond wants revenge against. This brings both bad and good points - the good being the added mystery and a different angle on the story, the bad being Albert having the IQ of a dog. I wanted to kill him when he failed to work out that it was in fact Edmond pulling the strings behind the awful sequence of events unfolding around him for the 10th time.

The setting was quite a shock at first, with the story taking place in the year 5053, where as the novel takes place during the 1800's. It was a further surprise to discover the story starts during the Rome part of the novel, the only difference being that the writers replaced Rome with a city on the moon. I do kinda wish the story had been told in the 1800's instead since very few details are given about the futuristic universe and the setting becomes more of a distraction than anything.

If you ignore the fact that the story isn't told with the events occurring in chronological order (like in the novel), one of two things that might upset purists is how the story goes in a different direction than the novel at around episode 18. With Edmond's character being key to the story, Edmond only caring about revenge in the anime was the reason behind the change of direction towards the end. In the novel Edmond was persuaded by Mercds to alter his plans, yet in the anime Edmond turned a deaf ear to her and continued... This one seemingly minor change had a huge impact on how the story progressed beyond that point. Thankfully, Gonzo handled the changes very well, making the finale interesting for people who have read the novel since, if like me, those people would find themselves fascinated by the new angle on Edmond's character.

All in all, the story was a wonderful ride. An adaptation of a timeless classic with artistic differences, it was executed excellently, at times perfectly. You do have to wait for the 'main event' before you discover just how amazingly well told the story is, the first half in particular being nearly all build up, but I still felt compelled to keep watching even without any major twists/events occurring.

Characters: 9.7/10

I liked pretty much the entire cast...apart from the main character, Albert. Although I knew he had to be made rather stupid for the sake of the plot, his stupidity and inability to see the obvious became very annoying after awhile. You'd think he'd be able to put two and two together when Edmond just randomly kept appearing and Edmond himself had told Albert that there were no coincidences!

After reading the book, it became even more clear how stupid Albert had been made in Gankutsuou in order for the story to be told from his perspective. Although Albert was quite impulsive in the book, stupid was not one of the words that entered into my mind whilst reading... If anything he came across as a rather intelligent and likeable character. Believe me when I say that Albert was neither a crybaby nor an idiot in the novel.

Franz, Albert's childhood friend in Gankutsuou (they aren't that close in the novel), shares a close relationship with Albert, the two being near enough inseparable. Unlike in the book, there are definite homosexual overtones, Franz obviously viewing Albert as more than a friend and Albert unable to see it. Franz, like in the book, is a calm and very intelligent character, in many ways being the exact opposite of Albert in the anime. Albert and Franz fall out many times in the anime over Edmond after Franz tries to warn stupid Albert on various occasions about Edmond not being all he seems.

Edmond, the Count of Monte Cristo himself, remains a mystery for most of the series. He acts kind, yet you can tell that underneath he's hiding something; wearing a mask to fool those around him. His character differs considerably from the character you see in the book because, where as Edmond views himself as a servant of God in the book, Edmond views himself as a demon of revenge in the anime adaptation. Gankutsuou's Edmond is certainly an interesting take on a famous character, one that I'm sure would likely have created more discussion had more people read the novel Gankutsuou is based on.

The one glaring omission from the anime cast is one of the most important characters in the book: Abb Faria. In the novel, Faria saved Edmond from killing himself after he had spent many years alone in the prison of Chteau d'If, giving him renewed hope and someone to converse with. Faria soon become a sort of mentor to Edmond, giving him the vast amounts of knowledge he had inside his elderly mind, ending up changing Edmond from a silly boy to a respectable man. Faria also ended up leading Edmond to fortune by telling him about the treasure hidden on the island of Monte Cristo on his death bed.

In the anime, no explanation whatsoever was given for how Edmond transformed from a naive boy to the charismatic man you see as The Count of Monte Cristo. He doesn't even go to the island of Monte Cristo in the anime, his cave of wonders being moved to underneath his house in France. Although this does work and goes with the changes made to Edmond's character (demon of revenge; not the servant of God he believes himself to be in the novel), Gankutsuou would've had more depth if Faria had at least been shown.

Overall, Gankutsuou has an amazing cast of characters. I do recommend you read the novel if you wish to understand them fully, though - a 24 episode anime can only fit in so much.

Art / Animation: 9.7/10

The first thing that hits you about Gankutsuou is the rather bizarre CG effect clothing and hair has. The effect is hard to put into words; it's as if the characters clothing and hair are reflective. It takes a few episodes to get used to it. If nothing else, you have to praise the studio behind Gankutsuou (Gonzo) for the huge amount of effort they put in.

The second thing to hit you is the bright range of colours used. If, like me, you went into Gankutsuou expecting to see dark and dull colours, the sort fitting for a tale set in the 1800's, you'd be completely wrong since the colours are anything but dull, vibrant being a much better description.

As expected of a Gonzo production, Gankutsuou also has a fair amount of CG outside of the clothing/hair effect, including some epic mecha fights. The CG is stunning at times, almost jaw dropping for a TV series.

Overall, Gankutsuou is a joy to watch...once you get used to the unique animation effect. Production values were clearly not low here.

Sound: 9.5/10

First of all, let me say that I didn't think very much of the opening (OP) song. The OP, while fitting, was so dull and slow I had to skip it after watching it once. The ending (ED) song, on the other hand, I did like, the lyrics fitting the show perfectly and the song being fast paced. I feel the ED song would've worked better if it had been used for the OP.

The soundtrack is very high quality, as you'd expect. There aren't too many tracks I'd listen to outside of the series (although there is one AMAZING track), but the music fitted the show like a glove and helped keep the story epic. I also loved how classical music was chosen - it made the experience feel even more special to hear both unedited and edited versions of some of the most famous classical music in existence playing alongside the animation.

I have to mention track 18, one of the best pieces of music I've ever listened to. It was cheek-tinglingly stunning to listen to when it played during the best episode in the series (strangely enough, episode 18!!!), making the sequence even more thrilling than it was already.

The selection of classical music (some remixed for the anime), excellent newly created music and one the most fitting ED songs of all time make 9.5/10 a fair score.

Total: 9.7/10

Having watched a fair amount of anime, I'm hard to please. Gankutsuou pleased me, with every area surpassing my expectations. It's a rare, rare feeling to end anything and feel near enough completely satisfied, and I can't see me enjoying another anime as much for a long time.

I recommend this series to everyone: those who have read the novel and those who haven't. My only suggestion is to watch the anime before reading the novel if possible since we all know how people can be picky when it comes to adaptations.",1234051200,82,10114,4.560088202866593
2913365,5,B000TZX62A,"Studio GONZO has never really been known for anything great except for a few surprise hits like Last Exile and others. Most of the time, they produce duds or simply decent shows. When they opted to adapt The Count of Monte Cristo, in the form of their anime Gankutsuou, some probably snickered while others likely felt a little bit of themselves die. There were those who wanted to believe that it would be good but you can never hope for too much with Studio GONZO. Luckily GONZO defied the expectations of apologists and naysayers and produced high art.

Fortunately this is not a slavish adaptation of the original because there would be no point in seeing it if that was the case aside from seeing classic characters and events animated. Instead, the storyline takes place in futuristic Paris and the main protagonist is Albert and his friends. He meets the Count on the moon in contrast to the novel in Italy. The Count is also seemingly a blue-skinned alien as opposed to human within the novel. Albert is taken with the Count and after being rescued by bandits on his part, invites him to Parisian society. However, not everyone is so worshipful of the Count as Albert is. Albert's mother acts strange around him, some of Parisian society is suspicious of him, and his private dealings are explicitly malicious. The Count wants something and his mere presence worries people and spins a web independent of his intents that ensnares them, forces them to confront their past misdeeds, and ruins them and their loved ones. No one is safe.

The plot is essentially the same in the Count wants revenge and the characters' roles in society are parallel to the book too. However the story is drastically different in the characters' reactions to the events around them as well as how the story twists. Franz is far more of a central character than he was in the book and Eugenie's actions and relationships with the other characters are different too as well as carry more weight. The different plot decisions still carry the spirit of Dumas's work and some betray the true nature of the characters that were only hinted to in the book. Gankutsuou exists both as a superb anime as well as a sound literary criticism of The Count of Monte Cristo.

One of the best things done in this show is how every scene and character has a point. There is not a single filler episode with a villain or character narrating the entire thing or the entirety composed of flashbacks. Fortunately every scene is a development in itself, packed with emotion that develops the characters. The scenes and imagery used also convey an objective symbolic quality to them, something rarely seen in anime. The characters can all be related to each other in the story's terms or for storytelling terms such as foils and doubles, even those who rarely interact with each other. Director Mahiro Maeda conveys a strong sense of confidence in telling the story in a no-holds barred manner since there are no long dramatic scenes dealing with mourning characters' deaths or events. That is not to say there are no mourning scenes or such. But they are used to establish character motivations and frameworks for future decisions and then quickly move onto other aspects of the story. It is done in such a fashion so that you never feel your time is wasted.

The animation is different and has received applause and criticism. Some textures of characters' clothes will not have a single color applied to them but instead have an artsy static pattern imprinted onto it that is not animated. The effect in itself is stunning but there are scenes when the effects are required to be marvelous. For example, instead of a simple blonde texture in her hair, at the opera Eugenie will also have sparkling effects imprinted upon her hair like glitter. It really adds to the atmosphere of a scene.

The music is also something behold. The show will invoke classical pieces at times and the music composed by the studio's staff is also excellent. The English dub leaves something to be desired and is simply competent against the Japanese voice actors who convey their actions with appropriate emotion. The English dub also left out the introductory narrations to episodes in French, which it must be mentioned, sounds superb. The show knows that it is a high class affair and the French adds a level of authenticity since this is Parisian society. Given who the voice belongs to, the French language also lends a sense of other-ness to the character contrasted to the Japanese speakers.

There are few legitimate classics in all mediums of storytelling. Anime has its renowned classics such as the works of Hayao Miyazaki and others that are relatively unknown to the mainstream public such as Metropolis. Gankutsuou is a member of the latter and should further assure those who appreciate real art.",1210982400,2,4855,4.801435406698564
2913366,5,B000TZX62A,"Wow.  This is the initial impression one gets upon stumbling onto this masterpiece of animation.  The visuals of this television series are on par with anything I've ever seen anywhere in any format.  Stylish, otherworldly, beautiful, and unique are just a few of the adjectives that I'd use to describe the look of this show; a retelling of the classic vengeance tale in a first-rate science fiction setting.  In this version of Dumas' legendary story, the lust for vengeance is literally a malignant parasitic entity, Paris is the seat of earthly power, duels are settled in the most Japanese way possible (giant robots with swords!), and corrupt officials with falsified titles(and skeletons in their closets) tear each other to pieces grabbing at money and power.  My kind of show.

Not enough can be said about the art and animation of this show.  Colors go from muted to vibrant depending on the scene, CG is integrated seamlessly in truly creative ways, the character designs are among the finest I've seen in anime, even the backgrounds are outstanding.  You could spend an entire show marvelling at any one aspect of the art design: the character's hair and costumes, their faces, the settings.  Magnificent.  But visuals alone don't make for a great show.  Thankfully, the Gankutsuou universe is filled with endearing characters with well fleshed-out personalities, plenty of personal drama, and -as I mentioned- some serious skeletons hiding in their closets.  The Count himself is an outstanding protagonist/sympathetic villain who carries himself with all the predatory charm of a suave vampire and even in his most heartless moments forces you to admire him.  Pleasant and debonair one minute, sorrowful the next, and utterly menacing at other times, this is a great character, period.  The hero of the story is Albert, a young pawn in Monte Cristo's game of revenge.  He may be the least interesting character in the show, but his blandness and purity of heart makes for a great contrast taht allows the rest of the cast to shine.

If you are into animation in any way, shape, or form consider this a must-see.  The ending let me down a little bit as the final epilogue is literally 20 minutes of anti-climax that answers no questions and offers precious little of what made this series such a fantastic ride.  But, corny ending aside, there is absolutely nothing I didn't love about this anime.  I deserves to take it's place as a modern classic.",1207440000,8,2462,4.9464720194647205
