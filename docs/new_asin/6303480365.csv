It's a semi-documentary...or perhaps...a documentary ""Fellini style"".  It's worth watching a couple of times to catch all of the subtle plays.  If you're not a Fellini fan and don't like clowns or the circus, you will probably end up confused. :)",1393977600,,396,4.695652173913044
661224,2,6303480365,"A lovely, uplifting and colorful film, the version currently available on instant video is indeed the Synergy Entertainment transfer. Grainy, soft edges, and dull color, Synergy Entertainments release is instantly disappointing. For $10 to $15 more, I opted for the Raro Video BD version of the film, which has a much better transfer and includes some interesting extra features in a package not unlike the Criterion Collection. Used and new copies are readily available on Amazon Marketplace. Addio, amici.",1380931200,,507,5.430379746835443
661225,5,6303480365,"How lucky we are to have this wonder available, as copyright problems have kept it out of European cimenas for decades. If there has ever been a better film, I haven't seen it. It rings as true now as when I saw it as a student in Paris in the seventies. Yes, the pathos is milked for all it is worth, but the acting is glorious, and it seems as if the circus hasn't left town yet. Enjoy. John Bald",1145318400,,398,3.9875
661226,5,6303480365,"If you thought everything was said about the childhood universe with Willy Wonka , Wizard of Oz , Mary poppins or Fantasy , sorry you made a wrong choice .

The circus world is one of our invisible links with our childhood . And no one as Fellini free spirit to make a glorious homage to the clowns and the circus meaning in our lives .

Haunting , beautifully filmed and exhilarating script will amaze you over and over again.

Fellini showed once more why he , Tarkovsky and Bresson were the freest filmakers in all the cinema story .

A thousand carats gem !",1101168000,3,561,4.314285714285714
661227,5,6303480365,"Fellini sees the grotesque, the ugly, the pathetic, and funny side of clowns. After showing us how clowning mirrors the grotesques of ordinary life he steps into the role of a documentary filmmaker with a bumbling crew trying to recover the great clowining of the past. He doesn't find it by interviewing pathetic old retired clowns, but he recreates it in a final extravaganza--a clown funeral complete with men in horse suits and a clown fire company. I understand a lot about Fellini's other movies after seeing his nostalgic recreation of clowning. This is one of Fellini's best--direct, unpretentious, funny and touching.

As of early 2012, this movie can be streamed from Netflix in a restored version with good color, though the restored version seems to be missing some footage in the mockumentary section that I remember from when I last saw it.",1094860800,2,854,4.972027972027972
661228,5,6303480365,"This is my personal favorite Fellini film. His exercises in cinematic  self-reflexivity and artistic subjectivity are wholly successful here, and  the film is filled with sequences that never fail to inspire curiosity,  amusement, and fascination. While there's no shortage of the grotesque,  eerily dream-like  images that have come to be regarded as  ""Felliniesque"", there is also a great deal of warmth that's  impossible to dislike. If you like this film, you should also watch  ""Roma"", which  similiarly parodies the pretensions of documentary  films within a relatively non-linear framework.
A true classic!",965692800,11,613,5.637362637362638
661229,5,6303480365,"Unless you are a student of clowns then skip this one.  It is centered on interviewing old, out of fashion, European clown stars.  Most are creepy old men that are not amusing and, to be kind, drunks.  It's long, it's  boring.  Not a happy film which was perhaps his intent to show a  counterpoint to a clown's usual image.  He belabours his point.  If you  love the Circus try it.",918086400,2,381,4.328571428571428
7848337,3,6303480365,Is there such a thing as too weird for Fellini? I don't think so...I guess it was just a little too much about clowns. Still worth a watch if you're interested in Fellini's work.,1485907200,,178,4.264705882352941

7848341,5,6303480365,"An all time classic, this essential Fellini documents the European history of circus clowns as a voyage into the director's past, and his unconditional love for clowns. Archival footage of iconic clowns, as well as reenactment of some of the best clown skits in circus lore, combined with Nino Rota's music, make this film one of the best in Fellini's oeuvre.",1447027200,,359,4.901639344262295
7848342,5,6303480365,This is one of my favorite of Fellini's films -- a perfect blend of fantasy and reality in a world populated by aging master clowns who are the subjects of a documentary by Fellini within this fantastical film by Fellini -- illuminating beautifully poignant truths of our sadly humorous predicament.,1436400000,,299,5.0
7848343,5,6303480365,"The documentary starts with the narrator talking about how when he grew up, clowns used to scare him. He traces his memories and even compares them to other people in society, which is funny and keen. But what this movie does is make me feel sad that clowns don't live in the same era as they once did. It's as if we don't need clowns but this movie made me want to revert to more simplistic forms of entertainment. There are few universal languages and music gets most of the attention. Clowns, but namely mimes, communicate in a way that doesn't require sophisticated intrigue. Slapstick may appear violent but it is not esoteric. Some of the clowns would tour hospitals, veterans, and even convents, reminding me of Patch Adams who follows in their footsteps. Clowns can appeal to anyone but the hard thing to understand about happiness and loneliness is that it shows up in the most unexpected places, and when you think you need to do something sophisticated to find happiness it's usually the opposite that you find.",1425686400,,1022,4.715083798882682

THE CLOWNS: Can the circus still entertain? director Fellini muses. The world which it belonged to no longer exists. In an attempt to answer this question, he and a film crew set out on an oddball odyssey across Europe, visiting practitioners of the dying and discredited art of clowning, with its terrifying comic violence. They recreate famous acts of history and view archival films. But everywhere they go, they find the old clowns retired, dying, and forgotten. Depressed and disappointed, The Maestro decides to stage a Clown Funerala literally hysterical affair.

Clowns get a bad rap these days. Im talking clowns like Krusty, Homey and Shakes, you bozos. But the modern clown is as much a degeneration of a centuries-old art form as an architectural Golden Arch is from the Golden Mean. Fellini traces the roots of the original white-faced players and their surreal scenes in a fashion befitting the subject: filmstrips break; people bump into the camera; a dozen crewmembers pour out of the mini-car they drive to an interview, and so on. I have a photo on my office wall of Fellini, the left-hand half of his face made up as a clown, and that photo, Im convinced, is the key to this film. Only someone half genius, half clown, could ever have conceived of and staged the Clown Funerala comically somber procession which rapidly accelerates into the grandest, most elaborate, most exhilarating festival of anarchy ever set on film.

Ecstatic and joyous, yet ending on an appropriately poignant note, this miniature masterpiece is a must-see for all Fellini aficionados, connoisseurs of comedy, and children of all ages. Mark Twain cautioned readers of Huckleberry Finn against looking for a motive or a moral in the story, and Signor Fellini issues his own version of this admonition to modern movie viewers in his answer to a reporters question, What message are you trying to give us here? Any other interpretation pales in comparison. (A note to those who eschew foreign films: So its in Italian? The acts are all pantomime, and slapstick is a universal language. Subtitles are unnecessary.)",1423353600,,2359,4.8925

7848346,3,6303480365,"There is plenty of symbolism for everyone in this movie. At the same time, it was a real chance to see some real clowns in detail. It was as strange as any Fellini movie.",1399334400,,170,4.029411764705882
