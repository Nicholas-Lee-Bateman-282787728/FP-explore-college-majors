8022446,5,B00025HDCQ,"This album was almost as good as Barefoot Servants in every regard.  Not quite, but pretty damn good.  I will play this over and over.  The last track (Beal Street) was like a remastered version of Robert Johnson.  Fabulous vintage number.",1378425600,,239,4.7560975609756095
8022447,5,B00025HDCQ,"I do understand that I'm not supposed to understand everything. But I've never understood why Jon Butcher didn't become a household rock name. From the time Jon Butcher Axis was first released on Polydor in 1983, I was a fan. And I just kept waiting and waiting. But his breakout never came. If you want to know why it should have, buy this CD.",1362096000,3,344,4.390625
8022448,4,B00025HDCQ,"The main drawback to this DVD is the fact that it is culled from a low quality video tape shoot (with attendant low quality sound) from 1984.  That being said, ""Live at the Casbah"" provides a decent doucment of the Jon Buthcer Axis in their heyday (which is especailly welcome for those of us who were too young to get into nightclubs back in 84). As far as the performances, the band is reasonably tight and exhibits excellent muscianship, although Jon sometimes sacrifices precision in his guitar solos for showmanship, but overall his playing and singing are sharp and powerful.  The song selection is solid although I would have preferred more material form ""Stare at the Sun"" and less from ""Along the Axis"" but this is a minor quibble.  I recommend this DVD to anyone who is a Jon Butcher fan.",1088553600,6,798,4.6453900709219855
