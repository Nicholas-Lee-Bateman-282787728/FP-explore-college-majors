It was sorta like a twist of a horror and  comedy flick rolled into one. And the best part is, its meant for teens. I  mean, Most adults won't ever understand this movie. But us, teens can  defianatly relate. I mean that teacher in bio, just HAS to be a psyco! :o)  I'de definetly give this movie more than five stars! If your tired of those  likke deep movies which don't even put a bit of fun in the movie you gotta  see this! I know this reveiw wasn't very informing about what the movie was  about, but that's why you should see them movie!  -love lots- :o)",945993600,6,733,4.148936170212766

Like a lot of guys my age at the time, I watched because the lovely Ms. Holmes was in it. The acting in this movie would have to improve to become mediocre, and I had to turn it off about half-way through.

1253450,4,B00002EQ0I,"It was suppose to be called Killing Mrs. Tingle, but this title sounds way better and more fun. I always thought it was a horror movie, but when i finally watched it, i saw it was a comedy as well. It's a good film. Helen Mirren plays a evil teacher really well and Marisa Coughlan was my fav. student of the main three. A crossbow is the only weapon in the movie and i like all the dialouge. It has some funny moments and some good suspense.",1272844800,,442,4.091954022988506
1253451,5,B00002EQ0I,"The future Mrs. Tom Cruise (Katie Holmes) and future Oscar winner for ""The Queen"" (Hellen Mirren) star in this cute and well-acted teen comedy from writer genius Kevin Williamson who wrote the ""Scream"" franchise and TV's ""Dawson's Creek. The film is about a bunch of small town teenagers who are gearing up for graduation. However, evil school teacher Mrs. Tingle, a hateful, spiteful, and arrogant woman is determined to keep certain students from receiving their diploma because she simply does not like them. It is up to these students to teach Mrs. Tingle a lesson on respect for your fellow human beings, and to bring her down off her high peg and snobbish manners. ""Mrs. Tingle"" is great fun and is mainly geared to a young audience, but all people, despite their age, will enjoy it. The script is well writtem and the performances intelligent and witty. Hellen Mirren steals the movie as the witchly teacher, even though she loses her beautiful British accent for the role. The film is short on bonuses, but the trailer is included. Westwood One says the film is ""outrageously funny!"".",1262908800,,1092,4.876344086021505

1253453,2,B00002EQ0I,"The Bottom Line:

A braindead movie that doesn't bother making its imbecilic plot even slightly plausible (how does Mrs. Tingle go to the bathroom?), Teaching Mrs. Tingle should be thanked for virtually ending the career of Kevin Williamson and never mentioned otherwise",1230336000,,270,5.428571428571429
1253464,4,B00002EQ0I,This movie is truly great and Katie Holmes is at her best. I think that just about every kid in school would love to do what they did and I constantly watch it because it is a very good film in my opinion.,1206921600,,205,3.7906976744186047
1253465,1,B00002EQ0I,"After Lois Duncan was disappointed that her teen suspense novel ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" was turned into a ""teen schlock film"" it was highly doubtful that she'd give permission for film rights to Kevin Williamson again.  So instead he just wrote it in his own words and called it ""Teaching Mrs. Tingle"".  Anyone who read Duncan's novel can see that Williamson just stole her idea.  It's even more obvious that it happened after she was unhappy of HIS treatment of her other novel.  I remember seeing it in the theater so I could do a compare and contrast afterwards.  The movie fails and just shoots for teen eye candy and cheap pop references that wre popular at the time that now look like dusty artifacts!",1205712000,,717,4.5703125
1253466,3,B00002EQ0I,"Ok, so this isn't the greatest movie ever made, but who doesn't want to get back at an old teacher and blackmai them and tie him or her to a bed? Ok, well maybe just in my imagination...

Helen Mirren fabulously plays Mrs. Eve Tingle, a witch of a high school history teacher who loves to belittle her students and she is secretly jealous of them. Her preformance is worth the rental of this alone! She's great!

Katie Holmes playes Leigh Ann a hard-working than your average high school student who gets caught with her teacher's final examine in her bag given to her from her loser crush, Luke (who's is her best friends, Jo Lynn's boyfriend).

Leigh Ann, Luke, and Jo Lynn go to Mrs. Tingle's house to reason with her but things just get out of the hand and things get interesting! The best part of this movie is when Mrs. Tingle is tied to the bed! I love it!

 A must see for any movie buff who likes Helen Mirren and/or teen flicks...",1193529600,,940,4.318181818181818
1253467,5,B00002EQ0I,This is a greatly entertaining movie about the teacher you love to hate ~ with the wonderful and extremely talented Brittish actress Helen Mirren.  It has a surprise ending too ~ to add to your viewing enjoyment.  It is a must see ~ so buy it ~ you will not be disappointed!!!!!!,1159660800,2,279,4.346153846153846
1253468,2,B00002EQ0I,"This teen flick tries to be hip, tries to be suspenseful, and tries to be meaningful but never really attains any of these goals. When three young people kidnap their domineering teacher, the stakes could potentially be huge and traumatic, or just a lot of fun,but the screenwriter pulls back anytime viewers might start to care what happens, or might start to enjoy themselves.

In the Scream films, at any rate, the stakes were huge: Life or Death. In this film, thought they try to make you think the kids academic and career futures are at stake, it never quite rings true. Nor do any of the characters--who are all cliched and unlikeable.  The scariest thing in the film (besides the whole premise) is the facile way they handle teen sex as just a consequenceless, ""fun"" thing. ONe of the characters loses her virginity to a guy her best friend likes and its handled as if she'd eaten the friend's last donut--a little annoying but no big deal. I'm not a prude, but this just seems wrong to me.

Hope they paid Mirren a lot to be in this film because it's a low point in her career as far as I'm concerned. Nothing could be lower in Katie Holmes' career than marrying Tom Cruise, so this may be a high point in her life.",1154736000,2,1225,4.435555555555555
1253469,5,B00002EQ0I,"Like Justin Timberlake, 'Teaching Mrs. Tingle' is a major guilty pleasure.  It's not a great movie, but it's fun, smart and sassy and it has enough going for it to overshadow it's faults.  The story follows Leanne (Holmes) as she struggles to make valedictorian so she can get her scholarship and get out of the small town rut she finds herself.  The only problem is her history teacher Mrs. Tingle (Mirren) who fancies herself at ruining Leanne's life.  When she accuses Leanne of cheating of her history final things spiral out of control and Leanne, along with her boisterous, somewhat ditzy friend Jo Lynn (Coughlin) and the school pretty boy/bad boy Luke (Watson) take matters into their own hands by kidnapping Tingle.  There's just one problem.  What do they do with her now?  The movie is funny and smart and while not perfect it's enjoyable and complete entertainment from start to finish, with true talent like Holmes and Mirren chewing up their lines and Watson and Coughlin looking good while they let the pro's do the work (not to say that Holmes is a 'pro' but I have to admit that she is talented).  I personally find this to be a film I can watch again and again and it always retains its fun factor.",1154476800,2,1216,4.623255813953488
1253470,3,B00002EQ0I,"While attempting to pound out reviews on Straw Dogs and Santa Sangre, a friend of mine lent me Teaching Mrs. Tingle which in comparison felt as light and fluffy as a down comforter. Here I was sweating bullets over two agonizingly lofty and intense pictures that require near perfection before a review could be deemed worthy of appearing in a public arena, and now I had at my fingertips a subject that I could easily discribe in simplistic terms of what works and what does not, needless to say, I decided to give my limited brain cells a rest and leave those two monstrosities in a couple of chaotic piles on the back burner.

Teaching Mrs. Tingle is a comedy that bases its humor on the familiar comedic elements of paying off long running gags, and exaggerating normality. Kattie Holmes has a long running gag about not getting the meaning of the word ""ironic"" right untill the closing moments of the film when she pays off the gag by teaching Mrs. Tingle what irony feels like, not that this gag is particularly funny but it does give the story a conveniently contrived conclusion. Marisa Coughlan's long running gag is that Mrs. Tingle can see right through all her acting attempts which is her characters life ambition, this gag also pays off at the conclusion of the film in a similarly contrived manner when she finally fools Mrs. Tingle with her acting ability. The problem is that this film has long since lost any of its funniness due to several plot twists that end up turning this comedy into a psycho thriller.

The best thing about Teaching Mrs. Tingle is Mrs. Tingle. The stylistic choice to exaggerate her character into the evilest teacher in the history of high schools is by far the most engrossing element in the whole film. Helen Mirren plays Mrs. Tingle, a role that recalls her days as Morgana in John Boormans Excalibur. Like Excalibur she is pretty much playing a mythological character, quite possibly Medusa. Her first introduction to the viewer is from the neck down as she briskly walks through the center of campus hallway in her severely buttoned down dark bussiness suit which looks like the attire of a modern day wicked witch. In a scene reminiscent of the running of the bulls in Pamplona Spain, or the parting of the Red Sea, the students and faculty members alike scatter from her path in total fright in a nice build up her insurmountably evil persona. Later in class she destroys her students ridiculously elaborite assignments and shakey psyches with her razor sharp mind and acid tongue as she floats in front of her students like some manevolent crocodile salivating for the next tender morsel to expose its weakness to her.

Playing the role of a sinister beast as opposed to just another straight person already places Helen Mirren at a huge advantage for stealing the attention away from the rest of the cast, but this disparity is all the more magnified by her incredibly powerful film presence which dwarfs the acting ability of her youthful counterparts. It is also interesting to notice the degree in which she separates herself from her hot young co-stars in the area of sex appeal. This is no small feat concidering that she was 53 during the filming of this movie, and is basicly playing a monster. Yet dispite these character and age drawbacks, and dispite not taking part in the films love triangle she still grossly overpowers her nubile co-stars with her sultry sensuality.

The real problem with this movie is that writer director Kevin Williamson made a poor choice to tie the films best feature to a bedpost and leave her there motionless for most of the film. To fill in the missing action, the story had to slither into its side stories which unfortunately revolve around tedious adolescent dramas. I guess he made a choice to do a humorous parody on the Exorcist, yet this very choice placed the film on an endless downward trajectory, it peters out, flatlines, and once it does it never recovers. It creates an maddening film experiance in that it starts off so promising only to lose all its bubbles and go flat. By the end of the film I no longer felt like I was watching something funny, in fact, while watching two of the principle characters violently tumble down a flight of stairs in slow motion, I was suddenly reminded of my review of Straw Dogs which I placed aside because of the scary feelings it gave me. Somehow I do not associate seeing a painful Peckenpah like action sequence with a fun highschool comedy, and I can't help feeling like Kevin Williamson wanted to do far too much with this idea and in the process made it so that none of it worked.

Ultimately this film might make an okay rentail if you are really really bored and have nothing better that you want to do, but ownership is out of the question, dispite how nice it was to see Helen Mirren play such a dynamic character. In keeping with the theme of irony, the true irony is that the choice to make a comedic Exorcist homage at all cost is ultimately what killed all the fun, now thats ironic.",1148169600,5,5041,4.646860986547085
1253471,3,B00002EQ0I,"Teaching Mrs. Tingle (Kevin Williamson, 1999)

I avoided this film for years despite my fanboyish obsession with Helen Mirren simply because it was written and directed by the awful Kevin Williamson. I finally decided to get around to seeing it, and I discovered, much to my surprise, that Kevin Williamson is not really all that awful. (I am now faced with the idea that Craven and Williamson's collaborations are bad because of Craven and not Williamson, which is a truly depressing idea.) Teaching Mrs. Tingle is at least smart and funny, if predictable and cliched.

Eve Tingle (Mirren) is the history teacher from hell, a tyrant whose class is the one that keeps just about everyone from getting uniformly good grades. Thanks to a series of events that could only happen in Hollywood, good girl Leigh Ann Watson (Dawson's Creek's Katie Holmes) is discovered with the answers to Mrs. Tingle's final exam in her bag. With her best friend Jo Lynn (Pumpkin's Marisa Coughlan) and Luke (Seventh Heaven's Barry Watson), who was responsible for the whole mess in the first place, Leigh Ann goes over to Mrs. Tingle's house to plead her case. Things spiral out of control, and the three teens find themselves locked in a battle of wits with the teacher.

There has been a great deal made over the title's changing from Killing Mrs. Tingle being thanks to Columbine; did no one notice the incredible similarities to the 1997 TV movie Killing Mr. Griffin? Eh, guess not. In any case, you get pretty much what you came for. Jo Lynn is all too stereotypical. Luke is a tad more three-dimensional, but of the three teens, only Leigh Ann is drawn with anything akin to depth. Eve Tingle is the movie's best creation, but much of her depth is shown to the viewer and then made to disappear.

Despite the movie's weak characterization and derivative plot, it is at least amusing and decently-paced, which accounts for some of its watchability. You won't find classic film here, by any means, but not a bad way to kill an hour and a half or so if you enjoy staring rapturously at Helen Mirren. ** ",1147910400,,2085,4.717032967032967
1253472,5,B00002EQ0I,I used to watch this movie as a young girl with my grandmother and the first time i saw it i was floored. i think i watched it 5 times that night and being more and more amazed evertime. Katie Holmes does an incredible job along with Barry Watson who she despises but yet has a secret longing for. The twists and secrets throughout the movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.,1145232000,,381,4.093333333333334
1253473,3,B00002EQ0I,"Helen Mirren is a remarkable actress and it is to her credit that TEACHING MRS. TINGLE works at all.  Writer/director Kevin Williamson, fresh off his DAWSON CREEK and SCREAM successes, decided to try something a little different than another teen slasher movie.  However, the movie's lack of focus:  is it supposed to be funny? scary?, only hurts the overall effect.  Katie Holmes shows promise in her role as the nice girl mistakenly accused of stealing a history exam, and Barry Watson (BOGEYMAN) is charmingly handsome as the hunk she and her best friend desire.  But it is Mirren's deliciously evil turn as the teacher from hell that holds the film together.  The ending is unsatisfying in its abruptness; maybe Williamson should stick with more ""horrifying"" films.",1143763200,,769,5.063492063492063
1253484,4,B00002EQ0I,"At a small town high school one girl has a chance at a scholarship if she can be valedictorian.  If she does, she will be able to escape the town.  The only thing that stands in her way is an evil history teacher.  But when she is almost framed for cheating the history teacher becomes and even bigger obstacle as she seems to thrill in the idea of destroying on of the school's best students.

When an appeal to Mrs. Tingle fails an accident lands them in deeper trouble that results in them holding the teacher in captivity.  But even tied down her evil can spread as she tries to split apart the friends and gain her freedom.  But everything the students do seems to make matters even more hopeless.  But a few lucky breaks might give them a chance against Mrs. Tingle.

A little bit of humor and situations that keep the characters getting deeper and deeper into trouble is only half of what drives this movie.  the other half is Helen Mirren and her portrayal of the evil teacher.  Although I would have liked to have seen more of her evil, it still worked out well.  Not even close to horror, only vaguely comedy, this is a roller coaster teen drama that doesn't stop until the final credits.",1142208000,3,1198,4.4
1253485,4,B00002EQ0I,"I see that there are quite a few negative reviews on this film referencing the acting and plot.  I really don't understand how in depth the plot has to be in order t be entertaining.  Mrs. Tingle is an hateful woman that is jealous of students that may have a future away from the small town.  She didn't get out of the town and she doesn't want anyone else to.  All of the students fear her and most of the faculty steer clear of her whenever they can.  I just love the segments with Mrs. Mirren.  Unfortunately, I hadn't really heard of her prior to this film, but her acting abilities on this film intrigued me so that I had to check out her other films.  She is sensational.

While the other actors in the film are great, it is certainly Mrs. Mirren that steals the show.  I bought the dvd and while it is not a movie that I pull out too often, whenever i do watch it I am always entertained and looking forward to seeing Ms. Tingle in action.  Definitely worth checking out.",1141257600,3,979,4.21505376344086
1253486,5,B00002EQ0I,"Hellen Mirren is just one of the best actresses around and here she puts these untamed, untrained children through their paces without the distraction of a whip and chair.  With the loss of Seigried and Roy I heartily recommend Mrs. Tingle and her wild animal act to replace them.

With all due respect to Roy's injuries and his humanity toward his attacker, Mrs. Tingle's sly, sexy, scintillating savagery is far too much for these adolescent lessers.

If you want to spend an evening watching an old dog teach new tricks with syle and sublety then by all means watch Helen work.  You won't regret it.  You might even feel a tingle of sympathy for her in the end.",1140134400,3,664,4.593220338983051
1253487,4,B00002EQ0I,"I admit that I purchased this movie for the plain and simple fact that Dame Helen Mirren appears in it.  I can also say with all honesty that I have never watched a single episode of Dawson's Creek or 7th Heaven.  I am a huge fan of Mirren's versatile acting abilities. She is amazing in this film, but I won't gush on about her...
However, I was pleasantly pleased and surprised with this film and all of it's actors. It is a well written script by Scream's Kevin Williamson who also shows his ability to direct in his debut.
I also enjoyed several cameo appearances by faces that I haven't seen in a while.  The principal is played by Michael McKean. You knew him as Lenny Koznowski, the nasal, nerdish pal of Andrew ""Squiggy"" Squigman on the hit TV series Laverne and Shirley. Molly Ringwald is Miss Banks, the administrative assistant in the school's office, Vivica A. Fox plays guidance counsellor, Miss Gold and Jeffrey Tambor as Coach ""Spanky"" Wenchell.
The movie moves at a quick pace and has many twists, turns and thrills!  Highly recommended for a family fun movie night!

I'm going to cut to the chase--just how stupid IS our little scholarship hopeful?  She and her friends tie Mrs. Tingle up, and then proceed to believe every single thing she says to them while she's in their control.  Are these kids so emotionally deficient that they'll believe anything said to them by someone who's got nothing to lose by trying to manipulate them?
Now, Mirren does a masterful job with the little she's given to work with--as she handles and reads from Leanne's history project, she gives a look that hints at deeper emotion, but the film never capitalizes on it.  The flat script never gives Tingle any dimension:  a story she tells about her past is just another manipulative lie.  Everything that comes out of her mouth is a lie, but there's no sense of the greater truth behind the lie--she's intensely bitter for no reason at all.
Sure, the kids splash reasons for her bitterness at her, but they fall like rain off an umbrella, leaving no hint that they've actually reached Mrs. Tingle.

I am shocked and outraged at the academy awards for not only forgetting to nominate barry, but just not outright giving him the award for best (and needless to say, sexiest) actor.
The only drawback to the movie is that it neglects to list all the pertinent facts and tidbits on barry's personal life - like does he enjoy surfing?  and if so, where does he like to surf?

1253508,5,B00002EQ0I,"A reviewer who gave this movie a one star rating suggested that Teaching Mrs Tingle is an Unearthly movie.
I'll have to disagree with this opinion wholeheartedly. This movie has more earthliness than 7 other movies I've watched:
ET
Star Wars
Return of the Jedi
Empire Strikes Back
Planet of the Apes
And a couple Star Trek movies
Be that as it may, I don't think Mrs. Tingle was trying to convey Earthliness to its audience. If I may speak for the director and writer for just a moment, I have a feeling that this movie was supposed to be viewed for the purpose of entertainment. While you're watching it, try not to make this COMEDY into a statement of the American Youth of today and the direction our public schools are going. Instead, watch it as a comedy. Some movies, like this one and Scream and even American Pie, are to be enjoyed instead of being put under the scope. Put Citizen Kane under the scope. If you want a funny movie with funny dialogue and a great, unexpected ending...one of those movies that you can watch over and over and over again...then watch this movie. If you're looking for a commentary on the American Youth of today, then get your commentary from something other than a movie that's intended to be a comedy.

To tell you the truth, this movie isn't as bad as has been written about it. Writer Kevin Williamson is on board as director as well on this film. Three students decide to take action against a nasty teacher(brilliantly played By Helen Mirren)who thinks they were cheating on a test(which they weren't)and now stands in their way of graduating. They go to her house and a series of incidents occur which now has the three students keeping Mrs. Tingle locked up in her house, with each one of them taking turns watching her. One by one, Mrs. Tingle begins to mess with their minds. Helen Mirren is exceptionally convincing and brilliant as the nasty teacher. She will have you hooked on her through the entire film. The other stars, Katie(Dawson's Creek)Holmes, Barry(7th Heaven)Watson, and newcomer Marissa Coughlan are all pretty good. Coughlan is especially delightful. Many bad things were said about this film because of Columbine and the violence in the movie, but there is no deaths. No nothing. I think a lot of people ripped into it because of what the original title was and because of Columbine. It's obvious that they never even saw the film or read the script. It's PG-13 after all. This isn't grand filmmaking, but it's entertaining to a certain degree nonetheless. Williamson has a nice eye for directing as well. The film was loosely based on Williamson's own bad teacher.

1253526,1,B00002EQ0I,"Ah, what better way to relax on a dull, damp Saturday night than to watch a good, mindless teen slasher flick? Let's just say that 15 minutes into this disgustingly lazy conundrum of week-old tripe, licking around the base of a toilet seemed like a fun, relaxing diversion. Oi vey. It starts out innocently enough. Katie Holmes is Leighann, a hardworking and wholesome high school senior who needs a scholarship to attend college. The only class that stands in her way is history with Mrs. Tingle, in which she needs an A to be on top of her class. We meet her just as she finishes her history presentation project, a stunning replica of a diary that might've been kept by an accused witch during the Salem witch hunts.  Helen Mirren is Mrs. Tingle, who is just poorly scripted and overwrought from the beginning. We meet her as she stridently plows down the hall and students clear the way in melodramatic fright. She intimidates the principal before marching into her classroom to witness her students' presentations. Holmes gives a very good, sincere delivery concerning her mock journal, which, unbelievably, is ostracized by Mirren. Also important later on is another student's project, a crossbow, (which provides an inane and gape-worthy scene where the presenter idiotically loads the thing and - surprise, surprise - it nearly hits someone (Holmes' overdone rival for the scholarship) and the pretty boy slacker played by Barry Watson. Well, Holmes meets with her saucy aspiring actress pal, played by Marisa Coughlin, after school in the gymnasium to complain about the injustice of it all. Watson, lust object of Coughlin, saunters in with a little present for Holmes - a copy of Mirren's final exam. Nonplussed, Holmes tries to repudiate Watson's offering, but he tosses it to her and she is ultimately caught by a smirking, adolescently jubilant Mirren who just can't wait to rake this little upstart over the coals. Holmes pleads all the way to the office and gets off easy for the time being as the principal has conveniently retired for the afternoon. Anxious, she commences with Watson and Coughlin, who agree that Mirren must be sated. Plan A: Reason with Mirren and reinforce that Holmes, indeed,is innocent. This fails miserably and the three end up in Mirren's spooky old house, threatening the old hag desperately with - get this - the crossbow. Before you know it, she is tied to her bed and mayhem ensues.  Now Mirren has quite a wizened, stagey disposition as Mrs. Tingle. She often alludes dramatically to plays and other movies - the works and characters of Shakespeare, in particular - and used this prima-donna streak to (successfully!) manipulate Holmes and Coughlin (the latter, especially, must be mildly mentally retarded). Crazy stuff happens: Mirren convinces Holmes that she will never be successful with men; Holmes immediately ups and offers herself to Watson, whom Coughlin is lusting after, very zealously (we even get the ol' cut-to-the-hearth snip to replace the dirty details while lamely conoting that this is hot, sticky, passionate sex). Mirren's clandestine boy-toy, the phys-ed teacher, saunters by and the teens turn this possible disaster into a plan to blackmail Mirren by getting ""Spanky"" drunk on wine and dragging him into bed with Mirren for a little photo shoot. No can do. As the movie creaks and groans on, what little plot there was to start with is reduced to embarassingly nebulous proportions. Holmes alters the marks in Mirren's gradebook. Meanwhile, Mirren turns Coughlin against Holmes for the romp with Watson. The teens take care to deliver the gradebook to the guidance office from whence the grades are posted, revealing Holmes' ""A"" in history and her position on top of the class. Her opponent is incensed and incredulous. Meanwhile, we learn that Mirren has gotten loose and has called the school to report the phony grades. Holmes believes that Coughlin has ratted until she learns the truth and races to Mirren's house. In a lame action sequence which is reminiscent of Homer strangling Bart on the Simpsons, Mirren strangles Holmes and the two bang each other up and down the stairs. Mirren finds the crossbow and shoots at Holmes as she darts out the door only to hit Holmes' rival who has come to protest her grade. And she gets caught. And the rival isn't really dead, see, because just as in the first scene when she is nearly hit with the arrow, she uses her yearbook as a shield. And Holmes gets the scholarship. WTF??? The holes in this plot are so numerous it's hard to even know where to begin listing them. First off, how does Watson snag the crossbow? It wasn't his project and we don't see him drag it home from school. We are shown all of the projects perched on a table in Mirren's house, graded, so she had obviously taken them home after school. Only a couple more days are left in the school year when Holmes completes her project. If she has been taught by Mirren all year long and is aware that Mirren dislikes her, why does she feel that that will change with her journal project? Mirren's Tingle is not a reasonable woman. Holmes is caught altering the grades, yet this is disregarded at the end and she gets the scholarship - even though she's NOT truly on top of her class. Not to mention the stolen test! The plot seems to contort itself at the will of the script. There are several truly irrelevant parts, such as Coughlin's regaling the bound Mirren with her Exorcist mockery. In all, this is just plain lazy filmmaking. I believe that Williamson sought to mimic the campiness of '80s teen flicks here, and this, like many of the worst of that genre, may go down in cheesy crappola history - a movie that won't be ""hip"" until 20 years later when sleepover bound 12 year olds rent it for a laugh. Williamson is insulting us by assuming that his cute-as-a-button teen cast will suffice for the lack of all other substance here. This movie, in conclusion, is about as exciting and suspenseful as watching a digital clock and seeing if 7:29 will follow 7:28. Avoid at all costs.",973641600,9,6074,4.811483253588516

My only real problem with this movie is the ending. Too many issues  are glossed over for a happy, neatly packaged conclusion. The kids may have  hated Mrs. Tingle for she was no doubt a bitter old lady, but the kids did  indeed have a stolen test paper. What was Mrs. Tingle to do? Ignore that  completely?

My only memorable problem with the film is  that there was just one too many resurrections where a character looks  dead, stays still for a moment, then gets up and the movie continues. This  comes not from a perspective of hunger for violence, but credibility is  pushed just a bit too far, even for a movie.

1253535,2,B00002EQ0I,"The basic plot for ""Teaching Mrs. Tingle"" follows several high school students; very intelligent Leigh Ann Watson(Katie holmes) is caught with the answer's to the finals, given to her by Luke Churner(Barry  Watson)and Jo lynn(Marisa Coughlin ). With a prize schoolar ship at risk,  Katie attempts to prove that she is innocent of the crime. Mrs. Tingle will  have none of this, as it is blatantly obvious that she is, above all, pure  evil. One event leads to another, and our precious students tie Tingle to  her bed and slowly force her to listen to them, while Tingle is slowly  pyschologicly tearing the group apart, planning her  freedom..............
Simply by a glance at the cover of the film and it  becomes apparent that ""Teaching Mrs. Tingle"" is targeted toward  teens. Add the fact that it is directed by (ugh) Kevin willimason and  features such popular teen stars; adults might dislike this film. The  various reasons why this movie was passible are;
1) Was it entirely  nessessary to shoot Tingle with a cross-bow? Would it not be smarter to  reason with the principal or someone else that has communicated with Mrs.  Tingle, as everyone who knows her hates her?
2) Helen Mirren gives off a  fantastic preformance as the evil teacher, but her physical strengh is  unbeleviable. She punches, crushes, and strangles all the students who get  in her way.
3) Helen Mirren stays tied to the bed post for the entire  movie.
4) The students are so dim that they acually confide their  personal secrets to Tingle, and she uses the information to manipulate  them.
5) The use of the word ""Ironic"".
6) The plot is  somewhat weak, mostly involving the students madely scrambling to keep the  kidnapping secret; just add a little weak humor, sex, and violence.
7) At  one point Tingle is smashing a certain student around, spaltering them is  blood. Tingle acually gets pushed down the stairs and all of the blood  dissapears. I doubt that one is healed from falling down stairs...
8) The  ending. Holmes sleeps with Watson, who is Coughlin's crush. This breaks the  bond of friendship between Holmes and Coughlin, yet the group are seen  walking together during ther ending, in a cheery sort of mood. WhAt?
9)  Bad lines. ""Why are you doing this to us?"" ""I want you to  learn!"" ""No, you want me to fail"". Bravo.
There are  positive points however; Marisa Coughlin depiction of the excorist must be  seen to believe, Coughlin herself gives of a charming preformance, and the  entire film manages is not to boring.

I wish he stuck with the original script, it was  so much better then the one he used.  The part that was so lame was when  the coach would sing ""like a virgin""  Just for that, I had to  knock off 2 stars.  Another lame character was the ""smart girl""  (leigh ann's rival.  She dies in the original script). My favorite lines  are from the scene right before Leigh Ann gives in to the handsome Barry  Watson.  Mrs. Tingle says:
""Who are you fooling?  You're so scared I  can smell it.  Your fear is the most predictable thing about you.  You've  lived your whole life in fear.  Terrified to make a mistake.  Scared to  death that you won't get that ""A"".  Or that scholoarship--or that  ticket out.  That you'll never escape your mother and her name tag.  Or  that father that won't return your calls.  That's why you never let the boys  touch your virginal body.  You're afraid of getting that bad seed.  Afraid  of giving birth to a child you never wanted.  A child you could only blame  for your own wretched existence.  Stuck in a small town with a small life.  Destined to become what yo despise the most.  I know all about it, Leigh  Ann.  I wrote the book.  I KNOW YOU.""

It doesn't work as a horror or suspense movie, but Helen Mirren's over the top performance makes it almost work as a black comedy. Katie Holmes has  talent, and has made some good movies (The Ice Storm, Go) but needs to make  better career decisions. Helen Mirren is too good an actress for this role,  but she ultimately saves the movie. Other than Mirren's performance and a  good 'Exorcist' impression by Marisa Coughlan the movie features not much  else. From a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 4!",956534400,,562,4.470588235294118

It fails as a comedy, as a suspense thriller and as a horror movie. It almost  succeeds as science fiction. The direction is uninspired and Katie Holmes,  cute cherub face that she is, should be modeling teen clothing, not acting.  The only thing that keeps this movie from being a 1 out of 10 is Helen  Mirren. Her performance is fabulously nefarious and is (almost) worth  suffering through the rest of it. Her ability to transmute from imperious  to faux sympathetic to deviously manipulate and control her prey shows  masterful range.

I do not know any of the younger actors and actresses in this  movie (Ms. Holmes, Ms. Coughlin and Mr. Watson), but I was pleasantly  surprised with their excellent acting.  However, the real star was Ms.  Mirren and she was fantastic in her role.
On the other hand, I was  unpleasantly surprised with the harsh critics.  Let's face it, this movie  may not be nominated for Oscar's, but it does have high entertainment value  for 20 dollars.  Three good looking young performers, Ms. Mirren in her  role, an interesting plot, plus good picture and sound quality.  What else  do you expect?

I've loved all the scripts Kevin Williamson has wrote, from Scream to the faculty, and not forgeting Dawson's Creek which I also enjoy a watch of. This fillm was also Williamson's directorial debut, and included the very talented Katie  Holmes.
So, to be honest I was probably looking for a lot from this  movie, did it deliver? Well to be honest its probably unfair to say if it  did, or didn't. To me it just could have been a Dawson's Creek episode(ok,  maybe if it had been toned down a bit). Holmes was excellent and stole the  show, but te film was slow, and never really peaked.

I have great respect for Kevin Willamson, (Dawson's  anyone?) but this directing and script! I would have thought it came from a  12 year old had i not seen the credits! There were some very good parts in  it, and i disagree with alot of these reviewers, saying that the ending was  not bad (Predicable? Yes. Boring? Yes. Dumb? Yes. But BAD? Not really) The  phycological twists in it were great, and the overall charecter of Mrs.  Tingle, a munipulative, phycotic, teacher from hell is a refreshing change  from a killer weilding a weapon.

1253562,5,B00002EQ0I,"Helen Mirren definitely steals the show in this film, but her performance is a gem properly set by her supporting cast.  Mrs. Tingle is the teacher (the fortunate among us only had one) we all hated in high school--a  bitter, arrogant, pedantic horror who hated the students entrusted to her  care.  She delights not in teaching but in assuring the students that they  are hopelessly ignorant and far, far beneath her.  She is equally hateful  to adults who don't immediately fall in sync with her plans, as when she  blackmails the principal of the school by reminding him that she knows he  is a four-year veteran of Alcoholics Anonymous.  Mirren makes you hate her  character most sincerely in her very first scenes in the movie and gives  you more and more reasons to do so as the film progresses.  She is the most  deliciously evil villian to appear on film in years.  The young actors in  the film rise to the occasion admirably, as well.  At times Coughlin's  performance comes dangerously close to being too campy, but overall it is  completely consistent with another character you probably knew in high  school--the member of the dramatics club who knew she was destined to be a  big star before she ever auditioned for a professional director.  It is she  who encourages the trio of students to persist with the drama of keeping  Ms. Tingle hostage while attempting to persuade her to ""listen to  reason"".
The main characters might have become broad-stroke  caricatures without the deft writing and direction that gives them a truly  human side.  Mirren is wicked, but you have to admire her intelligence and  craftiness.  Holmes is wholesome and innocent as charged, but not so  innocent that she can't participate in a hostage-taking plot to achieve her  goals nor too wholesome to continue refusing Watson's romantic advances.  Coughlin shows the cunning and instinctive intelligence that can often be  hidden by the facade of an ""airhead blonde"".  Watson shows that  the high school rebel, with or without a cause, can do great, if illegal,  things once given a sense of direction--making you think that pointing such  youth in the right direction might not be a waste of time, after all.
The  real fun of this movie is the building suspense as Tingle and her students  play a war of wits and nerve.  Mirren is truly amazing as she controls  minds and action while helplessly (?) tied to her bedposts throughout most  of the film.  Further, you can enjoy the suspense, which becomes quite  nerve-racking at times, because there is no real gore and violence to spoil  the fun--some hand-to-hand combat, yes, with normal resulting wounds, but  nothing that  exposes internal organs or even results in blood splatter.  And in the finest tradition of good suspense films, just when your nerves  can't take any more of the sinister stuff, there are moments of comic  relief that are just as tasty.  Kevin Williamson is to be highly commended  for his skillful direction of this treat.
This film has some capital  performances, the sort that take you back to the good old days when  successful suspense films relied on the talent of actors and a good  director rather than exclusively on gore, crash scenes and special effects.  Nice to know it can still be done.  We have missed it.",950832000,5,3292,4.828828828828829

The only redeption I found in this film was the scene between  Katie and Mrs. Tingle confronting their truths.  Without batting an eye,  Mrs. Tingle tells Katie of her total disdain with today's youth.  How  spoiled and angry they are, yadda yadda yadda.  Katie looks on  dumbfoundedly, oblivious to her dismay.  But a remarkable budding of the  heads between the two.

It's not Helen Mirren's fault, because she holds this film up on her own - it's just  that what should be a dark and twisted story about pupils' hate for their  teachers is in fact a rather dull farce. The characters are unbelievably  one dimensional, especially for such a gifted writer as Williamson. The  kids are holding their techer hostage, yet minutes later they're having sex  in her house - forgetting that they're most likely going to go to jail. I  really wanted to like this film, but having got used to the best from  Kevin, this just won't do. There's only a trailer on the disc, probably  because the people involved were a little embarassed at being in it and so  don't want to be reminded of that fact, but the sound is good - at times it  seems like it really is raining outside your own house during a pivotal  scene between Mirren and Holmes.

Helen Mirren is the perfect Mrs. Tingle; she has that look that can see through your sole and divulge your deepest fears. That same year she played Ayn Rand in Passion of Ayn Rand, The (1999). However most people remember her as Supt. Jane Tennison in ""Prime Suspect.""

Michael McKean made a perfect principal and you can tell he was sweating on his early encounter with Mrs. Tingle. Remember him in ""Laverne & Shirley"" (1976) TV Series as Lenny Kosnowski (1976-1982)?

Then there is the quick appearance of Molly Ringwald as Miss Banks. She brings back memories of ""Sixteen Candles"" (1984), when she was the teenager.

If this movie looks predictable or the people's thoughts are transparent, that is the design. Now the viewer can say don't do that or oh no will they really do that? And you can see eyes narrow as the mind is plotting!
