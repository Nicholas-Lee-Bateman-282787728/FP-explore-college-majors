8496719,4,B006DHAT3M,"I haven't seen this picture in over thirty years. It wasn't exactly how I remembered it, but I thoroughly enjoyed it like I did before. It's an obscure film, but I was happy to see it was still available.",1431993600,,204,4.256410256410256
8496720,4,B006DHAT3M,As the movie was in the English dialogue and there was no subtitles it was very hard to follow the story.,1412121600,,105,4.0476190476190474
8496721,3,B006DHAT3M,"Was keen to see this film, as I was in it. Unhappily the dvd was unplayable on either Pal or NSTC: so dvd as it stood was useless. Luckily I found someone to unravel it....am totally inept with machines....so I have a reasonably OK viewable copy. It seems to me that , if you are to advertise in UK dvds unplayable in UK, that should be made absolutely plain in the
advertisement.",1341360000,,380,4.291666666666667
