8682858,4,B00O9ZSHUM,"I have spent much of my career working in public health.  As an infectious disease person, I have to say this is one of the better documentaries that I have seen.  It would definitely be useful for training epidemiology students in public health and generating understanding amongst lay people.  There are relatively few things I would change.  This outbreak has been a moving target since the beginning so considering that, I would recommend this video.",1421193600,5,454,5.013333333333334
