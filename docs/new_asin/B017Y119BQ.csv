7537530,4,B017Y119BQ,"""By The Sea"" (2015 release; 122 min.) brings the story of married couple Roland (played by Brad Pitt) and Vanessa (played by Angelina Jolie). As the move opens, we see them driving in a gorgeous 1960s Citroen convertible somewhere in the south of France, while Jane Birkin's ""Jane B"" is blasting on the radio. Roland and Vanessa find an agreeable spot close by the sea and decide to stay there. Eventually another married couple (some years younger, though) ends up in the hotel room next to Vanessa and Roland, not aware that Vanessa found a peep hole, allowing them to look in the other room. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the third movie in the last 3 years directed by Angelina Jolie (she also wrote the script and is the producer), but the first one where she directs herself (and Brad). It's been exactly 10 years since Angelina and Brad last co-starred, in ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" (ironically also a struggling marriage, but of a very different kind!). If it sounds from my introductory lines that a lot is happening in the movie, think again. This is an ultra-slow moving film. You would think that this would allow us to get to know these characters, but alas, that is not the case either. We know virtually nothing as to why the marriage is in trouble, and can only speculate why Vanessa seems depressed, if not worse, and why Roland is experiencing writer's block. Despite all that, the movie does find traction in the second half, just in the nick of time, frankly. The movie's photography is drop-dead gorgeous (filmed in Malta, that stood in as the south of France). The movie features a number of big French movie stars, including Melvil Poupaud and the beautiful Melanie Laurent (as the other married couple) and Niels Arestrup (as the caf&eacute; tender). There is a ton of great music featured in the movie, both in the musical score, as well as French songs from that era (think Serge Gainsbourg, Jane Birkin, Jacques Dutronc, Sheila, etc.).

""By The Sea"" opened late November at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and since I didn't expect this to play in theaters very long, I went to see it right away. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended dismally (4 people, including myself). I can't say it surprised me as the vibe around this movie has not been great. I nevertheless was curious about it (due to a clever trailer, frankly). If you are interested in catching a slow-moving relationship drama that is way off-center yet strangely appealing in the movie's second half, I encourage you this give this a try, be it on Amazon Instant Video or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1450828800,50,2731,4.6875

7537534,5,B017Y119BQ,"This movie is such a juxtaposition of a beautiful place and two extremely hurting characters who seem to be trying like hell to make amends. I was going to compare this brilliantly written, filmed and acted movie to Hemingway's short story, ""The Sea Change"", only because it's just a shade closer to that sense of betrayal and the mood of it so close. Yes, that's an altogether completely different story, I know. Just that the mood evoked here by the couple reminds me a bit of that, as well as Hemingway's ""Garden of Eden,"" only THAT TOO is NOT this story. This story takes it's time to unravel and show it's true self. It is a work of art.

Such a gorgeous set and scenery. And the slow even paced timing as well is very European.

What one clearly sees that will stand the test of time is a great insurmountable love between two people and that cannot be erased. This is so difficult to watch because you can see the absolute and fierce love Brad Pitt has for Angelina Jolie. You just don't find that kind of love anymore.

My heart goes out to this family, and I hope Ms. Jolie knows what an amazing film maker she has become. An outstanding movie by two of the world's finest Actors. Grazie a Bellisima!",1493510400,,1209,4.388392857142857
7537535,1,B017Y119BQ,"I expected more from this movie because I like Pitt and Jolie but had to force myself to finish watching in hopes that the lifeless performances, particularly by Joli, were headed someplace. To me, too much of the movie became focused on the hole in the wall between their room at an old French hotel and that of a newly wed couple, discovered first by Jolie, then by Pitt. We see scene after scene of Jolie, then Pitt and Joli, watching the couple in states of undress and in various sexual positions which finally inspires Jolie to move far enough out of her wooden depressed state to allow her husband to kiss her and make love with her. What's confusing is that after that first step towards letting him back into her life, she goes to the room next door when the newly wed man is alone and Pitt looks through the hole seeing him begin to undress her and bursts in to stop it. The point of her attempted seduction? No clue except to create a rift between the couple. Pitt tries to explain to the angry, broken hearted wife that there was a deeper reason for what his wfe did but his explanation doesn't justify it to me. Jolie tries to come across as moody, depressed but only suceeds in appearing angry and selfish. The owner of the bar/eatery put in the best performance in the movie in his interactions with Pitt and the descriptions of his wife whom he treasured who died earlier.",1491782400,,1388,4.42578125

7537539,1,B017Y119BQ,Awful. Absolutely awful. Written and directed by Jolie and it's realllly obvious. The only redeeming quality of the film is the scenery. I actually felt bad for Pitt. I'd be embarrassed if I were him. I actually found myself thinking that this must be what life with her is like. She is grotesque looking. Sick film.,1485475200,,316,4.660714285714286
7537540,3,B017Y119BQ,"I wanted to love this, but couldn't. It's visually stunning. The background is so beautiful that it becomes distractingly foreground - particularly because the movie is really slow and not much is happening otherwise.

The story is also overshadowed by Jolie and Pitt. I wanted to see the characters, but only saw them. I kept looking for the chemistry that flew off the screen in Mr. and Mrs. Smith and played out in the tabloids in real life. It's not here. They don't have any chemistry at all. The dialog tells the story, not the acting.

The pacing is off. You're into the last half hour when something finally happens. I ducked out halfway through and almost didn't finish it. It's then that I realize that Vanessa (Jolie) is depressed and not just cold. Had we opened with that, I might have been more invested from the beginning. When you finally know why she's depressed, her actions still don't make sense. Neither do Melvil's.

Pitt gave a great performance. You can see his struggle, pain, love, and devotion. I was really surprised by this because those are not the types of roles he usually goes for or does well. That's where AJ shines.

Overall the film plays as voyeuristic and self-conscious. It's a bit like watching paint dry by a beautiful sea. I SUSPECT that this it the type of movie that deepens with a second viewing. I may try it again later and change the rating if I am right. The first viewing was not spectacular though.",1484784000,,1450,4.608527131782946

I knew that this movie would be more artistic without much action - which is how it turned out, however, if you watch it, you'll understand why it is so mellow. This movie has great writing and a heart-wrenching ending. I think that this is a nice movie with beautiful scenery (not to mention Angelina). :) If you don't like tragedies, then this movie is NOT for you. But, if you like the occasional depressing, real life situation where a couple has to either fight through their pain, or become lost, then this is a good choice.",1483833600,4,592,4.4907407407407405

similarities in the two films....two ""real life actor couples"" playing ""troubled people in a marriage"" who draws in/""uses"" another couple to bounce off their issues with.  The passion level of this is about 10% of that other powerful film.  It seems Angelina was making a film about her own life...
trying to somehow draw Brad back in with subtle (or not too subtle) manipulation.  Frankly, I can see how they drifted apart after watching this.
  I have been to Malta for a few weeks but didn't remember it being so pretty.  This movie was showing pretty people doing ""not so pretty things"" to one another and those around them.  Angelina appeared neurotic, Brad seemed confused, and the story line ambled along in odd zigzags.
This film is  more visually memorable than anything else.  I often say a book should have been a magazine article. In this case, I feel the movie
should have been a 30 minute 'short"".  The film, more than anything, lacked heart.",1481500800,,1101,4.772486772486772

You wade through all this silent crap to find out she had 2 miscarriages all that for this 2 hour non stop nothing?

7537557,4,B017Y119BQ,"A rather naked look at marriage. A woman has gone from confident to self-doubt. She's always depended on her self image as temptress. Now her emphasis on herself as perfect fertility goddess on earth has come crashing down. Her husband is willing to accept her but she is too proud to allow it. She needs to see herself as perfect even if he wants to accept the imperfections. She needs the ignorance of another man who is unaware of her failures. She's unready for reality, prefers to hide behind the illusion rather than live with the truth. Her husband simply wants to love her flaws and all but she won't allow it. She's too busy beating herself up destroying her self-esteem then needing to repair it by taking another man from his wife to prove her sexuality is more powerful than the other woman's love and fertility. It's more like Gia or Girl, Interrupted than later films. You get a bird's eye view of just how traumatic the loss of breasts and ovaries can be. Of how willingness to accept someone just isn't enough when they can't accept themselves. You do get some powerful insight from the movie about just exactly why a woman who has lost her ovaries might try all too hard and counterproductively to prove to the world that she's the world's best mother. It's maybe not the best movie objectively but it certainly is a brave movie. Even to the musings by the husband who all but states the movie is a thinly veiled autobiography about a marriage destroying itself. It's hard not to hurt for the couple as shallow, selfish, screwed up and destructive as they are. Especially when you realize it's mostly insecurity and inability to cope that drives the destructive behavior. It's Hamlet and Ophelia after ten years. To self-destruct or not to self-destuct. There's something rotten in the state of matrimony.",1474761600,5,1822,4.714733542319749

7537575,2,B017Y119BQ,"Angelina Jolie has now added her hubby, Brad Pitts surname to hers but for simplicity Ill stick with Jolie.  After what I thought was a terrific and underappreciated film called Unbroken from 2014, Jolie goes for a Euro-art styled relationship film.  Jolie and Pitt (Inglourious Basterds) play Vanessa and Roland, a childless couple married for 14 years.  Set in the early 70s from what I could tell, they roll up to a pristine French seaside village in an equally pristine silver Citroen convertible.  Impeccably dressed they take a beautiful room overlooking the sea.  The ground floor of the villa/hotel contains a small bar and restaurant where they meet Michel (Niels Arestrup, War Horse) a recent widower who still thinks romantically about his wife.  He becomes the films conscience.  The film is filled with these contradictions in marriage.

Vanessa and Roland barely speak to each other and when they do the air is filled with distain.  It is clear something is amiss.  Rather than arguing, they essentially dismiss each other.  Vanessa is popping pills along with her wine, remaining in her room.  Roland, a novelist, is trying unsuccessfully to get inspiration.  Hard to do when he starts pounding down gin for breakfast.  So for most of the film, were left guessing as to what the problem is that led them to this angst.  Infidelity?  Loss of a child?  Rape?  They don't talk about it.

One day Vanessa discovers a peep hole located near the floor which goes into the room next door.  When newlyweds Francois (Melvil Poupaud, Face Down) and Lea (Melanie Laurent, also Inglourious Basterds) move in next door, Vanessa and later Roland watch as the young couple have sex, sometimes playful, sometimes romantic.  Roland, perhaps looking for a stimulus for the frigid Vanessa even encourages couples leering.

Unfortunately this movie is boring as hell.  Its running time is 122 minutes which is about 120 minutes too long.  I don't have a problem with the concept, the actors and certainly not the sets and scenery.  In fact, the technical aspects of the movie are terrific, thus the 2 star review.  The script, also by Jolie, isn't moving nor does it seem to move the story.  What we are left with is 2 very unlikeable people, mostly holed up in their hotel room and forcing us to sit through their misery with them.  No thanks.",1470182400,3,2339,4.868020304568528

7537579,5,B017Y119BQ,"I love love love this movie!

I wasn't sure how I would handle a ""slow"" movie, because I have to be in a certain mood to watch those kinds of movies, but I do not regret my purchase.

In general terms, the film is about a married couple who are at an impasse in their relationship--they've been together for fourteen years--and decide to go on a vacation to see if they can fix it. While at their resort ""by the sea"" in France, they meet and become friendly with another couple, and a barkeep. The barkeep represents a relationship that has already come and gone--his wife is dead, and the other couple are themselves, fourteen years ago i.e. newlyweds. They are in the middle......past the bloom of a new relationship, but not to the point to where they have spent an entire lifetime together.

There is more to the story, and be warned, the characters are not supposed to be likeable towards anyone BUT each other. Which makes them perfect matches. Destined to be together (like Brad and Angelina, lol, which makes sense since she wrote and directed this film). I have watched the film twice, and this is definitely a movie that requires multiple viewings, because the second time I watched it, I noticed more character motivations in the film, that I hadn't before.

I really like the overall message of the film--to me it is saying that when you are in a relationship that has hit the rocks, what will fix it is acknowledging what went wrong, and adjusting to it. You cannot go back to the way you were, when you first met that other person, because so much has changed. It's accepting that change, and moving forward--that's what keeps the relationship together.",1469145600,25,1667,4.621621621621622
7537580,5,B017Y119BQ,"This is a beautiful film about the realities of marriage, set during a vacation in the idyllic French seaside.  The characters artfully examine the depth of a long-term relationship, from recollection of a passionate beginning to the middle doldrums exacerbated by trauma and a constant threat of possible end.  Jolie and Pitt were incredibly brave to do this project together as real-life husband and wife.",1469145600,2,407,5.246153846153846
7537581,3,B017Y119BQ,"Angelina Jolie is typically explosive on the silver screen.  This is why she's had a long running career that has propelled her into super stardom as an actor. This electricity she conveys in all of her characters is missing in this film.  Yeah, she's beautiful to look at, but she merely moves from room to room bored out of her mind.

Angelina Jolie wrote and directed, ""By the Sea"".  She proved in her previous two directed movies that she could transition behind the camera in ""Unbroken"" and ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"", but doesn't quite hit it in her third directed movie.  It's the Directors job to push the actors performance to give what they are capable of, but in this case she wasn't able to push herself as an actor since she was also wearing the directors hat.  Other director/actors who have had to direct themselves have admitted the great challenges that come with that.  They realized they need the director to push their performance.  It doesn't help matters that not much happens in this two hour aesthetically pleasing to the eye candy of a movie.  ""By the Sea"" suffers from a slow sleepy pace that doesn't start to pick up until it's over, and by then who will care?

Brad Pitt fairs a bit better with what he's been given to worth with.  This is not a bad movie, just a slow one where not much happens.  The characters are not that likable or interesting.  What makes this watchable is that you're watching Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.  Two actors with a long impressive list of film credits.  In ""By the Sea"", they play a married couple of fourteen years who decide to take resident in a gorgeous tiny seaside town in the south of France (this was actually filmed in Malta and the island of Goza).  The two lead characters seem to be civil, distant, and cordial with one another as if bored by the relationship and their lives.  He drinks and she pops pills.  You don't really know what the problem seems to be and won't know until much later in the film.  He seems more willing to connect with his wife and come together, but she puts up stubborn resistance turned off by it for reasons unknown.  Maybe just the wear and tear of being together with the same person for so long, and they're no longer able to passionately connect.  This is what I figured until it's finally revealed that its much more serious than that.

They couple find one thing in common and that is mutually spying on the neighbor couple next door through a peep hole in the wall from their unit to the couple next door.  They take turns spying on the couple who pretty much always seem to be making love or having sex.  They eventually spy on the couple together bringing their wine and their meals to play voyeur.  This happens an hour into the film and that seems to bond the Angelina and Brad characters together.  This is about when the movie picks up a bit, but for some that might too late.

The scenery is beautiful and Angelina has a keen eye on where to point the camera.  What fails is the story is pretty bland and chugs along very sleepily.  It's got a nice independent European foreign film touch to it going as far to having the cast speak in French with subtitles in many of the scenes, including with the two leads.

""By the Sea"" has a beautiful backdrop, beautiful clothes, beautiful sets, beautiful actors, but the story could have matched that beauty.  No doubt Angelina Jolie was able to get this picture green lit under the Universal Pictures logo just by her name alone.  I wonder if the studio even bothered to read the initial script.  Brad Pitts name would further excite any studio head to green light this film quickly even without seeing a script as well too.  This was co-produced by both actors production companies.  Had this script been shopped around by an unknown screenwriter, then it might never have been made.  The movie cost 10 million and made 3 million worldwide, so having these two incredible screen beauty's wasn't enough to get the public to flock to the theaters to see it.  Ultimately what did I think of this?  It was alright.  The film should've started half way through.",1469145600,6,4123,4.52027027027027

7537583,3,B017Y119BQ,"Several reviewers complained that the movie was boring. How could this movie, I wondered, created by the famous married couple, who often grace the screen with their radiant performances, who are known for their generosity in helping the needy in Africa and Asia, who adopted children and gave birth to some children of their own, who have been active in the movie business for years, and often with courage, how could THEIR movie be boring?
I saw the movie, and although I don't think it boring, it is a flawed and callow movie.
The movie opens with this American couple--Roland (Pitt) and Vanessa (Jolie)--arriving at a French hotel by the sea. In a short time, our attention if riveted by their simmering resentments; apparently they have come to this beautiful and secluded place to examine and resolve their difficulties. But none of this happens. Most frustrating is their shallow and hum-drum dialogue. They don't really talk to each other. Much of the time they ignore each other, look away from each other, eat separately (with a few exceptions) and as they leave the hotel, choose diverse walking paths. And we still don't know the source of their trouble. If two married people engage only in small talk, silence, and occasional stormy fights--how can we ever find out what's inside their hearts and minds?
The action moves a notch when Jolie discovers a hole in the wall that gives her a view into the neighbors' room--a young couple on their honeymoon. Nessa (Jolie) becomes absorbed in watching this couple making love and entices her reluctant husband to watch with her. The two become voyeurs, which of course doesn't elevate their character, but which could be a gateway, in the hands of a more introspective director, to the trouble brewing inside them. But no, it doesn't open any door to revelation, or some kind of epiphany, because the two are not particularly ashamed of their voyeurism. Do they watch the couple because they need to recharge their own sex life? Do they envy the couple's youth and enthusiasm?  Mum's the word. We don't know. In an interview, Joli said that the peeping has no erotic purpose. Really? So what is it? What is it for? A riddle.
The plot could also gain speed if the young couple found out that the older couple were spying on them. Such a development could spark a riot of a conflict through which some of Roland and Vanessa's inner cauldron could finally be revealed. But that also doesn't happen. Although the two couples get together for dinners and sailing, the voyeurism continues--it fact it becomes the spine of the movie--and we don't know why. The young couple never find out that they are being observed, and so the movie drags and never gives us the understanding that every great work of art does.
It is at the end of the movie, with its faux revelation, that I could finally see the connection between Joli's movie and Albee's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf. Albee also presents a middle-aged couple (George and Martha), who are bored with and hostile towards each other. Their guests for the evening are a young couple, Honey and Nick. Both George and Nick are professors at the university in a New-England town. George and Martha play vicious games with each other and with their guests. In his humiliating game ""get the guests,"" George strips naked the souls of the guests, rather than their bodies. In Albee's rich and brave dialogue, the inside lives of the four participants are exposed in a way that moves the audience to disgust and finally tears.
What is haunting Albee's older couple, the source of their pain, is the fact that they are barren, childless. George's attempt to kill their imaginary child digs deep into Martha's grief. This final epiphany, well-prepared for earlier in the play, packs a punch that shocks the audience into an Aristotelian sense of pity for the couple. Similarly, Jolie's movie also ends with the revelation that the couple is childless, and that this is the source of their trouble, a revelation that nothing earlier in the movie prepares us for. The resolution of the movie is in the
best case unconvincing, and in the worst--a conscious, or unconscious, borrowing from Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.

Jolie's first movie, In the Land of Blood and Honey, was so magnificent and poetic, so well-structured and brilliantly acted, so moving and unforgettable that writing these lines about her last movie makes me sad but also hopeful. Surely, Joli knows how to make a movie that competes, in its theme and execution, with the best movies ever made, including Bergman's. She'll do it again, I am sure.  As Churchill said, ""Success is never final, failure never fatal. It is the courage to go on that counts.""",1468368000,2,4716,4.826946847960445

There wasn't anything all that riveting and the most interesting character in the film was the bartender. The location/scene was interesting, though the entire pallor of the the film was all beige, adding to the malaise that lacked depth as they were really dealing with common problems within marriage taking a younger couple, staying in the resort room next door to spark some life back into their own marriage. I was bored by Angie - AGAIN - looking like a mannequin for Halston/Dian Von Ferstenberg. She looks like that all the time now, stuck in a cartoon of her own vanity from the selected 70's stye and looks really creepy.

I lot of the things she brings up in this movie are questions that old married couple wonder and marvel at when seeing a young couple. There is a lot of drama until the end when you understand why she is so emotionally unstable and sad.
The acting was great! I like these two in movies. This is not an action film or comedy. We see a side to Angelina that i have not seen in other movie. More mature in her acting, more spiritual . Her acting now has a lot more substance than in recent years. The writing was great. I think she will do very well as a director and writer. The scenery is superb. I love the sets and sort of feels like you want to be there at this particular place. It feels like a very long movie because it moves slow but still interesting.",1468022400,5,903,4.022222222222222

Any movie featuring erotic nudity form Ange deserves the title of cinematic masterpiece as far as I'm concerned. I've been hooked on the allure of this woman through the nudity of GIA, the shower scene of Tomb Raider, the sexy romp in Taking Lives and the bits of her gorgeous body sprinkled throughout Wanted,Changeling and Mr and Mrs Smith.

It's hard to imagine that their personal lives weren't reflected (even in some small way) in the sad and depressing marriage that was portrayed in the film. This script was written and directed by Angelina Jolie, and while they both are good actors, I don't think this would have been a good film even with different actors. It was about a marriage that was definitely in trouble, and about two people who didn't really seem to care or want to fix anything. It was self indulgent and boring, there wasn't really anything redeeming about it. If this film is how their marriage really was it's not surprising they are no longer together.

I would suspect that there is some Mental illness at play here as this movie is definitely a lost cause and  I can't understand why Jolie and Pitt would make a movie like this which was slow, boring and depressing.  Scenery was lovely but the film itself is disturbing to watch.  One has to wonder if it somehow mirrored their real life together as they subsequently broke up not long after this film was released.
