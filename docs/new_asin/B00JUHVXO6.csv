8653902,4,B00JUHVXO6,"CHIISAI OUCHI (THE LITTLE HOUSE).  A HAUNTING, DRAMATIC TALE.

Director: Yoji Yamada
Theater (CineMatsuri 2015)
2014
Rating = ****

Full disclosure: Viewed in a theater during CineMatsuri 2015.  Film = four (4) stars; subtitles = four (4) stars.  Veteran Director Yoji Yamada provides a heart-wrenching story that moves back and forth over an 80 year span that he knows well, since he has lived through it!  Painfully sad overall, but not maudlin, the film employs a conventional plot scenario:  the recent discovery (with frequent surprises) of a diary written over many past decades by a recently deceased family member.  In the hands of Master Director Yamada, this common story vehicle makes for a most uncommon photoplay.  It is a gripping (the viewer can not escape being pulled in--resistance is, indeed, futile!), emotionally jarring tale of an upper middle-class family that lived prior to WWII and died during the war (as ""collateral damage""), and the pivotal role played by the family's  maid who has survived (by leaving Tokyo in time), and, of course, is the diary's author.  Most of the story takes place in a (relatively) little house on a hill in exurban Tokyo.  It has a distinctive red-tiled roof, hence, is often referred to as the ""little red house"" through out the film.  Direction is outstanding, and so is most of the acting.  Actress Takako Matsu delivers a consummate performance as the bored and frustrated housewife.  Cinematography (1.78 aspect ratio, color), lighting, and set design/decoration are excellent.  Music lief motif is a bit on the French side, but quite good.  Subtitles are often long, but linger sufficiently to be read without distracting from scenes.  However (and regrettably), only above-the-line names are translated in the credits.  Highly recommended.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1427414400,2,1826,5.231034482758621
