1338984,2,B00004CKFV,"A sloppy film that doesn't serve the best interests of anyone involved. Joan Fontaine is relegated to a supporting role that just about anybody could have played. Dana Andrews comes off as a mildy interested bystander, which is strange because he's the star. Most of the other performances are flat, but the real villain in this mess is the script, which is outrageously flawed. It begins with a crazy premise (frame a man for murder to prove the death penalty is flawed) and gets progressively loopier until it defies logic and credibility. To say more would be to give away too much, so I'll leave it at that. Save your money and skip it.",1359331200,,640,4.62280701754386

1338986,1,B00004CKFV,"Sorry, but I must dissent with the majority of positive reviewers for this film. The ""surprise ending"" comes out of absolutely nowhere and fatally ruins this below-average effort. Dana Andrews doesn't have much of a canvas to display his talents here, and Joan Fontaine seemed a very unlikely and unsuitable romantic partner for him. The plot skips too quickly to the courtroom trial, and I wish the death of Sidney Blackmer's character had been less contrived. The film has an intriguing concept, but unfortunately things are rushed and nothing ends up being believable. Fortunately, I rented rather than bought this DVD. I suggest that only ""rabid"" Dana Andrews or Fritz Lang fans do the same and spend the remainder of your saved cash elsewhere. Frankly, it's just not worth your time.",1340755200,5,788,5.022900763358779
1338987,4,B00004CKFV,"I think Dana Andrews is one of the truly great actors in American Cinema, the one who, together with Robert Mitchum defines what film noir really is, when it comes to acting. Fritz Lang is, by all means, a great director, but also a man of great pretentions, which leads him towards stories with rather ""important issues"" - as is the case with ""Beyond a reasonable doubt"". The result is, as often, that the ""noir"" qualites get sort of lost in this quite laboured drama, depending much too much on its surprise ending. But watching Dana Andrews at work is always such a great pleasure, that it makes the film quite worthwhile, anyway, anyhow!",1314921600,12,641,4.631578947368421
1338988,5,B00004CKFV,"""Beyond a Reasonable Doubt"" (1956) remains among director Fritz Lang's most disillusioned works. Shot in an appropriately nondescript style, this low-budget expos&eacute; on capital punishment builds to a cynical and shattering conclusion. One of RKO's last productions, the noir classic is a fitting coda to Lang's Hollywood career. The long-overdue Warner Archive DVD features an excellent Superscope transfer and the original theatrical trailer.",1308268800,27,448,6.126984126984127
1338989,5,B00004CKFV,"Stylish and well acted.  Lang knows how to twist things for the viewer and keep the suspense going.  I didn't see the end coming at all, and I won't spoil it for anyone here!  Brilliant, provocative film making at its best.  A brilliant psychological study of murder and the death penalty, and those who oppose, support, and make use of these 'institutions'.",1307232000,17,358,4.725806451612903
1338990,5,B00004CKFV,"Shot in 1956 and sinking like a stone upon release, reviled if noticed at all by everyone except a few demented French cinephiles (Jacques Rivette penned a brilliant review entitled The Hand, worth seeking out AFTER you've seen the movie), Lang's last American film is the best argument for the auteur theory I've ever seen. In pre-Hitler Germany, Lang had been, along with Lubitsch and Murnau, one of the most powerful directors in that country's film industry, with massive studio resources backing him for epics like Dr Mabuse der Spieler, The Niebelungen Saga, and Metropolis. Forced to flee to Hollywood in 1933, his autocratic persona and singularly black worldview led to intermittent successes and many more failures, as he had to abdicate his control-freak tendencies to satisfy an unforgiving industry.  Beyond A Reasonable Doubt was viewed as evidence of the sorry decline of a once-supreme talent into b-movie hackdom, and one's first viewing of the first half hour would seem to confirm this assessment. But as Lang's films forever taught us, absolutely nothing is ever what it seems and vision is always deceptive.

The first thing you will notice in BARD is a parade of cinematic horribles; flat, hideous bright key lighting, like an episode of Leave it to Beaver, particularly egregious coming from the architect of rich shadowy mise en scene Lang helped devise in his German Expressionist period and then led the way to Americanizing the look in film noir; cheap, cardboard sets, from the man who made Metropolis, a film budget-busting art directors still reference when designing the future; bad acting, particularly from an indifferent, probably soused Dana Andrews and a waxy Joan Fontaine; and a script that seems to be one half a strident, preachy anti-capital punishment screed that does its cause no good, and one half an outrageous stew of plot contrivances.

A crusading journalist attends an execution. He and his editor are both troubled by the spectacle of state sanctioned murder, and want to use the paper as a means of abolishing it. Their brilliant plan is to set up Andrews for an actual unsolved murder, plant dozens of clues pointing to his guilt, get him arrested, procure him a deliberately inept defense, and then reveal his innocense as he goes to the chair. As you can imagine, the plan works first all too well, and then goes horrifically awry as an absurd series of coincidences erase the condemned man's alibi.

Sounds contrived? Lang being Lang, he can't leave well enough alone, and the last 15 minutes of the film leads to a series of stunning reversals that leave you questioning everything you have seen and heard for the previous 75 minutes, like a hole has been ripped in the fabric of reality.  Only after you've watched the film a second time is it clear that Lang shot not one film, but two, with the second occurring largely off-screeen, gradually invading the space of the nominal shoddy narrative you have been watching. Lang's doppelganger, unacknowledged pupil and arch-rival Hitchcock attempted a similar trick in Stage Fright (another unloved film), and it felt like a trick. Lang's film feels like the author's last grim laugh at his audience, and the medium he had served since 1917, a revelation that here was an artist who could do anything he wanted to, including bend reality, even in the most unpromising production circumstances imaginable. The secret? His architetural sense of camera movement, blocking, and camera placement. While Hitchcock liked to have us identify with individuals trapped in nightmares, Lang showed us the structure of the trap itself -- which makes him a social, and not a psychological artist. I am guessing the poverty of this film's production tempted him to push his style to an extreme of abstraction, the result being a highly cerebral great movie trapped inside a bad one.

He was one of the half-dozen most influential film-makers who ever lived, I would argue more even than Hitch, and the proof is in his ""worst"" movie.",1240531200,36,4022,4.995522388059701
1338991,5,B00004CKFV,"From the times of the well known uncertain'  s principle, that established the fact you cannot determine the position and movement' s amount simultaneously due the own fact of observation' s devices distorts the absolute certainness of one of both parameters.

Fritz Lang, one the supreme masters of the direction dissected an admirable portrait in which the conceptual boundaries of guiltiness or innocence are so narrow and relative that it will make you reflecting a long, long time.

What happens when in last instance a smart investigator elaborates by his own, the scene of the crime to prove that under certain established fundamental premises, the classic patterns of logic, truth and reason may collapse like a castle of cards.

Rashomon was perhaps, the first bold step ahead in this sense in which the concept of the truth is simply a subjective approach. But those times of awful persecutions and the well known times of hunt of  witches, allowed to show this admirable and effective Noir.

The rest of this intriguing and intelligent movie runs for you my dear reader. A fabulous slap in the face for all those who bet and die for the absolute truth. If you expand this concept to another spheres of the human activities, you will understand the admirable consequences that even in our advanced technological Age we can pay. Must we remind Einstein again? ""An atom is by far, easier to destroy than a prejudice.""",1145404800,5,1425,4.916666666666667

1339004,3,B00004CKFV,Dana Andrews and  Joan Fontaine were great actors in their times. This movie could have been much better with a different plot or ending in my opinion. The ending is anti-climatic and didn't really fit the character played by Dana Andrews. I give three stars only because of the top names in the movie.,1486598400,,302,4.592592592592593

1339006,5,B00004CKFV,"As a big fan of horror and film noir I got to love Dana Andrews movies starting with Laura and Curse of the Demon his two best movies. But then
I got some of his film noir movies and the forgotten gem Forbidden Street which then got me to this movie! Beyond a reasonable doubt it's a
classic! A newspaper man who's publisher and his future father in law set himself up for murder which he didn't commit so they can prove
that the death penalty is wrong but the publisher gets killed before the end of trial and he's going to the electric chair until a note is found
explaining the entire thing as a fraud! But there is surprise ending! which I won't give away! I figured it out before the end. But it still is a
great movie and Andrews does a excellent job as always. This guy was so much better than the more famous Bogart!",1484092800,,824,4.15625

7919809,1,B00004CKFV,"Implausible to a fault, and deadly dull with zero chemistry between its stars, Dana Andrews and Joan Fontaine, this is one clunker of a thriller gone bad. Idiotic notion - a guy, actually guilty of a crime, pretending to frame himself for the crime so he can get off. What?!? Andrews is sleepwalking his way through this one. Sidney Blackmer brings something to the story but cannot save it. A whodunit that fails to gel and falls apart just as director, Fritz Lang is drawing to his climax. Don't waste your time. Warner Archive's transfer is solid but not perfect. It'll do for this heavy-handed and thoroughly stale and silly thriller. The plot is more gumbo than great, with twists and turns that never add up. Badly bungled. Very badly indeed.",1524614400,,748,4.717557251908397

7919812,5,B00004CKFV,"I know it's radical here on Amazon, but here's a review of the product actually being sold on this page - the Blu-ray of Beyond a Reasonable Doubt. Yes, the film itself is low-budget and cheap-looking, but in the end it's a Fritz Lang film so it has interest.  The story is interesting and while some don't like the final fifteen minutes, it's not out of keeping with another Lang ending that gets derided quite a bit, but one I find perfect - Woman in the Window.  But this film is not in that league.  The cast is fine and it's all of eighty minutes long.

So, the transfer.  The film has always looked cheap, know that going in.  The opticals are rank - very poorly done, but once you're out of them everything looks fine.  There is some controversy about the 2:1 ratio, with some averring it was filmed in 1.85 and only shown in Europe in the 2:1 ratio, RKO-Scope (aka Superscope).  But I'm not sure any of that is accurate as the trailer on the disc, clearly the US trailer, clearly states RKO-Scope and frankly the film looks fine in that ratio.  I do like the film and if you do you'll probably be fine with the Blu-ray.",1521676800,8,1127,4.303317535545023
