7964295,5,B000068MBL,"The product had great animation and dubbing. It even came with free stickers. There was no Japanese dub, but I did not want that anyway. The English dub was much better than the original Japanese.",1385164800,,196,4.628571428571429
7964296,5,B000068MBL,"Great show came wrapped in what i think is original wrap, unscratched good disk, no skipping or bootleg quality. Just wish this show was still on.",1364428800,,146,4.653846153846154
7964297,4,B000068MBL,"Bit Cloud is a wandering junk parts dealer. He collects parts to build the ultimate Zoid partner. One day he meets a group of Zoid warriors and a Zoid called Liger Zero. He joins their team and begins to fight with them in organized Zoid competitions. Even though these competitions are a friendly sport, there are dubious people that use Zoids to gain power and strike fear into others. Bit, Liger Zero, and his teammates are on the front lines of that battle.

This is a pretty good series. It's nowhere near as good as Zoids Chaotic Century, but it's a lot of sun and very entertaining. There are some very compelling characters and awesome battle scenes. The animation, and voice acting are a bit better than average. You should recognize Bit Cloud's voice actor as Richard Cox, the same guy that played Inuyasha. The story is a little weak and not very deep, but it's okay. The series is fun and is definitely worth watching. As I mentioned before, Chaotic Century is way better. The problem is that it's out of print and very rare. You could easily spend over $700 on the complete series. I suggest checking this one out first. If you like this series and don't mind opening your wallet, Chaotic Century will provide more enjoyment than this spinoff.",1354838400,,1256,4.632286995515695
7964298,1,B000068MBL,Love ZOIDS and was looking foward to watching the whole series start to finish but this one was boxed wrong and the sender told me to take it up with Amazon cause he couldn't do anything about it.,1315008000,,196,4.184210526315789
7964299,5,B000068MBL,"This other reviewer is nuts. Zoids: New Century is one of ,y favorite all-time series'. The action is classic and fresh at the same time. The dialogue can be hilarious and the voice-actors (English) are superb. Richard Cox (Bit) is the man!",1067904000,5,240,4.738095238095238
7964300,5,B000068MBL,"As you've noticed this vol. is called The Coliseum Battle,but there are no titles refering to this in this vol.,so by my terms this refers to the last episode in the series. There 4 episodes(like any other vol.).The episodes featured are The Princess Arrives:Mary Champ in which Harry looses all his zoids. His Sister Mary comes to talk him out of zoid battling. He tells her he's in it to beat Bit and win Leena which Mary thinks Leena is a push over. She sees the ligerzero and chanlges the Blitz team to a battle for it. But they loose and the ligerzero remains for the Blitz team and Mary decides to let Harry loose...i mean try to win his battles. Next Desert Tusk:Assult of the War Sharks the Fofma team vs. the Blitz team, The Sensational Three:Rematch with Jack Cicso in which the Blitz team looses their first battle,and Zero is Stolen:The Firey Battle. This episode is what the title refers too. In this episode Zero is stolen by the Backdraft and Bit has to fight the Elephander and be apart of the Backdraft or they'll eraese Liger's memory. The two fight in a coliseum which is interuted by the Hover Cargo's assult of gun fire. I won't tell you the rest you'll just have to find out yourself. You should buy this series of excetment today.",1023926400,7,1253,4.5
