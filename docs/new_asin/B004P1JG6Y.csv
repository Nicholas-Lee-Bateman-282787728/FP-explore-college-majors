8437405,5,B004P1JG6Y,"Very interesting program about the 21st century spitfire plane, the EFA or Eurofighter. Eurofighter Typhoon is the world's most advanced new generation multi-role/swing-role combat aircraft currently available on the market. With 719 aircraft on contract and 571 aircraft on order by seven nations (United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Spain, Austria, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Sultanate of Oman), Eurofighter Typhoon is Europe's largest military collaborative program and delivers leading-edge technologies, strengthening the European aerospace and defense industry in the international competition. Since entry-into-service in 2004, more than 370+ aircraft have been delivered and the whole Eurofighter fleet has accumulated more than 180,000 flying hours (June 2013)worldwide. The Eurofighter Typhoon is unique in modern combat aircraft in that there are four separate assembly lines. Each partner company assembles its own national aircraft, but builds the same parts for all 683 aircraft (including exports).The Typhoon's combat performance, compared to the F-22 Raptor and the upcoming F-35 Lightning II fighters and the French Dassault Rafale, has been the subject of much discussion. In March 2005, United States Air Force Chief of Staff General John P. Jumper, then the only person to have flown both the Eurofighter Typhoon and the Raptor, talked to Air Force Print News about these two aircraft. He said,

""The Eurofighter is both agile and sophisticated, but is still difficult to compare to the F/A-22 Raptor. They are different kinds of airplanes to start with; it's like asking us to compare a NASCAR car with a Formula One car. They are both exciting in different ways, but they are designed for different levels of performance. The Eurofighter is certainly, as far as smoothness of controls and the ability to pull (and sustain high g forces), very impressive. That is what it was designed to do, especially the version I flew, with the avionics, the color moving map displays, etc. -- all absolutely top notch. The maneuverability of the airplane in close-in combat was also very impressive"".

It cost five billion pounds to produce the Eurofighter, and over ten years of development. But, I think, all would agree that the cost and time were well worth the effort.

The Russian MiG-29 was in competition with the Eurofighter amongst the European nations. Refined versions of the MiG-29 with improved avionics were fielded by the Soviet Union, but variants, including a carrier-based version designated MiG-29K, were never produced in large numbers. Some more advanced versions are still being pursued for export, and updates of existing Russian aircraft are likely. New fighter versions called MiG-29M/M2 and MiG-29SMT have been developed. Furthermore, development of the MiG-29K carrier version has been resumed for the Indian Navy's aircraft carrier.

Nato forces are continuing to develop and test newer, faster aircraft, but the Eurofighter is one of their proudest developments.

There is great classic archival footage of missile launches from aircraft and battle scenes from World War II.

A very interesting and informative program for any aviation enthusiast! You really must watch this.....",1378512000,,3213,5.50709939148073
8437406,5,B004P1JG6Y,"I gave this a five because the quality of the production and the footage is excellant! It details the history of the development
of the Eurofighter to some of the first flights by the first production models. Its story is told by aviation experts in an informative
and interesting way with a lot of recent footage. This is the only documentary I have been able to find on this fighter and it was
definitely worth the money to buy it. I will keep this as apart of my collection and I think it is a great addition to any aviation
enthusiast's collection!",1363392000,,552,4.421568627450981
