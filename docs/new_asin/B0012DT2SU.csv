3086486,5,B0012DT2SU,"I was bored and disillusioned with 2012 and wanted to seek out a new frontier in jogging fitness. Rummaging through my bottom dresser drawer, I found the estranged crystal to my time machine. Climbing in with my purple and orange fitness shoes, I set the dial for somewhere between the late 70's and early 80's. To my surprise and delight, upon landing my craft and disembarking I was met by a wonderfully playful group of EBE's (extraterrestrial biological entities), all adorned in spandex thong workout attire and what appeared to be Pendelton shirts! Fascinated, I joined them on a wild and often frenetic expedition of jogging and jumping in place while in simulated gravity and smart little dance moves interspersed with naughty twists and turns. I'm certain that one of the male aliens was Marky Mark! All that aside, I particularly enjoyed the Flashdance Memorial Salute and the mischievously spritely way the beings parted my company. I would highly recommend this video to anyone who is looking for a worthwhile and vastly entertaining workout.

3086497,2,B0012DT2SU,"This is an extremely dated workout video. This is a major throwback to the early 80's, I'm guessing.  The group of ""instructors,"" they don't instruct, come out wearing tight spandex workout gear, button down shirts, and baseball caps.  (Eventually, they turn around and there is noting but butts, as ALL the women are wearing thongs with pantyhose.)  As you guessed it, the soundtrack matches the era (outdated) and is very similar throughout except the ode to country.

After they appear, they begin to move.  No instruction is given from any of the people on screen. The only guide are very confusing graphics that hardly represent the upcoming movie.  You really have to keep watch. because of this lack of talking.  The grapevine went 4 slow, 4 fast, to 2 slow, 2 fast and back without warning.  This caused me to not really keep to the movements all that well.

Not to mention, there wasn't much jogging.  I won't say none, because there was slow jogging in place.  However, I normally don't see people jogging by only moving the bottom portion of their legs (below the knees).  Out of the 30 minutes of this ""jogging"" video, I did not have a single minute of vigorous activity (I use a BodyBugg to keep track).  I did have 18 minutes of moderate activity, which I could have gotten walking 2.5 miles per hour on a treadmill or down the street.

I would also point out that this video really isn't all that safe.  If an exercise novice is attempting to follow along, they may stop and actually attempt to figure out the not so helpful graphics.  Stopping and standing still, like the performers did, is so very bad for your heart/body.  Also, the stretches are not done in a way that really relaxes the muscles after a workout.  Thank goodness I workout enough to know how to do it correctly.

The ONLY reason I am not giving this 1 star is that I did work up a sweat.  Then again, it is 80 something degrees in my house, so that may have attributed to it. In all seriousness, I did burn 167 calories in during that time (of course I burn nearly double that walking slowly on the treadmill).",1410998400,,2096,4.523936170212766

Let's be honest, most of us assume that any title that starts with Viva is either paper towels or porn, but in this case Viva Jogging is breaking through that barrier.  The footage is fuzzy right from the get go, and honestly, it doesn't get better, but on the upside, you can still make out the eerily robotic like expressions on the ""joggers'"" faces, as mentioned by other reviewers.

If I had to pick a favorite part, I would go with the warm-up.  How often can you grab your flannel shirt and trucker hat and incorporate it into an exercise routine? Now, if you squint closely you can see the Lumberjack in the back breathing most obscenely threw his mouth throughout that entire sequence, which was definitely distracting, but if you can push through, it's definitely worth it!

Occasionally they break away from the live action (I hope) to show a cartoon drawing of one of those wooden artist models showing us...well....I'm not sure really, but I took those opportunities to get a drink and throw in a load of laundry.

And this may sound weird, but I swear at the 9:00 mark our woodland fellow was trying to teach me the PeeWee Herman dance, but that could be what I WANTED to see, which is why I did it. By 9:15 I was led back into a live action hoe-down that just screamed for that song ""Cotton Eyed Joe"", which I secretly played in my head all the way through it, producing more pep in my step and increasing my washboard tempo ( have to see it to understand). Maybe they'll upgrade with the song in future versions. Hint-Hint Viva!

The workout was keeping a steady pace when something interesting happened at 19:45. The group was jogging in place, again, and then, without warning, they made a perfectly synchronized spin.  During the unnaturally coordinated move, I saw multiple flashes of the ""joggers"" backsides and I realized that all the ladies were wearing thong exercise panties! WTF!  At first I was angry because I was exhausted and now convinced they really were robots, because who the hell can exercise with floss in their crack? Unachievable goal! But after further review I realized they were wearing pantyhose, thwarting that particular grossness, while potentially creating another.  So I continued on, tired.

I will say that I was happy to see that by 21:00 the group as a whole was getting a lot less coordinated.  Arms were off tempo, some feet faster than others, and smiles waning.  And even though I couldn't see it through the grainy view, I knew that whatever sweat was not dripping from their foreheads and armpits was being held in by pantyhose and singlets, which made me smile, then go ""eewww!"".

The cool down stretches were performed to the Mario Bros soundtrack and started at about 24:00. By 26:34 they were done with the cool downs and flashbacks and sent me off with the only spoken word on the video.....a super creepy dude saying, "" Feeling Good Now"". I'm sure you are perv, I'm sure you are.

So you might be asking, ""Is this low impact?"" Well, truthfully, the only impact this video will probably have is on your self esteem if you're caught watching it.............If I was one of the ""joggers"" I would want this video to get out about as much as a homemade sex tape...but that's not gonna stop me from watching it again.",1403049600,3,3363,4.638047138047138

3086503,5,B0012DT2SU,"This video gave me one of the best workouts I've had in quite a while, but identifying the elements to which I attribute the tape's effectiveness is hard to do. Is it blue socks girl's inability to figure out which way her arms go when she runs? Is it the progressively more intense wince/chuckle evoked by the man in teal's increasingly uncomfortable moose toe? Could it be the overwhelming feeling that just out of the camera shot is a firing squad ready to execute the first one to stop bouncing?

The world may never know.

Certainly not for everyone, but I do look forward to continuing to explore this engaging universe through their many other hostage ransom tapes.

There was no speaking throughout.  Nobody ever said ""hello, welcome, let's start""...not a word was spoken.  The people were dressed like 80's zombies & with plastic smiles.  The workout looked weak (bunch of step-touch no impact stuff).  It says the video is 27 minutes, i watched about 10 minutes of it in disbelief before turning it off.  It is humorous, but doesn't look very challenging.  Not sure why they call it ""Jogging"".  It's basically just no-impact bouncing with arm swinging.

3086517,5,B0012DT2SU,"Love this exercise dvd.  I do not care what people where when they exercise, but if you want to sweat off the pounds this can do it.  You can make it as high end as you want or as low impact as you want.  Very good beat to generic music that keeps you moving.  I do very high impact when the instructors are on and then walk in place during the animated portion to get a good interval training workout.  I also incorporate my own choreography or exercise moves during the jogging portions whenever I feel like it or just follow the lead at other times.  I also do my own low impact portion during the stretching along with the slower beat and then do my own stretching when it is over to get in a full 30+ minute workout. I feel great after this workout and use it on my shorter workout days. I would highly recommend.",1369094400,,818,4.1455696202531644

3321003,1,B0012DT2SU,I thought I was going to watch a beginner jogging program. This video is so dated and no jogging was ever mentioned!!  Boo,1394409600,,122,4.304347826086956
3321004,1,B0012DT2SU,No jogging involved.  1970's spandex bad. Not worth your time unless you have too much time on your hands and need a chuckle.,1390521600,,125,4.434782608695652
3321005,5,B0012DT2SU,I watched and did this with my kids. We were all laughing hysterically throughout. It was a lot of fun.,1390348800,,103,4.2
3321006,1,B0012DT2SU,If you want to flashback to the 80s you can watch this video. Not a good workout at all! Two thumbs down.,1390348800,,105,3.8181818181818183
3321007,1,B0012DT2SU,"First of all, this video is NOT about jogging.  It is a very old, ridiculously old, aerobics video.  If you want a good laugh at the costumes of the onscreen talent and the absolute dated material being offered, watch this video.  And it's probably even a good workout.  But really, trying to sell this video as a jogging video is an absolute misrepresentation.  DO NOT BUY IT!  I was lucky to be able to review it on Prime for free.",1389830400,2,433,4.35
3321008,1,B0012DT2SU,Don't even put it in your queue. Stuff like this should go away.  Not  worth your time unless your looking for an 80's outfit,1389139200,2,125,4.166666666666667
3321009,2,B0012DT2SU,"I played this just to see if i would be interested in doing it...it went through some previews & then on came some whacky 80's 21 Jumpstreet/Flashdance people smiling & doing 80's type aerobic moves to techno-type music...i watched for a bit still waiting for the REAL exercise video to start...when i realized this IS the ACTUAL exercise video.  There was no speaking throughout.  Nobody ever said ""hello, welcome, let's start""...not a word was spoken.  The people were dressed like 80's zombies & with plastic smiles.  The workout looked weak (bunch of step-touch no impact stuff).  It says the video is 27 minutes, i watched about 10 minutes of it in disbelief before turning it off.  It is humorous, but doesn't look very challenging.  Not sure why they call it ""Jogging"".  It's basically just no-impact bouncing with arm swinging.  Very ridiculous.",1386892800,,853,4.99290780141844
3321010,2,B0012DT2SU,"Ok, if you lived the old-fashioned low impact aerobics from the 80's, legwarmers, shiny spandex, headbands and all, this is for you! These exercises still work. BUT, this video is so old, and has NOTHING to do with jogging.",1381190400,,223,4.743589743589744
3321011,2,B0012DT2SU,Very cheesey!! It still works though and the option to play it on demand is a great thing. I wish it was more updated though.,1375574400,,125,4.04
3321012,1,B0012DT2SU,This was the worst exercise video I can imagine! There was no excitement or motivating features at all-don't waste your time!,1373760000,,125,5.0
3321013,2,B0012DT2SU,This is workout seems very old and cheesy. 1980ish. I couldn't do it with out laughing out loud. Very low budget.,1371340800,,113,4.428571428571429
3321014,5,B0012DT2SU,"Love this exercise dvd.  I do not care what people where when they exercise, but if you want to sweat off the pounds this can do it.  You can make it as high end as you want or as low impact as you want.  Very good beat to generic music that keeps you moving.  I do very high impact when the instructors are on and then walk in place during the animated portion to get a good interval training workout.  I also incorporate my own choreography or exercise moves during the jogging portions whenever I feel like it or just follow the lead at other times.  I also do my own low impact portion during the stretching along with the slower beat and then do my own stretching when it is over to get in a full 30+ minute workout. I feel great after this workout and use it on my shorter workout days. I would highly recommend.",1369094400,,818,4.1455696202531644
3321015,1,B0012DT2SU,"Hideous. Hysterical. Outdated. Low budget. The ""actors"" wear 90s grunge flannel shirts during the warm up. They are completely silent during the entire workout with fake smiles pasted on their faces - so disturbing - the look of serial killers. The attire and silence alone is too distracting for me - I tried to do the workout but couldn't stop laughing.",1362355200,17,355,4.836065573770492
8245220,1,B0012DT2SU,"This is an absurd DVD.  No one should ever buy it.  It includes cartoon characters and is from the 70s.  I would return it, but it would probably cost as much to return.  There is no real jogging involved.",1484352000,,205,4.17948717948718

The flannel shirts over spandex are distracting, The dancers are creepily silent, and it's just aerobics. '80s Kathy Smith Susan Powter aerobics!
