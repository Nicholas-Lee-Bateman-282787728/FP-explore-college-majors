8000048,1,B0000D8UC4,"A biker race fight develops when Eddie (Robert Howard) is killed by white bikers for dating a white girl. The claim to fame for this film is that it has six NFL stars in the feature with Joe Greene being the most recognized name in the modern era. Outside of Gene Washington, the speaking roles for the players were limited as their acting was as bad as their white counterparts in the film.

8000051,5,B0000D8UC4,"The Black Six is not your standard biker exploitation film by any means this is one of very few; it is also a blacksploitation film, enhanced by its cast of all star football players of the era. So really where do you go from there, in all honesty what do you rate it against, there weren't that many black biker movies made.

The movie is basically about a white girl / black guy who fall in love. The white girls brother is the leader of a bike club and a racist, he and his club kill the black kid. The Black six are (as the title implies) six black army buddies who ride together. And just for good measure to thicken the plot the guy, killed by the racist bikers happens to be the brother of one of the Black Six, so now there is the revenge thing with some adventure on the way.

I highly recommend the Black Six based on the all-around bad acting, crappy background music, poor film stock and corny framing, it's high camp for those who are starved for poor taste.

Connoisseurs of the bad will love this one, even though it really is awful and you'd be a sucker to want to watch it, you would be a bigger sucker to pass on the chance to own it.

I read some of the other reviews about this movie most complaining about the sound quality, the copy I purchased on Amazon was a fine specimen, the sound was good the film quality was a little distorted in a few scenes (no doubt from the tracking of the VHS it was copied from) Over all I was completely thrilled to secure such cinematic milestone as the Black Six",1259712000,3,1518,4.188356164383562
8000052,4,B0000D8UC4,"Unlike the other review, we had NO problems with sound quality. This movie may seem like a ""Bootleg"" or a bad copy to some. You have to consider that the movie orginally only came on VHS or Hi-Fi reel to reel. this is the first movie that mean Joe Green acted in and it shows in some areas. As a foorball fan and a fan of this area of movies. I give it a 4 out of 5.",1217548800,2,366,3.7051282051282053
8000053,1,B0000D8UC4,"THIS DVD IS ABSOLUTE CRAP QUALITY - WORSE THAN AN AGED VHS!

THE SOUND ONLY COMES OUT OF THE LEFT SPEAKER - AND IS NASTY QUALITY THROUGHOUT. AND...THE CREDITS ARE CUT OFF, THEY DIDNT RECORD IT ONTO THE DVD PAST ""IN ORDER OF APPEARANCE""

TOTALLY USELESS DVD",1107907200,14,256,4.425531914893617
