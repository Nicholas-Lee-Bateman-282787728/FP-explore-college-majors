Introduction

Proper Equipment  - This chapter takes a look at custom parts and modifications made to pistols, magazines and holsters to give shooters small advantages in competition.

The Art of the Draw - Lenny  Magill analyzes the draw and shooting style, techniques and methods of each shooter  as they are shown drawing firing their guns.

The competition shooters are Rob Leatham, Brian Enos,  Jerry Barnhart, Chip McCormick,  J. Michael Plaxco, Ken Tapp.

Bob Munden is not part of the competition.  But, he is shown in this video not with a custom modified semiautomatic and holster.  Instead, he uses a western style pistol and holster and shoots from the hip draw.  His time is faster than all of the competition shooters.  The fastest competition shooters were Ken Tapp at .84 seconds and Brian Enos at .82 seconds.  But,  Bob Munden shoots with recorded speeds in the range of .45 and .13 seconds.

One on One with the Pro's - Lenny Magill interviews each of the competition shooters about their training and preparation for shooting competitions.  There are good tips here for those who want to listen to and learn how to increase their shooting speed.  One of the things some of the shooters have in common is the emphasis they put upon  good dry fire practice.

Sweet Spot Theory - Lenny Magill hypothesizes that the front sight of the gun has a proper location in the line of the shooters site that will produce accurate shooting results.  Shooters train their bodies to remember where this proper location, the sweet spot,  is with repetition so that they don't have to think about it while drawing and shooting.  Their body already knows where and how to point the gun to the target.  The eyes and mind only verifies the shot.

As the previous reviewer said, the DVD cover for this video indicates that in plays for 60 minutes.  But, it actually plays for only 47 minutes.  All the other DVDs produced by Lenny Magill that I have bought do play for the full 60 minutes.  This is a loss of almost a quarter of the playing time expected.  So, I also give the DVD only 3 stars.  Otherwise, I would have given it 4 stars if it had actually played for 60 minutes.

8024105,3,B0002911DO,"Narrated by Lenny Magill, this video is a series of clips showing some of the fastest pistol shooters in the world in competition. The clips are done at regular speed, slow motion, different angles and side by side to contrast different techniques.  The common elements are pointed out, i.e. how little each shooter moves (economy of motion) when drawing from the holster.

Although the description says 60 minutes of video, it is actually 47 minutes long with an additional 30 minutes of advertising for other titles at the end.  The advertisements are long enough to be somewhat educational, but I would still prefer more of the topic on the cover instead of a relatively short segment followed by a video catalog.

Overall this is a good video that is worthwhile if you want to see and hear how competitive shooters develop their speed.  An added treat is a short clip of Bob Munden drawing and hitting his target in 0.13 seconds.  You will have to rewind several times to believe it.",1162339200,6,987,4.742690058479532
