4767690,5,B005LAIII0,"This is a marvelous movie although my wife disliked the section of killing animals in the life boat.  That is what animals do to one another!  The visuals were amazing, especially the zoo scene at the beginning.  I am a lover of 3D and this film uses it to the absolute visual apogee.  Of all the 3D movies, I have viewed this film was the best.  I noticed camera angles were always correct and lighting was superb.  This movie is not for children!

4767691,5,B005LAIII0,"Ang Lee is a director that most individuals don't seem to be too fond of. To this day, his ""Hulk"" film remains unwatched because so many people have offered their opinion that it's awful. ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is in the same category, but for different reasons. Wuxia films are almost always better when the wire work is more subtle and ""Crouching Tiger"" looks to take no shame in everyone flying around at all times. ""Brokeback Mountain"" was the only Lee film to be experienced before ""Life of Pi"" and that was solely because seeking out Heath Ledger's work seemed like a pretty vital thing to do after ""The Dark Knight."" Going into ""Life of Pi,"" there was literally no interest. The book hadn't been read beforehand and trailers had not been seen. Expectations were mostly, ""It may be gorgeous to look at, but will lack any sort of depth."" One of the best feelings in the world is having your misconceptions about something be completely wrong and work out in ways you never imagined.

""Life of Pi"" is narrated by an older Pi (Irrfan Khan) and takes place in the present as he tells his life story to a writer (Rafe Spall). Pi begins with how he got his name and how his family owned a zoo, but eventually leads into his family needing to leave India for financial purposes. The heart of the story lies in Pi as a young man (played by Suraj Sharma) and the time he spent out at sea on a lifeboat with a tiger named Richard Parker, but getting to that point is quite an ordeal. Pi loses everything and everyone close to him in the blink of an eye and he doesn't count on making what feels like an unbreakable bond with a Bengal tiger.

The story is first introduced to the writer by a friend of the family called Mamaji and tells the writer that Pi's story will ""make him believe in God."" Mamaji is a champion swimmer and there's at least one really spectacular sequence at the beginning of the film where you see Mamaji swimming. The film is shot beautifully and makes full use of eye catching perspectives including overhead shots of the ocean. Pi begins on the lifeboat with a zebra, a hyena, and an orangutan, but the animals are an intricate part of the story. It's not entirely seamless as you can tell when real animals are being used and when CG enters the picture, but the transition from one to the other is relatively flawless.

The adventure film offers a rather marvelous message about religion as Pi discusses the experimentation with several different religions as a young boy. Even though it seems kind of silly that a boy has adopted so many religions at one point in his life, it portrays a religious message in a light that doesn't seem too preachy which is very welcome and unusual for a message of this caliber. But the religious aspect is really only a backdrop for being on your own path to finding who you really are. Feeling so alone for so long and having Pi talk about not being alone and not getting to say goodbye to those he cared about most is one of those things that just hits you really hard.

While witnessing Pi attempt to tame Richard Parker is really entertaining, there are so many unbelievable sights to witness in ""Life of Pi."" There's the whale, the jellyfish, the flying fish, that disastrous storm, and that seaweed island with all of the meerkats. ""Life of Pi"" never really lets up on being visually astounding from beginning to end. A personal favorite is when Pi starts seeing visions in the ocean and what he questions as being a daydream or a night dream.

""Life of Pi"" is pleasantly satisfying. With a heartfelt message, beautiful visuals, and stunning camera work, ""Life of Pi"" is truly a sight to behold and illustrates how essential 3D can be to a film that isn't a summer blockbuster.",1353542400,26,3750,4.525073746312684
4767692,5,B005LAIII0,"Wow, this has been an exciting fall for literary adaptations!  I read Yann Martel's Life of Pi a decade ago and thought it was fantastic storytelling.  I cheered when it won the Man Booker Prize.  So, I was quite excited to attend an advance screening recently with several members of my book group.  I remembered the novel quite well in broad strokes, but not the fine detail.  I didn't refresh my memory before watching the film, but was curious enough to reread Life of Pi in its entirety before writing this review.  The film is very true to the novel in spirit and tone, but there are small changes, additions (generally positive), and elisions (some noteworthy).

The film opens similarly to the novel.  The idea is the same, but the execution is slightly different.  Different mediums require different storytelling tools.  For instance, I believe most film-goers will readily recognize The Writer (portrayed by actor Rafe Spall, who replaced a distractingly famous Toby Maguire) as a stand-in for author Martel.  In the novel, it is Martel himself, in direct address to readers, who fulfills this role, effectively blurring the line between fact and fiction.  It is established that this story is being related to The Writer by an older Pi.  From there, readers are introduced to a young Piscine Molitor Patel and the world he inhabits.  It's a charmed childhood, being raised at the Pondicherry Zoo amongst a loving family and exotic animals--an Indian ""We Bought a Zoo.""  These scenes are as lush and colorful as any Bollywood musical.

I've discussed this novel with other readers countless times over the years.  It's beloved by many, but truly hated by a vocal minority.  I've never understood the vitriol, personally.  Martel writes beautifully and accessibly.  His story is fast-paced and yet deeply rooted in character.  And it explores the boundless subject of faith through an extraordinary tale--a ""story to make you believe in God.""  But one complaint I've heard from readers is frustration over (or lack of interest in) Pi's religious explorations early in the novel.  The young man is a practicing Hindu, Christian, and Muslim.  Martel never belabored the point, but those readers will be gratified to see that director Ang Lee has streamlined the beginning of the tale to move more swiftly to the meat of the story.

And that comes about when Pi's family packs up their lives, their animals, and moves the whole kit and caboodle to Canada by ship.  Well, that's the plan.  Something goes wrong in rough seas outside of Manila.  The ship goes down in a haunting scene, and now the stage is set.  Sixteen-year-old Pi is shipwrecked in a lifeboat with a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena, and a 450-pound adult Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.  It's survival of the fittest on the high seas, and things get Darwinian fast.  Soon enough, it's Pi and Richard Parker in it together.

When I first heard the premise of this novel, somehow I thought Richard Parker would be some kind of cute, anthropomorphized tiger, and oversized puddy tat.  He was not.  He was a terrifying predator, and he stayed a terrifying predator, throughout Pi's ordeal.  This was much the same in the movie (although not quite to the degree as in the novel, a change commented upon by Martel in the Hollywood Reporter).  Richard Parker was scary in the book, but he was terrifying on the screen.  I flinched as he snarled and lunged in 3D.

From here, both novel and film take on an episodic or picaresque quality.  The film is delightfully dream-like from its opening frames.  (An early scene of the swimming pool from which Pi derives his name enchanted me!)  But as the days at sea pass, and the ribs of both animals become plainly visible, the film shifts from dream-like to hallucinatory.  Episodes and encounters become increasingly extraordinary.  Sitting in the audience, I could clearly discern who had read the novel and who had not by the gasps and exclamations.  (Among my friends, the film was enjoyed equally by those who had read the book and those who had not.)

Yes, there are episodes that are missing from the film, one of which is quite notable.  Fans may miss it.  And, yet, I can understand the choices made.  Cuts were judicious.  As noted earlier there are a few small shifts and changes.  But this is a very faithful adaptation of Martel's novel, and I suspect it will please most fans of the original.  What is lost is more than made up for by how Ang Lee has brought Martel's fantastic vision to life.

The cinematography and design of this film is exquisitely beautiful.  I'm not a huge fan of 3D technology, but once in a while it seems to really augment a film.  Such is the case here--all the better to experience a small boat on the vast ocean.  And while we're on the subject of technology, the CGI work on the tiger is seamless.  None of us could detect where the real tiger ended and the computer-generated beast began.  I have heard that young Suraj Sharma never once filmed with the live animal.  For safety, their scenes were filmed separately.  And I don't know how much footage was of a real cat.  All I can say is that the illusion is extraordinarily believable.  That a first-time actor could give such a convincing performance playing opposite an imaginary tiger is doubly impressive.  The success of the film lies firmly on Sharma's moving portrayal of 16-year-old Pi, but the supporting performances were equally strong.  It was Spall's response to Pi's story at the end of the film that actually gave me chills.

I've been circumspect about revealing specifics of the plot.  I'll leave all the surprises of Pi's voyage intact for those new to the tale.  And readers of the novel can see for themselves what made the cut.  About the ending...  Those who have read the novel know what to expect.  Now film-goers can join the debate we've been having for the past decade.  In the end, it truly is all about faith.  Which story do you prefer?",1352937600,676,5974,4.76
4767693,5,B005LAIII0,"There are times I am out of step with popular trends; I was urged to read Yann Martel's enormously popular novel while it was on the best-seller list. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that I did not like it, in fact I disliked it! To me, the story of an Indian boy who is shipwrecked with a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan and a Bengal tiger is a bit much.

With the astonishing Ang Lee as the director (""The Wedding Banquet,"" ""Sense and Sensibility,"" ""Brokeback Mountain,"" ""Hulk,"" and ""The Ice Storm""), things started looking up. As you can see from this sample of his work, this much-acclaimed artist never stays with one genre, never copies other filmmakers and never plays it safe. He rarely makes a PG film and I think this is his first 3D project.

He did wonders with his cast:
  * Suraj Sharma (in his first film role) is Pi, an adventurous, inquisitive youngster. He has settled on being a vegetarian Hindu Muslim who embraces Catholic guilt, studies the Jewish Kabbalah, and wants to be baptized. He is convinced that religion is a big house with many rooms.
  * Irrfan Khan (""Slumdog Millionaire"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man"") is the adult Pi, who tells his spellbinding tale to a would-be author.
  * Rafe Spall (""Prometheus"") is our incredulous listener, The Writer, who speaks for us as he expresses all the confusion, dismay and doubt that we in the audience naturally feel.
  * The tiger who plays Richard Parker is a seamless combination of real life and computer generated images. Brilliant!

3D is rarely used this well, maybe you can get a new player from Amazon. The opening credit sequence that takes us through a small municipal zoo in India is a marvel, and the scenes with clear water are breathtaking: you can't tell water from air, so things seem to be floating above the earth. Kudos to Cinematographer Claudio Miranda for the dazzling effects! (We LOVED the flying fish!)

The continuity is consistently good: as time goes by in the lifeboat, our hero and our tiger are visibly thinner, the tiger's teeth become greenish and both of them have dry unhealthy hair. The shipwreck is tough to see, but we don't have to watch carnivores kill their lunch, and when Pi finally brains a fish, he weeps and apologizes to it. Don't show this to toddlers, but from ten years old and up, I think a child can handle it.

In my opinion, this was much better than the book! (But I still hate the island!)",1352505600,15,2420,4.613053613053613

It strengthens the trust in science to put the creator or God mixed with religious BS, and to doubt a creator. Those this film's motivs and large theme is to convince young and naive viewers to leave faith to fiction and trust science. It juxtaposes these examples in unrelated circumstances to drive the point with no doubt.

4768038,5,B005LAIII0,"Times have changed.  Though I am young, 20 years of age at the time of writing this, even I have noticed the global perception of religion has changed dramatically.  Knowledge and opinion on religion and the concept of a God in and of itself has become something of a controversial topic.  Many people around my age or even older, more than ever, are not only atheists but question why, in a world of our unprecedented technological advances, widespread political unrest and rampant social activism, we even need religion as a part of society anymore.

As a religious person all my life, it is a question I have always somewhat had an answer for, and this is an answer that is unique to each and every theist.  But maybe what I appreciate about this film is that it somewhat effectively answers that question for atheists as well.  I know few atheists but from what I have seen many atheists have grown not only an appreciation but even an amount of respect for the concept of religion after watching this film.

The film is fantastic by all technical standpoints.  It's visuals are incredibly well done.  It doesn't bombard you with spectacular cgi, it uses cgi as it should be... a compliment to the film itself, not a substitute for it.  Even after 6 years this is some of the best usage of the visual spectrum in film I have personally seen.  Not only that but the movie is filmed in a way that gives the entire film a dream like nature, and coupled with the visuals that just barely escape the confines of our reality, with things that certainly exist but aren't likely to be seen by the eyes of man - this creates a film experience unlike any other.  You feel enlightened while watching this movie, to simplify it.

This is a testament to the masterful direction of Ang Lee.  He made the film that many considered unfilmable due to its nature.  And he did it with care and skill apparent in every shot.  The way he adapted the story was nearly flawless, and while there are scenes un the book I'd love to see on film, this movie sends the message of the book with perfect effectiveness.

Suraj Sharma was given a hefty task for his first film.  He has to carry the emotional weight of the audience and his own character for the majority of this film, accompanied by no one but a cgi tiger.  He does this maaterfully, and it can only be concluded that he is either naturally gifted or his training was superb.  His performance as Pi is moving and captivating and will stay with you long, long after the film credits roll.  The rest of the cast do great as well, notably Irfan Khan who is always a talent worth watching.  His and Sharmas performances as the same character in different stages of life compliment each other to completion, you couldn't take one of them out and still get such a fully realized character.

Richard Parker is a masterpiece of technical achievement, yes, but he plays a much larger part in this film than that.  Ang Lee skillfully uses our own natural amazement and wonder of nature - that feeling of awe that you get as you stare into the gaze of a wild creature at a zoo or even in your backyard - and uses this to create a creature, and a character of that you cannot help but revere.  I will never forget - my first time seeing this film, during the nighttime sequence in the middle of it, my father began to wonder if the tiger would actually start speaking.  The film pushes these boundaries so skillfully... that you actually began to believe it may be possible, even in a story such as this.  That's the indescribable beauty of this film, it uses the awe inspiring to inspire awe, and it makes you question your own perception of what's happening, which leads me to my final point.

The ending if this film has garnered much attention for being what many consider to be the defining point of this movie.  Without going into too much detail, the movie asks you to question everything you've just watch - from the moment Pi enters the boat with his family until he is found - and offers you a completely different version of it.  And then it gives you the option to decide which you think is the better story.  Like the book it is based on, it takes a huge risk that lesser films have tried and failed to accomplish.  But the way it is done in this movie makes it not a nuisance, but a deep and thoughtful question.  It presents one possible answer to the question but does not show you any bias towards one of them.  It is purely up to you, and where you're life experiences have led you, to decide.  That's where this film is truly unlike any other.  It makes you question your views, your perception, and yes... even your faith - or lack thereof.

It's hard to put into words what makes this film special to me.  I was young, 14, when I saw it, but it has stayed with me ever since then.  I initially had no desire to see it, I hadn't read the book or even heard of it before. But when I left the theater I had grown a deeper appreciation for the techical aspect of film and storytelling.  I had grown a deeper apprecation for my own faith.

I could honestly go on and on about why I love this film but Im writing this review because if you are reading this and still haven't seen it, you absolutely must.  Take some time one day, and focus your attention on this movie because it doesn't demand it.  It doesn't gI've you action every few minutes, it doesn't bombard you with religious speeches and proclamations.  But if you give it your attention you are rewarded.

In conclusion, I'm not saying this is the best film ever made.  Not at all.  But it has done something that to date no other film has done for me.  Everyone will react to thus film in a unique way, but each and every one of them that givs it their attention will think, and have a thoughtful response to it, positive or negative.  For that reason I feel everyone should watch this film. And for that reason it still stands as my favorite film of all time.",1519862400,,5964,4.383075523202912

I was bummed out when the disc arrived with the front sign saying ""redeem digital copy before 12/31/2017"". I was 2 weeks too late! Bummer! So I thought. I contacted Amazon support, supposedly they will replace another disc with an ""eligible"" redeemable code. Well, the replacement arrived, and the expiration date is the same ""12/31/2017"". I don't blame Amazon, it's something I already suspected since the movie has been made available for quite a few years now, it's studio's business decision. I accepted the fact that I won't get the digital copy of this movie, but tried the digital redeeming process anyways, guess what? Fox's website didn't refuse my code and added the digital copy to my account! That's a good surprise! However, the digital copy I got was a bit let down (hence 4 stars), as it is only available in ""measly"" 1080p resolution without any bells and whistles. I'm saying this in comparison to other digital copies I've redeem from UHD blu rays, say ""mad max"", ""pacific rim"", those titles grant you UHD resolution digital copy with Dolby Vision picture quality, even higher than standard HDR10 on the physical UHD blu ray disc.",1516147200,,1276,4.778280542986425

Despite this not being a ""true"" 4k but in fact up scaled from a 2k intermediate, the sharpness in some of the interview scenes was nothing short of incredible. I suspect any scenes without CGI elements may actually be true 4k. This movie really demonstrates how HDR can improve colors even at a static brightness level. Everything looks incredibly lifelike and ""real"" looking. This film truly demonstrates what 4k can do. Comparing the bluray and 4k version side by side, I could not put my finger on the exact differences. The best way to describe is the difference between looking at an image vs seeing it with your own eyes in real life. The HDR version has this brutally ""real"" look to it that is impossible to describe without seeing it yourself. This incredible story of a man lost at sea really benefits from the added realism. This movie is highly recommended for anyone with a 4k TV. Even on my budget range 70"" vizio E-series, the benefits over bluray are clearly evident.",1513209600,9,1018,4.661111111111111

Either way, it's a great movie and for the price, especially as a not too old movie released in theaters a few years ago or less on blu-ray, the price was a steal. Not many blu-ray movies are $6.

4768916,5,B005LAIII0,"I really like this movie, even though half my family does not.

I primarily bought this for the Digital copy (to add to my VUDU Library), the DVD & Blu-Ray are just extras.  I was very impressed that even though the Digital copy date had expired with the set I received, my VUDU took it and added to my Library (along with the extras) without any issue.

The one negative I wish to mention:  I got this for $7.50, brand new unopened from a private party.  It's a shame that Amazon Prime (or VUDU) doesn't offer just the digital version of older movies like this for a decent price. Both of them had this for $19 just for the digital version. That's ridiculous, especially when I got the DVD/Blu-Ray/Digital for under $10.

(Update: Amazon Prime now has it for $9.99 to purchase, or $3.99 to rent.  VUDU is $13.99 and $2.99 respectively)  Also Walmart now has the DVD/Blu-Ray/Digital collectors edition for $9.49.

This movie's use of color and dark to light is beyond what most movies look like.

I sat on Argo and 12 years a Slave up until a few days ago.  Both were really good so I watched this one last night.

4769602,1,B005LAIII0,"The film itself is rated PG primarily for the action sequences in the film and the thematic premise of the protagonist being alone on a life boat with a 450-pound tiger ready to eat him for dinner. There are a handful of minor hells and damns, but other than that the film is non-objectionable to most general audiences.
An aspect of the story that some Christian audiences may find troubling is how the film deals with religion and faith, which play a key role in the story. In the course of events leading up to Pi and his family finding themselves on an ocean liner traveling from India to Canada, Pi is on a journey himself, one to find religious truth. In his quest he researches Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity and finds himself identifying with aspects from all three major religions.  The film does not take a particular stance as to which religion is best or bring Pi what he is searching for, but the role of God, capital G, plays a major part in Pis adventure.
Pi is born a Hindu, but as a child is introduced to Christianity (via Roman Catholicism which is not true Christianity) and Islam, and starts to follow all three religions, as he just wants to love god. He is trying to understand God through each religion. This is the book authors way of looking at religion, and it is promoted in the film. Are there truly many ways to God? Are all religions basically the same, as some claim? No.
The movie was very disheartening and dangerous for this reason: I would never want my children or anyone I love to think they can just choose whatever god they think will suit what they want in this life. The God who made man and who lovingly teaches that we are to acknowledge Him as the ONLY true God is the God who demands us not to worship any other god. It is understood that Hinduism can embarce many gods to the angst of those who know what is truth. It is also understandable for a person raised as a Hindu to not know the truth. That is where the Christian can help them and challenge them with the truth.

Ask any converted Hindu who knows Jesus, and they will tell you without hesitation that He alone is God whose power is far above all the powers of the gods they once believed in. Ask Rabi R. Maharaj who wrote Death of a Guru. His story is a fascinating story of the supernatural evil he experienced in following his father's life example of a Guru who experiences what living according to the Hindu religion results in. Mr. Maharaj is respectful and loving toward those who are of the Hindu religion knowing well the lies they believe and the power of those lies, but rejoicing in his knowledge of JESUS CHRIST who rescued him from the supernatural misery of the life of a Guru and the false teaching of Hinduism.

Truth exposing the lie is what makes good storiesstories of knowing Who God isgood and loving toward all He has made and wanting them to know what is truth so they will be saved from the destruction that man is born into. Only those who follow the Truth have the hope of eteranl life. That is how important it is for us to know truth. That is why this movie was very offensive. It has the potential of keeping people in the darkness of the lies they believe. It seems like such a nice story, and if a false premise of religion had not been so prominent in itit would have been ok.

Positive
1. PositiveThis beautiful film demands serious attention, as it is about God and a search for God, and is clearly set up allegorically. The young hero Pi in fact seeks to embrace Hindu, Christian and Islamic faiths, as well as his familys secular modernity. While this may upset some American Christians, the Christian priest in the film does a good job modeling Christian love while explaining some challenging doctrines. Director Ang Lee left out a scene from the book where Pi encounters clerics from all three faiths at once, and all three act competitive and petty. The main part of the story finds Pi on the lifeboat, with attached jerry built raft, with four surviving zoo animals, soon reduced to one large dangerous tiger, in a scary but often magical sea that delivers rescuing food and land at the most necessary moments.

Allegories abound as Pi confronts himself, the Tiger and God, in a kind of Indian Pilgrims Progress, but what does it all mean? (or as the survivor Pi says, does it have to mean anything?) What about tiger and Pis relationship with it, his training it, his inability to kill it when it is vulnerable, his giving it food and water, taking its head in his lap, his thanking it and his fear of it for his survival, his feelings of sadness when it goes into the jungle after their rescue. What about the fantasy island with its false feelings of long term rescue? What about the dark alternative story he tells the investigators? Why is the interviewing author in the movie at all? What does it mean when the author chooses which is the best story, and Pi says so it is with God?

This is a film that demands serious attention, and hopefully its many Indian cultural aspects will not get in the way.

PositiveI will admit, this was a hard movie to watch, one because it started off really slow before it got to the graphics, and two because of how intense it was with the animals fighting for their lives. No, I certainly do not like movies that talk about other religions, however that is a reality of our world. At least they even talked about Christ, which might make Hindus that watch this think about Him, too. I was really glad they did talk about Christ, even though they did not point it out as the only way to heaven, of course, they are not going to, this was not a Christian movie. The graphics were amazing, and the story kept you intrigued. This is NOT a movie for children, for the scenes with the tiger are very intense and scary, until they become friends. Overall, it was a pretty good movie, suspense was good, it was funny at times, and the graphics were awesome.

Samantha, age 38 (USA)
PositiveI loved it. Im a Christian, and I saw nothing offensive in the films respectful approach to religious faith. We can be secure enough in our own beliefs to allow the existence and exploration of other faiths. I personally find Christians that knock anything other than their own specific views very off-putting. Pi was a lovely young man on his own journey. It was visually beautiful, and it is great to see modern movies exploring spiritual and religious themes. It was a stunning and thoughtful movie, and, again, it is not meant to promote Christianity, but to tell a story and to explore the nature of faith.

Debbie, age 54 (USA)
PositiveFull of symbolism, the harsh ravages of loss, survival, animals eating each other and human death, and with a mix of faith suitable only for the mature mind, this is not really a movie for children. I took my 14 year old to see it, and, at first, she could only see the beauty of the visual aspects of the movie, and the sadness of the losses and difficulties. However, it also opened a gateway to some more in depth discussions about truth, faith, and the struggles of comprehending or believing what we have not experienced for ourselves, or at least as part of our human lives.

I was glad I didn't take my 11 and 8 year olds, as it would have given them nightmares, at best, and confused them on their own journeys of faith, at worst. Although, in their simple childlike faith, they may have just come away asking why Pi couldn't understand that Christs death for us meant he didn't need to worry about reaching out to God through other religions. more

Ruth, age 33 (Australia)
PositiveI think this was an excellent and gripping film and worthwhile seeing for older children, teenagers and adults. Most of all, it is about a young Hindu boys spiritual journey, and for me the main theme is how he grew to give complete surrender to God for control of his present and future. There is a wonderful balance of humour with the tragedy and suspense in the film. The joke about his name is slightly vulgar, but funny all the same, and so typical of some little boys. I totally understand some peoples concerns about the different religions mentioned, and there is a slight leaning toward the idea that all religions are equal. However, as his father says in the movieyou have to choose one road and to choose all of them is to have nothing!

I prefer to concentrate on the positive Christian references contained in the film. These include Pi saying that he found Christ, the priest quotes John 3:16, Pi is shown praying and seems to pray to accept Christ, he says grace before every meal and says amen, mention is made of Jesus Sacrifice and how He died for the sins of many when He had not sinned, the fact that he refers to himself as Catholic first, and his request to be baptized. The way I take it is that he still has his East Indian culture, but identifies himself as a Christian. more

PositiveLet me warn the reader that this brief review contains a major spoiler and should be avoided by anyone who did not read the book and intends to see the film. First off, I am not a Christian; I am an atheist. A wager is made in the film that after you hear Pis story you will believe in God. Pi, now a grown man, tells his story to a young novelist: how as a teenager he survived on the ocean in a lifeboat with a hungry, aggressive, man-eating tiger. It is a story full of beauty and near miraculous occurrences. ***SPOILER*** But at the end of the story, Pi is forced to tell another version of the tale, darker, harsher, shockinga version that, upon reflection, is obviously the true one. A question is then presented to the viewer: which story do you prefer. ***END SPOILER*** Like the young interviewer, I too chose the wonderful one, the miraculous one, the God story. And that is the power of this film.

John Calendo, age 65 (USA)
PositiveI loved this movie, both visually and spiritually. I think it was amazing that, out of all the references to other beliefs, it was very clearly stated, as Pi asked, why would a man die for our sins, and the Catholic Priest makes it clear, and the gospel has gone out to millions by that one scene.

Pi is on a journey, and his family were not faithful Hindus, nor did Pi go very far in his Muslim belief; he just wanted to know God. And since he was a child, he approached it in a childlike manner, and he met God.

I think the movie doesnt go deeply into any belief system vs. Christianity, but clearly tells the gospel message to every viewer that is something to be thankful for, and, for that, I am grateful to the writers.

And, of course, the movie is a wonder for the eyes, BUT TOO INTENSE for small children; it is after all a life and death journey! And Pi asks many hard questions to God, while facing death.

PositiveI took the time to read just about all the reviews. It is unfortunate how so many people do not know how to distill the meaning from a story. From the standards many apply to movies, the Bible would be unacceptable reading. To the movie. Was the second explanation of his voyage the true one? Unless one wants to completely ignore what happened during the storm and sinking of the ship where his mother was trapped below decks, then the second story was impossible.

Secondly, the movie made quite clear that Pi chose Christianity, evidenced by his request to be baptized. Interestingly, Pi still honored and respected his father (an atheist) which both Hinduism and Islam would struggle to do. There are so many aspects to this movie which reflect the true nature of our Lord.

Given the opportunity to kill his dangerous enemy, Pi chose instead to live with, care for and ultimately to save. The various scenes and story points demonstrated the sanctification process, the guidance of the Holy Spirit (telling him to leave the floating island) and the providence of God (throwing fish at and into his boat), just to mention a few. more

NeutralAfter watching the Life of Pi last night, the question arose would I let my brothers kids watch the film? the movie was good, it showed strength and courage and the human potential of survival when faced with life threatening situations. It also brought out the fact of the Bible that animals can be trained or tamed. It also shows the mercy of God in that He provides protection and safety for mankind when in need. For the Bible says that God sends rain on the just and the Unjust that His tender mercies are new each day. Pi does thank God for the miracle of providing fish, and landing at the swamp for a couple days of rest, before going back to the ocean. God is not a respecter of people. Hindu, Muslim, or Christian God mercy goes forth day to day and His provision to all His creation.

However, that does not mean that God receives the worship of all 3 religions. The Bible is clear that only those who place their faith in Christ will receive forgiveness of sins and eternal life On the bad side of this film some serious questions were raised about faith and also wrong answers were given about the Christian faith. more

Brandon, age 37 (USA)
NeutralIt is not uncommon for a Hollywood produced movie to question spirituality, the existence of God, and supremacy of religion, but rarely are these doubts projected in such a powerful way as they are in Ang Lees Life of Pi. The Oscar winning film is based on Yann Martels 2001 novel of the same name. The movie centers around a 17-year old Indian boy named Piscine Molitor Pi Patel, the son of a zookeeper, who survives a shipwreck aboard a lifeboat with a Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker.

Prior to the shipwreck, Pi, who was raised Hindu by his mother, had experimented with both Christianity and Islam. Pi discovers Christianity and Islam and incorporates the philosophies of these faiths into his Hindu lifestyle, culture, and spiritual pursuit. For example, in his prayers, Pi thanks Krishna for the salvation and sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Pis father, who has thoroughly rejected any religion, thinks that Pi is ridiculous and actually says something that seems to make the most sense of anything in the movie. Pis father tells him, Believing in everything at the same time is the same as believing in nothing at all. more

NegativeThough this movie has some of the most awesome scenes Ive seen in a movie, not unlike a lot of Indian/Bollywood films, which love creation and spiritual things, still I wasn't expecting such a aggressive attempt at teaching Indian/Eastern religion. After the film watered down the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ by making it another option and putting it on equal terms with Hinduism, Islam and maybe some others, I knew I had to give a heads up here for those concerned with spending money on films like this. I don't mean just a passing comment, but about a 30 minute presentation designed to leave a strong impression.

I don't have a problem dealing with strong issues, and we want to and do, but Im just saying I wasn't expecting this from what I saw from the trailer and from reviews. I thought it was just stunning scenery with a boy and tiger shipwrecked out to sea. Maybe sites like this are having an impact so much that they have to hide what the film is really about by making the movie seem like something else in the previews.

But I want to take this negative and turn it into a positive, and maybe youll join me. Movies are a great pastime when they are good. But Ive been meaning to make more of an effort to do other things for pastime, especially considering how much I spend on movies, sometimes. Things like going to a local ball game (high school, college, professional), concert and plays, some restaurants Ive been meaning to visit, events of interest (cultural, arts, history, science, games, , etc.), take a short trip to explore somewhere I haven't been, take my telescope out and go to the mountains or desert, go to the gym and play basketball/volleyball, go over to some friends or families house for a visit (hmmm, maybe that shouldnt be last). Pretty much just start living life more actively, instead of just watching it on film. Make your/my movie great(er) !!

NegativeI agree with much of whats written above, both positive and negative. Visually, the movie is stunning, at times, and some of the action sequences are riveting. However, the negatives outweigh the positives, in my judgment. One of my biggest concerns with the movie as a whole is that its rated PG. These days this usually means bring your small children, even though only G is supposed to mean that. My teenagers are able to see the attempt to portray all religions as a legitimate path to God as derisively ludicrous, but small children may not. While not portrayed visually, the actions discussed by the main character at the end are grossly brutal and completely unfit for children. Be warned.

No problem with the quality, but the whole premise of this film is in question. There was plenty of adventure and danger, but the whole story became contrived and unbelievable.

NegativePlease do not waste your money or time on the popular movie the Life of Pi; and certainly DO NOT take your children to see it! I went to see it because many said it was a spiritual movie. While the movie was cinematically beautiful to watch (at times), it was mostly preachy, depressing and too violent for children. As for its spiritual aspects; the movie was more of the same all religions are from God ya dah ya dah that we have all heard from ignorant people who have made a shallow attempt at religion. But more sadly, while this movie sent the message that all religions are legit ways to God, in reality they are all just human fantasy. Life is cruel and religion is just a coping mechanism and thats OKAY. Whatever gets you by in this horrible life. I personally think the writer had a lot of bitterness against God and this was a jab at Him for allowing such cruelty. But that is natural for people who only relate to this world.

Indeed, it is a cruel world! But Jesus Kingdom is NOT of this cruel world, and never will be. This world is cursed and the only true remedy is to KNOW Jesus. Then we are to keep our eyes and hearts on Him and His heavenly Kingdom. Indeed, Jesus can be as Noahs Arch during a flood. He can even prepare a lush banquet (table) before us in the presence of our enemies. We just have to stay in His Spirit! Otherwise, we too can become bitter as this life can truly deal us some severe blows! My Ratings: Moral rating: Extremely Offensive / Moviemaking quality: 5

To all those who gave it a positive rating, let me say thisNo matter how entertaining and appealing and humorous it may be, The Life of Pi is spun around one big lie of the devil.

Demitri, age 44 (South Africa)
NegativeI was highly disappointed by previous Christian reviews of this movie. They left me unprepared for its real message. This movie comes out strongly and condescendingly atheist. Moreover, it is armed with really effective writing and imagery. The author takes us through a very meaningful portrayal of suffering and the wonder of life, by a man who claims to be syncretistic. I say claims, because, in the end, he admits that the meaning and wonder are merely a farce and that his atheistic father was right all along. All faiths are just stories that men prefer to the truth, because the truth makes no sense of their suffering.

The movie was powerfully done, but that makes it more offensive, in my book, since the emotional imprint of such storytelling can do significant damage to any mind, but especially that of the young and impressionable. If you do watch it with your family, just be prepared to discuss this ubiquitous Hollywood message: God is a fantasy for the weak who need comfort. Science is the only truth.

Comments from young people
NeutralI saw the Life if Pi with my friend and did not like the movie too much. First, I thought it was a little strange that Pi followed 3 religions. I am a Christian so remembered during the movie God is the only God. Second, some scenes may be intense for young children. For example, in the beginning Pis dad feeds a baby goat to Richard Parker, (tiger). He does this to teach Pi how vicious the tiger really is. Pi learns from this but is scarred for life. Another example is when Pi stranded the ocean and a hyena kills a zebra and gorilla. The fill is not overly graphic, but does show blood. Overall, young viewers may find this film a little strange or frightening at some points.

4770431,5,B005LAIII0,"Life of Pi
  I admit that I had my doubts about Life of Pi.  All I knew from the trailers was that a teenager gets trapped on a life boat in the middle of the ocean with a hungry tiger-and survives!  This seemed to be the acme of improbability.  I have seen the Animal Planet shows on TV and I know that a skinny Indian teenager is no match for a Bengal Tiger in his prime.
 I was very pleasantly surprised.  The life boat sequences are just on the near edge of possibility, so far as survival is concerned.  The kid is clever and badly wants to survive.  Never give up is a good message for all of us.  Suraj Sharma is the young Indian actor who plays the teenager.  He is also shown as a boy and as an adult by other actors, but Sharma holds the film together.
 It is much too simple to say that Life of Pi is a shipwreck movie.  It is more to do with the elastic nature of reality, the astonishing ability of the human mind to protect itself and even about the nature of our relationship with God than it is a simple shipwreck film.  I found that on this level the film is entirely satisfactory and worth the admission price.
 But there is more.  This is a film produced and directed by Ang Lee.  Lee amazed us a few years ago with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  He amazes us again with Life of Pi.  Writer David Magee (Finding Neverland 2004) gives us a coherent and inventive script which is great.  With this subject we might have drifted into absurdity quite easily.
 But cinematographer Claudio Miranda gives us incredible, magical images to delight our eyes and to cause our senses to soar.  Chilean born Miranda was nominated for an Academy Award for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.  Some may have seen his work in the 2010 Tron: Legacy.  Miranda has created for us images of astonishing beauty.  There is one night-time scene where a whale broaches through a sea of tropical phosphorescence that is beyond description.  And this is not the only magical moment, not by a long shot.
 What a wonderful world it is where people of such talent have a way to share it with those of us who simply provide an audience.  This PG rated film runs two delightful hours and six minutes.  Producer Ang Lee worked with a budget of 120 million well spent dollars.  Thus far the film has garnered only $108 million.  I hope Ang Lee and Claudio Miranda will not be discouraged.",1479686400,,2377,4.358447488584475
4770432,5,B005LAIII0,"Incredible movie that is one of the most beautiful I've seen in a long time.

4770508,5,B005LAIII0,"You will be unable to forget this movie--ever..  It is a story  of shipwreck
and survival in Nature that is both ruthlessly hostile and equally beautiful by turns.
Suraj Sharma is an incredibly attractive teenager whose spiritual character is
glimpsed through his earlier childhood and his closely-knit  family in India.  Suraj
embodies universal values as he stumbles across the enlightenment offered by
various religions, Hindu, Muslim, Christian.
Having decided to leave India for Canada, the family embarks on
 an old Japanese freighter with the animals from their zoo.  Hoping to start a new life,
their lives are ended in a typhoon.  Only Suraj survives, in part, because of his curiosity
about nature. The epic, lonely journey of this young man as a captive of the Pacific Ocean,
 subject to its whims,  reveals and develops his hidden strengths and weaknesses.
 The ingenuity and faith of this boy, forced into early manhood, aided by
a lot of luck or fate enable him to survive many threats to his survival.
An inspiring story of a modern Robinson Crusoe in exotic settings,
enhanced by incredibly beautiful photography that makes Nature
a leading character as well.",1479254400,20,1175,5.104712041884817

It was gripping to the point of viewer exhaustion, and just when I thought I understood, then came a punch to the gut. Pretty manipulative, but in a good way. This is so well done, the two main actors who play Pi are magnificent, and well ... this movie taught me something about myself that had me reeling (no pun intended) for days. I don't care how corny that sounds. And then there's the rich visual aspect of it: Not only is it just plain pretty, but I think the cinematography and special effects helped with the distraction that was necessary for the storyline to be as effective as it was.

4771499,5,B005LAIII0,"Please understand...I am not rating what I think of the MOVIE, because that is strictly subjective. Frankly, you could care less about if I liked the movie or not, at least I hope that is the case. What I am rating here is the QUALITY of the movie in 4K. You must have a 4K Blu-Ray player to play the 4K version of this movie, which is why I paid the extra cash for the disc. (Someday, I'm sure they will all drop in price when something else takes the place of 4K, at least I hope so!) do not be confused, my player does upscale non-4K discs to ""near"" 4K quality, but it also plays 4K discs. If you have a regular Blu-Ray player, it will not play this disc, so save yourself the cash and buy a Blu-Ray version. Anyway, I digress. The 4K quality of this movie played on my Samsung UBD-K8500 Ultra HD player is phenomenal. I own a Samsung Ulta HD TV model KS8000 TV, and the resolution is spectacular. You can see even the minutest fragment of details in scenes, down to the strands of hair on the character's heads. It is as if you are living the scene, not merely watching it passively. The experience is well worth the money you will pay for the 4K version of his film. In my opinion, it beat the resolution that I saw it in at my local theater, and to be honest, I doubt my local theater has 4K resolution, but my experience has been that theaters make up for picture quality by boosting the sound extremely loudly instead in order to try to make you immerse yourself in the action. I can honestly say that this 4K movie played in its highest definition will immerse you without a doubt! Happy viewing!",1468972800,4,1605,4.231270358306189

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!

A remarkable work.  Gonna see if I can re-start the movie near the front before the Amazon rental 48 hour limit expires and watch it again.  Might even pay the extra four bucks if I fail.  Wanna use the ol' lady's bigger screen this time.

Even though there is limited 4k content available on blu-ray, I purchased movies I already owned. I've watched 4 4k UHD blu-rays to date (Deadpool, Mad Max Fury Road, The Martian, and Ender's Game) and while they are better they didn't seem to me any better than the upscaling that the 4K blu-ray player (Samsung - K8500) did on its own with regular bu-rays. That all changed with ""The Life of Pi"". This movie/disc had everything I was looking for in 4k. It is full screen (no letterbox/black bars) and the clarity and picture is amazing. This is what I expected from 4k and the combination of a 4K TV, the 4K blu-ray player and this movie is movie magic.

4772520,5,B005LAIII0,"Common Sense Media says ""Parents need to know that Life of Pi is an intense, emotional story of survival and triumph against the odds, with themes of faith, friendship, and perseverance. Although it's rated PG, and there's virtually no strong language, sexual content, or blood, this adaptation of Yann Martel's bestselling novel has several very harrowing (especially in 3-D) scenes of storms, shipwrecks, the possibility of implied cannibalism, and zoo animals threatening humans and confronting, killing, and eating each other -- all of which are likely to be too much for younger children (as are the themes of allegory and mysticism, which will require thoughtful parental explanation). Pi is in near-constant peril throughout the story (though it's told as a flashback, so you know he'll survive) and, after losing his whole family, he must negotiate sharing a very small space with a large, unpredictable tiger (one of Pi's tactics involves peeing on part of the lifeboat they share). But through it all, he remains determined and optimistic, relying on his strong faith to see him through every challenge he must face. """,1462752000,,1128,5.2032967032967035

This is a question we often asks of our own lives. When we remember the past, we prefer to remember the story we prefer,  and not necessarily the story as was.

In my view, this is not an entertaining movie, but a movie about spiritualism. It is also a movie about the spiritual culture in India.

Virtually, every major religious (including atheism) thoughts are represented in this film.

If you are looking for a thought provoking movie, then I recommend this film.

Pros:
1)Spiritual in its content and visualizations.
2)Asks meaningful question about life and ourselves.
3)Not about sex, money, power, and violence. It is the opposite.

Cons:
1)I couldn't totally understand what the actors were saying. Yes, the movie tried to be authentic by using Indian actors with heavy accents, but trying to to decipher their thick accents also took some effort on my part.",1459036800,,943,4.8930817610062896

A lot of the releases are going this way - I know there is no 3D 4K - that is not in the cards - but they could at least include the 3D version - especially - if like a handful of films - it was actually intended that way.  (THE MARTIAN, HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON, LEGGO MOVIE) - movies that live in 3D should be in the package.  Am I wrong about this?  Is 3D on the way out or will early 3D adopters be punished for having TVS and PLAYERS that play the actual 3D FORMAT.",1456444800,2,655,3.8222222222222224

It is an excellent story, well-told, and very thought provoking. The movie shares the same qualities. It was difficult for me to watch for the intensity of the feelings it evokes. It is not ""graphic"" (i.e. ""gory"")  but depends on arousing feelings that some films try to do by being overly graphic, telegraphic, simplistic, etc. This film does not do this but lets good acting and fantastic special effects do that.

4773946,5,B005LAIII0,"This is a great film. I considered giving it four stars because it is not perfect. The scene on the island of the meerkats is unnecessary and flawed, because meerkats live in Africa, not on floating islands (there are no floating islands) in the Pacific. The special effects are good but not perfect, but as technology advances, we demand higher standards. We should not wonder why animals stowed in the hold of a sinking ship survive, while humans on upper decks all perish. We should not dive too deeply into the symbolism of a man and a tiger trying to survive in a lifeboat. Just enjoy it. Some of the one-liners made me laugh aloud. In my book, that's enough for five stars.",1447545600,,679,4.528455284552845

4774296,5,B005LAIII0,"This is a beautiful story about a young man travelling to Canada on a ship from India with his family and a cargo of exotic zoo animals, when the ship sinks in a catastrophic storm. Suraj Shama plays Pi, a youngster who grew up in India with his family, living in a park full of their animals. The family is well to do, but after the city council decides to take back the park and evict them, the two boys and their parents must travel to Canada with their animals to start a new life.

After the storm Pi is left in a boat by himself, where he's eventually joined by four other animals of various species, and each animal adds an element to the story. Pi goes through many trials and nearly starves, while stuck in the lifeboat. His biggest nemesis is the Tiger, who swam to the lifeboat and made the journey with Pi. In the beginning Pi had was scared of the tiger then eventually mastered him and trained the tiger to a point.

Pi goes through so many trials and learning experiences while trying to survive the journey, and they all tie together and make sense in the end.

This movie is very beautifully made, the story and acting are superb, and the lessons learned will bring tears to your eyes. What an experience. We were so moved we bought the Blu-ray DVD.

Highly recommended",1443225600,8,1286,4.368200836820083

4774411,5,B005LAIII0,"I finally had a chance to watch Life of Pi in 3D. This film is definitely a must-see experience in 3D.

Be warned, the aspect ratio will change twice during the film on certain scenes - THIS IS NORMAL. Although if you're not forewarned, you will find it odd and annoying when it changes, not knowing the story behind it. The director purposely wanted to play/change the aspect ratio (CinemaScope) during the film (it has nothing to do with IMAX conversion) - you will get black bars; the director did this so that the fishes go out into the black borders, making it seem like they're popping out of the screen. This film was meant to be seen in 3D.

Visually, the 3D and cinematography is impressive. But it doesn't just end there.

I've been collecting 3D films lately, and I haven't had a film that made me jump yet UNTIL THIS ONE. The scene where the tiger first lashes out in the boat literally made me jump; surround sound also helps! Very intense.

The flying fishes was also an exciting 3D scene.

This is a film that makes you think on deeper levels. It does involve religion and faith, but I love how the film brings that full circle and importance in the movie regardless what religion or non-religious you are.

Are you a realist rational thinker or a believer? I love how this film challenges and questions those ideas.

The actors are excellent, both young and older Pi. I really felt for the characters. Even the CG tiger is so lovable... Richard Parker.

It's an excellent must-see touching film, an unforgettable 3D experience that goes beyond just superficial 3D. The 3D completely enhances the film.

For me, Avatar is just to show off 3D with the most generic cliche storyline. Life of Pi uses 3D to enhance a deep philosophical touching story. The film Gravity has impressive 3D, but the story just isn't there for that either. Life of Pi is the complete package 3D/storyline.

If you want a film open to many discussions, this is it.",1441756800,,1954,4.573065902578796

4775787,5,B005LAIII0,"Wow. If you are looking to see a movie that is not only visually stunning but will leave the viewer feeling amazed this is a good movie for the entire family. There are scenes that might not be appropriate for small children to watch alone. (My opinion as a mother of 4 and grandmother of 2.) But those scenes with the animals are very well done and easily understandable to anyone who is paying attention to what is going on in the story line. And there is a moral at the end of the movie. And no, the moral is not: never get in a boat with a tiger! How anyone could survive the things that happen to our hero, Pi, and still have a positive happy life afterwards makes for an uplifting story. And we all want our kids to learn that sometimes things happen to us that we can not control but will survive and be better than ok. I do feel that if you have the option of reading the book with the same title, it is a better choice because the reader uses their imagination! Don't get me wrong, this movie is just beautiful to see especially the scenes where Pi is floating at night in the sea w a whale near by. I bought it in Blu ray which is a little more, but totally worth the cost. Life of Pi the movie is wonderful.",1433980800,6,1218,4.079166666666667

Andrews 3D Blu-ray Review: Director Ang Lee brings Yann Martel's unfilmable Booker Prize-winning novel LIFE OF PI to the screen with dazzling effect. Suraj Sharma stars as Pi Patel, a 16 year-old zookeeper's son from Pondicherry, who finds himself stranded on a small boat in the Pacific Ocean in the company of a Bengal tiger following the shipwreck of the freighter on which he and his family were sailing for Canada. Over the course of several months Pi manages to survive on the meagre supplies of food and water he finds on the boat, and also takes up fishing, while in his half-delirious state he muses on various aspects of animal behaviour, religion and the meaning of life.

The Taiwan-born Ang Lee rapidly established himself in the 1990s as one of the world's most versatile film-makers, moving on from the trilogy of movies about Chinese families that made his name to Jane Austen's England Sense and Sensibility and Richard Nixon's America The Ice Storm. He adopts different styles to fit his new subjects, and while there are certain recurrent themes, among them the disruption of families and young people facing moral and physical challenges, there are no obsessive concerns of the sort once considered a necessity for auteurs. He has a fastidious eye for a great image but he also has a concern for language.

His stunning magnificent 3D film is adapted from the Yann Martel's Booker prize-winning novel Life of Pi which was finally adapted for screenplay by the American writer David Magee, whose previous credits were films set in England during the first half of the 20th century, Finding Neverland and Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day. From its opening scene of animals and birds strutting and preening themselves in a sunlit zoo to the final credits of fish and nautical objects shimmering beneath the sea, the movie has a sense of the mysterious, the magical. This effect is compounded by the hallucinatory 3D, which is awesome, compared to when I went to the cinema to see it in 3D and I was not very impressed, where this 3D Blu-ray is out of this world and is so lifelike seeing via the 3D Blu-ray.

The form of the film is a story within a story within a story. An unnamed Canadian author whom we assume to be Yann Martel himself [Rafe Spall] who I thought had a most aggravating Canadian accent and why couldn't they have got a Canadian actor to do this part? Anyway we find Rafe Spall with the adult Pi Patel [Irrfan Khan] in his Montreal home, who has a story that will make you believe in God. Piscine Molitor Patel [Irrfan Khan], a philosophy teacher and he tells the curious story of his own extraordinary life, beginning as the son of a zookeeper in Pondicherry, the French enclave in India that wasn't ceded until 1954.

The film's two central characters both obtained their names by comic accident. The deeply serious Piscine (played by Gautam Belur at five, Ayush Tandon at 12 and Suraj Sharma at 16) was named after an uncle's favourite swimming pool, the Piscine Molitor in Paris, but changed his name to the Greek letter and numinous number Pi after fellow schoolboys made jokes about constantly going to the toilet. He later became fascinated by a Bengal tiger in the zoo caught by the English hunter Richard Parker who called him Thirsty. On delivery to the zoo their names were accidently reversed and the tiger became Richard Parker. Was this fate or by chance?

Growing up, the ever curious Pi Patel becomes attracted to religion and the meaning of life, a spiritual journey that the film treats with a respectful wit as the boy rejects his father's rationalism and creates a personal amalgam of Hinduism, Christianity and Islam. His faith is tested as an adolescent when his father is forced to give up the family zoo, where Pi Patel realises he's been as much a captive as the animals themselves. A Japanese freighter becomes a temporary ark on which the Patel family take the animals to be sold in Canada. But it's struck by a storm as dramatic as anything ever put on the screen, and Pi Patel becomes a combination of Noah, Crusoe, Prospero and Job. Alone above the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the Pacific, he's an orphan captaining a lifeboat with only a zebra, a hyena, a female orang-utan and the gigantic Bengal tiger Richard Parker for company.

This is a grand adventure on a totally epic scale, a survival story that takes up half the film. It's no Peaceable Kingdom like Edward Hicks's charming early 19th-century painting, where the lion sleeps with the lamb. This is a Darwinian place that Pi Patel must learn to command. Using state-of-the-art 3D and digitally created beasts, Ang Lee and his team of technicians make it utterly real and totally perfect, as they do with the totally mysterious island that briefly provides a dangerously seductive haven.

The long arduous journey had Pi Patel 227 days at sea which tested his whole physique, mental adaptation and faith, and Suraj Sharma makes Pi Patel 's spiritual journey as convincing as his nautical one. He confronts thirst and starvation, finds a modus vivendi with the fierce tiger, endures and wonders at a mighty storm, a squadron of flying fish, a humpbacked whale, a school of dolphins, a night illuminated by luminous jellyfish. This brave new world is observed by a young Chilean director of photography, appropriately named Claudio Miranda. The spectacular film does for water and the sea what Lawrence of Arabia did for sand and desert, and one thinks of what Alfred Hitchock, who used 3D so imaginatively in his 1954 film of Dial M For Murder, might have done on his wartime Lifeboat had he been given such technical facilities.

LIFE OF PI is an exhilarating drama about the mysteries which light up our lives and have no rhyme or reason on their own; the faith that enables us to make a leap into the dark; the teachings of animals; the fierce and tranquil sides of nature; and the powerful instinct we all have for survival. This spiritually alluring film can bring you to a transformed appreciation for the baffling, curious, and inexplicable dimensions of life and the world around you. This poetic LIFE OF PI concludes with a fascinating, deliberately prosaic coda that raises questions about the reality of what we've seen and confronts the teleological issues involved.

3D Blu-ray Video Quality  LIFE OF PI is completely transformed into a finer, more immersive experience through the use of 3D. The sense of infinite depth in the horizon at sea is particularly superb, and underwater scenes take on a special magnificence with their openness and majesty in 3D especially when seen from underneath as fish and other creatures swim in different planes under the boat. The sense of space on that medium-sized lifeboat gains tremendously with the extra dimension added, and the scenes on Meerkat Island are likewise transformed into almost other-worldly experience stereoscopic images. As for the projections, they are wonderfully thought out from a hummingbird which flies before our eyes early on to sticks and poles which either protrude toward us or in point of view shots that seem to come from our own hands. In the flying fish scene, theres a magnificent moment as the screen ratio widens when a fish hits something in the frame and then flops out in front of the letterbox frame seemingly at our feet. There is absolutely no crosstalk at all in fashioning this magnificent 3D achievement.

3D Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound mix is all one could hope for in this kind of special effects extravaganza. Its tremendously expressive throughout with the wide, wide soundstage playing host to a variety of split surrounds and putting us right in the middle of a couple of hellacious sea storms that will give your audio equipment a major workout. Richard Parkers growls are wonderfully directional as he moves around the boat, and Mychael Dannas Oscar-winning score gets the full surround experience. Dialogue is always completely understandable and has been placed in the centre channel.

First 3D Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: With this particular 3D Blu-ray, you can view the extras in either 3D or 2D.

Deleted Scenes: Anandis Second Dance [3D/2D] [2012] [1080p] [16:9] [1:44]; Time to Grow Up [3D/2D] [2012] [1080p] [16:9] [2:08]; Happy Birthday [3D/2D] [2012] [1080p] [1.85:1/16:9] [2:48]; Did I Say Something Wrong [3D/2D] [2012] [1080p] [16:9] [2:22] and Darkness [3D/2D] [2012] [1080p] [16:9] [4:37]

Special Feature: VFX Progression: Tsimtsum Sinking [Shot Indicator] [3D/2D] [2012] [1080p] [16:9] [12:40] I personally felt this particular extra went on far too long and was well over the top. Tsimtsum Sinking which show elements from two scenes in plate form (raw footage), with animation added, and the final product.

Special Feature: The Wave Tank [3D/2D] [2012] [1080p] [16:9] [2:10] Here you get to see how the tank was built, and you get to see all the technical wizardry on how the CGI was produced for the finished film.

Theatrical Trailer [3D/2D] [2012] [1080p] [16:9] [2:12]

Second Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Feature Documentaries: A Filmmakers Epic Journey: Part 1: Life of Pi: A Filmmakers Epic Journey [2012] [1080p] [16:9] [15:05]; Part 2: Suraj Sharman: Audition Footage [2012] [480i/1080p] [4:3/16:9] [16:30]; Part 3: A Tigers Tale [2012] [1080p] [16:9] [17:43] and Part 4: Illusion of 3D [2012] [1080p] [16:9] [14:26] I cannot recommend these 4 brilliant documentaries enough, as they are so brilliantly photographed and gives you so much information on all who was involved in this awesome project of Life of Pi. It details the four year trek to the finished film concentrating on comments from director Ang Lee, film editor Tim Squyres, screenwriter David Magee, and others. The documentary (divided into four sections which can be pulled up separately) covers the preproduction work, the casting of Pi Patel and the training regimen for Suraj Sharma, the filming schedules in Taiwan and India, the working with real tigers and the CG work with computer-generated animals, continuity difficulties, solving the difficulties of using the specially constructed wave tank, the use of 3D for the film, and its triumphant premiere at the New York Film Festival.

Special Feature: A Remarkable Journey [2012] [1080p] [16:9] [19:37] This is a fascinating look at all aspects of the CGI effects and you learn so much of what was involved. These set pieces elaborate preparations for the special effects work done first in computer pre-visualisation and then adding layer upon layer to get to the finished product. Ang Lee, Tim Squyres, special effects supervisor Jean-Martin Desmarais, among others, provide primary commentary.

Special Feature: Tiger, Tiger Burning Bright [2012] [1080p] [16:9] [19:35] Here is another fascinating insight into how they trained the Bengal tigers and their reaction towards ""Pi"" Patel [Suraj Sharma]. You also get to see the fascinating insight on how they were able to create the CGI tiger from the real Bengal tiger. It also discusses the extraordinary CG work that went into fashioning a photo-realistic tiger to play Richard Parker in the film, especially with lots of side-by-side comparisons between the real tiger used for reference in the lifeboat set with the computer-generated one that appears in the frame with actor Suraj Sharma.

Special Feature: Art Gallery [2012] [1080p] [7:28] The following section is composed of a series of still images. You can either select AUTO ADVANCE to launch the slide show, where images change every five seconds. But if you select MANUAL ADVANCE, you can step through the images individually. Press TOP MENU on your remote control to go back to the Top Menu. The art you get to view are by Joanna Bush; Haan Lee; Dawn Masi and Alex Rockman. You get to view a total of 90 images and the best of the bunch is by Joanna Bush, which are totally stunning.

Special Feature: Storyboards [2012] [1080p] [12:23] The following section is composed of a series of still images. You can either select AUTO ADVANCE to launch the slide show, where images change every five seconds. But if you select MANUAL ADVANCE, you can step through the images individually. Press TOP MENU on your remote control to go back to the Top Menu. There are 7 categories, which are as follows: Zoo Hospital; Ashram; Piscine Molitor; Floating festival; Cargo Hold; Underwater Fantasy and Mexican Beach.

The Blu-ray disc is BD-Live ready and contains one exclusive (and surprisingly important) feature not available on the Blu-ray disc: The Importance of Storytelling which details in 20 and 30 minutes of the adaptation of Yann Martels novel to the screen by screenwriter David Magee

Finally, after scoring four Academy Awards LIFE OF PI is attracting lots of attention on home video circuit, and it deserves it. While it may not be the life-changing experience that it wants to be, it is at least thought-provoking and sure to generate some post-viewing discussion, particularly if you watch it with others of differing worldviews. Besides that, it's simply gorgeous to behold and probably the best adaptation we could've asked for from a book previously considered as stated earlier that is was deemed ""unfilmable."" 20th Century Fox's Blu-ray release does justice to the film's eye-candy visuals, particularly if you go for the stunning awesome 3D version. Ang Lees LIFE OF PI was deservedly celebrated as one of the 2012s best film. The reference quality video images and the stunning audio experience, plus an amazing excellent array of bonus material, sure makes it a clear choice for you to purchase this 3 Disc Collectors Edition. Very Highly Recommended!

I can't really tell you what it is ""about"". The story is how Pi managed to survive a long time in a lifeboat with the added problem of a tiger in the boat with him. But what really happened. Did God give a miracle or two? Possibly yes. Was Pi hallucinating? Definitely, but when? Did the tiger ever seem to understand Pi? Definitely no. The tiger was a tiger, no more, no less from beginning to end. Did Pi learn from his ordeal? Definitely yes. But what exactly is harder to say.

They picked a really good lead actor as I thought he fit the role perfectly.  Everything relating to the story that is being told is just so wonderfully visually appealing.  The topics of loss and things we have to do in extraordinary situations to even how we reflect on our own life is presented in such a manner that I couldn't stop watching until the very end.

Life of Pi starts with the simple story of a family in search of a better life, but quickly becomes an epic tale of shipwreck survival with a Bengal tiger companion.  This film treads a similar fine line of fact, fiction and fairytale, all in the service of a very powerful moral, masquerading as a wickedly fun adventure.

Only in India could a boy become a muslim, a buddhist, and a catholic at the same time and feel no contradiction. This was a work of fiction, but when I read it, so convinced I was that this was real, it wasn't until Meercat Island that I had my doubts and looked it up on the internet. Fiction! I was duped and followed the story and bought it hook, line and sinker. My daughter took me to see the movie in 3D and I was not dissapointed! Yes, this book spoke to me on several levels and I will still probably read it twice a year forever, and the movie was awesome!

A young man who survives a disaster at sea is hurtled into an epic journey of adventure and discovery. While cast away, he forms an unexpected connection with another survivor a fearsome Bengal tiger.

What did I think?

Like a fine meal, Life Of Pi is better once you sit and reflect upon it. But theres a fine line between satisfied digestion and an unsettling feeling in your stomach. Visually, this film is majestic and the characterisation wonderful. In fact the early stages provide an unexpected depth and layering that was both thought-provoking and had me salivating for more.

And then it hit the second act with our protagonists adrift and the layering simply disappeared. And suddenly it became quite two-dimensional before two distinctly unexpected moments late in the film  one surreal and one TOO real  left your mind racing.

Only time and reflection will tell if it leaves you a little empty after a few hours or if the platter Ang Lee serves up fills you to the brim. Its probably not for everyone  and indeed will upset some  but its a thoughtful piece for hungry minds.",1423699200,,1106,4.7486910994764395

4778890,2,B005LAIII0,"I adore Indian people and their accents, the cinematography and visual effects are truly spectacular, and the soundtrack is beautiful too. So, I recommend it for those aspects. But the story is pretty weak.

Early on, you are told that the story you are about to hear will make you believe in God. In the end, they basically say ""see, now isn't it better to believe in God."" The only problem is that the story bases its assertion on a lie within the telling, basically saying ""it's good to believe in God even if you think God is a lie because it's a beautiful lie and isn't it great to believe in a beautiful lie."" If it sounds like a terribly constructed argument, that's because it is.

I get the impression that the author is a flower child who likes faith because it is pretty and makes you feel good while completely failing to consider the religion that comes with faith - what Christians might call 'lukewarm' - the kind of guy who goes to church on Christmas and Easter because it makes him feel warm and fuzzy but who never really observes the law of religion. The protagonist in the story does observe a tiny bit of religious law, like praying to the East when he discovers Islam, but the problem is that he claims to belong to three different religions at the same time, and he really only scratches the philosophical surface of each religion without seeming to truly commit to any of them.

Add to all of it that this is fiction. A story of survival and beating the odds which is supposed to make me believe in God should be true. Anybody can dream up a mind-blowing fantasy, but it won't have the same kind of impact that a true story carries. And it also weakens the impact to learn that the author of the novel got his idea from another novel.

I say this as an atheist who honestly hoped the movie would reveal something I hadn't thought of - perhaps a bit of Indian wisdom I'd never heard. But there is no wisdom to be found here. Just hippie truthiness.",1420329600,2,1972,4.379781420765028

4779271,5,B005LAIII0,"This film is absolutely brilliant simply in witnessing it on the screen before you (e.g., with the sound turned off), provided it is being broadcast from a good quality (the higher the resoluttion the better) HD TV. But somehow the film's true beauty is even more implicit in the message is it brings to us--an extremely critical lesson about how we must go about altering our consciousness so as to live our live's so as to restore ourselves to the absolute perfection, beauty, and infinite power and potential to create and manifest all that our heart's desire--but not form a greedy, ego-based expression of desire--rather, desire that flows from the within  deepest the deepest reaches of our hearts and souls to manifest our greatest potential of the expression of each perfect moment, as well as the culmination of, our experience on this human journey. And in so doing live we ultimately come to perpetually dwell within a state of consciousness that is ever-evolving, ever growing, and thereby ever more optimizing our quality of life.

Now just what is this profound lesson, and how could it be that the vast majority of Earth dwellers have forgotten who it is that we truly are, and thus have become thrououghly disempowered and consciously dwell in a chaotic never-never land? This is an essential and primary truth for us at this point--not only that we continue our existence perpetual beings of Light, but at this time  our Spirit is encased in what we refer to as a human body. And as such, we must not only attend to the nurturing and developing of our spiritual beingness, but we must also attend to the physical, mental, and emotional energies of the human elements of our beingness to truly attain health and wellness while residing on Mother Earth.

But these days we are taught crazed, egomaniacal, greedy, possessive, and self-seeking notions about how we should live our lives. Our Spirit essence, nor even the requirements for sustaining the health and wellness of our physical bodies, rarely enter into our conscious awareness, where all of these elements should be from and center.  Instead, most of us now live with a consciousness driven by the most elemental remnants of our monkey brains, with very contorted notions of what truly matters in life or which afford us with much of anything in the potential of our self-expression and optimal quality of loves.

The latter is achieved through the merging of the Spirit-based energies of our beingness into these spectacular and miraculous devices. And this is clearly how we are born even unto this day, each of us with a spirit-centered consciousness, the energies of which blossom and explode from any infant--we can see it in their eyes, we can sense it in their expression, we can feel it flowing from their beingness when we touch and hold them.

Unfortunately, it appears to have become our societies primary child-rearing function to cause our children to unlearn the energies and the qualities thereof we are all born with, and in its place we teach them these truly bizarre concepts of what it is our children should seek in life and what it is they should strive for. In fact what we teach, and the seem being what our society reinforces, are extremely warped and downright crazed notions of that life is truly about, about their infinite potential inherent in the free choice that Spirit grants us, and how each and every one of us are capable of creating the most spectacular reality we can possibly envision with our lives, and even more so. And that in so doing we live the most perfect, optimal quality of lives in total health and wellness at all times, and that in so doing we will also be gifting the world with the greatest gifts we have to offer it.

So as I was saying, the message of the film, is in revealing the essential experience we all must now process our lives through so as to restore our unity with our spiritual beingness, and from that reunification, that relearning process, to unveil the infinite hope and possibility that lie within us when we first set foot upon this Earth. And this process of unlearning, as the film so elegantly portrays, is only made possible by a powerful surrender; oftentimes surrender upon surrender until the beast within is fully released--which is a letting go of the egotistical attachments we have made that have completely distorted our world view and the infinite and perfect ways that way can experience and create ever more beauty in our world.

Yet as the film portrays, this process of surrender, of effecting a full and complete release of all that it is we are led to believe is of significance than stems from an ego-based existence, or ego-centered consciousness, can present as the greatest challenge of our lives in breaking through this deeply engrained mind/body mode of beingness. For one must bring forth every ounce of energy within their entire beingness to literally break down the walls that so severely restrict us from becoming who we were meant to be. For over time, these walls typically grow so thick and heavy, securing themselves in seemingly impenetrable ways through endless strings of tentacles that have grown deeply into every fiber of our beingness.

However, nothing in life comes close to the miraculous new world that awaits us when we arise to the level of courage it takes to effect this release. And it is only achieved through an unwavering focus, coupled with relentless energy, oftentimes seeming t require more energy than we have to give, that can effectively cause these chains that bind us to shatter, and this to be truly set free to be and become all that our heart's desire, and all that the world so longs to receive from us to release it from its suffering, and/r otherwise facilitate its healing processes.

4779338,3,B005LAIII0,"There are many elements of this film that make it worth watching. The visual effects are stunning, the story is interesting and well told, however I couldn't watch the film much past the shipwreck. The boy does everything wrong to survive, yet survives. Almost every decision he makes puts his life at risk. He does idiotic things like yell at an open sea for someone to help him when there is nobody in sight. And when he has opportunities to make good decisions he fails miserably. I can't watch films like that, because survival in a situation like what is portrayed in this story would require quick thinking, and making one good decision after another. I didn't find the character's idiotic behavior created any tension, if anything I was rooting for him to die. It's like watching a horror film where everyone is getting butchered and a remaining character doesn't notice someone walking up behind them because they're not paying attention. That's not tension that's just stupidity and not worth my time.",1419292800,,1010,4.877906976744186

Of course as you see from the cover art the story eventually leads to the protagonist stuck on a life boat, with a tiger after a huge tragedy strikes him. The limited setting and the limited options for character dialogue, I was on first viewing afraid it would seem boring or slow. The opposite was in fact true! The boy's ""pi"" struggle for survival is harrowing and fascinating.

The end of this story is the best part. To avoid spoilers - you are told two stories about Pi's journey. Only one can be true, one requires faith, the other the more practical yet uglier option. This is left open to the viewers discretion. You must decide which side you stand on. Watching this movie with others can lead to some interesting conversation after the credits start to roll.

4780225,5,B005LAIII0,Good movie,1415577600,,10,4.5
4780226,1,B005LAIII0,"I read the book twice.  The movie takes a lot of liberties....particularly in the storm scene.  I could not watch it as it
was too intense.  This film needs two or perhaps three vewings before it becomes acceptable.",1415577600,,215,4.605263157894737
4780307,5,B005LAIII0,"Life of Pi is a 3D adventure drama film adaptation of Yann Martel's novel of the same title that revolves around an Indian man named Piscine Molitor ""Pi"" Patel. He happens to be a novelist who lives in Canada that tells the story of how he survived a shipwreck at age 16 wherein his family dies and his experience of being stranded in lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific Ocean together with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. This leads him to adventure and a journey to self-discovery.

This movie is critical and commercial success. But I felt that it was a lot better on the technical level rather than the storytelling as the 3D special effects unfortunately somehow supersedes the emotional and insightful story of Pi. Too bad that the magnificent visual splendor of the film could take away the viewers attention to what the main character is all about especially in times of the most difficult moments of his life particularly in his struggle to survive and overcome the most painful ones when his family dies.

But nevertheless,one cannot deny that this remains a great film as it is a visual masterpiece from Ang Lee despite of the reasons mentioned above.",1415577600,2,1169,4.7254901960784315
4780308,5,B005LAIII0,Excellent picture and sound in both 2D and 3D. especially when upscaled to 4K resolutions of all of our TVs.,1415577600,,108,4.45
4780309,5,B005LAIII0,"The visuals in this story are quite stunning.  Even the opening credits are eye candy.  While the story isn't always fast-paced, there is always something to look at in beautiful 3D.  The ending of the story was quite surprising and a decent finish for the two hours I spent watching.",1415318400,,284,4.64
4780310,5,B005LAIII0,"I was trying to find a free version of this on the internet but you had to download them, so I knew I didn't want to get viruses. Knowing that amazon had a wide variety of movies for a pretty good price, I decided to settle on amazon. I rented this movie just for a few hours, and let me tell you, the sound was wonderful unlike the free online versions that I found. There are also words at the bottom of the screen so you understand what they are saying. This is a great movie and I recommend this to anyone who needs to pass time or just wants to have some fun.",1415318400,,564,3.956140350877193

4781688,5,B005LAIII0,"I haven't actually bought the 3D Blu-Ray, but I've seen this film in 3-D about 3-4 times in the theaters.  So this is more about addressing the one other review (at the time of posting) who also reviewed just the movie.

The other reviewer hated the movie and called it misleading.  People think the animals might all be cute and cuddly in this and that the film is for children; it's not.  In fact I would argue it's not suitable for anyone under 9yo in any way.  Mind you there's no profanity, nudity or sex; but it has animals acting in their best interest to survive.  And they are constantly in peril.  It's a movie for older teens and adults.  Despite the animal peril, it's not a depressing film in any way.

Having said that, there's a strong reason it was nominated for Best Picture, and Ang Lee actually won Best Director; it's probably the best movie of the few years.  And in this case, it's all about the telling of the story and not the actual story itself.  I can't tell you any more without giving spoilers, except to say if you are in a philosophical mood, it's definitely a movie you want to see.",1409961600,,1114,4.359223300970874

4781967,5,B005LAIII0,"I loved this movie!  A visual treat for the eyes.  Watch it on a big screen, in high-def, and relax.  Suspend your disbelief.  Again, the visuals are just stunning!  There are passages I could watch over and over and would like to make some desktop backgrounds or screen savers from.  The story is incredible too, and it goes by fast.  Not the best story in the world, but combined with the graphics, it's very enjoyable.  I have watched this twice already, and would not be averse to seeing it again before too long.

I saw this first on DVD from Netflix, so it was only 720 x 480, and still thought it was fantastic.  Get the Blu-Ray or a version that includes a digital copy you can watch on your high-def TV.

4782023,5,B005LAIII0,"And so having read the book through I have rewatched the movie. The book is the work of one man Yann Martel and tells of a sea journey involving a Bengal Tiger and one boy played by a nineteen-year-old that in the movie production took 40,000 people over a year to create. Hard to believe the entire ocean journey was shot in a gigantic water tank. First reaction is, I don't remember reading that in the book. Whether or not the story makes you believe in God the idea of someone surviving the two years ocean currents would take to carry one across the Pacific in essential solitary confinement is nearly impossible to believe. The tiger.... ?

The shots of the zoo in India are gorgeous. Many of the ocean shots are elegiac, the night shots of the stars in particular. Oceanic fluorescence and luminescence at night are a wonder to behold. The Pacific covers over one third of our planets surface and can produce storms with winds of nearly 200 mph and rogue waves capable of eating even the largest ships. Storms at sea make one feel hollow, infinitesimal, powerless. The vastness of this ocean on a calm day as seen from sea level in a lifeboat, mind numbing. All this the movie attempts to reproduce. Should be seen on a large screen but protect your hearing.",1408147200,,1265,4.548245614035087

4783252,5,B005LAIII0,"What Terence Malick tried very hard to accomplish in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tree-Of-Life/dp/B005UKJX4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tree Of Life</a>, with little success (for me anyway- it had wonder at the complexities of life, buku existential angst but little exploration/resolution of the issues raised).  Also strongly reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jesus-Son/dp/B00BESJRSI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jesus' Son</a>, aspects of which I liked very much, but others I found disturbing, without as big a payoff at the end.  But THIS- hallelujah, thank-you Yann Martel and Ang Lee.  I've rarely been so affected by a film.  Surely one of the best films ever made.

***BIG SPOILERS FOLLOW*** DON'T read further until you've seen the film, epecially if, like me you're the kind of person who thrives on discovery and surprise. Reading others' interpretations in advance will color your own, of course.

I am an ardent animal lover too; here animals represent what Pi loves, the things he holds dear.  The film is an allegorical tale, a smorgasbord of metaphoric imagery and symbolism, jam-packed with them, and levels of meaning, designed to meet you where you are, take from it what you need.  I didn't watch this for a long time because I'd read the criticisms from horrified animal lovers.  I thought what happened to the animals was handled with great dignity, care, and was CORE to the tale.  It's no accident that Pi is an animal lover and a vegetarian.  He's also a math whiz, seeks to understand life and the universe on every level possible. What was it young Pi sought from the three religions at the beginning?  He even meets a smiling Buddhist just before the accident who advises him to eat the gravy along with the rice, as ""sailors"", travelers do!

Life, or fate, or God, can be viewed as terrible, unjust, incredibly cruel.  People die, animals eat each other, even more disturbing is what people do to each other (in the second story- the cook, and even Pi himself).  Paradoxically, life is also precious, a gift.  People (beings) in our lives are gifts too, whatever their role in it.  Towards the end, Pi does not cry for the obvious reason.  He wasn't sad because Richard Parker walked away without a backward glance, with no regard for him or seeming gratitude- what brought tears was that HE hadn't thanked RICHARD PARKER!

For me, this is about wonder, awakening, what we've been given, gratitude on the most profound level.  We're human, we can reflect on such things.  The entire universe, not just tigers, is a reflection in your eyes, comes from the depths of yourself, or God's grace, or perhaps they're one and the same.  What is within, what is without?  On a more obvious level, Pi reaped what he sowed (the love you make...), he cared for Richard Parker, risking his life to do so.  Impeccable.  Or was it merely a tale of doing what one MUST to survive, to be, or not to be?  Though outside the scope of this review, I realized later that for me the film seemed suffused with the spirit and imagery of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chuang-Tzu/dp/B002RI99KU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chuang Tzu</a>, so like one of his Taoist fables, imagery and themes-wise (attunement with the natural world, including the forces of nature and beings both human and non, resolution of seeming contradictions, impeccability, boundlessness, etc.).

In purely human, historical terms, it reminded me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Greely-Expedition/dp/B00EDH0RR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Greely Expedition</a>&nbsp;to the North Pole vs the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lewis-Clark-Expedition/dp/B002P3CVNY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lewis & Clark Expedition</a>.  Adolphus Greely, an inexperienced officer, started out bullying his men, threatened them (actually did kill one of them); they were contemptuous of him because at first he hid in his sleeping bag, head covered, shaking, terrified.  Government officials shirked their duty and didn't send food/supplies for them- most of the party died.  The men watched as, one by one, their friends died terrible deaths, from starvation, from frostbite.  But Greely rose to the challenge, gave his own food to his men, eventually evincing empathy, selflessness and courage, and by the end of the horrific ordeal, they adored him, credited him with keeping their spirits up, hope alive (btw, there WAS cannibalism, what brought it to mind).  They made it back and apparently Greely lived a long, enjoyable, productive life, undaunted by the horrors, the scandal, happy to be alive. The painstaking, exhaustive data that he and his men risked their lives to collect weren't even appreciated, gathered dust for nearly a century.  Climatologists are using them today, invaluable.

Then, there was Meriwether Lewis.  The Lewis and Clark expedition, though arduous, uncertain, tough, resulted in the death of only one member (from appendicitis).  They saw wondrous sights, never before seen by colonial Americans (buffalo, grizzly bears, the great plains, giant trees, rain forests, waterfalls miles wide), and enjoyed hospitality and kindness from nearly all the Indians they encountered.  Upon returning home to a hero's welcome- his notes, maps, and specimens celebrated as marvels world-wide- Lewis never got over the hardships they'd endured, e.g., hunger, getting lost, being gone longer than expected, definitely a glass half-empty kind of guy, and faltered at every juncture.  He committed suicide three years after returning (though there was some speculation that it might have been murder, but Thomas Jefferson was convinced it was suicide, and he knew Lewis better than anyone).

Pi, like Greely, shows his mettle by virtue of his behavior, his perspective, what he perceives, and his interpretation of events (his stories).  From a purely psychological point of view, at the very least this is about the resilience of the human spirit, whether or not it springs from a divine source.  Does it matter?  ""Which story do you prefer?""  We needn't wait until WE lose everything to decide.  Much like Billy Crudup's character in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Fish/dp/B007PJFFWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Fish</a>, who finally comes to understand, even share and revel in his father's mythos (but must first shed the self and societally-imposed shackles of supposed ""objective"" reality), Pi's metaphysics and mythos fuse.  GLORIOUS.

Likely more meanings will unfold for me over time (haven't read the book yet, and I need to think more about the significance of the island).  I liked&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Avatar/dp/B003EVWDR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Avatar</a>&nbsp;too, often compared to Life of Pi, but for me it was no match, catharsis-wise.  Life of Pi does, however, remind me very much of another movie I loved that covers some of the same ground (though it's quiet, understated, subtle)-&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dean-Spanley/dp/B0088OP4Q0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dean Spanley</a>.

4783743,5,B005LAIII0,"I originally saw this movie in 2-D and hesitated to buy it in 3-D because I've found that sometimes if it is incredible viewing in 3-D, it sometimes detracts from the message the movie may be trying to convey.  In this case, the 3-D enhanced the message.  I rarely if ever re-watch a movie I have seen, but in this case I have watched it three times and still feel I have not grasped all the meaning the film has to offer.  It is filled with multiple religious views, suffering and salvation, symbols of good (light) and evil (dark), the smallness of man, and it leaves the viewer making his own choice as to what he believes.

The 3-D and artful photography is phenomenal.  Some of the photography takes your breath away, for example the night at sea, totally black, except for the tiny boat and thousands of bioluminescent jelly fish surrounding it. Everything is sharp and clear out to infinity even with the constant water motion which flows up to your TV set.  It's truly like you are really there.  Water spray and rain pour into the room, and I'm sure the experience is much more intimate and engrossing than it could ever be in the theater.

In an era in which CGI has made it possible to put virtually anything one could possibly imagine up on the screen, it has become harder and harder for a filmmaker to make an audience's collective jaw drop. But Ang Lee achieves just that with his adaptation of Yann Martel's ""Life of Pi."" This movie truly has what we, in modern parlance, like to refer to as ""the wow factor,"" simply because it is unlike anything we've seen on screen before. ""Life of Pi"" is a surrealistic tale of survival about an Indian boy trapped on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean with nothing but a ferocious Bengal tiger for a companion.

The first thought we are struck with while watching ""Life of Pi"" is that this movie would have been impossible to make prior to the CGI revolution in filmmaking. With so many movies abusing that technology for sheer commercial ends, it's gratifying to see a film actually using it for thought-provoking and artistic purposes (see also ""Gravity""). At times brutally harsh while at others gloriously lyrical, the movie combines the realistic with the fantastical, the rational with the spiritual - all to illustrate the many disparate and dichotomous elements that, working in glorious chaotic tandem, make up this vast expanse we call the universe.

The first third of the film focuses on Pi's life before the shipwreck. Pi (short for Piscine, which as it shares a rather unfortunate homonym in English, causes Pi at a very early age to abbreviate it) is innately curious about not only the world around him but the world that lies beyond the physical. He is so fascinated with the spiritual, in fact, that he has adopted the tenets of each of the world`s major religions and made them his own. Pi lives with his stern, skeptical father (Adil Hussain), his more open-minded, sympathetic mother (Tabu) and his somewhat less curious older brother (who is played by three different actors in various stages of the story). One of the prime exhibits in the zoo owned by Pi's father is a Bengal tiger that, through a bureaucratic fluke, has been tagged with the name Richard Parker, a prosaic moniker hardly befitting the king of the jungle. When the father decides to sell the zoo, the family, along with the animals, board a Japanese freighter to begin a new life in Canada (the plan is to sell the animals once they get there). On the way, however, tragedy strikes when the ship sinks in a tremendous storm, sending all but Pi and Richard Parker to the bottom of the sea. ""Life of Pi"" is the story of their survival.

Alternately awe-inspiring, heartbreaking and suspenseful, the screenplay by David Magee expands on the  ""circle of life"" metaphor to explore how each element of nature is interlocked with every other element, with each action prompting a reaction unto infinity. Though natural born ""enemies,"" Pi and Richard Parker achieve a kind of symbiosis, ultimately forced to rely on one another for survival (RP for his physical needs, Pi for his spiritual), and in so doing, they achieve a harmony that puts them in sync with the rest of the universe. Yet, for all its pantheistic elements, the movie doesn't over-sentimentalize nature, doesn't shy away from showing us the unthinking brutality that is also a part of that universe, underlined by the fact that living creatures can survive only by feeding on other living creatures. It certainly never downplays the very real danger Pi is in at every moment from his feline companion. This cat may be animated, but he's no cartoon character.

Never one to shy away from a challenge, Lee won a second Best Director Oscar for his work here, and someday the Academy might even see fit to bestow a Best Picture award on him as well (he was certainly robbed of that honor for ""Brokeback Mountain""). As he has done many times before, Lee demonstrates a total command of the medium in ""Life of Pi."" There's a hallucinatory quality to much of the film, as Pi frequently experiences preternatural visions that transcend the confines of the material world and of rational thought, leading him to a oneness with God.

Suraj Shama has been handed the challenge - one might almost call it the burden - of carrying large stretches of this film entirely on his own, with only a CGI effect to interact with. It is a challenge the gifted young actor is more than equipped to handle and he fulfills it beautifully.

Though the movie throws the audience for a loop at the end, making us question the veracity of the tale the adult Pi (Irrfan Kahn) is relating to the writer (Rafe Spall) who hopes to chronicle the experience, no one can ever convince the true believer in all of us that this is anything other than a love story between a boy and a tiger. After all - thanks to the technical wizards who've made it all possible - we've seen it with our own eyes.",1394841600,,4825,4.688311688311688

4784859,3,B005LAIII0,"Well, the effects are nice.  The scenario is interesting for about 30 minutes.  But, seriously, the movie is boring.  Not to mention unrealistic.

Firstly, all those animals were hiding out and not killing each other?  This kid did not hear them?  Had the writer ever seen any of these animals in the wild or in captivity even?

A hyena and a zebra are not going to snuggle in hiding.  That zebra would be kicking and freaking out and overturning that boat.  Second, that kid stood no chance in a boat with a tiger.  Let alone with a hyena!  Those beasts are mean and nasty.  Look them up.

Look, supposedly this story is full of symbolism one should enjoy interpreting.  Ok, there may be educational value in this movie.  But entertainment value?  Not much.

This movie requires effort to enjoy.  Effort to sustain suspension of disbelief.  Effort to interpret its elements.  Effort to stay awake.

Several scenes, as good as they were in 2D, would be visually stunning in 3D.
Still yet, the story is very good and worth the watch.
If you're looking for the ""wow"" effect,  I would definitely recommend seeing this in 3D.

4784997,3,B005LAIII0,"Visually beautiful (even though the CGI is obvious in any shot that involves motion with any speed to it) & very well acted; still it suffers for its deviations from the novel. There are a number of scenes altered from Martel's work or made up entirely & inserted (clearly in several cases for the aesthetic value of the imagery rather than because they added anything to a story that needed no additions), & others that were key to the story as it was put down on paper which were done away with altogether, leaving gaping holes in the narrative & damaging the ending to a major degree. I couldn't see any reason for these changes, except maybe to get the PG rating since some of the deleted portions were pretty grim, or maybe it was felt that viewers would only go for a cleaned up story with a pat ending; but I was disappointed to see what was done, as it diminished the main character & lessened the impact of his journey both across the Pacific & within himself.

4785359,4,B005LAIII0,"I enjoyed this film very much, and would be inclined to give it 5 stars - but it already has many 5-star revews...so I'll object to just a few things.  The opening sequence had beautiful 3D renderings and whetted my apetite for a 3D extravaganza - but the rest of the film wasn't so 3-dimensional as the opening. Fortunately, the core story was quite engrossing, well told, and visually exciting even without much use of the 3rd dimension.  I'll find fault with a metaphorical turn at the end, without mentioning plot details.  There was a brief exegesis in the film, which was in my opinion almost unnecessary, and too brief to make much of the metaphors.  That sent me to the book, which i hadn't read, where I found a much more detailed exegesis, which was interesting, but would have required more preparation in the earlier part of the story in order to make it possible for the themes to make sense.  That might have been a good idea, since there was a little puppy-love story that ended up being a loose end in the film.  That story could have been cut, in favor of stronger development of the vegetarian theme that IMO would add substance to the film. Nitpicking aside, this is one of the most interesting 3D films that I've seen - especially in its opening sequence!",1392249600,3,1275,4.545851528384279

3D makes the scenery and boat scenes interesting to watch.  I'm not a big fan of 3D in general, but it does add to the visual interest of the scenes in this movie.

The film itself is very good.  It's a beautiful story, and thought provoking, with an ending that leaves you wondering (in the same way that the film Inception does) about what is real.  It is also a story of survival and growth.  I am glad to own it.",1391126400,3,575,3.8632478632478633

I waited such a long time to see this, as I missed it in the theaters. I kept hearing how breathtaking the scenes were and heartwarming the story was. So when I got my 3D TV, I bought this right away. When it arrived, even the DVD case said possibly the next Avatar. I couldn't wait to put it in! Well... I watched it last night, and I'm beginning to think the whole world is on drugs! The story was boring. And what beautiful scenery are people referring to, the turbulent waves that are trying to swallow every living thing, the blood thirsty tiger scenes, or the carnivorous island?! Aside from those scenes, there was no movie! I'm even angry today about the letdown. That's why I'm writing this review. Maybe it will be cathartic. lol",1390867200,8,762,4.482014388489208

Even with no animals, just a volleyball named Wilson, it was a more captivating movie than this one. Although I understand this movie is more about metaphysical questions, it just didn't work as an adventure-at-sea movie for me. It was long -- I could multitask, walk away, come back and pick up where I left off. And the ending entirely ruined it for me. When the investigators come to question Pi about the shipwreck, he tells two stories... and to him what matters is which is the better story, not which is the truth. I didn't like the inference that truth doesn't matter. If he weaves a fanciful tale in order for his psyche to survive, that's fine, and if he wants to let the fairy tale be the story, that's fine. But if there's another story about the shipwreck, and it is the true story (as true as something in fiction can be), gruesome though it was, that would be the story I'd prefer to hear, and I don't need a fairy tale to go alongside it.",1390694400,4,1163,5.0

I am not reviewing the story line as I am sure it was as advertised and admittedly did not watch it in flat version because I was very much looking forward to the 3D version.

Plus the carnivorous island could not exist meaning that there is not as much monkey creatures on the planet and the trees look like they have grown right out of some star wars thing.",1388880000,5,724,4.330882352941177

An extended metaphor on the sorrow of life redeemed unto a relativistic, psychologically fragile birth and life of a soul.  High drama, epic in scope yet so microscopically tightly focused and visually stunning, sumptuously colored in deep textured shades that draw the eyes into them.

As an agnostic, religious aspects went right by me.  What I saw was a fabulist allegory.......our species adrift on a small planet in a vast and indifferent universe, our only companions ""nature red in tooth and claw.""  It is worth appreciating that, like all the most intriguing stories, we can see in this film what we want.

The 3D came off beautifully and well worth the money.  Yann Martel, the author, did a great job taking us into his world of evasion and fantasy, weaving in and out of reality.  Ultimately PI survives and shows that perseverance pays.  It's a beautiful film and the sceneries are breathtaking, especially the ""survival at sea"" during the night, the whale, stars, light all of it magical.",1388361600,,520,4.863636363636363

It's one of those stories the whole family can enjoy together, with each individual receiving their own message.  The ""absolute faith"" that God will never leave, nor forsake us, was etched into the heart of a young Hindi boy - indelibly, and forever.  I was left with tears streaming down my cheeks.

4787482,5,B005LAIII0,"Life of Pi may not have been the best film of 2012 (I think Lincoln was a better movie), but it was certainly one of the top couple of movies.  It's a gorgeous film with a great story.  I found the acting by the lead character believable and involving.  The 3D aspects of Life of Pi are subtle and probably make little difference in terms of the the story.  But it certainly has its moments of depth that enhance the beautiful cinematography.  While the film is memorable for the many scenes on the open sea with just Pi and Richard Parker (the tiger), the shots looking upward through the water in the clear-as-a-bell swimming pool are the images I think of most often.  Life of Pi is based on a book that was among my favorites when it came out several years ago, so I was prepared to be disappointed in the film.  I wasn't.  Ang Lee handled the material with great respect, and told the story quite well given the time limitations of a film vs. a book.

I do not get the ratings for this film. I found it boring quite frankly. The whole lifeboat despair thing has been done many times before and done better.
I also can't say I found any true inspiration to any kind of spiritual journey in it either.

Every year The Academy gives out my favorite award for Best Cinematography and its no wonder that Ang Lees Life of Pi won it.  The film is visual eye candy and breathtakingly sweet.  Life of Pi just pours on the visuals.  The 3D is the very best I have seen on any home transfer to date; razor sharp and incredibly crisp.

My favorite scene was when Pi and Richard Parker land on the island of Meerkats.  Seeing Pi basking overhead in one of the island hotspots at nighttime was so beautifully rendered and with the added constellations and star-light the scene was sheer magical perfection.

Astonishing describes it--I'm in agreement with the positive reviews.  But why isn't the regular dvd in this set not in HD?  Why even bother to make the transfer if not using HD?!  Since the blu-ray dvd doesn't play on my computer, I'm stuck playing a blurry second-rate version on it.  Also, it is disappointing to play the blu-ray version on my blu-ray player, and even with lots of adjusting of brightness, backlight, contrast and color, the definition and color is just not there, most especially in dark scenes.

The story itself and the way it touches on so many levels of the human spirit made it a wonderful movie to watch. I know my youngest son will absolutely love it and so it will be one of his Christmas presents.,1387324800,2,332,3.625
4787703,5,B005LAIII0,"I wasn't very interested in this movie when I saw a few previews and heard about it.  My wife really wanted to see it though.  I'm glad I got it for her.  This really made me appreciate my 3D TV and the visuals possible these days.

I don't want to say too much about the movie and spoil it because I think it was even better that I watched it with minimal knowledge of the story and discovered it along the way.

It is a great story about a shipwreck survivor learning to survive on a lifeboat with a Tiger as his only companion.  This isn't a nice fluffy talking Tiger, it is a Tiger that wants to eat Pi (the main character).

I highly recommend this to any 3D TV owner to truly see what your system is capable of.",1387324800,2,717,4.042553191489362

If you are in the mood for a comedy, this is not your movie. If you want yet another story told with  more ammo and camo, keep moving; however,  if you are ready to be reflective and watch the beauty of a boy's journey.  Turn off reality tv and take time to watch  the weaving of a majestic storyteller.

I thought it was all computer animation and that is what the film intended us to think.  Come to find out it also made use of live animals and they were used in cruel ways with the tiger nearly drowning while shooting at least one scene.
Other than that it wasn't even a good fairy tale.  The magical looking waters and such were well done.  As you watch the film, you may get 20 minutes of this magic and nothing else can be described as more than vaguely entertaining.  The end fell flat and nothing ever really developed from start to finish.  90% boring!!!",1386547200,12,655,4.284552845528455

My full review (with spoilers) is here: [...] but in essence, the author wants us to accept that our belief in God is really just a way for us to explain the horrible reality all around us.  We want to believe in a beautiful and purposeful explanation for the cruelty and misery of the world around us, instead of what is actually going on, which is, I imagine, purposelessness, random and survived only by the fittest.

Supposedly President Obama himself endorsed the idea of God presented in the book, and brought to the screen in this amazing movie.  I would have to whole-heartedly disagree with the entire premise, while still enjoying the spectacular visuals.",1386460800,2,780,4.834586466165414

4787874,5,B005LAIII0,"This is one of the best Blu-ray releases ever! Life of Pi was shot with the Arri Alexa Digital Cameras, so the film is breathtakingly life like. The 2D Grainless MPEG-4 AVC transfer is just stunning. The opening scenes at the family's zoo will just blow you away! It really demonstrates the true potential and promise of the Blu-ray format.

The 3D Blu-ray is as near to perfection as I have seen too. There are things that don't catch your eye or attention until you see it in 3D. The 3D effects are very believable. There are just enough in-front-of-the-screen 3D moments to make the experience exciting.

The story is quite engrossing, and it keeps you thinking. This is the type of movie that as a story and spectacle is beautiful to behold. Even on subsequent viewings, the film maintains its charm, and I have enjoyed seeing it in both 2D and 3D.",1386201600,,852,4.562091503267974

What good is being entertained by 'magical' scenes that really worked poor animals like slaves against their will The tiger almost drowned. And why?

4788095,2,B005LAIII0,"I know some people consider pop-outs gimmicky, preferring unobtrusive 3D. They talk about how enhanced depth is all they want. Well, 2D already has depth, otherwise it would be unwatchable. As far as I'm concerned if things aren't popping out of the screen then 3D is absolutely pointless. The pop-out is, after all, the 3rd dimension.

There was virtually no 3D in this film as far as I could tell. Just look at the cover image. How great would it have been to have that giant whale pop out of the screen and into your living room? How about water rushing toward you? Or your living room seemingly engulfed in waves with mist all around? That's what I was expecting when I purchased this film. But none of that was to be found. It's a 2D film packaged as 3D in my opinion. What's the point of wearing clunky and uncomfortable active shutter glasses and putting up with an inferior image if you're not going to get the pop-out payoff?

My 2 star rating wasn't just for the lack of any discernible 3D. Let me put it this way, I probably will never watch this movie again. I just wasn't transported by it. 2 hours spent on the ocean with one character and a tiger were a bit much.",1385424000,,1178,4.3744292237442925

That also implies religious dogma is not even needed. Probably a strong Buddhist influence behind the writers thinking when it's all said and done. The power of GPU computing is on display in this movie. Most of the content is CG. Pretty well done. Computer generated content in movies will only get more pervasive and will improve greatly in the future. Watch the remaster of Lawrence of Arabia.on BLU-Ray as a benchmark. The old way was a great way to do it too. I don't think CG will ever surpass this masterpiece.

Every color is perfect and balanced with other colors. The interior of the lifeboat against the color of the ocean is just magnificent. The acting is wonderful and the dialogue could not be better. So much care, love, and thought went into filming Life of Pi.

I didn't find it particularly thought provoking which was definitely one of the most hyped aspects of the movie. Characters were represented by animals who, in turn, represented various human traits such as courage, greed, etc... This would have been more interesting if it all wasn't so heavy handed.

In the end, a movie is watched for the purpose of entertainment and I was entertained. The story progressed at a nice pace and the underlying emotion was strongly felt which is a fairly rare thing in so many modern superficial blockbusters.

Boy, talk about a story coming to life. If it is possible for you to watch it in 3D I highly recommend that you do. I can only imagine, since I have not seen the regular version, that the range of emotion you get from watching the images become bigger than life has to be superior over the regular DVD. The beauty of it will take your breath away.

It leaves you to ponder, what survival skills do you have, how do you deal with loss and trauma, is rigid religion preferable with death or can you find ways to manage during the crisis.

It's difficult to put into words just what a stunning picture this is. Director Ang Lee has far out-done himself.

But what is a beautiful picture without a compelling story? And the story of Pi (and of Richard Parker) is indeed compelling. This movie is so gripping that you feel like you are part of the story. Starting off with Pi's childhood (and Richard Parker's early years as well) and moving into Pi's teenage years, this film tells a story for the ages. Solid acting combines with the majesty of nature to wrap you up in a narrative that is highly spiritual and suitable for family members of all ages.

It's that rare bird, Martin Scorsese's ""Hugo"" comes to mind, where the effects are there to enhance the story.  ""Life of Pi"" joins that select company.  What director Ang Lee has devised here is nothing short of a miracle.  You will find yourself transfixed by this tale of young Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma) cast adrift in the ocean after the freighter carrying he, his family, and a menagerie of zoo animals capsizes. This film is a testament to will, determination, and faith that keeps Pi alive to survive his ordeal.  Much has been said about Ang Lee's direction and there's no diminishing that but I felt that Sharma to be the driving force of the film.

4789226,5,B005LAIII0,"My wife and I watched this film in HD on a premium channel one evening and were impressed by the stunning beauty of the production in general, so we decided to purchase the Blu-ray edition to fully demonstrate the intense colors and details. We weren't disappointed. In addition, the Blu-ray includes several special features which the DVD does not. The technical eye will perceive some effects which are clearly CGI (the motion of the lifeboat in rough seas is unnatural and the lack of the boat listing when the 300 lb tiger is way to one side of the craft), but these are minor flaws. The story itself concludes cleverly with the viewer to make his/her own decision. In general, a keeper to add to ones collection.",1380844800,2,717,4.653543307086614

4789335,5,B005LAIII0,"Ang Lee's ""Life of Pi"" is strikingly beautiful in many ways, from great cinematography to the story being portrayed.  You need to be prepared is half of the movie is graphics with music.  I will not take the time to compare and contrast this film with others as it is so unique in itself.

I have to admit that I have not read the novel by Yann Martel and I am sure that a lot has been left out.  I will need to read the book to find out what was implied; unless of course the screenplay went off in a different direction.  You will want to watch this film over again after the shock value so that you can pick up the nuances that you missed while you were speculating on what was about to happen.

The basic story is about a young man named Pi (Suraj Sharma) whose father owns a zoo.  Throughout his life Pi wonders about what Douglas Adams calls ""life the universe and everything.""  Because of business concerns his father packs up the zoo animals on a freighter setting out for Canada.  Due to a mishap Pi no longer has to speculate but actually lives ""life the universe and everything.""  We travel with them through his trials and tribulations wondering what we would do in that situation.

One can come away from this film with a new insight or at least say that they saw a movie that was strikingly beautiful in many ways.",1380240000,,1328,4.293172690763052
4789336,1,B005LAIII0,"My mom bought me this movie and I sat threw and watched the whole thing. I was so bored to tears and plus it was too sad. I was crying  the next day and My mom asked me the next day if I had to go live in a stress center and I said ""no"". Sorry Folks! but I'm thinking of giving my copy away or selling it. I don't know. I do love animal flicks though. In my opinion, this movie was like an Asian version of ""Secondhand Lions"" (Which is a movie I did love). If you enjoyed ""Secondhand Lions"", and ""Wild America"" alot better (Like Me), Then stick with those movies. Thanks for reading. Peter Smith",1380067200,6,595,4.0

4789495,5,B005LAIII0,"This magnificent, exquisite film is so superior to most of what Hollywood turns out that any self-aware producer should be acutely embarrassed by it. Nevertheless, I'd like to offer a slightly negative perspective.

""Life of Pi"" is easy to criticize for being a bit sentimental and unduly ""cute"" *. Its worst failing is a glib ambiguity as to what it's ""about"". After promising the Writer that, after hearing the story, he will believe in God, Pi says ""It simply happened. Does it have to have a meaning?"" This suggests the author has no intended meaning for this story, which is reinforced by the suggestion that what we believe is what we would like to believe -- be it about Pi's adventures or the nature of God.

Nevertheless, don't miss it -- especially if you have a 60"" or larger display. The PG rating is apt; there are moments that will frighten some pre-teens.

On a technical level, CGI artists still don't understand F=ma (the lifeboats slide on the water like fried eggs on Teflon), and the orangutan doesn't really look like an orangutan, and moves an awful lot like a human being.

* Richard Parker's name is supposed to be amusing. It was a result of inadvertently assigning the name of the man who caught him to the animal. I suspect the misnaming is supposed to parallel Pi's assertion that he can see the animal's soul in its eyes.",1379635200,3,1350,4.635983263598327

It is visually magnificent with a well written story and narration.  This is a story told by an adult Pi, of his childhood in India and how he survived and persevered at sea with only a full-grown tiger for company.  The movie does have spiritual/religious undertones in it which are left open for personal interpretation.  There are some violent scenes, so I would recommend caution when allowing children to watch.  Not since Avatar has a movie been this visually appealing!

The ending was a bit of a letdown - most of which had a lot to do with, through the accent, I couldn't understand what the actor was saying.  From what I could piece together, the movie wasn't smoothly capturing the alternate viewpoint to the story, as told in the original book.

No problem with the subject matter or the cast, I just didn't like the movie. I'd love to see some of it in 3-D and I'd love to watch the extras (most of the tiger scenes are computer generated) but I won't be buying this one.

4790097,5,B005LAIII0,"I have viewed this film some three times.  Everytime I see it, I get a more and more meaning!  The closest literary meaning is cross a between two stories both of which are different in the length of the narrative:  ""The Lady or The Tiger"" and ""Robinson Crusoe.""  There is so much symbolism to this film/novel, that I think it could take a lifetime of study, to even begin to fully understand this wonderful work, if at all!  LIFE'S MEANING CAN ASSUME A MYRAID AND ASTRONOMICAL AMOUNTS OF DEFINITION!  NJMJr!",1378252800,,508,4.588888888888889
4790098,5,B005LAIII0,"First, I just have to say a technical word. Most of the good reviews of this film rave about the ""3D"" version, and frankly this makes me a little sick. Beautifully photographed, yes, but you don't need to see it in 3D, a passing fancy, to be impressed by the incedible visual impact of this film. It is a Lee masterpiece, and you can hear Louis Armstrong on an old 33/rd pressing of the song ""It's a wonderful world"", and be just as impressed, in fact more so, than hearing it on a modern CD. So let's let the technocrats go here! Those glasses stink.

Second, this is clearly a ""fable"", in its most wonderous sort. The second story Pi tells to the Japanese insurance agents is the True Story, while the movie shows us the Fable. Now, the fable is not a figment of imagination for Pi, it is his only way of saving himself from insanity on an ""Ocean of Loneliness"" and desperation. He believes it to be true. This is the same way that Ennis in the wonderful ""Brokeback Mountain"", also protects himself in his own ocean storm, convincing himself that he visits Jack's room, in Jack's family home with the strange settings and the equally strange parents, and retrieves some of Jack's clothing. The visit is a dream, and it gives poor Ennis just a bit of closure with the loss of his only love. The same with Pi. Having lost everything, his closure is yes, indeed, to ""become the Tiger"". When he is finally beached and rescued, the Tiger leaving him, without a goodbye, is an essential part of his soul departing, and the complete realization of this change and his tragic loss, breaks Pi's heart.

You see, Lee, is a master of the psyche and the heart. He knows how to adapt a novel or screenplay to wring every bit of the ""real"" reality of the story, and how through the most compelling of needs, the imagination of humanity must create its fables to save its ""reality"", to create ""alternate realities"", completely believeable, and to the ""mind"", the truest creation of them all. This goes to the utter sadness of this movie, since all Pi has loved had died,and only Pi, the great Tiger of the mind, the admirer of so many religions in his youth, must live on. As his Father suggests early on ""get reason, first"". Pi, on the otherhand, survives, while ""reason"" finds a horrible and unending death. Fables lead to myths, and then to legends, and these finally are what casts us adrift to ceasely keep navigating our ""boats against the stream"". ""Reason"", as the Bard said so aptly, ""doth make cowards of us all"". I prefer the first version.",1378252800,2,2537,4.51304347826087

what he refers to as ""God"" is quite wonderfully, yet simply, nature; it all its glory, mystery and terrible consequences.  Nature can care for us and it can be dangerous if we don't respect it.  The tiger leaving without a goodbye, nature. the island that nourished and sustained him? nature, mother earth.
but the story was so-so; about a young, fairly foolish boy.  To me it the real story was about the awesome power of Nature.

4790210,4,B005LAIII0,"I never read the book and didn't want to watch the movie, but saw it at a friend's house. Even though I didn't see it on the large screen or in 3D, it was mesmerizing. At first I was comfortably seated on a sofa, but midway through the film I found myself hunched forward, literally on the edge of my seat. By the end of the movie I was crying. That's how gripping the cinematography and special effects were, and to a certain extent the story itself. Although some people dislike the alternate ending, I found it wonderful. There are flaws, but the overall experience overcomes them. For example, in the first third of the tale, there is a fair amount of humor. The humor seems oddly out of place in the story as a whole and is soon dispensed with, never to return. There are some anomalies which are not explored, such as an instance where a goat on one side of a barred doorway is apparently taken through to the other side by a tiger. The tiger is a wonderful character and so realistically done that I thought a live animal was being used for much of the film until I learned otherwise. He has a name, Richard Parker, which seems to be an allusion to an actual person, but I don't want to spoil anything by explaining the reference. All the actors are quite good and manage to make you care for them, so when tragedy strikes, it really hits home. Apart from being trapped on a raft in the Pacific, water is a recurring theme, right down to Pi's real name...his full name is that of a French public swimming pool. The idea of rebirth is linked to that, and Pi's growth from introspective teen to self-sufficient man is a part of it. This is a dazzling and enchanting movie, and well worth watching.",1377907200,2,1702,4.355345911949685

4790358,1,B005LAIII0,"The problem is not so much with the movie making but with the underlying story itself, which is of course unrealistic (being of fantasy genre), but also pointless and boring. I had heard so many claim that the movie is about God. Well, well, well... God must be the ultimate fallback position. When a  story makes no sense at any other level, just say it is about God and there are enough mushy minds in the world that you will find some agreeing with you.",1377648000,6,456,4.364705882352941

Its important to understand the irony when they say the island/Earth during the day gave everything that existed within life but in the night it took everything back. This is exactly what this world is doing to us; it gives us life yet its killing us at the same time as we are staying in it). The truth about who we really are has been hacked from us therefore, we are living a physical animation of a false reality thats far away from the truth.  Fortunately for Pi he knew deep inside something was always missing from his life God and led him to journey outside of himself/his body/the island/earth to get his answers. Ironically, we are living a fictional movie where we believe we are what we see. Unfortunately, this false identity of who we are and the un-knowingly purpose of our life is the main fall in humanity/ Mr Richard Parker lack of understanding of who he is. Unless we wake up to the truth about the beautiful colors that life has to offer, will end up like Richard Parkers faded gray in the end where he is seen walking back into the jungle/earth. The consequence in people not journeying into themselves is never finding God and eventually leading to our destruction. Because Richard Parker/meerkats/people/ never understood their connection and relation to God, karma had a way of letting us know the cycle of re-incarnating here will not rest until we get it right.",1377129600,,1639,4.671280276816609

4790687,5,B005LAIII0,"This is not my normal type of story, but on a whim, I decided to download the movie. I was aware of the book but never really checked out what it was about. Mostly, it's an adventure -- or rather, the ability of a man to tell a great story about an adventure. At the end, you're not really sure if it was a true story, but by that time it doesn't matter because it was such an awesome one. The general gist is that a boy lives in India with his family, who owns a zoo. They are getting their zoo land taken away so they have to move away (to america, I think). They still own all the animals, so they load all the animals onto a ship and set sail. But there is a bad storm and the ship goes down, but not before the boy manages to free some of the animals. The boy is the only one to survive. He drifts along in the middle of the sea in a dingy. He has a monkey and a zebra with him and a very aggressive hyena, who keeps attacking the other animals. The boy, Pi, stays as far away from the hyena as possible, which is hard when you are in a tiny boat. His tiger from the zoo swims up and gets in the boat. Fortunately, he sets that hyena straight, but unfortunately, he is a serious threat to Pi. So Pi spends most of his days floating on a man-made raft outside the boat, while he tries to come to terms with the tiger. Eventually, they learn to ""co-exist"" in the boat.

My summary does not do this story justice. Like I said, this isn't my normal genre of movie, but it held my attention and interest all the way through. I would highly recommend watching -- or even reading -- The Life of Pi. There is a reason it gets such good reviews.",1377043200,,1641,3.9727272727272727

The ending, leaving the viewer to ponder what actually happened was a nice surprise.  You choose, and then...

I've decided to read the book as I've heard it is very rich in detail and will not be a disappointment after seeing the movie.

I highly recommend the movie and will see it again if I have an opportunity.",1376956800,,516,4.505376344086022

4790777,1,B005LAIII0,"Well, folks, I cannot tell you what I thought of this film--I am unable to watch it. Apparently this is a new wrinkle in the production of the modern DVD, specifically Blu-ray versions.  First you have to have updated firmware for your player, then you have to make sure that in fact the source for your DVD is legitimate, and last of all you must give up all chance of getting a true answer from anybody regarding this problem. Ultimately, everyone will pass the buck and the consumer will NOT watch the film. :-(
My Panasonic gives me a copyright violation error message for every source for Life of Pi that I have tried: Netflix (twice) and Amazon. Haven't tried a local rental place because *surprise* there aren't any. They're all closed.  Could try our Library, but they don't really have much in Blu-ray.

It even filled in some of the blanks from the book for me--the image of the Tiger leaping into the life boat--I had trouble imagining how that could happen--but there it was right before my eyes.

The story itself is not all the great either and eventually falls into the twist ending category.
When you learn the true story you end up reflecting back on the entire story and cannot find
anything redeeming about the main character. This leaves this movie as one not worth owning under any circumstances.

A few plot holes exist with the biggest being the owners of the main ship that sinks actually taking the time to listen to his story. They just want to know how the ship sank for insurance purposes..his story lends nothing to that end and they probably would have left in the first 5 minutes.",1376265600,14,830,4.563758389261745

4791013,5,B005LAIII0,"First of all I want to explain the five stars; this is not casual entertainment suitable for a pleasant evening with a relaxing movie, it is intense and provocative drama that will shake you until your teeth rattle. It does an outstanding job of providing a surprisingly serious plunge into drama, excitement, and visual beauty that is not easily forgotten.

We watched this last night for the first time without having read the book or any reviews so this review is strictly on the movie itself. This is a powerful and effective movie which grabs you by the shoulders and gives you a good long shake. It doesn't let go even after the movie is over as one's mind speculates on the alternative stories and considers which one to be really true.

Visually the movie is graphic and powerful and has a variety of strong images mixed with beauty and wonder; if you watch it late at night you may have trouble sleeping. I've found it hard to put the images and thoughts of the movie behind me as scenes from the movie keep returning to my mind.

I recommend you approach this movie with caution as it is a force with which to be reckoned and can imbed itself in your memories.",1376179200,3,1170,4.483568075117371

Great film for any age but if you want to make it a family movie night (we did), watch with your kids if they are younger than 11. There is a scene where the ship sinks and people die and another scene at the end where an alternate storyline is suggested that is pretty brutal.

What offended me the most was the extreme violence depicted in the film. Had I lived back in the days of the Roman Empire, I would NOT have been front row center when they brought the animals out for slaughter. Yet, for the entire second half of the movie, we are asked to sit and watch the surviving animals from a shipwreck kill and eat one another in a tiny lifeboat.

I can only say that LIFE of PI is like no other film that I have ever seen. I expected it to be good but also feared it might have some of those fluffy ""Oh, aren't I deep and brilliant?!"" qualities. My fears proved baseless. LIFE of PI incorporates mystical and philosophical themes very well without detracting from its engaging, hypnotic storyline. It's also touching and poignant without being the least bit sentimental. Despite a few choppy bits, there isn't a seriously dull moment here. Suraj Sharma/Irrfan Khan play the protagonist quite convincingly, but it's the fine cinematography that really makes this film. Absolutely stunning views of the ocean and its life and, of course, Richard Parker the tiger and various other animals.",1375142400,,859,4.850340136054422

At the movie's end, when we came upstairs for bed, he was holding the book, wiggling his eyebrows like he wanted to read it.  Great, mission accomplished!  My daughter--who's 6--was a little too young for this movie though.  She was traumatized by the goat getting eaten, the boat sinking and his family perishing, as well as the whole concept that this poor kid was trying to co-habitate a boat with a wild carnivorous animal.

I think the graphics and the COLORS were brilliant, but the story itself keeps me coming back. I compare this with ""Cast Away""...some may say that it is a slow going movie, but seriously.........if you are shipwrecked by plane or by boat on a desert island or in the middle of the vast ocean in a tiny boat...for several months or years....TIME DRAGS!

The remarkable Taiwanese director adds the crown jewel in an already lifetime-hall-of-fame-worthy arsenal of brilliant films (Crouching Tiger, The Ice Storm, the Wedding Banquet, Eat Drink Man Woman, Sense and Sensibility, Brokeback Mountain...I mean, really....what can Ang Lee NOT do?).  No other living director - and very few ever - comes close to the vision Lee delivers with Life of Pi.  From the indelible images of animals in a zoo that flood our field of vision over the opening credits to its final moments in a questionable raft riding rough pounding seas, the maestro creates a singular unified story for the ages...and all ages too.  Hard to imagine as a novel I never read, the book was not expected to yield such a bounty of sheer beauty and natural punch, but holy cow, it does!  Its a blockbuster And then some.  Even on DVD.

4791769,5,B005LAIII0,"Though I'd give this film 4 and 1/2 stars due to a few very minor quibbles with pacing, I'm happy to give it 5 well-deserved stars on Amazon because it is such a relief to see a big movie of this caliber of quality and craftsmanship in 2013. Yes, there are still some fine movies being made (even some of the ""tent-pole"" blockbusters are satisfying) but 'Life of Pi' is as rewarding and, in its own way, as awe-inspiring as any of the current epic releases helmed by bigger budgets and bigger names. Under genius Ang Lee's impeccable direction the uplifting and absolutely heart-breaking tale of Pi and Richard Parker is brought to spectacular CGI ""life"" with an added and unmistakable dose of dignified Humanity so lacking today, not only in our movies but across our culture. The film is essentially a parable, in my opinion, about the perception of truth and how the human spirit creates magic out of unspeakable tragedy in the attempt to draw meaning and find redemption where there is little of either to be found. Is it the story of a young Indian boy adrift in a lifeboat on the ocean for 227 days with a Bengal tiger as his simultaneous enemy and companion? That, dear moviegoer or movie-watcher, is for YOU to decide. The exhilarating thing about 'Life of Pi' is that you will be amazed by it, and you will find yourself thinking about it. Most truly. Kudos to Ang Lee and everyone involved with the meticulous and admirable execution of this very special film experience. For those who first warmed to the tale via the  book by Yann Martel, rest assured that the spirit of that classic work is painstakingly preserved and adapted with humility and no small amount of splendor. A feast for the eyes, the senses and, especially, for the heart. Adults will hold this film dear, but if you have kids over age 9 (or maybe 12) get them to watch it with you. I have a feeling they will never forget it. It's actually comforting to know that films this lavish and yet so spiritually pure are still being green-lighted by the deservedly beleaguered Big Hollywood Machine.

4791778,5,B005LAIII0,"*** A minor spoiler (or two) here ***

Why 5 star and a title ""not the movie I thought it would be?""  Because I went in with the notion that it was a relationship between a man and a tiger.  But as the story unfolded I was drawn into the movie.  Sure the scene(s) of animals suffering are hard, but this is reality.  What do you expect when a zebra falls 20+ feet - a broken leg!

Putting that aside, I was most surprised about the twist at the end of the movie (and I'm not giving anything away here).  All I can say is for those who didn't like the movie - I think you missed the core plot.  This movie resulted in a lengthy family discussion about the various symbolism and metaphors relating to life.

Imagine being isolated at sea for over 200 days in a similar situation and you might very well come out with a similar story.

I cried once during this movie, the thought of being separated from someone you love (and Robert included) has a profound way of touching your heart.... when it may be the ""END"".  I like how the animals seem so human (emotionally), like the interaction between just the animals on the boat, wasn't just a hunting for food, but a matter of survival in the midst of no-win situation, as people would react in the same situation.  But the interaction between MAN and BEAST can also be beautiful and touching.  The eyes are the window to the soul and I felt I saw this portrayal in both the man and the animal(s).

I have not read the book, and in all honesty I may not now that I've seen the movie and know how it ends.  However, it must be an amazing story to read, judging by how beautiful and detailed the movie is.  It was a much deeper and much more serious story than I expected based on seeing the trailers, and the most fanciful story on a generally religious subject I've ever seen.

4792594,3,B005LAIII0,"I'm about to stereotype myself ALL OVER this review.

I loved the book because I thought it demonstrated the positive aspects of religion and spirituality, without implying that anyone has any idea of what may or may not be happening beyond the observable world.  For me, the defining characteristic of Pi in the book was his unflinching sense of wonder and his unbridled determination to enjoy his life.  He enjoyed spirituality, so he explored it.  He enjoyed biology, so he explored it.  Importantly however, the tone of his narration emphasized the wonder of exploring many world views, rather than the superiority of any one world-view.

<rant>

I thought the movie really gutted that message.  Pi's atheist teacher from the book was completely removed, and his pursuit of Islam was downplayed to the point that many viewers probably didn't even notice it.  There were also many lines that I felt implied that he favored his new-found Christianity over the Hinduism of his childhood.  I only read the book once and watched the movie once, but I don't remember the book having these dramatic moments where Pi shouts ""I surrender"" to god (singular).  The movie wreaked to me of pandering to an American, WASP, Disney-loving audience who wanted to see this young brown savage find salvation in their god.

Yes, I was raised by American, WASP, Disney-loving people, and yes, who I am is very much a reaction to the negative aspects of that culture.  Take my review as you will.  I just think this movie is a disappointingly pale shadow of the book, and that it fails to capture even the spirit.

It also wasn't nearly as pretty as I'd expected from the reviews.  Richard Parker was impressive, as were most of the animals.  On the other hand, endless standing water has to be one of the easiest things to accomplish with CGI.  There were several moments when I suspected that the producers assumed the audience would be awe-struck by an endless expanse, and would need a moment to take in the scene.  Instead, I quickly became bored and began contemplating just how lazy the shot was, and how much better it could have been if they'd played with the perspective and/or field of view.  The movement of the boat in the waves during the storms was also completely unrealistic.  I've seen video games with better in-game physics.

I really thought that this movie was not worth the money or time.

Definitely will not spoil the film's immensity for you -- all that it reveals is a lotta turbulent water with a ship goin' under with almost all hands. The only bearing this teaser might have had on the film was ...... well, I'm not sure.

4792907,5,B005LAIII0,"I never read the book, but this film did not have a choppy feel like you would get in an adaptation. By the way, the cinematography is fresh & vibrant and the CGI is amazing. You are eased into the whole thing with a description of the Pi's early days in India, his experimentation with a mix of religions and the dynamics of his family life. The plot moves along quite comfortably such that you don't feel rushed, neither do you feel bored. Before you know it, you are thoroughly caught up with the all the emotions of a shipwrecked Pi and his fierce Bengal tiger. I kept waiting for the tiger to become a beloved kitty cat, but it made the film interesting that he didn't (steel yourselves to be frightened by menacing growls & lunges). The movie has a twist at the end which I will not reveal. However once you watch the film in it's entirety, ask yourself the following questions: 1. ""Which story do I believe?""  and 2. ""What does my answer reveal about my true nature & my belief about the nature of humanity?"" Your answers will determine which story you choose to be yours.:)",1373068800,,1081,4.405

4793247,1,B005LAIII0,"""Life of Pi"" starts pleasantly, though is confusing.  It has the potential of being something quite thought provoking.  But, the thing quickly degrades into a hellish experience that will leave scarred memories, images that may well remain with the viewer for some time to come.

The mindless, idiotic fool that is the central character fumbles his way onto a life boat while intentionally wandering around on the deck of a ship that is struggling to stay afloat in typhoon conditions.  There are zoo animals confined on this ship, which are depicted as drowning below deck while the ship is slowly doing down.  People and animals suffer miserably, and you get to see it!

While everyone in your living room is begging you to please stop this miserable agony of a ""movie""; you hold on hoping this garbage will improve eventually.  Then you get to see a hyena attack, and mutilate a zebra while the coward is standing in the lifeboat with a ten foot oar in his hands, just looking at the butchery with flies buzzing in & out of his cavernous pie-hole!

I slammed the stop button on the remote, and found myself desperately wishing I could grab that oar and do to the fool what he should have done to the hyena!

If you have children, or adults with sensitive demeanors in your family, be sure to avoid this ravishing torture at all costs!!",1372636800,3,1338,4.635593220338983

Looking back, what was also definable about this film was the intimate relationship these two men share with no overtones of homosexuality. I found this tale a celibration of male in an uplifting and positive light seldom seen in films today. In fact, what I more commonly interpret in todays media is the complete opposite. Religion is also explored in a substantive and respectful light. What a concept. Finally, and the icing on the cake for me, was the dignity and respect paid to love, relationships, our deep connection with the animal kingdom, and in the end this man's Family. I don't hand out 5 stars easily, and rarely take the time to comment about films today, but the quality of this one in particular compelled me to do so. This is an instant classic in my library.

I must say this movie, for me, was nothing short of a masterpiece. There is one scene where PI had to bludgeoned a fish to death and apologizing to the fish in tears for it, and that got me. The are just so many incredible moments that don't want to take away from any person who had not read any reviews  some of the unforgettable and moving moments of the film.

What Pi and the rest of the audience wish to happen, never quite transpires, which offers a good lesson about real life.  The acting, the script, and the filming are exceptional.

4793444,5,B005LAIII0,"It's not often that I say that a movie is better than the book upon which it was based. But Life of Pi takes what I thought was a simple and unemotive book and creates a visually stunning and emotionally evocative movie.

As other reviews are noted, this movie is a visual masterpiece. Ang Lee injects the film with a bold and unique visual style. There's rarely a boring frame in this movie. There's always an interesting composition or lighting effect on the screen. That's no small achievement given that the story primarily takes place on a small boat with a single actor and a CGI tiger. I'm not often wowed by special effects, but some of the shots from underwater really were impressive.

I think Ang Lee and actor Suraj Sharma did a great job at drawing the emotional story out of this book. As I wrote in my review of the novel, the writing style is a bit dry and doesn't really evoke any emotions. However, Suraj Sharma's narration adds real depth to his character. He's not just telling viewers how he caught fish, but also conveying his grim determination to survive. I'm sure it's easier for live actors to convey emotion than it is for words on a page, but I found myself caring far more about the characters in the movie than I ever did in the book.

The movie is very faithful to the book. Perhaps surprisingly so. Ang Lee even kept the part in about Pi's conversion to Christianity and Islam. Again, I thought this was an improvement over the book. I thought the book spent far too much time in the beginning with random musings. The movie presents the same information but much more efficiently and beautifully.

Overall, I'd imagine this movie will please fans of the book, as well as any viewers who appreciate a good yarn. Even if you didn't care for the book, I strongly suggest you give this a try.",1372204800,4,1821,4.492447129909365

By the end, I found the movie to be compelling and enjoyable on a variety of levels.  First, the photography (if that is what it really is these days) is stunning.  Watch this in HD... stunning!  Second, the story line is good... has a lot to it, if you take the time to think about what the movie/story is all about.  One could argue, it's a classic man vs. nature story... or, it's a story about religious preferences... or, it's a life story of ""letting go.""  Or... that's the point - this story line works on a lot of levels.  So, if you enjoy movies that make you think, you'll probably find this entertaining and worthwhile.",1372204800,,759,4.340425531914893

Pi's father lets him witness the cruelty of the way things are --- nature red in tooth and claw. Pi's mother teaches him the gorgeousness of 'it all""  as embedded in the legends or stories of several of the the Hindu gods.  Pi is able to draw on these perspectives when stranded in a lifeboat at sea for many days.  As a student of Buddhism, I find some of the key concepts familiar..eg., to live involves suffering, I do not know enough about Hinduism to really make this comment, but Shiva's dance of  the wheel of  creation and destruction is 'in' this film.  The young actor makes Pi appealing, the adult actor is on target , and also I like it that he is not classically handsome. It is worth seeing a second time.

LIFE OF PI is a wonder to behold, and quite inspirational. Now that I own it, I'm not sure I'll watch it again.  I usually watch the movies I own multiple times.

4793768,2,B005LAIII0,"After finding out what this movie was about, I really did not have much interest in watching it. But then a couple of people whose opinion I respect told me that it was not really about religion and that I should give it a try. I am not sure what they watched, but if this movie is not about religion (or at least about belief in God), then I am superman.

The parable used for communicating the greatness of believing in God is actually entertaining, which is why I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1. The animation used for the tiger and in several other scenes is breathtaking. But ultimately, I could not help but feel disappointed in the constant hammering of the idea of God.

Of course, it is pretty clear that there is a huge number of people out there who will not find any issues with the concept behind the movie, and as such will have a great time watching it. Since I have to acknowledge that if you are a believer, no matter of which religion, this is probably a very enjoyable film. I understand that. However, for those out there that are similar to me, do not believe in deities and have no interest in watching a film that argues for believing, then this is probably not a good option.",1371772800,,1202,4.290748898678414

The animation is great as well as the imagination it took to put some of the scenes together.

4793802,5,B005LAIII0,"On one level, this is an action-adventure film about a boy and a tiger stranded on a boat.  But if it's approached that way, the beginning and ending of the film seem hard to reconcile.  This film presents a question that gets to the heart of religious faith in a way that both the believer and the non-believer can appreciate.  It's about all religions, not just one.  Pi is serially attracted to several of the world's major faiths, but the unique dogma of each is not the appeal.  It's the idea of religion that is the subject of the film.  Soon after the scene is set, Pi endures a terrifying ordeal involving a tiger and a lifeboat.  When it's over, he tells his story to skeptical investigators.  What has really happened here?  By posing the question the way it does the film offers an answer that tries to unravel the nature of faith and the purpose of belief.  I can think of far less interesting ways of spending two hours than watching this beautiful, challenging and thought-provoking film.

The story of the making of the movie (in the blu-ray edition) is as fascinating as the movie itself.  Yes, it's (mostly) a digital tiger, but the technology simply does not reveal itself.  At all.  Side-by-side footage of the real tiger and the digital one are indistinguishable.  This is one case in which the work put into the making of the film is justified by the depth and beauty of the story.",1371686400,2,1402,4.552

It is a good movie and would be amazing if is a true story but I don't think it is but it is an amazing story and it was well worth the price to be a collecter's edition for just $20 bucks!

4794643,2,B005LAIII0,"The film Life of Pi follows the book very closely with the characters, the adventures, and the author's imagination. Most CGI looked extremely life-like, and the picture technicalities displayed the beauty of our earth as well as the beauty of man's creativity.
The disturbing part, however, remains the story and the theme. Self-proclaimed to ""help you believe in God,"" Life of Pi shows you what modern adaptations to religion do: reduce it to a feel-good, insubstantial putty. You may get warm fuzzies from the intention of the film, yet you will be left with no concrete idea as to why you are feeling said fuzzies upon further analysis.
For me, the story frames religion as an extra force pushing to destroy you, which paradoxically keeps you alive through its trials--in essence, unnecessary work that serves to maintain your sanity and survival. Religion as voracious tiger, island, or--in the book--carnivorous blind man? Some people perhaps subscribe to religion as a necessary evil, though I find that answer untrue and unenlightened.
The movie turns into a dark, dragging depression with anecdotes to flash a smile on the viewer's face to keep him/her watching. Overall, the movie extended longer than the book and convinced me that I'd rather drown than consume Yann Martel's religious theory.",1370908800,3,1304,5.15566037735849

Whether it proves the existence of God is up to the viewer. I believe in Him, so I could see it. Well told and beautifully filmed. Good acting, and refreshing to see some new faces on the screen.

4794752,5,B005LAIII0,"A well made movie worth watching in the theater, where I saw it, or at home on your screen via Amazon Instant Video.  With all the dime-a-dozen crap movies Hollywood is cranking out these days, this was refreshing to see.  It had depth and originality, providing the audience with stories of life-changing and soul-making significance.  Would someone who likes ""only action"" movies with lots of guns and cars like it? Probably not. But read the summary and watch the trailer, and if it piques your interest, I'd definitely recommend that you watch it.

And if you're into the deeper mysteries of life, death, family, suffering, survival and liberation, the concepts of illusion,truth, perception and wisdom, you'd like this. Add to it the beautiful cinematography and you may be lost in its beauty as I was, mulling over the meanings of this and that with my friend for hours afterwards. I would buy it for $15  but not for $25. (The 25$ standard for me is industry-changing, movement-causing, classic-in-the-making movies - Shawshank Redemption, Matrix, Star Wars)

If you do order it, try to drop the hype you've heard from your mind, including this review - you may not like it after all. I've noticed that when people say a movie is great so much, and then I see it, I am usually disappointed.  Release your expectations for a better movie experience.

The behavior of the tiger, Richard Parker, was not believable, specifically when he inextricably stayed under the canvas for so long.  Also, his inability to claw his way onto the canvas after Pi did not seem realistic.  Why did not Pi succumb to sunburn after days of exposure?  How Pi and Richard Parker survived with so little water was not adequately explained.
We thought that far too much time was spent on the lifeboat scenes for no purpose.  On the other hand, the last 10 minutes or so of the movie really tied the loose ends together and got our attention.",1370822400,,737,4.587786259541985

4794960,5,B005LAIII0,"If only it were possible to rate LIFE OF PI as a 10-stars video, based on the following:
* Plot--This story is as magical as the fairy tales that fascinated us as children
* Characters-- Despite their foreignness (to us) as Indians, they have universal appeal as a family of four embarking on a life-changing journey.  The father is strict, knowing that he must teach his sons life's lessons in order to survive.  The mother's compassionate, yet practical.  The older son is more like the father; not so vulnerable to life's travails.  Younger son, Pi, is soulful and his classmates' bullying has helped strengthen his character and his ability to overcome adversity by using his clever intelligence.
* Dialogue--Conversations are believable and flow alongside the narration.  While the characters have Indian accents, it is easy to understand what they are saying.
* Acting--It is amazing how well the main protagonist, Pi, portrays his role.  It is his first professional acting and his performance is exceptionally good.  Each actor has fulfilled his/her role admirably.
* Direction--Ang Lee is known for exploring complex themes.  His adaptation of the novel was outstanding.  He won the Best Director Oscar at the 85th Academy Awards, pitted against the renowned Steven Spielberg.
* Sequencing--There are no disjointed cuts in this movie.  With so many locales and scenes, it is almost expected to be choppy in places.  The movie segues seamlessly from one moment to the next.
* Sets--Filming is done in India, Canada, on a ship, at sea, a tiny island, and in a hospital room.  The vast majority of it is at sea on a small lifeboat and flimsy raft.  The smallest details are included in each one, adding depth to their locales.
* Visual Effects--Done with CGI, it is impossible to discern if the animals are real or digitally portrayed.  Staring into the tiger's eyes is frightening and at times, breathtaking, as Richard Parker's (the tiger's) face assumes almost human emotions.
* Color--Simply spectacular!  We watched this on a Samsung TV, giving us an enormous spectrum of color in many shades. Compared to watching other movies and regular programming, the hues of this film were superior to anything else we have seen, except at movie theaters.
* Technology--Filmed in HD and 3D, viewers get as realistic a feeling of actually `being there' as possible.  Clarity overall was excellent and made the nighttime sea life and storm scenes `pop'.  The same is true for the island locale.  While we do not have 3D, we think those very scenes and locales must do a magnificent job of enhancing the experience.

If you usually watch a movie more than once, then you can count on enjoying LIFE OF PI many times.",1370736000,4,2713,4.936123348017621
4794961,2,B005LAIII0,"This film has convinced me that movie critics are in collusion with film makers to keep the industry profitable. Life of Pi is highly overrated.

A writer interviews the syncretistic main character who has a fascinating life story to tell. However, beyond that, there seems to be no point to this film. Life of Pi teases the viewer with the promise of a profound spiritual insight, but that never happens.

Oddly, the talented actor Grard Depardieu cast as a surly chef on the doomed freighter and appears for less than 30 seconds in the film. Looks like Depardieus best work ended up on the proverbial cutting room floor.

Cinematographically, this is a beautiful film. I cant argue with that.
Unfortunately the digital animations of the zoo animals were not quite realistic enough for me.

My recommendation is: don't waste your money. If you do, mute the TV until the last 5 minutes, which is the only part worth watching.",1370736000,,925,4.79874213836478

4795058,4,B005LAIII0,"Life of Pi is a story of Pi Patel, the son of a zookeeper, who is the sole human survivor of a  violent shipwreck. We see his struggle for survival aboard a 26 foot boat with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker who is initially a threat to Pi's life, but ultimately saves his life.

This movie certainly did the book justice for me. A visual feast for the eyes, the film lives up to the imagery described in the novel. I did not see the movie when it came out in the theatres, but I can imagine how even more beautiful it must have been. It was as if someone took the color on my TV screen and turned it up to number 12.

One such beautiful scene is when suddenly at night, Pi is surrounded by glowing jellyfish which light up the night; meanwhile, a whale rises and soars out from underneath the water. It is one of the most visually impressive scenes I have ever seen and Ang Lee's visual effects team is deserving of the Oscar.

Many scenes I was looking forward to being in the movie were actually in the film. One is the scene where Pi writes his name on the board at the start of each class to best make his name memorable to his classmates and teachers. Also true to the novel, we also see the alternate ending Pi gives to the detectives.

In terms of differences, while the movie is very close to the storyline novel, the book is much more in depth. The scenes with Pi's religious contemplation is much more involved as well as his survival on the boat. On the contrary, the scene when the boat is caught up in the storm and about to sink is actually more intense than that scene in the book itself.

Another difference to note is that the movie is not as graphic as some scenes in the book. With scenes of some of the animals attacking and killing each other on the boat, as well as the ""interesting"" food choices Pi is forced to make trying to survive, I expected a little more gore...although I cannot say I am disappointed to be spared seeing such moments, especially since I watched it with my four year old son! I suppose in order to appeal to children and maintain a PG-13 rating, these graphic elements could not be included.

My verdict is to see watch this movie! I would have enjoyed Lee's Life of Pi even more had I experienced the visual effects on the big screen. This is definitely an enjoyable film, even to those who adore the book.",1370649600,3,2357,4.259507829977629

4795213,2,B005LAIII0,"I was excited to see this movie, since the idea of being trapped on a life boat with a Bengal tiger is quite interesting to say the least. But the religious connotations were confusing and annoying (they seemed extremely ""philosophically dated"" to me personally since I had dealt with those questions long ago and left them in the dust), and in my opinion too away from the movie. Without giving the movie away, all I can say is that the ending was very disappointing! If the acting, dialogue and plot other than the main tiger scenes were developed even slightly, then I may have at least enjoyed the movie as a whole. Positives: the ""fantasy-impressionist-style"" cinematography at see was spectacular, and some of the tiger scenes almost made me hold my breath, but not enough to save the entire message of the movie, which is important for me. I'm 54, have seen hundreds of movies from classics to foreign to documentary, have been an avid reader since the age of 9, was an honors student through school, and majored in English. There is no way in my mind that this movie should have gotten the attention that it did.",1370649600,2,1120,4.633165829145729

4795295,4,B005LAIII0,"The concept of this film is bizaare.
Hardly inspired but certainly iconoclastic just for the sake of being so.
And then submitting two possible interpretations at the very end - what does that add?
It begins with an odd premise in the first place - a vegetarian family in India that runs a private zoo full of carnivorous animals who moves it to Canada on a ship - well it's a new first at least.

It's implausible from the beginning but succeeds thereafter as an involving fantasy with appealing visuals.
The tacked on alternative ending serves little purpose but I guess does serve to bring it all down to reality in a certain way.
An oddity is this film's obsession with vegetarianism vs. meat eating.
From the Buddhist ship travellers assuring the Indian family that the gravy is ok for a vegetarian (even though it might have meat in it???) , to the father showing the son the violence of the tiger as it attacks a helpless young goat, to the implied gorging of the tiger on the orangutan, zebra and hyena, to the vegetarian family with carnivores to an island of more meerkats per sq. foot than ever seen before providing more flesh for the tiger.......see what I mean?
The whole thing is nonsensical.  Or maybe it just requires more suspension of belief than the usual movie fantasy.
Also I understand why he is called Pi, but what does that have to do with anything else in the story?
Including his ability to memorize and calculate incredible numbers of digits for the value of pi?

Even though there never was a moment when I thought ""Gee why didn't I think of that"" I give it 4 stars anyway for the wtf factor alone.",1370476800,,1627,4.5272108843537415

Nope, I thought the book was great; I read it first. Now I've seen the film, and like it as well. Maybe if you like Dancing with the Stars stirred up with World Wrestlemania you wouldn't like this. I dunno. There's no sex scenes. There's no arrows and spears plunging from the screen into the front row seats. Just a darn good story, well done. And yes, philosophy too.

4795440,3,B005LAIII0,"LIFE OF PI is quite simply a visual feast of spectacle.  From the Indian locations of Pondicherry in the past, to the sequences taking place at sea, a quite wonderful evocation of an uninhabited island where the plants are predatory, to the final sequence taking place in sunlit suburbia in Canada, the film is full of memorable images.  The moments involving the animals - especially Richard Parker the tiger - are equally memorable; if they have been created using CGI, they certainly did not seem so.  Director Ang Lee has a wonderful way of suggesting the animal's predatory nature, yet at the same time its straightforwardness (unlike the human characters).  At the same time, I have to admit that the plot of LIFE OF PI is slight, to say the least: one can understand the central character's desire to discover himself and his relationship to God, but the progress of moving towards self-awareness is sometimes a slow one.  The film drags on occasions; one wishes that more character-conflict had been introduced, especially involving Grard Depardieu, who has a memorable cameo as an obstreperous ship's cook.",1370390400,,1115,5.005405405405406

4795818,5,B005LAIII0,"If Frank Darabont's The Shawshank Redemption, James Cameron's Titanic, and Alfred Hitchcock's Lifeboat made you believe in the power of story, then so shall Ang Lee's Life of Pi by way of Yann Martel's book of the same title. Like Shawshank Redemption, the protagonist undergoes physical, mental, and emotional damage that will either kill him or make him stronger although transformed. Like Titanic, a ship goes down and carries away family, safety, and security upon its descent. Like Lifeboat, an unusual mix of characters share tight, claustrophobic, treacherous quarters in a bid to survive at sea. Life of Pi is a beautiful story well-matched with breathtaking cinematography, visual effects, and sound design. Based upon the strength of these separate elements operating together in excellence, Ang Lee won Best Director.

Truly fantastic is the powerful allegorical revelation of God in science based upon two interpretations of horrific, life-changing tragedies in the world of the protagonist a teenage boy. A storm at sea throws Pi either into the hands of God, or Mother Nature, or as Pi would have it--both. Driven to his physical, mental, and emotional limits while adrift for 227 days in the Pacific Ocean, Pi addresses the strains on his capacities by adapting to his horrific reality via spiritual, religious, scientific means, or perhaps cognitive dissonance.

Some may view Pi's interpretations of his reality as opposite and therefore impossible. Others may view Pi's interpretations as complementary, and entirely reasonable. One step further and the viewer may even choose to accept the concept of God as the creator of all science and all scientific laws, God as the creator of evolution. Two steps further and the viewer may understand that logic and reason remain entirely compatible with religion and spiritualism. After two viewings, the only surprise that remains with Life of Pi is that it did not win the award for adapted screenplay.",1370131200,,1964,5.271565495207668

4796611,5,B005LAIII0,"Before I started watching this movie, I was thinking how in the world could anyone make a movie with a boy and a tiger in the middle of the ocean worth watching. I couldn't even think of one thing that would make it remotely interesting, but this movie surprised me. The beginning won me over with its witty moments. For instance, Pi discovered Islam and then practiced it. Then, I imagine it wasn't a day later he was asking to be baptized in the traditional Christian manner. Pi's mother could only smile. His father thought it was foolish. The story continues and eventually, he discovers Richard, the Bengal tiger, and he is taught a lesson about what the animal really is. I don't think he learned anything from that lesson, and I don't think he ever does. The story kept moving and eventually went to the ship sinking and how Pi came to survive with the tiger.

I will admit I was surprised and at awe at this movie. It was thoughtfully written and beautifully presented. I was most interested in the floating carnivorous island, and all the meerkats. That part was so cool, and I was just smiling while watching that part of it. Everyone involved in the creation of this movie did a great job. The hard work and creativity involved did not escape me, and I am glad I took the time to watch it. It was truly refreshing, new, and breathtaking.

4796718,5,B005LAIII0,"Pi is a precocious Indian boy from Pondicherry, India.  His family owns a zoo.  In that zoo is a Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker.  Pi is also a spiritual child, rebelling against his rationalist ""New India"" father.  In his spiritual journey, Pi melds Christianity, Islam and Hinduism in his effort to find and love God.  A cynic might interpret this as a touchy-feely globalist literary prop to make the movie more likeable to a broad global audience whose members are actually locked in post-enlightenment zeitgeist of religious war and tension.  That same cynic might also add that the true god of Corporate Globalism is a one-out-of-three unholy trinity of Migrants, Mammon, & Moloch.

The political situation shifts in India and Pi and his family sell the zoo and transport the animals on a Japanese freighter for Canada.  On the ship they meet a rude French cook, a kind-hearted Japanese sailor and look after their animals.  One night there is a terrible storm and the freighter sinks, Pi is the only human survivor.  On the lifeboat, which is half covered by canvas, is an injured zebra, an female orangutan who has lost her baby to the sea, and a vicious hyena.  As the shipwrecked zoo progress on their journey, the hyena kills the zebra, than the orangutan, and then suddenly , Richard Parker, the Bengal Tiger leaps from under the canvas, killing the hyena.  Pi is then alone, with a vicious tiger.  Pi must tame the great cat and use his wits to help them both survive.

In an epic of surreal filmography Pi and Richard Parker drift across the Pacific, during one storm Pi sees Almighty Providence, when he tries to show the sight to Richard Parker, the tiger is seized with fear and must duck under the canvas.  In a delirium, Pi and Richard Parker wash up on a strange island-a garden of plenty by day but death by night.  Eventually, Pi washes up on a beach in tropical Mexico, and the tiger returns to the to jungle without looking back. Pi is then rescued by natives.

At this point, the viewer is left with an unsettled feeling.  Pi's more important journey with God is soul-less, globalist nonsense, his reconciliation is nowhere near as believable as Lieutenant Dan's Jacob-like wrestling with God while tied to the mast of a shrimp boat during Hurricane Camille.

However cynicism drops away and the entire meaning of the movie changes in retrospect with a subtle plot twist. Pi speaks to some Japanese officials in a Mexican hospital.  They are investigating the shipwreck as part of an insurance claim.  They don't believe his story.  He tells a different story-one of a dying, kind-hearted sailor, a resourceful and Darwinian French cook, and his scared mother in a lifeboat.  This story is darker, more emotionally taxing, and involves murder and cannibalism.  Without letting on which story is true, Pi mentions that the tiger Richard Parker was much like his Id, his will to survive, his inner-evil.  During the storm, when Pi sees The Almighty, Richard Parker can only tremble in terror.  This, second story takes the movie to a higher level.  It is a story that sticks in the mind, causing one to think backwards about the nuanced, subtle details in the story.  A viewer then picks at the suddenly real, suddenly rich, and suddenly colorful spiritual symbolism.

4796814,3,B005LAIII0,"I finally got around to watching Life of Pi. I was less than impressed.

Sure, it was full of great visuals. Amazing visuals, even, but those don't make the story. [It's the same reason I could never follow a crappy story in a comic book just because it had good art (Spawn).] The story in Pi was very much lacking. The only reason it gets such a ""wow, that was so deep"" response is that it's one of those stories (the movie for sure and probably the book (though I haven't read the book)) that people can't figure out. Rather than say ""I don't understand,"" they instead say, ""that's so deep."" Especially the critics, who can never just admit that something doesn't make any sense. Vague symbolism is always a sure way to baffle the critics into saying something is great. [One of my college professors was the same way. The sure way to getting an ""A"" from him on a paper was to write something beyond his understanding or deliberately vague enough that it seemed beyond his understanding. Rather than say ""I don't know what you're saying here"" or ""This doesn't make any sense,"" he'd just put an ""A"" on it.]

However, the biggest problem with that aspect of the movie is that there is a message in there, revealed twice during the movie but obfuscated rather than just stated plainly: believing a lie is better than believing nothing. Or, as it's put forth at the end, ""It's better to believe a beautiful lie rather than an ugly truth."" That's a sorry message to be delivering and one I just can't get behind. No matter how pretty the package it's wrapped in, and Pi is a pretty package with beautiful bows and ribbons. It's not enough to disguise the ugly truth of the movie, though. Well, maybe, actually, it is. For most people.

The other big issue I have with the movie is that I hate (I mean I absolutely can not stand) getting to the end of a story just to find out that it didn't happen. [I mentioned this same thing in my review of Looper.] Don't waste my time with a story about a story that didn't happen. Don't have it turn out to be a dream. Don't have it turn out to be a time loop that gets closed off so that none of it happened. Don't have it turn out to be a hallucination to cover up something that the character can't handle. You've wasted my time at that point.

And, in Life of Pi, it reduces the only interesting part of the movie to the 30-40 minutes that happen before the storm. Then it's over. And that was hardly a story and one in which nothing really happened other than that someone survived a horrible stranding at sea.

And, sure, you can get all wrapped up in discussions about whether the tiger was God or what the heck was that island supposed to be, anyway, or whether he just made up the story he told the insurance people about the cook just so that they would have something they could grasp, but none of it matters. It doesn't matter because of the statement, ""Which is the better story, and wouldn't you rather believe that thing than believe the truth?""

So, yeah, sure, Pi was pretty. It deserved the awards it got for those aspects of the movie, but it certainly wasn't a ""best directed"" movie. It was a hardly directed movie. I'm glad I watched it; I even kind of wish I'd seen it on the big screen just for some of the scenes on the ocean; but I don't think it was a great movie. It might look all deep when looking down on it, but, if you put your feet in, you'll find it's just a wading pool.",1369612800,2,3441,4.310664605873261

Now I'll admit the cinematography and the 3 D effects on a movie theater screen probably were spectacular, not so much on my home tv. Since it is most times difficult to understand dialogue with Indian, English and Australian accents; we always use the close captioning feature. Since this is not a feature you get in the theater we could actually understand the dialogue.

In a time where movies seem to be trending behind a ""dark & dreary"" i.e. (let's redo snow white, with a dark edge to it!, let's redo Batman, again, and make him EVEN DARKER) this movie was a welcome departure from that recent trend. This story very much took a dark subject matter and paints it in a warm vibrant light, although the story itself is very dramatic, the way the story is chosen to be told, works wonders.

I don't choose to watch those shows where the poor antelope is ripped to shreds by its predator.  I had no idea that that's what I'd be subjected to in this movie.  And to what end?  What uplifting, or even edifying, conclusion can we reach?  Oh yes - animals are animals.  Survival of the fittest.  A tiger may be trained, but he'll never love you or be your pet.  This is not entertainment, in my book.  The 2 stars are for the excellent acting and animation.  Everything else was just upsetting and depressing.",1369526400,,683,4.471544715447155

4797201,4,B005LAIII0,"Ang Lee's latest film Life of Pi is a visually stunning and breathtaking experience. It is one of the few films that, in my opinion, is actually better suited for 3D than boring ol' 2D, and is perfect to experience in the movie theater rather than Netflixing in a couple months.

Pi is so impressive because it is consistently entertaining and surprising for two or so hours, surprising for a plot that doesn't have much action. It does follow a pretty standard Hero's Journey format, with some pretty sad (but not tear-jerking) moments. By the end, it becomes clear that almost every scene is necessary (save the love story that goes nowhere). Plus, it borrows from Big Fish in that much of what REALLY happened is left open to interpretation, and I like to see that in big-budget movies. It is far too infrequent that we get films that generate engaging discussion among audiences, and I am happy that Life of Pi gives us that opportunity.

The film's strongest suit, as you've no doubt heard, is its visual effects. The best effects, in my opinion, are always those which blur the line between what is real (physical) and what is not (CGI), and Life of Pi provides consistently jaw-dropping and convincing images that are hard to forget. The camera work is exceptional as well, with non-traditional shots and transitions. Some of the most memorable are bird's-eye shots, overlooking the protagonist Pi and the tiger Richard Parker floating in the sea, at a perfect 90-degree angle.

As much of a visual and intellectual treat as Life of Pi is, it is hard for me to imagine Academy members and audiences regarding it as the best film (not just one of the best films) of 2012. I absolutely liked it, hands down - but in a year with emotional powerhouses like Silver Linings Playbook, Brave, and many other movies that left a stronger impression on me, it is really a far cry from Best Picture 2012.",1369440000,,1899,4.679640718562874

4797523,5,B005LAIII0,"The movie version of Life of Pi is directed by Ang Lee and includes quite a lot of computer graphics. It looks good in 3D and is well acted. Suraj Sharma and Irrfan Khan deserve a special mention as the young and adult Pi. Gerard Depardieu plays a small but significant role. Adil Hussain and Tabu are excellent as Pi's parents. The screenplay is fairly true to the book, but there is a romance element that has obviously been added, Hollywood style, and is completely unnecessary. There is a scene in the ship's dining room which, while not in the book, obviously serves as a device to give background for the alternative story by introducing the sailor who breaks his leg, and the cook. I was sorry the scene with the priest, the imam and the pandit was omitted. While the CGI and 3D effects were brilliant, I felt the storm/sinking ship scenes asked the viewer to suspend disbelief a little too much: how did Pi manage to get back to the lifeboat from so far away in the high seas?

4798036,4,B005LAIII0,Not my favorite movie - but interesting to say the least. Hate that at the time it was only available by purchase instead of rental. I spent a lot of money to watch a movie once. Good idea if you plan to watch something numerous times though.

Pi's fear will be your fear - absolutely no lie.  But Richard Parker steals the film.  Watching Richard Parker play his role is nothing short of miraculous!  He was ROBBED of his Academy Award, and I have seen the film more than six times and I still can't find his credit.

This film will bite you as you have never been bitten before.  It is a very rare and unusual story that is magically brought to life.  Get your treats, go to the bathroom, and shut off the phone before you start this film.

I was very impressed with the novel. So impressed, that when I found out a movie was being made, I was very excited to view it. However, it seemed that the focus was on main points not necessarily the same sort of focus the book portrayed. I may be more critical just because this is the way I interpreted the book, and to see the movie from such a different interpretation may have been where the disappointment stemmed from, but nevertheless I still finished the movie with an opinion that ""nice, but if never watch that again.""

It's a great story and having lost my Mother at a relatively young age, I could relate to the main character in many ways.

However, it is a good movie and am not sorry to have purchased, just don't even remember now - 2 months later - any particular 3D moments.

I could not understand part of the dialogue, due to the Indian accents of some of the actors.  At times, I thought the plot dragged on abominably (but I was sick at the time and not very patient).  The ending was confusing and didn't seem to resolve anything.

I borrowed the movie from my local library at the cost of one dollar. It wasn't worth it. The whole time I was watching it I was thinking, ""What the hell is the point of this movie?? Is it going to get better any time soon??"" I had to fight to stay awake. It was two hours of my life that went irretrievably down the drain.

I am absolutely at a loss to understand how any sane person could rate this movie anything higher than one star. What a profoundly ridiculous premise:  the kid is in a life boat adrift on the ocean along with a tiger, a zebra, an orangutan, and a hyena who take turns getting ""lost"" under a tarp that covers the front half of the lifeboat. They somehow magically appear at various times to provide material for each scene. One can almost hear the director out of sight saying, ""Okay, cue the tiger!"" The hyena and tiger pose an obvious threat to Pi's existence, but he easily could have just charged them when they were near the edge of the boat and...viola!...into the drink they go. No more threat. Oh wait, I forgot. That would make sense in his struggle for survival, but this is really an utterly pointless movie.",1368835200,10,1377,4.181132075471698

If you can handle the shot where The Tiger eats a meercat on Meercat Island, you will love this movie.  I did -- I've ordered my own copy of the movie, and can't wait to watch it again.

This is an incredible film that I would recommend to anyone of any age.  There is a lot to love.  The special effects are so lifelike that you forget that there is NO WAY they could have had the tiger and the boy on the same set.

4798603,4,B005LAIII0,"Ang Lee has a fine record for making unusual films, and from `Eat Drink Man Woman' through `Hulk' to `Brokeback Mountain' has proven to be the antithesis of a formulaic director. True to form, his film of Yann Martel's ""un-filmable"" book `Life of Pi' is a triumph of cinematography and storytelling. The underlying themes of God-evidenced-in-Nature and the victory of the human spirit in adversity are very well realised by Lee's narrative structure and editing, and the film is a feast for the eyes and the mind.

The story is told in first-person narrative with Pi as narrator, his character played by four different actors as he ages. The excellent young Suraj Sharma takes the lion's share (tiger's share?) as the 16-year old Pi in the film's main sequence when adrift on the Pacific with Bengal tiger Richard Parker following a shipwreck. Sharma (picked from 3,000 actors who auditioned for the part) delivers a convincing performance of fear, struggle, cool intelligence & courage, and gradually masters his hostile environment and terrible predicament, growing spiritually on the journey as he asserts dominance over the tiger so that they might both survive. Although for safety reasons the tiger and Sharma were filmed separately, you will absolutely believe in the terrifying visceral power of their face-to-face confrontations and in their developing relationship.

The wildlife in the film looks superb and the wild animals behave exactly like wild animals, red in tooth and claw. There's no sentimentality here, and the viewer is never spared the cruelties of nature. For this reason the film may be disturbing to young children despite its often enchanting visual content.

The Blu-ray 3D release contains a documentary film (itself in 3D) about the making of the film in which Lee explains how he conceived the film from the beginning as a 3D experience for the audience, and that this is the medium in which it needs to be seen. There's a lot of detail here for film buffs.

Some have chosen to nit-pick at details of the film and a few have disliked it; it may be that for those viewers this is just not the kind of story that floats their boat, so to speak. `Life of Pi' strives to explore deeper territory than the average Hollywood fare, in a highly original way. Lee succeeds in discussing the philosophy of religion; is there a creator and where can we experience evidence of it in nature? This is quite a difficult trick to pull off in a 127-minute film whilst entertaining the audience at the same time, but Lee's rare talent does just about manage it - and with a sting in the tail, too: at the end of the day, which story do you prefer?",1368576000,,2662,4.818380743982495

Of course, the tiger deserved that even more, and all three avatars of Pi were incredible. The oldest Pi, the university teacher of religion in Canada, had a face nobody could distrust or dislike.

Needless to say, the cinematography was beyond incredible. I can only imagine how stunning it must be in 3-D; I watched it on a flat screen Panasonic 42-inch plasma and my jaw dropped dozen of times.

And that's it. Enough, shall I say, to join the thousand-plus reviewers who have awarded five stars? Only for the technical accomplishments, however. I found the ""preaching"" silly and annoying, just as i feared I would from having read the children's book upon which the film is based. To author Yann Martel and to director Ang Lee, I only this to say: Listen to Pi's Father! ""Use your Reason!""",1368576000,3,914,4.70625

4798897,5,B005LAIII0,"Are there enough adjectives to describe such a film? If viewers are able to let go and just let the movie be itself, there are so many images and ideas floating through it that one could spend a lifetime sorting them out. The storyline seems so realistic, the close-ups of animals, the sea, the sky, facial expressions, the eyes of the . . . well, the tiger--all are part of a fantasy that someone has put before us to see. The more one reads about how the movie was made, the more there is to admire. This film is a treasure that will always hold secrets to be discovered.

The film is rated PG; if younger children have read books containing different types of fantasy and understand that films can also be ""made up""--although they look very real--they should be comfortable seeing the film. The peril of the ship/storm and the subsequent events are the most intense, but it helps to remind children those are ""imaginary.""",1368576000,,924,4.566265060240964

It is a little slow getting started and because it is a story told by a individual who speaks English with a British/Indian accent thru narration it is sometimes difficult to understand for an American like myself.

So I bought it - in the meantime her daughter downloaded it so they watched it - however the DVD was on its way.  SOooooo,  I decided to watch it -  I was mesmerized. In fact I had to go Google the story behind this to understand the symbolism of the animal characters....... Then invited a friend to watch together - she was delighted/intrigued as well.  (for two somewhat talkative women - both very silent as we watched - now that's a true recomendation).  This is the type of movie that ""stays with you"" - wondering if I should also read the book even though I'm sure the movie did it credit.

4799146,5,B005LAIII0,"""Life of Pi"" transcends the concept of a story with a theme. It clearly demonstrates the existence of God. It's also wonderful storytelling. I believe this accounts for why it is so popular.

For a movie to appeal to my senses it must be about something that is not only interesting but that I would never expect to see happen in my everyday life. ""Life of Pi"" meets both of those criteria. To see wild animals on a lifeboat, and then to see a young man co-exist with a ferocious tiger on that lifeboat, and then to see both survive for many months while adrift in the middle of the ocean, simply defied my imagination.

The plot, although fantastic, is very well developed and proceeds logically, which adds to the credibility of the story. Reality is represented by mathematics and a traditional religious belief, which eventually gives way to a belief in a universal concept of the divine. In other words, it may not be enough to believe in only one religion anymore. By his becoming a follower of three religions, Pi's life is transformed. He demonstrates his universality throughout the story.

The basic plot of the story is one that many people might have thought of or written about. However, Yann Martel told this story in such a way as to make it more believable than if the plot were simply concocted from his imagination. All entities are equal when pitted against the forces of nature. It required a profound belief in God by Pi to enable him and his tiger companion to overcome enormous odds against their survival. The author brought this out in the story very well.",1368403200,,1581,4.639285714285714

4799149,5,B005LAIII0,"This movie reminded me of many areas in my life where it seemed all hope was gone.  I am not sure if this was based on a true story but I feel it may have been.  For those who lif\ke to look into the deeper meaning of life, and believe there is a God.. this is the movie for you!  It takes faith and challenges of life to a whole new level.  It makes you feel like your right on the boat with the main character of the movie (Pi).  This movie never got boring, it just went from excitement  to excitement from start to finish.  As a avid animal lover, and lover of challenges and adventures of life myself, this was the perfect movie for me.  I highly recommend it !  It is well worth the rental price, and you will be thinking about the deeper message of faith and never giving up, after it is long over.  I give it 5 out of 5!!",1368403200,,829,3.9397590361445785

This movie is moved by underlying currents of deep meaning that effectively pulled me in slowly but surely .... into a thought provoking heartfelt experience that left me glowing with new appreciation for life & all i share the journey with.
One reason i was able to be pulled so deeply into this was the acting....top notch, & the visuals are stunning... also....the actors are all fresh faces to me....so it bumped up the believability factor as there were no memories of past performances attached to the faces to pop up & interrupt the experience.
Seriously, the actor who plays the young Pi deserves an Academy award for this one.... or at least a standing ovation....HE made it believable....not the special effects.
Congratulations is in order for all involved in this masterpiece of a movie.
I put off seeing this because i figured since i had read the book...i would be encumbered by the ""been there done that"" syndrome....but strangely enough that was not the case at all even though it seemed to follow the books story line pretty closely.
I won't go into details, im sure there are plenty of reviews that are giving plot specifics...so i will wrap up the review by saying that this is one of the few movies that I KNOW i will be watching again soon...as there is just too much to take in, in just one viewing.",1368316800,3,1448,4.66015625

There are many subtle nuances in the story, which makes me want to see it again.  The storm scenes are terrifyingly graphic, and evoke the awesome power of nature.  On the other extreme, there are scenes of magical beauty and serenity.  I love the treatment of the three major religions being embraced by the young protagonist.  This was, of course, treated in more depth in the book, and was one of the things I particularly liked about the book.

4799684,4,B005LAIII0,"This movie is great to watch with family, because apparently, it's about a boy who is stuck with a tiger in a boat after a shipwreck. In the end, one understands what really happened to the boy, and it's horrible to think about. But this last part went way over my kids' head, so it was OK to watch with them. A very clever story, magistrally executed by the movie director.",1368230400,,374,4.28169014084507

4799686,5,B005LAIII0,"A visually stunning and fantastic story.  The animations were fantastic.  Nearly impossible to distinguish the fake tiger from a real one.  My only criticism is that so many of Pi's adventures described in the book are not included the movie.  How about a ""Life of PI"" sequel?",1368230400,,276,4.808510638297872

I loved, loved, loved the novel, and amazingly, did not realize that other readers believed in the ""other"" version of Pi's story! What does that say about me, I wonder... At any rate, the film was wonderful, and the actor who played the young Pi was absolutely excellent. The adult Pi was very good as well. I had no intention of watching the film, as I usually don't when I have read the book, but ended up doing so, and I am so glad I did. I wish we had more ""other world"" films like this in mainstream American movies.
Five stars absolutely, for an outstanding film!",1368230400,4,704,4.1838235294117645

4799761,5,B005LAIII0,The pricing and delivery were great.  But the movie is just fabulous.  You will be talking about this one for days after for the hidden meanings.  It was like the movie 'Inception' in making you talk and discuss.  Spoiler alert:  There are two possible story lines and you choose the one you want to believe.  I chose to believe the story like the Japanese insurance investigators.  The cinematography is just unbelievable....absolutely  deserved the Oscar.  Another stellar directing job by Ang Lee.,1368144000,5,500,5.074074074074074

This epic of a picture had everything in it for anyone to love and even shed a tear.  It is filled with lots of adventure and hidden meanings to life in general.  I watched it in 3D and was mesmerized by the photography/graphic work done on this film.  The acting was also fantastic.  It is a MUST SEE Film!

4799906,5,B005LAIII0,Loved this movie. Absolutely amazing story that captures your attention and keeps you emotionally attached to the characters (yes there was more than one) all the way through the movie. The film is a bit abstract at times so don't expect to take everything literally. I have a few friends who didn't like this film but I personally loved it and would have voted it best picture over Argo.,1368144000,2,388,4.63768115942029
4799907,5,B005LAIII0,This is a great movie and the story is fantastic. Leaves you guessing in the end. A story of survival that is scary and funny too. Not recommended for small children since there are scenes of hurt and dying animals.,1368144000,,215,4.4

4799912,2,B005LAIII0,"I'd heard good things about Pi and wanted to like it. However I found its philosophy to be puerile at best. I am not religious, however my understanding is that each religion believes in One True God... therefore the cherry-picking approach espoused by adult Pi would really offend believers of all faiths.

The awkward flashback structure (wherein adult Pi explains his childhood obsession with religion to his house guest) fails to drive the story forward. It just meanders until the ship sinking.

Finally the plot gets Pi in the boat with the animals, which leads to some gorgeous but empty CGI sequences at sea. There is nothing here in the ""man vs. nature"" portion that Melville, Hemingway, Heyerdahl or even the Noah legend already said better. Frankly, I turned Pi off after the god storm sequence and read a book. This crunchy New Age magical mystery tour was putting me to sleep.",1368144000,,889,4.842105263157895

4800037,4,B005LAIII0,"The Life of Pi is an adventure story with a touch of mysticism. However, I would NOT advise watching it in the company of small kids, simply because it may be a bit unnerving for them to watch carnivores do their normal - and perfectly natural - things.

4800042,2,B005LAIII0,"This is an interesting story that a lot of people thought was adapted well to film. I don't agree. The tiger is all visual effects and although they were impressive, they were not ready for prime time and the tiger looked fake and did not have very tiger-like behavior.

4800119,4,B005LAIII0,"This movie's cinematics were eye-catching, although it used a familiar formula as seen in The Usual Suspects. Moral of the story could have been more relevant. Embellishing the truth with untruths is still lying.",1368144000,,212,5.264705882352941

4800122,5,B005LAIII0,"I hate to admit it but I have never read ` Life of Pi"", I have come close many times to reading it but have never quite got around to finish it. In my opinion the book is quite unfilmable because there are many elements that exist in the book cannot be truly captured for the big screen, but after watching the film adaptation, I have to admit that Ang Lee has done a very good job.
There is a shipwreck and Pi finds himself on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.
Spiritual questions about faith, meaning of life are the backbone of this film which has been created with the help of CGi. However the CGI is beautiful and drop dead gorgeous. The movie on the whole is very beautiful to watch- possibly the best looking movie in many years- the whale in the night, the scenes in Pondicherry, the Island crawling with meerkats, the squadrons of flying fish, the ocean and the supremely regal Richard Parker. This is a film that celebrates the lush beauty of visual cinema through state of the art CGI: Drop dead gorgeous. Claudio Miranda the cinematographer deserves an applause.",1368144000,2,1093,4.49748743718593

We watched Tangled 3D and it had a lot more depth (constant throughout the film), while this had depth but not during every scene.

4800527,3,B005LAIII0,"Just watched Life of Pi, well made movie I must say... I was looking forward to ""hearing a story which made me believe in God"" sorry but doesnt it do the the exact opposite? Great advice from the father ""I rather have you believe in something we disagree on than have you accepting everything blindly, and it all starts with thinking rationally""... Which version do I prefer? The one with the animals in it of course, now which do I believe or which is the ""truth""? It is a question of whether you are a person to face a hard truth or do you route evidence for convenience and choose to believe a nice lie... It gives proof of how the idea of God is an invention of the human mind... Does it matter if the outcome of both stories was the same? Well, does the truth matter to you? I know it does to me... Do you search for answers or do you just have faith, period. If Pi was the tiger, then he ate part of the zabra (sailor) and he ate the hiena (cook)... He canivalized himself and invented a story to both forgive and cope with himself for the rest of his life... So he says ""he brought out the evil in me, I have to live with that, I was alone in a boat and I survived"" and ""hunger can change everything you ever thought you knew about yourself""... Storytelling is fantastic though, well done!",1367884800,,1296,4.188

4800529,2,B005LAIII0,"Life of Pi asks big questions but leaves audiences with few answers. This latest Ang Lee movie is an adaptation of the eponymous novel by Yann Martel, which already had a large readership before Lee announced the upcoming film release. Life of Pi tells the story of Piscine Molitor Patel who grows up in India, where his father owns a zoo. He changes his name to ""Pi"" to avoid jokes about his name's homophonic similarities to the slang word for urination. The story could be divided into three acts: 1) his years growing up in India, 2) the shipwreck and his life as a castaway, 3) his reflections on his experiences.

The film begins with Pi speaking with a freelance writer. Pi's uncle told this writer that Pi had quite a story to tell and so the writer came to investigate. The film is Pi's narrative.

Though growing up a Hindu, Pi explores Christianity and Islam and finds admirable things in all there. In one scene he is engaged in praying to Allah on a prayer mat; the next shows him crossing himself before he eats. This sequence of shots, with the adult Pi narrating his exploration of religion, confronts the audience immediately with an ""all paths lead to God"" form of spirituality that is reflective of the contemporary milieu and the philosophy of John Hick. At this point, Lee has given the film profound religious dimensions.

Pi's father decides to move the family and bring the zoo animals along to sell in North America. On their way, a storm hits the cargo ship and Pi ends up being the sole survivor after being lowered in a lifeboat. The lifeboat also holds a hyena, an orangutan, a wounded Zebra, and a Bengal tiger named ""Richard Parker."" The hyena ends up eating the zebra alive, followed by killing the orangutan, only to be eaten by Richard Parker. Pi ends up fishing to feed the tiger so that he won't decide to eat Pi. They end up coming to an island, which they then leave after discovering that its ecosystem was carnivorous. The lifeboat ends up being washed ashore on the Mexican coast.

After they reach land, Richard Parker journeys into the jungle and leaves no trace behind. Representatives of the cargo ship owners visit Pi in the hospital to learn why the ship sank, but instead get Pi's extraordinary story of survival. They refuse to believe it, so Pi tells a metaphorical story whereby the Zebra is a wounded sailor, the orangutan is his mother, the hyena is the ship's callous cook, and Richard Parker is Pi himself.

Pi asks the writer which version of the saga he prefers. The animal version, he replies. Pi gives him the report filed by the ship company representatives, which reads that Pi held the record for shipwreck survivor longest at sea, and simply notes that he was accompanied by a Bengal tiger. We are left to interpret that comment ourselves. Does this last note demonstrate that there was evidence of a Bengal tiger on the ship and hence lends credence to Pi's story? Or does it merely indicate that the company representatives preferred the fantastical version?

Somehow the audience is expected to come full circle--the beginning of the film asks questions about God's existence and the human spiritual experience and the movie ends with Pi uttering cryptic lines that are supposed to have answered these questions. I left the theater rather unsatisfied, not because there were no answers, but because Lee failed to even provide the connection between the three parts of the film. We moved from big questions in the first part to an end that jumped to a vague interpretation of the castaway experience.

The clear import of the closing scene is that we can choose to view reality as mundane and material, or we can see it in all its manifold beauty that whispers the existence of God as corroborated by mindboggling providence. There is something inherent in us that wants to believe the latter and, lucky for us, the latter is true. If anything, Life of Pi is an argument for the existence of God based on the experience of beauty--whether it is physical beauty (the trailer shows jaw-dropping scenes of splendor that do not disappoint) or the beauty of storytelling.

Life of Pi oddly lacks a theodicy. It doesn't address the pain of why Pi's parents had to die and why there's a Darwinian food chain in the lifeboat. The story might be trying to go one-step more and relegate these painful episodes to being part of the conflict--a necessary component to any good story. And that's what we're wrapped up in: the story of the universal soul. This is intellectually rooted in Hindu-Buddhistic views of cyclical history that can celebrate such a story of suffering without demanding justice from a higher power.

To sum it up, the appetizer in the beginning and the dessert at the end tasted good, but the main course seemed completely unrelated to either. The whole time spent eating the main course was similar to an idyllic and eye-popping version of Tom Hanks's Castaway that singularly focused on survival. I have not read the book, so I'm not sure if Martel does a better job with this, but Lee's adaptation left something to be desired.

Cons: Pretentious, lack of depth, narrow-minded.  It doesn't promote imagination, it kills imagination.  By the film's logic, we ought to believe in fairy tales because they have a ""better story"" than real life.  Pi's story doesn't make you believe in God in any way, instead it attempts to force you to prefer ""God's story"". People may choose to believe it but in all seriousness nobody really believes the story with the tiger because it's simply made up.  It's not another perspective or anything because the two stories CANNOT be true at the same time.  It equates religions to stories that help us cope with reality; major diss to religion of all kinds.",1367712000,,720,4.958333333333333

I found myself wishing the tiger would eat the young man.  The only relief I felt when the boat landed on the Mexican coast was that the movie was finally over.",1367452800,5,292,4.490566037735849
4801149,2,B005LAIII0,"I'll probably get bashed for leaving this review by those who have read the book and who have a better understanding of the hidden meaning(s) in this movie. But I don't think a person's understanding of a film should be contingent on reading and completely grasping the novel prior.

The special effects were dazzling in and of themselves but they were distracting to the overall story line. Jellyfish don't fluoresce to the point of creating a ""glow stick"" effect making everything visible in the middle of the night in the middle of the ocean. Meerkats don't live on some ""bionic island"" in the Pacific nor do they sleep in trees. They burrow in the ground and live in Africa. So many times the water was way too calm and it was obvious they were filming (several) segments in a pool and it was obviously synthetic.

From other people's reviews it seems that the second story that involved real people was what really happened. But what felt so deflated was how so much attention and detail were devoted to the fantasy of story #1 that when the second story was told in a mere forty seconds - I felt so ripped off. Maybe a brief visual or some flashbacks capturing the violent/turbulent time with the human survivors might have made it more salvageable. It came off as poorly executed and something quickly tossed into the movie.

For me this movie didn't make me ponder or embrace a higher power. This is what we're supposed to think simply because he survived a ship wreck? God spared him? What about the people in the supposed second story (what really happened) who didn't survive like his mother and the cook and sailor? If the story were told from their point of view we'd have a very depressing movie pondering that there is no god at all. Instead we are fed a sugar-coated, extravagant lie and now we're supposed to feel all warm and fuzzy inside. So much detail paid to fantasy and the animation and not nearly enough to details and to conveying a consistent and infallible message. Oh and that last scene with the Tiger slowly walking into the jungle as if to say, ""See ya, wouldn't wanna be ya."" left me totally flat. I expected too much, I guess.",1367452800,,2160,4.576227390180879

I could play it on the computer, tv/dvd combo and even my small radio/cd/tv/dvd portable boombox type, though. I returned it, and received a new one that did the same thing. I did not want to go through the hassle to return it, so I had to connect my boombox to my tv in lieu of my actual dvd player to get this to play on my tv. This is terrible.

4801550,3,B005LAIII0,"I stand with my decision from the subject line. I'm not really sure how this won so many awards. The movie was really long and really boring. It took forever to get to the part where the main character was stranded on a boat, and then once he was there, the movie just dragged and dragged. It definitely could have been shorter because there's really not much you can work with with a kid stuck on a boat for a long time. I ended up falling asleep during the movie because it was so boring to me.

I do not believe the film even attempts to ""prove"" the existence of God, at least not in any scientific or empirical sense of the word ""proof"".  Instead, the film presents an excellent humanist justification for faith, one that deftly avoids the scientific debate by focusing on preferences rather than proof (e.g. ""Which story do you prefer?"").",1367366400,3,512,4.873563218390805

With the movie, as soon as I realized Pi's family died at sea, I lost interest - I didn't believe it at first and kept waiting for them to return.  Anyway, all the actors playing Pi were good, but for me, Pi as part of his entire wonderful family was the draw in the story, and as soon as I understood his family was lost, I became brokenhearted and emotionally left the film.  I was happy Pi survived, but Pi's mother and father were so interesting, had such different parenting strategies and outlooks on life, yet managed to give their son so much knowledge and wealth in love and care, that he survived nearly a year shipwrecked - their loss was too huge for me.",1367366400,2,724,4.2700729927007295

Often a movie is disappointing when compared to the book but I think they did an excellent job of capturing the essence of the book. There were a few minor changes, which my wife quibbled about but all in all a wonderful job of capturing a magical story. The 3D was nicely done.
 The story itself is about an Indian boy who has a great interest in religion (Hindu, Christian, and Muslim) whose family owns a zoo in India.

We started to watch it with our 7 year old son not knowing if it would be too adult for him.  The tiger growled and lashed out at the boy too much for him as he was scared-due to incredible visuals.  So my husband and I watched it later after our son went to bed.  I may not reccomend it to kids under 9.  Our son loves Star Wars and isn't afraid of Darth Vader.

4802018,5,B005LAIII0,"Like a good mystery story? With an entertaining ending?
Add a great adventure, and a very realistic portrayal of a boy and a Bengal tiger surviving on a lifeboat, and you have a great movie. Wrapped up inside this movie, with more than enough action to keep our attention, is the question of a search for the meaning of God, in a way that even the most devout (of any religion) can accept and learn from.
I'm not giving out any spoilers, which would be so easy in discussing the conflicts in the film, but it's clear that this coming-of-age story has enough going on to keep both teens and adults entertained, and that's on the small screen.
We missed it in theaters, but even on our small 32"" in SD we were completely caught up in the story. If you've got a large HD TV, you're in even better luck, since the astonishing life-like special effects and the glorious scenery will keep you glued to the set.
Pre-teens may cringe at the accurate portrayal of wild animal behavior, but it's little more than any one could see on a National Geographic special, and is entirely in keeping with reality. I mean, there are no talking animals, and they are not ""humanized"" in any fashion. A tiger is a tiger is a tiger, in other words.

4802100,5,B005LAIII0,It is easy to see why the movie was awarded so many Academy Awards. We had our doubts as we usually don't watch animal movies. We did not know what it was about. It was a wonderful story. Grabbed our attention immediately.,1367107200,3,222,4.309523809523809

4802106,5,B005LAIII0,"The author, not yet 40 (amazingly) when he wrote the book, has been quoted as saying:

""Suddenly, my mind was exploding with ideas. I could hardly keep up with them. In jubilant minutes whole portions of the novel emerged fully formed: the lifeboat, the animals, the intermingling of the religious and the zoological, the parallel stories.  Where did that moment of inspiration come from? Why did I think that religion and zoology would make a good mix? ...I could give approximate answers. That India, where there are so many animals and religions, lent itself to such a story. That tensions simmering just below my level of consciousness were probably feverishly pushing me to come up with a story. But in truth I don't know. It just happened.""

""It just happened...."" the rendering of raw life into something far more profound, something universal, a tale known by heart by an unfortunate number of souls who have experienced a ""shipwreck""; and, a morality tale, one that can transcend the obvious carnal horror and touch upon that which is beyond our experience, that in which our experience has its being, and its purpose.

What is a shipwreck? One is journeying toward something, with hope, and the vicissitudes of life foul the journey.  When the ""ship"" goes down, everything is lost.  One is left in a hostile world surrounded by the unknown and the horizon disappears twice a day, dawn and dusk, into itself.  There are no markers, there are no maps.

A tragedy for which there are no words, a loss so deep that it rivals the power of nature, an ocean of loss.  I know this by heart. I, too, now live with a very large and very dangerous animal.  This is a fight for survival, it is no game, it is no fairy tale.  I feed the beast as best I can and try to avoid it.  Ultimately, I must learn about it and it must - in some way - co-exist with me.  Together, uncomfortable companions, we seek safe harbor.  Safe harbor is far from safe, it is self-consuming.  The only safety is in not looking for it; the only path is back into the journey, the beast and I, toward life.  Can we find it, can we survive? I will not be consumed by the beast, but neither can I consume it.  We are together now, whatever the future.

Shall I tell my story in its brutal reality, tearing into the consciousness and sensitivities of those who hear it?  I learn that this is not a prudent choice.  And so I tell it in this way, as I have said, the beast and I.  Everyone fears the beast, do they not?  Yet, not everyone travels with one, and so the story can be safely told.

There is magic and even beauty in even the worst horror.  Nothing is without purpose; this is part of the lesson.

You cannot tame the beast.  There must be a partnership, a reluctant partnership.  You may find comfort in the oddest of places and when least expected but, ultimately, you must continue the journey.  Or die trying.

""Even when God seemed to have abandoned me, He was watching.  Even when He seemed indifferent to my suffering, He was watching.  And when I was beyond all hope of saving, He gave me rest, and gave me a sign to continue my journey.""

Evil and horror are real, but they are encapsulated, they are quarantined from the essential element of soul.  The beast can enter our lives; we can succumb to the horror and be eaten alive, by our own lack of hope and loss of faith.  Or we can arrive at a place where we, and our beast, co-exist.  I am not yet at the place where my beast leaves me.  Perhaps I never will be.  There is something in us that wants to hold onto the beast.  And we are left with two stories: the horror or the hope.

""Can I ask you something?""
""Of course.""
""I've told you two stories  about what happened out on the ocean.  Neither explains what caused the sinking of the ship and no one can prove which story is true and which is not.  In both stories, the ship sinks, my family dies, and I survive.""
""True.""
""So which story do you prefer?""
""The one with the tiger, that's the better story.""
""Thank you.  And so it goes with God.""

I own probably every major 3D Blu-ray release, and this was a huge disappointment.  It was like ""3D"" was just slapped on the cover as an afterthought, and no effort went in to the transfer of the source material to Blu-ray 3D.

It's a tough movie to watch if you're an animal lover -- I was speechless and in tears for a very long time after it ended.

4803155,5,B005LAIII0,"After the spectacular choices on the menu of 2012-13 Oscar movies, Life of Pi got pushed down the list of movies for me to see. I ended up waiting until its release, and I rented it from Amazon Instant.

After experiencing this in HD, it instantly became one of my favorites of the movie year. I would put this only behind Lincoln. This movies shows that a director can take the new high tech 3D tools of modern movie-making and craft an incredbile story. A story that does not rely on these new tools to make it an incredible movie, but one that tells a story that is only made more vivid and breathtaking by the use of said tools.

Not only do you leave this movie in awe of the visuals, but you leave it with a sense of mystery that lies at the heart of the movie. One that a viewer needs to experience to understand. There is an incredible mystery threaded through the movie, and one that comes to an interesting culmination in the end. This movie left me completely in agreement with the choice of Ang Lee as Best Director.

Please watch this movie before making an appraisal of this past year in movies.",1366675200,4,1109,4.322115384615385

The Oscar people suck, again. A great story. Great cinematography. CGI and puppetry that looks so real(don't waste time and attention looking for it now that I mentioned it or you could end up a pretentious schmuck who votes on future Oscar winners.

Unfortunately, for me, it fell short on both sides.  I would rate it entertaining, but not worthy of a second viewing and short of my expectations.

I want everyone to experience it.  Maybe some won't.  Maybe some will.  And, hopefully, if you do, it'll happen during the movie, not twelve hours later.

4803570,4,B005LAIII0,"It's been a long time since I read the book, but if memory serves me correctly it seems that this movie does a good job at staying true to the story.  The animation was good and realistic, so while you knew the animals weren't all real you didn't care because they were close enough.  The story told what it had to, did it well, and moved along at a pretty good pace.  All in all it was quite entertaining.

If you're a Christian realize that you'll probably have to discuss with your kids the inherent difficulties of co-opting all religions into one, as the main character does.  His father tells him that believing in everything is much like believing in nothing, which is all too true but an issue that the main character never addresses.  But in the end the final message about faith in general is a good one.",1366588800,,814,4.3933333333333335

4803576,4,B005LAIII0,The story is much more complicated than the special effects.  I may have to read the book now that I have the gist of the story.,1366588800,2,128,3.923076923076923
4803667,5,B005LAIII0,Very entertaining. Found it interesting how the Gospel of Jesus dying for the sins of man was made so plain in this secular film. It was a film of courage and faith.,1366502400,2,165,4.1875
4803668,1,B005LAIII0,would never watch this movie again and would not recommend to anyone I like. this movie bored me. Too far fetched maybe a child would like but I don't think this can keep their attention for very long,1366502400,,200,4.2894736842105265

4803673,5,B005LAIII0,I really enjoyed the story behind the scene.  The effects were awesomely done.  Seeing how the tiger & Pi became friends was an experience on it's own.  Anyone of any age should enjoy this movie.,1366502400,,195,4.514285714285714
4803674,5,B005LAIII0,"The humor, editing, every bit of the movie was a gem.  The sheer mastery of how human and animal emotions intertwine stuck a real chord in me as an animal lover.  This is a movie for the ages.",1366502400,,192,4.026315789473684
4803675,4,B005LAIII0,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, but it certainly wasn't the philosophical bent that was presented.  I loved the views on religion and at the end Pi's ""which story do you prefer?"" just said everything that needed to be said.",1366502400,,237,4.511627906976744
4803676,5,B005LAIII0,This movie kept me engaged throughout the whole thing and I cannot think of another movie I have seen recently that did that.  One of the best flicks I've seen in a long time.  I paid $5 for the rental and will still be buying it.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie! So did my 3 year old who doesn't like anything except cartoons lol some of the content went over her head and was a little too mature for her but she loved it. 5 STARS!,1366502400,2,427,3.941860465116279

4803779,5,B005LAIII0,This was a long-awaited film for me after reading the book a number of years ago and then listening to the audible book on my daily commute I now have amazing visual interpretation.,1366502400,,181,4.515151515151516
4803780,5,B005LAIII0,"Mesmerizing images abound throughout this movie and will keep your attention whether or not you find the story hard to swallow. The 3D effects are not overdone.

The scene in the lifeboat with the broken zebra, the grieving orangutan and the hyena was more than I could bear (no pun intended).  While Pi was screaming no, I went fetal, covered my ears and screamed NOOOOOOOOOO.  Then I ejected the disc.  I couldn't sleep and had nightmares. I'm 54 years old.

4803785,4,B005LAIII0,I enjoyed the book and enjoyed comparing the book to the movie. I agree it was well done considering how difficult the imagery was. I am not sure how much I would have enjoyed the slow parts with no book history.,1366502400,,212,4.195121951219512
4803786,4,B005LAIII0,"Director Ang Lee is getting better and better in telling stories.  The blu-ray version of the movie will bring out the best of a great television set.  The movie was so well made, two plus hours went by very quickly.",1366502400,,216,4.375
4803837,5,B005LAIII0,"This movie was fantastic for our whole family! Even though the younger members didn't understand everything in the plot,the amazing graphics and animal scenes kept them happy! Those of us that did understand everything were impressed and moved emotionally..... Great acting and scripting! LOVED it!!!",1366416000,2,300,5.688888888888889
4803838,2,B005LAIII0,There is a scene with a Hyena killing a Zebra in a lifeboat and then fighting in the same boat with an Orangutan. How can a movie with such a graphic scene be rated PG?  This movie should be rated at least PG-13.  If you have little kids please watch the movie yourself first and decide if it is appropriate for your little ones. The Rating board did an awful job in rating this movie.,1366416000,,385,4.12
4803839,5,B005LAIII0,"This is an amazing film.  It is the first film I've seen in the theater that uses 3D to truly enhance the story and the movie-going experience.  In 3-D this is a breathtaking movie to watch.  But it is so incredibly well-done that the 2D version is just fine for home viewing, especially on a big-screen TV.",1366416000,2,307,4.350877192982456
4803840,4,B005LAIII0,"This is a very unusual story about a spiritual young man who survives an incredible ordeal at sea. When you get to the story's end, you may find yourself going over it in your mind for days, working out the details. Visually it is gorgeous and awe inspiring at times. A friend who saw it on the big screen said it was even more impressive, and I can see why. But it carries over pretty well to the tv screen as well. Parts of the story are full of adventure as young Pi deals with the tiger on board and brutal storms at sea. I think this movie was difficult to market. It is not a story for little kids about animals, etc.. It is pretty heavy duty philosophically and spiritually. Some of the events may even be too disturbing for young children. Maybe 12 and up or a bit younger for mature kids. If you like to think, if you enjoy philosophy, if you seek God, if you are open to the stories and perspectives of others, you will enjoy this film. It is very well done.",1366416000,,968,4.154255319148936
4803841,5,B005LAIII0,"I heard from friends and reviewers how great this movie is, but the previews made it look so cheesy. So when I finally saw it, I was blown away!

4803843,3,B005LAIII0,"No bad language that I recall and if you like good cgi, it is very impressive in this movie.  The story was a bit lame and I thought the ending was anti-climactic and predictable.  :(  so 2 stars for the story  and 5 for the F/X.  3 average",1366416000,,240,3.9166666666666665

4803882,4,B005LAIII0,"I really liked the book.  That said I accept that a movie can never have as much information in it as a book (unless it is a very short book), and that movies are visual representations of what goes on around a character, and most books tend to look inside the character - thus the translation from books to film has an inherent flaw that will always be there.  That didn't stop me from wanting to see this film, because, c'mon: you just want to SEE the boy on the lifeboat with the tiger from the moment you start to read that section of the book.  In that this movie succeeded very well.  Special effects are getting better and better, and where-as in Jumanji, the CGI animals pulled you out of the movie - these succeed in being believable.  All in all a pretty faithful adaptation, with some very beautiful visuals.",1366416000,,819,4.397350993377484
4803883,3,B005LAIII0,"I had to take the ""middle road"" and give three stars for this movie.

Pros: It had a great theme and there were places that made me actually ""jump out of my seat!"" It was realistic in the continued weight loss of both the lion and the boy. I got the movie in 3D and the intro was really breath taking!

Cons: I couldn't understand much of the conversation in the first part of the movie. Iit was very boring and shot in some low light settings which combined with the low, muffled and heavily accented speech made the movie impossible for me to understand what was taking place!  I couldn't get into the movie until the ""action"" began. I still had a hard time understanding the actor but the action made up for that. After the breath taking intro, I didn't notice very much if any 3D effect throughout the rest of the movie.

All in all, this movie was ""just ok"" but it could have been excellent if  the directors had enhanced the speech so I could have understood what they were saying. :-(",1366416000,,991,4.306451612903226

The visual effects were positively Avatar-like, although I have seen neither in 3-D, only Blu-ray. Even with that limitation on my part, ""Life of Pi"" was a cinematic work of art. Also, the story is a great one. As with ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" it focuses on a young Indian man in a seemingly impossible situation. Suffice to say, adversity grows the soul. But that is where any similarity with ""Slumdog Millionaire"" ends. My best advice is to give this movie a chance and experience its best qualities.

4804688,4,B005LAIII0,"Let me start off by saying the 4 stars are for the movie itself.

The film is quite interesting and very well developed. I wasn't crazy about some of the CGI animals, but overall it was pulled off rather well. I've read other reviews asking why he kept doing a certain thing and it makes me think that maybe people didn't fully understand the movie. Others complained that it was slow, but the pacing seemed fine for this type of film. It's not supposed to be a big action movie so I can't imagine anyone wanting to speed up the story telling. In a lot of ways, it made me think of Ernest Hemingway's book The Old Man and The Sea. It felt very much like that in so many ways, but Pi puts in a little more craziness. Overall, I thought the film was very good and worth the rental fee.

Now, as far as the blu ray disc...it doesn't seem to work in all players. I actually rented the Blu Ray disc and it would not play in my blu ray player. I did the usually stuff like updating the firmware to the latest update. Still, no go. I tried playing it in my computer which has a blu ray player. Nothing. I updated the blu ray software on my comp and still nothing. I did some research and some people have stated that because of a very new type of menu on the blu ray not all players will be able to play it, even with all available updates. It seems that some companies have not updated their software / firmware to make the blu ray work, but I am sure it will be fixed very soon. I had the same problem with the blu ray version of Skyfall. Hopefully, this issue can be worked out as I prefer the clarity of a blu ray over a dvd.

4804689,5,B005LAIII0,The boy who played Pi should have received an Oscar for his performance. It was so magical and real - totally believeable.,1365984000,,122,4.590909090909091
4804690,2,B005LAIII0,"Unfortunately I did not enjoy this movie as much as so many others did.  As a matter of fact I was hugely disappointed.  A friend of mine had encouraged me to see this movie, and rather gushed over it.  ""It was so amazing"", she said.

The strange thing about this movie is it really resembled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tree-Of-Life/dp/B005UKJX4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tree Of Life</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fountain/dp/B000RZAENG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fountain</a>. Although The Life Of Pi definitely had a more developed story than the other two.

I won't go into too much detail, I will however give my customary parent of children warning:  The movie plays on Pi's name where they change it to ""P!ssing"".  And they say ""P!ssing"" over and over.  Over twenty times.  They just won't let it die.  Kids, adults, narrator, everyone is saying it.  Its not that funny and the thick Indian/Hindu dialect makes it so hard to even understand the joke, all you hear is ""P!ssing""!

Then there is the scene where Pi is standing with his back to the camera and you see him urinating on the tarp of the boat.  The animated lion then turns his rear to Pi and sprays Pi in the face with urine. Necessary to the movie? No. Big movie execs thinking the adults will love it? Yes.

And that's the end of my parents with children warning.  Unless of course you want me to cover the many animals that are attacked and die.  But I am sure others have warned you of that.

I believe the story could have been more believable, understanding, or even more enjoyable had they not had the weirdness intermingled in it.  You never know if the story is real or if he is hallucinating.  Even at the end when he is explaining to the investigators what really happened on the ship, he tells two different stories.  Supposedly one is true, but they are both so far out you really don't know which one is true at all.

The human acting was pretty good, however the animation of all of the animals really took away from the story rather than enhance it.

Overall, I would never recommend this movie to anyone. Friend or enemy. I struggle with giving it one star even, but since it wasn't near as bad as The Tree of Life I am going to up it a star.  I wish I could understand and enjoy these ""great"" movies as much as everyone else does.  But I just. don't. get. it.",1365984000,,2468,4.905797101449275

It was a very moving and interesting experience to travel through the life of a young boy's inquisitive mind as he questioned everything about life. His utter trust in God and his journey to find out about all religions fascinated me. His courage and intelligence in a time of crises when most people would have just given up, yet he found a way to tame a wild animal and to survive a sea disaster was totally captivating.

I had no idea it was a best selling book (have since bought the book).  I was left in tears at many parts, due to its beautiful theme and story.  The acting was stellar, pulling you into the character. Cinematography was beyond words on its brilliance, just stunning.  Even my husband loved it all.  My kids still ask me philosophical questions about it, it leaves you with many questions, some that can be answered, some not so easily.  But that is the beauty of it, we never truly know all the answers, do we?",1365897600,,645,4.2809917355371905
4804840,2,B005LAIII0,"I loved the movie itself. It's entertaining, full of anticipation and unexpected.

I started the movie full of hope to watch Pi generously, humbly, search for God and truth. It ended with the modern PC dogma that reduces God and truth to whatever I want to think. It kills the search for truth, because everything is truth. By killing the search for truth and reducing it down to whatever I want to interpret it as, suddenly there is no morality I must adhere to either.

To all those people who voice frustration wondering what was the point of this movie and what was the truth of what happened... you're right on. That's the movie's message about all of life. All religion, science, and morality, comes down to whatever you want to interpret it to be. We all interpret things differently so that means we can all be right at the same time. That everyone can judge what happened to Pi for themselves is completely dissatisfying. We want to know truth, not to make it up.

The father in the movie said that if you believe everything, you believe nothing. Searching for truth is satisfying. Making it up as you go is not.

I recommend this book.

4804846,5,B005LAIII0,"I have noticed some reviews that touch upon the ending of the movie with anger and frustration.  Most ignore the ending all together, as though this were purely a nature or adventure film.  Can one ignore the last half hour of a movie such as The Sixth Sense?  Or, The Usual Suspects, which has a similar ending?

Clearly this is a movie (and novel) about believing, or not believing in God.  The young Pi had a horrible, traumatic experience that he could not (or did not WANT to) remember.  He had to assist in the operation of a sailor with an infected leg, saw the dead sailor being used as bait for food, saw his mother die, saw his mother eaten by sharks, and, then, had to kill a man (the cook) himself.  Who would not want to create an alternative story--one in which God intervenes to make things more bearable?
And, yet, at the end Pi asked people to choose which story they prefered.  This is tantamount to asking someone if they want to believe in reality, which can be cruel, or believe in God, which can be comforting.  That is what this entire movie is about!  Does that make it less appealing than a good adventure story?  Obviously, the answer must be ""YES"" for most people, based on the reviews I have read.",1365897600,2,1225,4.4

4804919,5,B005LAIII0,"This movie has a lot of good things going for it.
1.  The scenery, animation, CGI, etc... is very cool and beautifully done.  One of my favorite visual scenes of the movie, is when PI, sees the ship going down underwater.  It's so unique and well done it just stayed with me through the whole movie.

2.  The Actors who play PI:  First the younger 16 year old PI, played by Suraj Sharma, does an excellent job, and has just the right amount of humor in his voice to make me really like him.  Second, the older PI, played by Suraj Sharma, is a master storyteller, that sucked me in from the beginning.

3.  the story:  it is unique, which today is rare indeed that you would have an original idea.  The ending completely surprised me, and made me love the movie even more.

I truly enjoyed this movie",1365897600,2,799,4.2885906040268456

4805166,4,B005LAIII0,"Ang Lee's film ""Life of Pi"" is a technological marvel, perfectly blending 3D and state of the art digital effects with a great adventure story which is also remarkably spiritual. It all comes together for a deeply moving motion picture experience.

The Blu-ray is stellar as well. The film features some of the best usage of 3D since James Cameron's ""Avatar"" and Martin Scorsese's ""Hugo"". It's perfectly replicated on this 3-disc collector's edition. This set also includes a standard 2D version of the film which also looks amazing. Audio is fully immersive and perfectly replicates the film's sonic power.

The extras are spread over the 2D and 3D Blu-ray discs. These include deleted scenes, a detailed hour-long ""making of"" documentary, and additional features which explore the film's Oscar-winning visual effects. Also included in this version is a DVD copy of the film and digital copies (iTunes & Ultraviolet). Overall, a great value and a great Blu-ray package!",1365897600,,970,5.171974522292993
4805317,5,B005LAIII0,"Ang Lee does a masterful job of bringing this story to life with beautiful computer animation.
Life of PI is about a man who survives a disaster at sea and is hurtled into an epic journey of adventure and discovery. While cast away, he forms an amazing and unexpected connection with another survivor...a fearsome Bengal tiger.

The special effects are breathtaking and fantastically done.  Although the story does start a little slow, the story is masterfully told and keeps you entertained til the end.  The symbolism is amazing and gives you things to consider about which story you would rather hear.

I highly recommend as it is worth a watch and a purchase.  Worthy of all the awards it has received.",1365811200,4,706,4.801652892561983
4805318,4,B005LAIII0,"There are some subtitled parts in this movie, but these sections are brief and not a lot to read, so there shouldn't be too much groaning from those people who hate to have to read subtitles - hopefully knowing this going in will help you not mind so much.

I watched this on my pc via Amazon instant video (not in blu-ray, 3D or even HD) - and I have to say the cinematography is really beautiful!  It is an interesting story - how could someone have thought this up, could this have really happened or is it all someone's imagination?  (It seems it was imagination.)

The movie IS interesting, but as you might guess it would HAVE to be from the type of story it is, it sometimes feels long.  It does make you THINK now and then and so it stays with you, in your thoughts for a good time after the movie has ended.

The different actors used to portray ""PI"" in various stages/ages of his life do not seem to look enough like each other to escape notice - but it's ok.  It doesn't seem to hurt the movie at all, just pointing out that we noticed so you probably will too.

When PI is finally rescued, he is questioned about the loss of the ship (insurance, you know) - and they don't like his story (which you just watched, with the tiger and all) and so they ask him to come up with a more believable story.  When he relates the more believable version, he gets emotional and so you are left to wonder which is really true - and he asks which you prefer to be true.  Then the person PI is telling all this to notes correlation of the characters in each version, and I had to then replay the 2nd ""believable"" version for the insurance people to see that comparison for myself, so I was really glad I saw this on video and not live at the movies where I wouldn't have been able to do that.  ... it is an interesting little twist to the tale I think.

It's a very CLEAN movie so good for the family (though kids have to deal with the subject of how vicious animals can be - which is a good lesson, but you want to be aware of that before a very young child sees this, so you're prepared), and PI is just a likable character - which is a MUST for a successful movie).

I don't know if this is a movie I'd want to watch over and over - but it was one I did enjoy watching, and so I would recommend it to most viewers. (Some great special effects for the storms too!)",1365811200,3,2363,4.088744588744588

4805321,5,B005LAIII0,I was glued to it from the beginning.  Very entertaining but the most poignant scene was the friendship created between the tiger and Pi then the tiger had to be set free.,1365811200,,171,4.34375
4805322,4,B005LAIII0,"This one is worth buying and watching this is a great movie to watch on a rainy night.

Enjoy this movie its a movie about life, trials and tribulations.",1365811200,,153,4.275862068965517
4805323,5,B005LAIII0,"The story of The Life of Pi is relatively simple and yet, rather profound as well.  The basic story revolves around Pi, the main character, relating his story to a writer, about his experiences relating to a journey taken in a lifeboat with his ""friends"" after a storm destroyed the ship he was on with his family while journeying to America.  Since describing this film with too much detail in a review would rob another of the opportunity to simply experience this movie, I don't really want to say much more here.  Besides, if you really want to know, simply go to one of the movie review sites.  I just want to give my own general impressions here without the detail.

There are many who have found The Life of Pi either tedious and over-long or else object to the over-emphasis on ""religion"" and spirituality.  While I never found it tedious or dull, I did not buy into the ""spiritual"" bent of the movie either.  But you don't have to ""buy-in"" to that aspect of the movie in order to enjoy it.  After all, you are an observer and a fellow traveler with Pi and his ""boat-mate(s)"". Again, it is the experience that counts here; not that you have to agree with the beliefs of the main character.

Let me just say here that I am a wannabe 3D artist.  The 3D CG work in this film surpasses anything I have seen to date, including Avatar which I also loved.  I've enjoyed many other 3D works such as Toy Story, etc, but The Life of Pi is, as they say, in a league all it's own when it comes to the CG work.  I simply would not have believed this depth of realism was even possible and I'm directly involved in it!  It is this very sense of realism that brings this film to life and puts you in the boat and elsewhere with Pi.  Absolutely masterful work.

The Life of Pi is rated PG.  I have raised 5 kids and I don't think I would want to bring younger kids to this movie.  It is simply too intense for most younger children, in my opinion.  I really think that PG13 would have probably been more appropriate.  That, of course, depends on the maturity of each child.  Some younger kids could handle it just fine.  Like all such things, you've just got to know your kids.  Just be warned before plunking one of your little ones down in front of this.

The Life of Pi is not a perfect film and certainly has it's flaws.  I found the ending particularly confusing and even a bit frustrating. I won't tell you why because that would give too much away.  But for me, at least, that was it's greatest and most serious flaw.  Yes, the religious mumbo jumbo was a little much sometimes.  Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  It provided me with a movie-going experience that I will never forget.  I can't say that about too many films any more.",1365811200,3,2745,4.337917485265226

4805325,5,B005LAIII0,Ang Lee is a daring and ambitious director and his decision to take on this otherwise unfillmable story turns it into one of the very few 3D masterpieces.,1365811200,2,154,4.535714285714286
4805326,3,B005LAIII0,"I will start by saying I did not read this book, so I watched this movie with a clean slate and no sentimental history with the story.

I found this movie to be decent, but I would never willingly sit through a second viewing of it. The special effects were impressive, and cinematography was beautiful.

However, I was not a big fan of the story nor the plot. Also, the movie was a bit too long to keep my interest. Nevertheless, I was entertained for most of the movie. There is good humor sprinkled throughout, and production quality was excellent. Families with children may enjoy this movie given the settings, abundance of animals in the movie, and an all in all uncontroversial story.

I would not recommend this movie to most of my friends, and I certainly would not recommend them to buy it. Unless you have read the book and love the story, I would recommend this as more of a rental if you are set on watching it, and not so much as one to keep in your library.",1365811200,,972,4.359116022099448

When I got home, my wife and I were looking for a movie to download, and she had wanted to see it. Mostly curious to put a soundtrack to what I had seen on over 40 ours of flights, I agreed.

On almost all DVDs the options for playing scenes, or total film are clearly stated as the DVD opens; that does not happen with this DVD. There were 3 discs in the Collector's Edition I purchased. One disc offered the 3D version, and after we finally got out of the trailer loop we got to see the film. The second disc is the non 3D version, and the third disc is supposed to offer behind the scenes details involved in the making of the film. It is impossible to get  beyond the trailer loop in the third disc after trying every possible routine that normally works on DVDs. I was sharing the experience with 6 well informed DVD users; they all tried to get the discs to run properly, and they also could not understand why these DVDs are so devoid of instructions on screen or in the printed material. Loved the film, hated the technology or lack of it.",1365724800,,1129,4.300469483568075

Having read the book after the film (did not ruin the reading), the book club discussion I participated in agreed that the movie, unlike most, was better than the book! That director, Ang Lee took such a challenging story line and turned it into an unbelievably stunning movie shows bravery, daring and ... creative genius! While watching this movie on the big screen movie theater was spectacularly larger than life, the DVD Blue Ray (and likely, the regular DVD) is still equally awe-inspiring! The story line of this movie is inspiring, beautiful and thought-provoking.

When I finished watching Life of Pi it was as if an explosion occurred in my brain. I have watched numerous films in the past where all is great except the ending and I cringe in frustration but the ending of this film is genius. The words of adult Pi, especially, when referring to Richard Parker (the tiger) made me weep. This is and will forever be my all-time favorite film. PERFECTION!",1365638400,,603,4.592592592592593

4806085,3,B005LAIII0,"From my friends and other reviews, I expected this movie to be an inspiration and spiritual story, but you hardly find anything inspiration or spiritual in it. It is a somewhat gruesome story of survival. The plot is interesting, cinematography breathtaking, and acting excellent, but after watching this movie, your do not feel an awe for the strength of human spirit that overcome tremendous challenges, or serenity of God's presence, surrender, understanding or even clarity. The movie leaves you feeling like a witness to a very traumatic, very gruesome, and very tragic situation with no hope really. Till the end you cannot distinguish fantasy of the main character from the reality of what happened, but that in itself is not a minus to the movie, its just facing a gruesome reality or facing the more beautiful and metaphoric view of the same reality, but nevertheless without hope or a presence of God.",1365638400,,911,5.0

4806087,3,B005LAIII0,"While the gorgeous cinematography of this movie alone makes it worth seeing, I wasn't impressed with it overall.  A man retells the events that he experienced as a boy during and after a shipwreck with zoo animals and his family.  The promise is made early on that this is a story that will ""make you believe in God.""  If this, indeed, is the purpose of the film, it failed miserably.  On that front, it was confusing at best.  I think it would be much more accurate to say, ""This is a story that explains how some people view religion and ecumenicalism.""  On the positive side, it does make the viewer think long after the show's over, but by the time I was done thinking, my analysis was that I didn't agree with the author.  Eh, it was probably worth seeing, but it's definitely not going to make my top 100 list.",1365638400,3,816,4.364238410596027

4806145,4,B005LAIII0,"Although it's boring in the beginning of the movie. But it start to get exciting after Pi was lost in the middle of the sea.

The story line is so good that it try to prove God existence. In the end, there when he share his story, the real story and the fake story, people chose to believe the fake story. That's because people don't believe what they don't see, but it exists. Just like God is anywhere but we can't see God, we can only believe without hesitation.

Also, I like the scene, it's so beautiful especially the night with some shinning livings in the sea.

It is one to be felt. I suspect that it is one that changes in time as you change as well. I am sure there are as many interpretations as there are viewers, so I will not even comment on that part. All I will say is ""Feel it!""

4806316,5,B005LAIII0,"This is the most artistic use of 3D I have seen on Blu-ray to date.
Watching the BD inspired me to read the book by Yann Martel. The film follows the book religiously. (No pun intended). Nothing of importance is left out. The visuals of the movie matched the narrative of the book as I read. Purists will be pleased.
The DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 (48kHz, 24-bit) audio is superb.
Ang Lee richly deserved the Best Director Award he received at the Oscars for this masterpiece. This is reference audio and video.

The use of CGI in this film is fantastic. Every scene you see where the tiger is alone in the frame is a real tiger. I challenge you to tell the difference between the real and the CGI tiger.

A bit about the story. This is not a religious movie per se. It is the portrayal of a boy who finds himself in a horrendous situation, fraught with peril. He must draw on all he has learned and experienced in his young life to cope with the reality of the moment. It is a testament to the human will to survive against all odds. An uplifting experience.
This should not be missed.",1365552000,5,1083,4.303921568627451

4806320,4,B005LAIII0,"Aside from the movie content being a little slow (like the book), this movie was beautiful in 3D.  The tiger looked a lot more real that I thought he would in CG.  If you liked the movie Cast Away with Tom Hanks, you'll probably like this one.  Similar single man surviving incredible odds in tough/life threatening environment type of story.

4806321,4,B005LAIII0,"This movie was a story of survival. It featured a boy on a boat in the middle of the ocean for the majority of the film. There were some long, drawn out parts that could have been shortened. My kids (12, 11, 9) sat through the entire thing, but all of us agreed we would probably never watch it again. The graphics were nice, lots of bright colors and scenes. The violence was mild, there were some animals that were killed. The ending was surprising (no spoiler alert) but tied the whole movie together so it made more sense. I don't recommend it for children younger than 9 who don't like killing animals though. Good one time movie, glad we only rented it. Nice way to pass a chilly afternoon.",1365552000,,696,4.361538461538461

Is this not also the story of a young person learning to control the wildness in himself while trying to survive the relentless storms which life throws at him ?

I don't know how they made the animals do the great job that they did without doing damage to the young actor. The story line was enough to keep my attention and the special effects were excellent.

After reading it, I found myself resisting seeing the movie because I couldn't imagine how it could be realized, including that I thought if they were faithful to the story it would be both gory and grim. With the awards it won and consistently strong word of mouth from people I trust, I decided to watch. I found myself with time last weekend and ordered it and was blown away. Incredibly beautiful, with saturated, lush, better-than-the-real-thing colors for both the land and sea shots. Because it captures both the spirit and faithfully tells the story it is one of the best adaptations of a novel I've ever seen. Because of the emphasis placed on an alternative path for the story, I even understood the novel in a different and deeper way. The experience stayed with me all the next day.

4807154,5,B005LAIII0,"Life stories aren't always happy.  Pi's life is no exception.  It will fill you full of awe at times, but it will show you lows of great trajedy as well.  It is indeed an adventure, mostly of a young boy and young man. As a young boy his life was tormented by his full name, but filled with joy of learning about religion and animals in his families Zoo.  In time his family must sell out and board a freighter with some of their animals.  Trajedy strikes deep on that voyage, but Pi and a tiger survive.  Their adventure on the high seas is indeed full of wonder, but measured with the struggle of finding water and food.  Pi ends up telling us two stories and letting us decide which we like best.  I like the one with the tiger and I think you will too.  Great directing, acting, production values, and absolutely gorgeous camera work.

My husband and I just didn't like this movie, ""Life of Pi"".  However, we have really liked all other Ang Lee films.

""Life of Pi"" was too self-conscious..................you always got the feeling that the film makers were saying something like, ""look how artsy we are to be taking this (not) provocative subject matter...........and using beautiful colors and sound, we can convince the audience to go along with anything.""  The plot was boring and tedious and we couldn't wait for it to finish.

How could a movie about a boy trapped on a life boat with a man eating tiger be that interesting? Well I took a chance and purchased it on DVD while it was on sale and I must say, this movie ROCKS!!!! It was nothing like I had imagined it to be. The story was touching and it is a visual masterpiece. Richard Parker(the tiger) was enough to keep you on the edge of your seat and Pi Patel(Suraj Sharma) was a remarkable character. Determined to live this boy fights the elements and finds the inner strength that we all possess. A great film for the entire family(though I was a little upset with the Zebra and Arangatang scene).

4807479,5,B005LAIII0,"I sat on the sofa with my husband and teen aged children. I knew Life of Pi had won awards but I needed to read reviews before deciding whether to watch it. I read the reviews on Amazon before watching this movie. In fact I usually come to Amazon before making a final decision on a film. The part that baffles me is the negative reviews of this film. I don't understand why anyone would have compared this to Avatar or why anyone after watching the entire film would bother bringing Avatar up. The only reason I can fathom as to why anyone would dislike this movie is if they didn't understand it. And that in itself baffles me too. Visually, this movie was stunning. Period. The cinematography and effects were gorgeous. Gorgeous not like Avatar...gorgeous like Life of Pi. The two are two very very different types of movie. But by the end of this movie I knew that it was not just a film for entertainment sake or about visual effects. It was human, raw, and frankly the story isn't about the tiger, it's about the boy who survived. The story is his. No matter what the real ending is, matters not. What matters is that we as humans face sometimes the most unfathomable trials and challenges and how we handle them is entirely up to us. When I finished watching this and I was done wiping my tears away, I knew I wanted to see it again. Somehow I felt like the lessons in the story weren't all going to be caught on the first try. It is worth watching again for the parts I may have missed. I was in awe of the cast and how effortlessly they played their parts. There were times when I laughed, times when I cried, times when I cringed and that is what a movie experience is supposed to be. No, that is what story telling is supposed to be. This film most definitely deserved academy awards. And I'll end this review...this very simplistic review with saying that I feel sorry for those that hated this movie. They missed out on the powerful message and the beautiful story. I can only be glad for myself that I got to experience Pi's story. I know I was transformed. .",1365206400,5,2073,4.345360824742268

Well, I went to my son's at Easter (He usually shows some after-dinner action flick with car chases.), he started his Blu-Ray, and ""The Life of Pi"" was emblazoned across his giant screen. I thought well, guess I'm stuck watching it. Within five minutes I was caught, spellbound, not only by the stunning beauty of the visual images but also by the flawless portrayals of the actors who were so natural that they didn't seem to be acting. Almost unawares I was so swept up with the story that I easily suspended my disbelief and was very close to tears at the utter beauty of what I was seeing. ""The Life of Pi"" is a cinematic masterpiece.

Of many scenes of magnificent beauty, the one in which the golden sky blended into the sea simply blew me away. The film is so astonishing that I quickly forgot my bias against CGI.

And I didn't mind the two endings. Whether the more prosaic version was the truth or not is irrelevant. For me, it provided a framework for the layered symbolism of the 'romantic' narrative.

Ang Li's visual motifs are reminiscent of the verbal motifs of Greek tragedy. They penetrate deeply into the psychology of the characters. The blurring of the boundaries between illusion and reality--the very ambiguity of 'what actually happened'--makes me want to watch the picture over and over, as there is so much to savour.

Trying to think what I like about this movie.  The glow in the dark water and the cool whale breaching.  I love tigers and it hurt my eyes watching even an animated tiger slowly starve (or nearly starve to death).  The zebra would have been screaming in agony and should have been destroyed.  At once.  Instead of being put through even more trauma by the rocking pitching motion of the boat.

Oh, but that would be realism...showing the resulting pain that would come from a broken leg.

4807629,5,B005LAIII0,"I'm going to focus my review mainly on the 3D aspect of this Blu-Ray, and about how the movie compares to Avatar 3D-wise, which is to date the visual benchmark by which other 3D movies are judged. As for the movie itself it's an amazing piece of film-making whose plot and pace reminded me of the movie Castaway.

Now, onto the 3D:

When I originally watched the movie Avatar in theaters, its 3D effect blew my mind. For me, that movie is the benchmark all 3D movies should aspire to achieve, when it comes to 3D implementation. Over the years, and after watching avatar in the theater, I've watched a mixed bag of 3D movies that initially led me to believe 3D in the living room would never achieve the quality of what I watched in the theater when Avatar knocked my socks off and introduced me to the world of modern 3D. Then, after a period of exclusivity with Panasonic, Avatar 3D was finally made available on Blu-Ray. To my surprise, after watching avatar in 3D Blu-Ray in the comfort of my living room, it looked EXACTLY the same as in the theater. Perfect. Visually astounding. And one HUGE detail: Crosstalk free. (For the uninitiated, crosstalk if the effect present in many 3D movies in which the edges of objects on the screen look blurry and doubled. Many people not only find this effect annoying but it's known to case headaches and even nausea in many moviegoers). The fact that Avatar was 100% crosstalk free led me to one conclusion: 3D Blu Rays can look every bit as good in your living room as the movie originally looked on the theater screen, as long as the movie is done right, shot right and encoded right. Just like James Cameron did with Avatar. Which finally brings me to Life of Pi.

This Blu Ray movie packs the best 3D I've seen, after the hundred or so movies that have graced my TV screen since avatar. The 3D effect in Life of Pi is absolutely flawless. Crosstalk is absolutely non-existent. I can't stress this enough. The fact that this movie nails its 3D presentation and it contains zero crosstalk whatsoever, along with the masterful way in which director Ang Lee shot this movie take your movie experience to a whole new level. When you're watching the movie the absence of crosstalk allows you to forget for a second you're watching a Blu-Ray movie and that you-re wearing the stupid glasses and simply allows you to immerse yourself in the visuals. Your eyes get used to the new dimension they're perceiving instantly and you end up losing yourself in the lush landscapes and in the incredibly rich color palette this movie brings to your living room. The colors are so vibrant, the objects  so sharp and defined you almost feel you're looking through a glass.

Unlike gimmicky 3D movies that try to impress you by throwing objects at your face, the 3D effect in Life of Pie is used instead to immerse the viewer in this fantastic world. It's done tastefully, technically impeccably and with amazing results. And unlike said gimmicky 3D movies in which you feel like you're just watching a 2D movie with dark glasses 90% of the time, and the 3D is just reserved for fast paced action scenes that make up probably 10% of the movie, in Life of Pi 3D is present on the screen almost 99% of the time. Like it's one more color the director was able to play with when painting this masterpiece. You don't need to wait for an action scene to see the 3D in all its glory. As soon as the movie starts and you're presented with the lush visuals of an Indian zoo, you see the 3d in all its glory. 2 minutes into the movie the narrative takes you to the protagonist's living room where he is having a conversation with a book writer. Two characters sitting in a living room talking. A scene that most 3D movies wouldn't even consider introducing 3D on, (let alone using their 3D budget to enhance), yet in Life of Pi, as mundane as a scene like this could be, is giving the royal 3D treatment and you see the characters, perfectly defined in the foreground, and the rest of the living room, purposefully out of focus in the background, like if it is the background of the actual living room you're sitting in.

Whereas avatar is a CGI fest, (and that's a flavor of movie I also certainly enjoy) In terms of visual effects, Life of Pi is just a different animal. CGI, while definitely existent, is only one, amongst many aces under the  director's sleeve. He also plays, with color, (and boy does he!) contrast, angles, landscapes, and also the masterful 3D implementation to submerge you in the story.

To sum it up, not only is this an amazing movie totally worth watching, but this 3D Blu-Ray is one you will definitely want to keep on your shelf whenever you want to show your 3D setup to your friends. Along with avatar, it is in my opinion the finest example of 3D done right you can have in your collection. Definitely reference material for 3D quality, and also proof that whenever you get crosstalk ridden cheaply done 3D movies, is not because the technology is not there yet but because the movie was not shot or encoded properly, and basically they were cheap, lazy, or both. The technology to make your living room 3D look as good as the best theater 3D can offer, is definitely there. And Ang Lee took it and ran with it.",1365120000,24,5263,4.503664921465969

4807631,4,B005LAIII0,"As a voracious reader, I feel the need to preface this review by saying that I have not read the book this film was based on. Not sure if I ever will, but there it is, I haven't. And thankfully it's not one of those ""you HAVE to read the book to understand the movie"" type of things. I thought the film started off slow, but it helped establish Pi's character rather than just toss him on a lifeboat with a tiger and wait to see what character development happens afterward. The reason for going by ""Pi"" was creative. And the telling of the story via flashbacks was a good choice; you got the sense that even so many years later, Pi still carries all of this with him every single day. The actors appeared very well cast in their roles -- I liked that Lee cast a lot of unknowns (or at least, unfamiliar to the Western world), because then you weren't distracted by preconceived notions of the actors' abilities and you could focus on the story the film was telling. Suraj Sharma did a particularly spectacular job, considering how his tiger companion was a character completely created in CGI. From a technical standpoint, Life of Pi deserved every Oscar it scored (Visual Effects, Director, Score, Cinematography). The score was subtle but stirring when it needed to be, and seemed to evoke more emotionally than the actors could, probably due to Pi's somewhat stagnant position on the lifeboat in the middle of the ocean. The night scene stands out to me as far as effects, score and cinematography are concerned because it just takes your breath away; between the infinite number of stars and the bright reflections of fish underwater to the breaching humpback, the entire scene was incredible to watch. And enough praise cannot be bestowed on the crew who worked to bring not just Richard Parker but all the other animals to life as well -- they all acted very realistically in regard to each other and to Pi himself. I have friends who've seen this film and thought it extremely boring -- maybe it's jsut me, but I can't understand how something so intriguing could bore someone. Broaden your mind with this film, it's a good one.",1365120000,2,2136,4.608923884514436

4807883,4,B005LAIII0,"For its technical accomplishments alone, Ang Lee's LIFE OF PI is likely to rank at the top of the list of 2012's best for many viewers, and there's no doubt from an artistic standpoint, its visuals were unmatched by any other film last year.

An adaptation of Yann Martel's seemingly impenetrable rumination on the triumph of the human spirit, man's place in the universe, and the role of religion in an individual's spiritual journey, ""Life of Pi"" is, first and foremost, a film for the senses. Working from a script by David Magee, director Lee's film follows ""Pi"" Patel (Suraj Sharma), a young man who learns of different religions growing up in the Puducherry region of what was once French India. His inquisitive nature, both encouraged by his mother (Tabu) and discouraged by a father (Adil Hussain) who operates a zoo in their town, is scuttled as he grows older and his family is eventually forced to immigrate to Canada. En route, the Japanese freighter carrying them, as well as their zoo animals, is wrecked in a storm, with only Pi escaping - alongside a zebra, orangutan, hyena, and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker, who journeys with Pi on an ocean teeming with both peril and wonder, with florescent jellyfish lighting up the world beneath them and humpback whales catapulting through the air.

""Life of Pi"" is so staggeringly, jaw-droppingly beautiful that Lee and cinematographer Claudia Miranda's effective use of the 3-D format is evident from the movie's first frames. Long before Pi and Richard Parker set out on a lifeboat of individual discovery, ""Life of Pi"" has already captivated the viewer with its fascinating portrait of young Pi's life in French India, with gorgeous landscapes, colors and animals filling each and every frame. Most of the movies we see using 3-D employ it merely as a gimmick to goose grosses, but much like Martin Scorsese's ""Hugo,"" Lee here frames so many sequences with depth-of-field dimension that its inclusion ranks as an absolute necessity to appreciating the spellbinding images that Lee and Miranda - both of whom were deservedly honored with Oscars, alongside composer Mychael Danna and the visual effects team at Rhythm & Hues - generated here.

The film's story is another matter; one can easily see why readers of Martel's book were drawn to the material, for its mostly ambiguous, take-out-what-you-put-in take on world religion and faith, in general, functions mostly as a byproduct of the individual reader. On-screen, Lee is able to invest the material with a similar cloudiness, though that ambiguity is harder to achieve in a medium like film. There's no outright sermonizing in the picture, but its ending is more forcefully tilted in one direction than the more hazy conclusion Martel originally wrote. Still, however obvious (or not) the film's metaphorical messages and spiritual philosophizing happen to be, there's no question ""Life of Pi"" is a film that's impossible to forget and easy to appreciate on a sheer artistic level. Whether or not you find it to be as enriching an emotional journey will be - much like its source material - up to the individual viewer.

Fox's 3-D Blu-Ray presentation of ""Life of Pi"" is unquestionably a must-view for any 3-D home theaterphile. The images, composition and clarity of the 3-D are spectacular throughout, and as I wrote before, few films have demanded viewing in the 3-D format more than ""Life of Pi."" The 3-D Blu-Ray also includes nearly 15 minutes of exclusive deleted scenes, plus the trailer in 3D and visual effects progressions (these exclusive extras can also be played in a standard BD player). Other supplements on the standard Blu (which features a dazzling 1080p AVC encoded transfer in its own right) boast several featurettes, an art gallery and storyboards, while a DVD and digital copy round out the disc. The DTS MA 7.1 audio is impressively mounted as well, highlighting another fine score written by Danna for his long-time cinematic collaborator.

One final note on ""Life of Pi"": it's inconceivable to me that this picture generated a PG rating from the MPAA. With its marketing campaign dominated by images of Pi and the tiger together in the lifeboat, I have no doubt there were parents who took children to this film, only to be horrified by the animal violence that occurs in it - even if it's off-camera and isn't gratuitous, this isn't a film for young kids, and should've absolutely received a PG-13 for that and the generally intense tone of the picture. Of course, this isn't the first sign our ratings system is dysfunctional - merely the latest evidence of it.",1365033600,3,4612,4.953488372093023
4807884,5,B005LAIII0,"Ang Lee's presentation of the Life of Pi was a delight to me. I loved this book when I first read it, and I had trouble getting it out of my head for months.  My experience with movies made from books that I have loved has been mixed - some of the movies have been enjoyable and some have been disappointing, all for many and varied reasons, so I settled down in front of the flat screen TV to watch Life of Pi with my best open mind.

Although it has been a few years since I read the book, the movie brought it back to me in waves of memories.  The film was visually stunning to me (You must stream this movie in HD to be stunned), and I didn't feel cheated by not having it in 3D, since the 5.1 surround sound was enough realism for me.  The tiger was magnificently created and was as real to me as any real tiger could be.  The love that Pi and Richard Parker shared developed as tenderly as any love story could, and showed the reality of human misperception of ""taming"" a wild animal. Pi was convincinly played as an adorable, if somewhat irascible, young man and as an engaging, deeply thoughtful adult.

As with the book, the movie left me totally satisfied with the experience of the story, and with renewed questions about which version of Pi's story was really real. As with the book, in the end it didn't matter to me, because the story was so engaging, so entertaining and so lovely.",1365033600,4,1396,4.249056603773585

4808417,5,B005LAIII0,"The writing is spectacular for this film.  It is an incredible story with some religious underlying.

We saw this in 3D at the theaters when it first came out.  It's still a great movie even watching it now.

The plot is laid out very well.  It doesn't have much of a hook in the beginning though - so expect a little slow at first.  However, the exposition and back story of Pi's life now and then is very good - especially how he got his name.  Each character has very good traits.  Because it's mostly about Pi, I like how the movie gives just enough exposition of his family to better understand him.

This is a movie you have to pay attention to because the ending ties together some things and has a bit of a twist.

Definitely worth the buy.",1364947200,,748,4.24113475177305

4808490,5,B005LAIII0,"I was a little worried at the beginning of Pi (first 5 minutes or so) as I thought the dialogue was a little slow. Then, Pi began his journey and I was entranced. At the end of the movie, I felt that it was one of the best movies I had ever seen and I realized the dialogue was, in fact, necessary and an important part of the tale.  This is an extremely unique movie with incredible characters, humor, sadness, and thought provoking moments all rolled into one.  The Life of Pi is a fantastic escape from the violent, floor shaking movies we have grown used to. Instead, The Life of Pi takes us on a life journey of self preservation and, does it so beautifully and with such entertaining script that, in the end, we don't even know we've been on a journey.

4808497,5,B005LAIII0,"This film is truly exceptional.  It is also very difficult.  I do not want to ruin the experience for you so I offer a few pieces of advice while watching and nothing more...

1.  Keep an open mind.  There are many messages that are not fully revealed until the end.  This is made more difficult because these seemingly separate messages do tie in to a much broader message that is revealed almost simultaneously.

2.  The VFX are spectacular but the film is not meant to be a spectacle.  There is meaning to be found in almost every component of the story.

3.  When finished, research the story.  Specifically the names of characters and how they are related to actual historical events.

4.  Enjoy and suspend disbelief...  This is a carefully nuanced piece of art intended to affect change in the viewer.

It is my belief this story is intended to change the world.  Not that it actually will but the message is incredibly broad and idealistic.  Some people may find the message reassuring while others may find it disturbing.  What worries me is that in many ways this is art for artists.  It requires analysis and information beyond what is presented but that is part of it's beauty.",1364860800,2,1189,4.625

4808757,4,B005LAIII0,"LIFE OF PI is visually stunning.  I observed tigers at close quarters for years as a volunteer at a preserve for big cats.  I was completely fooled by the CGI in the creation of ""Richard Parker,"" although I began to catch on when the tiger did things it was difficult for me imagine a tiger doing, like climbing into a boat or catching and eating a live rat flung at it.  In terms of the story, these moves seemed possible, given the extreme circumstances the tiger was in.  I just wasn't sure of a real tiger, a Hollywood working animal, being successfully trained to do these things.

The action at heart is an old-fashioned adventure tale of survival at sea with an unusual twist, told more with humor than desperation.  It strives to present the story as a spiritual one, but like the journalist (an off-putting performance by Rafe Spall.  Why would a stranger open up to this blank, boring boob?) I was underwhelmed by that aspect.  The ""inspirational"" thrust felt scrambled and overreaching, and once Pi is at sea, secondary.  I had only a tenuous idea by the end what all this was supposed to have to do with God.  Part of the problem may have been the sound in the all-important reveal Pi makes to the insurance investigators at the end.  Suraj Sharma's accent was too thick and his speech too fast for me to catch a lot of what he said.  Was it me, or was the sound poorly handled in this scene?  I've seen the film three times--still can't get it all.

But I got the tiger.  Who hasn't felt at times trapped, abandoned, marooned, to face a proverbial tiger of some sort in our own lives completely on our own?  When Pi attributes his survival to Richard Parker for keeping him alert and active, the emotional truth resonated.  Overcoming a challenge to survival has been the making of many a man or woman.

The greatness of this film lies not in its metaphors but in its awesome visual sweep.  I've never seen water look so crystal clear on screen.  Its appearance alone carries mystical implications.  The movie needs to be seen on the big screen to get its full meaning, for on the big screen the water not only thrills but illuminates.  Note that in the editorial review above, Kathleen Fennessey compares the brutal storm in this movie to TITANIC.  Puzzling, as there is no ""horrific"" storm in TITANIC.  Perhaps she meant to compare it to THE PERFECT STORM--whatever--but she's got her storms, and her movies, scrambled.  The water effects in LIFE OF PI range from being as shimmering and evocative as a Monet painting, to being a terrifying cataclysm.  TITANIC has nothing to compare with it.  In LIFE OF PI, the water is alive, one of the primary characters, and makes the movie come alive.",1364860800,,2706,4.571725571725572

The 3D experience enhances the story that the whole family can enjoy. Richard Parker, the tiger, is rendered believable and at times menacing but the plot would not work without him. As we now own this 3D movie we will watch it often.",1364774400,,372,4.485294117647059

4808981,5,B005LAIII0,"I had to see this alone, 3D, in the theater. And I'm glad I bit the bullet and did. Because it's absolutely gorgeous. To me, it's the best use of visual effects to tell a story since the first ""Star Wars"" movie. But, I realized, I didn't totally get it. I watched it a second time after I bought the disc from Amazon, with my fiance, who hadn't seen it, and she, er, explained some stuff to me. And I like it even more now.

I didn't thing Ang Lee should've gotten the Oscar for Best Director...but now I do. It's a superb film and I highly recommend it for those appreciate craftsmanship, non-linear storytelling and breathtaking visuals. Two subtle thumbs WAY up.",1364774400,,665,4.40650406504065

I am so glad I didn't wait because the movie was extremely thoughtful and presented a great deal of reflection in our lives. It is too bad that this movie was passed over for the Best Movie of the Year. I saw Argo and was very disappointed in it and know that it was given the Best Picture of the Year because of Movie Politics. Never again will I ever believe any rating that is given by the Movie Picture Academy Awards staff. They suck to put it mildly.

I highly recommend this movie but not for little ones as they may get bored and there is one scene where the momma gorilla is killed and I don't think that would be good for little ones.  Other than that I love this film.,1364688000,,317,4.25

But this is a philosophy movie at the heart, and a message for the unsure masses at the end. I'm glad it's part of our cultural discussion at least.

I'm planning to read the book now.",1364688000,,317,4.266666666666667

4809105,3,B005LAIII0,"We watched this on our family movie night with our daughters ages 10 and 13, without having read any reviews or having any idea of what the movie is about.  Our 10 year old thought it was scary, but huddled close to her dad and made it through the whole thing.  The movie and plot is quite engaging; it's hard to know what is ""real"" and what is imagined -- until the end.  It was too metaphorical for our kids to understand -- and that is probably a good thing, given what the main character had to do to survive.  It was pretty thought-provoking -- after-the-fact -- for the adults who watched.  Our kids watched the whole thing, but they really didn't enjoy it very much.",1364601600,2,673,4.309523809523809
4809106,5,B005LAIII0,"So many reviews talk about the quality of the film as if your average customer is a certified critic. My review will only serve to say that the SPECIAL FEATURES on this disc are EXEMPLARY! I actually cried during the stories Ang Lee and Suraj talked about. This movie should have won the Oscar for best picture (not that Argo shouldn't have) , but they did give Best Director to Ang Lee and some other crucial Oscars to this film. Altogether, this is now one of my favorite blurays particularly because of the quality of the special features. Much like the quality that was on the Lord of The Rings Movies. This is a great transfer with worthwhile extras!",1364601600,,655,4.512605042016807
4809107,4,B005LAIII0,"Life of Pi is an emotional story, but well balanced. Tension builds but is released with some genuinely humorous lines, and none of it seems overplayed. If you've seen the trailer, you know that a boy ends up shipwrecked with a tiger. So - you'll spend the first bit of the movie wondering how this happens, and the second half of the movie wondering how he manages to make it out alive - that was enough to keep me keen to watch. And yes, he spends a long time in that boat, but that's how the story goes. After awhile I started to get antsy - when is he finally going to get out of that blasted boat?! That's just a snippet of the emotion that Pi must have endured. Any movie that makes me feel what the character feels is a winner in my book, and it happened throughout the movie.

I am not a spiritual person and I definitely had to chew on the closing lines for a bit until I was satisfied with its meaning. If you don't want to reflect on life a bit, perhaps you should skip this film.

My only complaint - fabulous acting and filming, but some of the CGI was distracting. Maybe it looked better in 3D at the theater?",1364601600,4,1123,4.146788990825688

I a little worried, as some movies made from books just do not get it ""right"". This movie really does. Of course the movie doesn't cover everything that happened in the book, but it does cover enough to tell the story and convey the strong emotions that it should.

There is a twist when things wind up in the end.  One I was not expecting.  Beautifully shot.  A feast for the eyes.  Highly recommended. A story of survival of the body and the soul.,1364601600,,344,4.2

4810034,5,B005LAIII0,"Ang Lee's ""Life of Pi"" is a masterpiece of state-of-the-art film making, a beautiful creation that tells a moving story in heart-touching way.

Starting from the very opening credits, it is a gorgeous film to watch.  Filmed in vibrant color and mostly natural settings, with animals featured in many scenes, it is more visually stunning than any nature documentary I've ever seen.  The scenes at sea, both at night under the stars and during the day, under a wide variety of different ocean conditions, show the true beauty and terrifying power of the open ocean.  Certainly some of the scenes, especially the phosphoresence scenes, are computer enhanced, but the net effect is spectacular.

The animals, especially the Bengal tiger, are the costars of the movie, and their actions are incredibly lifelike and true to their animal nature.  This is no Disney film - in only one short scene does the tiger exhibit any humanlike traits.  I have no idea how Ang Lee actually created and captured these animal scenes on film - the special effects are so good, with no hints of fakery, that you will believe that all the scenes really were filmed at sea with the lead actor on a small boat alongside a hungry, vicious tiger.  This is present-day special effects at its absolute best, and in service to a movie that is not a science fiction shoot-em-up.  Impressive.

The movie's story is about stories: how they are created and retold, and the impact they have on people.  ""Life of Pi"" has some interesting things to say about religion, because the documents at the heart of all major religions are effectively books of stories, very little of which can actually be proven or verified to have happened.  Pi's story about what happened at sea on his boat where he was the only human survivor is no different, and when you can't scientifically verify something, the question becomes what do you believe?  ""Life of Pi"" leaves it to the viewer to decide.

""Life of Pi"" is quite an achievement for director Ang Lee.  I think I know why Hollywood voted the ""Hollywood saves the day"" film Argo as the Oscar's Best Picture of 2012, but ""Life of Pi"" is a far better and much more memorable movie.",1364342400,7,2181,4.717678100263853

4810038,4,B005LAIII0,I enjoyed this movie.  The special effects were well done and really captured the heart of the story. I was intrigued by the suggestion that the mind is a powerful tool for masking the harsh realities of survival.,1364256000,,213,4.605263157894737
4810039,4,B005LAIII0,Interesting generally sad movie.  Was nominated for many awards and the boat scenes I wonder how they did it.  I should have rented it instead.,1364256000,,143,4.68

4810105,5,B005LAIII0,It plays perfectly on this Kindle Fire and I stop it and start...absolutely beautiful.  I would like to watch it on my television.  Is there a way to save it to our Dish system?,1364256000,,177,4.176470588235294

4810150,4,B005LAIII0,I did not read the book but now would like to have more detail although the film is very good and never gets too sentimental.  Love the twist at the end where you are not sure what really happened.,1364256000,,197,4.051282051282051

4810153,4,B005LAIII0,"It was very well written and cast. It has vivid scenes of brilliant color that make it a beautiful movie to watch, and moments that stir every emotion throughout the movie. I was captivated by the journey and the ocean was as much a lead character as Richard Parker, the tiger.  It had twists and turns that I never anticipated and can honestly say that this movie was an experience that moved me to tears.  I's not for the faint hearted.  The ocean is relentless in being both friend and foe.  If you're looking for an experience of a most unusual story and cast of characters, this would well be worth your time.  I'm still thinking about it days after seeing it.  It's rare for me to be so moved by a movie.  I like it very much but doubt that I could ever watch it again.  Knowing the story makes it a once in a lifetime event for me.  It's captivating and powerful.",1364256000,3,870,4.2560975609756095
4810154,5,B005LAIII0,"I will admit that when i first saw the trailer for this, i misjudged this movie. I thought to myself ""what a ridiculous looking  movie."" But recently I found out I was completely dead wrong about this Film. I do not know where to begin. Suraj Sharma plays the title character Pi and he does it realistically. Pi is everything I would hope to be in his situation: brave, courageous, and daring. This movie also proves (and does a really good job at it) that help can come from the most unlikely ally. That being said, the storyline is top notch in this film and it is deeply moving. The supporting cast is good, but the surprise in this film (and i think many will agree) are the effects and visuals. Ang Lee Deserves not only a tip of the hat, but in my opinion he deserves a standing ovation for making such an enjoyable film. Quoting one of the lines from the film ""I was told you have a story that would make me believe in God,""  And in my honest opinion, this film has done that and so much more. 5 stars",1364256000,5,1008,4.190721649484536

I guess I'm weird like that but this movie and it's story of courage, the will to survive, blah blah blah, moved me so much than any other movie.  I am planning to purchase this now.

4810303,2,B005LAIII0,"The evaluation and following review is about the 3D Blu Ray release, not the film itself, which is excellent.  Though the 3D of the disc is very nice, it bothers me to no end that the film was cropped from 2.35:1 to 16x9 for this disc release.  This is a nasty habit from the days of 4x3 VHS and it seems to become common with 3D releases  again.  Cameron did the same to Avatar and Titanic, taking away the grandeur from both films along the way.  Stranger yet in Life of Pi Fox opted to curtain the Imax shot on the Blu Ray to make sure audiences would see the full shot, yet with the exception of a single scene the sides of the rest of the film are chopped off.  So this is for the people responsible:  If you have the balls to charge $30 for a disc, you better release the movie with it's complete picture on the 3D version, especially since you feel the need to release multiple versions packaged into one release anyway!  From this point on any 3D Blu Ray I encounter with it's aspect ratio mutilated will go straight back to the vendor.  I encourage everyone else to do the same, in an attempt to stop this!",1364256000,2,1115,4.197183098591549

The acting was absolutely fantastic, the special effects were amazing, the directing was perfect, the editing made everything flow so well... I could go on and on, but you really should see it for yourself! I still suggest that you read the book (if you haven't already!), but this is such a great movie that I won't hold it against you if you don't.

4810493,5,B005LAIII0,"I loved this story because it drew me in by first introducing the adult Pi and then allowing me to identify with the child Pi, his curiosity, his need to believe in God, then showed the strength of his human spirit when faced with an impossible situation.  Made me watch, just to see what happened, how he survives physically, emotionally and spiritually.  Great story!!",1364169600,,370,4.765625

Of course, sharing a boat with a Bengal Tiger is pure theatre (you wouldn't last a millisecond).  The movie was technically a winner.  I did not find any fault with the action scenes.  You really thought Richard Parker was only a few feet away.  Also, I liked that Ang Li did not go after any excessive bloody scenes that you would see in other productions.  I recommend this film to anyone old enough to understand.  Finally, I'm considering reading the book.  I would say this is very high praise.",1364169600,,655,4.483050847457627

The story starts actually from the family decision of selling the animals and ends when Pi lands.",1364169600,,404,4.472972972972973

However, at times the video would continue without an audio track. At other times the audio would slow down to being only noise while the video continued at the regular speed. Through the middle of the movie the audio ran in sync with the video for several minutes but then the audio would slow down. On numerous times, I would stop the movie, then resume and the audio would be in sync for about 1 to 2 minutes, then slow down. Twice the movie stopped to continue loading. With all the stops and starts, I barely finished the movie before time expired. I still didn't get to watch and listen to all the movie and understand all that happened. I have watched other movies from Amazon without ever having this problem.

This is just a gorgeous movie and can be enjoyed on countless levels.",1364083200,,378,4.611940298507463
4810952,3,B005LAIII0,"I watched LOP two weeks ago; so I've had a chance to think about how I felt about the movie.

I normally choose to watch only those movies that are given high marks, so as to not waste time. It didn't matter to me that this movie was nominated for an academy award for best picture. I found myself having low expectations. I find that whenever I have low expectations for a movie, the movie surprises me and I enjoy it. Somehow, this felt different.

I think it's because LOP is easily was one of the best books I've ever read.

Maybe it's because the movie didn't have any mystery? Granted, I knew what to expect from the plot, but I'm the type of guy who eats the same food over and over, and re-reads books and re-watches movies, so mystery isn't necessarily why I do anything.

I preferred the version of the story in the book.  There are some noticeable differences. Studying theology, the reporter is a female, Pi's marriage, etc.

It felt like... the movie's version of the story was told in a rushed way. IMO, best lines of the movie were taken directly from the book. So, The movie didn't suspend disbelief the way the book did. Examples: this should come as no surprise, but the book goes into far more detail about the 'taming' of RP; the floating island was move alive and even more of a curiosity in the book than the treatment it had in the movie; etc. Those details were lost and neglected in the translation.

BL: I'll read the book again for pleasure, but you couldn't pay me to watch the movie again, it's not worth the time.",1364083200,,1543,4.374125874125874
4810953,3,B005LAIII0,"The CG Tiger was beautiful but the whale was so obviously fake among other things.  And the movie was unrealistic it is more like a story of legend than reality.  Also, I searched online an the longest time I found of someone being lost at sea was 22-year-old Poon Lim's 133 days alone.  When I watch these types of films I often think about what it would be like to really be stuck in that situation but the movies was so unrealistic that it was almost a dream world than reality and nothing like what it would really be like.  Also, I wonder what people in India think of this film.",1364083200,,584,4.2342342342342345

That's not an exaggeration.  One.  Hour.  And nothing happens.  In fact, little happens in the movie from beginning to end.  Avoid at all costs.",1364083200,,316,4.5
4810956,5,B005LAIII0,"The Life of Pi is a fable-like story that has been brought to the screen by an astounding director. The visuals of this film were worth the purchase price. The story requires the ability to suspend belief and let the viewer's mind open itself to the experience in order to enjoy the film and receive the full impact. If you are a person who views a film with the sole purpose of picking it apart, you'll be disappointed because you missed the story.

I recommend this film for all ages.",1364083200,3,486,4.4

4811019,3,B005LAIII0,"This is a nice flick.  To me, the symbolism was overdone.  The ending left me a bit cold.  Visually, very beautiful, but all animation.  So why it was nominated and won at the Oscars is a little baffling.  The subject of the animation was amazing and portrayed very sweetly.  The story was OK.  The writing was OK.  I guess perhaps I had higher expectations as an Oscar nominee than I felt it delivered.  I'm not sure, with all the superb animation and computer graphics that exist in the world these days, why this movie was so chatted-up.  I found it to be a faux-myth without much substance at all.  With all that said, it's worth the rental fee, perhaps a good purchase.  If you want to know 'everything' that can be done on a computer, then it's worth it as well.

I found that I thought about the film all day the following day, and my husband said he did, too, and he's upgraded his rating to ""I really liked it"", and I have upgraded mine to ""magnificent"".

4811318,4,B005LAIII0,When I first heard the plot of this movie I thought how can you sustain a guy in a boat with a lion. Ang Lee pulls it off. The cinematography and blending of cgi is nothing like I've ever seen. Inspirational as well. You wouldn't waste your time watching this movie Richard Parker.,1364083200,,281,4.320754716981132

4811326,4,B005LAIII0,"Though I personally loved this film I can see why some shy away. The movie does move slow in the beginning yes,but to me this movie is truly like a roller coaster in that you're going up this huge hill very slowly,but when you reach the peak and then plummet,your heart is in your throat the whole time.
Life of Pi is truly one of those films that has it all. Heavy emotional drama,comedy, suspense,you name it you'll find a little bit of it in this film and its all done almost flawlessly.
The character of Richard Parker is one of the best I think I've personally ever seen but what makes the Tiger companion so great isn't anything he does through the film but Pi's attachment to the animal.

The 3D in this film is exceptional. I won't spoil anything,but the scene with the flying fish is probably the greatest 3D moment in any film to date. So if your a 3D buff,this movie is worth it for that one scene alone.

I give the 3D 5 stars and the film itself 4.",1364083200,,961,4.217391304347826

LOVE IT!!!! And so it DOES go with God,1364083200,,356,4.650793650793651

I must admit that I am not at all familiar with the book, so I bring no book-laden expectations to the film. I saw this film strictly on the basis of a few trailers I saw that intrigued me. I love the visual splendor of the tiger, and the menace of the tiger at close quarters was absolutely terrifying. The great cosmic meaning of the film may have escaped me, but I  was transfixed at the sight of this beautiful and deadly beast and the young man playing a cat and mouse game with him in the lifeboat. I was well entertained, and am not worried if I should have had a profound insight and did not. The film is like a moving breathing work of art, and it captured my attention for every minute of it's length, which is something that I can't say about many films these days.

Gorgeous film; loved the CGI animation.  Fascinated by the tiger-in-your-lifeboat problem, keeping him fed without becoming food.  But it was all undermined by the denouement at the end.

I also really liked the 3D cinematography giving this film its stunning effects and showing nature in its beauty as well as fury. Also, the ending has a ""food for thought"" twist.

It is a great story, compelling and powerful: part survival story, part fantasy, part animal psychology...and all in glorious 3D visual artistry. It is also the story of faith; although the protagonist, Pi Patel's approach to God is an ambiguous one, in that he espouses the Hindu, Christian and Islamic faiths. At one point his father says, ""following multiple faiths is no faith at all!""; and I would agree, but somehow Pi's simplicity of faith is believable. While the lion's (or Tiger's) share for the excellence of this film - my opinion - should go to Ang Lee, the performance by 17 year old Suraj Sharma, in his film debut, as Pi Patel, should not be overlooked. It is in many ways a masterful performance, not often attained by experienced actors twice or three times his age. The CGI/special effects, which like the cast, is international in scope, is also a wonder to behold...even if you do not care for the story, the visuals make the movie worth watching.

4811691,5,B005LAIII0,"Ang Lee is pretty damn amazing. Here is a Chinese filmaker with an ouvre that includes such varied work as Brokeback Mountain, Hulk, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Eat Drink, Man Woman, Lust, Caution, and now Life of Pi (all except for Hulk pretty brilliant). That one man can capture both the unique Chinese flavor of Crouching Tiger and the Western American rhythm of Brokeback. Amazing.

Now we have this film, which resists all categorization. At one level, it's an eminently watchable survival adventure and pure visual treat. I haven't read the book yet (I will now), but I have to asume it has a fable-like quality, and so does the film. The color alone is surreal and intense. The cinematography is gorgeous. Some of the shots... woah. There is some odd unreal nighttime lighting here too -- although it works. There is very heavy use of shallow depth of field to good effect.

It's worth noting that I saw the film in 3D, which has clearly graduated from three years ago when it was only for the likes of Alice in Wonderland (hiss) and How to Train Your Dragon. Now we have it in high budget literary adventure religious allegory. Interestingly, I'm pretty convinced that 3D has the effect of decreasing realism. It makes everything look like CGI, heightened, super-real, like an HDR photograph.

The acting is also superb. The casting of Pi at various ages is dead on. All three are highly emotive. And the tiger -- who is presumably 90% CGI -- he's the stuff of legend. There is one damn cool animal. The soggy cat hanging off the side of the boat is just so sad, lest us forget that the Bengal Tiger is the world's most dangerous land animal. Tiger's are fast, deadly, climb, swim, and can bat your head off with one paw. Imagine sharing a lifeboat with one! There's a 19th century tiger known to have killed over 430 men.

The film is to beautiful, that the ocean itself, and its bevy of sea life, becomes a character. As desperate as Pi (and Richard Parker the Tiger) are, they can't help but marvel at the little seen wonders that present, and us with them.

Thematically, I'm not yet sure how to digest Life of Pi. It's a pretty deeply emotional movie, and at some level plays to the film medium's visual strengths. The picture hints at deeper philosophical notes, but doesn't really illuminate. I sense extreme abbreviation. After all, 450 pages of novel would result in perhaps six hours of film.

Boy, was I wrong.  This turned out to be such a wonderful film with such an inspiring story, it moved me to tears.

But the movie (and the story) isn't perfect.  One thing I didn't quite appreciate was Pi's pronouncement for ""God""--although I can see how odd it would've been for him to call out ""33 million Hindu gods"" or ""Allah.""  As a atheist, I didn't quite care for the religious value of the story.

Many human characters are attractive in different ways, though the writer is only a foil, not even as developed as the interviewer in ""Interview with the Vampire.""  The central character, Pi, is so engrossing and the development of his life is so captivating that only his immediate family are relevant in the film.  Some animals are significant, but the Bengal Tiger embodies powerful forces of Nature with which we are obliged to become aware and learn to live with.  The trials that Pi has to go through speak to the common challenges of the human condition, but are exaggerated in ways that, thankfully, most of us don't have to experience.  They are illustrative of the human search for meaning and purpose, and for ethical and moral ways of being in the world.

4811938,5,B005LAIII0,Awesome Epic Journey into Spirituality and Academy Award Recommended. I was astounded and impressed by Director Ang Lee and his Actor Suraj Sharma and entire Academy Award winning crew on the power of prayer. I was astounded How Epicly Amazing it truly was a heart moving expeirnece and forwardwith the human spirit to survive with spritual reasoning.,1363737600,,351,5.175438596491228
4811939,2,B005LAIII0,"As the title of this review states, I had no idea what ""Life of Pi"" was about.  I went in totally blind, thinking it was a simple adventure story.  What I found was visually pleasing and spiritually empty.  Mind you, I had no idea there was supposed to be any spiritual element to this film but when I was fully informed of the spiritual message (mostly at the very end of the film) I found that it strongly detracted from an otherwise great story.  In fact, had there been no spiritual message at all and simply a film about how some cope with traumatic events, OR had it been a chronicling of Pi's spiritual pursuits I might have enjoyed it much more.  It is neither but tries to be both.
I read some of the other reviews and many people comment that this movie is about a spiritual journey.  In reality there is no spiritual journey to speak of after the introduction of young Pi and his fascination with several prominent religions.  The rest of the story is nothing more than a fantasy concocted by Pi in order to cope with a very ugly and traumatic experience.  There is no spiritual journey contained in that entire section of the movie, just the stressed and desperate musings of a boy struggling to stay alive and sane on the open ocean.  Somehow, the very personal emotional significance of this experience is seen as valid ground to make a universal spiritual statement about God.  It doesn't require much thought to understand the folly of taking such a ridiculous liberty.  Therein the true intentions of the writer are revealed and the full weight of the emptiness of this film hits you like bad breath, momentarily offensive but of no real import.  Were it not for the movie's amazing visuals and the excellent acting of Suraj Sharma (a complete amateur no less!) I would have given it one star, as it is, it remains well directed and acted but poorly conceived.",1363737600,,1877,4.553571428571429

An incredible visual experience (and a magical combination of characters) on screen to be sure, but the depth of allegory that this parable manages to express and finally reveal at the end into a literal concrete ""meaning"" is utterly poignant and only the most clueless (or darkened) soul of a person can hope to reject the value in the message being expressed here.  This isn't a preachy film at all, and its appeal is that is reaches out and touches everyone capable of being an audience to it. How important is it to understand the many ways in which a truth can be expressed? How important and vital to our understanding and growth to not dogmatize or demonize a contrary method to that truth if there be one?

I can't say any more for fear of spoiling it to the unaware concerning the details of the story (so watch it!!) - But suffice it to say that this film was one of those ""OH S*** that's amazing"" moments for me, at the level of experience all too rare in its potency in this industry, and one that I'm thankful to have experienced.

4812485,5,B005LAIII0,"The 411 by Maria:

In it's most basic form the movie is about Pi Patel, the only human survivor after his parents commission a ship to move their zoo from India to Canada. Along with Pi is an orangutan, a hyena, a zebra that broke it's leg when it feel into the life boat and an adult Bengal Tiger (who is named Richard Parker).

After the other animals are killed by tiger, Pi and the Tiger learn to coexist on and off the life boat until Pi is rescued in Mexico 227 days after the ship went down.

OK...now that I gave you that very brief summary, let's get into how and why I liked it so much. The movie is exquisitely done with amazing cinematography and CGI effects. I truly love how beautiful it was and wish I had seen it in 3D!

Pi played by Suraj Sharma as the shipwrecked younger Pi and later Irrfan Khan as older Pi, is amazingly resourceful as he struggles to keep himself and Richard Parker alive.

My husband says it reminded him of Tom Hanks Castaway, I can see why he would say that but visually, it is way above Castaway.

From a viewer's point of view, despite its remarkable visual and narrative mastery, ""Pi"" felt like just another high-quality Hollywood production - one that makes you feel good but is easily forgettable - until the story took a suddenly turn toward the end and Pi confronted us with the brutal truth and challenged our faith in humanity with the ultimate question: ""which story do you prefer?"". Without the last 10 minutes ""Pi"" is a 3-star movie; with its last 10 minutes it easily claims 5. Thanks to his extraordinary cinematic talent, director Ang Lee was able to do justice to the story itself - that is no small feat.

""Pi"" is not a religious movie - not in the sense that it preaches anything. It simply asks us a question and leaves the rest to us. For some of us it's uplifting; for the rest of us it does nothing - until a later time.",1363651200,3,985,4.466666666666667

4812538,4,B005LAIII0,"It's a good picture, beautiful visuals and merits more than one viewing. The allegory, be it spiritual or illusory, felt a little underdeveloped, or perhaps it will make more sense to me later on. Being a sincere fan of Ang Lee's oeuvre, I was already inclined to favor this movie beforehand - and more so after it didn't turn stupid or fall apart in the third act, like too many epic films by big name directors. However, I still enjoyed those other movies, mostly.",1363651200,,466,4.559523809523809

This is a fantastic movie. The story telling, the visuals, the plot --- WOW! It should have gotten more awards. Just fantabulous! That will be in our movie cache for a lifetime. The visuals are just unbelievable! WOW!

1. Beautiful.
2. Tiger is amazing.
3. Everything that happens in the ocean.

The negatives:
1. Too much preaching about god and religion (I don't like buying propaganda without being warned first).
2. Story is weak.
3. Not much character development.
4. Not sure what the point of the movie was and I could have lived perfectly fine without ever watching it.

Don't know why some think this movie is a deep religious movie. This is as shallow and simplistic as a modern practitioner of Christianity. If the bible were made into a movie it would be the most x-rated, violent, incestual, racist, xenophobic, masochistic, chauvinist movie ever. This movie takes the idea of god and religion and turns it into a simple message of pretty covenient nothingness.",1363564800,4,851,4.821917808219178

The ending of the movie leaves you questioning and wondering what is real and what is not and if it really matters in the end.

4812863,5,B005LAIII0,"On one level this is a spectacularly filmed survival tale, but it is much more than that. It follows the book very closely. The attempt of the character as a boy to integrate all the religions of the world is put to another sort of test by the voyage--how to integrate the human and animal dimensions of himself, to see beyond his mother's and father's competing and contradictory visions of an irrational and deep world of spirit versus a rational world of learning skillful manipulation. The pacifist, vegetarian boy must move beyond those beliefs to find the ferocity of survival within himself, the intensity of the carnivorous Richard Parker--his traveling mate tiger, who brings him into a confrontation with the depths and expanse of a larger universe under the night sky and mirroring waves. What the rational and calculative world represented by the Japanese ship-owners can see in this tale is only one of human manipulation and competition, but what the man can see as  greater depths of this story and its reality is a cosmic coming together of dimensions that are archetypal and the expansion of spirit grounded in the earth and the animal. It is not an untroubled vision, where carnivorous islands of the soul float in the depth of the night to disturb us.",1363564800,4,1270,4.852534562211981

Yes, the beginning was rather slow but I found it to be a foundation for what was to come.  The visual effects are awesome and so realistic.

4813036,5,B005LAIII0,"Without the stunning visual images in the ""adrift at sea"" section of the movie, the viewer might despair of Pi's fate. Yet this movie is really about his journey in spirit. After having to leave India with his family, the boy becomes the lone human survivor after the cargo ship they were taking passage to North America is scuttled in a typhoon off the Philippines. In India they had been the operators of a small zoo. Some of their animals made the trip and 3 in particular survived the initial shipwreck. Some of the spiritual dynamics introduced including Krishna are brought out as Pi learns to deal with his ferocious companion, a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker and as the days lengthen to months at sea with little hope of survival we see how he envisions the world of the sea in fantastic luminous images. He first lands on a strange island which is hospitable by day and hostile by night by virtue of pure waters turning acidic by night. Later he washes up in Mexico where his longtime companion tiger just calmly walks into the forest without a look back. This upsets him and then a strange twist occurs when he is asked by Japanese authorities to account for his being the only survivor of the wrecking of their cargo ship. His story is too fantastic for them so he tells them another one which is more sinister yet more plausible. The allegory is caught by his listener as he retells the story many years later. The spiritual lesson is what do you wish to believe, the boy floating across the Pacific with a tiger or a boy who escaped evil doers.",1363478400,,1561,4.519434628975265

4813040,3,B005LAIII0,"It is true this movie is a work of art.  The visuals are stunning and beautiful.  I understood the movie and enjoyed it.  I purchased the movie as a possible book and film study for my high school seniors.  Not sure they will make it through the movie without falling asleep as there are many slow sections.  That being said, many of the slow parts are complemented with thought-provoking scenary and action.  That is part of the beauty and mystery of the movie.  I do not understand the many reviews saying this was a horror movie.  Horror, in film, is a lot different than a horrific life experience.  It is not a ""horror movie"".  As for the animals...one of the themes of the film is survival and also living on the planet with other species which God has created (all unique in their own way).  Animals eat one another in the wild and we eat animals too.  My domestic cats sitting here on the table beside me just ate their tuna and Fancy Feast, which, I believe still has meat in it.  If you watched this with your children and they cried all the way through...I don't believe you.  None of the scenes with animals eating one another were even slightly gruesome.  There was not any blood or carnage.  Reviewers, please know what you are talking about before you review...and focus on the story.

I rented this movie in HD because the visuals looked amazing in the preview.  This was the first movie I had rented in HD from Amazon.  I normally watch 1080 movies on Vudu and they run just fine.  The video quality started out great for the first 20 minuets, but after that it went down hill quickly.

Multiple times throughout the movie the quality shot way down.  Amazons video quality indicator on screen would show low bandwidth so I would run a speed test at that time to determine if my provider was to blame.  I would get 40mbs down and 5mbs up while the video quality would remain very poor.  My TV was hard wired and not streaming over wireless.

The story is amazingly engaging, so much so that I couldn't believe the end was upon me so soon by the conclusion.  This is a testament to the original author but also the adaptation.  As I mentioned the directing and visuals were pure eye candy, yet so tastefully and expertly done that they serve to pull you into the story rather than distract you from it.  Toss in some deep revelations that will leave you in self reflection long after the credits role and you have a modern day masterpiece that is very hard to come by these ADD days and harder to just walk away from when the screen finally goes black.

This movie is pretty unique but just to compare the ""feel"" of it to some others you may have seen to give a general idea of whether it will fit your viewing mood at the moment: take 3 parts Cast Away, mix with 1 part Big Fish, add a dash of We Bought a Zoo and just a pinch of Hugo and mix thoroughly on the high seas.",1363478400,,1098,4.180094786729858

Why?
Because almost everything I've read has been positive and yet every review has had a much different take on the overall meaning of the film.
I was expecting a spiritual rebirth for myself somewhat.
Unrealistic yes, but that is the kind of praise that's been heaped on this film.
I was expecting a movie that was life changing.
Well...it wasn't.
I didn't get either of those things and yet I don't feel cheated either.
And that is the real magic of this film...that everyone will take away something different.
Me?
I took away a real sense of sorrow and yet I took away an almost calm feeling. I type this with a somewhat mischievous grin on my face because that is another strange feeling that this film gave me.
This isn't just a film about a boy lost at sea.
It's a film about feelings and how we react to certain situations.
It is a film I will revisit many times over the years
It is...a difficult but successful movie that will make you ponder the meaning of many things.
Brilliant direction.
Score, FX, 3D...pretty much everything is absolute perfection.
Watch it just once with an open mind.
Some will love it, some will hate it, some will never understand it and most of us will take away something different from it than anyone else.

Very difficult but very rewarding.

4813312,4,B005LAIII0,"Life of Pi(released Sept/12)stars,among others,Suraj Sharma as Pi,age 16,Irrfan Khan as Pi,adult,Tabu as Gita Patel,Pi's mother,Adil Hussain as Santosh Patel,Pi's father and Grard Depardieu as the Cook. This is a stunningly visual treat which keeps you mesmerized through a good part of the film. The animals that one sees through a good part of the film,are mostly CGI creations. And it is not hard to tell that they are just that,but the film doesn't linger too long on them as to undo your suspension of disbelief altogether. Lee just keeps pushing the story along.
And that story opens as a reporter in Montreal is interviewing an Indian man who starts to relate a rather bizarre tale;one that will have you ""believing in God"".The man relates as to how he got his name of Pi,as in the mathematical symbol. It seems an uncle liked a swimming area in Paris called the Piscine Molitor,and he became Pi for short. One day the father sees the writing on the wall and he decides to move his family to Canada;Winnipeg specifically. The father and the family run a zoo. They sell what animals they can and take the rest.
Part way through the voyage,just past Indonesia,a fierce storm comes up and the ship sinks,taking with it Pi's entire family. In a lifeboat hanging from the davit,there is the ships cook,into which is thrown Pi. Suddenly a Zebra loose from below decks,jumps from a storey up and onto the boat,breaking both its legs and sending the cook overboard and the boat into the water. Pi ends up in the water more than once but witnesses from under it the ships last breath as it sinks beneath the waves like a surreal lighted leviathan. Pi makes it back into the boat. Next morning things start to move. A hyena suddenly appears from under the boat awning cover and starts to harass Pi and the Zebra. Suddenly an orangutang joins this motley crew. It isn't long before the hyena gets its sea legs and it starts to attack and kills the zebra. Time passes and it goes after and kills the orangutang. Just as it is about to attack Pi a tiger comes out from under the awning and kills the hyena. From this moment on Pi must learn not only to survive but survive without getting eaten by the tiger.
For the first part of their journey Pi builds himself a makeshift raft on which to live,keeping a rope attached from the boat to his raft. Eventually,after many travails,and at the end of his rope,Pi comes on board and teaches the tiger how to behave when told. It surprisingly works and the two get on relatively well. They come upon a floating island whose inhabitants are mostly meerkats. It has fresh water ponds in which to drink and the tiger has plenty of food(meerkats).As Pi lay asleep in the night the meerkats take to the tress and the tiger goes back to the boat. The why becomes plainly clear when at night the ponds become acidic and kill everything that are in or may fall into them. Pi and the tiger leave the island the next day. They eventually wash up on shore in Mexico and are rescued.
Shortly thereafter reps from the Japanese shipping company come a calling to Pi asking questions about the reasons behind the sinking and his story of survival. Pi relates the tiger story to them and when they ask for the truth he relates another story of he being stranded with his mother,a sailor and the cook. The sailor was injured and the cook killed the sailor. When a struggle occurs later his mother pushes Pi to safety as she gets stabbed to death. Pi later returns and kills the cook and drifts alone at sea until he reaches Mexico. In the present the reporter looks at the actual shipping report and it seems the reps chose the tiger story over the other. When asked by a now grown up Pi which one he preferred,he replies the tiger story also. The film ends as Pi introduces the reporter to his two children and his wife.
After all we have seen and experienced Lee decides to give us a nice twist of an ending. Which story would we have preferred to see?.....the tiger story of course,and that is what we got. As the film begins one wonders where it is going as it visually describes Pi's childhood,which has its funny and serious moments. But the movie really starts to take off at about 30 minutes into the film when the ship begins to founder and sinks. One really feels like you are right there with Pi as he experiences the monumental loss of not only his family,but his way of life,all his belongings and the ship that would take him to a new life. With just his wits,some common sense,the teachings of his family and his religious beliefs,he must somehow survive and endure an indescribably tough,but at the same time,beautifully rich life trial. Along the way we are treated to a myriad of visually stunning moments such as the appearance of bio luminescent fish and a whale who breaches as it comes up to feed on same,the meerkats on the island,the sinking of the ship and so many more. And,if you haven't guessed,they are just that much more stunning because it may not have been real to begin with....right?
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1. There is an""extra""category on this DVD but all it contains are trailers. Kind of a false advert if you ask me.
All in all a treat for the visual senses. A simple story told with a straightforward touch but with a heck of a twist ending. The CGI animals are good but not fool proof,and Ang Lee steers his film with a deft touch never lingering too long on any one thing. It was nominated for 11 statues and won four. Well deserved. 4 1/2 stars. Excellent but not perfect.",1363305600,3,5569,4.520317145688801

4813391,5,B005LAIII0,"The Short: A visual marvel. A human triumph. A test of faith. Finding God. An incredible story. Life of Pi is this and many other things, sweeping the viewer away into a mesmerizing place that blurs the lines between dream and what is real.

Ang Lee directs the previously thought un-filmable book to the big screen, Life of Pi. How it comes to life is breathtaking; an ingeniously woven tapestry of incredible visual elements and powerfully adept storytelling, all to the affect of discovering the greater meaning of being alive in a situation you would rather die in.

It's an art movie that many audiences will love simply because of the gorgeous visuals, memorable character(s), and incredible spectacle. But for those looking for a deeper, meaty, and memorable movie going experience Life of Pi has you covered. No other movie nominated for best picture at the 2013 Oscars has perplexed me, moved me, made me reflect and think, and swept me away within its lush, visual imagery and unique storytelling. It's a film chock full of metaphor, visual imagery, and raw emotion. But this isn't a discussion of the film's many layers of religious undertones and imagery, but a review. I'll keep it that way!

First off is director Ang Lee's incredible talent on display (for which he won Best Director - 2013). I have yet to read Life of Pi but from what I've heard from friends and book junkies is that Life of Pi is an incredibly complex, almost muddy in direction, novel which many considered un-filmable. What becomes of this epic tale of survival is a clean and expertly directed film, with all of its themes and underlying tones hidden within the visual landscape and story. It's not a force-fed experience, but rather one where you must process the vast array of information and make your own judgment on some of its less touched-on ideas. Whatever creative process Mr. Lee went through to bring this incredibly complex adventure to life is beyond me, and that's a true testament of the genius on display.

You can't talk about Life of Pi without discussing the incredible visuals. Winning both Best Cinematography (2013) and Best Special Effects (2013) at the 2013 Academy Awards, I had high expectations going into Life of Pi. The film starts off, simply put, like any other PG-rated family film. I was nervous that it was going to be a bust. Where the film takes the viewer is someplace completely unique and unexpected. Without spoiling some of the finer moments, Life of Pi has visual panache to spare. There are some incredible moments that are rendered and recreated with such life-like detail that getting lost in Pi's tale is tremendously easy. Its visuals dazzle, but don't distract its storytelling, unlike other films (namely Avatar, which is a visual marvel but hardly a groundbreaking example of storytelling). One of the main strengths in Life of Pi is Richard Parker, the Bengal tiger that accompanies Pi during his quest. Little did I know that that 90 percent of his screen-time is completely computer animated. And it's not just that, but the rest of the film; the water effects, the tumbling ship, various animals; all of it is incredible. It maintains a perfect balance of realism and a dream-like quality. Some of the scenes are also shot with incredible vision and beauty. It's simply the most beautiful cinematography of any film last year (other than the Hobbit). I have nothing but praise for Life of Pi's cinematographer and special effects team.

But no story is worth being told without great characters and actors to tell them. Life of Pi's Suraj Sharma (Pi) is absolutely fantastic. Emotional, powerful, and sincere; he is one seriously talented actor for never having been in a role before...ever. While the beginning of the film features a quick romance between Pi and Gita, featuring its fair share of awkward exchanges, its nothing annoying. Pi and his incredible story is what you see 90 percent of the time. It's his story of finding faith in the darkest of times, discovering courage where none should be present, and having the will to continue to live. The rest of the supporting cast does just fine in their various roles, aiding along the telling of a most grandiose adventure.

Everything else is spectacular as well. The original score (also winning the Oscar for Best Score - 2013) fits the pages of Pi's story like clockwork. From the moving ""Pi's Lullaby"" to the gorgeous and ethereal ""First Night, First Day"", the original score never distracts but rather augments the experience, creating some of the most beautiful audio-visual-scapes in any film from recent memory. Sound editing is particularly fantastic. Crashing waves, minute sound effects; it's all done particularly well, especially in its transition to home video (aside from a couple of weird boom adjustments made mid scene that distract the acute ear). And boy, I can only imagine the splendor of the 3D this film had to offer but I, regretfully, was not able to see it in theaters, only on Blu-Ray. The one issue I had with the visual presentation was this, also noticed by Blu-Ray.com: ""There are two spots in the film where the aspect ratio changes suddenly from the normal 1.85:1. During the ""flying fish"" sequence that was used as a teaser for the movie, the top and bottom close in to 2.35:1, and there's a single overhead shot of a whale passing beneath the lifeboat that inexplicably squeezes in to a window-boxed 1.33:1. I'm not sure what the rationale or workflow was here, so I can't really comment on it, but don't be alarmed by the out-of-nowhere framing changes."" In layman's terms, the film goes from a whole-screen experience to having the black bars on the top and bottom and sides during two scenes, which is fairly distracting.

Where Pi finishes his journey is up to you to discover and interpret. Where it stands for me, personally, is my favorite film of 2012. Visually spectacular, incredibly engaging, intricately told, and masterfully directed, Life of Pi was a massive gamble that pays off in more ways than one. It's an absolute classic.

4813477,3,B005LAIII0,"This story had all the makings of something great... and it was expertly destroyed.

The entire aspect of this being a story told with religious intents should have been removed. The religious messages in the actual story told by Pi are perfectly fine, but the messages the movie itself tries to send with the building and falling action doomed the movie to mediocrity.

If you remove the first and last ten minutes or so of the movie, it would have been absolutely epic.

The visual effects, the emotional turmoil, the life-in-the-balance struggles, the twists, all were superb... if only it didn't begin and end with whispers and whimpers... You could remove the intro and ending add just a minute to the story and make this an epic tale of survival in the most incredible of circumstances, albeit with a rather fantastically mystical ambiance at times, but the attempts to weakly convey a religious message ruined the entire drama.

More telling, perhaps, is that it even failed on delivering on its own religious message. Not so much as causing one to think for a second as to its initial claims... except to wonder when the big moment was to come, only to be greeted with the closing credits.",1363219200,3,1197,4.768115942028985

From the standpoint of direction, with one small exception, it is flawless.  That flaw is the scene in the family's cabin while the ship is in very heavy seas.  Pi is leaning over the side of his bunk, arm hanging down, but there is no suggestion of motion.  What I can't decide is if this was intentionally done to make the severity of the storm a form of shock and awe, or simply, an omission.

The acting, especially all the age variations of Pi, was spot on.  everyone performed well.

The CGI in this film was outstanding.  You would be hard pressed to tell that wasn't a real tiger.  The 3-D was good throughout, with no obvious attempts to get oohs and ahs.

However, not much else happens for most of the movie, some high frightening waves and spray and then back to the boy and the tiger doing the same thing for an hour or so.  I won't put spoilers in here.  However there is a second story and it is confusing and hard to follow and at that point after two hours, I turned the movie off.

4813521,3,B005LAIII0,"I've given myself a few months to digest this film, since I feel as though my initial response to it may have been jilted thanks to my unapologetic adoration of the novel.  Jilted in a bad way, since I felt this paled in comparison and so I was almost angry at the film for being critically successful.  Taking these few months to let it all marinade, I have to admit that not a whole lot has changed from my initial feelings.

While reading `Life of Pi', on a plane coming home from Europe, I was spellbound.  Page after page kept me intrigued and absorbed and engaged and completely in awe of everything being expressed and expounded on.  The journey and magical quality of it all was one thing, but the spiritual undertones and the way it beautifully developed the themes of faith and God were so articulate yet never condescending or overbearing that it all felt so effortless.  Up until that point, I had no real interest in the film adaptation that was fast approaching, but after putting the book down I was overcome with this intense desire to see Lee's film.  When I saw that it was a PG rated film, obviously directed at families, I was a bit hesitant.  It's not that the novel was extremely graphic, and yet in parts it really was and I just couldn't understand how you could try and make this a family film.

Still, I had to see it.

For those unfamiliar with the story, the basic premise is this.  A young boy named Pi (pronounced Pee) grows up in India on a zoo with his family.  At a young age he becomes fascinated with the idea of God and faith and religion and begins to study and practice multiple religions in an attempt to bring himself closer to God.  When his family decides to sell the zoo and move to Canada, Pi finds himself on a boat with a crew that dislikes him and a slew of animals in cages awaiting their destiny overseas.  During a terrible and unexpected storm everything goes awry, Pi's family is killed and he is left destitute on a life boat with a hyena, zebra, orangutan and Richard Parker, a Bengal tiger.  For 227 days, Pi has to learn to survive alongside this beast.

It is an intriguing tale and one that it mostly approached from an angle of respect, and I must admit that the way Lee visually crafts the film is marvelous, but outside of those visuals I found the film to be almost shallow in its presentation of the more intimate and important themes of the story.  The core of the story is lost in a film that becomes redundant and superficial.  I think a big problem with the `translation' of the film is that the key segments on the book are all internalized.  You read the thought patterns of young Pi and you begin to become entranced in his world.  In film it isn't always easy to convey internalized transformations and so the outward redundancies (yelling at the tiger, starving, fishing, yelling at the tiger) carry less weight.  While there is tragedy at the center of the film, it became almost too focused on the visuals and so it lost the heaviness needed to carry the emotional side of the story.  It became pretty, but empty.  I also found the changes to the story to be unnecessary.  Pi's love interest was a ridiculous inclusion, especially since there is no development of that story and so their separation carries no weight.  I also found the whale scene to be kind of pointless, yet pretty, and while I understand the idea of creating tension thanks to the aftermath of the scene it just didn't do what it set out to do.

The way the film is spliced is also somewhat irritating, although I'm sure it was developed to try and add some interruption to the redundancy of Pi's struggle.  The constant shifting from present to past and the use of Irrfan Khan (elder Pi) as a narrator for many of Pi's actions felt forced and took me out of the story, to be honest.  It also took some of the key moments in the book (like the adventure on Meerkat Island) and condensed them to the point where they were almost pointless.  I understand the need of narration to explain certain things that visuals won't readily explain, but these segments were so short that they almost trivialized their inclusion.

I'll admit, the conclusion is still heartbreaking, and when the big question is asked, ""Which story do you prefer?"", I can't help but feel the lump in my throat.  I also can't help  but reply, ""I prefer the story Yann Martel told me!"".

Still, `Life of Pi' is a beautiful film.  The visual effects are some of the best I've ever seen in a film, and for that it richly deserved its Oscar.  I take issue with the cinematography Oscar, since the skies and sea were all created by the visual effects department, but whatever.  This was purely a director's film in the end, and so for that I guess Lee's Oscar shouldn't be all that shocking to me, although I really don't think he deserved it.  He may have created a visually arresting film, but the core of this film was not a visual one but an emotional and spiritual one and he failed to tie those ends together (for me).

The acting of Infan Khan was wonderful, and he truly embodies his character and allows you to see not only the joy that he has in his life but also the pain, guilt and sadness that has come with it too.

4813553,4,B005LAIII0,"As is obvious from the number of rave reviews this film LIFE OF PI was are sounding success in the theaters when it was shown in 3D. There is no question but that the story, so well known over the past decades since the publication of the book of the same name by Yann Martel, draws everybody in, whether because of the indomitable spirit of our surviving hero or the religious aspects of the story.  Perhaps because of all the hoopla about director Ang Lee's manipulation of CGI effects and the endless interviews about the making of the film that make the final product (on DVD at least) seem so contrived and unreal that some viewers will find the end product less than satisfying a version of the novel. David Magee sculpted the screenplay from the novel and while that provides a lot of background about the character of Pi before the main event of the lost at see episode, it does seem disruptive at times and in this viewer's response robs the story form some of the poetry.

The story has been summarized elsewhere as follows: `In Canada, a writer visits the Indian storyteller Pi Patel and asks him to tell a story. Pi tells the story of his life since he was a kid in Pondicherry, India and the origin of his nickname. One day, his father who owns a zoo tells his family that his business is not good and he had decided to move to Canada and sell part of the animals in the United States. They travel in a Japanese cargo ship with the animals and out of the blue, there is a storm followed by a shipwrecking. Pi survives in a lifeboat with a zebra, a orangutan, a hyena and a male Bengal tiger called Richard Parker. They are adrift in the Pacific Ocean and when the tiger is hungry, he eats the other animals. Soon Pi learns that he might find a way to feed and domesticate the tiger to survive.

The character of Pi Patel is played for the most part by Suraj Sharma while his earlier years embodiments are shared by Ayush Tandon and Gautam Belur and the adult storyteller by Irrfan Khan. Pi's parents are played by Adil Hussain  and Gita Patel and his brother Ravi by, depending on age, Ayan Khan, Mohd Abbas Khaleeli, and Vibish Sivakumar,  Rafe Spall is the writer who will create the book from Pi's story, and for a few brief moments Grard Depardieu plays a Cook on the ship.

There are some very beautiful scenes of skies and waterscapes, but we are left wondering how much of this is carton created in the large studio tank that serves as the ocean. Some of Martell's original explanation of the various religions Pi adheres to are retained: they were the best part of the novel. Perhaps in 3D this film would have worked better.

4813654,3,B005LAIII0,"...fable I would say.  I looked forward to seeing this film after all the hype (to say nothing of the Academy Awards), so it was inevitable, I suppose, that I was disappointed.

The tension between the rational and the ineffable -- science and religion, reason vs. faith, has always been my favorite literary device.  Think ""Inherit The Wind"", Spencer Tracy version.  The only new insight here is the line ""Someone else introduces us to God when we are young"" (I paraphrase).  I let that sink in.  True enough.

This movie reminded me in some ways of ""Cast Away"" -- ship/plane-wrecked at sea and lost on a deserted island.  One man has a Bengal tiger, the other a Wilson soccer ball.  Of the two films, ""Cast Away"" works more cogently for me at illuminating the human condition.  Faith or Fact?  The fork in the road -- the crossroad at the end of ""Cast Away"", and all the choices which preceeded it.  I'm not being dragged into a discussion of whether or not I ""believe in God"", or ""which story I believe"".  Better the mirror held up to see the reflection of a lifetime of choices.

The atheist and the person of faith share the same conundrum: neither can speak rationally about the unknowable or metaphysical.  And since no one really knows, we all must wait until our fate meets us.  And therein liveth the fable.

ADDENDUM:  I watched this movie a second time in order that I might better connect with the dialogue and narration.  I understand the question (is there a God?), but not the conclusion here: God is in the story.  Life is full of sorrow (polio, shipwrecks, evil people -- which includes the hero here, as he admits in his second version of the story), but also of beauty and joy.  But what we experience as ""real"" depends on how we tell the story?  And that's where we find God?  Too thin for me.  I do appreciate the author and director for tackling this question, however.  That alone makes this a better-than-average film.

ADDENDUM #2:  I bought the 3D BluRay, and I must disagree with the people who say the 3D effects are lacking.  This is the best 3D movie I have purchased yet, including ""Avatar"", ""Hugo"", ""Bolt"", and ""John Carter"".  The 3D effects are very good on my Sony 3D BD player and 65"" Vizio 3D HDTV.

Then was followed by a hummingbird that was supposed to be in true 3D fluttering around in front of the screen. The 3D was second rate. The action sequences on almost every occasion were not in 3D when it was crucial they be in 3D. The tiger's attitude, nasty and hostile was/were never captured in 3D. The whale rising out of the waters was not in 3D.

The story in the opening was well done, In parts witty and clever as hell. But overall this movie is stupid and dumb. Pi is short Piscine Molitor Tamel. Piscine Molitor is a swimming pool in Paris. Pi was named after a swimming pool. Gerard Depardieu in the script for like 60 seconds. I am a big fan of his. Gerard Depardieu was like the 3D, fleeting.

4813659,4,B005LAIII0,"I was assigned to read Yann Martel's LIFE OF PI in a college freshman lit class over Thanksgiving break.  I had the misfortune to fall sick that Monday, and was bedridden until Friday.  Martel's novel kept me company; in between bouts of passing out, I'd read about the epic journey of young Pi--a journey both physical and spiritual.  I loved the novel; after six years of college literary courses, it remains the only book I've been assigned that I subsequently went out and purchased, and reread, before the course was over.

I never expected, or wanted, to see a film version.  Like many great books, PI is rooted in its literary origins.  And as such, the film version does suffer slightly--what comes off as exciting and insightful in the novel can seem somewhat boring and lackluster (at least, plot-wise) onscreen.  This is only to be expected.  And yet, David Magee's script sticks faithfully with the novel, right down to much of the dialogue.  In the form of our tortured hero--I use the word lightly; ""protagonist"" would be a better term--we have Suraj Sharma, giving a solid performance (the fantastic Irrfan Khan plays the older Pi, with Rafe Spall playing the Writer).  The problem with the film, aside from the slow pace (which isn't nearly so slow in book form) is that Sharma is out-acted by everything around him; that's only to be expected when you have a film that looks so absolutely beautiful.  WIth vibrant colors, rich textures, and just an overal REALNESS to the cinematography, PI blew me away (and I only watched the 2D version).

But the true star here is Richard Parker, Pi's carnivorous raft-mate.  Perhaps the pinnacle of modern CGI (an actual tiger was used for some shots, but mostly it's the computers), Richard Parker comes truly to life under Ang Lee and company's masterful hands.  The fact that a fake tiger is the focal point of LIFE OF PI isn't an accident; it's a beautiful film with a dangerous edge, easily mistaken as a life-affirming, optimistic piece.  Truthfully, the film follows the novel's spirit as well as plot: you take from it what you bring to it.  Maybe its ambiguity in such matters can be counted against it; if the movie (and novel) had taken a true stand, there might be more to admire.  Still, LIFE OF PI--whichever form you approach it in, though I highly recommend the novel, even if Martel's other works fall short--is a story to make you think.  Maybe you'll walk away happy, maybe you'll walk away depressed, maybe you'll just be frustrated and confused; the point is, you'll walk away feeling SOMETHING.

4813700,4,B005LAIII0,"Yann Martel's novel, Life of Pi, had long been considered unfilmable until Oscar-winning director, Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain), did the impossible.  He (with an adaptation by screenwriter David Magee) has made a visually stunning adventure about ultimate survival and the meaning of existence in the universe.  It is a unique film experience and one that requires openness and a certain suspension of disbelief.

Pi is an impressionable young boy whose exposure to religion develops into an embracing of more than one faith much to the consternation of his father.  The family owns a zoo in the French part of India and one day are forced to uproot their lives and head to Canada by cargo ship.  During a powerful storm, the ship sinks and all hands are lost except Pi, orphaned and stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with no help and a lifeboat filled with an unlikely manifest: wild animals including a tiger, oddly named Richard Parker.  An unusual dynamic plays out as Pi struggles to stay alive in the elements and contend with the ferocious beast.  As the hours turn into days and then weeks, Pi, left with only his instincts and ingenuity, is forced to improvise and utilize all his survival skills amid dwindling supplies.  When hope begins to fade for rescue, some unlikely, awe inspiring events occur that mean the difference between life and death.

Lee, no stranger to computer generated effects (Hulk, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon), has done a major accomplishment here by adapting the challenging logistics of the source material and making it accessible and compelling to an audience.  He is no doubt aided by incredible advancements in special visual effects that form a significant portion of the film and recreate unforgettable moments including the fatal storm and the sinking cargo ship, the wondrous, luminescent phenomenon at night, and the depiction of animals in the lifeboat especially the tiger, Richard Parker, who becomes a major character.  Some of the imagery is remarkable in 3-D.

Suraj Sharma is quite convincing as the young Pi; it's a one man show for a majority of the film. The story, told in a flashback, is about Pi's ascension to manhood, and he is in essence is a citizen of the world, not having been bound to any one religion.  His curiosity and spiritual journey serve to make this an allegorical tale, and it is his relationship with Richard Parker that serves as a foundation to the story.  He wonders about his deadly companion and ponders the question, ""Do animals have souls?""  In essence, Parker is Pi's Wilson (from Castaway) but with a soul.  Pi's interaction with the ocean is not unlike the solitary figures in The Old Man and the Sea and 127 Hours, in which mother nature can be lovely and deadly, giving and taking, a sort of protagonist and antagonist.

There are unanswered questions.  What really becomes of Richard Parker? And are we to believe this fantastic tale as fact or fiction or a warped truth?  Is there a more plausible explanation?  Maybe that's just the point of the story: that life is full of questions and wonder, and sometimes truth is stranger than fiction no matter how unlikely it may appear.  Audiences who are willing to completely open their hearts and minds, will find a rewarding experience in this tragic yet fascinating exploration into the miracle of life.  And the movie does look hauntingly beautiful.",1362873600,3,3401,4.909090909090909
4813701,3,B005LAIII0,"Why you shouldn't see it:

Not to give away too much about this particular movie, but... it drags at parts. While it doesn't necessarily feel any longer than its two hour runtime, it does feel every minute of it. Have you ever watched a movie that takes place entirely on a lifeboat? Well, neither have I, but I've now seen half of a movie that takes place entirely on a lifeboat. I understand there's another movie - titled, coincidentally enough, Lifeboat - that takes place entirely on a lifeboat. Maybe someday I'll watch that Hitchcock piece, but until then I'll have to settle for this particular lifeboat-centric movie. Okay, okay, I have exaggerated slightly how much of this movie takes place on a lifeboat. The parts of the movie that take place on the lifeboat aren't technically entirely on the lifeboat, as there is also the 20-or-so-foot radius of open water around the lifeboat where some action also takes place. So there's that.

This one actually reminds me a fair amount of Cast Away in that the majority of the movie leans heavily on the ability of a single character to engage the audience's interest while he does nothing more than try to survive in extraordinary circumstances. The problem with that comparison is that Suraj Sharma is no Tom Hanks (full disclosure: I have an almost creepy respect for Tom Hanks' acting chops, so I may be biased here). While the latter half of Cast Away thrives on Hanks' ability to make otherwise mundane onscreen moments incredibly intriguing, Life of Pi just doesn't have as strong a feature actor to revolve its survival story around.

Strangely, some of the more dragging parts of the movie happen before Pi ever fatefully sets foot on a boat. Since the story isn't so much about a lifeboat as it is about a boy and the man that boy becomes, there's the sometimes regrettable necessity of building a backstory about where this person is coming from. It's hard to explain, but there is just something about this backstory that doesn't hold my attention nearly as well as others (for example, Cast Away). As a general rule, I spent a fair amount of the first half of the movie wondering things like, ""When are they getting on the boat?"", ""Why are they not on the boat yet?"", ""Why do Indians wiggle their heads like that when they talk? Do they think it conveys any message to the listener other than induced confusion?"", and, ""Wait, does this movie even have a boat in it?""

Why you should see it:

Perhaps above I didn't mention a fairly big (literally and figuratively) additional character in the movie, specifically in the lifeboat: an adult male Bengal tiger. The tiger has a name, but I won't spoil that for you, and I will just refer to it here as ""tiger."" So anyway, what you thought was going to be a nice, laid back, somewhat boring adventure on a lifeboat turns out to be, in fact, a second-by-second struggle for survival against a freaking Bengal tiger. In case you're not as familiar as I am with Bengal tigers, just know that they average 500 pounds and are considered to be the most aggressive subspecies of an animal that is known to occasionally eat people.

Tiger has a funny name in the movie, and I will give credit to the author and screenwriter for occasionally adding in appropriate moments of humor and everyday humanity into an extraordinary coming of age story. If it hadn't been for the occasional giggle moments in the first half of the movie, I'm not sure I would have made it to the second half. Well, that's an exaggeration, since I'm pretty thoroughly stubborn when it comes to finishing movies, and even more so when it comes to best picture nominees. Still, suffice it to say that there wasn't much to hold my attention for the first hour.

All that being said, there is really one main reason that anyone would want to see Life of Pi, and that reason has everything to do with an appreciation for visual art. Once the film reaches the boat, nearly every frame of the movie one could take, frame, and put it up on his or her wall. The visuals are stimulating not only due to the fact that they include crystal clear detail and vivid, saturated colors, but they also depict images that are not frequently seen. You may not be aware, but an adult male Bengal tiger does not often chill out on a lifeboat playing with flying fish in the middle of the ocean. Even in little moments, Lee finds ways to create visual art out of his material. When the opening credits are rolling over footage of a small Indian zoo, the words on the screen behave like the animals on the screen. Sometimes it's the little things.

In Short:

Life of Pi is visually breathtaking at moments and beautiful for the rest of it. If you have interest in seeing it and aren't opposed to the whole 3D phenomenon, I recommend it as a readily available way to suck you even further into the visuals Lee has created. The story drags at parts for me, and but for the payoff at the end (which I won't spoil for you), I would be happy to write the whole thing off as eye candy and nothing more. But that payoff is there, and as a consequence I've been thinking about it since I saw it almost a week ago. If it weren't for the occasional slowness of the movie itself, I would rate it higher, but for now I'll settle at a 7 out of 10 and recommend it to anyone who likes pretty things and/or exploring the nature of storytelling.

Exceptions to the recommendation:
- anyone who would prefer to believe that there is no beauty in the world;
- people who are frightened by adult male Bengal tigers (just kidding, because that should really be anyone/everyone, and I'm not going to recommend that no one see this movie just because of a healthy respect for one's own mortality when near that particular ornery feline);
- militant atheists... I guess I should have mentioned somewhere that this story is set up as proof that God exists and has a fair amount to do with religion... oops;
- racists (who aren't Indian);
- homophobes who want to stick it to Ang Lee (figuratively) for daring to make a movie about gays (this movie doesn't have any gays to my knowledge, but I figure sticking it to Lee for Brokeback Mountain by not watching Life of Pi makes about as much sense as homophobia in general);
- people who don't like irrational numbers.",1362873600,3,6295,4.54320987654321

Two weeks later I decided to go see the movie again, but this time in 3D. It was a completely different experience. I felt like I was sitting through an entirely different story. I have to admit, I didn't think this was a movie worth the extra $4 for the 3D ticket as it was not your fast action, fast paced action flick. I was sorely mistaken.

4813932,3,B005LAIII0,"I was interested in Ang Lee's new film ""Life of Pi"" not because of the director (though I really like his films especially ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""), but because of the actor in it. Some film fans might remember the name of Irrfan Khan, who played a police inspector interrogating the protagonist of Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire.""

In this film adaptation of a Booker Prize-winner Yann Martel's novel of the same title, Irrfan Khan plays an adult ""Pi"" Patel living in Canada, who is being interviewed by a writer (Rafe Spall replacing Tobey Maguire). In the flashbacks that follow, Pi recounts why he came to called Pi; and how he survived a shipwreck and the subsequent 227 days on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger named ""Richard Parker.""

People would watch this movie with different expectations. What you get is its beautiful photography by Claudio Miranda (""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"") and comfortable background score by Mychael Danna. The cast is all very good, including a newcomer Suraj Sharma as young 16-year-old Pi Patel.

And there is a story that is beautifully told. While Ang Lee deftly keeps the narrative flowing with rich visuals, however, we are constantly made aware that, well-told as it is, this is just a ""story."" The film's brief third act, where we are asked to choose between two alternatives, makes me feel that even a talented player like Irrfan Khan cannot make the film's brief conclusion concerning power of storytelling (or whatever philosophical theme you might find) convincing or moving.

You will be asked: ""Which do you prefer?"" I might ask: ""What if we are not free to choose?"" The boy's 227-day journey with the tiger is so absorbing that the answer is already made. Even if you don't notice who the ""Richard Parker"" is (no, not a comic book character; there are more than one, real-life and fictional), you would most likely to choose the same one as ""the writer"" does. As some reviewers have pointed out, the presence of the tiger suggests something more complicated and even sinister, which the film tries to gloss over.

I am not saying ""Life of Pi"" is not worth watching. There is a good reason why some people say that the film is a triumph of storytelling. Still, I cannot help feeling that some stories are better left to the imagination, especially when those stories should be open to our interpretation.",1362355200,,2376,4.85679012345679

The beginning of this movie well lets say the first um 30 minutes of the movie were pretty ugg slow. I was bored out of my mine with it i swear. It was so slow and boring that i thought about leaving the theater and seeing Red Dawn but i didn't. The beginning was just um well it didn't fit with the rest of the film and was not very nessesary to me. I mean all of that story about religion and falling for a girl for about five minutes then leaving her i mean come on was all of that nessesary really???? No it was not. The acting in the beginning was great but all together unnessesary. It was boring with only the part with the tiger being interesting. But after that half an hour the film started to get great, i mean really really good. The huge storm scene with the ship was epic, it was really, really cool. Actually there were lots of scenes that i found amazingly beautiful like the part with the whale and the animals who looked infact real but they were not they were animated but they were done so well they looked real. The second thing that i didn't enjoy was the removal of Tobey Maguire. Tobey Maguire was like way better at his acting as the writer then Rafe Spall was way better and sents the director decided to cut tobey like 2 months from the films release they had to like rush the reshoots and it made those scenes look well bad it was sad they cut him. It was a really bad move. Ok the good stuff well you already heard about the beauty in the film but i will still talk more about it, the acting in particuler the newcomer Suraj Sharma who to me did a realistic and great preformence, the cast,The director , the animation, the scenery , and everything else. Ok almost every scene int his film looks like a diamond all sparkly and well pollashed, i'm not stretching the point they made every scene look better then the scene before it was just so pretty and man did i want to eat it up loved it. It was just so cool. The acting was very very good outside of Rafe Spall everybody looked like they really were enjoying filming of Life of Pi, Suraj Sharma in particuler gave a 101 % in trying he was great i loved him. I thought sad to say i thought he was going to give a really bad preformence but when i saw the film he was just amazing. Man Suraj Sharma has real talent in acting he does i hope the best for him. In the future i hope he is able to get more good leading film roles cause he deserves them he really does which leads me into my next conversation about the casting. Man i'm sad to say that now adays directors only cast well known actors in their movies like Will Ferral or Kevin James but the director who is really greatchose a cast of well newcomers who had little to no acting experience which worked for everyone but for the cutting of tobey who we already talked about. I believe directors should cast no more then 2 well known actors and put them in supporting roles with little advertisment on them sort of like Alice in Wonderland but they advertised the Mad Hater who was played by Johnny Depp like he was the main charactor and put him on the posters but they rarly advertised alice who IS the main charactor and she is not even on the poster i mean whats up with that its really stupid!!! The director was very good with casting which leads me into my next subject on the director. I rarly talk about directors when i review a film but i believe this director deserves some praise from me. The director was Ang Lee he was outstanding he was. The way he cast the film , produced the film , and brought the charactors onto the big screen , were amazing he is now in my top five best directors list he is, i loved him, he is great !!! The visual effects of the film are top notch. As i said before all the animals look real even though they are not and the water and the ship sinking and the whale flying and the meer cats were so real i mean it was so good the animation was !!! The scenery was pretty awesome to like the island and india it was so cool to see it really was. All an All Life of Pi is an amazing award winner that is so Beautiful and all the Effert put into making this film makes this film an instant hit for people all over the world !!! A+ .

4814017,4,B005LAIII0,"this review is on the blu ray version of the movie as follows-
movie - 4 / 5
video - 4.5 / 5
audio - 5 / 5

revised review-

good video and great audio on this blu ray, however the movie itself was only just a 4 / 5 for me. the only part of the movie regarding video quality that did not hold 'water ' for me was the ship sinking part, did not find the special effects were well done.
viewed it twice already, with no change regarding rating on the movie itself.
however, still a good addition for your blu ray collection.

4814022,5,B005LAIII0,"There're lots of 3D movies, and lots of movies with great story lines on the market nowadays. But if you combine the two, most of them either don't have a very terrific story, or have poor 3D technology or the scenes are not so fantastic that you really want 3D for it.
So Life of Pi is one of those which you want the 3D version because of the beautiful scenes, and the collector's edition because of the great story.
Different from others who focus on which story is true in the movie, I personally don't think that matters. The title of the movie is ""Life"" of Pi. I read it as a movie of the life of an Indian boy, also the life of any ordinary person. We were on the big ship with our parents when we were children, and went on our own boat when we grew up. There were many obstacles and dangers in life. And we are fighting with our own fear and sloth all the time. If you don't give up, you will arrive at the shore, which in Buddhism is the metaphor of wisdom and fulfillment of life.
I love the story. I love the scenes. And I love Richard Parker (as I am a cat lover!). This is the first movie I will buy the 3D blue-ray collector's edition of.",1362096000,3,1153,4.06140350877193

4814157,5,B005LAIII0,In all honesty I was anti the movie from the start but I love tigers.  They are amazingly beautiful but very dangerous animals.  So I watched it because of the tiger.  I am not sure if I would have enjoyed it as much if it had not been a tiger.  Maybe so.  The story is well written and told.  It is in someways about redemption of the soul.  It is about God's mighty hand.  It will make you think and an ending that leaves you wondering.  It is an amazing movie.,1361923200,3,463,4.0

I just saw 'Life of Pi', my favorite film so far this year and in my Top 10 Films of all time. From the opening credits I knew it was going to be something special ... but I can't remember ever having seen a film that touched me this deeply on the subject of faith. Visually stunning, the film - on the surface a story about a shipwrecked young man trapped alone on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger - reaches out with such a powerful message of faith and courage and devotion, it left me shaken and weak and realizing just how meaningless much of what we humans worry about really is. Ang Lee deserves the Oscar, Suraj Sharma should have been nominated for playing Pi, and this is one I will be owning the nano-second it comes out on DVD.

4814356,5,B005LAIII0,"I saw ""Life of Pi"" last night and absolutely loved it.  I still feel so overwhelmed by it, its visual splendor and the moving story that kept me involved for the whole time. The latest Ang Lee's film is beauty itself, and everyone involved in creation of such sparkling intelligent and classy entertainment deserves the highest praise and admiration for the work they've done.  I am sure that in two days, ""Life of Pi"" will receive majority of Oscars it is nominated for. It deserves them.

I hesitated to see it because I did not think that the movie about a boy and a tiger stuck together in the middle of the ocean for months after the horrible shipwreck on the drifting lifeboat which the ferocious tiger first claimed as his territory and a makeshift inflatable raft chained to it which was Pi's fragile shelter would be so compelling and gripping but it was. Roger Ebert said that Life of Pi is ""a miraculous achievement of storytelling and a landmark of visual mastery"". I gladly agree with that. I simply can't find anything wrong with ""Life of Pi."" It is beautiful, profound and adventurous story of survival and understanding life with all it offers or throws at us.  It is life affirming even though it takes us along with Pi Patel through unspeakable hardship, losses, and deadly danger of indifferent and indomitable forces of nature's elements and wild creatures. And it manages to say a lot about faith and God without being over-simplistic, preachy or shoving religion in your face. It does help an atheist to understand the believers or at least to try. It also turns itself in unexpected direction when we thought we were in the end of the journey, reflects on the darkest corners of human nature and leaves the viewers asking questions on what they really want to believe and whether they are open to the possibility of miracle in life, in their lives. It is up to the viewers to choose the answer only they would be satisfied with.

Peaceful beauty of Pondicherry, former French colony in India that surprisingly for me looked like a charming small French town, totally enthralled me in the beginning of the film that started as a typical coming of age story. Well, it is coming of age story but amazing on so many levels, spiritual, ethical, physical, religious, humanistic, testing the limits of what a human being can deal with and how it would shape him, his life, and his perception of life.  This is an experience, both movie watching and afterthought that will stay with me. What else can I ask for in a movie?  I've always respected and admired Ang Lee and found his movies exquisite. But ""Life of  Pi"" is without doubt his best work. Furious tiger, brave boy, magic journey, fascinating story - amazing movie.",1361491200,9,2738,4.689583333333333
4814357,5,B005LAIII0,"Ang Lee's ""Life of Pi"" is a masterpiece with some of the most beautiful and unforgettable images ever displayed on film. Not only did it give me an experience of the wonder in being alive while moving me to tears, but its story also encompassed a human life from childhood to mature age while dealing with pain and guilt that are part of the human experience.

Ang Lee isn't thought of as an Asian auteur in the class of Wong Kar-wai, Zhang Yimou or Lee Chang-dong. He's actually more of a commercial director than a personal artist, but what he does in transferring the ""Life of Pi"" from novel to screen is miraculous.  Perhaps no director has ever captured the beauty and fear of the power of life, and when you look deep into the eyes of the tiger ""Richard Parker"", you see what Marlowe saw in Kurtz's eyes in Conrad's ""The Heart of Darkness"": a power so vast it dwarfs you with an awareness of your mortality, showing you your insignificance beside the powers of all life.  What Ang Lee does here in this film will, I believe, remain his tour-de-force, and is a work of art I will come to many times in the future.

The acting is wonderful, primarily Irrfan Khan, one of India's greatest actors who plays the adult Pi.  Khan provides an entire acting course just in the way he uses his face, displaying a smile in the film's climax that rivals the Mona Lisa's in its ambiguity.  You see the world of pain, guilt, joy and sadness in his delicate expression.

The film is supremely spiritual in every frame, yet, if one is paying attention, it winds up as somewhat of a Trojan Horse in what it ultimate reveals about religion.  I'm trying hard not to provide a spoiler here, but there are five words spoken by the adult Pi at the end of the film that viewers seem to miss that spell it out.  But moving away from its theme, no film I have ever seen in my life comes close to ""Life of Pi"" in relating the sheer force of nature (making you experience the beauty and terror in the soul of a tiger) and the cosmic beauty of our world, both inner and outer.  Using 3-D more brilliantly (and essentially) than any film to date, this film burned into my mind incredible visual sights impossible to find anywhere else, showing me beauty I will remember the rest of my life.

Highly recommended, and one that truly deserves to be seen in 3-D.",1361491200,104,2335,4.3944315545243615

Life of Pi was spectacular film-making.  It's one of those movies that seem more than a movie.  It's quite the transformative experience.  Ang Lee's work is genius.

4814361,5,B005LAIII0,"""Life of Pi"" is another stunning example of Lee's artistry, one that defies any formulaic account of how the magic of life in all its delicate detail is brought to screen. Lee's sensibility is primed to make the best of the literary adaptation of the Booker Prize winning novel by Yan Martel. The trials following ""Pi"" Patel the youngest member of the Patel Family, zookeepers who have resolved to move from their native Pondicherry, in India, to Canada, is brought to screen with subtlety at so many levels that one cannot help but marvel at Lee's sense for storytelling, his eye for talent, and for his ability to bring to life the many emotional registers of this story of a resilient father lost to a son, and a son who in turn manages to bring that father's life lessons to bear on his quest to accomplish what is truly grand in life. Pi's rage to find a response to the final questions he has on God, the meaning of life, and the vast array of philosophies that merges and emerges growing up in the heart of the great tropics - India - is the grandest example of a cinematic ""trip"" we have had all year.

The scenes with ""Pi"" telling his story in flashback, of his quest for religious unity in a world where Gods and Dieties abound and haunt his imagination, his conversations with books late into the night, along with altercations and loving interludes with his close and inseparable family is contrasted with the uncompromising self-reliant individualism that Pi is subjected to in that fateful journey across the seas. The long migration to Canada initially seems like a fool's quest but the deeper emotional notes in Pi's odyssey across the seas has an empowering tragic sense of life that has no equal this year at the movies.

Ang Lee stretches his own range of interests in his quest for a deeper emotional connection with religious themes in Martel's novels. Pi's lone quest in a raft, struggling to come to terms with his demons, in the open sea, also opens up a range of interpretations. Depending on your interpretive mood and fancy, Pi's altercations with a Tiger, Orangutan, and Zebra, could be taken as real or figurative/hallucinatory encounters.

The sheer beauty and detail of the digital imagery that unfolds on screen, the breathtaking vision of young Pi lost in the ocean is, in and of itself, only spectacle. But these visuals, become a beautiful, even consoling, vision of a human being absorbed in his infinite struggles and longings. The brilliant decorative pieces on the cinematic canvas become vast signifiers of life's deepest meanings. And none of this gets ponderous, or pretentious. This is a tale told simply, furiously, of Pi's resolve, of his sadness, love, loss, and protests. Pi's scream in a crucial hallucinatory moment, when he is numbed by thirst, hunger, and exhaustion, and face to face with his father, his mother, his brother, lying deep in the ocean, in a cry of protest, is the best single scene at the movies this year. His protest transcends the infinite stretches of the skies and the ocean above and below him.  Lee's attention to Pi's anguish, this moral epicenter of this grand visual spectacle, is a moment on screen that reminded me, again, of the aesthetic power of cinema. Great directors do this constantly and Ang Lee manages to bring these moments to the screen this year more than any other film I have seen. A young man striving to remain true to his calling, as a son, an orphan, and finally a representative human being striving beyond his native strength, is a great moment of cinema, where tragedy and triumph meet without separation.

Lee shows how he has developed mastery over stories that have incredible reserves of human emotion when it is handled with deftness. Lee knows when to let the narrative drift in the high seas of this drama and he also knows when to build and unleash those transcendent moments in his careful staging of the characters and scenes, in some truly unforgettable flights of cinematic artistry. This is an old fashioned story, in turns allegorical and deeply human, that relies on Lee's control, his unerring sense of timing and quiet artistry, his impeccable awareness of how to control the tension in the drama during its ebbs and flows.

This story of Pi Patel and his family is perhaps Ang Lee's best film since ""Sense and Sensibility"" and his underestimated Hulk (2003) and is also my pick for the best movie of the year.

Lee is at the peak of his powers, doing what he does best, in his third decade as a major director, with his delicate perceptive powers coming into its own in its fullest expression. ""Life of Pi"" is literary material with a moral theme that can turn stiff, dull, and pretentious in less able directorial hands. But Ang Lee manages to keep his explorations of the triumph and tragedy of life on screen well within the bounds of taste to make Pi's unraveling tragic story a redeeming one. What is on display here is the simple miracle of family life, its redeeming power, despite the tensions and tragedies that abound on the surface.",1361145600,13,5062,4.738933030646992
4814362,5,B005LAIII0,"I think this is an excellent and gripping film and worthwhile seeing for older children, teenagers and adults. Most of all, it is about a young Hindu boy's spiritual journey, and for me the main theme is how he grew to give complete surrender to God for control of his present and future. There is a wonderful balance of humour with the tragedy and suspense in the film. The joke about his name is slightly vulgar, but funny all the same, and so typical of some little boys. I totally understand some people's concerns about the different religions mentioned, and there is a slight leaning toward the idea that all religions are equal. However, as his father says in the movie--you have to choose one road and to choose all of them is to have nothing!

There are many Christian references contained in the film. These include Pi saying that he found Christ, the priest quotes John 3:16, Pi is shown praying and seems to pray to accept Christ, he says grace before every meal and says amen, mention is made of Jesus' Sacrifice and how He died for the sins of many when He had not sinned, the fact that he refers to himself as Catholic first, and his request to be baptized. The way I take it is that he still has his East Indian culture, but identifies himself as a Christian.

It's a movie that can be appreciated on many different levels, and there is symbolism in the story, if you choose to see it. I wish I could get some other people's feelings on the symbolism of the tiger. To me he was representative of the boy's family with whom he was on a life journey, but they didn't get to say goodbye and to say thank you for all they had meant to each other. The tiger gave him life in many ways, and so did his family.

As you're probably gathering, this movie can be taken in many different ways. This is not a movie for young children due to the graphic nature of the ship wreck, some of the animal deaths, and how scary it is in some places because of the tiger living with him on the boat in the middle of the ocean. Also, take your motion sickness pills before going. After about an hour on the sea, I really started to feel it, ha ha. The 3D effects and cinematography are really quite stunning and if this movie doesn't win some Oscars I will be very much surprised.

I cannot say enough about the performance of Suraj Sharma who gave a brilliant acting performance. He is so believable as Pi and with this being his first film, I'd say he is a natural actor. Pi's romance is absolutely adorable as well.  As a Canadian I loved the Canadian reference to Winnipeg. Apparently the writer of the book is a Canadian.

4814441,2,B005LAIII0,"The movie is like a puddle that pretends to be a sea.

The plot is simple, though it does not mean that simple plots go with bad movies. It's just a fact that the plot is not that sophisticated:

The main character tells a writer a long story with a promise that after hearing it, the writer will believe in God. So the storyteller tells how he survived a disaster at sea, sailing in a boat with a Bengal tiger. At the end of the story the teller suddenly says that it was not true and tells an alternative, more scarier story of his survival without the tiger. Then the teller asks the writer which story he prefers. The writer chooses the first story, with the tiger. And the teller says that it goes with God. As simple as that.

I'm surprised that the movie's budget was 150 mil. Where is the money? In 3D and visual effects? Do they call it movies nowadays? For me, a good movie is a well-told story, not a show of technical progress. I wanted to see a story of a spiritual odyssey, personal growth, how the main character loses or obtains his faith, how a boy becomes a man, but it was all so shallow that I feel cheated.

Why should someone believe in God if he listens to the story? Why does the first story go with God and why can't the second story go with God? What's wrong with it? Does the author mean that believing in good sweet stories means to have faith? Is God just a palatable story that people choose to believe? Why does the truth must be something that one choose to believe in? Why does the boy start believing in 3 religions and finish at the same level? He does not change, does not growth, doesn't question his faith.

Was he searching for God? He was but where is his journey? He is not an ""enlightened"" person but still the same nave young boy, a flat cartoon character all the time. He starts as a nave believer and ends up as a nave believer, no lapses, no temptations, and no spiritual growth. Did he ""surrender"" to God? So what? It does not make the story more intelligent or spiritual, or less cooked up and artificial.

I do not want to choose neither story because I do not like them both. Neither story proves anything for me. To me, it's mainly a story about how a boy tamed a tiger sailing in one boat. The rest - so called ""layers"" and allegories are nonsense, attempts to add depth to look wise and philosophical but in fact, it's just a substitute of a true spiritual journey. It's an ersatz spirituality taught by an ersatz guru.

A friend of mine asked me who I think Richard Parker (the tiger) was in fact? I have no idea. It's an open-ended question. There are no right or wrong answers, I guess. The answer that one believes is ""true"" - must be the true answer for the believer. It could be the tiger, it could be the boy (since he had known the tiger since the Zoo times), it could be God or personal relationships of God and the boy, it could be the boy's animal nature, it could be his relative, it could be the cook (why not?), it could be just a fruit of the boy's imagination, or Yann Martel (the author) himself, or it could mean
all things together at the same or different time.

There is a chance that none story is real, so it's hard to explore Martel's mind and tell what he meant creating the puzzle. I do not think that Martel is a fool but when I'm thinking of the movie, I am recalling this Italian saying: ""A fool can ask more questions than seven wise men can answer."" Well, I can also ask more questions than seven wise men can answer, but I do not pretend to be smart.

Like it or not, to me the story sounds fake, artificial, and cartoon-like. It's a beautiful 3D postcard as flat as it is, not a true spiritual odyssey with trials, ordeals, and temptations.

Talking about personal journeys and spiritual growth, I prefer The Odyssey.

PS If you enjoyed the movie and did not find my review helpful, could you please answer a few questions and explain your point of view?

I am a Christian. I believe in omnipotent (all powerful), omniscient (all knowing), and omnipresent (existing everywhere at once, always present) God. You may have different beliefs. Hold on them and try to look at the story without its beautiful visual effects.

Suppose, an illegal immigrant's boat sank somewhere in Florida and the
illegal immigrant was saved by the US Coast Guard. The guardsmen who are
atheist, Jewish, Buddhist, Muslim, and Christian ask the guy, ""What
are you doing here? Are you American?"" And the immigrant says, ""Chill out,
guys! After hearing my story, you will believe in God."" And he starts
telling them how he survived 227 days after a shipwreck, sailing in the boat
together with a crocodile, a cat, and a dog. He suffered a lot. The
crocodile ate the dog and the cat. There was no food. To survive, the
illegal immigrant had to learn fishing and even tame the beast. Then there was a
storm. The immigrant surrendered to God and together with the crocodile
reached the US coast where the crocodile escaped.

Will the guardsmen believe the story? Of course, not. They will ask the
illegal immigrant to stop bulls***ing them and tell them the real story. So
the illegal immigrant tells them another story, where he sailed in the boat
together with a criminal who killed his two friends, other illegal
immigrants. The guardsmen say, ""Another bulls***, but we can't prove which
story is real."" The immigrant says, ""It's your problem. But if you
prefer the first story, you must know that it goes with God.""

Questions: Will the atheist guardsmen believe in God after hearing the story? How will the immigrant's story prove them the existence of God? Why does the first story go with God and what's wrong with the second? Why can't the second story prove the existence of God? Will the first story support the beliefs of the Jewish, Muslim, and Christian guardsmen?.. Thanks.",1360108800,9,6065,4.596669750231268

  We join the story of Piscine Molitor Patel in adulthood. Piscine, known as Pi (played by Irfan Khan) is an Indian living in Canada. One day, a young novelist comes to his door after being referred by a friend of his. Named after a swimming pool by his parents, Piscine came by his nickname after exhaustive chiding of his given name by classmates in school. His father ran a local zoo and Pi took an intense, and as far as his father was concerned, unhealthy, interest in the zoo's sole tiger. Named Richard Parker as the result of a clerical error, the tiger is fed a live goat while Pi bears witness in an effort by his father to instill an appropriate amount of fear. Though raised as a Hindu, Pi (played as an adolescent by Ayush Tandon) discovers Christianity as the result of a dare from his older brother and, by sheer chance, discovers Islam sometime after. As an adult, he refers to himself as a Catholic Hindu. At 16, Pi's father decides to close the zoo, sell the animals and move the family to Canada. This is a crushing development in the life of our main character as he has just fallen in love for the first time. The family and the animals make their journey west on a Japanese freighter. Woken by a severe storm, Pi goes to the top deck to marvel at the magnitude of the waves, wind, and rain. It is that extremely questionable decision which lands him in a lifeboat while his family and the rest of the crew sink with the ship. All this would make his chances of survival slim enough, but for better or worse, he's not alone in the boat. With him is Richard Parker the tiger, an orangutan he refers to as Orange Juice a zebra and a hyena.

  This is an incredible movie. Some would say elements of the story are too fantastic to be believable but, with the first film in The Hobbit trilogy and the alleged final chapter in the Twilight saga currently in theaters, those objections seem hollow, to say the least. The struggle between man and beast and the eventual development of a symbiotic relationship between the two make for an extremely gripping tale. It's made even more so by the trials and tribulations they both encounter in their fight to survive. I thoroughly enjoyed Life of Pi, and wish I'd seen it sooner.",1359849600,4,2417,4.444695259593679

This is what i murmured to a couple of ushers, (standing outside of the theatre I had been sentenced to spend time inside) they, mercifully standing outside of viewing and hearing distance from this.. movie. (Yes i was jealous..) I had never been so happy to have drinken too much soda. While in the restroom I remember thinking- ""Boy! Would this be a good time for a kidney stone!"".

This has to be one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. The best part of Life of Pi were the 15 minutes I snuck away to watch Skyfall. While it may have been a good read, what you're subjected to onscreen for me was unbearable. This movie is basically a slower and chattier version of Cast Away. But with a tiger. Who apparently is a vegetarian. Life of Pi makes Cast Away look like Speed Racer.

It's also a drug movie. Vivid colors and visuals are apparent throughout- dancing dolphins and whales singing showtunes in the sky and such.

4814496,5,B005LAIII0,"First of all, if you like to enjoy a film in its purest and unanticipated sense, just know Ang Lee's Life of Pi is a spectacular cinematic experience. Now stop reading and go see it. For the rest of you, prepare yourself for The People's Critic to convince you that you should find a two-hour break in your day to go see this movie.

Ang Lee has been one of those directors who can shatter cultural bias and stereotype and make films that cut to the bone of virtually any genre, culture, or philosophy. A Taiwanese filmmaker, Lee disappears into his material like no other filmmaker. His personal stamp on a film is simply that he gets it right. The Ice Storm revealed his ability to poetically peel the layers off of the American suburban lifestyle and reveal some of the chaos that lies beneath the calm, picturesque surface. His adaptation of Jane Austen's Victorian Romance Sense and Sensibility was pitch perfect. Additionally he has shown a steady hand at vividly visual genre films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Brokeback Mountain. These films bare little resemblance to each other, except that they ""get it right."" Furthermore, no better example for Lee's ""getting it right"" can be given than his adaptation of Yann Martel's Life of Pi.

Life of Pi is a narrative framed by Pi as an adult(Ifran Kahn) telling his story to a writer. This frame story can be summed up by paraphrasing a quote by the writer who says he's a Canadian who went to French-India looking for a story only to find there's an Indian in French-Canada with a story to tell. The film then transports us back to French-India in the late 1970s where Pi(now played by Suraj Sharma) begins an epic tale of self-discovery.

Now, clearly most viewers will be eagerly awaiting the story of the guy on a boat with a tiger, but this film is much more than this. It is a religious film, but it does not preach. Instead, it takes into consideration all of the ideas, beliefs, doubts, and misconceptions that exist and simply tells a story. Do not overlook or underestimate the film's opening act; the setup is as rewarding as the visual magnificence that is to follow. Needless to say, it is the visual effects and cinematic beauty that will doubtless be the conversation surrounding Life of Pi and deservedly so. From the moment the map of the Mariana Trench appears on the screen, hold on to your seats! No film, including Avatar, has achieved this level of visual grandeur with 3D technology. What is more, Life of Pi exists right here on our own planet. Lee's careful precision as a director, takes full advantage of every opportunity to amaze the audience with wonder.

Inevitably, Pi does find himself in the unique situation of living on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger. However, this is all that is unique about it. Many films have explored the survivor element of what the limits of human endurance are. What allows Pi to rise above those is the spiritual depth that is created from the film's opening act and the awe-inspiring visual effects that are second to none.

Life of Pi is a low-key masterpiece. It sneaks up on you and while not complicated, welcomes multiple viewings. The opening credits depicting animals happily living in captivity holds new meaning after experiencing the film for the first time. Lee presents a very enjoyable and thought-provoking version of Martel's widely admired source material. It was said that Life of Pi was one of those unfilmable stories- that it can exist in the mind of the reader and nowhere else. Lee has proven those skeptics incorrect; however, this film is more than a companion or adaptation of the novel. It has surpassed that into something much more special and distinctive. A

I was very pleased with the depiction of the Roman Catholic Church, it was complimentary for once...this time there were no demons, and Holy water didn't scald; there were no exorcisms or ugly gargoyles.-but a message of love and serenity  accepting the challenges of life with the help of Jesus the son of God. Beautiful.
The scenes involving the animals ( both before the shipwreck and after), were difficult to watch ( I closed my eyes) and yes I cringed with the scenes involving the Hyenna, but recovered because I was curious to see the rest. The Bengali tiger scenes were well done and I enjoyed the beauty of this animal. This savage beast was symbolic of our own human resilience, and I found found myself cheering for him to survive and felt sad for him, too...wow. the Bengali tiger reminded me of dog of mine, a Siberian Husky, who was alpha male, intelligent and very high maintenance.
I picked this movie over the others at the movie theater because of its length as well. At just a bit over 2 hours it was the right amount of time to sit for me. Still, I missed a bit at the end because I had to go to the ladies room. ( The movies are getting longer and longer nowadays and I prefer to sit for a play if it's more than 2 1/2 hours with the luxury of a break for intermission.
The 3-D experience was new to me, I haven't been interested in anything 3-D before..the scene with the fish as if floating out out of the screen was awesome...and the glowing flower, wow I can't top that. I was removing my 3-D eyeglasses from time to time to see whether there was a marked difference....I can't say I will watch  it in 3-D again, but certainly will watch it over and over at home when it comes out on DVD or Blue Ray.",1358640000,5,2146,4.283251231527093
4814498,4,B005LAIII0,"I'll review this for your benefit, not mine. That is, I may value certain aspects of a movie more or less than you do, or vice versa. For example, someone who flees the room if there's any violence in a movie won't want to see this firm, despite its PG rating. There's violence and it's a scary movie at times. Not like, say, ""Saving Private Ryan"" but it isn't an episode of ""Friends"" either.

And after seeing this film last night (and never having read the book or read about the book), I would make a few blanket recommendations:

1. See this in 3D unless 3D makes you oopsy (as it does a friend of my wife's). I think most people would agree that this film goes far past poke-you-in-the 3D, but instead makes the visual depth integral with the cinematography.
2. See this in Blu-Ray if not in a theater. Its visual quality is both right up there at the state of the art, AND it's a major part of the film's appeal.
3. Avoid reading any other reviews of the film but this one before you see it, because I won't give you any spoilers, and most reviewers--pro and amateur--do. And in the case of ""Life of Pi"" it's really important to avoid spoilers. This movie is especially skillful at giving nothing away as you go along, while not ""cheating"" and hiding anything either. A friend who had seen it before warned me to suspect my sense of disbelief for this--that I wouldn't be sorry afterwards, despite my tendency to dissect-as-I-go, and she was right.

Why you might not want to see this film:

1. It's not a typical ""good"" Hollywood film, with a propulsive plot and an array of famous stars you enjoy watching in films. None of the actors are much known in America. So despite some intense action sequences, on the whole it's not a swiftly-paced film.

2. It's not a love story. And if you enjoy watching beautiful men and women interact onscreen for a couple of hours, this ain't that. It's a half-naked 17 year old boy not interacting with other people through most of it (though not uninterruptedly).

3. It's not an action movie per se.

4. It's not a horror movie, and it's not really any other well-known genre. I was reminded a bit of Terence Malick's films like ""The Thin Red Line,"" which is more a meditation on war than a regular war movie.

5. This is a bit of a judgment call, but I'd say the screenwriting and acting are competent but not spectacular. However, the visuals throughout are spectacular. The plot is interesting, though some say it isn't as philosophically deep as it thinks it is. Could be; not a big problem for me.

6. If you're a religious ideologue, firmly committed to your faith--whatever it is--and believing all other faiths are worthless and must be shunned, you're going to find this off-putting. Maybe you could watch it with the sound off for the glorious visuals.

7. I would have taken my kids to see this film when they were young, but only after talking about it with them to make sure they wanted to see a film that skirts the upper end of violence and scary action acceptable in a PG film. Parents who are raising their kid in a ""sweetness & light"" bubble shouldn't take their kids to see it.

Why you might want to see it:

1. The absolute state of the art in 3D cinematography and mise-en-scene, and in a director exploiting 3D for narrative effect and not just 3D for 3D's sake.

2. A tale that's more interesting in retrospect than it was during most of the movie--it definitely left me mulling it over afterwards, and satisfyingly so.

3. Absence of the shadow big box office stars cast over a story.

4. If you're a scuba diver like me, or just like watching underwater specials, there are some great visuals for us here, and as a diver I can tell you that the underwater stuff is solidly reality-based, fantastic though some of it seems. Probably the same goes for anyone who's a naturalist of some sort. A lot of Wonders of Nature here.

5. If you're religious but very ecumenical or nonreligious but not judgmental about religion (except for the fundamentalist stuff), you'll probably enjoy this movie. It definitely has that ""we are all One with the Infinite, and it/them/him/her with us"" vibe.

6. It doesn't anthropomorphize the animals in the film. Unsentimental, really.

7. If you're a woman or a homosexual man you might enjoy watching a half-naked 17 year old youth for the better part of two hours. Me being neither this wasn't a drawing card for me but I'm sure it would be for some, and my job here isn't to tell myself whether or not to see it, but to tell you--whoever you are.

8. This is one of those films that I think will be talked about for years, so it you're a film buff, you probably need to have seen it just to keep up with movie conversations.

9. This would be a great movie to see with the whole family and talk about afterwards, as long as your kids can handle the most violence & scary action possible for a film to have & still get a PG rating.

----------------------------------------------------

I didn't leave the theater powerfully moved, but then I AM a scuba diver, so I've seen a lot of marine stuff myself, up close and personal. I thoroughly enjoyed it, though--enough to write a review here.

One last note: I've been stranded by myself in the open ocean with no rescue in sight several times. It only lasted a matter of minutes, but I can tell you it's an intense experience even when it's short (one time after a night dive on a moonless night in an obscure chain of islands west of New Guinea was especially intense). So I can relate to the castaway aspect of this film--which is its heart in some ways--in ways that are outside the personal experience of most filmgoers. And I think this does a fair job of capturing that feeling. It brought back my memories of floating along in the water pretty strongly!

I will have other conversations about ""Life of Pi"" with friends who have seen it, but I won't spoil it for you by going into those aspects.",1358640000,12,5951,4.478743068391867
4814499,5,B005LAIII0,"Another Ang Lee masterpiece! With the fabulous 3D, I felt like I was there!  I believe it is a story about the necessity of coming to terms with our inner tiger--we can't live without it (survival instincts, ambition, drive) but we can't allow it to devour us either (greed, violence,agression). To me, ""The Life of Pi"" is a modern fairytale--not necessarily true in outer, physical reality butvery true in ""inner"", psychological reality. The animation was so good, I could never really tell when the tiger was real or animated. The film is paced just right--never slow or rushed. The colors are gorgeous and rich and photography is sensational.",1358294400,7,645,4.972222222222222
4814500,5,B005LAIII0,"This tale deals with a boy in 1950s India who finds God in many forms and is then persuaded by his father during a violent incident with a Bengal Tiger that God does not quite exist as suspected. Years pass and then when he loses his entire family aboard a sea vessel and that he's stranded on a lifeboat with a ferocious tiger that he once again ""sees"" God in many forms.

What follows is up to your opinion. Some would call it a spiritual journey and others would name it a massive hallucination to deal with the loss of his family and the horrors he faces. The beauty of this film is that either interpretation is correct. Too often these types of films pick one solid belief and then fight for it at the expense of other interpretations.

Yes, that nasty chef was Gerard Depardieu.

If you want something different yet engaging this is worth the price of admission but be warned it drags a bit in the middle hence my not so perfect grade for STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING.

4814544,1,B005LAIII0,"The movie has great visuals and an interesting story. Unfortunately, the fact that the story was stolen makes it impossible for me to enjoy it. The one star goes to the special effects.

The book that gave origin to the movie is a PLAGIARISM from the book ""Max and the Feline"" , from Brazilian author Moacyr Scliar. It is ironic that Ang Lee tries to discuss metaphysical and religious themes when he is guilty of accessory to theft. One's morality should begin at home, I suppose. Does anyone care ? I guess not. We have fallen into such a sad state of lack of morals that anything goes today.

It is EXACTLY the same story. Shame on you, Ang Lee, shame on you, Yan Martell. Go have an original idea. Plagiarism hurts art and artists.

I am surprised and sad that most people just don't care at all about the plagiarism, which is blatant. Unfortunately, Scliar was a tired old man (he has died since) and just didn't have the resources and patience to sue. I hope his heirs do.

Google Scliar for many articles about the plagiarism that were on the press.

At least the movie should have a mention ""from the original story from Moacyr Scliar"". Martel was so dishonest that he said he had only read a (non-existent) review of the book, but the story is the same: someone who flees from a country in a boat full of animals, suffers a shipwreck and survives in a dinghy with a feral feline (in the original story, it was a jaguar). For goodness sake, people have been sued for 10% of this.",1357430400,27,1487,4.412408759124087
4814545,5,B005LAIII0,"It's been four years since Slumdog Millionaire took home eight Oscars. I found myself thinking of that movie because Life of Pi opens in India and the cast is predominantly comprised of Indian actors. Like Slumdog Millionaire, the movie uses several actors to portray the main character at different ages. In fact, the older Pi is played by Irrfan Khan, who appears in both movies.

The story is framed with the older Pi relating his story to a writer. We learn that Pi's father owned a zoo, and his mother worked there as a botanist. His father is fond of giving Pi advice, and one memorable lesson involves a demonstration of how dangerous tigers can be, and that they should not be treated like a pet or a friend.

Pi is shown at four different ages, but the bulk of the story shows Pi as a young man, so Suraj Sharma receives the most screen time. Like Cast Away and 127 Hours, the movie relies on one actor holding our attention, and Sharma does a wonderful job of doing just that. It's his first role and he had to show a vast range of emotions in order for everything to work.

The first part of the movie shows Pi's life as a young boy. We see him go to school, and ultimately fall in love. But his life (and the story) is shaken up when his mother and father inform him that they have decided to move the family to Canada. Along with some of the animals, they set sail for their new home. If you have seen the trailer, or even the poster for this movie, it's not a spoiler to reveal that Pi ends up in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger. I imagine that's quite a selling point, as a lot of people would wonder how such a relationship could possibly work.

Director Ang Lee overcomes the limitations of such an enclosed setting in several spectacular ways. It's fascinating to see how Pi tries to survive, as well as co-existing with a dangerous carnivore. The visual aspects of the movie are of the highest quality, and I would be shocked if the movie wasn't nominated in several technical categories. The tiger is convincing, but the visual effects also shine when we are shown some of the things that can happen at sea.

I think Life of Pi is a movie that should be experienced without knowing too much of the story beforehand, so I am not going to reveal anything more about the plot. Although I will mention that the ending is open-ended and leaves you guessing about what really happened out on the ocean.

Religion is an ever-present theme. The movie will ask you to think about why the events in our lives happen, and whether they are random or part of God's plan. But more than one religion is mentioned, and it's not done in an overbearing way.

The script is well-written, and is a big reason why the story works. There is quite a bit of humor, but it's smart and feels natural.

I'm not sure how many movies I have seen this year, but this is one of the best. The story feels fresh and unusual, and some of it is profound and moving. I should also say that a few of the animals are hurt or even killed, so be warned if you are sensitive to such things. That said, you would see more brutality on a nature documentary like Planet Earth.

Life of Pi grabbed my attention early and held it for two hours. It's more than special effects, with the screenplay and acting both standing out. I highly recommend it.

Overall score 4.5/5",1357344000,13,3343,4.351524879614767
4814546,4,B005LAIII0,"A 2001 novel of the same name by Yann Martel is the basis for ""Life of Pi"" and it has been called unfilmable. The movie has been in the works since 2003, but the nature of the film has caused many to think that it would never be possible. See, most of the film involves a boy in a lifeboat with an adult Bengal Tiger. The movie also involves many other challenging things to portray, including a massive shipwreck, an island of meerkats and a strong religious overtone that manages to be fair to all religions. Suraj Sharma plays Pi Patel, a boy becoming a man who challenges all conventional thinking as he leads his life. Curious about religion and religions, he prides himself in knowing not just one god, but all gods. Not to mention, despite its obvious carnivorous nature, he has faith that a Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker has a soul and can be befriended.

""Life of Pi"" has many levels and as visually stimulating as it is, it is also mentally stimulating and beautiful in its intent. I'm not completely sure it achieved all that it intended but the gist of its message comes across loud and clear. Life is a gift and the days ahead are not guaranteed. Faith is vital in living a rewarding life and in knowing how life is not only to be lived, but to be cherished for each and every moment. I'm pretty sure that was the gist.

Above all, ""Life of Pi"" is not just a well-filmed movie, but a gloriously well filmed film. The quality levels of the filming are unprecedented and its 3D makes all 3D that has been done prior look like the second and third-rate stuff that it is. The effects used to bring the tiger Richard Parker to life are awe-inspiring. Your eyes widen, as they should, when Parker strikes and when he nears. There has certainly never before been a movie that gives you the impression of what it would be like to be and live in the proximity of such a beast.

""Life of Pi"" comes off a little heavy-handed at time and I have to admit that I assumed there would be more to it, but the amount there is to it is in the eye of the beholder. You can look at the movie and say that it wasn't about much, or you can look at the movie and say that it was about everything, because it is. The performances are outstanding, including the Tiger, and the film is without question, one of the best of 2012.",1357171200,17,2318,4.299771167048055

4814548,5,B005LAIII0,"I'm one of the few people that couldn't get into the book this movie is adapted from. Try as I might, I thought it moved extremely slow and it had a hard time holding my attention. With this in mind, I went into the theater for the film expecting to feel the same way when it was over. Suffice to say, at the end of the movie I felt emotionally rewarded and thoroughly entertained.

In fact, it was one of the most visually pleasing films I've seen in a while and I was very impressed with the cast. A lot of credit has to be given to newcomer Suraj Sharma as the title character, who brings a lot of passion and emotion to the screen. His performance was top notch and I look forward to seeing him in future roles. I was also impressed with Irfan Khan who plays the adult version of Pi, whose role in the film is the retelling of his story to a novelist. Equally impressive was Ang Lee's direction of the film. Many critics described ""Life of Pi"" as the ""unfilmable"" book but Lee does a magnificent job with the task and doesn't waste any opportunities to wow the audience with breathtaking visuals.

This movie more than exceeded my expectations. If you enjoyed the book, you're sure to enjoy the movie. If you're like me and you just couldn't enjoy the book, give the movie a shot.

4814549,5,B005LAIII0,"This film is a marvellous adventure that is not done for little children who will get frightened but for children closer to 77 than to 7 years of age. But it is such a beautiful story that adults might like it too.

Frightening like hell not on earth but on the Pacific Ocean. A shipwreck that sinks a cargo boat with only one survivor, a teenager hardly able to use a razor to shave and three animals from his father's zoo, animals that were being taken away to Canada to be sold: a Bengali tiger, a zebra and a hyena. The hyena is ignominious and it attacks the zebra on the lifeboat without even hesitating. The tiger is another story and the teenager is still another novel all by himself.

But when you want to survive and you have in you the god that supports you, not a god with a trunk as long as a nose, or vice versa, not a god that dies on the cross for others, not a god that is hermaphrodite according to your capricious desires. Not at all. A god that is powerful in your soul, inspiring in your spirit, supportive in your mind and absolutely logical in your brain. Then you have the force with you and you can stand up against a Bengali tiger and tame it, and you can stamp your feet against the elements and organize your survival and that of ""your"" tiger.

Then you have the mysterious island of Doctor Moreau, a carnivorous island that is also slightly cannibalistic. It is all sweet and nice in the day time but it turns flesh voracious at night. Can you imagine a tender teenager with no hairs on his face and a Bengali tiger: that's what I would call a meat ravenous predator's delicatessen treat.

What is surprising but not so much if you know animals slightly is the tiger's taming. A wild animal will accept in some extreme conditions to be tamed when it feels you are the one who is going to help it survive if it lets you survive. Animals are intelligent and in extreme conditions they know their interest. I was told that many times in Sri Lanka where I used to walk in the jungle. I was told that if on your way a lion, a wild cat or an elephant comes to cross it towards its own destination, don't run, don't scream, don't make any brusque movement. The animal knew you were coming a long time before you ever knew it was there. If you don't block its way, if you do not produce the mammal hormone of fear that stinks like hell, if you look at the animal straight in the eyes and at the most slowly step back without getting your eyes away from its nor turning you back onto it, the animal will not attack you, and in fact most of the time the animal will avoid you and you will never see it though you might walk a few yards away from it.

Animals are intelligent and they are not necessarily man's predators, even Bengali tigers.

But when the animal will no longer need Pi it will just walk away back into its own animal life without even looking back. A wild animal can be tamed but it will never be the pet of a human being.

The second lesson is that the insurance company of the ship does not accept that strange story with a tamed tiger and a carnivorous island, but it accepts quite well the story of four survivors with the odious cook who eats a rat, cuts up a sailor to catch fish, kills the mother of the hero and is killed by the hero himself. That sounds absurd in a way but human beings prefer a gross and totally inhuman story to a marvellous story about a wild animal that accepts to be tamed to survive and then walks away.

The last idea or rather warning is that if some of you are secular minded to the point of negating any possible divinity or superior being or even superior force, don't go. This film is not about the gods we know in any religion but about the god that lives in your skull and animates you so strongly that it makes you able to survive in numerous situations without being a monster and using your fellow traveller as bait for sharks. Even if that fellow traveller is a wild Bengali tiger you have to tame it first. In fact if that god, like Jesus, you have him in your mind, brain, soul, spirit or whatever, dying on the cross becomes like an easy mission that you will not even try to evade or suspend or escape from.

Too bad for those who consider any religious or mystic belief is an alienation and a fairy tale for dummies, because I know so many people who are beautiful for others and empathetic for any suffering just because in them they have the gem of that transcendence.

Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0

Is 'Life of Pi' meant as a story of great spiritual uplift--or a different story altogether--something more morose and sinister? Director Ang Lee, proffers up a twist ending where the film's protagonist, the young Pi Patel, has his amazing tale of survival called into question and replaced by an equally fantastic tale, albeit far less spiritually uplifting, than the first.

The film begins with a now grown Patel, residing in Canada and working as a professor. Patel's relates his life to an aspiring writer in three parts: 1) his childhood and adolescence with his family in India; 2) his life as a castaway in a lifeboat with the tiger, 'Richard Parker'; and 3) the climax of his survivor story which includes an alternative story to the one he's just related. Unfortunately, Lee must rely on a narrator, the elder Patel, to tell a good part of the story. This is off-putting (particularly during the denouement), since the stodgy conversations between the professor and the writer, can't hold a candle to the magnificent visual scenes established with the younger Pi (played by brilliant newcomer, Suraj Sharma) as he fights for survival on the high seas.

The first third of the 'Life of Pi' is slow-moving. Pi's upbringing is quite unusual in one respect: his father owns a zoo. Otherwise Pi is presented as a sensitive but quirky kid who evinces a spiritual side, even at an early age. Pi's spirituality comes into play later, when his alternative story, presents him in a decidedly less pacifistic light.

Perhaps the most significant scene in the first third of the movie is when Pi's father forces him to watch Richard Parker devour a goat. Pi's 'loss of innocence' foreshadows his ultimate test, when he later comes face to face with Richard Parker in the boat. How does the tiger manage to pull the goat into his side of the cell? The apparent unrealistic and perplexing scene may suggest, on the other hand, that Patel's story is either whole or part fantasy.

The meat and potatoes of the 'Life of Pi' is the young man's incredible story of survival after his parents are killed, during the sinking of the Japanese freighter. 'Life of Pi' fascinates, when we see how Pi manages to cope with a tiger in his lifeboat. Before Richard Parker becomes the center of Pi's attention, two other animals, a zebra and orangutan are killed by an hyena, who in turn is killed by Richard Parker. The animals' demise takes on a symbolic meaning later on, when Pi proffers up the second story in the Third Act. The sudden disappearance of the three animals from the boat, once again suggests that perhaps Pi's story belongs in the realm of fantasy.

Ang Lee proves his mastery as a director of special effects, since most of the tiger sequences were created through the wizardry of computer generated images. From his inventiveness to creating a small raft of flotation devices to keep a safe distance from the tiger and the way in which he goes about finding food after a whale destroys his food stocks, the story of Pi and Richard Parker proves quite absorbing. The taming of the tiger is the high point of Pi's 'man versus nature' saga before the Second Act crisis.

The crisis occurs when Pi lands on the 'bionic' island. Again, the island appears to symbolize Pi's crisis in the alternative reality the elder Pi relates to the writer in the Third Act. Once Pi discovers that the island's water turns acidic at night and is devouring fish, as well as a tooth in a carnivorous plant, he concludes that he'll die if he remains on the island.

The elder Patel finally reveals that his castaway story might merely be a 'coping mechanism'. Patel reveals that he told Japanese investigators of the possibility that what 'might' have happened was that he ended up in a lifeboat with his mother, a sailor with a broken leg and a crew member who his father had a disagreeable encounter earlier on, before the freighter sunk. The crew member ends up killing the sailor and his mother after his mother puts him on a raft. Patel returns to kill the crew member. The fight with the crew member recalls the tooth he finds in the plant on the island. Leaving the island might be symbolic of his decision to leave the situation where he found himself observing how his mother was thrown to the sharks. And finally, when Richard Parker fails to turn back and acknowledge him, this jarring event symbolizes Pi's acceptance of a loss of innocence and the reality that Story #1 was a fantasy.

There are hints that Story #2 may have been worse than Pi initially lets on. Was Pi possibly guilty of cannibalism? It's interesting that there was an actual Richard Parker in the 19th century who was a victim of cannibalism after a shipwreck and the character's name also figures in an Edgar Allan Poe novel, again a victim of cannibalism at sea.

Ang Lee, as well as author Martel, have made it clear that they both prefer Pi's spiritually uplifting tale of survival to the downbeat one involving murder. The elder Patel makes his preference clear in the film itself. The second story appears to be thrown in to contrast it with the uplifting message of Story #1. Story #2 then perhaps becomes a cautionary tale--similar to the loss of innocence moment when Richard Parker kills the goat. Lee has no problem with such ambiguity as long as the feel good message is highlighted.

We watched it with our eight-year-old who also enjoyed the visual splendor of the movie. It is a great film because it combines the best of two worlds - excellent movie-making, thanks to Ang Lee's masterful direction, and a compelling storyline.

The cast is another revelation. I was happy to see some of my favorite South Asian Indie actors such as Irrfan Khan and Tabu in this production. Irrfan Khan has been in other productions such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Namesake/dp/B0011Y13YG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Namesake</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slumdog-Millionaire/dp/B001UEBHYS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slumdog Millionaire</a>.Khan plays the adult Pi who is visited by a novelist referred by Mama-ji, Pi's uncle. Mama-ji believes Pi's life story is worthy of being novelized and so begins the story, narrated by the adult Pi.

The child Pi is played by Ayush Tandon whose full name, Piscine Molitor Patel, opens him to incessant teasing by his fellow classmates. Nevertheless, Pi's natural intelligence and curiosity thrives and he is particularly interested in the idea of God - who or what is God, and where can God be found? There are some interesting, even comical scenes of the young Pi shown practicing the various religions he learns about - Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam. Yet instead of scolding him, his wise father cautions Pi, and advises him to always approach things by way of reason.

Suraj Sharma portrays the 16-year-old Pi who is shown to be still in search of answers pertaining to the fundamental questions in life. Pi's chance to ""find God"" comes when he is shipwrecked on a lifeboat together with an adult Bengal tiger. The question is: Is this reality or is it Pi's imagination working on overdrive?

The movie unfolds with such grace and beauty that it literally took my breath away. Questions of faith and survival under the most trying circumstances are explored with such depth and Lee's assured direction brings out the best in his cast, especially the young Suraj Sharma who is simply amazing in this film. His performance is raw and visceral, and some of the most compelling scenes in the film are in his interactions with the adult Bengal tiger. Though the tiger is part of CGI, Richard Parker (the tiger's name) was very real to me, and the chemistry between Pi and Richard Parker was very credible.

This is one of the most unique films I have watched in a long time and I love it for so many reasons - it brought the novel alive for me and exceeded my expectations, it showed me that good storytelling does not have to suffer in a film loaded with CGI, and that an unknown actor can still carry a movie!",1356480000,16,3011,5.508658008658009

4814588,4,B005LAIII0,"Everybody has their own version of the truth, and the way we frame our own stories may have a great deal to do with a higher level of consciousness for which we all strive. Such is the gist of Yann Martel's 2001 bestseller which is the basis of this visually stunning 2012 adventure drama helmed by Ang Lee (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brokeback-Mountain/dp/B000ICXQS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brokeback Mountain</a>). I read the book several years ago and remember thinking it would make a great animated film by someone as creative as Hayao Miyazaki (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Howl-s-Moving-Castle/dp/B000CDGVOE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Howl's Moving Castle</a>). CGI, however, has evolved so dramatically in the past decade that the story can be now inhabited by real actors and awash in gorgeous abstraction that melds the fantastical with the intimate quite seamlessly. Shot mostly in a giant tank in Taiwan as well as on location in India, this movie is a unique example of how technology's endless possibilities can well serve an allegorical story focused on human survival and our own individual coping mechanisms.

Adapted by David Magee (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Finding-Neverland/dp/B006S009IY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Finding Neverland</a>), the story is framed by an interview in Montreal between a Canadian writer, a fictionalized version of Martel, and an unassuming middle-aged man named Pi. The first part of the film is a flashback set in a family-run zoo in Pondicherry, a bucolic former French colony in southern India. The central protagonist is Pi as a child whose sternly sensible father runs the zoo. We learn the origins of Pi's unusual name as it relates to an impossibly pristine pool in which his uncle swam in Paris. At once, you get a sense of the importance of both water and mathematics in Pi's early life as well as his unfiltered concept of religion. In Pi's fertile mind, which religion is a moot point as he adopts Hinduism, Christianity and Islam concurrently and despite his family's resistance. A life-endangering confrontation with a Bengal tiger under their care proves to be a turning point for Pi as he is warned by his supportive family to stay away from it. Later economic hardship prompts his father to decide to move to Canada where he plans to sell the animals.

The stormy journey by freighter turns tragic around the Mariana Trench where the now-teenaged Pi finds himself on a lifeboat with an unlikely menagerie in tow. The party eventually dwindles down to two, and this is where Lee imbues the film with a surreal spirit befitting the tale as we watch the seemingly incredulous situation of Pi co-existing on the lifeboat with the same tiger we saw in his childhood encounter. Dubbed Richard Parker due to a previous mix-up in paperwork, the tiger is integral to a series of eye-catching episodes that involves flying fish pelting them with force, a plethora of glowing jellyfish at night, a breaching whale nearly capsizing the boat, a disastrous storm that carries them to the brink, and a bizarrely florid island overrun with carnivorous plants and curious meerkats. None of these episodes will surprise readers of the book, but the execution is enthralling thanks to the masterful work of Chilean cinematographer Claudio Miranda (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Curious-Case-Of-Benjamin-Button/dp/B002C4YYEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button</a>) and the visual effects generated by the Rhythm & Hues Studios.

My one complaint about the film comes toward the end when things are spelled out a bit too deliberately considering how symbolic the story has been expressed up to that point. Pi is played by four actors depicting the character at different ages. Suraj Sharma effectively portrays Pi during the challenging lifeboat sequence and obviously makes the strongest impression, but Gautam Belur and Ayush Tandon are also affecting in conveying Pi's evolving psyche during his tender childhood years.

4814589,5,B005LAIII0,"The most amazing 3D quality movie that shows underwater footage and sea life. Life of Pi is base on a popular book by Yann Martel's novel that sold over 7 million copies. It's about a boy name Piscine Patel known as Pi (Suraj Sharma). He has a good life growing up in his father's zoo in Pondicherry, a French colony. Due to hard times, they have to close down the zoo and move some of the animals to Canada with them. The move to Canada is in a big Japanese cargo ship and all the animals are at the bottom of the ship.

A big storm hits the ship and sinks it. The survivors are Pi, a tiger (Richard Parker), zebra, hyena, orangutan and a rat. They are all in a small life boat from the cargo ship. After several days, the only two survivors are Pi and Richard Parker. They were afraid of each other but need each other to survive.

There are so many scenes with great cinema-photography. The most memorable ones are the underwater footage and the sinking of the cargo ship is so real and clear. The 3D brings out the glowing of the jelly fish and the blue wale vividly. Special effects of the tiger is the best part. It seems so real, I thought that the tiger is actually in the boat with Pi. The part I did not like is when the animals were fighting each other. It's too hard to watch the survival of the fittest.

The acting in this movie is so great. Suraj show a lot of emotions with his eyes and he stays in character and the audience can feel his emotions. It's so amazing to see his weight loss as the days go by at sea. My favorite character is Richard Parker. He helps Pi survive the shipwreck and at times he seems more human than creature. The lesson in this movie is anything is possible. Pi survives over seven months in the Pacific Ocean with just faith and Richard Parker.
I rank this movie 4 out of 5 stars. I give this age range 8 and up. Cheyenne N, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

This is truly an amazing story, with a great adventure that is hard to believe. Pi, (Suraj Sharma) an Indian boy, is on a ship with his family who is moving to Canada. One night there is a terrible storm that sinks the ship and only Pi, a Hyena, Zebra, Orangutan and a Bengal Tiger whose name is Richard Parker survive. They are all in one of the small life boats trying to stay alive. After a while it only becomes Pi and Richard Parker who are adrift in the Pacific Ocean. Pi is now trying to survive, but is in fear of Richard Parker.

Based on the best-selling novel by Yann Martel, this adventure is created in 3D and is one of my new favorites. The visual effects are amazing and capture the marine life really well with all its beautiful colors. I like the way this film is set up like someone is telling it as a story, this really keeps my attention. One of my favorite scenes is when a big whale comes out of the ocean; it is so big and pretty to see. It is incredible. I also like the way we learn how the Tiger is named Richard Parker. It is somewhat funny and unusual.

I would love to know How Director, Ang Lee, directs all the animals in this film, it is truly amazing how they act. David Magee, (Screenplay writer) is doing a remarkable job on transforming a great novel into an amazing script. Other casts in Life of Pi include Vibish Sivakumar (Ravi Patel) and Rafe Spall (The Writer).

A big message I found is to never lose hope no matter where you are in life. Pi is in the middle of the ocean for many many days with a big storm, and a Tiger, but through it all he never loses hope to be rescued. I recommend this film for ages 8 to adults. Younger ages may be a little frightened when they see some of the animal scenes, but other than that, this is a must see. You can enjoy it with your family and friends. I give Life of Pi 5 out of 5 stars. I love the message and the visual effects. This is a great story of hope and determination.

4814590,5,B005LAIII0,"This may be the hardest movie review I've ever written, somehow words don't
express it quite right ...

To begin, I saw Life of Pi in 3-D. A week later I went back and saw it again,
because I don't foresee having another chance. I expect the color and detail
will remain gorgeous in 2-D, and I definitely intend to buy the disc.

However the 3-D in this movie is spectacular. The tiger, Richard Parker, is
at the top of the list, but in fact the entire movie benefits tremendously
from 3-D. If you liked Avatar, you probably liked the marvelous animals.
And I'm sure in some scenes, Richard Parker is CGI'd to some extent. But
Life of Pi has a real earthly animal to work with, and you can argue there
is no animal on earth more beautiful or fierce than a tiger. That's part
of the genius of this movie, and I'm sure one reason James Cameron liked
it so much.

That brings me to another point about this movie, its suitability for kids.
Hopefully by now you understand the tiger is not a cuddly pet. Its very much
a wild animal, just like you can see in nature videos. Except in this movie
the tiger is a lot closer. He wants to eat Pi. Pi can't always see the tiger.
The audience knows the tiger is going to try something, but that just makes it
all the more nerve-wracking. Or exciting, depending on the person watching.
This movie made me jump several times, and I was often clutching the arms of
my chair. Its pretty intense in places. More so the second time I saw it.
I kid you not.

""Tiger, tiger, burning bright
In the darkness of the night""
  - William Blake

""Tell me what you see""
  - Pi

Regarding the story, I will say the movie starts out to establish what kind
of a kid Pi was when he was growing up in India. This helps us know Pi as a
multi-dimensional character. But the beauty of this part of the movie is
the kind you can see every day, not the visionary beauty that comes later.
Maybe it takes more effort to see it, because its a little too much like our
own lives when we were kids. Growing up can seem mundane. But sometimes
it can also be dangerous. Or heartbreaking.

Once the movie shifts to the ocean, its very easy to believe that now we
have our arms around the story. But Life of Pi is one of those movies where
we don't really know the story at all, until the last word of dialog has
been spoken. There's more than one story here, and most of what makes you
think, after its over, comes at the very end. You have to pay attention to
pick it all up. On disc, you may want to re-play a few seconds at the end
of the movie.

Its worth it. If you like to think about a movie, if you have a vivid memory
for beauty, then Life of Pi is one of the easiest movies to recommend. Its the
second masterpiece of 2012.",1355270400,267,2737,4.143396226415095
4814591,4,B005LAIII0,"Ang Lee is a director drawn to projects because of their narrative and their potential beauty. I can't think of a film he has made that was dull to look at or uninteresting. Even ""Brokeback Mountain"" is beautiful to watch, something that could potentially detract from the overall narrative. But in Lee's hands, he brings both together in harmonious symphony. Now, with his latest film, an adaptation of the popular bestseller ""The Life of Pi"", he adds 3-D to the mix.

I know it seems like every other film is released in 3-D now. After the success of ""Avatar"", studios are anxious to collect the extra $3 per ticket so even films that were not shot in 3-D are being retrofitted and released (or re-released) in 3-D.  I have yet to see one of these `retrofitted' films that truly use the magic of 3-D to enhance the viewing experience. Because they don't work, these unsuccessful films seem like a desperate money grab and only serve to leave a bad taste in the mouth.

And because they are so eager for that extra $3, they make a lot of films in 3-D. For a while, every one of these films was deemed a huge success, but now the novelty has worn off and there have been a few 3-D flops, leading some chains to devote one theater per location to both 2-D and 3-D presentations of the same film, alternating the formats. Not a good development. There are still major blockbusters, the tentpoles the studios want and need to earn a billion dollars to prop up the rest of their releases. So every superhero film, pretty much all animation, most action and horror films, even a few comedies and dramas reach 3-D screens. Comedies and dramas? Why, so we can see the requisite scene of a character vomiting in 3-D? It isn't necessary for a lot of these films to be in 3-D. It simply doesn't add anything to the experience.

Of course, there have been exceptions. ""Life of Pi"" is such an exception. Lee uses 3-D to add another visual layer, another texture to this almost fable-like film. He integrates the technique into the fabric of the story, making it a character. It is a pretty remarkable achievement.

He also uses 3-D as an effective technique when composing the shots. As Pi relates the story of his uncle, a well-known swimmer, we watch as he enters a pristine public pool in France. A woman wearing a stylish sun hat sits in the foreground before Lee pulls the camera back to reveal the amazingly beautiful pool. Because of the time period, the storytelling nature and the art deco look of the public facility, we instantly become transported into the story.

Early in the film, the adult Pi is telling his story to a writer (presumably Yann Martel, the writer of the book) and the scene dissolves to a shot of Pi's uncle swimming through a pool. The actor playing the adult Pi remains in the frame as the other character swims across the field of vision before we dissolve to the shot of the swimmer. I'm probably not doing this scene justice with my description, but the way Lee composes the shots, and uses 3-D to transition between them, really enhances the viewing experience and helps to build the tall-tale nature of the story.

My only disappointment with the film is that Lee and his screenwriter David Magee (""Finding Neverland"", ""Miss Pettigrew Lives For a Day"") didn't take a little more license with the book. Generally, I find just the opposite in a book-to-film adaptation. Lee clearly respects Martel's original book (he has a reputation as a Writer's Director, adapting their work very methodically and carefully) and slavishly tries to adapt the entire tale to the screen for us to watch. Unfortunately, because Lee is so intent on delivering the whole book, he mars his overall film just slightly. In the book, Pi tells his story to a writer, beginning the narrative and popping back into the story whenever the writer needs some clarification. Lee has two actors playing Pi and the writer (Irfan Khan and Rafe Spall, respectively). The film opens in Pi's apartment in Montreal as he is preparing a vegetarian lunch for his guest. He starts telling his story and we watch as he cuts vegetables and prepares the meal. Later, when we revisit them, they have gone on a walk and spend some time in a park, watching the river, as Pi continues the story. Later, they return to his apartment as Pi finishes the story. We spend far too much time watching two people talk before the visual fades to images of what they are talking about. It just isn't necessary to see soooo much of this. These moments serve to draw us out of the narrative and visual, both of which Lee has done such a splendid job of creating. Why would we want to spend any time sitting in a non-descript apartment in Montreal watching two men discuss what we could be living through with the characters? In a book, this type of narrative device works better; as one of the characters is telling their story, you begin to imagine the visuals they are describing. It is also a much more seamless experience. But when you are watching a film, you want to see these descriptions played out. It is a little dull watching these two men sitting and talking, for so much of the film. When Lee tells the story in images, it is a truly memorable experience. When he spends so much time with the actors telling a story, it is less interesting.

The visual part of the story is simply mesmerizing.  Once Pi and his family board the freighter with all of their animals, you know what will happen. Pi will eventually end up on a lifeboat with a tiger the family has named Richard Parker. While the story may be simplistic, Lee uses the visual quality of the setting to bring an almost ethereal quality to the film.

As the two survivors battle each other, the elements and some truly spectacular unexpected elements, a story evolves and draws you into this unique universe.

In the hands of a less accomplished director, spending a significant amount of film time with two characters, only one of which speaks English, could be problematic. First of all, the one actor has a lot of time on his hands, and the focus is on him. Just the slightest misstep and his portrayal falls apart. It is difficult to hold the attention of the audience for that long, but Suraj Sharma, who plays Pi, does a really good job. He deals with his situation in a natural way, never giving up hope, always pushing forward, trying to survive. Of course, this also seems natural because of all of the history we have already witnessed for his character (for instance, Pi's intense interest in religion), but he does a very good job of making the character seem natural and real. Too often when an actor has too much time on their own, they start to act overly theatrical, as though they are on stage giving a soliloquy. This isn't a far stretch; stage monologues are very similar and most actors have probably performed at least a few. But a monologue in a film is more problematic and the equivalent of two characters talking about an event, rather than showing it. In ""Pi"", it is necessary to see these moments, because they give us insight into the character. And Sharma steers clear of histrionics, unless they are necessary to show us his frustration.

The CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) in ""Pi"" is a pretty remarkable achievement. On the one hand, CGI is used to create some of the animals and some of their interactions. The best compliment I can give is that it is difficult to tell when real animals are used and when the CGI takes over. Real animals were used at some point (a Tiger trainer is listed in the credits), but it is difficult to tell when the CGI begins. Richard Parker shares the most interactions with Pi and he becomes a character in the film; a huge, fearsome beast with feelings, needs and goals. You almost get to the point that you begin to understand what his roars mean.

The CGI is also used to create some of the most beautiful tableaus you may have ever seen in a film. At one point, Pi and the tiger are sitting in the lifeboat in a completely lifeless sea; their reflection cast on the still water makes it look like we are looking in a mirror. The sky is filled with orange, yellow, red, all of which are also reflected. Of course, the water is not always so serene and the CGI helps to bring the fearsome storms and strange sea creatures to life in an almost brilliant way.

Because most of the film is inhabited by two characters, in a limited space, the 3-D helps this space become more interesting and also gives us a better feeling of what this space is like, allowing us to get a feeling of what Pi and Richard Parker are going through. It also enhances the visual beauty of the film, making us feel as though we are in a second lifeboat watching the two interact.

Lee has fashioned a beautiful, fable-like film advancing the use of two technologies to bring an otherwise unfilmable story to life.",1355270400,10,8891,4.558547276142768
4814652,5,B005LAIII0,"I saw Life of Pi in cinemas in 3D, and WOW!

This is truly one of the most beautiful (visually and emotionally) movies of the year. Life of Pi almost equals The Hobbit in vivid, lush, gorgeous cinematography. Everything looks and feels magical! The CGI does nothing but accentuate the film. It accents the story and the human actors, without detracting of distracting from the film (Lucas...Cameron...I'm looking at you!)

Yes, the story is hugely dumbed down for the film. This is my only con. Lee cuts out at least 45% of the book, including several storm sequences, a fight between Richard Parker and a Mako shark, another castaway that Pi happens upon, numerous brilliant philosophical musings, and quite a bit off the ending.
If I had to choose between them, I would say I liked the book better. But it's impressive that Lee came as far as he did. I would NEVER have thought it possible to film Life of Pi, never!

But that is not to detract from the visual magic, the beautiful cinematography, the ground-breaking CGI, the stellar acting (Suraj Sharma, kudos to you. You have a career ahead of you!). I loved Life of Pi. I saw it twice, and turned around the second time to watch the audiences faces during the infamous ""jump scare"".

Strongest Recommendation for Life of Pi! 4.5 Stars!

This Movie Should NEVER, EVER have been rated PG
In the beginning I was excited to see this movie as were the two elementary children accompanying me.  The previews were exhilarating and quite interesting--a boy shipwrecked and training his tiger.

The cinematography was interesting and beautiful, but none of us were prepared for the blatant killing of an innocent goat by the tiger (father forcing his children to watch). The death of one's entire family is shocking to a child and then conveniently left out of the previews, there was more than just a tiger aboard the lifeboat with the life and death predicaments that created.

Although there was not a lot of blood and gore, a child can still figure out what is happening and that was scary enough, but the ending was shocking and deplorable for a very young person to hear and think about, let alone grasp the real meaning and implication of the narative by the young man in his hospital bed at the end.

By the time the movie was over, it had ruined a perfectly lovely evening and we all went home quite depressed and we had to try to explain the unthinkable to two lovely children.

Again this movie should NOT be rated PG and one should not have to rely on word-of-mouth to know not to bring a minor to a PG rated film.  There must be a better system so that if you look up a movie online there could be a checklist of the type of content a film contains (including horrifying life and death scenes that a child would have great difficulty with.

I was so looking forward to this movie but in the end it was just depressing.  Aside from the cinematography, I cannot recommend this movie even to an adult unless you enjoy depressing entertainment.",1355097600,30,1844,4.850318471337579

He selects what sounds good to him, or what is most helpful to him in coming to understand the world around him...both what he sees and what can't be seen.

Eventually, the family is forced by political upheavals to move the entire zoo enterprise to Canada.  But on the sea voyage across the Pacific, a terrible storm hits and the ship sinks.  Pi finds a lifeboat, but so do several zoo animals, including, most importantly, the Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker.  The bulk of the movie deals with Pi and Parker's LOOOONG sea voyage and how they survive a harsh environment, the wondrous things they see and the relationship they establish.

Lee has filmed this saga in 3D, and I recommend you see the film this way if you can.  The 3D is some of the most sparkling and dazzling since AVATAR.  While it's clear much of the film must be CGI, the CGI rarely shows.  In fact, it is nearly impossible to believe that the tiger wasn't flesh & blood much of the time.  It is rendered dazzlingly.  In fact, the whole movie sparkles in a way that creates a heightened reality (or, puts a touch of fantasy onto reality).  There's no question in my mind that from a technical perspective, LIFE OF PI is one of the best this year.

The story itself is undeniably gripping.  I liked that no sentimental relationship is developed between Pi and the tiger.  This animal is a killer.  It is wild and dangerous.  The two create an understanding, but there is never mutual affection.  It is not a story of anthropomorphism.  There are many utterly gripping scenes (the storm is particularly effective), a fair number of humorous moments and some scenes that are simply gorgeous to look at.  Even though the pace is somewhat deliberate at times, I was never bored.

But, as with the book, PI wants to be profound.  The narrator of the film (I won't say more about who that is) tells a listener, ""you will believe in God"" after hearing the story.  I not see how this story could make someone believe in God.  The ending essentially attempts to be a validation of the young Pi's early ideas about embracing what you want from various religions rather than needing to follows all the dictates of just one belief system.  While one could debate the merits of this argument (and the other argument the end of the film posits, which I won't hint at for fear of spoiling things)...there is NO emotional heft to them within the LIFE OF PI.  This was the huge failing of the book, which told such a splendid story, only to diffuse it all with poppycock pop spiritualism.  Lee, rightfully so, I suppose, has not changed this...but his film also collapses under the mundane nature of this films revelations.  (PI author Yann Martel's follow-up novel BEATRICE AND VIRGIL suffers the same bloated sense of self-importance, but is also unpleasant to read).

I know others find the insights of LIFE OF PI to be nearly miraculous.  I'm sorry, I just don't see it.  To me, this story has become one of those things we now teach in schools (my daughter had to read it in high school) because it SEEMS as though it has great literary import.  The fact is, it is 97% wonderful, but 3% utter navel-gazing.  That 3% can't completely destroy what has become before, but it sure left a bad taste in my mouth, both in book or cinematic form.  By all means, you should see it.  Ang Lee has done some of his best work here.  But take it for what it is, and not for what it pretends to be.",1355097600,6,3972,4.485355648535565
4814655,5,B005LAIII0,"Life of Pi gave me so much to think about. It is a stunning movie with great visuals, which I happened to see in 3D (It made it even more awesome). The scenes with just him and Richard Parker were absolutely amazing. During the movie I started to really like the Tiger. But as well as the visuals and story, the message was amazing.

In the beginning of the movie he is talking to a man who was told by Pi's friend that Pi could convince him to believe in God. He told an absolutely beautiful and intriguing story that was at the same time very sad. He lost his whole family at the beginning of the movie, and he was the only person who got to the boat alive. The four animals that survived were the hyena, monkey, and zebra. Those three all died. The hyena killed two of them and then the tiger, Richard Parker, came out from under the canvas covering part of the raft and killed the hyena. Pi jumped off the boat just in time as Richard Parker went for him. After this they survived together for many weeks, and lived through storms and many other dangerous sea experiences. Then the wierdest part was when he reached the island shaped like a sleeping person, which was made out of some mossy material and was completely floating in the water. It was covered by thousands of merecats, many of which Richard Parker ate. Pi began to get comfortable, but as soon as night came Richard Parker fled to the boat and the merecats into the trees. Pi went into the trees also, and slept. At one point either in the night or the morning he opened up a plant bud, in which was the tooth of another human being. He realized that even thought the island gave him rest, drink, and food, it was poisonous and he could not stay there. Also, the water pool which he had drunk from earlier had disintegrated the fish with some kind of acid. So he left with Richard Parker, and they continued their journey. He eventually reached the coast of mexico. Richard Parker fled into the woods without turning back, but he did stop for a moment before going into the forest. Pi cried for a long time. After telling this story to the listener, he told a second story which took about one to five minutes of the movie. In that story it was a gruesome tale of him, his mom, the cook, and a sailor on the boat. The Cook killed both the sailor(Zebra) and the monkey (Pi's mom). But then Richard Parker (The ferocious side of Pi in this version of the story), killed the cook. He survived by himself on a boat for many weeks/months before arriving in Mexico.

One way of interpreting the story is that Richard Parker and the animals were in fact just representations of people, and that he was just inventing this story to keep away the pain of what happened. But another interpretation is to take it literally. After saying these two stories he asked, ""Which story do you prefer"" and the person answered, ""The one with the Tiger"" And so that is sort of where it ended, leaving you with the question of which one is true. Logically the story that he told second is true, but the beautiful story that he spent a long time telling is the one that it seemed was more emotional for him. So in the end it left me contemplating these two and I still am.

But overall even with the confusing aspects of this movie, it left me with a great message. At one point near the end he said, ""As is the way of God"" This sort of made me think that even though we have to suffer in this life, we can make it into something beautiful. So believing in God is giving you hope, something to believe in instead of nothing, and a way to keep sane.",1355097600,20,3592,4.294985250737463
4814656,4,B005LAIII0,"Castaway meets Planet Earth with a few pointed spiritual overtones thrown in for good measure. As the plot slowly develops, it takes the slant of a classical fantasy adventure, akin to the serial novels and comic strips of the early 20th century, granting the screen an entrancing, otherworldly sensibility. As is, that would've been a perfectly acceptable stylistic decision - after all, director Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon made no apologies for its less-grounded moments - but such stylish exaggerations actually become an essential part of the telling when an admission in the final act changes everything we'd just seen. Magnificently composed and spectacularly beautiful, it would be worth watching for the eye candy alone. Lee's restraint in this regard is especially impressive; he knows precisely when his audience will want to linger in a moment and indulges them with one breath-catching vista after another. Kudos to the enormous team of effects artists; their combined efforts have produced a cinematic masterpiece. A bit sluggish at times, with a few moments that tease the boundaries of plausibility, its visuals are a revelation and I'm still considering some of the story's underlying meanings a day later. Worth experiencing.",1354924800,9,1256,5.380710659898477
4814657,5,B005LAIII0,"I went into this movie not quite sure what I was getting (not having read the book), and came out not quite sure what I had gotten. That's not a criticism - a sense of wonder and something beyond appears all too seldom in mainstream movies.

Really, this can only be understood in its final moments. Moving forward, we see a young man desperate for something to believe in, taking a cafetria approach to Hinduism, Catholicism, and Islam, trying to feed his hungry soul from the smorgasbord. Then, the catastrophe at sea lands him in a life boat with a small managerie. Oddly, the different beasts appear at different times, despite the boat's small size and dubious hiding places. The largest part of the movie describes his uneasy standoff with Richard Parker, the only other survivor, as supplies run out and conditions worsen. Finally Pi (the protagonist) finds land, and is saved - and Richard Parker disappears. As the only survivor, he's the center of interest for insurance investigators trying to understand the wreck.

Under their merciless interrogation, Pi's story suddenly changes - and changes everything that had gone before. His deep and wide sense of belief falls into place, the whole time at sea takes new meaning, Richard Parker becomes both less and more than he'd been all along, and even his childhood feat of memorizing mathematical pi (3.14 etc) to hundreds of places earns a new understanding.

And, when everything in the story changes, perhaps the viewer changes too - I know I did.

I don't know how the book is since I've never read it but the film didn't seem to have a story and characters that are very compelling. Ang Lee and his screenwriter needs to receive some credit in turning this tale into a feature movie, however. A story about a boy on a boat with a tiger where nothing much really happens except basic survival is difficult to shoot but Lee seemed to do as nice a job as it is possible given that challenge. Seeing the 3D version of the film may be the only redeeming feature of the movie. The 3d adds a depth not only to the images but to the story telling as well. Its use to convey depth in space is incorporated nicely by Lee into giving sense of loss and loneliness the boy feels in the ocean with all these non human animals in the boat and in vast the ocean. So while beautiful, original in its uses of CGI technology and poetic, these are the only reasons to see it as the story was lackluster and the characters also a little dull.",1354579200,11,1042,4.163366336633663

Because he isn't, I am ultimately left at the end feeling like 'has he really learned anything?'

I recommend leaving the theater moments after Pi tells Richard Parker ""we are dying."" Because in the real world, more often than not, there are no hollywood endings - especially for bengal tigers.",1354492800,,713,4.796747967479675

4814732,4,B005LAIII0,"The film opens with a lengthy character build-up of Pi. It starts off with the crude explanation on how he got his name. It contrasts this with Pi's discovery of religion to the point of believing in universalism. His lofty ideas are quickly contrasted with a dose of reality when a tiger, he thinks he has connected with, eats a live goat. After he develops a love interest we finally come to the meat of the tale.

His family opts to go to Canada on a Japanese merchant ship and if everything went okay, you wouldn't see a picture of Pi in a boat with said tiger promoting this film. His life's experience are reflected in his relationship with the tiger and survival at sea.

Pi's life is one filled with contrasts. He is a microcosm of India and perhaps the world as his name is symbolic of the constant the defines circles, orbs, and globes. That is the spiritual aspect. However his name derives from the ""P"" word giving it a dose of crude reality. The film/book is designed to be a metaphor. This is demonstrated in the end when Pi gives us two stories, then asks, ""Which do you prefer?"" as a way to test one's views in a world of contrasts.

While the film is interesting on a number of levels, it is heavily narrated with an accent. This caused me to occasionally miss a word every now and then. Hopefully the DVD will have English subtitles.

Parental Guide: No sex or nudity. While rated PG I thought Pi dropped the F-bomb near the end when he was talking about the two Japanese investigators. It was tough to tell with the accent. Beginning of film frequently refers to pi**ing.",1354406400,2,1590,4.434931506849315
4814733,4,B005LAIII0,"""Life of Pi"" (2012 release; 126 min.) brings the story of an Indian boy, named Piscine Patel, nicknamed Pi, as he grows up with his family on a zoo in India. Because of falling fortunes, Pi's dad decides to move the family to Canada, taking the animals of the zoo with them on their cross-Pacific Ocean journey with the idea to sell the animals upon arrival. Then disaster strikes as the ship meets a mega-storm and sinks. Pi manages to get on a life-saver boat, only to find that several animals made it onto the boat as well, a hyena, a zebra, an orangutan and a bengal tiger. To tell you more of what happens after that would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to find out and experience it for yourself.

Several comments: the movie truly kicks into gear about 30 min. into it when the storm hits the ship transporting the family and the animals, with astounding visuals. The next hour of the movie finds Pi adrift on the Pacific Ocean with the several animals that somehow got onto the life-boat. At that point it reminded me of the Tom Hanks movie ""Castaway"" some years ago, albeit with one big exception: the visuals of the movie, in particularly when watching it in 3D as I did in the theatre today, are simply amazing. Eye-candy pure and simple. These days, 3D movies are rarely worth the bother, but this one is the beautiful exception, perhaps the best use of 3D since ""Avatar"".

A shout-out to Suraj Sharma as the 16 yr. old Pi, who brings an outstanding performance, in particular since the many scenes he does with the bengal tiger, who is entirely CGI (although amazingly and incredibly looking real life). Also a special note to also to Mychael Danna who scored the beautiful soundtrack for the movie (it is available on CD). In all, I thorougly enjoyed this movie from start to finish. I was amazed how quickly it rolled by. ""Life of Pi"" is one of those movies that needs to be seen on the big screen, and in 3D at that.

On the plus side, I liked that the movie was faithful to the book. The photography and special effects were breathtaking; director Ang Lee has created a dreamy, magical, and stunningly beautiful world. The CGI tiger was excellent; I couldn't tell when he was drawn and when he was real. The soundtrack is lovely.

On the down side, I found myself glancing at my watch at times, wondering when it would be over. The pace was too slow for me and I think it would have been an even better movie had 15 minutes been cut from it.

4814737,5,B005LAIII0,"Supposedly un-filmable, this fantastical tale of a teenager from India surviving at sea for weeks, alone but for a Bengal tiger is a remarkable piece of filmmaking.  The movie begins with an adult Piscine (Pi) Patel (Irfan Khan) relating a potential story for a book to be written by a friend of a friend (Rafe Spall).

He tells of him and his family leaving India and their zoo for Canada to start over.  They have crated up numerous animals for the long voyage on a Japanese cargo ship.  During a violent storm the ship sinks, but through some fortune, Pi (Suraj Sharma) has managed to land on a life boat along with an injured zebra, a disoriented Orangutan and an ornery Hyena.  Oh, and the tiger.

Now before you think this is one of those can't-we-all-just-get-along Disney movies - after all it is rated PG - forget about it.  One of the points driven home in the film is that these are animals and in fact, they do what animals do.  You get the picture.  Pi, realizing he isn't dealing with dogs and cats, uses the human brain and creates a makeshift raft which is tethered to the boat.  At certain times he is able to return to the boat for supplies and to check on the surviving tiger.

Their confrontations are certainly the meat of the film, but that really isn't enough.  I saw this in 3-D and it is certainly the best use of the technology since ""Avatar.""  Directed by Ang Lee, the use is never in-your-face trickery, but is created on film as a new, dare I say art form?  While this film may not be life changing, it is beautifully made, creative and wondrous.  There are enough questions to keep the mind busy for days to come.  Lee and screenwriter David Magee masterfully adapt Yann Martel's novel.  And just when you are trying to soak it all it, an alternate version of the story gets the mind reeling.

BLU RAY UPDATE (5-2-13):

This Oscar winner, including director Ang Lee, begged to be seen again.  It ranked as my 10th favorite film from last year and would likely move up if I would have a do over.  This time I saw it in 2-D and it holds up nearly as well as it did on the big screen in 3-D.  While there is no understating the technical achievement of the film, it is also filled with wonderful emotional moments and big chunks of humor.

For example, early in the story Pi relates how he became so interested in various religions.  He was a practicing Hindu as well as Christian and Muslim as a young teen.  Surprisingly this didn't seem to bother his parents.  In one exchange at the dinner table his father, Santosh (Adil Hussain), comments, ""3 more religions and you'll spend your whole life on holiday."" He then adds, ""Think rationally.""  The relationship Pi had with his father, including the respect for wild animals, is an important point in the story.

The Blu ray transfer has an aspect ratio of 1.85:1, with a couple exceptions, and has a 1080p resolution.  As you might expect there are virtually no blips in the carryover that I could see.  This is a colorful movie and all the hues and shadings come across perfectly.  The film was digitally shot and is crystal clear.  Chapped lips and sunburned tiger nose are easily seen.  There is a couple format changes to note.  In one scene with the flying fish, the aspect ratio changes to a wider 2.35:1.  In another, a shot from overhead as a whale glides by the boat is shown in windowbox (1.33:1?).  These are brief scenes and while noticeable, they are not distracting.

The audio is demo quality with a DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 track on full display.  There are scenes of quiet beauty (great musical score) and others of thunderous activity from all speakers.  An example is the violent ship sinking scene.  For some great sound effects, check out the tiger claws as he makes his way around and later into the boat.  This is a magnificent film paired with a superb transfer.  There are 3 documentaries involving the movie production as well as a photo gallery and some storyboards included in the extras.",1353888000,13,3993,4.5195530726256985

The acting is stunning and the visuals are beyond. I never read the book but for once I don't seem to regret it because the film was such a journey of sorts.

4814740,5,B005LAIII0,"I usually don't review movies.  I stick to books.  However, with The Life of Pi, I am choosing to make an exception.  It is so darn good and so close to the book that I feel it deserves a review that reflects how wonderful it is.

The Life of Pi is about and adult man named Pi who has a visitor in Canada who has met his uncle in India.  His uncle told the visitor that after speaking to Pi, he will believe in God.  Pi has a story to tell and he chooses to tell the story to the visitor who has the time to listen.

Years ago, Pi's parents owned a zoo in India that started going bankrupt.  They decided to sell the zoo but take the animals to Canada and perhaps make a fresh start there.  The animals and Pi's family are loaded on a cheap ship like a poor man's Noah's Ark.  The animals are all tranquilized and kept in the basement of the ship so they won't get seasick.  A storm occurs and Pi and everyone else on the ship go overboard.  Pi finds himself on a lifeboat with a tiger named Richard Parker, a post-natal orangutang, and an injured zebra.  Together they start a stupendous journey through the Pacific waters.

Most of the movie's renderings of Richard Parker were done by computer graphics and it's a mighty fine job they did.  We see how Pi and Richard Parker vie for space on the tiny boat and how, daily, Pi fears for his life as a tiger's meal.

The movies has some strong philosophical and theological issues that play out beautifully and it is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time.  I am very impressed at how close the movie is to the book.  Usually, I get very annoyed because movies and the books they are made from have very little in common.  Not so with The Life of Pi.  It is a beautiful book, a beautiful movie, and the two mesh together as one.

I recommend that everyone see this movie.  I saw it in 3-D and that was quite an experience.  However, I get migraines and the 3-D was a bit overboard (no pun intended) for me.  Someone told me that the actor who played the young Pacine had never acted before.  If so, he is a natural, and a wonder to boot.

There isn't a spare word in the movie, nor a spare scene.  It is beautiful, thoughtful, and we finish the movie asking ourselves whether God exists.",1353715200,7,2253,4.155092592592593
4814741,5,B005LAIII0,"Wonderful and magical. And breathtaking.

Unfortunately, I don't think it will do too well at the box office: the marketing for this movie has been so very atrocious I almost didn't watch it.

Despite what the previews and promo posters might suggest, it is not yet another derivation of the Jungle Book as a motion picture (not that there is anything wrong with the Jungle Book or any movies or animations it inspired) or some politically correct cultural lesson on things that are Indian.

What it is is a singular experience, and it is absolutely beautiful. I have been watching lots of movies ever since I was five years old, and I am having difficult time  coming up with another movie this captivating or visually stunning.

I should be a bit ashamed to admit that I have found the majority of Ang Lee's movies rather boring (due to my attention deficit syndrome), but Life of Pi is NOT at all boring. Not even a little bit.

I am an English teacher with an MA in English and Creative Writing, and I tell my students when I teach this novel that this is one of the few movie adaptations of literature that I can say I enjoy as much as reading the book - and I read/teach the book every year.

If you've not read the novel, and reading isn't your thing, please watch the movie.  Please watch the movie with an open mind.  There is SO much to take away from Pi's incredible journey - no matter where you are in life, or where your faith (or lack thereof) lies.

Okay, that was the English teacher in me typing.  Now to hear from the movie fan.

The visuals are stunning and enhance the storytelling superbly.  The acting is top notch.  My only complaint is the contrived romance between Pi and Aninji.  This is not a part of the novel and does nothing to enhance the movie.  The whole sequence should have been cut to make room for an expanded explanation of Pi's conversion to Islam - the one thematic element that is lacking in the film (which speaks volumes about Hollywood and American politics). On the whole, though, Ang Lee delivered a fine film that lives up to the vision of Martel as I understand it.",1528070400,,1293,4.345833333333333

8477806,5,B005LAIII0,"Superior film making. Soundtrack wasn't any better than you would get on DVD. Given content of movie, sound engineers for the Blu-Ray disc had a lot to work with, but they blew it. Didn't see the film in a movie house. But, the so-called DTS 7.1 audio on the Blu-Ray disc is a disappointment. It is surround sound, that's it.",1527465600,,325,4.433333333333334
