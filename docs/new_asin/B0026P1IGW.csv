Just Arthur and Merlin as they would have been when they were still young and trying to find themselves.  All in all an excellent Family TV show and worth every minute you watch it.  As a Medieval reenactor I enjoy very much the jousting and sword fights, but the intrigue as well as the fantasy (magic) should appeal to those seeking more.

 Well done BBC, maybe Hollywood can learn something from you!",1257552000,,546,4.42
8353301,4,B0026P1IGW,"I saw this aired on TV not expecting too much, but as I'm fond of fantasy, dragons and magic, thought it worth a try. The Arthurian legend is basically thrown into a blender, and comes out bearing little resemblance to the original, except for the names. Nevermind that Merlin, as an old wizard, teaches young Arthur (who doesn't know his heritage until much later)And Morgana, Arthur's half sister, is a witch, and Uther dies before Arthur meets him. And Gwen is a nobleman's daughter. And Camelot does not exist until Arthur builds it as a young king.
  I don't care. Throw out the expection of accuracy entirely and enjoy it. That's what I did. Now I'm hooked into watching every Sunday. I enjoy the acting, and really think Merlin is played by an actor worth watching. He is very engaging. Also, Arthur and Gwen are well played. I think this show will appeal to young people, and the young at heart.",1247270400,12,903,4.60248447204969
8353302,5,B0026P1IGW,"From the first episode, I was captured. This is a brilliant new series from BBC. It is for young and old. It is for those who like the fantasy stories with magic(sorcery), dragons, and the like. The characters that play Morgana, Gwen, Merlin and Arthur are so likable that you can't help but fall in love with the show. I also love that they characters are all British (as it is about King Arthur). It is a breath of fresh air in world of television. Something new and different. It is unique to television and very entertaining. It keeps you wanting more. A definite must see for anybody who likes the fantasy world, Robin Hood type of movies or the like.",1246752000,3,656,4.429752066115703
8353303,5,B0026P1IGW,"This is a really great series. The show is great in that it has really talented actors and actresses that are unknown. I agree that it was surprising to see a black Gwen. No offense, as she fits the role well, it was just unexpected.

I don't like the fact that there are only 13 episodes in the first season, but am glad to hear that there will be a Season 2 of Merlin. Hopefully, it will have more episodes and we will learn more about the characters.",1246579200,2,453,4.1477272727272725
