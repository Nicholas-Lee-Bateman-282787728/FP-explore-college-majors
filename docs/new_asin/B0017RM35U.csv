8266990,1,B0017RM35U,"Beware of this collection! I bought it for the famous ""Martian Visitor"" clip but the version contained here hacks off the ending where the saucer flies off from the drive-in, which ruined it. A waste of money in my eyes from a very arrogant producer with no customer service skills. Purchased directly from the producer's website, not Amazon.",1502064000,,342,4.913793103448276

8266992,3,B0017RM35U,"If you are looking for the original 10 minute clock that was shown at the drive-in's ... THIS IS NOT THE ONE!  The quality is excellent but I wish there was a good quality version where they don't take out the words ""DRIVE-IN"". Otherwise, this IS made from a good quality print.",1316131200,,278,4.346153846153846
8266993,2,B0017RM35U,"This DVD as delivered had a running time of 10 minutes, 16 seconds, even though it is advertised as 30 minutes long.

The picture quality is very good, but the sound levels go up and down in volume - not enough to truly annoy, but just enough to be noticeable(especially when the running time is only 10 minutes+).

For the cost plus shipping, this is a purchase selection only if you absolutely have to have it as a drive-in collector/completist.",1249603200,4,447,4.575
