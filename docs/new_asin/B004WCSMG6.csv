4486374,5,B004WCSMG6,"As a biofeedback therapist and learning strategies specialist I have come across many students who have test anxiety , math phobia, hyperactivity , stuttering. I always thought that school can make you sick. Then I saw this video and basically understood that school does make you sick. The competition, unfair amounts of homework etc. make students have anxieties at a young age leading to insomnia, stomach aches , anorexia, even severe depression , and the parents can only help by getting a tutor. thus taking the school out of the student and putting it somewhere else. If you feel that we have not just yet hit on what makes for a successful education where the USA can compete with other countries then have a look at this video.

4486384,4,B004WCSMG6,I watched this movie with interest. I think that movie is great. We do have a lot of homework for our kids which is absolutely unnecessary. All kids should learn at school not at home. All those countries which are ahead of us in testing don't have that much homework.  The whole educational system should be revise. But movie doesn't touch an issue that some kids have underlying learning disabilities and can't take the whole load. Also all those AP classes should be eliminated all together. All children should be able to learn on the same level. If a child is behind there is a problem somewhere which should be address.,1444089600,,625,4.63063063063063
4486385,5,B004WCSMG6,"Although I am giving this film 5 stars, I want to proceed this review by asserting that I did see some flaws in the argument that they were constructing, and I do not entirely agree with all of the contentions that are stated in this documentary.  Despite the places where it falls short, the valuable insight that (I hope) this movie will bring to the discussion of education and best teaching methods is gutsy, extremely well intentioned, gives voice to our children, and lets us know how we can all be part of the solution together.  This is the kind of documentary I long for precisely because it empowers the viewer by providing us with a vehicle for positive change.

I was an absolute skeptic when I began seeing that their main objective is to question how teachers assign homework to students.  When I look back on my own educational experience, I'm more than a bit disappointed that I didn't apply myself more to my homework.  For the past few years as a teacher, I've stressed homework as an essential part of my curriculum, especially because when I got to college the level of homework assigned was so intense I struggled to adapt.  Although I graduated with honors, I attribute the reason for my success in college to my dedication to the work I did outside the classroom.  Even now as a professional, I believe it is the work that I've ""self-assigned"" for my personal homework is the main reason I improved in my field.

However, this film repeatedly evaluates those ideals by measuring the impact that homework has on family values, children's personal health, and the normal biological development that children's brains go through.  As adults we do forget that the brain just like any other part of the body, needs the proper environment and nurturing if we want to maximize its potential.  Are we providing that through a constant adherence that you only get better by doing more?  The film points out inconsistencies that are hard to ignore.  For example,  they question if the homework that is being assigned truly helping our children's education or is it ""busy work"" that the teacher just handed out because they feel the need to consistently give work?  The psychologically damaging effects that can happen to students that struggle with homework (taking an hour when they're told it should only take 10 minutes) because there is this relentless push that you MUST meet these standards by this grade or you're ""failing.""  Worse, how the education system, alongside parents and teachers, stress that completing this work is essential to them becoming successful adults but the students are really receiving the message that the grade is important not the learning itself.

It also points to the severe gaps in our education that prevent children from developing into happy, successful adults because they aren't given time to develop other kinds of intelligence.  Adults often punish students for not doing their homework by taking their phones, removing them from sports or artistic pursuits, cutting into family time or even insisting that they forgo sleep, so that homework is completed consistently.  What I found interesting was the connection they made to student's obsession with social media and texting as a direct result of this isolating work that dissociates them from human interaction.  We want them to have healthy relationships growing up but then we do deprive them of experiences that would teach them how to foster interpersonal connections.  Additionally, there is this resentment from students about school because they don't feel good about the learning itself.  In the interviews with students, they agree with adults intentions on providing a solid foundation but are frustrated and hurt that if they show talent in art, drama, music their success isn't deemed to be as important as the grades, because that's ""extracurricular."" Ironically, we are taking from them these areas that build confidence in their learning capabilities.

Where it all began to click was the examination of AP courses.  Now I'm an AP teacher, and I do think that the sheer intensity of those tests and mandates on the curriculum do border on the absurd.  There is material on there that is so esoteric and dense that both students and teachers struggle to keep up.  Students who were high achievers candidly spoke about how they learned the only way to keep up was to sacrifice sleep and learn techniques to cheat.  I emotionally broke down at this point in the movie (so did the other teachers in the film) because I remember how hard I do see students trying, working, investing and many falling apart or withdrawing because the pressure is too much.  Often as a teacher you feel helpless because we are told to keep going, and going and going or you won't get through the curriculum which means we're a failure.

So have I stopped assigning homework?  No, but I have eased up tremendously.  Now, I do occasionally give no homework, and I give light assignments for the weekends because everyone deserves a bit of a break.  I also evaluate the assignment I'm giving for home.  If it won't be referenced in class or builds upon the lesson that day, I don't give it.  More importantly, I'm proactively asking how the homework assignments are going, giving time in class to begin their assignment so I can evaluate if it's appropriate for where they are, and be willing to adapt to what they need rather than bending to pressure about where they should be.

Maybe on paper my curriculum won't be as impressive as it was in the past.  I'm willing to sacrifice the approbation of adults if my students walk into my class feeling as if they are invested in their learning, see the value in my assignments and can master the skills I teach.",1443312000,13,5758,4.858751279426817

4486387,5,B004WCSMG6,"Actually, I couldn't finish watching this movie. It is so depressing and sad. It reminded me of how I had stomach aches every day before going to school - a very competitive private school - and stomach aches before going home every evening. Later, in college, I had migraines. Many of the kids in  this movie could be me as I was. This is a difficult movie to watch, but parents should be required by law to watch it. The damage they are doing to their children. Appalling. I gave the movie 5 stars, because it is so true. But it is not fun, enjoyable, lovable, pleasant or entertaining.",1441152000,3,588,4.394495412844036

4486392,2,B004WCSMG6,"The ""warrant"" for the price of this video corresponds with the unreasonable price of ""required"" textbooks for government run schools the average of which far exceeds the price of ANY book purchased elsewhere. Typical of progressive thought and ""learning""; just redefine everything (the term ""value"" for example) according to another alternative fantasy narrative so long as the agenda remains steadfast. Privatization of education remains the only solution which addresses the axiomatic inference that either everyone learns differently or that the ""old"" standardized modes are anachronistic. Universalized standardization works no longer in a culture that has rejected ... universals. By default (and this is a veritable axiom for those of us who still believe words were meant to have meaning) application of the ""one-size-fits-all"" core mission, pedagogy, and curricula, as far as the union-ruined public education system is concerned, is predicated upon only one reality - propaganda and control!",1393372800,,1000,5.763513513513513
4486393,5,B004WCSMG6,"Sorry that someone rated this so low because of the cost.
This is an excellent film about the truth in the american educational system and the intense pressure to ""get there"".
I saw this in my small town and watched several wonderful high school students walk out with their shoulders lowered, relaxed, relieved, not alone!
The best advice that I have heard from a high school college admissions counselor was on applications ""be the best you that you can be"" and you will find the college that fits you. It may not be ivy league or Cal or Stanford on the west coast but ""how many people (in the audience) are directly using the four year undergraduate education they received? Maybe someone raised their hand. This film addresses the issue of hoards of stressed out kids pressured to (maybe!) get admission space in the most coveted universities - and along the way learn how to take tests but not necessarily how to think critically.
I highly recommend this film.",1385856000,21,965,4.715976331360947
8444973,3,B004WCSMG6,"I resonated with the message but didn't feel like I learned much as I expected.

8444974,2,B004WCSMG6,"""Race To Nowhere"" makes some good points about our behemoth, dismal, and extraordinarily expensive education system.
But it carefully avoids any mention of the primary block to any reform of that system: the National Education Association, the largest and most powerful labor union in the United States. ""Race to Nowhere"" features nonstop evangelizing by education industry professionals, and constant reference to teen suicide, to persuade the public. Yet the NEA is never actually mentioned anywhere in the documentary, nor (of course) is there a single appearance of any critic of the NEA or the organized education industry.
This ""documentary"" is in fact poorly disguised (and somewhat crass) propaganda for those who control, and benefit from, working in the education system, the main problem with which is that it has been hijacked (along with billions of taxpayer dollars) to support the benefit of those who control it. Not surprisingly, the solutions proposed by ""Race to Nowhere"" are: 1. More money poured into the already failing system, 2. More political power for the education union and education industry special interest groups, and 3. the removal of all accountability for performance or results from anyone involved in the education system.
I have no problem with organized labor. And I sympathize with the challenges of educating our youth. But ""Race to Nowhere"" is glaringly biased and self-serving.",1527724800,,1420,5.37219730941704
8444975,3,B004WCSMG6,"I took note of who made this film (those involved in it) and where it was made. It was as I expected. A liberal point of view is always all or nothing. And that is never a productive answer. Homework is important reinforcement. Too much homework is just piling on. Don't throw out the baby with the bath water. Several of points that caught my eye. For one, the  bias against community college. What an elitist view that is being perpetrated on these kids.  Many kids start with community college because of the outrageous cost of 4 year universities, state and private. No one questions these prices and they go up and up. Kids and parents are beginning to figure out you don't have to sell the farm to go to college nor do you have to incur a lifetime of debt. Why pay 4 yr prices for the first two years which will be basically the same wherever you go? There are some wonderful community colleges. And not everyone is meant for college. Even some liberals need to just sell coffee at Starbucks or fix a car. While it's a nice thought, not everyone is going to be a doctor or even wants to be. The film was insightful with some elements like over scheduling and teaching to the test. But what I also saw was a bunch of liberals coming to grips with what they have wrought in public education. Learning is not the goal. Ticking off the box is all that matters. And instead of teaching the basics to everyone and letting the cream rise to the top they are making them all fit into an every evolving mold determined by whatever gov't agency has defined as the norm. Some of the people in this film were questioning their own liberal beliefs about education and didn't even realize it.  So in short, the best point was let your kids be kids and quit feeding them into the big $$$ liberal institutions unless you are going to call those institutions into account.  Let me recommend another film. Waiting for Superman.",1517011200,3,1915,4.431818181818182

8444977,5,B004WCSMG6,"I loved this very inspiring film. As I mentioned in my comment to a 3-star review, I am the web manager for a group of small private schools where we've followed essentially the same approach that Vicki Abeles advocates in this fine film. In our schools, we spend a huge amount of time on factors that, at first glance, would seem not to be related to academics. Yet our kids are routinely accepted at top-tier high schools and colleges. That's because an education that is highly individualized and focused on nurturing happy, enthusiastic children is FAR more efficient than the kind of lockstep, rigid ""no child left behind"" prison-like education that Abeles descries. When you take the time to ensure that each child can advance at his or her own pace and experience success repeatedly, the inevitable result is that they become highly enthused about learning. We recently self-published a book about our school - you can find it by searching Amazon for ""Head & Heart Beinhorn"" (including the co-author's name will ensure that you aren't presented with other titles called Head and Heart).",1495670400,,1093,4.945652173913044
8444978,4,B004WCSMG6,"Seeing this 6 years after it came out, but my oldest is just entering middle school so I had a better perspective for it. I would have liked it even better if the movie had taken time to focus on communities (other than Oakland) that were not so affluent, and where kids are obviously not enrolled in private school. What about middle class families living in a great district that send their kids to public school? Are the issues as endemic? It's hard for me to gauge whether I'm just seeing another version of, ""Same planet, different world,"" or if this is truly an issue across the country. Also, since time has passed, now we're wrestling with Common Core, and implementing our state tests. That part resonated with me the most because things have definitely not changed, and I've seen the pushing down of standards in just the 5+ years we've been part of the school system.",1483574400,,878,4.598726114649682
