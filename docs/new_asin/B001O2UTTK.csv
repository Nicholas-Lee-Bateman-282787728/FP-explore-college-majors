3726052,5,B001O2UTTK,"My son is 3 years and loves Scooby-Doo.  He would get a little scard while watching Scooby-Doo, so I got him A Pup Named Scooby-Doo seasons 1 through 4 DVD's.  I find that the monsters in these series are not as scary and we enjoys watching A Pup Named Scooby-Doo much more. As a reminder since these are season dvd's so if you monitor your kids TV time like I do, you may want to limit the amount of episodes they watch at a time.",1241827200,,431,4.0588235294117645
3726053,3,B001O2UTTK,"My 3 year old grandson loves this DVD. He watches it over and over. As the adult reviewing this product it is very poor quality. Very grainy images in a lot of the shows. It can be overlooked if your child loves A Pup Named Scooby Doo as much as my grandson does. He doesn't seem to notice the poor quality but then he does love that ""baby scooby doo"".",1240531200,2,352,4.042857142857143
3726054,5,B001O2UTTK,We have the first season so decided to purchase the rest of the seasons.  Its a wonderful show for the kids!! The kids find it very entertaining. Of course it helps that the adults don't mind it either.,1238025600,,202,4.315789473684211
3726055,5,B001O2UTTK,"This DVD set contains the second, third and fourth seasons of the late eighties early nineties series, A Pup Named Scooby-Doo. Shaggy, Scooby, Daphne, Velma and Freddy all star in this series similar to the original Scooby-Doo Where Are You? mystery format only as four children and a puppy solving Mysteries around Coolsville as the Scooby-Doo Detective Agency. The set contains the following 17 episodes:

14 Curse of the Collar
15 The Return of Commander Cool
16 The Spirit of Rock'n Roll
17 Chickenstein Lives!
18 Night of the Living Burger
19 The Computer Walks Among Us
20 Dog Gone Scooby
21 Terror, thy Name is Zombo (aka Roller Ghoster Ride!)
22 Night of the Boogey Biker
23 Dawn of the Spooky Shuttle Scare
24 Wrestle Maniacs
25 Horror of the Haunted Hairpiece
26 The Mayhem of the Moving Mollusk
27 The Ghost of Mrs Shusham
28 Cather on the Sly
29 The Wrath of Wait-Ro
30 The Weredog of Doo Manor

Remember these were made back in 89', the animation still looks great considering, and the characters are all molded more to the style and lingo of that era with a little sixties style thrown in as a callback to the original series. The set will also contain a bonus episode of Shaggy and Scooby Get A Clue called Party Arty.

If you're looking at this because you are a fan of the episodes or just like Scooby-Doo you will enjoy them and the price is certainly right. If you're looking at this for your children all I can say is I find it better and with more lessons to be found than the more recent Scooby-Doo series. I prefer this to Get A Clue or the later What's New Scooby-Doo.

I enjoy the episode theme's and find there is humor to be found in aspects such as a recurring character named Red Herring, who Freddy always claims to be the one responsible though he rarely ever was. Humor is there for adults who remember the earlier series and this show also does a great job expanding elements from that time, such as this series being set in Coolsville and frequently having the gang's detective agency reach out to help family member's or relatives as was a recurring theme in the original series. This series also gives us a closer look at the character's backrounds, immediate family members and gives nice explanation to how the Mystery Inc. gang got started in the mystery solving business.

Though my favorite will always be the original Scooby-Doo Where Are You? episodes that I grew up watching in syndication, I feel A Pup Named Scooby-Doo does a fine job in carrying on the legacy and making it accessible to preschool ages while still being fun enough for older children and enjoyable for anyone who loves Scooby-Doo. Amazing Price, seventeen episodes, interesting plotlines and many callbacks to the original series. I give this 5 stars for anyone who is a fan of Scooby-Doo and the gang.",1233187200,46,2816,4.601593625498008

3726116,4,B001O2UTTK,"This DVD is marketed all wrong! The third season, consisting of six episodes, was split into two seasons for this DVD set, and the episodes ""Night of the Boogey Biker/Dawn of the Spooky Shuttle Scare"" and ""Cather on the Sly/The Ghost of Mrs. Shushman/The Wrath of Waitro"" are counted as 5 separate episodes, when they are actually 2 full episodes, each consisting of 2 and 3 segments, respectively. I'm not sure why they split the third season, perhaps because half the episodes aired almost a year apart? Counting the episodes separately doesn't bother me as much. And I suppose counting this as 3 seasons isn't so bad either, considering they're together in this package anyway and they didn't try to sell them separately. Just thought I'd note that for all future buyers.",1409184000,17,774,4.871212121212121

I highly recommend A Pup Named Scooby Doo. My two boys love it as well. Plus- I remember watching it on Saturday morning cartoons so there is a nostalgic factor. Cheers!",1388880000,2,435,4.518987341772152

However, there are not that many episodes compared with the first season. I don't have time to look this up now and am only doing this because of an Amazon prompt, but FYI, these seasons are nowhere near as long as the first season so it's not the value you are hoping for.

They absolutely love the Pup Named Scooby Doo.  We've seen a few of the regular Scooby mysteries, but they think these are more fun because it takes place when the whole gang are still children.  There are a few spooky parts that my youngest did not like (the headless man in the haunted mansion) but overall this is a great series.  For all three seasons, I think it's a great price.

3726157,3,B001O2UTTK,"This is one of the funniest Scooby series to date. I enjoyed it years ago, and it's still funny today. It should get 5 stars from me now, except for the ""ghostly"" images I see onscreen. You see, Warner didn't take the time to remaster these, kind of like the old Scooby series. It had a lot of whiteness in it, adding an afterimage to some of the characters. Plus, the series itself is closed-captioned for the hearing impaired, but not the chase or theme songs. Kind of strange. If you can look past that, then the series is really fun to watch. It's nice to see where the Scooby-Doo Detective Agency got their start and how much the characters have changed over the years as you watch them today. What I would have liked to see is how they all met. That would be interesting. Give this series a try if you're a Scooby fan. You'll like it!",1243987200,7,840,4.289308176100629

So now as a parent of four (ages 11, 5, 3, 1) I get a great amount of joy sharing those cartoons with them.
