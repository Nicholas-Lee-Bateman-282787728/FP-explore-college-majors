I enjoyed the women more than the men.  They seemed to be doing more basic things, but then again, I could understand the flow of the match better because it was more on my own level as a beginner.  They aren't up there with Gracie, but they are still damn good and could wipe the floor with me.  It was pretty simple watching them - who's on top, who's got who's back, I could understand every move they made, while with the men I found myself mystified sometimes, what the hell are they trying to do?  The women's matches had consistent action too.

The one match I found the weakest, from a viewer's perspective, was the one where the two fighters didn't even go to the ground.  They just had their ""slap boxing"" contest.  During the fight I was shouting to the screen ""Let's go, do something!""  It seemed to me that they were both afraid to shoot, afraid they might lose a point.  While I was watching that borefest, I noticed that in the background there were some good jiu jitsu matches going on, but unfortunately the camera was focused on the wrong one.  Well, that's what the fast forward button is for.

There are a lot of matches on this video, and most of them are enjoyable to watch.  I also saw some interviews, done very amateurishly, sort of like if I asked my nephew to go interview somebody.  But that gives the person being interviewed a lot of room to be himself, if he wants to, as Matt Serra did.  His interview was more like ""Here, Matt, here's a microphone, do your thing.""  Matt has that big personality, as you can tell from Ultimate Fighter 4.

I'm wondering if Grappler's Quest may grow to rival Abu Dhabi some day.  Get the best in the world, pit them against each other in tournaments.  But without the blood and knockout punches, maybe America wouldn't support it financially enough to attract the Abu Dhabi contestants.  We don't have a prince here to put everybody up and make it worthwhile for the fighters.

I didn't always know who was who, who was winning, and I never knew what the score was.  An announcer would have fixed that, hopefully.",1157155200,,2216,4.498746867167919
8038444,5,B00064FYJW,"As the event promoter, I am proud that One of the Best events Grapplers Quest has ever hosted is now a full feature DVD.

The matches are breath taking and the interviews will have you laughing out loud, especially Matt Serra's and Rick Migliarese's interviews.  Serra even talks about grappling against Marcelo Garcia. CLASSIC footage...a must own.  Our next Beast of the East tournament will be in New York/New Jersey area in February 2005.",1097798400,4,442,4.945945945945946
