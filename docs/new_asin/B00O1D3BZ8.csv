6698623,3,B00O1D3BZ8,"Not one I'd watch again or give as a gift. I prefer more realistic story lines, so the idea of Carrie being an angel while in the coma didn't keep me as engaged as I hoped.  That being said, the restaurant owner guy really became very likeable (so did Carrie). Cute story that die-hard Hallmark fans will love; I'm still looking for one I like as much as The Christmas Card.",1480723200,2,374,4.267605633802817
