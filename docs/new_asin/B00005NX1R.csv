1637840,2,B00005NX1R,"Cactus Jack, Mick Foley, has never been known for his technical skills. I can count his moveset on one hand. Of course, he has made a name for himself with his extreme style of wrestling. Unfortunately, it might have been extreme in 94-96, during Cactus' years in ECW, but these days it is boring. When we have guys like Rob Van Dam, Sabu, Hayabusa, etc., seeing Mick Foley doing weak chair shots is not exciting. Seeing wimpy table spots is not entertaining, nor is watching people bleed. Unfortunately, that is what all of the matches on this DVD are made up of. If you are looking for good, ECW style wrestling, check out the Heatwave DVD. The RVD & Sabu vs. Hayabusa and Shinzaki match is more entertaining than this entire DVD. That beng said, the DVD is interesting. The promos are all good, and you get to see the very early years of ECW--in the first match, Joey Styles refers to te promotion as Eastern Championship Wrestling. There's a thin Paul E., Saturn with hair, and everyone looks very young. ECW's production values in those days were even worse than usual-even the ring looks terrible. The sound and picture of the matches is all bad. It gets 2.5 stars because its interesting to watch Mick Foley before he became famous, ECW's early days, and a few good spots. The DVD itself is put together quite well, and the editing and pacing of the compilation is well done. Its just the raw material itself was bad in the first place. I recommend this DVD only for big-time ECW or Mick Foley fans.",1009238400,,1506,4.540441176470588
1637841,5,B00005NX1R,This is just an awsome compalation of hardcore matches from the master; Cactus Jack. If you miss Foley pick this disc up and you'll have over three hours of matches and promos. Just an awsome DVD.,1008028800,,196,4.472222222222222
1637842,5,B00005NX1R,"Anyone who is a fan of Mick Foley, Cactus Jack, Mankind or Dude Love (although there are no Dude Love references at all on this DVD, thank God) must get this DVD. If just for the interviews alone, you will laugh your a.. off. But for the smarks out there, they make you think and it is sad, when you look at today's landscape of pro wrestling, and what Mick Foley has done to himself to contribute to this great sport, and what his consequences are today. This DVD shows only a small part of his ECW career, as he has wrestled in Memphis, Atlanta (WCW), and various independent promotions. BUY THIS DVD!!!!!!!!",1005782400,,610,4.407079646017699
1637843,5,B00005NX1R,"Long before he became a best-selling author and world famous WWF superstar, Mick Foley (Cactus Jack, Mankind, Dude Love) was independent wrestling's hardcore legend and his trek to superstardom led him through the ""hallowed"" halls of the ECW Arena.  This DVD chronicles Mick's two-year (1994-1996) stint as an Extreme warrior of ECW including his best matches and promos and his feuds with Sabu, Sandman, Terry Funk, the Public Enemy, Tommy Dreamer and Shane Douglas and his alliances with Mikey Whripwreck and Raven.  The DVD does not have any DVD special features, but in all seriousness, it doesn't really need any...
Here's a rundown of the DVD:
Your Host is Joey Styles
1. Opening Cactus Jack montage
2. Match 1:  Jack vs. Sabu (w/ Paul E and 911).  Brutal hardcore fight between the two hardcore legends.  Lots of tables, lots of high impact.  3 stars.  Shane Douglas, Mr. Hughes and the Bruise Brothers also appear.
3. Cactus Jack promo followed by a Paul E. promo
4. Clips of Mikey and Cactus beating Public Enemy for the tag belts.  Cactus and Mikey promo.
5. Match 2:  Cactus Jack and Mikey Whipwreck vs. the Public Enemy.  Crazy, arena-spanning brawl.  Lots of tables and a balcony dive.  4 stars.

7. The Cactus-Sandman/Funk feud:  Cactus promo (where Woman interrupts and Sandman attacks).  Match Highlights 1: Match between Cactus and the Sandman (Sandman gets KILLED).  Match Highlights 2:  Sandman jumps Cactus, Terry Funk helps Sandman and Shane Douglas makes the save.
8. Cactus Jack and Shane Douglas promo.  Match Highlights:  Cactus and Douglas vs. Sandman and Funk, featuring the flaming branding iron!!!

11. Match 4:  Barbed-Wire Match - Cactus Jack vs. the Sandman:  INSANE match with barbed-wire.  Slow start at first but it snowballs as the action goes on.  Lots of blood, lots of barb-wire, lots of caning, ALL HARDCORE.  5 stars.
12. The Cactus-Dreamer ""Anti-Hardcore"" feud.  Clips of Dreamer/Cactus vs. Raven/Stevie Richards.
13. Montage of Cactus Jacks Anti-Hardcore promos.  ONE OF THE DVD HIGHLIGHTS.  This is the collection of some of Foley's BEST promos ever.  Great footage of Mick at home for X-mas and at parks around the country cutting on the ECW fans and hardcore wrestling in general.  10 stars
14. Match 5:  Dreamer vs. Cactus and Raven.  Standard hardcore fare, tables, barbed- wire, etc.  3 stars.  Dreamer promo
15. Match 6:  Tommy Dreamer/Terry Funk vs. Cactus Jack/Raven:  All-out ""garbage-match"" hardcore war.  ALL kinds of plunder.  Everything gets used from dust pans to VCR.  Tazz and Richards also appear.  4 stars.

18. Mick Foley's Last ECW Appearance...Match 8:  Cactus Jack vs. Mikey Whipwreck.  Great athletic contest, solid spots.  4 stars.
19. Post-match: Cactus' Farewell Speech.  Replay of the Cactus Jack montage and an ending skit with the Blue Meanie and Stevie Richards.
Overall, this is an OUTSTANDING collection.  The pacing is ""just right"" on this.  A lot of the matches are clipped and only highlights, but it's mostly the boring stuff they took out (as opposed to the not-as-well paced Dudley Boyz DVD they put out as well).  There's rarely a slow moment in this one. The DVD contains great matches (particularly the barbed-wire match with the Sandman, the Funk match and the Douglas match) and collects his best promo work.  The promos may not be as controversial or riot-incenting like the Dudley ones, but these are good case studies on how to cut good promos.  Foley's a master at this.
The only downside to this video is the (...) audio whose level fluctuates throughout.  ECW's production values were ""less than professional"" so a lot of the source footage and audio are pretty sub-par and it shows here (as well as the Dudley Boyz DVD).
Overall, if you are a Foley-lover, this is a MUST for your collection.
Highest Recommendation (for all wrestling fans).",1005696000,43,4848,5.098214285714286
1637844,5,B00005NX1R,"I don't know what's better. The matches or the legendary Cactus promos! Cactus v.s. Sabu, probably the 2 most hardcore wrestlers ever. Terry Funk and Sandman are here as well and they rank almost neck and neck with Sabu and Cacti. You have Cactus with the Franchise, Cactus and Dreamer and probably Cactus's most memorable period in ECW: his friendship with Mickey Whipwreck and their reign as tag champs! I fell on the floor so many times from the backstage interviews that I felt like I was in a hardcore match! Also, for those of you who know Cactus's history from WCW...Kevin Sullivan is here too! Definitely worth it!! Now I just wish they would make a 4 hr all promo tape from all the federations Mick has worked in!!!",1004659200,,724,4.576923076923077
1637845,5,B00005NX1R,"This is a great DVD for fans who appreciate how great Mick Foley really is. If you are looking for blood and gore, that is not what this is about. If you are looking for great Foley matches in their entirety, you will be a little upset. Most of the match footage is edited. But that is not why this DVD is amazing. This DVD gives you a great time line of Foley in ECW. But its true brilliance are the promo's. From the ""He's Hardcore"" promos to the legendary ""Dorito's"" promo,This DVD has it. No one cuts a promo like foley.... and if you watch this DVD you will see what I mean.",1004400000,,579,4.087719298245614
1637846,4,B00005NX1R,"Once again this DVD is full of great content as usual in the ECW serie of DVD from Pioneer.  Everything you wanted to see from Mick Foley as Cactus JAck in ECW years is there.  Now hopefully WWF will release a Cactus in WCW at some point.  They don't get a 5 stars rating because their presentation is lacking from past outing.  There is no match or feature listing on the box, no easter egg, no sheet inside the box with a reprint of the cover and match listing.  Even the menu in the DVD itself really lack details with no dates and no easy association to what this chapter will be about.  The ECW video montage is still the same it was in the first DVD, they should really do another one.  They had to cut ring entrance also and music and it was a big part of ECW especially for Cactus.  Like his farewell speech without ""New York, New York"" is not quite as emotional.  But don't get me wrong buy it if you liked past DVD in this serie.  Because the content is as good if not better.  See my best of Dudley review for more.",1004227200,,1026,4.105527638190955
1637847,3,B00005NX1R,"This dvd will leave you wanting more.  The best parts are easily his promos.  However this is not because of Cactus Jack himself, its more of the other wrestlers in ECW just being garbage.  Yes, there are exceptions, but for the most part, they aren't good and selling the moves or making the match seem like a constant flow.  The video of the matches is cheap (because of ecw's limited budget), the camera angles are horrible (when they fight in the crowd, you can barely see a thing) and of course, theres the ecw announcing...makes you wish Jim Ross was calling it.  While Cactus Jack was a great character, and his wrestling was good, you would probably be better off getting the Hard Knocks and Cheap Pops from WWF.  Because this DVD will leave you disappointed.  No extras.  Not even a chapter list.  If you can stand the poor productions of this, you will enjoy it.  Sad because some of his best matches were in ECW.",1003881600,,923,4.506024096385542
7947971,5,B00005NX1R,"The greatest wack job in pro wrestling history.  He could pull off characters like nobody else could, sometimes seemingly changing gimmicks in mid-promo.  I prefer his ECW years, but I prefer everybody's ECW time.  He can also write a mean autobiography.",1272240000,,254,5.146341463414634
7947972,5,B00005NX1R,"NOTE: I updated this review in 2013

This is the one of two ""profile"" sets put out by the original ECW with one starring Bubba & D-Von, the Dudley Boyz & this one featuring Mick Foley under his ""Cactus Jack"" character.  Now unlike how the Dudley Boyz DVD was where it was mostly just highlights & various matches, this goes through each storyline Cactus Jack has had during his career in ECW though match highlights, promos and footage from events. Various highlights include his controversial post-match interview from his match with Sabu where he spat on the WCW Tag Team title, his unlikely World Tag Team Championship partnership with Mikey Whipwreck & feud with Public Enemy, how a match teaming with Kevin Sullivan evolved into a feud with The Sandman & Terry Funk along with an unholy alliance with Shane Douglas, the era where Cactus turns on Tommy Dreamer to join Raven's nest which leads to a collage of his creative ""anti-hardcore"" promos.

Complete Matches Include:
vs. Sabu - There are different stories in regards to how Cactus Jack was able to work this match in ECW while still being under contract with WCW but whatever the circumstances were lead to what was a dream match at that time between two of the most unpredictable & ""hardcore"" wrestlers at that time. Cactus came in the match with a bad shoulder while Sabu had his manager Paul E. Dangerously & his bodyguard 911 in his corner. Sabu targeted Cactus' head with various leaping kicks to the back of the head before using a chair which Cactus later gave a receipt for along with using a frying pan on Sabu & himself. The match briefly went into the front row & around ringside with 911 getting involved while Sabu again used his body as a weapon with moves like the triple jump moonsault over the guardrail onto Cactus through a table & Dangerously using his trademark cell phone when he had the opportunity to. This didn't live up to the ""someone's going to get killed"" hype that it had according to Foley himself but it was a good match with the aftermath being more crazy than the match itself with all the appearances from various stars, people being knocked out with chairs, bottles busted over heads, brawling through the crowd, and tables broken.
Hostile City Showdown 94
[Mick Foley: Greatest Hits & Misses]

vs. Terry Funk - The ""teacher vs. student"" match here that was the defination of ECW hardcore violence.  This turned into a big hardcore war that started near the broadcast position & worked it's way into the ring with a heavy amount of tables & chairs used between the both of them such as taking hard chairshots to the head & Cactus even missing an elbow drop on Funk causing him to land through a table.  As usual with ECW, you had unusual weapons such as a toilet seat & a plunger & a trash can & a flaming branding iron.  If your really into violence then watch out for this very sick part where Funk takes a broken beer bottle & continues to slice Cactus' arm & chest.  This was a very violence match.

Barbed Wire Match: Cactus Jack vs. Sandman - Sandman wore his usual ring gear & Cactus was wearing his cowboy boots instead of traditional wrestling boots while the referee had his arms wrapped & wearing gloves to protect him from the barbed wire as both men started off trying to throw each other into it but able to avoid it until Sandman hit it crotch first before they brawled on the outside with Cactus using a trash can multiple times & later ended up back in the outside using whatever was around them from the guardrail to another fan's crutch. Both men ended up hitting the wire multiple times as Sandman hit back first while Cactus was suplexed onto it before both men started to use the wire as a weapon itself by raking body parts against it until it started to bleed like their faces & arms, an atomic drop across the wire, and Sandman wrapping himself in barbed wire using his body as a weapon while Cactus still resorted to using weapons like a trash can. This wasn't any different than a majority of the matches in their feud where it was just a slow paced brawl but this was the best match in their series.
May '95

Cactus Jack & Raven vs. Terry Funk & Tommy Dreamer - It was during this period that Cactus Jack had joined Raven's Nest & was rebelling against the hardcore environment of ECW to the point where he would cut promos & wear t-shirts showing support to the rival company of WCW to the point where he was wearing a ""Dungeon Of Doom"" shirt for this match. This brawl started both in & out of the ring with Funk using whatever he could get his hands such as a chair on Cactus & throwing it in the ring hitting Raven before more weapons were introduced from a snow shovel to VCR to a toilet seat to a golf club with the referee getting hit with a dustpan for his troubles while a cheese grader was the cause of blood being shed with all this violence inspiring a brand new chant from the audience. Cactus had no other choice to but to get hardcore himself stabbing Funk in the head & arm while still playing mind games showing another t-shirt of the most hated man in ECW that caused Dreamer to pull it over his head & beat the crap out of the image on it while more hardcore violence occurred including a DDT on a chair, others getting busted open, more weapons introduced, cameo appearances, and a post-match brawl involving a head wrapped in barbed wire & camera cables being used. This was the hardcore weapons brawl that ECW built their reputation on.
November To Remember 95
[Mick Foley: Greatest Hits & Misses]

vs. Shane Douglas - This match was happening under unusual circumstances as Cactus Jack made it known that he was leaving for the WWE while Shane Douglas was coming back from WWE & they had unfinished business from when Douglas cost Cactus the ECW Title before he left months earlier. Cactus was in the middle of his ""anti-hardcore"" gimmick wearing his suit & cowboy boots as he wasn't expecting to be competing before Douglas eventually beat him out of his suit & dominated until Cactus had to resort to going hardcore using a crutch on Douglas. Douglas still kept coming after Cactus using the crutch himself along with suplexing him on the guardrail spine first followed by Douglas going aerial with a crossbody off the top rope into the crowd. Both men targeted previous injuries like Cactus working over Douglas' throat while Douglas worked over the leg as various elements would come into play for the rest of the match from the referee to who Cactus was calling for to help him & a point in the match with handcuffs & a chair that most become more famous (or infamous) with Mick Foley in WWE close to 3 years later.

[ECW Unreleased: Vol. 1; For All Mankind: Life & Career Of Mick Foley]

Cactus Jack vs. Mikey Whipwreck - This was not only his last match in ECW but was also scheduled to be the last time we saw the Cactus Jack persona as Mikey came in with a neck brace due to an previous attack from Cactus which he targeted right away with various blows. Mikey fought back using Cactus' own clothesline over the top rope sending him into the guardrail headfirst & continued to dish out his own punishment with a belly to back suplex on the floor, superkicking a chair into Cactus' face, and his own somersault over the railing into the crowd while Cactus' continued to focus on Mikey's neck with a back suplex into a table & his own Cactus clothesline over the railing before taking the match back into the ring removing the neck brace punishing the neck even more with a piledriver & double arm DDT. They continued to brawl in the crowd & in the ring while also having such moments like Foley clutching a Lenord Cohen album (if you ever saw the promo he did before this match, you'll get the joke) while both targeted each others head with chairshots resulting in a match that wasn't a ""hardcore war"" more of an emotional battle with the one man that Cactus helped in ECW more than anyone else.

7947973,1,B00005NX1R,Yo trust me this thing sucked. Don't listen to these other people for a hardcore legend who fought others. Halfway through this thing and I was asleep. I trusted what these people said and I wasted my money and my time. Sure there is a few good spots but they are so far in the dvd u fall asleep before u see it. I reccommed any thing but this!!!!!!!!!!,1117497600,,353,4.130434782608695
7947974,5,B00005NX1R,"You couldn't ask for this man to give anymore than he did for 15 years. Living in his car, going to college, training to be a wrestler, and still finding time for family, his books, and getting himself torn up in the most bloody ways possible. He may not have won many of his Japan matches but he never held back when it came down to kickin butts all over the ECW arena. Mick Foley is the modern day incarnate of Leon Batiste Alberte- a renaissance man. He was an architect, a painter, writer, musician, etc. Alberte could even stand with his feet together and actually jump straight over a man's head. If Foley hadn't fallen off the 16-foot cage, I probably wouldn't even know his name, let alone taken an interest in his career; no matter how bloody it got. It's almost impossible to imagine that Mick Foley has three children, moreso that he WROTE 2 best selling autobiographies.

7947976,5,B00005NX1R,"Quite simply, this just rocks.  I won't give a rundown of the whole DVD as other reviewers have taken to that task.  I will say this though.  There are several clipped scenes, but it seemed to me the full scenes greatly outnumbered all of those that were clipped.  That, or they edited it really good...eh...Either way I don't know what all the whining is about concerning the clipped scenes.  The matches overall are quite good; it's nigh onto impossible not to smile when Cactus drops the elbow. Also, the ""Anti-Hardcore"" promo chapter is masterful.  If his goofy promos don't make you laugh, or his serious ones go ""...Wow...""  I'll come right out and say somethings's wrong with you.  The one where he mentions the Dynamite Kid, Ray Stevens, and Harley Race was especially amazing in my opinion.  Mick Foley will go down as probably the greatest talker in the business along with Flair by virtue of these promos alone.  (Many of his WWF ones will cinch that spot for him also.)  In summary, you need this DVD.  If you have ever even thought about buying it, do it.  If you haven't, do it.  If you ended up here by mistake and don't know a thing about Foley, do it.

7947978,3,B00005NX1R,"In it's short life, ECW was the best wrestling promotion in the world, bar none. The DVDs are a great way for longtime fans and those who are curious to see what the ""revolution"" was all about. The Cactus Jack DVD, while good, falls a little short. It's indicative of a trend in the ECW DVDs, and that is edits. The Pay Per View DVDs (and others, including this one) edit out the the wrestler's ring entrances and other little things, and this DVD features a lot of edited matches, some are in fact just mere snippets of a match. One good move is that Jack's first and last ECW matches are presented in their entireity. But then much of Jack's farewell to the fans gets the edit treatment too. That's a crime. The choice of matches are kind of unusual. Jack either loses, or comes up short in the post match brawl in most of them. Two impressive matches Jack had with the Sandman (both in Florida) are not on the DVD. Big mistake as they were quite impressive, the first of the two in fact featured the nastiest chair shots I had ever sen up to that time. Also nowhere to be see is the famous ""Uncle Willy"" interview, the single best Cactus Jack interview segment in history. It was done after his participation in the imfamous ""IWA King of The Death Matches"" tournament, and the fans are really being cheated by the abscence of this interview.

*Pretty shotty audio and camera work, the camera misses some of the most hardcore things and when a wrestler uses the house mike, its nearly impossible to understand them.
*A lot of the matches are edited.......LOTS. There is only about 4 full length matches on the whole DVD, the rest of the matches go on for no longer then 5 minutes.
*Some of the matches are already on the ""best of"" ECW DVDs, so if you have bought them, you have already got the best this DVD has to offer.
