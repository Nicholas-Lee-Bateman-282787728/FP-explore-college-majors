7811754,3,6301438434,"The Flintstones Meet Rockula and Frankenstone (1979)

From 1979, 13 years after The Flintstones left the prime time airwaves but kept alive through reruns and numerous Saturday morning incarnations, comes this one-hour TV special, which aired on NBC on 10/30/79.  The Flintstones and Rubbles win big on a popular game show, ""Make a Deal or Don't,"" and their prize is an al-expense paid trip to a haunted castle in Transylvania. Betty and Wilma love its touristy charm, but Fred and Barney are too pooped to party, so all turn in early. Unfortunately, the very real monster Rockula startles a sleeping Wilma, thinking that she s his bride. When this misidentification is cleared up, he still wants to marry her, something only possible if she were a widow. Both he, and unfinished creation Frankenstone, are all to happy to make it happen, so poor Fred has to rescue his dearly beloved and save his own skin - and salvage what clearly has turned into a real dud of a grand prize!

Loads of fun, with the usual voices (Henry Corden, Mel Blanc, Jean Vander Pyl) as the main characters. Fun to hear Casey Kasem's unmistakable voice as the game show host, Monty Marble. Without spoiling anything, I will say that Barney winds up saving the day with a very special skill, and no it doesn't involve propelling a rock-heavy automobile with his bare feet.

Also on this tape is The Flintstones New Neighbors, a 30-minute special that was part of a limited-run prime-time series on NBC, owing in no small part to the rating success of the above special. Broadcast on 9/26/80, it also features Frankenstone, but this time as a different character: the patriarch of an Addams Family-esque clan who move in next door to Fred and Wilma. The Rubbles and Wilma are delighted, but Fred plays Archie Bunker and is upset that an oddball family has ""decreased property values"" in the neighborhood (yes, that's actual dialogue). Upon hearing of Fred's intolerance, Barney is furious (you can tell because his pupils get black and huge) and ends their friendship. Only after a picnic, in which Pebbles gets carried away by a pterodactyl and subsequently rescued by Frankenstone, does Fred see the error of his ways and ask for forgiveness from all he offended, which he gets.

This special, I think, is even better than the Rockula one, if only for its message of acceptance and understanding. It was also nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animated Programming, and followed by ""Fred's Final Fling"" in the Flintstone Special run.",1366675200,,2537,4.877030162412993

The Red is really bleeding through from where it is suppose to be. It is watchable,if your not to picky. The story is cute, as well as the bonus one. I'm glad I bought,but not the rest of my family. They are use to DVD images. I hope someday this would come out in DVD.",1252972800,,391,4.090909090909091
7811757,5,6301438434,"This 1992 release includes two classic TV specials.  The first is the 48 minute ""The Flintstones Meet Rockula & Frankenstone"" from 1979.  In this one, Fred and Barney appear on a spoof of the game show ""Let's Make a Deal,"" where they win vacations to Rocksylvania.  Shortly after arriving, the deceased former owner of the castle where the families are bunking, Count Rockula, awakens from a 400 year slumber and decides he has to wed Wilma -- but the only way he can marry her is to make her a widow first.  Pebbles is mentioned near the end, but strangely neither her nor Bamm-Bamm are seen.

The second special is the 24 minute, Emmy-nominated ""The Flintstones' New Neighbors"" from 1980.  A creepy Addams/Munsters-like family moves their home onto the vacant lot next door to the Flintstones.  After bidding the new family welcome, Fred decides that they're ""freaks"" and quarrels with Barney, who likes the newcomers.  But when Pebbles winds up in the path of a Pterodactyl, the three families must work together to save her.  Father Frank Frankenstone is the exact same character design from the previous special, but he speaks with an English accent and is obviously not supposed to be the same character (which could be a bit confusing considering they've packaged them back to back).  A slightly different variation of the Frankenstone family had already been seen in the previous year's ""The New Fred and Barney Show.""

All in all, they're great classic specials, and they're pretty scare-free for those looking for something tame to entertain the kiddies.",1207785600,,1564,4.954022988505747
