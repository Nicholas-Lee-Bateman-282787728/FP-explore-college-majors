8570317,5,B0044Q7DMO,"This is a phenomenal recording by tabla maestro Ustad Tari Khan which is accessible and suited for all lovers of music, including but not limited to the hard core tabla solo fanatics. On this DVD Ustad Tari Khan presents an outstanding tabla solo in teental which begins with a lengthy peshkar full of creative and refreshingly new themes and improvisations interspersed with numerous spontaneous tihais . A series of kaidas follows which are systematically, yet very artistically developed culminating with tihais utilizing complicated and unique structures and formulas. Ustad Tari Khan then playfully explores multiple relas, roas, jattis and classical laggis for the remainder of the vilambit section. In the drut section, Ustad Tari Khan presents numerous fixed compositions including tukras, chakradars and parans which are recited and executed with extreme precision. The recording concludes with one of Ustad Tari Khans signature relas and tihais. The ability to actually visualize Ustad Tari Khan's expressions and his interactions with both the audience and Pandit Ramesh Mishra (who as always, contributes a beautifully rendered lehra) is a definite plus over a conventional CD. For years, devoted fans of Ustad Tari Khan have been waiting for a recording like this. Hands down, this is arguably the greatest modern rendition of tabla solo available on DVD and a must have for all fans of classical Indian and Pakistani music.",1295481600,6,1437,5.391111111111111
