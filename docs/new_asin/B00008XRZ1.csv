7987776,5,B00008XRZ1,"Kagome is a normal high school girl, until she falls down a well at her home on her 15th birthday. She climbs out and finds herself in a 16th century Japan where demons run rampant. She is pursued by a centipede demon and finds herself clinging to a boy stuck to a tree. He wakes up and tells her if she removes him from the tree, he will kill the monster. He makes good on the promise. While the fight goes on a jewel comes out of Kagome's side. It has the power to make any demon or human immeasurable powerful. That makes it a hot commodity. While retrieving the jewel, Kagome breaks it, and the shards are scattered throughout the country. Inuyasha and Kagome must work together to find them all and keep them out of the hands of evil doers.

Inuyasha and Kagome wander along with their friend Shippo. They come across a perverted monk, who also happens to be cursed by a demon. He is also searching for the shards of the jewel. Hoping that he will find shards and get some Kagome action, he decides to tag along with the others and becomes a valuable ally.

This anime is a legend. If there is someone out there who hasn't seen it, they need to remedy that situation as soon as possible. This series has everything. Drama, action, comedy, suspense, and romance. It is a fairy tale that you will never forget. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are also unforgettable. This anime is one of the best ever, and a must see for anime fans of all ages.",1353196800,,1460,4.363970588235294
7987777,5,B00008XRZ1,"Volume 6 of Inuyasha introuduces a new character named Miroku, who at first glance seems to be a new enemy. He's a monk who seems more interested in chasing women than he is in protecting innocents! He even tries to bust a move on Kagome, much to the jealousy of Inuyasha, and Kagome at times seems to be willing to spite her half-demon friend. But Miroku is not an ordinary human. His ancestors were cursed by the demon Naraku to pass down an awful but sometimes handy affliction. His hand is basically the equivalent of a black hole which, when released can suck anything, including our heroes into it! He also offers some clues to what happened 50 years ago when Inuyasha and Kikyo battled against each other. Inuyasha, Kagome, and Shippo will have to enlist the aid of this powerful young monk as Naraku and Inuyasha's half brother, Sesshomaru join forces!

Volume 6 of this excellent series offers all the usuals of Inuyasha. High production values in the animation, humor, horror, compelling storylines, and great character interaction. The mystery of why Inuyasha and Kikyo battled so long ago is a plotline that really picks your brain and you want to find out the cause. Engrossing. The extras are pretty lame as usual, in the form of Japanese promotional ads.",1122768000,,1269,4.7681818181818185
7987778,5,B00008XRZ1,"All Inuyasha DVDs deserve five stars.  I'm singling this one out because the hottest guy in all anime, Miroku, enters the story!  But really the whole series is worth owning.",1081123200,2,174,4.766666666666667
7987779,5,B00008XRZ1,"Haha. with perhaps one of the funniest introductions,we meet the lecherous monk, Miroku. definately a good buy. The combination of sophisticated humor and slapstick, along with the amazing fight scenes makes Inu-Yasha a truly great show, for those of you who haven't started watching yet, hurry up! for the rest, this is an excellent addition to your collection, be warned however, that you need volume 7 to complete the titanic battle between Seshomaru and Inuyasha, that is facilitated by the as yet mysterious Naraku, who we learn has been pulling a lot of strings...",1080518400,,570,5.074468085106383
7987780,5,B00008XRZ1,"This is vol. is one of the number one vol.'s yet released!! they meet this Monk with a wind tunnel in his hand that can suck anything that gets in it it's way and once you are sucked in you are never able to get out there alive, they learn that his great grandfather was a victim of Naraku and this hole is passed down from generation to generation,but there is one thing that they still don't know about him.... he is a [strange] monk!! it is a very funny show!! I recommend this for miroku fans!!",1066608000,4,498,4.144329896907217
7987781,5,B00008XRZ1,"Inuyasha is a great story and very entertaining.  As much as I'm anxious to see the adventures continue, I fear the day they find all the missing shards of the jewel.  Vol. 6 is the best DVD of Inuyasha so far and I am impatient to see the others, I've pre oredered all the future Inuyasha DVDs I'm able to so far, and have seen all the others.  I truely recomend Inuyasha, I watch my share of cartoons (at least 14hours a day)and Inuyasha has me hooked the most.",1064880000,,463,4.179775280898877
7987782,5,B00008XRZ1,"I have seen most of the Inuyasha episodes on adult swim late nights.  The Inuyasha series intreges me because it has a mixture of all film types.  What I wish to state is that this series has a love story like a drama movie.  The story has some grand action like an action movie.  Most of all, it has alot of mystery in each episode that keeps me thinking about what will happen next(that aspect is very hard to judge even after finding all the needed details.  I saw this DVD with a friend of mine who is intreged by anime films.  He and I both agree this movie is a must see for fans of the show, and many anime fans across the world.",1059523200,2,636,4.048
7987783,5,B00008XRZ1,"The storyline introduces a new character to the cast named Miko. More and more of Inuyasha and Kagomas relationship is shown. Of course Shippo (the cutest little demon) is there. And Shessumero is back with a surprising tatic to get the sword of InuYasha! Watch it to see what happens! Oh, I should mention each dvd contains only three episodes and is only avaible in English and Japanese!",1056153600,4,389,4.735294117647059
7987784,5,B00008XRZ1,"I really, totally liked this! Finally seeing that Miroku joined the team, it was pretty cool.... He may be a dirty monk, but he probably made Inuyasha realized he loved Kagome...
 The Hell Painter... *shivers* I don't want to be a painter anymore! Not! I think it was cool that his paintings came to life, but if that were me, I wouldn't draw like that... Heh! I don't even know how to draw that way!
  The last episode.... Was is not Sesshomaru and Naraku Join Forces? I think I remember that being the last episode.... I don't have the actual DVD with me at the moment... But I do have it! I'm gonna go watch it again! Bye!",1055203200,,625,4.279661016949152
7987785,5,B00008XRZ1,"Rumiko Takahashi, ""Queen of Romantic Comedy"", writer of other great animes such as Ranma 1/2, Maison Ikkoku, and One-Pound Gospel, does it yet again with Inuyasha. Excellent crisp animation and sound that follow the original manga story closely. The dialouge is funny, witty, and the characters and plot are well developed, although this DVD isn't availible yet I've seen these episodes (111 InuYasha eps availible in Japanese as of May 21, 2003) and 36 availible in English on Cartoon Network. This is the greatest show of all time and the English version is 100 times better than the Japanese! This DVD also includes awesome extras and is priced right, usually about 10 dollars more expensive in stores, Amazon.com gives a great deal on this one.",1053648000,6,748,4.992
