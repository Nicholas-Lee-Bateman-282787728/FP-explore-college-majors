8758657,5,B01EGQM82Q,"Gladiators, professional fighters, ice skaters -- the public gathers to see the performers get hurt. Gig Young says it best when he says ""They just want to see a little misery out there.""

Perhaps the most fantastic scene is when Susannah York pulls Michael Sarrazin into a closet for something that seems like sex but really isn't. It's human contact she wants. ""Where were you born? Tell me about your brothers and sisters."" True, she is pulling the straps of her dress down, embracing him madly, but it's not sex she wants, it's human intimacy, a little bit of love. The scene gets them both in trouble.

A scene that puzzles me is when Jane Fonda fellates Gig Young for no apparent reason but to gain some sort of advantage.

More puzzling, even disappointing, is when Jane Fonda expresses shock and surprise when she learns she and Robert will be charged for expenses in the event they win. A girl as cynical as Fonda should have suspected this.

Great lines of dialogue: ""I'm keeping an eye on you.""
""Oh yeah? Which one?""

""Did anyone ever tell you...?""
""Yeah, they told me.""

Edited with uncanny skill by Frederic Steinkamp.

You need a strong stomach, but it's a great, classic film.",1502064000,,1191,4.669856459330144
