8655659,5,B00K37D28W,"A must have video for the busy woman.  Perfect for those days when there just isn't enough time to get to the gym.  You can do one or two workouts, depending on how much time you have..or do them all 3 or 4 times a week and you will transform your body.  Since there is no equipment needed, its great to take on vacation!  Deb is a fabulous fitness instructor, with years of experience in both group and private training.  Her work in the area of Pilates instruction is extraordinary.  You only have to watch the Pilates mat workout to see for yourself.  I have had many workout DVDs over the years, and this is by far the best Ive owned.",1402963200,,638,4.223140495867769
8655660,5,B00K37D28W,"I trained with Deb Heil Lemon in her Pilates studio in Phoenixville, PA for 1.5 years and saw amazing results. After moving away I really missed those workouts. This is Deb's second workout video and is amazing. I love the variety of the four workouts and that they are only 20 minutes long each. It makes it very easy to do each workout on their own or combine two of them. I love the burn from the booty workout and am already feeling stronger after just a week of using the DVD. This is going to be one of my must brings on all my business trips.",1401580800,3,549,4.140186915887851
