4049188,5,B0031JMLNQ,"""All of Me"" has been a favorite of my family for years, and the other two movies are the perfect bonus!  Price was right & it was time to replace my old VHS tape!!",1334534400,2,163,3.7941176470588234
4049189,5,B0031JMLNQ,Steve Martin is at his best in these three movies.  We have laughed until our sides hurt! This is an excellent buy!,1334102400,,115,4.2272727272727275
4049190,3,B0031JMLNQ,"I bought this tri-pac because I wanted the movie; ""All of Me"" which I feel is his best movie, just picture how he walks when he is half man and half woman, it just cracks me up! no one could do this like Steve Martin! (put Edwina back in the bowl!) funny movie five stars right there! (tho I have seen some old Dick van Dyke shows and he has the moves also)!  Steve has this one all wrapped up, so I bought the three pack as it was basically the same price. The other movies have no value as far as I am concerned, I would never watch either of the two again, pretty sure I dumped em' I lent out All of Me and it was never returned! that makes me laugh too! so dilemma one movie is five stars, the others have to get one as can't select none, so does it come up seven, no no I have to take away two stars because they have no value so five then, but no how about three stars for the set because the one movie is my favorite Steve Martin movie!",1326499200,2,943,3.8608247422680413
