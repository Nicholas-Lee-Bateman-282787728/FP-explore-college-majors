There's some era relevant background music that plays part way through the documentary, along with some background sounds of street activities. It's as if someone in Germany, during 1932, walked around the city streets and filmed the daily activities of a normal city and now it's for sale.  It is what it is.",1309219200,,457,4.7125

2711811,1,B000LPQE22,"Horrible.  I usually at least like the paranormal investigation movies a little, even if they are bad, but not this one.  It felt unscripted.  Everyone constantly talked over each other in really long drawn out conversations that served no purpose or if they did have a purpose did not accomplish it because there was no real dialog.  Almost the entire thing is shot in the dark with amateur quality camcorders and you can not see anything at all, not that they ever pointed the camera towards what they were ""witnessing"". No action (actually really nothing happening at all) until the last 5 minutes and then it was just stupid..

I fully expected to see video footage of apparitions or even a few disembodied EVP's. I couldn't watch anymore and left it after the psychic claimed to being somewhat attacked by one of the negative spirits. It just looked way too fake to me and very much staged.

You should also know, I'm not a fan of a lot of blood and gore. Saying that, this movie was TERRIBLE!!!!!! I though it had potential in the beginning but there is maybe one good scare and even then I had to rewind and pause to see what the characters were talking about. It seemed to have no climax to it, just a very long beginning..then bam it's over in a 60 second ""scare"", trust me it's not worth your money, wait till it's on prime",1421107200,10,652,4.1015625

2711863,3,B000LPQE22,"A British contribution to the c-movie found footage horror genre. I found the acting and filming to be a bit above the average fare so common today, and I'd recommend it if you are a fan of this genre. The Brits tend to make understated horror that lends more on history and also allowing your mind to develop the horror, rather than the more traditional American approach of hitting you over the head with attempts at scares, or the lame CGI effects (such as the Japanese pale skinned young girl, or the long-face stretch mouth, etc... take your pick). To that end, this movie was definitely different and I'd recommend it as a rental.",1416528000,3,636,4.587719298245614

2711867,1,B000LPQE22,"You know the plot already.  It's been done to death.  Regular folk - could be your or me - go with a film crew to a ""haunted"" location hoping to find real evidence of paranormal activity.  Of course, not only do they find it, but the activity turns out to be more powerful than anyone could have imagined.  The meta-plot, as I understand it, is actually deeper and a bit more unique.  The film-maker claims that many of the people we see on screen are not actors, but were duped into believing that they were on a paranormal research reality TV show.  Thus, many of the emotions and interactions we see between the people on screen are, in a highly edited and superficial way, genuine and reflect what goes on with real-life hauntings.  With this, the film has claimed some relatively uncharted territory in the horror film landscape as more of a psychological art-life project than a storied film.  Unfortunately, without actual development, flat land remains flat, and so this unwatchable movie fails as anything other than an experience for those who were involved.

The film begins with an introduction to the location via a news reporter who talks to a psychic.  We meet the people, who I assume have all been told that they'll be on TV, as they're driving in a limo to the location.  Every one of them claims to be a skeptic, except that they actually do believe in spirits, and are merely looking for the proper evidence to support their beliefs (...some skeptics). The entire rest of the film is an utter mess.  These people walk around, talk over each other, argue, fight for no reason and are eventually scared witless by various staged pranks.  It would be great fun if I could tell what was happening, but without direction or even skilled editing, all I get is a bunch of scream that runs into itself like spilled watercolor.  This being a found-footage style film, we cannot count on the director framing any of the scenes in such a way that would tell a story, either.  The burden of putting a story together is on the viewer rather than the creator, and as anyone who has been bored before knows, maintaining that requires a good bit of mental energy.

There's little atmosphere, no characters to like or dislike and the story is rambling and incoherent - I might as well just go to the bar and listen to drunks tell tall tales.  A true waste of time.",1394841600,20,2367,4.571090047393365
