8281763,5,B001B3LIR4,"This is a 103-minute video recording of the Dalai Lama giving a lecture in 2007. He speaks in his own voice, and you can select Engish subtitles to grasp fully his English, which is sometimes difficult to understand. I think this is a consideration when selecting a DVD with the Dalai Lama lecturing.  The audio is in Dolby Digital 2.0, and the video, which appeared to be shot in HD, is enhanced for widescreen TVs (1.33:1 ratio). He speaks about how inner peace and compassion can lead to prosperity and peace in the world. His words from 2007 foreshadow the current economic downturn. He does wear an eye shade to shield his eyes from the bright stage lights, but you can see his eyes, which well up from time to time as he speaks. He responds to 6 questions at the end. There is a bonus section with short commentaries from Richard Gere and Nicholas Vreeland and other items.",1237161600,4,879,4.528301886792453
