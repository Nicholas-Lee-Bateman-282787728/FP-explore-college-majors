Each one is well researched and presented. Right from the start you realize that the author knows his subject extremely well. Keeps your interest at the maximum all the time and you can hardly want to stop reading. Nothing much more I can add, except that there should be no hesitation about the content; the name of the author is a guarantee of an excellent content and will enrich your knowledge and understanding of this so very complex topic that I am sure a lot of people around the world find very fascinating. Sitchin adds to this fascination with the extensive research he has done throughout his life. I think we, lovers of this topic, have lost a great contributor to out knowledge.",1349136000,,853,4.509677419354839
