8226793,5,B000X35FJK,"The Human Duplicators was released in 1965. A great film that was a B, but what a cast. George Nader, Barbara Nichols, Hugh Beaumont, and George MacReady. Low budget Sci Fi at it's best. Fans of the cast will like this the most.",1463875200,,228,4.325581395348837
8226794,4,B000X35FJK,"Fun and well executed retro sci-fi movie. Richard Kiel's soulful performance as an android is the highlight. George Macready as always is outstanding as a cutting edge scientist.

Good story and effects. If you get a chance to see this it will be a worthwhile experience!",1447632000,,271,4.891304347826087
8226795,4,B000X35FJK,"Although made in the mid 60's, this has the feel of a 70's movie...  The photography, the acting, the sets... or lack there of! A lot of scenes shot on location(s)...

By today's standards - certainly not a great movie - but - to those of us that remember seeing many of this type of movie at the drive-in, an enjoyable hour+ of science fiction.  Many of the faces and voices will be recognizable to this group, Richard Kiel, Hugh Beaumont, George Nader and Barbara Nichols.

As mentioned by another reviewer, you get an early glance of a transporter similar to that used in Star Trek.  The Human Duplicators came out only a year before Star Trek aired it's first season so it was not that much in advance of the series.  If you have ever watched the original Star Trek series, you will get to see how 2 different special effects teams dealt with the transporter effect.

I remember seeing this movie at or close to the time it was first released.  I'm pretty sure it was in a drive-in too.  I never forgot it...  and I'm glad it's available on DVD now.",1302652800,,1053,4.381443298969073
8226796,4,B000X35FJK,"Richard Kiel (tall 'Jaws' from Bond 007) is given a star turn as Kolos, an alien sent to earth to duplicate human beings and replace them with robots.  First in line are scientists and military leaders whom they plan to program for sabotage. George Nader is the top agent assigned to investigate. An early glance at the space transporter like the one used in Star Trek is fun to watch as well as Kolos romancing his weakness (Dolores Faith) that convinces him to abandon his mission and cure her blindness.",1291420800,5,506,4.622222222222222
