8110134,3,B000EHT5IM,"This DVD had alot of stock and misleading shots. In several places vehicles that had not seen active service with the Wehrmacht since 1941 were shown as examples of common equipment in the late WW II period. In one instance I did find what they hose to be very interesting - a series of quick clips showing Pz II's being delivered to the field on tank transporters. I was unable to tell if this was pre-War footage or if they were being deployed before on of the early offensives, but I can honestly say that I have nevere seen, in stills or moving footage, the use of tank transport trucks on German armored vehicles. Plenty of rail footage, but no truck transports. I was impressed and did stop review of those scenes with mymouth open.",1345507200,,738,4.474074074074074
