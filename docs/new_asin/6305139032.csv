8324136,5,6305139032,Fast shipping. I received what I expected. The tape has short stories on it. Not like the negative reviews speak of.,1447372800,,116,4.571428571428571
8324137,1,6305139032,Absolutely terrible.  There is no animations. The characters are portrayed almost as book pages on film.  The voice is a monotone with no inflections or animation.  Overall a very poor value and not to be confused with any optimal Dr. Seuss videos. BUYER BEWARE.,1019692800,14,262,4.909090909090909
8324138,1,6305139032,Unhappy.  That's how I feel about this video.  I read to my children when they couldn't read.  I didn't need a video to do it for me.  I thought I was getting the cartoon that I've enjoyed watching for many years.  I'll certainly learn to read all reviews of videos before I buy from now on.,994032000,7,291,4.125
8324139,2,6305139032,This video (UK format) is not a cartoon in the true sense.  And they have adverts in the middle about other Random House Seuss books which makes the kids think that the video has actually finished.,973987200,9,197,4.472222222222222
