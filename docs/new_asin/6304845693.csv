935863,3,6304845693,"A fair movie,was a sleeper hit. Great cast but I found the movie actually quite boring throughout the first half. The movie gets better as it goes along. It follows the basic plot of good guys v.s. bad guys, and one clan v.s. another clan. The main star is a young man whose father was killed and who was almost killed himself by the same evil clan.",974160000,,349,4.223880597014926
935864,4,6304845693,"With a name like ""The 36 Deadly Styles"" and the accompanying box  art, your mouth starts to water.  Yet you will likely be somewhat  disappointed.  The fighting in the first and middle reels is good, but not  great.  I found myself fast-forwarding through most the film --- a bad  sign.  The plot is passable.  Things get rockin' in the final reel and  really rockin' in the last few minutes.  Is that enough to buy the film?  Add fan-favorite Jack Long to the mix, and you'll probably want this one.",969148800,2,500,4.49438202247191
935865,4,6304845693,"A great film with a great plot.  Ghost Face Killer, along side with the amazing and deadly Silver Fox are searching out Jack Long and the book  containing the 36 deadly styles of kung fu. While Ghost face tracks jack  down, Silver Fox kills all that have gone against them.  While on there  mission of death, the past comes back to haunt them, and a martial  masterpiece takes place as Ghost face meets Jack Long, and Silver Fox  clashes with an enemy from his past. Hwang Jang lee is amazing, and enough  can't be said about Jack and Mark (ghost face)Long.  Some great kung fu,  and a great movie, by one of the best martial arts directors Joseph Kuo. a  must see.",968025600,3,665,4.368852459016393
935866,2,6304845693,I thought this movie was promising at first but it was a bit dissappointing. It is not the worst film I've seen though. The film kept  you thinking there was much more to come. But it did not deliver. The Main  charater I thought was lacking as he did not show any confidence even after  he was taught by his master. Try other films before you buy this one. As a  comprison it was better than Enter the 36th chamber of shoalin. But  Buddhist fist and mystery of chess boxing were much better. This text  refers to the DVD version of the film.,941241600,8,542,4.213592233009709
935867,2,6304845693,"This is not one of Joseph Kuo's Best Movies,Yet if you like chracters who are Funny(ALa Jackie Chan) then you'll like this Movie. 88 minutes of this movie is comical then Jack Long Enters and then the Acton begins. Pick it up  it's worth having in your Collection Especially if you like Jack and  Mark(Ghost Face Killer) Long",940636800,4,325,4.586206896551724
7878570,3,6304845693,"Without reading the description, one would have a hard time even guessing the premise of this movie, much less sussing out an actual plot. The slapstick soundtrack does absolutely nothing for the film. That being said, good (and mostly believable) kung fu throughout. The finale steps the action up several notches from the rest of the film. Morbid curiosity kept me going more than anythung else but overall I enjoyed it.",1524355200,,422,4.957746478873239

7878579,3,6304845693,This movie could have been better with the cast they have. Look for Bolo In dreadlocks. Best part about this movie is the opening theme song & the final fight rematch between Ghostface Killer & Jack Long (Chess boxing),1005350400,,218,4.615384615384615
