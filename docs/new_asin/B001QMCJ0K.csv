3766285,1,B001QMCJ0K,"I thought this box set would come with every
Hellraiser film but I thought wrong.

It's only gonna have the anniversary edition's
of Hellraiser and Hellraiser 2 which I already have.

To me it's pointless because you can buy both those
dvd's under $20 each here on amazon.

Anchor Bay does not know what the fans want.

It is a cool looking box but why bother?

It is a waste of money if you ask me.",1235347200,9,399,4.197368421052632
3766286,1,B001QMCJ0K,"First of all, to those asking ""why isn't this the complete collection?""  I wish we could have gotten that, but Anchor Bay only has distribution rights for the first 2 films.  The rest are in the hands of Dimension Films.

Now to trash a set that I've been wanting for a long time...

Ever since the UK got their version of Hellraiser 1, 2 & 3 in the Lament Cube, fans in the states have been clamoring for a release.  Unfortunately special packaging is rarely released in the US because of complaints of shelf compatibility from both retailers and customers.  Some of us, though, find unique ways to display these wonderful rarely-seen gems, and quickly grab them up.

I won't be doing that with this ridiculous set, though.  It seems that Anchor Bay has said ""OK, here's the packaging you want, but you have to take the total crap that's inside!""  Seriously, why do I need the same copy of Hellraiser 1 that I just bought about a year and a half ago?  Wouldn't it have been better to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the film with the Lament Cube packaging along with the new material?  And why do I need 2 copies of the first movie?  Completely ridiculous.  If I don't have a Blu-Ray player, the 3rd disc is useless to me.  If I do have one, the regular copy of the first movie is useless to me.  No matter what, the consumer is being forced to pay for something they absolutely do not need, even if they own none of the items in the package.

This release is a total dud, and I can't give it any more than 1 star due to the complete thoughtlessness on the part of Starz / Anchor Bay.",1235260800,93,1587,4.3108108108108105
3766287,3,B001QMCJ0K,"No, this hasn't been released yet, but the contents are now well-known.  And no, I don't get it, as the previous reviewer noted.

With DVD sales being what they are and the same companies trying to sell you the same thing all over again (hello, Blu Ray), this is a strange box set and most likely not worth it to you.

The 'newest' thing here is the Hellraiser Blu Ray, which will also be made available on its own.  Otherwise...you get the cool box.  And we've been waiting for a Hellraiser box set that looked like the Lament Configuration, but this isn't it.  It's only the first two films, and it's the 20th anniversary edition of each...both of which have already been available.

Basically, if you haven't purchased the first two films in 10 years, since the tin box from earlier this decade had very nice versions of both with pretty much all of the extras you'd need, then this might be a good pickup.  (The Hellbound: Hellraiser 2 20th Anniversary disc does have a number of new extras not previously seen, while the original only adds a few non-essential interviews).  Otherwise, as has been noted, pick up the Hellraiser Blu Ray if that's what you need, and wait for a ultimage mega-box of all of the films, if they can ever sort out the rights, the format, the versions, and the extras.",1234915200,47,1298,4.536480686695279
3766288,3,B001QMCJ0K,"The two disk in this box are the anniversary DVD's of Hellraiser 1 & 2 wich have been released many, many times (the original in a tin with both films) so if you've bought them in the last 6 years or so you own these editions already. The only new thing here is the HD blu-ray of HEllRAISER, certianly a must have, but why would you want the two DVD's for if you are after blu-ray?

This should have been Hellraiser I & II on Blu-Ray with a bonus, 2-sided DVD copy for reference, what they actually put in the cool box is just dumb.

And yes, I've seen the package, I'm not writing a review on unseen merchandise. IMO, not worth it, just buy the blu-ray.",1234224000,16,654,4.141732283464567
3766289,3,B001QMCJ0K,"Plastic case is pretty flimsy, and there are no inserts (you know, reading material) inside whatsoever.

3766290,4,B001QMCJ0K,"I don't get the price fluctuation here--when I bought this thing a few weeks ago it was $17.99 new, and really, that was a good price for it. It comes with the first two flicks plus a blu-ray, so add a really nifty box and I thought it was a bargain. I definitely wouldn't pay anywhere near $45 for it though. It was a birthday present for someone who only likes the first two movies anyway, so that worked out great. I do think it's a little odd that it comes with the first movie, second movie, and then a blu-ray of the first movie. What a strange combination. Why not just the two films?  Or why not the two films and a novelty, like a small trinket or figurine? Either way, for less than twenty bucks this is a purchase I definitely don't regret.",1331596800,3,751,4.179310344827586
3766291,5,B001QMCJ0K,"Entire collection of Hellraiser movies and ingeniously boxed in a working puzzle box.

Such a great character. The box is such an icon of the movies  and it great to finally have one. The item came in on time and around the holidays no less, which was great, my present to me. Thanks for such an awesome set. I'll will keep this dealer in mind for future items. Thanks again and have great new year.  It's soul tearing time!",1326412800,,497,4.166666666666667
3766293,2,B001QMCJ0K,"Wow - what a disappointment.  I had been lusting over this collection ever since I first saw it sitting on a shelf at BestBuy, but now I cannot even express the amount of failure that is contained whithin the confines of such a small box.  The fact I payed more than thrity bucks for it burns me.

Where to begin? Upon struggling opening the case (supposed to be difficult I suppose, when one knows the role it plays in the films, but still . . .) you are frightfully aware that you may damage something before it even enters your DVD/Blu Ray player.  The plastic is thin and cheap, not nearly as impressive as it looks from afar.  The discs are stupidly held by thin plasic slots inside, almost certainly causing more harm to them than say, a paper slipcase would.  There is also no booklet or paperwork inside, which, I dunno, I sort of expected?

Finally, Hellraiser II played once in my DVD player, and then never played again - the disc is meticulously clean, which leads me to believe that there is some sort of corruption on the disc.  WTF.  And why anyone would want a Blu Ray version and a DVD version together is beyond me - why not just make a 3rd CD of extras?

I love the first two films (and it's a total shame that a complete collection isn't available yet), but they are the only good thing about this set - everything else could have been engineered much better.  Don't waste your money and give in to the looks of this collection - just by them seperately.",1316217600,2,1474,4.343065693430657
3766294,2,B001QMCJ0K,"Not the complete collection, only Hellraiser 1 (1x DVD and 1x bluray) and Hellraiser 2 (1x DVD), so not really a collectors box set of all the films.

-----------------

El contenido de los DVDs es excelente, no hay duda, una gran cantidad de extras y trailers jams vistos. Lo nico malo es la falta de subttulos en espaol para los discos de Hellraiser I y Hellraiser 2, solamente tienen Closed Caption en ingls. Eso es un aspecto que no se aclara en las especificaciones del producto. Si no les interesa el problema del lenguaje con sus subttulos es una buena adquisicin.",1276560000,,688,4.677685950413223
3766298,4,B001QMCJ0K,"This was definiately an Impulse buy. I could have got the movies seperately for cheaper, but i have always wanted a puzzle box in one form or another and then I seen this.

It came well protected in its retail packaging, but the box leaves something to be desired. Made of a cheap lightweight plastic it is noticably lighter than it looks. It gives off the impression that you can rotate the halves of the boxes and in essence ""play"" with the box, but that is not the case, as the halves only fit together in one way. When put together, the fingers of the box halves have nothing to be supported against at the tip and will flex inward.

The movie quality is as others described it, and makes for an enjoyable experience.

In all i'm still happy with the purchase, although I'll probably put the discs into a binder and add some weights to the box and glue it shut, to use as a paperweight of sorts.",1274227200,16,899,4.3076923076923075

It's $15 more than the standard DVD, which isn't a surprise since the movie came out in 1987. Major fans already have the first two Hellraisers, so would they want to pay $59.97 for the boxed set? It comes in a very nifty design that mimics a prop in the movie. But it also contains a complete Hellraiser 1 and 2 on DVD and then Hellraiser again on BluRay. Lots of BuRays also contain a standard DVD, but not often in an entirely new case. Any fan would already have the first two so they're spending an extra $30 just to get the case, assuming they have BluRay. It's a headscratcher.

3766304,5,B001QMCJ0K,"Of the modern era movie monsters, Pinhead from the ""Hellraiser"" films must rank with Freddy Krueger and Jason as horror icons.  ""The Hellraiser Limited Edition Box Set""  contains both 20th-Anniversary DVD special editions of ""Hellraiser"" and ""Hellbound: Hellraiser II,"" as well as the brand new Blu-ray version of the original ""Hellraiser.""  The fun of this set is that it comes packaged in a plastic Chinese puzzle box, replicating the famous box from which the horrors of ""Hellraiser"" emerge.  These horrors are the Cenobites, a collection of frightening sadists who dote on ripped flesh, flayed muscle, and pulsating viscera.  ""Hellraiser"" was the directorial debut of Clive Barker, who manages to create an atmosphere of relentless, undiluted dread.  Images are gruesome, and the grisliest parts of the film focus on close-up mutilation, courtesy of remarkable special effects.

3766306,4,B001QMCJ0K,"Sure, I know, this Box Set is not right, they should have put the Blu-Ray version of at least the first two movies but instead, we get only the first one. Wasn't expecting that from Anchor Bay/Starz Media either, especially with all their great release and packaging.

But just for the Box Set itself, it worth the 20$ more guys ! Trust me. For those who are fans of Hellraiser, and/or those who already own the PAL R2 UK Lament Configuration Box Set, it's well over better in term of quality, and design. First of, that Box Set is made of hard plastic, not hard paper like the UK one, so it will get less damaged with the time, and second, the design and the way it open are amazing. It actually open like in the movie (in one of the way). You can check out my personal pictures in the Customers Pictures section, you'll see. (unfortunately, Amazon didn't uploaded/placed my pictures in the right order, but anyway...)

As for the Blu-Ray version review, well, what can I say more than the quality of the picture and sound are stunning ! I've saw many many details that I didn't saw on the DVD version, and the sound is really good in TrueHD. The bass is pumping a lot, and in 1080p, the picture goes smoothly without lags, unlike in the PAL R2 UK Box Set.

I highly recommend the Blu-Ray version, and that Box Set too, if you're a fan of the movie, and need to put that Box Set in your collection, like me. Or, just buy the standard keep case Blu-Ray, worth the upgrade !",1240358400,7,1473,4.310469314079422

now, the box set only includes the first 2 films, but anybody who has watched the entire hellraiser series can tell you that those are the only ones worth BUYING. rent the other ones sure, but who honestly watched Hellworld more than 3 times?
yes, a complete collection would have been cool for collectors, however, it would have boosted the price at least another [..]  bucks.
now, [...] bucks for 2 movies might seem like a bit much (especially to those of you who, like me, hover like vultures around the cheaper used dvd section), but 40 dollars is about the going rate for 2 new release dvds at retail value. try me. go out to best buy or borders or.... dare i say it... walmart.

8336078,2,B001QMCJ0K,"This is the best 3-disc set for Hellraiser fans in the US and Canada despite its imperfections. It includes Hellraiser and Hellbound with almost 3 hours of bonus material. It comes in a custom made Hellraiser Puzzle Box that slides open to reveal the discs and received the 2009 Reaper Award Winner for Best In Show and Best Packaging. Disc 1 contains Hellraiser DVD, Disc 2 contains Hellbound: Hellraiser II DVD; and Disc 3 contains Hellraiser Blu Ray. Hellraiser is about the Lament Configuration (puzzle box) that calls demons when opened. The demons are Cenobites who enjoy inflicting pleasure and pain (mostly pain for us). This ports the same content from the 20th Anniversary Edition of Hellraiser & Hellbound (e.g. commentary by Barker and Laurence, interviews with Doug Bradley, Andrew Robinson, and Ashley Laurence). Hellbound (Hellraiser II) sees most of the same cast return to battle Pinhead and Dr. Channard. It shocked audiences worldwide when released.

I give the films 5 stars but this boxed set only 2 stars because only 2 of 9 Hellraiser films are included (Miramax distributes the rest). The extra copy of Hellraiser is simply padding. We may never get a deluxe or complete Hellraiser box set in North America. The extras are good but there could be much more of them. Those who own the DVD or BD versions of Hellraiser or Hellbound don't need to bother with this release. Watch the price if you really want this set (cool packaging) because you may be better off buying the films individually ($22 can buy both 20th Anniversary DVDs). Despite its limitations this Puzzle Box set has managed to hold its value. It sports a measly 3-star rating on Amazon. A great future release of the Hellraiser films on Blu-ray should include more of the Hellraiser canon, ditch the DVDs and also have 4-6 hours of bonus content to be competitive.
