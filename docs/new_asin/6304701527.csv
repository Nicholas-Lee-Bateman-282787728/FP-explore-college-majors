920896,4,6304701527,"This movie loses some of the power of Colleen McCullough's novel by glossing over the lonely lives of the main characters prior to their relationship.  It is by seeing Tim Melville, a bewildered child who longs to get in on the jokes at his expense,  get mocked and kicked around by his workmates, and Mary Horton playing the prickly, aloof dragon lady at her office and taking solitary comfort in her carefully arranged life and material possessions, that we appreciate what a transformation each undergoes in the course of the story.  Also, the actors cast do not match the physical appearances described in the novel (a matter on which I usually am not picky, but which does have some impact on the plotline in this case).  Finally, the perky background music can be somewhat obnoxious and occasionally masks the dialogue in my copy.
All of those complaints aside, this is an endearing, moving, and uplifting film with very good acting.  Mel Gibson is excellent, projecting the essential sweetness, enthusiasm, and yearning of his character with his expressive eyes and irresistable grin in the necessary absence of eloquent dialogue.  Piper Laurie could have been allowed to stretch a bit, to show the crotchety spinster she believed herself to be before getting to know Tim, but she is attractive, sympathetic and believable.  The actors who played Tim's parents were particularly good.  One could even argue that the choice to focus more on the dynamics of Mary and the family so dear to Tim allowed a more satisfying conclusion than that of the novel.  I recommend this film to anyone who is interested in seeing Gibson's versatility in a lesser known role, admires Tom Hanks' performance in ""Forrest Gump,"" or simply enjoys Australian film or light drama/romance.",979948800,2,1771,4.996598639455782
920897,5,6304701527,"Mel Gibson never ceases to impress me with his onscreen presence,he is totally captivating and watchable, not just for his looks (some ladies might disagree there) but simply because of the honesty and reality he brings to a role. ""Tim"" is a great example of some of his best work. Playing a guy this childlike and simple is probably one of the greatest challenges for any actor, but Gibson pulls it off with sincerity and credibility. We're not watching the Lethal Weapon guy here, I didn't think of macho Mel once, he WAS Tim. Also excellent were Piper Laurie as his friend and lover, and the actor who played his father. Overall, a peaceful touching movie that is worth renting or buying. Definitely NOT Oprah or Hallmark Hall of Fame garbage. Just another quality Mel Gibson movie.",977616000,2,785,4.737226277372263
920898,5,6304701527,"This movie was the first movie I ever saw with Mel Gibson starring in it.  It is about a young, slightly mentally-challenged gardener who falls in  love with an older woman (Piper Laurie).  The movie is touching, warm, and  beautifully and tastefully acted.  It really shows you how love can conquer  all challenges and that there should be no barriers when two people find  true love for one another.  It left me feeling quite good and full of hope.  I think it is a very good movie.",966470400,,484,4.471264367816092
920899,5,6304701527,"I'm not sure I'd agreed with the review regarding the comparison to Message in a Bottle (which is a melodramatic tragedy). Tim is one of my all time favourite movies (I hated Message in a Bottle). I fell in love with  the movie when I was maybe 13 years old. It's about a middle aged woman who  befriends a retarded man (rather against her will), and they eventually  fall in love. It is ultimately a love story, but much of the movie is about  their relationship and how much it brings her out of her shell and helps  him to understand the world. It is based on a book by Colleen  McCollough....a great book that led to a really touching movie.",957916800,,645,4.289256198347108
920900,4,6304701527,"One of Mel Gibson's earliest films, ""Tim"" has been overlooked by most Mel Gibson fans.  Gibson plays a young, mentally challenged Austrailian in a romantic relationship with an older, American business executive(Piper Laurie). A youthful Mel Gibson shows his talent to create believable characters and make us forget he's acting.
The film examines the theme of star-crossed lovers in the context of age, mental capacity, and social acceptance.  The emotional tide of Tim's family, his lover, and their peers pulls at our heart-strings, and forces a sometimes uncomfortable self-examination of how we judge others and how we may define ""love.""
This movie is a great, romantic tear-jerker. The slower pace and gritty texture of early Austrailian cinema may deter some viewers, but the fresh story-line alone makes this movie well worth watching.
You'll like this movie if:
You liked Kevin Costner's ""Message in a Bottle,"" and enjoyed Mel Gibson in ""Man Without A Face"" and ""What Women Want.""
You'll be disappointed if:
You're expecting a light, romantic comedy like ""What Women Want,"" or the action of ""The Road Warrior.""",945993600,3,1119,5.245810055865922
920901,5,6304701527,"Summer City is hip, smart, funny, the feel-good comedy of the year!  That chase scene at the end with the Tom Skerritt look-a-like chasing the John Stockton look-a-like (or, could it really be him?) was absolutely  hilarious.  The only bad thing is that Mel Gibson didn't wear a Speedo like  he did in Tim.  And, by the way, Tim was also quite good.  It left me  speechless because I was laughing so hard.  The sex scene was rather  disappointing being as I did not see enough skin (though I was not  particularly anxious to see Ms. Laurie in the buff).",918518400,3,553,4.44
921026,5,6304701527,"A great adaptation  of the  book
 It stays very close to the original  story.
It treats a sensitive  subject  with care and respect.  Tim's mental aptitude  is never made cartoonish.
The love that develops  is slow and true.
She helps him to grow and experience  more out of life. He helps her to open up to life other than the academic.
A sweet and unusual  love story.

My daughter and I watched this movie as a joke, knowing how TERRIBLE it would be (read the plot summary) and in that regard, it did not disappoint!!! We wanted to see how long we could endure and stayed until the end -  regretting every moment, of course!! (As they say, it's an hour and a half+ of our lives that we'll never get back ...)
There must be some sort of record set by the number of hideous caftans worn by Piper Laurie, every line of tragic dialogue, the music score dubbed from a bad cartoon series, and the pitiable ""acting"" of Mel Gibson. CANNOT believe that it is the same Mel Gibson who went on to star in so many blockbusters and win an Academy Award for Best Director (Braveheart)!!!

It's the stunningly gorgeous Piper Laurie, however, that owns this movie. She is truly one of the greatest, yet most underrated actresses of all time. Michael Pate's adaptation of the Colleen McCullough novel, leaves out integral parts of the story, so that in the hands of a lesser actress, one would have to wonder what Mary's true motivations might be. Piper Laurie's acting transcends the gaps in the script. There are moments where her facial expressions, and the way she uses her hands to convey Mary's emotions, speak so eloquently that with even a few simple words, she manages to convey pages of internal dialogue. In all honesty, this film is rife with continuity errors, and the writing and production seem hurried and slapdash. It's still worth watching, however, because the amazing performances rise above the material and deliver a truly touching, and tender story about the transformative power of love.",1407283200,,1094,5.151685393258427

Could this be the fantasy of Colleen McCullough who wrote the book it is based upon? Has it ever happned in real life? Michael Pate wrote the screenplay and directed this low budget film (1979) with care and discretion. The character of Tim (well played by Mel Gibson, AFI best actor) is ""not the full quid"" but he is sensitive and instinctive and made it to Year 10 at school. He is so nice and honest and good tempered it is almost impossible to suspend belief that he is a real person. His parents (beautifully played by Alwyn Kurts and Pat Evsion, each AFI winners) and sister, well played by Deborah Kennedy, are well-drawn flawed individuals whereas the good looking Tim comes across like a Ken Doll Stepford Husband. That is possbly why Piper Laurie falls for him and marries him. Only the sister voices opposition but the viewer will spend a lot of time finding a reason not to loathe Laurie for being an exploitative old cow.

Although not in the public domain, for some reason ""Tim"" has been subjected to countless poor-quality, bargain bin, pirated VHS & DVD releases.
These are invariably taken from an edited (93 mins, despite their sleeve's claims to the contrary), faded, worn out VHS master & hugely impair the enjoyment of this simple but great film.

Touted as being digitally remastered, the region 1 NTSC disc's main feature is taken from a very good condition, though not perfect, print. (Do any pristine prints of this actually exist anywhere?)

It's open matte, in the 4:3 (1.33:1) aspect ratio & runs to 108:20 mins. Though the case states the soundtrack is 2.0 stereo, it's actually in the original 2.0 (dual) mono.
The main drawback with this transfer is that it has been slightly vertically 'squished', meaning that characters & faces on screen appear somewhat elongated. This is fairly slight though & will hardly be noticeable to most viewers.

Also on the disc is a completely separately-encoded French language dub of the film. This print source, though decent enough (& 'squish'-free!), is not as clear as the first, with many speckles & scratches. Far worse is the quality of the dub, which is very lo-fi. Tinny & indistinct, it sounds as though it was recorded in the next room! Obviously, this soundtrack is also in the original 2.0 (dual) mono.
It is taken from an unconverted PAL master, so though again full-length, it runs 4% faster, at 103:38 mins.

Finally, there is an illuminating 18 min interview with the director, Michael Pate. Although there is no indication as to when it was recorded, it looks to have been relatively recently, sometime before his death in 2008. This is a valuable supplement, as he talks very eloquently & goes into great detail about many aspects of the film's production.

In summary then, though I have to deduct one star for the 'squishing', for the time being - & probably for several years to come - this is the only edition to own.

Tim is considered a sweet but incapable man by most people in his life.  His parents protect him, his co-workers take advantage by leaving him the grunt work to do, and his sister wonders why anyone would want spend extra time with him.  Ms. Horton, an older, educated woman and employer, is the only one that recognizes his potential and realizes he's worth treating as an equal.  She walks a fine line of protecting and respecting him and ultimately gives him the greatest gift of all, her heart.  He does the same and it's wonderful story to see unfold.

922770,4,6304701527,"One of Mel Gibson's earliest films, ""Tim"" has been overlooked by most Mel Gibson fans. Gibson plays a young, mentally challenged Australian in a romantic relationship with an older, American business executive (Piper Laurie). A youthful Mel Gibson shows his talent to create believable characters and make us forget he's acting.

The film examines the theme of star-crossed lovers in the context of age, mental capacity, and social acceptance. The emotional tide of Tim's family, his lover, and their peers pulls at our heart-strings, and forces a sometimes uncomfortable self-examination of how we judge others and how we may define ""love.""

This movie is a great, romantic tear-jerker. The slower pace and gritty texture of early Australian cinema may deter some viewers, but the fresh story-line alone makes this movie well worth watching.

You'll like this movie if:
You liked Kevin Costner's ""Message in a Bottle,"" and enjoyed Mel Gibson in ""Man Without A Face"" and ""What Women Want.""

The plot is worthy of the Lifetime channel but Laurie and Gibson are great and the supporting cast which includes respected Australian actors Alwyn Kurts and Pat Evison transcends the simplistic and slightly pervey script.

This Australian film was made so quickly and cheaply, I don't believe they even did second takes. Happily, the 30th anniversary edition has been remastered so it is a clear and watchable print and re-edited to include a couple of deleted scenes.

Of course, young Gibson's gorgeous blue eyes, cute accent and his character's charming innocence are so very appealing that the script actually seems plausible. Mel's physical attributes are happily highlighted by his short shorts work outfit and by the blue Speedo style trunks he wears to the beach. Gibson looks quite angelic in the white dress suit he is wearing in one pivotal scene. His engaging performance here makes one sad to consider the buffoon into which he has evolved.",1250294400,22,1712,6.848623853211009

I still recall making a mental note of how hot the leading man was (at that time Mel Gibson was yet to become a household name). And so, I could not resist this purchase, especially given the low price of the DVD.

Well, Mel Gibson is still hot (in the movie; in real life, not so much); Piper Laurie - piping HOT! (who knew!? that woman had some body on her!); the story - as sugar sweet as I remembered it...The story must have been trully revolutionary by the 1970's standards: a mentally slow man in his 20's and an educated and independent woman in her 40's fall in love. Though its telling is a bit stiff and naive, the questions the tale raises are relevant to any modern couple (mainly: can a relationship work, when the control is so steeply tipped toward the female?). Since I am not aware of many of such parings in real life, I am sure this love story may still make some uncomfortable. Nonetheless, I enjoy it for the uplifting moral which teaches us that love conquers all and is above the judgement of those outside of the two people involved. Not always so in real life, but that is precisely what movies are for!

First, let me emphasize that my complaint is not with the content of the movie which is surprisingly faithful to the book.  I've owned 'Tim' on VHS for many years and clearly understood that this version had not been digitally remastered or such.  I expected the poor image quality, I simply wanted to be able to watch from a DVD rather than a videotape that was beginning to show its' age.

My issue with this DVD is that a pivotal, and I mean pivotal scene between Tim and Mary is completely left out of this version of the film!  I kept 'rewinding' thinking I had somehow missed it but, no, it was not there.

Should I complain so vocally over a $4.99 DVD?  Perhaps not, but for those of you who are fans of the movie and just looking for a more contemporary medium to view it in, don't bother with this particular copy of 'Tim'.  In comparing the number of minutes on each of the 'Tim' DVDs offered here it would appear that they are all likely missing that scene.

And it's a love story that involves a simple minded man ""Gibson"" some think retarded that falls in love with a much older woman named Mary beautifully played by Piper Laurie.

Tim ""Gibson's character"" starts to do odd jobs for Mary and he starts to have feelings that are foreign and confusing to him.

Meanwhile Mary is feeling the same way about him but because of the age difference and his simple mindedness she think it taboo to love him.

What follows is a beautiful and almost fantasy like love story that will melt your heart and make you wish you yourself could find a ""Tim"".",1173744000,6,763,4.4855072463768115

922937,5,6304701527,"Did you know that Mel Gibson starred as a mentally retarded young yardworker at age 19 in an Australian film, TIM?  In this love story, Tim is working odd jobs, living with his parents and older sister, and jumping with hormones and bulging with muscles.  He's a looker alright, and many women notice him, but then they find out that he's a ""few bob short of a quid"", while his mates tease him mercilessly.

Piper Laurie plays a business woman living alone who needs yard help.  She's smart, independent and doing great for 1979.  Only one thing:  no man in her life, none can please her, until puppy-like Time, half her age, appears with a rake at the door, and follows her every word.  Now how's that for a man, and a gorgeous hunk to boot?

What's interesting in this story - both book and film are well-done - is the deliberate set up done by Colleen McCullough, later known for the bestseller, ""The Thorn Birds"".  She was an Australian biologist who got as far as working in research at Harvard in the 1960's.  As a female, she got just over half of what the male researchers were earning, based on the fact that ""they're men"".  She was furious about it, and champed at the bit, but couldn't afford to quit.  So she started writing this first book, purposefully creating a story of impossible tension where the love affair simply cannot  - well, almost - cannot be consummated, much as all the readers are rooting for it.  The book sold 50,000 copies and brought her enough money to quit the ripoff research job.

Inspired by this sucess, she turned on the same formula to create the Thornbirds plot, where a Catholic priest is in love with a girl, who later as a woman does bed him, well, much later, but that provides many pages of tension for the reader.

McCullough remains an excellent researcher in all her novels, and of course, you may know that THe Thornbirds became a film.

In this regard, I recommend TIM, because it is an engaging film, it shows Australia in the late 1970's (feminist days), and it is all a very deliberate wink at women's yearning for impossible matches.

Mel Gibson was just beginning to enter some years of debauchery, full of drinking and promiscuity, which he now fully admits.  In fact, when interviewed about his controversial film, THE PASSION, he freely states that his 20's were a crazy time, for which  he now feels himself in an unremitting contrition. That is why he became interested in reviving the old traditions of the Catholic Church, full of judgment, recrimination and punishment, chastising sin heavily but promising redemption.  IN this film, you can see him BEFORE he ruins his youthful body and face with the devil's business.

I don't know if it has been improved in the DVD version, but I will soon find out.  Give this movie a chance and I promise you won't regret it.",1083888000,6,953,3.963157894736842
923027,5,6304701527,"This early film in Mel's career shows his great ability to act in a non-action role. His character is a little slow and his family shelters him from some harsh realities. He gives this role 110% and it shows! I would have liked to have seen more depth in the story itself but the DVD wrought some tears out of me. Piper Laurie...I'm not a big fan but she does her role very good. Mel is the true winner here and if you are a fan you have to see this to really appreciate his acting ability. Plus, he is so absolutely sexy in some tight shorts and a speedo! What ""wouldn't"" I do to be one of his leading ladies....xxxooo",1083715200,4,619,4.12396694214876
923028,4,6304701527,"Before Mel Gibson became the controversial director of the edgy hit, ""The Passion of the Christ,"" he starred in an almost forgotten but award-winning 1979 movie, ""Tim."" It is an understated, yet excellently crafted love story.

Tim Melville has the innocence and desire to love of Forrest Gump, but is not the cartoon of a character as Tom Hanks portrayed. He lives with his soon-to-be-married sister and parents in a small, working class home.

Like in 1981's ""Gallipoli,"" Gibson is a young Australian, complete with an accent. Here, he is a slow, but gentle laborer who does yard work for Mary, an older woman, played by Piper Laurie.

Slowly, they discover that although 20+ years separate them, they are falling love. His parents and sister protect him and want the best for him. They show mixed feelings about the relationship that Tim and Mary do not realize exists.

This is a romance, but it is also about the love of Tim's father for his son, and of the process of life. It is sad; expect tears to be shed.

We see Gibson in a role that highlights the working man, the need to respect and care for the mentally challenged, and the show the many layers of love in a family.

It is unrated, but probably deserves a PG rating. There's no profanity, violence or adult scenes. The audio is decent, but the video quality is lacking. The age of the original film shows some deterioration. There are no extras to speak of, except for a short bio of Gibson and Piper.

923143,5,6304701527,"Having read the book, I can see why Gibson was chosen for the role. Tim is described as someone with features that would have inspired Praxiteles.-Classic and beautiful in Greek purportions. Despite the lack of blond hair that Colleen McCoullough ascribed her mentally diminished hero, Gibson gives him the vulnerabilty and nobility that McCoullogh describes. Piper Laurie is marvelous as Tim's employer, caretaker, and eventual love interest. The Australian landscape was gorgeous(it reminds me of Hawaii, where I lived as a child). But I was glad this film spares us the full descriptions of how Tim was treated by his co-workers. This is a very sensitive, well-thought piece, and I guess I can overlook many inconsistancies with the book and just enjoy the beauty of it.",1035158400,7,773,5.142857142857143

923145,4,6304701527,"This is a gem of a film, starring the underrated Piper Laurie in the role of a well to do, but lonely, business woman, Mary Horton, who befriends a very nice, good looking day laborer, Tim Melville, earnestly played by a very young Mel Gibson. Tim happens to be a little simple. His family describes him as being ""a few short of a full quid"".

While he does work around her house, she gets to know him, as well as his working class family. As time goes on, a deep fondness that ripens into love develops between the two. He brings her out of her shell, and she teaches him to read and explains concepts that will enable him to function better in the world around him. Based upon Colleen McCollough's book of the same name, this is a very well acted film, with fine performances by the supporting cast, as well as the leads.

The quality of the DVD is bargain basement with no additional features. That is to be expected, as the price of this DVD is likewise bargain basement. One gets what one pays for. Moreover, the DVD picture is best described as grainy. This is unfortunate for such an excellent film.

923147,4,6304701527,"This is by far the most under acknowledged film of Mel Gibson's (and Piper Laurie's) career. The scenery of Australia and the poignant plot combine to create a touching and very convincing story. Piper Laurie portrays a middle-aged, dour, executive named Mary Horton, we assume she is a widow, who by happenchance hires Tim Melville (Mel Gibson) to do the gardening around her home. Tim is much younger than Mary, and is very aware that he is ""not the full quid"". When Tim's mother suddenly dies, his father asks Mary to watch over Tim, and if the father should die, Mary is to take over Tim""s care. Mary agrees, but doesn't realize she has already fallen in love with Tim.
The film's cinematography has few long shots, so the glimpses of Australia's beautiful eastern shoreline are few and far between, and some scenes are not well lighted, but our imaginations work overtime and catch us up into the world of this romance. Mel Gibson is very convincing as Tim, and by the end of the film you see a maturity in his character that leaves you wanting to delve further into the life of Mary and Tim. I believe this interpretation of Colleen McCullough's book is one of the best portrayals I've seen. It is my number one favorite of Mel Gibson's work, right next to ""The man without a face"" and ""Forever Young"".",1005609600,3,1308,4.594017094017094
923148,4,6304701527,"One of Mel Gibson's earliest films, ""Tim"" has been overlooked by most Mel Gibson fans.  Gibson plays a young, mentally challenged Australian in a romantic relationship with an older, American business executive (Piper Laurie). A youthful Mel Gibson shows his talent to create believable characters and make us forget he's acting.

The film examines the theme of star-crossed lovers in the context of age, mental capacity, and social acceptance.  The emotional tide of Tim's family, his lover, and their peers pulls at our heart-strings, and forces a sometimes uncomfortable self-examination of how we judge others and how we may define ""love.""

This movie is a great, romantic tear-jerker. The slower pace and gritty texture of early Australian cinema may deter some viewers, but the fresh story-line alone makes this movie well worth watching.

You'll like this movie if:
You liked Kevin Costner's ""Message in a Bottle,"" and enjoyed Mel Gibson in ""Man Without A Face"" and ""What Women Want.""

You'll be disappointed if:
You're expecting a light, romantic comedy like ""What Women Want,"" or the action of ""The Road Warrior.""",1005350400,13,1122,5.205555555555556

Had met a young man of 24 who was mentaly handicaped (Mel Gibson) and took him under her wing and loved and felt compassion for him.  With the amount of time they spent together thier feelings for each other grew stronger and they find out that there love for each other is not just emotional.
