722610,5,6303908802,I had seen Ali McGraw's Yoga Video and also Brian Kest's... Karen's  YogaSculpt is Superior because of her taking the time to make sure you know  how to do the poses correctly. The other videos fail to do that important  step. It's a great workout but also leaves you feeling relaxed and stress  free. I love it!,965174400,9,312,4.421052631578948
722611,5,6303908802,"Karen's new videos will leave you refreshed and invigorated.  Once I have completed this challenging video, I feel stretched, strengthened, toned and very peaceful.  If you are just starting out, be patient with yourself.  Yoga will develop patience, character and strength.  Think of each posture  as a goal; by the third or fourth time, you may achieve what you see.  This video is a combination of Pilates and Yoga.  Ordering a sticky mat is  essential (information is included in video pamphlets) so you don't injure  your muscles by slipping on a carpeted surface.

There are no spiritual  references and Karen's calming voice leads you through the poses in her  organized way.  The music is very relaxing and almost makes this the  Nordstrom of Yoga videos.  I recommend walking for at least one half hour  before attempting the stretching exercises.  This helps to warm the muscles  and allow for a deeper stretch.

722612,5,6303908802,"Karen Voight has provided us with a great intermediate yoga workout.  As usual, Karen finds a way to make you stronger and more flexible, doing so in a safe and careful way.  She explains how to do the poses in a way that  allow you to follow along with ease.  This workout is not for a beginning  yoga student but rather for the person who is seeking to advance past the  beginning level.  For those of you who want to be able to do power yoga or  ashtanga style yoga but are a little afraid to try it, this is your  entry-level video. All the poses you need to learn in order to be strong  enough to do power yoga are in this workout.  After doing this class for  awhile, I was able to move into an ashtanga style yoga workout without much  difficulty.",957657600,12,754,4.152777777777778

She is so clear and concise with what you are to do that you almost don't need to watch it, just listen. It is very challenging, while being at a slow pace that you can follow and get second chances to get it right.

722706,5,6303908802,"I used to take daily aerobics classes from Karen back in the day and always found her to be so clear and correct in her instructions - in addition to being a really nice person.  Not too chatty, either, which I liked.  After many years of not doing any workouts either at home or in a gym, I decided to try one of Karen's DVD's thinking that it might feel like being back in class with her.  Happy to report that it does just that.  I found the Yoga Sculpt DVD to be challenging but do-able (with a few breaks here and there) and Karen's guidance was just how I remembered it to be.  I also appreciated the fact that the background music was very soft and unobtrusive.  I'll definitely stick with this and will probably purchase more of her DVD's.  I don't think you can go wrong with her.",1391472000,,789,4.22

It is challenging for those over 50, (I'm 57) but it is still my favorite stretch video.  I just love her style.",1388620800,,458,4.044444444444444

722755,5,6303908802,"I have never been able to get into yoga, but this workout is fantastic. The flow portion of the workout is as challenging as you care to make it and not boring at all (that is my beef with yoga - I get bored with it easily). The classical music in the background is relaxing and beautiful. The floor portion is killer and really works your core. It reminds me of a ""Pure Barre"" class that I tried out recently.

722758,4,6303908802,"I really loved being introduced to yoga with this DVD. The poses and stretches are challenging, yet do-able for me, and I feel like I'm getting a workout. The stretches make my back feel great and I can feel my core strengthening. Even after not doing yoga for a while, I loved coming back to this DVD to get started again. The only part I am a little frustrated with is the fact that I have bad wrists, and have to alter the set that uses too much wrists, but as long as I am gentle and don't push myself into them too long it is fine.",1305504000,2,536,4.018691588785047

(But you will break a sweat, the ab work is hard, and it is definitely more than just stretching.) If you are looking for a yoga workout that takes the physical benefits of yoga training without the Eastern religious dimension than this is a great DVD.

722761,5,6303908802,I do yoga interchangeably with other workouts between pilates and interval training days. If you're like me this workout has some tough parts that will definitely try you.

722762,5,6303908802,"If you have never tried Yoga, this is THE DVD for you!

I had this video on VHS years ago, and was so sad when I lost it.  Then I found it on Amazon a few years later, and I was so excited.  I purchased it right away, and was very glad.  I had forgotten how great of a work-out it is!

I work-out to this video a few times a week.  It is a stress-relieving, simple work-out that only takes 45 minutes MAX.  It is unlike any other yoga videos I have tried -- no matter how advanced you become (even years later), this routine will still kick your ""patootie""!  It is a full work-out for beginners or experts!  I LOVE IT!  It combines strength, yoga, stretching, balance and muscular development.  Simply great!

Thanks Karen!  You really know how to keep me in shape!

722802,4,6303908802,"I own a couple dozen yoga DVD's, and this one is a little different.  At first I thought it wouldn't challenge me much (I am used to power yoga along the lines of Baron Baptiste, Mark Blanchard, and Seane Corne), but after a few minutes, I realized that the slowness actually meant holding poses for longer, and there is plenty of challenge in so doing.  The music is very different- quiet, classical music- but a nice change from the traditional chanting or no music at all.  I would recommend this to a beginner, since she explains the movement into and out of poses well, and because she doesn't use a lot of the technical names for poses, but more experienced yoga lovers will get a nice, deep stretch, and a muscular endurance challenge as well.",1210723200,6,750,4.54074074074074
722803,5,6303908802,"This is a GREAT yoga dvd FOR PEOPLE WITH BAD BACKS. I feel better after doing this than going to the chiropractor. (My chiropractor didn't like it when I told him that). It is incredibly gentle and the flow of the stretches seem to be in the perfect order. It is much too easy for me now, but I use it whenever my back goes out. Which is only about once per year since I've been doing yoga. I recommend it to all of my friends.
Her ab section is good too. As with all of her videos, her instruction is great. She gives lots of rests so you don't lose your form. And if it's too easy, just skip the rests.
I now do Brian Kest's and Barone Baptist's videos... which I like.
One Warning. This workout is also on another one of Karen's DVD's... check out the other review. It's slightly confusing because the names seem to vary. You're better off buying the other and get a sculpting workout too.",1194220800,2,892,4.191860465116279
722804,4,6303908802,Excellent cuing on form and breathing. I love to do the 20 minute matwork at the end of a different cardio workout. Excellent abs/back workout with nice stretching to wrap it all up. I always feel refreshed afterwards.,1175990400,3,218,4.7631578947368425
722805,5,6303908802,"I've owned this DVD for a while now - for some reason I keep forgetting how much I enjoy it and it finds itself left on the shelf. Then I rediscover it and fall in love all over again.

This is a fantastic, challenging yoga/pilates workout. Karen's form and cueing are exceptional - she reminds you to place your weight here, push your foot there, bringing your own form and workout along in leaps and bounds. It will push you - some of the balancing poses will really force you to focus on stabilising your torso so you don't fall, and the warrior/triangle series really makes my legs shake.

The workout can be done as a whole, or you can choose from the 25 minute ""Flow Series"" or the 20 minute ""Pilates/Yoga Matwork"" section.

I would recommend this to those with some background knowledge of yoga; although Karen's instruction would probably allow a beginner to use proper form, I suspect it may be too challenging.",1170460800,8,920,4.5636363636363635
722806,5,6303908802,I like this DVD a lot. Karen Voight gives clear instructions and I found the excersises and stretching to be very effective.,1153440000,4,124,4.681818181818182
722807,2,6303908802,"I love Karen Voight, but was extremely disappointed with this DVD.  It is the EXACT same DVD as Yoga & Sculpting even though they have different release dates, 4 years apart!  The cover on the DVD is different but she's wearing the same outfit and does the same routine.  They don't tell you that in the advertisement.  Because I liked Karen Voight, I ordered another DVD and then ended up with 2 DVDs exactly alike.  I was so upset about this that I emailed her company and told them about it.  They knew they were the same but don't tell you that in the advertisement. They were nice enough to exchange YogaSculpt for another DVD for me.  But it was a pain because I had to send them YogaSculpt and wait for them to send me something else.",1152057600,43,741,4.326086956521739
722808,5,6303908802,"Karen is such a great instructor.  She's motivating and fun and works you hard - but not in a bad way.  This is another great workout of hers and at the same time you are working hard, it's also kinda relaxing.

The moves here are mixed yoga, pilates and muscle toning.  You will sculpt your body if you do this often and consistantly.  You engage several muscles at a time to get the most benefit, since you are strengthening some muscles and stretching others at the same time.

This is a good 42ish minute long dvd that is enjoyable to do because of her great instruction and beautiful set and music.  I love this workout alot.",1147305600,5,630,4.379310344827586
722809,5,6303908802,"I bought this video because (other than the fact that it was cheap) I love yoga, but don't usually feel like I'm getting a great workout at the same time. And that's what this is- a real workout wrapped into a nice, short (40 min) yoga class. It has a very fluid, relaxing yoga class setup, but she sticks mainly to the moves that will tone you up. You can feel yourself working. I do this tape when I really want to do yoga but know I need a good workout. Plus, you'll get a great stretch. I was already flexible, but whew! I haven't been able to bend like this since I was about 10!

This is definitely one of my most used fitness dvd's.",1138665600,12,639,4.071428571428571
722810,4,6303908802,"I am used to ""Steve Ross,"" and his Yoga routines.  If one is familiar with Ross, one knows that while he knows his yoga, his method is fabulously offbeat!  I find it difficult to do ""other"" yoga routines, especially after being such a dedicated follower of Ross.  This yoga workout, by Karen Voight, was given to me as a gift.  As I requested of my daughter, if she was going to get me a new yoga workout to add to my routines, it had to be at least intermediate level, and it had to be at least 45 minutes long.  Well, with the ""YogaSculpt,"" she came through, as does Karen Voight.  While the poses are familiar to those who practice yoga, ie.:  ""downward dog,"" ""warrior I & II,"" ""child's pose,"" ""chair pose,"" and more, Karen's approach is a relaxing, yet full-body workout/stretch that combines a calm setting with a single instructor (Karen), minimalistic set, and subdued, light classical music.  Karen's calm voice guides the exercisor through a set of standing and sitting poses that as mentioned, are quite intense, yet very relaxing, invigorating, and even challenging for the beginner to intermediate yoga afficionado.  I could feel the intense stretching (these were not ""ouch"" level...rather, the stretches felt great and depending on one's level, one can deepen these stretches to one's level), and my body actually became a bit shaky during some of the poses (from the intensity).  One has the choice of ""mixing and matching"" routines, such as the standing ""flow"" routine and the ""pilates-style"" floor routine, but I do both.  The standing routine really improves flexibility and balance, while the sitting portion really works on strength and balance--especially stabilizing one's abdominal and back muscles.  The brief ending stretch was a relief and it was easy to recover and I felt quite relaxed when the workout was completed.

So, if you are a beginner to intermediate level, this is an excellent yoga workout that provides room to improve as well as providing wonderful stretching, breathing and more importantly--relaxation!  Give Karen Voight a try...She is actually good, and I really enjoy the workout.  Daughter, I thank you!",1135814400,7,2151,5.002808988764045
722811,4,6303908802,"My preferred method of exercize is sculpting and toning with weights.  However, I'm trying to get more into Yoga and Pilates so that I can also lengthen and stretch my muscels.  I am finding it hard to get into this method of exercize, but Karen Voights Yogasculpt is a good starting point.  Most importantly, it is pretty easy to follow - her cuing is very clear and descriptive - so even at points where you can't look at the TV screen, you know what you are doing. (some other ""beginner's Yoga"" DVDs are not so clear)  The only thing I don't like is when Karen uses expressions like ""the other leg"" or ""the front arm"".  I always prefer the instructors to say Right or Left, so there is absolutely no confusion.  I find this DVD somewhat boring and holding some of the poses is a bit tedious, but I guess this is what Yoga is all about.  The abs section does give your stomache a good burn, so you know it's working.  And I have to say, when I'm done my whole body feels great.  I'd recommend this for anyone who is trying to get into Yoga.",1116892800,6,1042,4.248730964467005

I have now done this video three times.  Each time, there have been sections that were almost too challenging for me to complete them.  I appreciate that in a video, as I have room to grow.  I look forward to the day where I can hold downward facing dog through the entire sequence.

This video requires no equipment except an optional sticky mat.  It is really great for a road-warrior like myself.

This is a 45 minute video broken into two parts, yoga and a pilates-based abdominal workout.  It also includes a stretch and a warmup, as all good videos should.  The yoga section is no-nonsense and hard.  I can see where this would sculpt your body.  At the same time, it has an immense relaxing effect.  The pilates section is a great challenge for my core muscles.",1101772800,6,1007,4.573033707865169

Ordering a sticky mat is essential (information is included in pamphlets or amazon sells lots of yoga mats and even bags to carry them in...) so you don't injure your muscles by slipping on a carpeted surface.

722898,4,6303908802,"Karen Voight's YogaSculpt combines classic yoga poses with innovative twists to turn up the intensity and focus on sculpting.  Karen begins the workout with a relaxing breathing exercise but then quickly steps up the pace with a challenging sequence which combines down dog with high push up pose.  The standing series includes traditional yoga poses such as Warrior 1, Warrior 2, and Triangle pose, but Karen combines each pose with extra lengthening and stretching moves.  The first half of workout last approximately 25 minutes, and then it's on to the floor for approximately 16 minutes of mat work focused on the abdominals and back.  In this section, Karen combines yoga poses such as Boat and Bridge with Pilates-type movements.  Both the abs and the back receive thorough attention, and then the practice ends with a brief stretch.
Karen is an excellent instructor who performs the workout fluidly and with flawless form.  Her voice is gentle and encouraging, and she provides detailed instruction on how to perform each movement, including attention to breathing.  There were a few times when I felt that she failed to adequately cue a change in movement, but once you've done the workout a few times, Karen is easy to follow.  She instructs alone with soft piano music in the background.  Overall, this is a challenging yet relaxing workout which will add some nice variety to your yoga practice for those beyond a beginner's level.",1073088000,17,1442,5.025210084033613

It's very concentrated and very effective. Great yoga workout that I can see myself doing for many years to come!
