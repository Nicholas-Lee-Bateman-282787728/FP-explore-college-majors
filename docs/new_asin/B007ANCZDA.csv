5072540,2,B007ANCZDA,"I've been interested in the bizarre 'Jungle Girl' genre lately. So I bought Inara as one of the more recent examples. I generally don't go out of my way to write a review on every film I've seen. Yet this film compelled me to do so.

Where to begin? Some folks are just going to say this a badly made film. That's both understatement and a bit too harsh. Obviously on some level this was a labor of love. And it seems to have been made by rather timid fanboys. They seemed completely amazed to get to lens skimpily attired women and have absolutely no idea what to do next.

The story? Girl discovers she an Amazon queen after living a pointless life in the 'real' world. There is a little room for a good story here. But very little room.

The plot? Now we know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall. It's astounding how often you just ask yourself ""Why is this happening?' 'How could that happen?' Why does Inara where hyper sexy clothes as part of her paramilitary unit. Why does the plane crash? Why do the women all where Maybelline eyeshadow in the jungle? Why is there no nudity yet so much suggestion of titillation? And even finally how could Inara remember her mother when she was still in swaddling cloths? And I could list inconsistencies all night long. Or just plain puzzles: Where do these women come from? Why are they all around the same age? Why are they so ethnically diverse? Why do they speak another language? And then they can also speak English? Do they reproduce? And how is it that they all went to yoga class together in the jungle?

Also we needed acres of exposition to grasp what in the world we were watching and we didn't get it. Except in one scene where a senior officer is explaining something for far too long.

Acting? The little girl did a little of it. After that? Wow. Someone mentioned that they used a bunch of female wrestlers. I can believe it. Where did they get those names? Cali Danger. Destiny Dumon. Empress Sayuri. Now dear Cali could actually turn into an actress. There is something fascinating about her. But in order to do that she's really going to need help from the director, she didn't get any here.

Directing? When? It's curious that with all of the DVD commentaries and special features these days that this director seems to have actually absorbed very little about the craft of directing. Scenes go on interminably without a drop of tension or interest. The final battle seems to have been run through once hastily. And why didn't these machine gun toting mercs just blast away? Why did they fight them with machetes? Okay so let's say you do have a final hand to hand battle, I don't remember seeing a drop of blood. And what was the point of the whole film? Was it a vaguely politically correct jungle movie about female empowerment? Since when are jungle movies ever politically correct? That's the reason they are interesting.

Now apart from the bad directing, acting, music (don't even get me started) etc there were a couple of good points. First of all occasionally the cinematography was good. In fact it made the women stand out in the lush greens and nighttime shots. It's a shame they didn't have anything to do. Also Cali Danger may not be much of an actress yet. Nevertheless she has some odd charisma, she needs to find a better project. Evidently this film was conceived and shot in North Carolina. Two cheers for the regional filmmaking and marketing. And they have marketed their little film with more moxy than went into the actual filming.

And finally I believe that in ten to twenty years from now this film will be a cult film of the so-bad-it's-funny category. I found myself hollering at the screen, something I rarely do. And I can imagine that in some strange way this film will have a weird life of its own.

Perhaps one day someone will make a serious Jungle Girl movie? It hasn't happened yet.",1407456000,11,3896,4.5227272727272725
5072541,1,B007ANCZDA,"I saw this on as a rental on another site. These women are from a fetish pro wrestling company called ""Ring Divas"" that glorify sex and men beating up women. They have ZERO acting skills. Bad script. Don't waste your time.",1399334400,,222,4.439024390243903

5072543,5,B007ANCZDA,"From the beginning to the end this movie was a treat. The site of all of those girls dancing around the fire was a treat within itself. But that aside, there was a young lady that could steal anyone's heart! Her character did just that to this film, gave it heart. There is some butt-kickin' to be appreciate in this movie as well. This director has a tasteful eyes and the proper skills that could possible take him to Hollywood in the very near future!",1378166400,6,454,4.352941176470588
5072544,2,B007ANCZDA,"Movie had nice scenery and great-looking women, but a plot skimpier than the jungle clothes the women wore.  The plot was poorly developed and the plot half-baked.  Save yourself the $15 and just watch the trailer, which shows all that you will to see and is barely expanded upon in the 70 min+ film.",1361059200,14,300,4.537037037037037
5072545,5,B007ANCZDA,"Inara, The Jungle Girl is a direct-to-DVD film that sets the bar for fans of classic Grindhouse/B-movie favourites. Inara(Internet model Cali Danger)is a brooding, self-hating Army sergeant who is forced to join a group of mercenaries who hates her to an island in South America to steal precious resources. After being attacked by her comrades, Inara had found herself in the jungle and being caught by a race of strong, beautiful, but vindictive warrior-women, all led by their lovely, but strong-willed Queen(Pin-up beauty Empress Sayuri). Convinced that she is not a threat to the women-warriors, Inara becomes a member of their tribe. When youngest member of the Tribe, a orphaned little amazon girl, is murdered by the evil mercenaries, Inara is enraged by the girl's death and leads her newfound sisters into a violent bloodletting against the ruthless soldiers. The only special features in this DVD is a synopsis of the film and the website for the studio who made this film. Most of the cast are just no-names and the women-warriors were portrayed by actresses who appeared in soft-core porn movies and other B-movies. Inara, The Jungle Girl is one film any fan of barely-clothed strong women movies will enjoy!!! :)",1354752000,10,1226,5.074257425742574
