8602728,5,B00E8RVQIG,This is a 3 pack of camp sci-fi films from the early 90's or so. They are on 3 separate discs and include commentary and trailers. Personally I loved Oblivion and Bad Channels and could live without Laserblast...which was more of a fire blast anyway. Decent restoration. There is no nudity in the films and limited swearing. (Bad Channels had three f-bombs which were deliberate and emphasized.) I have written individual reviews for each film under their title.,1443830400,,462,4.935897435897436
