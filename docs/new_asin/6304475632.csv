7872626,5,6304475632,The entire hercules movie series is an intriguing thrillfest perfectly designed to bring fun back to television. I really hope its success lures writers and producers to kill off these stupid reality shows and bring entertainment back to televison. I am forced to rent movies now that there is normally never anything compelling to watch other than cop and law shows.,1071705600,,367,5.032786885245901
7872627,5,6304475632,"Antony Quinn plays Zeus, Kevin Sorbo the mighty Hercules. Add Renee  O'Connor (pre Gabrielle, side kick to Xena) in this early episode that  helped to make Hercules The Legendary Journeys into a series. When war  threatens, Hercules pledges to save  Troy from attack. But, Hera who bares  no love for Hercules, hides the city. The only way to find the land is by  using a magical compass that will reveal its coordinates. Giving a helpful  preview, Renee O'Connor plays a rescued innocent who sort of helps in the  quest. Great fun, punny humor, wonderful cast, and the magic of Hercules'  unique style.",968025600,3,603,4.833333333333333
