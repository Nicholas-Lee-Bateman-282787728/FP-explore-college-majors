8366819,5,B000K15WJ8,"The laughs are numerous in this bag of mixed nuts! AND SO IT GOES features a series of film shorts and comedy sketches spanning from 1992 to 2006!

First go back in time in the old style silent movie ""Love on a Stick"" and watch as Charlie tries everything to get a girl's attention. Then the laughs will fly as we peek into a heated therapy session between husband and wife in ""Mr. and Mrs. Hall"". Also watch the commercial for the new amusement park ""Moron Land"" and then things take a dramatic turn in ""Porcelain Face"" where the entire story is done to a poem about a man who sees the woman of his dreams and then must decide if he should talk to her or just walk on by.

There's so much more in a movie that has something for everyone. Enjoy!",1164585600,,745,4.166666666666667
