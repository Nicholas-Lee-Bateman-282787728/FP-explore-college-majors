6225477,5,B00HUTPJY6,"I saw this documentary recently on PBS and liked it so much that I bought my own copy.

The dome that Filippo Brunelleschi built on the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Flore in Florence is an architectural and engineering masterpiece. As stated in the DVD package write up It's ""still the largest masonry dome on earth after more than six centuries. It is taller than the Statue of Liberty and weighs as much as an average cruise ship.""

The technology to build the dome was unknown at the time it was commissioned but Brunelleschi devised a way to do it. Modern engineers would have difficulty replicating Brunelleschi's dome with modern construction technology. Unfortunately, Brunelleschi left no written record of how it was done so his construction methods have long been debated by engineers, architects and historians.

This DVD proposes a very compelling theory of how Brunelleschi actually did it. It also gives a very interesting history of Filippo Brunelleschi and the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Flore. This is an excellent DVD for anyone interested in history, art, architecture or engineering. A very well done DVD on a very interesting subject.",1397433600,20,1157,5.047120418848167
6225478,5,B00HUTPJY6,"Largest masonry dome in the world was built some 600 years ago with over four million bricks and mortar, weighting over 40,000 ton by a goldsmith with no experience in architecture or construction next to creations of Leonardo da Vinci and Michael de Angelo where scientist are still trying to figure the secrets of the dome over five decades. Amazing to say the least. Bravo.",1393632000,12,376,4.8

8636063,4,B00HUTPJY6,"Good explanation of the wonder of Brunelleschi's dome. How did he do it?

 ""It was impossible, or should have been, at that time.""

Explains the decades of work of an Italian scholar searching for Brunelleschi's method.

Covers briefly Brunelleschi's life, from his youth as a goldsmith, to his travel to Rome studying the ancient buildings. Persuaded Florence to commission him to construct the dome on this church.

The church had already been under construction for hundred years!

When started no one knew how to put on the dome. Now was the time. How? City fathers opened the bids. Brunelleschi won. The work took sixteen years.

Amazing!

One point I learned was that some scholars start the Renaissance with this dome. Changed the attitude of Italy (Europe) from feeling inferior to the ancients, to assuming superiority. Huge change.

Easy to follow and interesting. Only one hour.",1449964800,6,889,5.075862068965518
