7822190,5,6302181518,This film should prove what a good actor this man is. He plays a tough Marine held captive and a high school football coach who comes looking for his missing brother. He does double duty in this film. AND he does all the stunts for both parts!,1242864000,3,243,4.191489361702128
7822191,4,6302181518,"I enjoyed this movie quite a lot. A decent plot, a few surprises and some entertaining characters. But don't forget that this really IS a B-movie so don't expect ""Gone With The Wind"". There is a lot of good action scenes, and the lead character (Twice over) finds himself with his very own helpful cabbie without whom, he would probably not have survived. Pare` goes to what looks like an Islamic country or Israel ( I am not versed in reading the language painted on the walls..) to ""save"" his twin brother who, by government standards, has been killed. The fact that his character is a high school coach, makes him in to the typical ""fish out of water"" and gets him in dangerous trouble. With trusted cabbie at his side.. he preservers  making for a bit of fun, a lot of action and a good ending. Give it a try, I think you will enjoy it. If your a Michael Pare` fan, you will love it.",1215129600,4,887,4.311377245508982
