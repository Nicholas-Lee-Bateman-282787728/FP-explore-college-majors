7452009,5,B015SE2S5C,"Even though I have practiced Yoga for years, this beginner DVD is a fabulous reminder of the correct way to perform many yoga poses. Alanna has a grace and ease about her that is infectious. The video is relaxing and uplifting at the same time. Her I AM statements but you in a state of balance that can only be acheived by Yoga.  I will do this video again and again to keep my yoga practice in a state of gratitude to my breath and body. Alanna delivers everything I think yoga teaches us - to explore and appreciate the light within us through breath and movement.  The pace is slow enough to be effective and not so slow to be boring. It is a real flow ending in a wonderful guided mediation.  I am so glad Alanna produced such a wonderful video!  Bravo and Namaste.",1452297600,15,770,4.2534246575342465
7452010,5,B015SE2S5C,"By far one of the best DVD's for a yogi beginner like me. I have been practicing yoga for about a month now with this DVD.  I absolutely look forward to rolling out my yoga mat, popping in this DVD and getting my morning yoga fix.  Alanna's positive energy and yoga flow is easy to follow.  My 67 year old mother was so impressed with Alanna's instruction that she is now joining me every morning.. Soooooo happy see my mother active in yoga.",1452124800,4,442,4.301204819277109
7452011,5,B015SE2S5C,"New to practicing yoga, I loved this DVD. The instruction is easy to follow to achieve the pose correctly. Alanna has a calming voice, so I felt very relaxed and am looking forward to my next session ! This will definitely be part of my excessive routine!",1452124800,,255,4.446808510638298
7452012,5,B015SE2S5C,I've tried yoga before and always gave up because of my back...could never lay down....I like this because you don't lay down all of the time...for the first time in my 60 plus years I can...thank you!  it has helped my posture and breathing...,1452124800,3,244,4.545454545454546
7452013,3,B015SE2S5C,"This is an okay DVD for a beginner.  I have lots of Element Yoga: Ashley Turner, Mia Togo, and Elena Brower.  This dvd does not offer anything new from prior Element Yoga dvds.  Alanna has a pleasant enough voice but the warmup (about 6 minutes) and the cool down (about 5 minutes of corpse pose) are too long for me.  That leaves only about 21 min for actual workout.",1451692800,4,368,4.2898550724637685
7452014,5,B015SE2S5C,"I have done both of these Beginner Level Yoga practice sessions (32 minutes each) this week. They are both different and excellent for a beginner!

I really liked Alannas soothing voice and detailed directions on what to do before each yoga pose. The background was so serene and peaceful-I loved looking at it during both yoga practice sessions.

Typically I only have the patience and desire to do Yoga for 15-20 minutes so I wasn't sure if I would want to do the full 32 minutes of each practice. Both practices went by fast for me because of the constant, flowing movements and how relaxed I felt listening to Alannas instructions.

The first yoga practice is called the Foundations Program. This is easier than the second one because it goes a little slower and has very simple standing and sitting movements.

The second practice is called the Slow Flow Program. This one was nice and flowing from one exercise to another. There were different poses than in the first practice. I liked this one the best because I have some experience with doing yoga and found this one more challenging.

I think either of these would be perfect to do first thing in the morning or right before bed.

My husband and I did the 10 minute meditation. Please note that this is a guided mediation which means she talks during the entire thing which I liked. I didn't like that its a sitting meditation. I was able to sit for half of it before I had to lay down because my back was bothering me so much. I was trying really hard to sit up straight that I had a hard time focusing on what she was saying through my discomfort. Next time I will do this 10 minute segment laying down like my husband did.

I received a complimentary copy of this DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment in exchange for an honest review on my blog and social media-all opinions are my own.",1451692800,12,1846,4.492537313432836
7452015,5,B015SE2S5C,"If you are new to Yoga, as I am, then look no further.  Gentle, clear and athletic Alanna's instruction guided me into a world that I have been wanting to discover for some time now. Hooked and now a daily practitioner this wonderful video is a must for any aspiring Yogi!

7452026,4,B015SE2S5C,"This is a very good Yoga DVD.  There are 3 routines that are about 20 minutes each and enjoyable to do.  It would be better if there were 2 sound tracks to choose from like Rodney Yee has on one of his yoga DVD's.  One track that has all the inspirational messages she has to say and one that just leads you through the poses.

7452032,5,B015SE2S5C,"After taking a few introductory yoga classes and eventually quitting, I felt too intimidated to go to another class and bought this instead. This video is very helpful for beginners to yoga especially if you're feeling self-conscious about postures and poses.

The focus of this video is core, fundamental poses in Hatha Yoga and gives you enough of a routine that you can eventually do on your own. I followed this video for weeks before doing it on my pwn and found the lessons and tips really stuck with me.

Well worth the time and investment.",1484179200,8,547,4.6875
7452033,5,B015SE2S5C,"This DVD is perfect for beginners. I have experimented with yoga in the past, but every practice I tried was too hard and the instructor wasn't very good. Alanna takes you through both practices in such a way that even when you can't see the screen, you can still do the poses. Now, I will mention that I have been doing dance related workouts for the past five years and have built up my core strength which may give me an advantage over a complete beginner, but I stand by my opinion that this is a great DVD for beginners. I feel so good at the end of the practice and when I don't have time to do it more than once or twice a week, I miss it and can tell that I need to do it again because I'm out of alignment (which sounds crazy but it's true!).",1477008000,4,751,4.013333333333334

I also have a bad back and achy body. When doing this routine, I can feel it in my back and entire body but I can actually do the things she is! I think my aches and pains are going to improve the longer I do this routine! I'm really, really, really happy with this!!!",1473811200,5,426,3.852272727272727
7452038,4,B015SE2S5C,"I have only used the one of the two classes in this DVD nad it was pretty good. a tad bit rushed but nothing that I couldn't follow.

7452041,5,B015SE2S5C,"I think I own most of the Element yoga DVDs, and I don't think I've ever been disappointed.  This is probably one of my favorites because it's so positive.  Alanna's affirmations are uplifting. I've done some DVDs with affirmations, and at the time, I found them more annoying than helpful. In this DVD, her delivery is sincere and it's a positive experience.

Like the other Element DVDs, it's set outside, in a beautiful garden near a pool and what looks like the ocean in the distance.

The music is soft and relaxing.

Alanna's cuing is excellent.  I never had to look to see what she was doing.  I also liked that she used Sanskrit and English. To me, yoga is like ballet in that the language of the form should be used.

I chose to do the flow sequence first, followed by the meditation.  Both were very nice.  The foundations sequence is also very well done.

If you're looking for your first yoga DVD, and you're a beginner or fairly new to yoga, this this is a great choice.  If you're buying this for a beginner yogi, I highly recommend it.

After doing this DVD, I'm now wanting to go back and reread her book.",1468800000,3,1121,4.409756097560976

As I get older, I am starting to feel my flexiblity, balance and range of motion decreasing.  It seemed that yoga could help with all three of these issues.  Not knowing where to start, I decided to purchase this beginner level dvd to give yoga a try.  I must say that I am pleasantly surprised by the superb instruction in this yoga routine.  I liked the calming and encouraging instructor's voice telling me that sometimes ""less is more.""  I never felt lost or discouraged while using this on the first try.  It is a total of 78 minutes, and is broken down into three segments including a guided meditation.  If you are looking for great beginner instruction, Element Beginner Yoga is a must have.

I've done several classes and have a good amount of strength & flexibility, but my mom is a complete beginner. This was EXACTLY what I was looking for.  The instructions were clear enough for a beginner like my Mom to follow, and the programs flowed well from pose to pose. And while I'm not a beginner, I found it fun and still challenging enough to provide me a good workout.  The instructor provided great tips & comments so you can tailor the poses to your own strengths and abilities.",1453766400,4,574,4.457142857142857
7452055,5,B015SE2S5C,"This DVD is truly amazing. I am brand new to yoga and I ordered three Element beginner DVD's. This is the one I highly recommend. Others are great too, but this one is amazing. Sometimes it can be overwhelming to start something new that you know nothing about. In this DVD the instructor Alanna takes it slow and explains the poses in such a helpful way. She explains each and every detail of the pose, including where you should be looking, etc. I am so appreciative of her detailed descriptions and instructions. It makes a huge difference and helps you to truly understand how to do the poses correctly. She moves slowly which is exactly what a beginner needs. I have confidence that as I am learning the poses, I am learning them correctly, which sets the foundation for the rest of my yoga practice in the future. Super important to me. Alanna also includes positive affirmations as you go along which is wonderful. I felt amazing after my first practice and I am excited to continue.

This DVD also includes a bonus guided mediation which is also amazing. I am new to yoga, but I have practiced meditation a bit in the past and I found the guided meditation very positive and relaxing. I am so thrilled with this purchase and I truly highly recommend this DVD for beginners. Amazing.",1452902400,53,1290,4.584415584415584

8734518,5,B015SE2S5C,I really like this video and more importantly Alanna Zabel's ease In teaching those who never took yoga.

8734523,2,B015SE2S5C,"This is not as much for a beginner as I would have liked. The music is calming as is the voice-over work. However, the video gets very low marks for this reason: the voice-over work does not match the physical movements of the on-screen demonstrator. For example, there are moments when the narrator says ""lift your left arm"" and the demonstrator lifts her right arm. Then, without skipping a beat, the narrator says ""move your left leg"" and the demonstrator moves her left leg. This inconsistent style of demonstration is as frustrating as it is confusing.",1515974400,,557,4.8125
