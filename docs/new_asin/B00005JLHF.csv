1530633,4,B00005JLHF,"After seeing the trailer for 'They', than the trailer for 'Darkness Falls', you could easily tell they were almost the same. I personally think that They was A LOT better than Darkness Falls. I mean, Darkness Falls even ...the idea of 'night terrors' from They. Anyone can tell that.
Anyway, enough of my ""venting"". I thought They was an excellant horror movie. It is SO much better than what's out there today, not to mention the ill-fated DARKNESS FALLS! (you can see my anger) It had such a simple plot, but did so much with it. The atmosphere was excellant, and it actually had character develeopment! That is something you hardly ever see in a horror movie. It also had a lot of suspense and pop-out scares. I mean, at one part the whole theatre let out one big shriek. Now that's what I call a scare. The acting is also very goodand beliveable.
I personally reccomend you renting They first because it's one of those movies where you like it or you don't.",1051660800,,961,4.528735632183908
1530634,4,B00005JLHF,"I would agree that some of the acting in this is terrible, as the pace really changes mid-stream in the film, so does the quality of performances.  This is a movie so divised that I almost would have to critique as two separate parts.  The first half is slightly ridiculous, dull, wooden acting, vapid characters, yet somehow the film manages to set a very clear tone -and this movie is all about tone!  As the pace picks up and the actors shift gears, I found myself really immersed in the thick as fog sense of dread.  Straying away from explicit violence and an emphasis on atmosphere and haunted house bump in the night chills-this movie really will get to you!  Horror movies often more than any other genre demand the viewer be pro-active about suspending disbelief and ""going with it"".  Turn off the lights, grab some popcorn, and have some fun getting scared. When I saw this movie in the theater a woman on 4 or 5 occasions literally shrieked at the top of her lungs and ran out the theater (still screaming!).  That's a good sign.",1049241600,,1040,4.529411764705882
1530810,3,B00005JLHF,"Not an epic, ""keep you awake for days"" movie, but worth watching if you're looking for a non-gory, mostly clean language, not a ton of t&a (one full on back nude, very brief) horror flick.",1411084800,,188,4.4
1530811,4,B00005JLHF,This is a great horror movie.  I gave it four stars because of the ending.  I love endings that are happy or hopeful.  Not a fan of endings where no one wins,1409270400,,157,3.84375

1530813,1,B00005JLHF,"THEY are part of one of the worst movies I have seen in years. I'm not even sure who THEY are! Usually Wes Craven doesn't put his name on something unless it's decent. This isn't even close to decent. This is the slowest, most boring horror film I've ever seen! ""Hey remember that thing that scared us 19 years ago, when we were kids, well all of a sudden it's back, so ummm call your childhood psychologist."" Laura Regan is laughable, getting more upset by some crap on her finger than her friend blowing his head off in front of her, and it's just downhill from there. There is nothing scary about this film. I really have to question how s*** like this even gets made.",1361577600,,671,4.333333333333333
1530814,4,B00005JLHF,"Love, Love, Love this movie!! I saw it at the theater when it first came out and thought it was okay.
I then watched it a year or two ago and really liked it better.
Now, I just finished watching it again, in my living room, lights off, fan humming, and...wow!
I'm in love!
The movie is all about mood and atmosphere,so,to truly feel its vibe, you need to tune out the world for 90 minutes and just let it take you.
If your talking, getting up, eating...whatever, forget feeling the magic of the film.
If your looking for a quick scare, don't hold your breath.
What your watching is really designed to be just one long, feverish nightmare.
Sure, it's got a Freddy-Fever thing going on and it's virtually a remake of 'Don't be afriad of the Dark' with actress Laura Regan filling Kim Darby's shoes.
But the sleepy style has it's own little 'creepy crawly' thing going on. If you are a true horror movie fan, someone who thinks outside of the box, you will at least appreciate the tension weaved through each scene and the film-nor like flavor.
What also helps is the outstanding cast. Laura Regan may not be, in my opinion, a great actress but she sure does look strange and haunted throughout the film. (not to mention that she has one helluva long neck!) She was also in another little film called 'My little Eye' and she looked just as spooked in that one. Good movie by the way!
I also love Ethan Embry! He's so bizarre, but adorable at the same time. I'm surprised he hasn't made a name for himself, commercially that is. He's really a fantastic actor. He's been in so many off-beat movies like,Dutch, Empire Records, and Disturbing Behavior, just to name a few. He's really awesome to watch......
and another thing, even though I'm not into alternate
endings found on many DVDS as a special feature (I feel one solid ending is all I need. I hate when the producers feel as if I need to see 'another conclusion' to the story. All it reminds me of is that what I just watched was a commercial product and more than one hand was mixing the stew. It's like I just witnessed a 'choose your own adventure story' which is rather lame. I recall the movie 'Joyride' having more than three endings on the DVD. Come on!? Talk about loosing the magic of what I just watched. Yuck!
However, in this case,the alternate ending is pretty cool and doesn't really take away from the first one.
But I really, really liked the theatrical ending, compared to the 'Wizard of Oz' like finale.
Great stuff here Wes! Goosebumps for sure! I'm a huge avid movie lover,especially horror, I live and breath this stuff. And I will have to say, 'Wes Craven's They' is a nice little creepy dark ride. If...you let loose yourself feel the vibe.
My favorite all time movie, the one that made me fall in love with film, is, Tobe Hooper's The FUNHOUSE. sO, I'm all about dark style and ambiance, and that film has it in spades.....however, that's for another time to talk about it.",1338249600,,2950,4.485130111524164
1530815,4,B00005JLHF,"Remember Mia Farrow in Rosemary's Baby?  Of course you do.  That was one of the greatest horror movie performances of all time.  Laura Regan in ""They"" has a definite Mia Farrow quality about her and I think that her performance in this film compares favorably to what Farrow was capable of in her prime.  In fact, all the performances in this film are uniformly excellent.

This is a film made with dedication and with class.  This movie was presumably accomplished quickly and cheaply but it was not done sloppily or cheesily. The goal for the director, the actors and the production staff was to craft a quality little horror movie that they would be proud to show to their friends as well as to their peers.  I appreciate the careful effort that they put into this movie and I hope they will all go on to bigger things and bigger budgets.

As is the case with nearly every horror movie ever made, the plot is the weakest link in the endeavor.  I couldn't even begin to speculate who ""They"" are.  The computer-generated creatures that we see emerging from the dark aren't very convincing or especially menacing.  It would have been better if ""They"" had been presented as black-on-black, hallucinatory shadows that can only be half-glimpsed and half-comprehended. The enigma of night terrors must be maintained.

The ending of this film isn't entirely satisfying because the plot itself is too muddled to lead up to a well-structured conclusion.  But I didn't hate the way the movie ends.  What happens is dark and surprising and I won't ever forget it.

Some people are happy if their horror flicks are stuffed with shocks and schlock and nothing else much matters to them.  But other people can appreciate the outstanding acting, directing and production design that goes into a movie like this one.  This film won't keep you up all night, but it will let you go to bed with a satisfied smile on your face.",1333929600,,1909,4.701807228915663
1530816,5,B00005JLHF,"My copy of this DVD broke (literally) and I went to Amazon to replace it.  Having seen this film back in '03 I was very surprised by the bad reviews.  I can't help but think that those reviews were from viewers that expect continual blood and gore to be the main component to a Horror film.

I thought this film was excellent.  It imparts a tangible feeling of suspense and fear of the unknown and, as noted by the bad reviews, the substance and motivation of that unknown is never discovered.  In a very real sense, this film inherits many of the traditional elements of Film Noir.  There is an evil out there....often related to something within the character (us)....but it is always ill-defined and the edge of recognition.  You know it is there, but can never see or touch it.  The use of lighting and camera angles to depict internal turmoil is classic Noir.  The opening scene with Billy, ss an adult, utilizes the interplay of light/dark and composition to evoke the inner turmoil of the character and is very nearly classical Noir. The plight of the main character, aware of her fate yet unable to alter the in-execrable conclusion, is classic mellodrama.  We follow the other characters through a similar deterioration and in a similar manner.  The effect is to bring the viewer into a world of fear, a world of fear without knowledge or understanding of what or why, and show us the impact on our psyche.  In a ""traditional"" American horror film, the characters who ""survive"" are often ""re-normalized"" and the film ends with a return to normalcy.  In this film, even if the characters had been spared their fate, it would have been hard to deny the inner deterioration and the resulting physcological scar.  I think it is the failure of this film to reassure us of the inevitability of the restoration of normalcy that makes it unnerving.  There is no ""happy ending"", the ""goods guys"" don't win, and, more the point, the victims do not prevail.

The bad reviews are not so much a commentary on the film, but on the American audience.  This is a film that does not deliver pre-digested, easy to comprehend, and easily forgotten content.  It does not reassure us, or tell us that we will prevail through strength of spirit or will.  It presents the deepest inner fears that each of us has had as a nightmare a child, undefinable and inescapable, and so is perhaps more disturbing than many care to acknowledge.

I think Craven has succeeded in applying the elements of Film Noir and mellodrama to the Horror genre and the result is well worth seeing.  While I don't think this is the best Horror film of all time, or anything like it, it is certainly a must-see and does not deserve these bad reviews.",1321056000,,2710,4.627615062761507

Oh this was so brutal, I'd rather enjoy watching Glenn Beck banging Rushy in a gay porno theater somewhere in Montreal.

1530819,4,B00005JLHF,"THEY are our childhood fears come into our adult lives. THEY hate light and live only in darkness. THEY have marked their victims as children, returning years later to take them away. THEY are creatures from a dimension of constant night. I really enjoyed this creeper! I watched it twice, once at normal brightness, then again w/ the brightness near 100%. The difference being that I could actually make out what was happening the second time around! THEY is a bleak film, intentionally muted and obscure. In reality, no one keeps rooms as dimly lit as the places in this movie! The story is interesting, the characters are believable in the context of the story, and the monsters are pretty cool. Check it out...",1286582400,2,714,4.766129032258065
1530918,2,B00005JLHF,"People are defending this movie?  I'm stumped, but whatever.  Not to knock anyone else's taste (who am I to judge) but this movie was one of those films that left me scratching my head, and not in a good way.  I know that Jeff Shannon's review states that it is a subtle shocker; one that is `creepily engrossing' but I found it just plain boring, and rather stupid.  This was the trend in the early 00's though; blast out a billion of these PG-13 horror films to capitalize on the success of that 99 ghost movie (yes, I'm playing the `...Sixth Sense' card again, but it fits so why not) and see how much money we can make off of an overdone plot point.  This film just doesn't offer anything new or exciting.  The plot is under worked and the scares (I know that the reviewer makes it sound like a good thing that the film isn't `in your face' scary, but isn't that the point of a horror film?) are nearly non-existent; and when they come they are generic and borderline laughable.

Seriously, stay away from this dud.

To feign sounding ignorant to those who claim that I just don't `get it'; I want to make it clear that the concept here is actually one I find rather intriguing.  I mean, the idea that our fears are shaped by the ambiguous ones that plagued our childhood is pretty ingenious, and the concept of shaping a film around those ever-shape-shifting fears is one that could have worked gloriously; I just find the films construction and delivery to be lacking in some very key areas.  It just doesn't come together like it should have.  But, maybe the concept is too vague to work when you think about it.  Some things that work on an intellectual level can't work from an entertainment perspective, and I fear that that issue comes into play here.  The movie-going public likes resolutions.  They like to know what they rooting for and or rooting against.  Keeping things so vague and mysterious can become frustrating and irritating when the resolution is swept out from under us.

We like to be `guessing', but we also like to be told if we are `right'.

I just think this film fell completely apart and needed to be reworked and maybe even completely scrapped.  Instead, what seems like a brilliant concept becomes a forgettable and at time laughable reminder that Hollywood can only make the same film so many ways so many times before it becomes a statistic.",1284681600,3,2378,4.542253521126761
1530919,2,B00005JLHF,"So, I bought this at some yard sale for a buck (I think). It certainly wasn't much...and not much of a film either. I wasn't impressed and not scared one bit. Specifically, when I saw the PG-13 and from ""Dimension"", I knew I'd be disappointed.

Laura Regan, the main actress, did well with the material and was the only character I was interested in a bit. Her and some other folks all theorized that this mark somewhere on their body was from their childhood, when something that lurked in the dark apparently tried to get them. Those with the mark meant that something was coming to complete their accquisition. Why did THEY wait so long? Was their anything about these people that made them want them specifically? I guess that it's just that they all had night terrors as a child and THEY liked that. Maybe it made them easier to be taken or something.

Why would the mark suddenly appear on the soon-to-be victims? On the main character, how could a giant splinter not even be noticeable in her head -- even if the mark couldn't be seen yet? Why could THEY be able to appear in the light at the end and take the lady to some kind of spooky dimension? What made them able to turn off lights?

Heck...one of the most interesting parts, to me, was when the psychologist asked the patient, who was in college to be a psychologist, to analyze herself.

The alternate ending -- the lone extra feature on the DVD -- was cooler. In that, she was a psychiatric patient since childhood and the entire movie was her schizophrenic delusion. Some of the other patients were, in the movie, different characters in her mind. For example, her own psychologist was shown in a chair getting medicine.

This should have been the ending; it would have been a bit neater. I figure that a person with a major mental illness could be forgiven for having 'plot holes' in the delusions. It must have also been a in-the-mind creation that Wes Craven presented this; he's not listed anywhere on the package except for above the title of the movie. What did he do?",1272326400,,2041,4.520325203252033
1530920,4,B00005JLHF,"'THEY' is one of those horror flicks I love so much, regardless if it has Wes Craven's name slapped on it.  It's weird, if this flick didn't play out the ""don't-go-to-sleep bit"", it wouldn't have seemed like a Wes Craven flick at all.  Maybe that's why so many people (even Wes Craven fans), hate it, because 'THEY' doesn't answer all the questions and leaves a lot of mystery for use viewers to wonder.  Yet, Wes Craven is willing to support this film.  In Wes Craven's films, that's very uncommon to see.  I admit, I can be one of those that just has to have all the answers. haha.  Anyway, I really don't judge a movie by who's behind it or who is in support of it.

This story is also a perfect example of why it's good to have some things unanswered!  It makes it fun for me when I get to use my imagination about the 'night creatures', the victims, where 'THEY' come from, and what 'THEIR' overall purpose is!  It makes me want to create my own comic book that would be based on answering these questions!  Sometimes it's no fun to have a film that answers all the questions; it's good to have a horror film that allows you think why things are the way they are!  This is by far not the first horror film to exercise this idea.  It seems that most of the younger generation have forgotten that older horror stories thrived on this style back then.  Also, I admit that I was one of few who liked it but one of the many who had forgotten about it.  This flick came out in 02'; it wasn't till 07', when I remembered it and had suddenly got the urge to seek it out haha.

Overall great little creeper with awesome looking creatures!",1263340800,6,1634,4.259740259740259
1530921,2,B00005JLHF,"Apparently being afraid of the dark means not being able to actually SEE anything in the dark, according to the writers of this film.

""They"" is a terrible movie.  The acting is decent enough, the emotions from the characters whenever something bizarre or sad happens is believable (most of the time) but the biggest problem with this film is that it was completely boring.  Not interesting for a single second until the final 5 minutes.

Yes that's right- over an hour and 20 goes by and THEN something interesting happens.  The ending is pretty good, but the story throughout the movie should have focused on what eventually happened to the woman instead of waiting until the VERY end to show it.  How much longer were we expected to wait until something interesting happens?  The writers should have focused on what ended up happening to the young woman for the other characters in the movie.

The signs that something horrible was about to happen to certain people by a blood mark appearing somewhere on their body was more along the lines of bad and lazy writing instead of interesting ""what's going to happen next?"" story-telling.  Whenever something bad was about to happen to the characters (such as the woman who was swimming in the dark) the actual suspense honestly wasn't there at ALL almost the entire time.  The only good part (besides the ending) was the guy in the restaurant who had a gun in the beginning of the movie (I won't spoil what happened here).

Plus the entire movie was completely dark (like I mention above in the opening line).  So dark you couldn't see the monsters, and couldn't even see the film.  Dark for the sake of darkness.  Bad movie.",1250121600,,1674,4.707903780068729

1530923,3,B00005JLHF,"Must say that I disagree with the reviewer above about the movie being branded as 'trash'.  Yes, as crazy as they do so often come, and there are those moments in the movie, that merit that, mind you, there is also some very totally uncommon spiritual components too, that may be easily over looked.  The ever determined, simi-militant minded, ex-Air force, mountaineer and his patient, free-spirited girl friend find themselves trapped and eventually driven to the point of near destitute measures to secure survival at such odds along with their John Denver-looking, hippie friend who just so happens to have a soft spot for UFO's and a knack for joking around.  The other two fellows are hardly noticeable accept in their frustrations.  I apologize if I can't recall their exact names to mention here but their character roles speak for that.  (The mountaineer bares a distant resemblance to Stiffler from Road Trip (1998))  And at some point late in the movie he admits that in spite of not being cut out for the military, he begins to fathom his very existence or how long he has left.  Their hippie friend seems to keep his cool throughout the duration of the suspense and his pranking whims keep his continence afloat.  The hammond organ and some of the kitsch electro-sound effects is what really contributes to this movie and keeps the tone sneaky and sinister at the same time while there is a signature sound of genuine Folk-mountain melody, warm yet uncertain.  Amid the cheesy smoke balls, the tacky concave disks that we're supposed to believe as being extra-terrestrial, the struggle, in itself, never strays away from being on point. It is practically the whole emphasis here.  But perhaps at the end of the movie when we are at a lose for what is about to happen and having to wait so long, two kindred souls seem to be brought together and a creepy, message seems to evoke almost like: they who persevere in spirit lived on while those that existed on impulse fell behind.

1530925,4,B00005JLHF,"Legendary horror film director Wes Craven has created a very scary and psychologically thrilling movie where frightening childhood fears become real.

The movie begins with a young boy lying in his bed during a thunderstorm.  The boy tells his mother that he's afraid.  But, his mother reassures him that everything will be fine.  However, everything turns out very wrong, and something grabbed the child.

Fast forward 19 years.  Julia (Laura Regan) is a young psychology Master's degree candidate.  She is out on a date with her boyfriend Paul (Marc Blucas) when she gets a frantic phone call from Billy (Jon Abrahams).  Billy and Julia were childhood friends and both suffered from ""night terrors"".  Julia agrees to meet with Billy; much to the chagrin of Paul.  Upon arriving, Julia notices the bad condition Billy is in.  He begins babbling incoherently about ""They""; the creatures that tormented him as a child.  This babbling goes on for several minutes until Billy pulls out a gun and kills himself right in front of Julia.

A few days later at the funeral, Julia meets two other friends of Billy: Sam (Ethan Embry) and Terry (Dagmara Dominczyk).  They too suffered from the same night terrors that Billy and Julia did. After talking for a while, Julia learned that Billy, Sam, and Terry suffered with nightmares well into college.  Each also displayed a  strange mark on their skin.  Billy also kept a journal, and Sam has become engrossed in each entry.  The marks on the skin are believed to be something left behind by the creatures so that they could come back later and collect them.

Sure enough, Sam and Terry are ""collected"".  Julia, fearing that she might have the mark, asks Paul to check.  Finding nothing, Julia begins to feel somewhat better.  However, Paul didn't check everywhere and soon, Julia is suffering from her own new set of night terrors.  Is all of this in her head, as her psychologist expects, or is she really convinced that ""They"" are coming back for her?

This is a very good movie.  It took a while for me to get into the plot, but after a short time, I became engrossed in the film.  The plot is expertly designed around the nightmares of children, and its something everyone can relate to.

I highly recommend this movie.  Wes Craven does a good job of building on the childhood nightmare experience, and he expertly weaves it into a very scary movie.  By the way, the ending is by far the best part of the movie.  Don't miss this fine psychological thriller.",1197936000,,2501,4.748837209302326

It has been noted that we aren't told just what these creatures are all about. That is what makes the whole thing so eerie. That atmosphere puts you in the same uncomfortable position as the characters/victims here. It just adds to the overwhelming sense of weirdness and fear that grips them.

Wes Craven isn't actually the director (that honor belonging to Robert Harmon and Rick Bota), so his connection to the film is tenuous at best.  Besides, these days, Craven's name on horror movies isn't necessarily a plus.

They's plot is simple: boogeymen are real (maybe) and they mark human children for kidnapping and eating later.

Or something like that. We follow the life of willowy Julia Lund (Laura Regan), a graduate student preparing to defend her thesis on psychology.  With her long neck and bowl cut, Lund has a compelling screen presence; she's especially good at welling up with tears at a whim.

Two men orbit our heroine, her EMT boyfriend Paul Loomis (Marc Blucas) and her childhood male friend Billy Parks (Jon Abrahams). The boyfriend is something of an anomaly; he's a medical professional that lives with his two shlub roommates. Understandably, Julia doesn't want to sleep over...although she does anyway, despite the fact one of the idiot roommates walks in on her naked. More on the sleeping arrangements later.

Billy is a wreck.  He has a history of drug use and paranoia, and when rolling blackouts threaten to roll across the city (which I think is New York, but was never sure), he totally flips out.  Billy is convinced that the things that go bump in the night are out to get him, and eventually, poor Julia.  Why they're out to get Billy NOW, as opposed to say, when they originally tagged him in the beginning of the movie as a child, we have no idea.  Billy prattles on about how both he and Julie suffered from ""night terrors"" as children and that the things causing the night terrors have returned to collect them.  Speaking of which, night terrors are integral to the plot but never adequately explained. The frantic conversation ends with Billy committing suicide in front of Julia by shooting himself in the head.

Understandably distraught, Julia visits Billy's funeral, where she meets two other victims.  One of them, Sam Burnside (Ethan Embry), is an artist who chain-smokes and paints really crappy pictures.  The other roommate, Terry Alba (played by sultry Dagmara Dominczyk), doesn't seem to do anything but speak with a strange accent and walk around in a swimsuit.  It's obvious from the start that both of these folks are doomed.

All of the characters seem to have difficulty finding someone to share their bed with, despite even Julia having a steady boyfriend.  When her boyfriend does sleep over, he sleeps in a separate room for reasons that are never explained.  And yet, Julia has no problem sleeping in her boyfriend's bed (you know, the one with the two loud roommates who walk in on her naked). Sorry, if I was freaked that things might eat me at night, I'd find a bedmate, even if it was only a platonic bedmate.  Sam and Terry seem like perfect candidates for just such an arrangement, but they of course split up...

They tries really hard to scare us without scaring us, relying on creatures half-seen.  I couldn't help but feel cheated; I really wanted to see some cool monster effects.  We never get that much.  Instead, we get a lot of information: THEY cannot abide the light, THEY can cause electrical devices to go out, and THEY tag humans as children with long slivers of bone.  It's almost like an alien abduction scenario, only THEY are interdimensional kidnappers.

They suffers from the same problem as Silent Hill; the heroine doesn't really have a realistic chance of fighting back against the bad guys.  Instead, she's relegated to running, screaming, and then more running into really stupid places like subways.  The rolling blackout threat never seems to come to pass; I had visions of the entire city being overrun as the lights went out. But no such luck, this is Julia's story and hers alone.

The ending is grim and particularly unsatisfying.  The alternate ending on the DVD was much bolder and certainly excused the flimsy plot.  But unfortunately, the directors balked (or maybe it was good old Wes) and we end up with a standard plot with standard monsters and standard victims.

For all its flaws, They is still a pretty good creepfest.  It's just not a very satisfying movie, and after awhile the heroine's histrionics become irritating enough that you start rooting for the monsters to eat her.",1158105600,,4414,4.811671087533156

Let me just say the CGI effects were juvenile, ridiculous, and a shame to look at. THEY is a story about children who have night terrors (which are really creatures), and the kids turning up missing, then come back, then 20 years down the road a strange mark starts showing up, therefore meaning that the beasties in the closet are marking their victims to come and get them at a later date, kind of like the USDA stamping the choice steaks. Why they don't keep the kids when they are young, who knows, maybe the boogeyman didn't want to listen to Zooboomafoo and the Wiggles. A psychology student, Laura Regan, (whose acting ranges from quiet concerned waif, to waif staring at a large pizza with horror, to waif in denial of Atkins going bankrupt) is one of the children who had night terrors/bogeyman kidnapping and her friend(who also had them) offs himself in front of her because he cant handle it anymore. The monsters make little clicking noises curiously echoing the Judas bug from Mimic, anyway they look like...well they look like computer generated insects/mummies/great Aunt Edna, NOT scary in the least. Enter a concerned boyfriend, and two other Night Terror alumni, add some subway cars (hello Mimic again), a pool, an elevator, some hiney shots, more cheesy CGI effects, and this film equals a complete waste of time.

1531136,4,B00005JLHF,"So much better than its reputation that it's scary, ""They"" is a cryptic, cerebral horror movie that's like the Rorscach Test of film: what one person sees in it may be vastly different than the way another views it, and that could be the main reason behind the wildly mixed reaction it's received.

  The nameless, shapeless things that scare you in your room during childhood, glimpsed in shadow or heard in silence, or suddenly perceived while half-asleep, are real.  Or are they?  At least one young man thinks they are, thinks they're still watching, and thinks he's discovered ways to track their patterns.  After getting in contact with childhood friend (and ""They""'s main protagonist) Julia Lund, Julia finds herself drawn into the 'delusions' of her friend, who shows all the signs of deep mental illness and severe paranoia.  But could he still be right?  A number of others experiencing the same apparant phenomenon enter the picture, and it becomes uncomfortably clear to Julia that ""They"" may be more than paranoid imaginations.

  With great performances all around, including Laura Regan (Julia), Jon Abrahams, and perhaps most of all Dagmara Dominczyk, and alternately gloomy/eerie and gorgeous/eerie cinematography (see the nighttime road scene shrouded in fog and surrounded by dense trees) this is a seriously underrated horror movie.  Some have said its weakness is it only seems to be showing the tip of the iceberg of what its capable of.  I disagree with the 'weakness' part, I agree that for the vast majority of the movie it's only showing the tip of the iceberg.  There's something big under the surface here, something on par, perhaps, with the likes of what H.P. Lovecraft would imagine.  I'm not saying I would expect Chthulu or Yog-Sottoth to show up in a potential sequel, but that something on a really mysterious and grand scale Similar to what Lovecraft would write is (or could be) at play here.  The ending is shocking. (And a hundred times preferable to the Alternate Ending, which not coincidentally was the last Alternate Ending on a movie I really loved that I ever watched.  I'm kind of thinking now, 'if it's great the first time around I might be better off skipping the alternate, lest it dilute the movie in my mind'.  This alternate ending kind of weakened ""They"" in my mind but only for a few weeks, after which it returned to its lofty status in my heart.  Some people apparantly liked the alternate ending Better though, so you'll have to make up your own mind on whether you personally want to check it out)  The ending also leaves room for a sequel, but they would probably need to go Really big budget if they want to really explore the entirety of that iceberg.  Maybe a novelized sequel by a skilled author instead if they can't afford to do the follow-up right?  Sequel or none, this movie is a great one, a good 8.5 or 9 out of ten.  Also recommended (in more or less the same vein): ""In The Mouth Of Madness"", ""Boogeyman"" (2005; haven't yet seen the unrelated 80s movie of the same name), this year's stunning ""Dark Water"" remake (haven't seen the original yet), the ""Ring"" series (originals and remakes), ""The Shining"" (I prefer the '97 version, others prefer the '80 version), ""The Sixth Sense"" and science fiction's ""The Arrival"".",1123632000,37,3289,4.823529411764706

But these are monsters, not ghosts. They're under the bed, they hide in the closet. You get the picture.

""They"" is a very entertaining horror-piece, though perhaps far from being a masterpiece. I jumped in my seat several times, and recommend this movie to horror fans.",1122940800,,590,4.959595959595959
1531138,1,B00005JLHF,"If you were actually living the experiences in this film, and I mean really living them - if they were actually happening to you, then you would be terrified out of your mind. What could possibly be more frightening than something trying to ""get"" you, and you have no idea who they are, what they are, or how to fight them? Seriously, that's awful stuff.

However, it doesn't work in a film. In a film, you need identifiable heroes and villains. The viewers need to have an understanding of what the evil is. For example, the scariest films of all time have identifiable villains. Two films come to mind: The Exorcist, and Silence of the Lambs. Actually knowing what we're up against made them more frightening.

In THEY, we have no idea what the people in the movie are up against, so how could we possibly be frightened? We know that they are, but what good does that do us? We some spidery creatures that look like a cross between Gollum and an Alien, but who knows what their motives are?

This makes for a very bland, boring, and snooze-worthy film. The only scene that was worth anything was the very end. It's a shame that they didn't build on that a little more.

The main downside of THEY is that it feels small.  A sparse cast with few locations or extras.  Not much happens until the end, which packs a powerful punch.  But for that brief and ominous ending, I'd give this film two stars.

Many scenes are derivative, though I suppose that's hard to avoid after a while.  The country road where the woman's car breaks down reminded me of THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES.  The freight elevator reminded me of THE RING.  The wake after the guy died reminded me of THE SIXTH SENSE.  The swimming pool scene reminded me of CAT PEOPLE and GOTHICA (the latter was released after THEY, but ironically had a better swimming pool scene).  The mirror-like extra-dimensional passage reminded me of PRINCE OF DARKNESS.

Adding to THEY's smallness are the Canadian locations.  The story is set in Manhattan, but you only see a few barren streets that don't look anything like New York, partly because they're trying to hide the fact that THEY is shot in Canada.

If you're going to shoot in Canada, set the story in Canada, like David Cronenberg did in the 1970s.  That way, you can take advantage of Canadian locales, and not have to ""dummy down"" the film by hiding locales.  Films shot ""on the sly"" in Canada invariably come off poorer for it (e.g., FEARDOT.COM and ISLAND OF THE DEAD -- the latter tried to hide the fact that Toronto looks nothing like Wall Street by filming Taliso Soto from an extreme low angle, so we only saw the tops of skyscrapers and no streets).

Not that THEY even manages to hide its Canadian locales effectively.  The subway station plainly says ""Victory Square"" and the trains say UTA whereas in NY it's MTA (for Metropolitan Transportation Authority).  As one familiar with New York, these bloopers take me out of the film.

I said this was a TV movie.  Maybe not, but it looks like a made-for-cable movie, so I'm guessing that's what it was.

And it's short.  About an hour and 23 minutes (not including end credits).

And you don't get a clear view of the demons, even at the end.  What you do see looks kinda slimy.  They're okay monsters, but nothing special.  I wish we'd seen more of their dimension, but it's cheaper to only show a bit.",1111104000,2,2438,4.648711943793911

And forget about 'Wes Craven' part.  What does this 'presents' mean anyway in 'Wes Craven presents'?

Horror fans must remember the name of the director of 'They': Robert Harmon.  He was behind the camera in Rutger Hauer thriller 'The Hitcher' in 1986.  For 'They' FOCUS FEATURES (the indie company of '21 grams') assembled the following cast -- Laura Regan, Marc Blucas, Ethan Embry, Dagmara Dominczyk.  And 'They' are coming to them (except one).

Legan is Julia, graduate student of psychology, with a boyfriend.  On a rainy day (like that of 'Se7en') she receives a call from her old friend Billy, who almost demented warns her: beware the darkness, for they are coming.

The film goes on at the plodding pace at first, though Rene Ohashi's brooding photography is one great merit.  The scares are not all effective, all too predictable, and the story itself is not an original one (see for example 'Darkness Falls' and Anna Paquin's 'Darkness'), and the ideas are mostly borrowed ones.

But when 'They' are really coming to her and others (and this hardly visible 'They' designed by Patrick Tatopoulos), the film gradually becomes better, with quite thrilling (if slightly illogical) sequences (in a swimming pool and a subway tunnel) that builds up to the striking ending.  Though the weak opening is never to be recovered, the last chapter is a minor triumph.

The problems are twofold: one is that, as I said, the film  takes too much time to reach the very well-made set-pieces.  And the other is that the acting is mostly below average.  You might hate me for saying this, but Laura Legan is not ready for the leading lady's role yet.

Don't expect the fast-paced thriller, or the steady flow of scary scenes with which you might associate the name of Craven, the master of horrors.  It is more atomospheric, and perhaps with a better luck, after. like 10 years, 'They' might be recognized as cult horror.  Just perhaps.",1106784000,2,2107,4.8

In the end, what you have is a film that attempts to play more with your mind than with your eyes.  You don't get to see the creatures very well, and when you do, it's too dark to make anything out.  The story is stale, the acting is stale, and the ending is a bigger letdown than the rest of the film.  In short, I don't recommend this flick to anyone unless they are a hardcore Wes Craven fan.  This movie feels unfinished and I don't plan on watching it again.  I recommend movies such as ""Signs"" and ""Darkness Falls"" if you want a few mindbending thrills.  If ""They"" have a sequel(perhaps it will be called ""Ya'll"" and take place in the South), the gaping plot holes can be filled and the story can find some sort of conclusion, but until that day, stay away from this snoozer.",1101686400,12,1245,4.3004291845493565
1531226,3,B00005JLHF,"'Nightmare on Elm Street'--masterwork;'Last House on the Left'--okay; 'Shocker'--weak; 'Scream'--perfect, but 'They'--nice try. We know Craven has taken over the modern dark-horror film world, is know for his gratigious gore and sex, and maintaining a fairly well-made picture throughout all. With the exception of 'The People Under the Stairs,' ""They"" is among the most trite of his pictures to date.

Shifting the blame to poor performance on part of virtually the entire cast (besides perhaps Domincyzk) only worsens the flops this picture suffers. Lunds portrayl of the hapless, night-terror victim brought me to nausea before the first half-hour, and dozens will agree that once the creatures drag her into thier world forever, you'll be applauding the credits. Suprisingly, Blucas proved a weak actor as well. Could it be bad scripting? Who knows, but more importantly, who cares?!

If Craven's near-plajarism of 'IT,' in scenes such as Lund's getting spurted in the face by sink drain-scum, don't make you weary of deja-vu', you might as well turn off the VCR. Most of the entire plot was a recreation of various nightmare-themed films, many of which Craven himself crafted (Yes, I know it's pathetic). Lighting and sets were appropriately dreary, the music reminescent of ""Scream""'s, and the CG used for the night-terrors is neatly composited, but even long-time fans of Craven's macabre mastery may be sadly disappointed. No offense, guys, but this one belonged on the cutting-room floor from reel one.

1531229,3,B00005JLHF,"Wes Craven Presents: They (Rick Bota and Robert Harmon, 2002)

Robert Harmon's name appears at the end of They. Rick Bota's does not. I get the feeling Bota originally directed and Harmon was called in to save the resulting mess. If so, he did a surprisingly good job of it.

When this movie came out, it was universally trashed. Not surprising. Any movie whose name begins (director) Presents... is usually going to be horrific. (There are exceptions, however; Robert Zemeckis presented us with The Frighteners in 1996. Keep that in mind.) Wes Craven has an especially bad record, having ""presented"" us such gems as Mind Ripper, a film even the combined talents of Giovanni Ribisi AND Lance Henriksen couldn't save. Lurking under the surface of They, however, is actually a really good movie. And it comes out at times.

Explaining why this is would be a vague, but major, spoiler, so get ready for it. If you plan on seeing the film and haven't yet, stop reading now.

I am willing to give points, automatically, to any film that doesn't automatically embrace the Hollywood ending. So when I got to the final moments of They, and it ended exactly where I hoped it would, I was mightily impressed. (Note: I understand the UK release had an alternate, Hollywood-esque, ending. Sorry, you lot.) Yes, it does have an exceptional sense of deja vu attached to it (if you see the end of this movie and don't think of a certain John Carpenter film, you probably need to go back and watch said Carpenter film again; saying which one it is would be giving away too much), but Harmon handles it better than Carpenter did. And that, my friends, is one hell of a trick, when you think about it. Remember, this was a film Carpenter directed at the height of his powers.

The movie centers on Julia (Laura Regan, who had a two-minute part in Unbreakable, and recently played the title role in Saving Jessica Lynch), a grad psychology student whose best childhood friend, Billy (Boston Public's Jon Abrahams), has just committed suicide. Billy, like Julia, suffered from extreme night terrors as a child. At his funeral, Julia meets two of Billy's other close friends from long ago, Sam (Ethan Embry, looking almost unrecognizable) and Terry (Keeping the Faith temptress Dagmara Dominczyk). They, too, had night terrors as children. (One wonders how a kid kept two different sets of childhood friends.) Billy's night terrors had returned just before his death, and he was convinced the things in his dreams were coming back to get him. Thus, his death. All well and good (and providing some excellent black humor, wonderfully timed; a rarity in films like this), except now the others are starting to get the same idea...

There's a lot here, and some of it is unexplored. Normally, that drives me to distraction, but this time I found myself hoping they'd make a sequel focusing on Sarah (Kingdom Hospital's Jodelle Ferland), a young girl Julia meets while trying to uncover the mystery of the night terrors. Sarah is a patient in a hospital who also suffers from night terrors, and knows who They are. This led to all kinds of questions in my head. There's a hospital dedicated to studying night terrors? The staff have collected all these stories about They? Could the staff, too, know about They? (If so, the final scene takes on an added dimension of ominousness that many viewers might have missed; think about it.) Put together a sequel about Sarah, once she's Julia's age, but with more street-smarts than Julia (who is, to play devil's advocate, slightly smarter than your average monster lunch, but probably not up to the brain level of your typical psychology grad student-- at least, judging by her actions here), and you could have one serious barnburner on your hands. Get someone with real teeth to write the screenplay-- Alex Garland or William Goldman, maybe-- and put it in the hands of a top-notch director. Richard Donner hasn't done a horror movie in a while.

Meanwhile, back at the ranch, They is not nearly as bad a movie as the critics made it out to be. Worth a rental. ***",1093305600,2,4085,4.761299435028248

1531232,3,B00005JLHF,"You can tell that ""Wes Craven Presents They"" is a horror film because it looks like a horror film (dark and creepy) and it sounds like a horror film (unrelenting ominous music).  The fact that the title is ""Wes Craven Presents They"" is another clue that it is supposed to be a horror film, but the problem is that for most of this thriller it is working so hard to be a horror film that it ultimately fails.
The ""they"" in ""They"" are basically the things that go bump in the night, although in the film's prologue, set nineteen years earlier, one small child finds out that they do more than that.  The title of ""They"" reminds me of the black & white sci fi classic ""Them,"" the difference being that in the latter we got to see the giant ants in all their giant puppet glory and in this film we are not really sure what ""They"" are.  We know that they come in the dark and maybe there is something to do with a doorway opening between our world and their world or dimension or cubbyhole or whatever.
The heroine in distress is Julia Lund (Laura Regan), who is finishing up her master's degree in psychology.  As a child she was plagued by ""night terrors,"" and those come rushing back again after a friend kills himself, insisting that that horrible creatures of the night have been coming after him in the dark and that they will be coming for Julia next.  Suddenly defending her thesis is not the worst thing she has to face in the week to come.  Of course, the obvious irony is that as creepy things start happening to her everyone starts to think that Julia should be declared a crazy person and should not be in any position to treat them.
Brendan Hood is credited as the screenwriter for ""They,"" but my understanding is that he came up with the basic idea and original draft and then about a dozen writers and producers came in and turned it into this mess.  I was totally surprised at the end of this movie.  Not ""surprised"" in the sense that the ending was unexpected, but ""surprised"" in the sense that suddenly the movie was over and as the credits started to roll I stopped munching my popcorn and said, ""That's it?""  However, this ending is better than the alternative ending, even though it makes less sense (you will understand when you see the alternative ending).
Lund, who played Jessica Lynch in last year's made for TV film, does a good enough job given what the script gives her to work with in this 2002 film.  However, the actress is done a disservice by a totally unnecessary nude shot.  When you make a point of avoiding showing body parts in several bedroom scenes and then suddenly do it for no reason whatsoever, it offends me.  Making a horror film that is not scary offends me too, but not as much.
It was nice to see Marc Blucas as Julia's boyfriend, showing that the abilities to deal with a strange girl friend that he showed on television's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" are still going strong.  Seeing him also reminded me of another film by a ""BtVS"" alumni, ""Darkness Falls,"" with Emma Caulfield, which also has something that only goes bump in the night.  You might consider them as a late night double bill, because between them you might find enough scenes for a decent horror film.",1082678400,,3213,4.45144804088586

And what's worse, it might be coming back to get her.  This isn't a new idea or story and that's why I was fairly disappointed with this film.

One of the big things about this movie were the characters, since 'They' are only after four of them. But the makers of this film did not develop any of the characters very well, so I didn't care if any of them died or not. Especially the guy that committed suicide.
They also did not explain anything! Like, what was that bone/splinter doing in her head? How did it get there? Why was it there? And why were 'They' coming after those 4? It felt like the makers were too lazy to answer any of these questions, resulting in a short, shallow movie with plot holes and confusion.
This movie made me mad instead of scared, although I tried my best to enjoy it, which was enjoyable at a few points. They were just few and far between. This really could have been a great movie. They had a very good idea with the monsters and everything, but they never fell through with it.
They could have utilized the baby-crying, and the lights turning off better, but they didn't. They could have developed the characters better, but they didn't. Laura Regan could have eaten something, but she didn't. They could have done a lot of things, but they didn't.

1531345,4,B00005JLHF,"Okay, I must say this. I can see why people didn't exactly, or didn't like this movie. Most horror movies are ruined by the endings, and this was one of them. Even with the alternate ending, the whole movie would have led to sadness. There was really no way out for Julia from the beginning because THEY had her trapped from the start.
Julia (Laura Regan) is a Psychologist in training at college. As a Psychologist, she would come up with a logical explanation for things that are happening. But there is no way to get out of the reality that her world will fall apart around her. When her lifelong friend Billy tries to warn Julia that THEY, the monsters in their closet which may not be so imaginative, are coming back for them, she knows he must be teetering on the brink of insanity. Billy shows her a strange scar that he believes came from THEY so he can be identified, she still thinks there has to be an explanation. When he takes his own life right in front of her, she finally realizes his overactive mind may not have not been so fake after all. When several people she meets end up with a strange and mysterious mark, just like the one Billy had, out of nowhere, she knows he may have been right. When the same mark appears on her forehead, and something comes out of it, she knows she doesn't have much time to live. As she tries to escape the horrorfick vortex that THEY have caught her in, THEY finally come after her in a way she cannot escape.
The acting in the movie was okay. I have to say the only good acting in the whole thing was done by Laura Regan. She was great. The plot was good, but if only they could've made it a better ending. Like someone said before, the alternate ending would have given it the Wes Craven idea. Somewhat like Alfred Hitchcock, or John Carpenter. But why was it called Wes Craven presnts They? He didn't even write the story. That was probably ...for publicity just to get attention. I thought the movie would be somewhat perdictable, but it wasn't nearly as perdictable as I thought, considering THEY would jump out at any time, all of the sudden.

Childhood friends reuniting in their adulthood and having one thing in common, being traumatized as a child by a spook. Don't go in the dark because there are monsters there, and the monsters can't come into the light. This idea was just used in DARKNESS FALLS.

The film centers around Julia, a psychology grad student, who receives a phone call from an old friend of hers. While at a diner, her friend Billy explains that ""they"" are coming to get him and that he's so scared. Unable to understand what he's talking about, Julia tries desperately to make sense of the situation. Unfortunately, ""they"" scare Billy too much and he decides to kill himself to get away from them. Thus starts Julia's quest to figure out what in the world caused her best childhood friend to take his life.
Having had night terrors as a child as well, Julia meets up with Billy's two friends (who also had night terrors) and discover that ""they"" get you when you're a child, mark you, and when your mark reappears, ""they"" come and get you.
Overall the movie isn't very scary, but it has it's suspenseful moments. I was a little disappointed since this is a Wes Craven-produced film. The story is one that has been used many, many times in other horror films, with even less explanation about who or what ""they"" are. All we know is that ""they"" are these long-legged spider-like creatures afraid of light who attack you somewhat like the alien in the Alien films.

1531352,4,B00005JLHF,"Childhood fantasies and fears of things that hide in the closet have purveyed in films for years and years.  (MONSTERS INC. does a great job in ""satirizing"" those fears).  Wes Craven ""presents"" this film, and although Harmon did a bang-up job in 1986's ""The Hitcher"", his aproach in this one is more subtle.  It is a moody, often terrifying look at the possibility that there were monsters under the bed and in the closet.  And as some other reviewers have mentioned, those ""things"" never really did have a specific form or content; they just popped out of wherever and hopefully you were lucky enough to wake up and find out you were just dreaming.
Harmon's film is generally well done, with some creepy creatures that jump out and scare you quite effectively. Laura Regan as the heroine, Julia, and Marc Blucas as her studly Paul, don't come up to Streep or Cruise, but they are generally effective.  Regan's waifishness and naivete make her fragile character more sympathetic.
The DVD has an alternate ending that would have been effective, too, although the movie's ""official"" ending is a little more imaginative, if a little bit depressing.
THEY is one of those movies that could stay with a child, or one of those adults who still don't like being in the dark.  Let me go turn on my nightlights!!!",1065139200,,1303,4.743362831858407
1531353,5,B00005JLHF,"When you were a child and darkness and the rattling of thunder besieged your world, how did it make you feel? Were you one of those people that could sit in it and find yourself fearless, knowing beyond knowing that there was nothing hiding within the shadows and that Mommy and Daddy God would dispel all forms of hardship? Or were you one of the people that knew something was awry and could perhaps hear something slipping through that silent void, scratching at the boards under your bed, slightly afraid and hopeful that you parent's were right when they said that there was nothing out there? Or perhaps you were one of the even more unlucky ones, hearing the nails of those spectral hands clawing through your closet while you sat huddling underneath the covers, knowing that ""they"" come for you at night?
And what if that fear wasn't simply something of a childhood trauma playing out, but was something more sinister and far more real? What if those sounds had figures and they came back for you now?
Within ""They,"" the ideas themselves are not original and the process of eliminating the characters is nothing that audiences haven't seen. All fans of the genre have heard these thoughts recycled over and over again, and all of those reprocessed affairs never seem to lead to new revelations on what being afraid truly amounts to.
But the fear that is produced therein is effective nonetheless, not really needing to be something unique to allow one to shiver and fear the dark.
By using a cascade of effects that let the shadows breathe just out of sight, you can see images that aren't quite images as they skulk into the ""real world"" in search of something that eludes their ""reality bound,"" docile prey. As the movie progresses, those shadows show more and more of what they are, too, and the beasts therein seem like something out the nightmarish Silent Hill 2 while culminating on other plateaus.
As the onlooker, you find yourself sitting at a table with characters who peer into the shadows that you wouldn't want to look into, and you know that something is lurking there and that it is looking back.
Honestly, it is a frightening affair in some places.
Added to that are people that seem like people, with lives that try to mingle in the world of absolutes but that find themselves disassociated as the themes progress. From the initial blows landed, with the shock causing little reality waves to the worlds awash in nightmares, you find yourself watching faces that find themselves thrust into a world where they are, in so many ways, lost and looked at as crazy.
This leads to some moments that are a little odd and disconnected, but that are nonetheless interesting to watch because the disintegration of lives as monstrosities terrorize them is oftentimes beyond the mundane.
The one complaint I would voice is that some people jump into the pool of thought from far left field, leaving you to feel like you've missed something at first. Things do come around and are explained, mind you, but that initial confusion is something that I've never liked breeding in my mind.
Still, if you like your shadows with claws, the darkness with an agenda, and your endings unhappy, then the flaws are easily overlooked. Little kids being taken and marked, disappearing into the night, isn't something you get from a genre that has become infested with ""let the little boy go"" mentalities too often in this PC world of demise. Here, in those nightmarish alleyways, is something akin to horrific redemption from that fatal movie flaw and it is nice to behold.

Problem with the movie is everything leading up TO the ending.  The lead actress is the most boring I've ever endured.  Good horror films need STRONG female leads!  She's simply there.

I guess I have to say most horror movies have a comical sense that Gahan Wilson fans would enjoy and understand.
They...is a good movie I have to say.  One that I actually took the time on several mental levels (extremely rare with movies of this day and age) to study it.  I see a lot of people fussing because there is never an answer as to what and who ""they"" are.  Well isn't that the point?  Wes Craven's movie is almost Lovecraftian simply because you can't really ""name"" the monsters.  These monsters are not Jason or Freddy or even the goofy ones in Scream.  Instead, these are fears, transformed into an almost physical body, that not only is out to get you, but darn well feast upon your wholeness.  They have no specific body, though you sometimes see hints and allegations of them, they really have no face or personality...except the personality to eat you up.
Such fears go back not just to your younger days, but to those times when you were a young boy or girl, needing badly the nightlight of Mickey Mouse or Bugs Bunny so that you can sleep peacefully.  Yet when that light bulb burns out.  You know and I know that ""they"", or so in the mind of a child, come out.  Of course they really never got us...but I would hypothesize that these creatures were our first realization that there was a darker more sinister aspect of reality, not really hell, but an underworld where there were monsters and gnashing of teeth.

Basic premise that probably a number of people have already written:  four people suffered from night terrors as children, have been marked with some type of sliver-wound that bleeds when ""They"" are targeted and are disappearing one-by-one while (surprise!) no one believes them.  To be honest, that's it.  Nothing else is explained in this movie at all.  No one knows what ""They"" are, where they're from or why they tag these people and take them to Neverland in hell.
The pace on this is so slow I found myself bored.  I didn't even jump when I was supposed to because the jump scenes were way too predictable.  I stayed with the movie hoping that the ending would make up for it (as some movies do) but unfortunately the ending was up there with ""The Ninth Gate"" with Johnny Depp.  Even worst, Ninth Gate was BETTER than this rotting turkey.
It's confusing, boring, incredibly predictable (my family and I would blurt out who would get picked off at each scene) and a terrible ending that was a complete let-down.

1531544,2,B00005JLHF,"I admit I was pulled in by the ""Wes Craven Presents"" moniker, so I expected at least a fairly scary movie.  What I got was a story with mild frights, tension, and a terrible ending.  The bad thing is there is an alternate ending on the disc that was much better than the original and would have greatly improved the overall movie (more on this later).  The general plot involves ""night terrors""; those things in the closet that scare us as a kid.  As this story goes, ""They"" really exist and come back for us when we grow up.  A young psychology student (Laura Regan) witnesses the suicide of her friend who has become so frightened that ""They"" will find him, that he takes his own life.  She later learns that her and two friends were taken as kids and marked so ""They"" can find them as adults, and take them back to their world.  In fact, we witness the abduction of the suicide victim in the opening scene of the film.  Early on, the movie relies on mood and what we don't see to scare us.  Later, we are shown the CGI generated creatures.
As I mentioned, the disc contains an alternate ending to the film.  Had this ending been used, many of the stories inconsistencies would have been cleared up.  I suspect the writers/director filmed the movie with one thing in mind, but shot the ending that ended up on the film due to the reaction of a test audience.  That's a shame because with the alternate ending, the film would have had more of a ""Wes Craven"" feel.  Some films are ruined by the ending and this is particularly true for a B-Grade horror flick.
The widescreen picture is sharp and clear.  The Dolby 5.1 is not overly utilized, but handles the creature noises well.  Other than the alternate ending, there are no other extras on the disc.  Not that this movie warrants a lot of extras, but the price of the disc is fairly high for such a bare bones offering.  I would have like to hear the director's reason for changing the ending.  If you are a die hard fan of modern horror, there are many other titles that I would recommend before this one.  Others will want to avoid it all together.",1058313600,10,2103,4.373711340206185
1531545,1,B00005JLHF,"The first sign that I wasn't going to like this movie: it reminded me too much of that OTHER incredibly bad ""horror"" movie that came out last year, ""Darkness Falls"". Actually, for all I know, they may actually be the same exact movie, only with a different cast. Heck, they both even star former Buffy the Vampire Slayer cast members! However, that is not enough to save either movie. In ""Darkness Falls"" the evil baddie was the tooth fairy who stayed away from the light because she was all disfigured, and if anyone opened her eyes and saw her, she'd kill them. In ""They"", the evil baddie is, well, ""they"" (don't ask me what ""they"" are, please. I really don't know. And more importantly, I don't care). ""They"", like the ""tooth fairy"", like to stay out of the light. But get them alone in the dark and ""they"" can't wait to pounce on our little Mia Farrow lookalike named Julia (played by Never-Seen-Her-Before Laura Regan). You see, these little ""they"" things marked her and a few other people as children. Seems ""they"" implanted them with what looks like a splinter. Why, you ask? Because ""they"" could. That's why.
Seriously though, I can't tell you too much about this film, the main reason being that it just didn't hold my attention for very long. Yes, I did finish it, and I will admit the ending was not 100% bad. However, it does not make up for the rest of the movie. The acting wasn't that good, however it was not the worst I've ever seen (for that, check out ""The Shaft"", possibly the worst excuse for a movie EVER). The plot? Well, there was one, I'm sure. I just didn't pick up on it. Probably just me. Other people may love this. But if you're looking for a good scary movie, please look elswhere. You don't even have to look that far: Wes Craven's ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series is pretty creepy. I guess he should have stayed in the realm of dreams.

Don't get me wrong, I like those movies, but enough is enough.
Without spoiling it, I'd just like to say, it's not nearly as bad as others have said and it deserves at least a rental viewing by any sci-fi or horror fan. With that said, I can understand why some wouldn't like this movie. It isn't as mainstream as most movies are and it isn't as supernatural/freaky as Wes Craven movies usually are. Again, in my opinion, by NOT being typical Wes Craven supernatural-horror is what saves this film. I suppose most would dissagree with me on that matter.

1531641,2,B00005JLHF,"I would give this movie only one star, but I think that the direction and the special effects are enough to merit two. The movie does create a somewhat decent atmosphere, and it is a bit creepy, but there are severe faults in the course of the movie that prevented me (And possibly others) from enjoying it fully.
The first problem, I would say, involves the ending. The alternate ending available on the DVD is actually very good, and would have made the movie much better (Maybe even raising it to a two-and-a-half or even three-star rating). However, the ""real"" ending is quite disappointing. It builds up the movie to a conclusion that is never concluded. It's the sort of ending that you'd get when somebody thinks they're being clever or fooling around with your brain, but really, they're just being lazy and not finishing off the movie.
The second, and much more devastating problem is that Laura Regan does a terrible job and her character is a poor choice for a heroine. It's bad enough that Regan can't act to save her life (Figuratively or literally, however you look at it). It's made only worse by her stupid, stupid character.
You know those horror movie cliches that annoy you? Like when a character is all alone in a creepy house wearing nothing but their underwear and then they decide, ""Hmm, the attic would be a good place to hide?"" This movie is full of those stupid cliches / decisions, and almost all of them come from the heroine. She is unlikeable, unbelievable, and very difficult to sympathize with, which makes the movie difficult to enjoy.
On the plus side, the creatures are nicely rendered and pretty creepy. Also, I'm pleased to see that the movie relies less on cheap scares and gore and more on subtle suspense and eeriness (Even though it kind of weakens down as it goes on).
This is a movie that could have been incredibly scary if the script was retooled a bit and if the main character was replaced by somebody we could like.
Though, I have to say... Regan is disgustingly skinny... and her frame is by far the scariest thing I have seen in years. Yech!
VIOLENT CONTENT - Most violence is off-screen. There is no gore. There are some dark images and ""They"" grab people and drag them around on the ground, which is a bit disturbing... but it's mostly not that bad.
LANGUAGE CONTENT - Almost none. Nothing worse than what you'd hear on a sitcom on network TV.
NUDITY / SEXUAL CONTENT - I seem to remember at least one needless shower scene, but there isn't any nudity. There are a couple of scenes where some characters are just about to become intimate, and nothing is shown.",1056758400,4,2612,4.583333333333333
1531642,3,B00005JLHF,"Though THEY is ""presented"" by Wes Craven, his name doesn't appear anywhere on the credits of this B-horror directed by Robert Harmon, best known for the cult classic THE HITCHER.
As a child Billy (Josh Abrahams) suffered from night terrors. Now 19 years later the nightmares have resurfaced, but this time he awakens with a Freddy Krueger-esque slash mark on his hand that won't heal. He calls his friend Julia (Laura Reagan) and when she meets Billy at a local diner she finds him dishevelled and visibly disturbed. The explaination is simple: Billy tells Julia that he is haunted by dark dwelling creatures that can affect electricity (And of course, has a thirst for human blood). But conveniently there are mysterious power fluctuations in the diner which electrocute Billy before he can give Julia the full story. Is this a plot device to help build suspense; or is it just plain old-fashioned indolence on the Screenwriter's part? Watch and decide for yourself.
What's more macabre is that prior to Billy's death, strange events that could only be of supernatural origin have been occuring in Julia's house: Such as random short circuits, blood gurgling out of the bathroom sink and an icky black substance smeared on her bathroom mirror. Could this be a coincidence? Nope. At the funeral Julia learns that several more of Billy's friends have recently been having ""night terrors"" that they had as kids. No prizes for guessing what happens next.
THEY is a passable time killer which is better than a lot of similarly themed direct to video horrors, but this could easily be dismissed as a low-key, toned down variation on NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. Horror fans may still want to check it out, but THEY will mostly appeal to novice horror fans in their early teens rather than hardened genre buffs.

The movie begins with the usual scared kid in his room, being comforted by his mother after screaming out at night.  After being calmed, the mother leaves her son to the light-a-phobic shadow dwellers and they come for him (cut to main character).
THE BAD STUFF:  The Heroine of this movie is a Sara-plain-and-tall who is finishing her thesis for her masters in psychology.  She of course suffered from `Night Terrors' as a child and has since come to terms with her past, now she is a thriving young woman with a future.  Suddenly all turns up side down, a friend from the past contacts her and informs her that ""THEY"" are back ... !scary!!  She immediately meets the crazy friend just in time to chit-chat with him before he blows his brains out.  Normally this would be a very emotional and riveting scene, but it was more annoying than anything else.  The script at this juncture was extremely childish and pre-packaged so that any chances and enjoyment were long gone.
Now that the plot has been establish, you would expect the movie to explode with stunning situations of terror ... sorry this movie does not come with any.  Two friends of the dead guy join up with our main character (who all live in weakly lit lofts or apartments, go figure) to pool their resources in an attempt to free themselves of ""THEY"".  Normally in a movie you would expect some inventive explanation of what is going on, but the characters have no clue, and as such, nor will you.  The only explanation given is that the monsters come for you initially as a child; they mark you; then retrieve you at a latter date.  Once the mark returns, you're screwed!  Weak all around movie!
THE GOOD STUFF:  On the DVD there is an alternate ending which actually had an inclining of old school Wes Craven.  The main character is in an unfamiliar room that has a locked door with a window.  She looks through the window and notices that she is in a mental ward, and all of the characters in the story are all either patients (like her) or doctors.

If you were one of those unimaginitive children who were not frightened of the dark, or if you have forgotten those fears, you will hate this movie--it won't scare you and you will think it is bad.
The acting is pretty much stock-in-trade for a horror film, meaning that it has the usual share of ups and downs.
The story gives no concrete details of what ""they"" are.  This is one of the key points in ""how well do you remember your night fears?""  If you remember (if you were imaginitive enough), part of what made the dark so scary is that the fears were amorphous--all you ""knew"" as a kid was that there were things in the dark that were out to get you.  You could imagine so many possible forms they could take, so many possible details about them, none of which were certain.  Therefore, you did not know what they were, why they were after you, or how they would get you, and you had only the vaguest idea of what they looked like.  You knew they kept to the shadows so that they could not be seen clearly, and you knew that when lights were shined at them, they simply were no longer there, only to reappear in another shadow or when the light was moved away.
This movie plays on those exact fears, and actually gives more details than you had as a child, details which make the creatures all the more strange and frightening.  If lights make them go away, as imagined in childhood, what happens if they can make the lights go out?
I say again, if you are close to your night fears from childhood, if you remember them well and if they were highly imaginitive, this movie is for you.  If not, avoid it like the plague, because you will hate it.",1054944000,25,1886,4.245810055865922

This movie is about night creatures that lurk and haunt peoples dreams and then come after them in their real lives. Do these creatures exist or are the people the creatures ""haunt"" just insane and seeing things? That's the trick up this movie's sleeve and by the end of it, you won't really care. The premise is good, the acting just okay (the best performance from Buffy's Marc Blucas who is great in everything) and the intentions are good like I mentioned before. But that doesn't save this movie, or any movie for that matter. Too many plot holes and too many boring, paranoid characters add up to a whole lot of nothing.

7940818,5,B00005JLHF,"""They"" is a movie that I think is highly underrated. In a time when so many horror movies, particularly psychological thrillers, teased the audience by letting you guess what is real and what is not, ""They"" goes away from that tiring plot element (unless you watch the alternative ending; don't watch the alternative ending). The main protagonist, Julia, is a grad student in psychology. She also had a terrifying past as a child, where she was plagued by night terrors. This did not come back up until she met with with her childhood friend, Billy, who is now experiencing the terrors again, only this time invading his everyday life. He believes that ""they"" marked him as a child only to come back for him as an adult. After Billy killed himself in front of her, Julia is now having the exact same experience, except no one in her life believes her. A sense of horror, isolation, desperation, and abandonment pervades the whole movie. I enjoyed it from beginning to end, which I cannot say about a lot movies. It is highly recommended if you like psychological thrillers.",1439078400,,1073,4.74331550802139

7940821,3,B00005JLHF,"This is a ""sci fi"" film light on special effects. Jake (Nick Holt) and his sister Sarah (Debbi Pick) live in a remote northern cabin 205 miles north of Manitoba. They have a few scientist guests when the earth is invaded by aliens we never see, but they attack us with red lights and red and blue smoke bombs.

People get ill and die as our group stay in the cabin listening to the short wave radio, trying to figure out what is going on in the world.  Yup, that is pretty much it.

The transfer to DVD wasn't the quality I hoped for on my Mill Creek edition. The dialogue concentrated on bad humorous stories, which actually made the film...yes aliens from Uranus. The sound track seemed to be added at random and didn't necessarily reflect what was on the screen. Was that a harpsichord?  Really?

The acting was sad also. Lovers of bad films can find moments of enjoyment. The original title of this film was ""Invasion from Inner Earth.""

Kid safe.",1414108800,,951,4.436781609195402
