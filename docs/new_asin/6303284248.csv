7842890,5,6303284248,"This is a very effective workout. I have done a lot of the steel videos,and have enjoyed a lot from the series. I have never done thighs of steel 1,but I have done this one. I think it is awasome,all you have to do is grag a chair for balance and to do the sitting exercises. Lisa leads you through very hard but effective legs segments the are cool and controlled.

  I sure was sweating after this video. Lile I do after almost all of my videos. This video targets the buns,hips,legs and especially the thighs. You will definately see results with this tape as well. Leisa Hart is very clear and cues well.",1152576000,,608,4.315789473684211
7842891,5,6303284248,"This is a very effective workout for your thighs.  However, keep in mind that this is actually a strength-training workout that uses your own body weight as resistance and uses a lot of exercises that isolate certain muscles.  The only time cardio is actually used is in the beginning as a warm-up.

I've been doing weight training and cardio routinely since the beginning of the year.  I've been giving my legs extra attention within the past few weeks and have really noticed results by incorporating this workout with the other stuff I do.

Also form is very important with any exercise you do, so make sure you are using proper form with this workout.  ABDOMINALS IN!!!  Also, make sure you have a slight bend in the supporting leg (knee) during the standing exercises--never fully extend the knee!!!  Otherwise, you won't have good balance and you risk injuring yourself.

GOOD LUCK!",1130889600,2,888,4.866666666666666
