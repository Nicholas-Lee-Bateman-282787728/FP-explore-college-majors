8468353,5,B005EIJN4W,If your a supporter of CTE or the trades this a great video show anyone that is not supportive.  It really shows that students need the hands on experience and work experience in the JR High and High School classes.  CTE classes are the application of all the core classes.,1387756800,,273,4.44

8468355,5,B005EIJN4W,"This documentary sings the praises of tradesmen, an underrated and unappreciated set of professionals who deserve far more respect.

Full disclosure: I am a carpenter by trade.  This film gave a real boost to my ego.",1373328000,,216,4.972222222222222

8468357,5,B005EIJN4W,"I showed TRADESMEN: MAKING AN ART OF WORK  DVD to my two History of Science & Technology classes this fall 2012 at the Community College where I teach in NYC. I wanted to show them an appreciative look at the Trades. The film portrays the dark and bright side of blue collar workers--plumbers, electricians, carpenters--who love and hate their jobs. Most like their work and take pride in what they build with their tools and hands. Some green companies help  rehabilitate abandoned houses in inner city areas. I got teared-up thinking of the good they do for depressed communities and the families that live there. All and all with serious commentaries from UCLA Professor Mike Rose students got clear information regarding the need for workers in the Trades. The film helps dispel the stereotype that manual labor is for the cognitively dull and is lowly and boring. I half expected the large combined lecture hall class to rush for the exits as happens in those silly NYS Lottery ads where after the announcer tells the audience of the big jackpot prize they all speedily run for the doors! Well perhaps that was asking too much and too quickly but given the large ranks of unemployed it makes sense for us in the teaching profession to introduce students to more and better options. The Trades workers, if unionized or own their own small business can make much more money than four year college graduates. We need to expose our country's need for good jobs in manufacturing and in the Trades. This film does an excellent job in helping to move us in that direction.",1349222400,,1570,4.747252747252747
