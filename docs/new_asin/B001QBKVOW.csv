8335322,5,B001QBKVOW,"A parody of the Japanese pop idol industry, mixed with loads of innuendo and Victor/Victoria-style sexual confusion. Only the Japanese could (and would) mix a characteristic fascination with the cuteness and naivete of teenaged girls with some really perverse undercurrents. The result is spectacularly funny, and really harmlessly innocent, so long as you check any moral hang-ups at the door. The English subtitles are more coherent than what usually shows up on a Japanese DVD, so you won't miss a thing.",1236729600,8,507,5.271604938271605
