2438862,3,B000BRFELM,"I think the reviewer is referring to the 2006 ""The Good Shepherd"" which starred Robert De Niro and Matt Damon. This one stars Christian Slater.",1170806400,2,143,4.76
2438863,3,B000BRFELM,"The super secret world of the Central Intelligence Agency could easily be summarized as life in a pressure cooker of ambiguity.  The people inhabiting its shadowy world must be highly unique, able to endure a life walled off from events that to most people constitute typical life.  Those around them need be aware that these individuals will not be able to come home and summarize events from their workday while relaxing and sipping a beer.

""The Good Shepherd"" presents Matt Damon as this type of special person, someone who rises high in the darkened, secretive portals of the Central Intelligence Agency.  The superior who taps him for yeoman top-level duty after the war, when the CIA develops into a regular governmental agency after being started as the wartime Office of Strategic Services, is played by Robert De Niro, who is also the film's director.

De Niro's character will be perceived by informed history buffs as the man who headed the OSS, William ""Wild Bill"" Donovan.  Damon's character is a composite of two actual CIA agents who attained prominence after their clandestine periods of duty ended.

A point made in the development of the story that will be quickly recognized by followers of the 2004 presidential race is how Damon was initially tapped for intelligence service as a member of the increasingly infamous Skull and Bones secretive organization while an undergraduate at Yale University.

Skull and Bones was prominently mentioned during the 2004 general election in that both George W. Bush and his Democratic Party challenger John Kerry were Skull and Bones members.  When the media asked the presidential candidates about the organization, each replied that it was so secret that they could not talk about it.

When Damon marries it is to someone with high pedigree, in fact, a daughter of a Skull and Bones member.  Angelina Jolie looks ravishing as the woman who marries the enigmatic, non-expressive Damon.  She is the daughter of a prominent United States Senator.

Michael Gambon performs brilliantly as a professor of Damon's who teaches a poetry course.  Gambon makes a homosexual advance to Damon that falls incomplete, after which he is satisfied to help develop what he feels are poetic skills in his student along with introducing him to the intelligence world.

The coldly brutal side of intelligence work is manifested in Gambon's ultimate fate.  His case study illustrates the impersonality of a system in which human beings lose their humanity in a game in which they are used in the manner of pawns, the discarding of which is done with calculated indifference.

Jolie becomes depressed in becoming a solitary figure that is not accepted into Damon's secret world and so she begins to drink heavily.  After the death of her father she leaves him for a time, going to live with her widowed mother in Arizona.

The only person in Damon's life seemingly capable of generating any emotion within him is his son, played by Eddie Redmayne.  The son becomes a dramatic focus of the film after he becomes romantically involved with a beautiful young African woman.

The relationship puts Damon's son unwittingly in harm's way and into the midst of a clandestine spy struggle between East and West surrounding the planning and execution of the Bay of Pigs Operation in Cuba at the beginning of John F. Kennedy's presidency.",1170547200,4,3365,5.005385996409336
2438864,3,B000BRFELM,"Some films are like spaghetti with red sauce at your favorite joint. They don't pretend to be haute cuisine, but with any luck they're filling and don't repeat on you. The Confessor fills the bill. It's tightly written, well acted and shot with no waste or indulgence. Though this film's plot and themes are provocative, it handles them without sensation and exploitation. Instead, we're given quiet thoughtful scenes peopled with believable characters.

The Confessor is kept blissfully brief, permitting only the scenes necessary to illuminate Slater's character and the mystery that's forcing him to question his self concept. This film is as much a character study as a thriller and Slater is very credible as the cleric-capitalist ""hero"". Fleshing out the script's sparse strokes with admirable restraint, he manages to keep us positively interested in a character that we'd otherwise disdain or disengage from.

The direction and cinematography are competent but unembellished, offering only a few poetic / artistic shots. The two that spring to mind are: the wine pouring shot with Slater and Rea, and Slater's end of day offload of his personal items. (He places his Rolex watch and Day Planner next to his Bible on the lectern in his somewhat lavish domicile.)

Unlike many films of its genre, The Confessor offers neither writhing scenes of moral agony nor bombastic out-of-character heroics. Thematically, the film permits viewers to select the polemic in which they wish to engage: the role of the church in a secular world, the role of the cleric within the church, or simply, the inevitable waning of youthful passion and what to do about it. Still, some may find this film boring, so if you're scared off by the phrase character study, then stay away from this film.",1148774400,9,1781,5.071672354948806
2438865,3,B000BRFELM,"Christian Slater pulls off his character well.  He doesn't push the ""Jesus"" envelope at all.

Stephen Rea - Gives a grand performance,  just occult enough to cause an eyebrow raise.

Gordon Pinsent - Weak,  but villainous enough to be entertaining.

Nancy Beatty - A great bitch!  She's mean,  but one can ""feel"" an underbelly of self cruelty as well.

The writing is intelligent and doesn't push the religious faction of the film at all.  God and organized religion are subtexts to the main plot of the film.  This type of film usually leaves the watcher with a feeling of being ""Bible Thumped"" for two hours.  This film doesn't.  It meanders through the reality of the church and it's true reality of humanism.  The characters are well written and acted without the usual over dramatic scenes.  This film is convoluted but it entertains.  It's a drama yes,  but more so an low paced action film within the genre of suspense.  A great ending as well leaves you nicely entertained.

This film is entertaining.  It's not overtly memorable,  but it's fun and thought provoking.  You'll enjoy it,  once.",1143331200,15,1100,4.795698924731183

8091473,3,B000BRFELM,"I did try to be optimistic while watching this movie, but it was hard to find big redeeming qualities in it (unfortunate pun not intended).

The plot begins well enough and feels like it's building to a good old fashioned conspiracy theory, but let me clarify that it is NOT one. The ending makes this a rather conventional mystery genre piece. There isn't really even a big action scene anywhere. It's almost as if the crew originally planned to make a really gripping movie but then chickened out for some reason. Neither the plot nor the characters are remarkable. At times, the characters aren't even likeable, and I don't mean because they'll remind you of people you know or because there is a delicious puppetmaster or villain. There isn't enough development in the time the movie takes up (90 minutes really isn't sufficient time in many cases for thriller/suspense stuff, despite it being a common movie length these days).

Don't get me wrong: I can't abide really brutal mysteries, and I also appreciate more cerebral ones. This film squeaks by without a lot of on-screen blood or excessively twisted motives, and there is something admirable about that in its own way. Here is a movie you could watch late at night and not have nightmares about, and that too is admirable. I just wonder if there could be a less deceptive way to package/market this flick to reflect these somewhat gentler qualities.

The cinematography is happily devoid of unnecessary handheld camera sequences (choosing instead to use tried-and-true techniques or very simple tricks), but that also means that there isn't as much suspense as there should be for a movie which bills itself as a thriller.

I won't dwell too long on the cast. Christian Slater's character is initially interesting - a priest who is downright shrewd and reasonably good with all manner of PR work - but never really proves to be very complicated or captivating. I can be patient if there is an interesting archetype to follow (the man who lost his faith, the bitter cynic, the fish out of water, a mental breakdown, a colorful/criminal past, etc.), but that change doesn't fully happen. I can't decide if this is the writing's fault or Slater's (I want to think it's the writing). The scripting is probably competent, but since a lot of the plot falls flat (and doesn't even TRY to be spooky or exciting), it's hard to notice this at times. The climax has a spark of compelling human behavior, but this appears too suddenly and stops too quickly, and it is somewhat canceled out in the final scene (which has a distinct tint of smug vindication). I failed to see any blistering intelligence in either the acting or the characters themselves, though I hesitate to actually say it was a mess. It seems like the cast could have looked better if the writing was just a bit stronger.",1411257600,,2839,4.775967413441955
8091474,3,B000BRFELM,"""The Confessor"" is a 2004 Canadian movie of middling quality, filmed with modest, if quite adequate, financing. The movie is alternatively entitled, confusingly, ""The Good Shepherd"", a monicker that it shares with a much better known motion picture, a quite different one, released within two years (in 2006) of its own date and which has a more uniformly illustrious cast (Damon, Jolie, de Niro, Baldwin). The big name in the cast of 2004's ""The Confessor"" (a.k.a. ""The Confessor"") is Christian Slater (portraying Fr. Daniel) and among the rest of the cast, Gordon Pinsent is perhaps the most celebrated name. The acting in ""The Confessor"" is really rather good; its main problem, to the extent that it has any, lie in the script itself and in that, for this viewer at least, ""The Confessor"" just is not a particularly interesting specimum of the cinematic art.

The really major fault involves the perpetrator of the murders in the film. As I e-mailed a friend who was wondering what I thought of the movie, I stated, concerning its plot (quoting myself loosely), that ""I am too confused, however, about who the killer is to figure the movie out and I really don't want to have to watch it over again to understand that. I just barely remember seeing the killer, McCaran (played by Stephen Rea), earlier in the film, but I forget who he is"", the murderer being such a minor character (so it deceptively had seemed earlier in the movie) that by the time that he takes the spotlight in the confrontation between himself and nosy Fr. Daniel (Slater), one has forgotten who McCaran is! My buddy had exactly the same problem! Well, the bonus feature does not help to make sense of that crucial fact, either, so most viewers, like myself and my pal, would have to watch the entire movie over again to know that; however, the film simply is too little worth seeing, at all, to bother doing so. If the potential purchaser wants to avoid this problem, which makes rather for a significant flaw in a mystery film, he would be advised to watch the end of the film, then return to the beginning. Doing that will help him to have his bearings in the climactic scene of the attempted murders of the priest and of his lady friend, even if the suspense of ""who dunnit?"" concerning all of the acts of murderous mayhem in this story has to be sacrificed in order to make sense of the plot!

The film, according to director Lewin Webb in his comments in the video bonus feature, attempted to give a fair and unbiased approach to portraying the current day Church. Indeed, the depiction of the Roman Catholic Church (R.C.C.) certainly seems realistic enough. The R.C.C. is in an awful slump and has been so for many decades, sunken as it is into terrible spiritual mediocrity, worldliness, and sloth, its force spent, its credibility (among traditionalists and mainstream alike) exhausted, to all of which the cynicism and ennui of Father Daniel Clemens' lady friend, Madeline Finney (played by Molly Parker), repeatedly gives voice. This pervasive futility and slackness come out clearly enough in the movie. In fact, given the most egregious prevailing clerical fault (i.e., rampant, vow-breakingly active homosexuality among the clergy) which continually grabs most attention in the news media (when they bother to mention the R.C.C. at all), it almost seems unrealistic that the film's murderer, a paedophile (or, more precisely, an ""ephebophile""), turns out to be a layman rather than some errant priest.

The R.C.C. has been badly on the skids, in North America and in most of the rest of ""the developed world"", since the wrong-minded misapplication of the decrees of the Second Vatican Council. Thus the movie's depiction of one parish's and one English-Canadian diocese's predicament is very typical (and thus also highly topical) of to what the Church has sunk in our time. In fact, apart from that tawdry sort of thing, why would most people even care enough about the R.C.C. to bother watching a movie, like this one, about its current, sadly declined state? The glory of Byzantium -- the faith, liturgy, and life of the Eastern Orthodox Church -- remains intact and vital, but the vaulting ambition of the Roman Catholic Church, its Western Christian rival, has crumbled to ashes, the R.C.C.'s spiritual treasures neglected and despised, along with its glorious Latin liturgy which vulgar, worldly, and clueless clerics have spurned.",1385510400,,4427,4.907877169559413

Nice plot and twist - not predictable, or at least I didn't see it coming

Good casting for Father Daniel

8091476,4,B000BRFELM,"This movie did not receive good reviews because it is somewhat simplistic and it criticizes the Roman Catholic Church; but it is a fairly good drama. We are introduced to Christian Slater who is a priest who is good in handling the business ends of the church, but not its religious mission. He enjoys the riches of the church, the costly car, gold watch, expensive wines and foods. He is called by a priest of a very poor parish who is accused of murder. The priest remembers Slater from school as a man who could amount to something. In contrast to Slater, this priest is very pious, more pious even than his bishop who wants to see his case handled as quickly as possible so as not to embarrass the church, even if the priest is found guilty. The priest could prove his innocence if he would reveal a confession that he heard, but insists, despite the admonitions of Slater and his bishop, not to violate the sanctity of the confessional. Two more murders follow, and Slater, despite his inadequacies, burdened by his conscious, decides to assume the parish priest's duties, after his presumed suicide. He realizes that a pious man like the priest who refused to reveal a confession would never violate church law against suicides. Slater also refuses to obey his bishop, gives up the above-mentioned accoutrements, and goes off to solve the three murders.",1294272000,,1359,4.738396624472574
8091477,2,B000BRFELM,"Christian Slater plays a worldly Catholic priest who is good at fund-raising. If you think Christian Slater is terribly miscast, there are more terrible things to come in ""The Confessor,"" of which story starts like ""Primal Fear,"" but ends like ""Alone in the Dark.""

Christian Slater is Daniel, a priest sent to meet another priest who is arrested for murder. The arrested priest pleads innocence, but would not tell the facts concerning the truths about what really happened. While the local media follows the case, with the ace reporter Madeline (Molly Parker) interviewing the suspect, another thing happens to Daniel, which makes him investigate the case on his own despite the friendly advice from Stephen Rae's character.

In spite of its slick pace, the film has little suspense throughout. The murder case itself is hardly intriguing or mysterious, with so many plot holes and incredible decisions of the characters. I heard more than one reviewer on the internet rightly complaining ""The Confessor"" goes like a made-for-TV crime thriller. But I think many, if not all, TV shows would spend more time on showing police procedures, at least the standard ones. Here the police can arrest a person without showing any physical evidences. There is an eyewitness, of which presence is totally forgotten until nearly the one-hour mark. To make things worse, the Church and its organization do not work as story's background to enhance the atmosphere.

The past romance between Slater's priest and Parker's reporter is implied. Actually, their suggested relation is the most mysterious and intriguing part of the film. The rest of the film is just an ordinary whodunit.",1190678400,3,1669,5.1512915129151295
