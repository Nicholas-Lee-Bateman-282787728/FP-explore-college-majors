6752827,5,B00OJ0X0Q8,"MONSTER MADNESS: THE GOTHIC REVIVAL OF HORROR opens w/ the coming of HAMMER studios, and their resurrection of classic monsters such as DRACULA, FRANKENSTEIN'S MONSTER, THE WOLFMAN, and THE MUMMY. In color! HAMMER also offered more bright red blood, and more female flesh. The Quatermass films and X THE UNKNOWN are also discussed. Beginning w/ CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN, the revival was on, introducing future icons, Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing! Includes great interviews w/ Lee, Cushing, Jimmy Sangster, Freddie Francis, Veronica Carlson, Ingrid Pitt, etc. Excellent trailers and clips from THE ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN, X THE UNKNOWN, and the gothic horror films. Lee and Cushing are given their proper due as legends on par w/ Karloff and Lugosi. Other stars, like Oliver Reed (CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF) are shown as well. HAMMER's psychological thrillers are examined. TIGON and AMICUS studios, and their horror anthology films, especially DR. TERROR'S HOUSE OF HORRORS and TALES FROM THE CRYPT are mentioned. The 1960's and 70's brought more violence, and even more flesh, including nudity. Ingrid Pitt makes her mark in THE VAMPIRE LOVERS! Censorship boards make their cuts. Movies like DR. JEKYL AND SISTER HYDE, HORROR OF FRANKENSTEIN, and THE SATANIC RITES OF DRACULA show the last days of HAMMER's incredible run. This third installment in the MONSTER MADNESS documentary series is as well-made, informative, and entertaining as the others. Highly recommended...",1445212800,3,1466,5.434210526315789
6752828,4,B00OJ0X0Q8,"Excellent doc if you're into Hammer Horror. Perfect blend of clips, talking heads, and best of all some fun and enlightening interviews with surviving cast members filmed from what must have been a convention and during panels. All the interviews are shot and recorded very. The only reason I can't give it a 5 star review is because of occasional loopy edits and some bouncing back and forth in chronology. Perfect flick for this time of year.",1443398400,,444,4.779220779220779

6752830,5,B00OJ0X0Q8,"Watching this helped to bring back some very pleasant memories of seeing many of these films upon their original release in theaters. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in  British horror films and those in particular produced by Hammer Films of England who pretty much produced the lion's share of many of these films throughout the late 1950's, '60's, and 70's....",1434499200,,382,5.063492063492063

6752854,4,B00OJ0X0Q8,"Very good documentary about the Hammer Film Studios. I appreciated the studios films back when i was a kid and a Dracula fan. I was a big admirer of Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee through the years. It was very interesting to learn about the history of Hammer Films. The only drawback for me was the quality of the video itself wasn't very good. In this age of High Definition video, It could have been better.",1454544000,,413,4.447368421052632

6752859,3,B00OJ0X0Q8,"Very informative about the next age of monsters from hammer. Originally these monsters were used at universal studios. Now in late 50s thru the 60 ending towards mid 70s hammer took the mantle of monsters and did there best. Stars like Christopher Lee , Peter Cushing and Micheal Gough bought a new horrific take on these monsters. ENJOY!",1448323200,,338,4.844827586206897

8683862,4,B00OJ0X0Q8,"If you're not a fan of Hammer Horror films then you should probably skip this documentary, because it focuses almost exclusively on that content. I personally found it quite interesting, though at times the audio was troublesome. A few of the stars and filmmakers being interviewed were hard to hear and understand... ESPECIALLY a series of clips being delivered by Christopher Lee. Lee was mumbling quite a bit, in an echo-filled auditorium... and when I turned on the subtitles to READ what he was saying, most of it was condensed with the word ""(inaudible)."" That was unfortunate, because I'm a fan of Lee's and would've liked to hear (or read) his dialog.",1502323200,,659,4.892857142857143

8683869,1,B00OJ0X0Q8,"This is a sloppily put-together hodge-podge of a film that is not even in high definition!  Many of the clips look like they were taken from  VHS sources, and some parts of this so-called documentary are fuzzier than that.  There are no subtitles, no chapters, some of the interviews are unintelligible, and in general, this is an insult to all horror fans.  Someone has to do a professional documentary on the subject.  I was going to purchase the rest of the series, but based on the poor presentation of this one, I'll pass.  Avoid this series at all costs!  To boot, the retail price is ridiculously high.  It might be a bargain at a dollar, but I wouldn't pay more than that.",1471910400,2,680,4.516393442622951
8683870,5,B00OJ0X0Q8,"This was a excellent retrospective.  It was my introduction to the backstory of Hammer films, so I felt like it put me on the map and showed me where to go next.  If you're already an expert, this might be too elementary for you, but I liked it.  Beware, though, the video quality isn't that great.  It appears that a lot of was edited together from grainy old video tapes.  The soundtrack is better than the picture.",1471824000,,417,4.363636363636363
