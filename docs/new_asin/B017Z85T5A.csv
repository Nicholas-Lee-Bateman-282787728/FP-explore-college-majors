This is one of the best underrated/not well known anime's you'll ever watch. From start to finish you'll be on the edge of your seat. This is personally one of my all time favorites. It's a more serious anime and has some very gruesome scenes. I've been waiting to find this for months on a safe site and am so happy it's finally on amazon. Definitely a nice and unique one to have in your collection.",1458259200,4,495,4.2105263157894735
