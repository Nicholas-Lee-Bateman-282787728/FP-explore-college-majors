8611353,3,B00F1BFQPC,This spends a significant amount of time sharing about the asteroid that struck Russia. Then goes into the hopes of capturing space rock and obtaining raw materials. goes on about how material from an asteroid could possibly power a space craft. (?) Occasional insight.,1489968000,,269,5.136363636363637
8611354,5,B00F1BFQPC,"This is really a followup to the Nova episode on the Chelyabinsk meteor, ""Meteor Strike"".  It begins by refreshing the memory on that incident and then goes on to discuss the need to discover all of the earth-crossing asteroids.  There is a new satellite being built for a 2018 launch that will use an infrared telescope that will make it much easier to see the usually dark-colored asteroids against the darkness of outer space.  This is the first step.

The next is either to destroy them or nudge them into a new orbit, the nudging being easier to do if you do it soon enough.  This depends on the ability of astronomers to be able to plot a very accurate orbit so they know just how and where to nudge them so that they'll miss earth.

Finally they discuss the possibility of capturing these asteroids, at least the smaller ones, putting them into a safe orbit, maybe around the moon, and then mining what is in them.  The biggest draw is not valuable metals -- which are undoubtedly rare inside them and hard to extract.  No, it's the possibility of things like water.  The reason for that is that rockets use water -- in the form of hydrogen and oxygen -- to power themselves.  Since that water would be up in space and away from earth's powerful gravity, it would be a good place to break down the water - using solar collectors would work -- and having any rocket in the area stop by for a refill.

That too is very promising, but the main aim of this program is to identify dangerous asteroids and then keep them from hitting earth.",1423526400,,1541,4.429078014184397
8611355,3,B00F1BFQPC,"This is a 60 minute video with scene selection and English subtitles. It explains what asteroids are and what the asteroid belt is. There is information in this video that uses pictures and clips from other shows that have been done.

The researchers and scientists explain that the results of the different effects of asteroids hitting the earth is because of the material it is made of and the angle it hits at. We learn the amazing fact that an asteroid has more potential to do damage than a nuclear bomb of the same energy, but it is never explained why.

There is some time spent on the possible mining of asteroids, but nothing is very detailed on this part of the topic.
This is a video that is interesting, but it does not seem as if they covered the content that they started out to do.",1409011200,,796,4.408163265306122
