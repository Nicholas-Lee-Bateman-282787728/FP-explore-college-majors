6396165,3,B00JWS9GRO,"Boy, this is an incredibly misleading cover for this  DVD of Emmylou Harris performances.

From the cover, you expect to see performances with a young, brown haired Emmylou Harris, from back in the mid 1970s through the mid 1980s. It is clear that some performances would have to be from the 1990s, since Prayer in Open D, for instance was not released until 1993..The back cover even states: ""rare songs from the 70s and 80s"".

But that is totally not true. All the performances from the mid 1990s. and perhaps later.

Just to be clear, I love Emmylou from whatever period of her long wonderful career. But if you are advertising performances from a young Emmylou Harris, you should be under some obligation to provide such performances. The same DVD company has issued a DVD of performances from Linda Ronstadt, that are advertised as from the 1970s, and they are exactly that. I know that Emmylou did tape some live performances in the 1970s and 80s, because I remember watching them at the time.

The sound quality is good overall.  But the picture quality varies from performance to performance, some of it being  decent, while other musical numbers are just so-so visually. I am happy to have anything live from Emmylou, but I do feel deceived.",1404950400,14,1250,4.7592592592592595

The cover photo is misleading since it shows Emmylou from the 70s while the video is from the 90s.",1452988800,,272,4.571428571428571

8654275,2,B00JWS9GRO,"""Broadcast archives"" Really! Performs songs of the 70s and 80s, forgot to tell you when. they were actually performed. I felt like I was watching a studio taping of Spyboy",1406332800,3,171,4.733333333333333
8654276,3,B00JWS9GRO,"It's difficult to rate this because while the audio is good, the video transfer looks like some shot this on a cellphone.

Also, as the other reviewer has noted, the description of this DVD is misleading (I would almost say fraudulent, but I don't want to be sued for libel.) In the first place, although it's called ""Two More Bottles of Wine,"" that song isn't even on the disc. Also, most of the footage is from a/some Spyboy concert(s) in the mid 90's that may have been broadcast on PBS (a station identifier for a PBS station in San Jose, KTEH, flashes at one point). And two of the numbers (""Easy from Now On"" and ""Gulf Coast Highway"") are from an Austin City Limits Songwriters broadcast also (I think) from the mid 90's.

All of that said, Emmylou Harris is my favorite singer, and she is in fine form vocally (as usual), and the Spyboy band is great. Three of the songs on the DVD are from Wrecking Ball. The problem is that this is basically a video of the ""Spyboy"" live album, but with some of the best performances from that album (e.g., ""Boulder to Birmingham"") missing.

So bottom line: If you have the Spyboy album, you don't really need this unless you want to see her in concert. And even then, given the poor video quality and the even poorer editing (""The Maker"", the last song, just breaks off before the end), you're better off with the albums.",1405468800,8,1364,4.448
