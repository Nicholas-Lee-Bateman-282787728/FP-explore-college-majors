2279716,5,B0009CTTQK,"IT'S OVER!!! *sobs* This was by far my favorite anime series. This dvd still delivers an awesome fight that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the end. Raizen is in it (yeah!) and you find out a little bit of what happens to everyone in the future. There's also a kiss scene in the final episode and an extended version of the opening theme song in English and in Japanese (Smile Bomb/Hohoemi no Bakudan).This was truly a great ending that left me in tears. Even Hiei ends up happy. And please look at the commentaries in the extras section. They are hilarious! trust me! Well, this will be my last yyh dvd review unless i get the box sets *sniff*. Again, 5 stars baby 5 stars! this dvd was truly spectacular and if you're a DBZ fan that would like a slightly faster moving plot, this is the series for you. Go check it out from beggining to end. It's a must see for any anime fan, especially action anime fans. Holla! YYH forever baby!

P.S. If you look in the background in the last episode when Kuwabara and Kurama are on the train and look closely at the billboard signs, yo9u should see a sign that says YuYuHAkushoEnd! right before the 1 hour photo sign.",1122508800,5,1170,4.318181818181818
2279717,4,B0009CTTQK,"Well, without spoiling things, I have to say that the ending was a good one, with only a few questions left unanswered (I would list the few, but I don't want to spoil anything).  However, as other reviews have stated, it was elegantly done.

I ended up giving it 4 stars because its the last DVD (and that in itself sucks) but just also, I wanted more action like the dark tournament, and these last DVD's really glossed over many of the battles and new characters. Still, a very good DVD.

In ""A Reason To Fight"" Yomi and Yusuke are pitted against each other in what is not even the semi finals. Yusuke is challenged to give meaning to the tournament. At the same time, several other fights are taking place, such as Natsume vs Mukuro.  I wish we could have had a few more episodes with those fights, but alas...Yusuke vs Yomi is a great fight though.  Don't miss it.

In ""Closure"" the battle with Yomi continues.  With an explosive end.  The winner of the tournament may surprise you, but the challenges all of the finalists have faced have certainly made all more introspective of their future and purpose in the tournament. Once again, I wish we could have seen more of the final matches, but alas...

In ""To The Future"", the series ends with a reunion and a ""where are they now"" kind of feel to it.  I would say there is closure to most of the storylines, although a few are left to the mystery of the future.

In the extras section of the DVD, there are a couple of cool commentaries from the voice actors and outtake foul ups.

If you are a true fan, you must get this final DVD. Undoubtedly, fans will mourn the ending of this great anime series.",1122336000,,1655,4.372549019607843
2279718,5,B0009CTTQK,"The final 3 episodes of yu yu hakusho are here, and they are amazing. Yusuke battles Yomi in the second round of the demon tournament, but he unfortunately loses because he realizes that he has no purpose to live his life in demon world, plus Yomi hears Shura cheering on him and knocks Yusuke out. When Yusuke wakes up, he thinks Kotto is still counting to ten. The last episodes reveals what happens to everyone and Yusuke's choice.",1121558400,2,434,4.576923076923077
2279719,5,B0009CTTQK,"It isn't a review, it's a plot outline, with spoilers.  It'll ruin the experience if you haven't seen it yet.

Now, if you really want to know how it is, it's awesome.  Yusuke finally realizes that everything he has done, has come down to this, one climactic moment.  He realizes his true motivations, and his true power, and the series finally ends.  Even if you're unsatisfied with the ending, you have to admit, it is exceptionally done.",1118880000,4,440,4.662337662337662
2279720,5,B0009CTTQK,"A Reason to Fight  :

As the fighters make their way through the main bracket of the Demon World Tournament, Yusuke Urameshi finds himself staring down Yomi. Both powerful warriors had their own reasons for entering, but one soon learns that he may not have any reason to continue. Which will be left standing when the dust settles?

Closure  :

Yusuke has been eliminated from the Demon World Tournament during his legendary battle with Yomi. In fact, as Yusuke awakens from the fight, all but one fighter has been eliminated! Demon World has its new King! Who emerged victorious? And what does it mean for the three worlds?

To the Future  :

High school student Kazuma Kuwabara is having a typical day. He is studying hard for his college entrance exams and fending off the flirtatious glances from his female admirers. But nothing could prepare him for what happens when he arrives at a mysterious meeting with Genkai. Surprise follows surprise as one by one each member of the old gang shows up! But where is Yusuke?",1117411200,6,1021,4.728813559322034

8059202,5,B0009CTTQK,"Any YYH fan who's been able to purchase the season boxsets already know that the special features are...well just not there. Trailers for other productions and textless songs are not the most engaging features. That's why I got this single disc. It contains the last....3-4 episodes of YYH and have several commentary tracks. Same quality as the boxset episodes (uncut and looked the same to me). I believe that this, if you're into the series as I am, is worth owning merely for the features. Commentary gold.",1391212800,,510,4.873563218390805
8059203,5,B0009CTTQK,"Yusuke Urameshi is a high school delinquent. He doesn't go to class, and he's always getting in fights. One day he is trying to save a boy that is about to be hit by a car, he is killed instead. He is approached by a pretty girl flying on a broom. Her name is Botan, and she's the Grimm Reaper. She offers him a chance to regain his life. After coming back to life Yusuke becomes a Spirit Detective. He gain spiritual powers and hunts down rogue apparitions that cause trouble for the living world. He is joined by his friend Kuwabara, the demons Hiei and Kurama. Together they fight off the deadly demons that seek to destroy the world.

After the tournament we are faced with the dramatic conclusion to an epic series that is now an anime legend. Yusuke returns home where Kayko has been waiting for him for all the years that he has been gone. The group of friends is reunited, and Yusuke  & Kayko can begin their long awaited romance. Everyone lives happily ever after.

This is a great series. It has lots of cool characters, good animation, voice acting, and a very engrossing story. It's a very long anime, so if you want to watch it be prepared to like it and spend a long time with it. It's one of those that gets more interesting as it progresses. Even though it has a bang up start it maintains the flow throughout. I would even go so far as to say that it's one of the most famous anime series' of all time. It has a bit of a Dragonball Z vibe to it, and everyone likes that. I highly recommend Yu Yu Hakusho to every anime fan, it's simply amazing.",1353110400,,1561,4.249158249158249
8059204,5,B0009CTTQK,I really enjoyed the entire series. I was glad and sad when I received the last disc. All and all the story was great and I'll watch in over and over for years to come.,1215388800,,168,3.8285714285714287
8059205,5,B0009CTTQK,"I recieved this DVD along with the Three Kings Box Set, but I'm writing a review for this specific disc for one important reason: it provides (drum roll, si vous plait) COMMENTARIES!

Yeah yeah, the episodes themselves are the best you'll ever see, but the commentaries bring the entire series into a new, oh-so-glorious light. There are six in total, one of which is an Outtake And Blooper reel, and that in itself is worth a million dollars. (The title to this review is based on one small line from the blooper reel, and there are plenty more where that came from). My second favorite commentary is done by the four main voice actors: Justin Cook (Yusuke), Chris Sabet (Kuwabara), John Burgmeier (Kurama), and Chuck Huber (Hiei). These guys are thoroughly hilarious, and I simply can not get enough of them. The other commentaries are amazing, too, and for the record I think Sean Teague(Koenma) is downright adorable.

Lastly I'd like to say that it is obvious that the people who put their work into this show (the writers, actors, sound mixers) love it just as much as the fans do, if not more so. Buying this DVD is like buying pure happiness in disc form. (Although, I suggest buying the whole box set; it is indeed incredible.)",1145145600,3,1236,4.665137614678899
8059206,5,B0009CTTQK,"The final episode has everybody aged a bit. They went from being Junior High school kids in the 8th grade too 10th graders. Yes two years has passed. The whole gang reunited except for Hiei. He is helping humans who mistakely steped into demon world back into human. They gang went to Genkai's place then they went to the beach. That's when finally Yusuke shows up. What make's me sick is when Keiko saw him she ran up and kissed him on the ground. After all the time's she slaped him. Who do she think she is. I don't care if she's a girl, I wished I would of finally got to see Yusuke got revenge and punched her in the face.",1143849600,,627,4.147540983606557
8059207,5,B0009CTTQK,"I think that the hole story's of Yusuke are great I just wish that it didn't end so soon.

I still hope that they do a new Movie soon on it that would be nice to see and they laft a lot of ?'s at the end and no ancers to them.

So I do hope they will do more soon.

8059208,5,B0009CTTQK,This is a good ending to a good seriers its a bit lovey dovey but good none the less.,1124409600,,85,3.526315789473684
8059209,5,B0009CTTQK,"Brilliant DVD! really a must have for everyone breathing.  I thoroughly relished every second of the end wishing it wouldn't. If you have an intrest in working in anime (who isn't?!) or just would like to hear what all goes into it (who wouldn't?), you must have this even just for the commentary.  Justin Cook went to great lengths to make this a true treat for the fans bringing them into every aspect of production at Funimation!!  You hear from the writers, the script supervisors, the re-mastering guy who made the music and sound so much more incredible (doesn't it just shake you to the core at times?), and the voice actors (yay!  Chuck Huber [Hiei] is a riot!!)  The whole crew sits down with you for the final episodes and walks you through all it takes to produce this amazing show.  The cast/crew is almost entirely anime veterans so you're getting it from the best, really.  And there is a special outtake commentary where you basically get ""the bloopers"" of the voice actors...Cynthia Cranz (Botan), Chris Sabat (Kuwabara), Justin Cook (Yusuke) and Sean Micheal Teague (Koenma) are so much fun when they mess up!  I really really enjoyed the commentary from John Burgmeier (Kurama), too.  Please Please Please do yourself a favor and check this out.  From Yu Yu Fans everywhere to aspiring ADR directors, you will not be satisfied without it, I promise.",1123027200,9,1367,4.778723404255319
