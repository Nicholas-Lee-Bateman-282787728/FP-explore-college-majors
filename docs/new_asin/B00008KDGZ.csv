1851085,5,B00008KDGZ,"Unlike all of the other romantic comedies, this movie posesses great laughs with a little romantic punch.  Although, it follows the path of all other romantic comedies in the sense that it is a little predictible, other than that, I found myself laughing through the whole thing.  Not to mention Kate Hudson's sexy co-star. I wish I could have someone as sexy as Matt. lol.  Anyways I really enjoyed the movie.",1044921600,,410,4.746478873239437
1851086,5,B00008KDGZ,"This movie was hilarious! I know critics refuse to believe this is a funny movie, but my boyfriend and I both LOVED it! It is a must see, and I know I am buying it as soon as it comes out on DVD. Watch it!!!",1044835200,,207,3.6222222222222222
1851087,4,B00008KDGZ,"All romantic comedies follow a formula.  This one is no different in that respect, however getting ""there"" is really a riot.  Watching this girl pull out all the stops to drive away a handsome, funny, intelligent man is almost too much to bear.  And watching him work desperately to not dump her makes the humor even more rich.
There were a few things I didn't like but those were mostly continuity type things and were mostly overlooked because I was laughing to hard to really allow them to register....  but then we do all know that movies aren't Really like Real Life!  For instance no one (especially a woman) can walk out of someone's apartment in New York City without a purse and expect to take a cab home!  At least I can't imagine that really happening.  Without those minor glitches I would have given this movie 5 stars.
The casting was wonderful.  The leads are definitely strong and likely (Matthew is certainly worth just looking at - he reminds me a great deal of Cary Grant, unconscious of his good looks and so likeable, and that slight Texas accent sure doesn't hurt), yet the supporting cast is just marvelous, too!
This movie is worth the bucks to see and later buy when it comes out on video.",1044835200,,1214,4.536697247706422
1851088,5,B00008KDGZ,I went to see this movie because I liked the people starring in it but I ended up laughing for two thirds of the movie.  It was very cute and Matthew and Kate have great chemistry which really made it fun to watch.  I would definately see this movie again.  My 13 yr old son said it was okay- at least he didn't say it was bad.  Have fun and IGNORE the critics- they are wrong!!!  GO SEE IT!,1044748800,,391,3.8987341772151898
1851089,4,B00008KDGZ,"Having read a Newspaper review that canned the movie, I went to ""...10 Days..."" on a intuition that while that plot may appear simplistic, trite and tried too many times, the
movie would still be worth seeing. Also, both the trailers and the actors were drawing cards for me.  I was not disappointed.
This was one of the more delightful comedies I have seen in the past few years.  The Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey's chemistry gives that plot a certain elan that with most other actors would be missing. The most amazing feature of the movie is its credibility. Haven't most people sometime in life set themselves up for a certain expectation in  some relationship only to find himself/herself
amuzingly and ingratiatingly surprised? We may propose but life disposes and that is what the actors communicate on several levels--professional, genderwise, emotional--that make""...10 Days..."" so enjoyable. Don't we all hope for life's surprises in love relationships at least in our untold fantasies? At those times we get to know ourselves a bit more deeply and have our desires fulfilled in the most uncanny ways.
Certainly this movie should not classified as an exclusive Chick Flick because I think most straight men would find a lot to relate to in Mike's character played by McConaughey.(After all, Kate is a knock-out in real life and Matt is an admirable stud in his own right.)
So if you want to laugh, feel a little bittersweet romance,and hope that life could bring some surprises to you too--go see
""HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN TEN DAYS"" and you may just find some of life's enchantment!",1044576000,,1595,4.878228782287823
1851090,4,B00008KDGZ,"Kate Hudson is great in the new romantic comedy ""How to Lose A Guy in 10 Days."" She plays Andie, a magazine columnist who gets assigned to write a story about the things women do sometimes that tend to drive men away. The main catch is...she only has ten days to scare the guy out of a relationship. On a search for a likeable guy whom she can use to drastically make the mistakes that will make him run towards the door, she meets Ben (Matthew McConaughey). Coincidentally, Ben has just made a bet that he can make any woman fall in love with him, in a short period of time. As fate has it, Ben and Andie meet...so let the games begin. While he's set on being the perfect guy he can be, she's set on driving him crazy with small but sometimes drastic annoyances that may do the trick. When they get personal, they find it's not work jeopardizing the true love that's hidden behind false intentions. And as the romantic comedy genre has it, one can only expect what will happen between the two, who claim to be doomed for a break-up...or not. The film is very funny and very likeable. Hudson has proved that she can be the new queen of romantic comedies, and this film will make her one. The two lead stars have great chemistry, and the overall feminine cover has a fun approach and should prove to be hilarious for anyone.",1042675200,,1323,4.338709677419355

He (Matthew McConaughey) is an advertising agent. To obtain an exclusive with the Diamond industry he has to prove he can make any woman fall in love with him within (you guessed it the same ten days)

I really liked it because it was not one of those romance movie that leaves women sad and depressed. It was really a good movie that you could laugh at and when they do fall in love it only makes the movie better. This is a movie that a couple could watch together and enjoy it and not get depressed. This was truly a classic love movie and both the main characters had good chemistry on the set.,1487894400,,512,4.13
1851133,5,B00008KDGZ,"Sleeping in. Clothes right out of the dryer. Seeing someone you miss. Dogs. Mac and cheese. These are, in my opinion, things the world offers that are universally loved. The film, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, should be considered no different.
This was the movie I would watch with my mother when my brother was having a sleepover elsewhere, it was the movie I would watch when I was home sick from school, it was the movie that gave me a cute pet name for my first boyfriend (sparky), and it was the movie I watched four times my first semester of college. I recently watched it on a lazy Saturday afternoon with some pals and pizza and after saying the lines in sync with the actors, I realized this movie is well deserving of credit. Even though it was not offered in theatres or with a super crazy awesome 3D effect, it is still a quirky and hilarious love story between two people who are definitely two hour eye candy.
  How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is a unique twist on your average romantic comedy. It focuses on Andi Anderson (played by Kate Hudson), a journalist for a womens magazine, and Benjamin Barry (played by Matthew Mcconaughy), a marketer, who are more interested in their current careers than in each other. The two date although their motives are questionable. Andis purpose is to write an article about- you know it- how to lose a guy in 10 days while Bens purpose is to make her fall in love with him as a bet to get ahead at work. This push and pull dynamic between the two creates a smorgasbord of entertaining and hilarious scenes which has an ending all rom-com lovers will enjoy. The movie takes a slight turn from comedy in order to develop the relationship between Andi and Ben but ends up making you root for the relationship more.
Kate Hudson and Matthew Mcconaughey are pure gold together. They have starred in multiple rom-coms together (and although Fools Gold was one of them, no pun was intended). Their off-screen chemistry as good friends makes the artificial playful scenes throughout the movie effortless. In one scene in particular, Ben and Andi go on a date to the movies in which Andi obnoxiously talks over the actors. When complained about, Andi tells the upset moviegoers that her boyfriend will gladly pummel their asses. Ben, trying to appease her, sticks up for Andi but ends up getting socked in the face by a man triple his size. This comedic scene transforms into an endearing display of affection when Andi rushes to his side. Hudson and Mcconaughey can do it all and their friendly feelings in Hollywood make them the most compatible and sought after pair any director would want in a romantic comedy.
This rom-com classic is perfect for a mother and daughter, a date with someone special, a movie night with friends, or a night to yourself and some take-out chinese. It will make you experience a range of emotions just like Hudson and Mcconaughey display throughout the film flawlessly. How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is universally loved and you owe it to your heart to watch it.",1487808000,,3036,4.548446069469835

This is one of the few really really good, really really funny rom coms. Kate and Matthew are terrific together. The storyline is clever and the supporting characters interesting in their own right -- I found Matthews' ambitious female coworkers and Kate's smug boss particularly interesting. Dialogue is laugh out loud funny-- really funny. As in, intelligent funny. Not just a bunch of words relating to poop and buttocks.
There's a bit of sexual material here and there so I wouldn't want my kids to see this movie without the fast forward button. Not as bad as most rom coms but still something to mention.
My one complaint is the main scene where the lovers fight in public wasn't really funny at all. Not to me, anyway. I found it just painful and undignified. The end of the movie is not as enjoyable as the beginning. Both of them are so hurt at one point it's hard to laugh anymore.

1851168,5,B00008KDGZ,"So its fluffy and predictable. It's unrealistic and sickly sweet. Who cares...this film pretends to be nothing more than what it is intended to be. Light romantic comedy.
Since stars like Cary Grant, Kathrine Hepburn and Irene Dunne, lit up our cinema screens in the 1930's with films like The Awful Truth, Bringing up Baby and My Favorite Wife, Hollywood and of course the movie going public have reserved a special place in their hearts for RomComs, screwballs and battle of the sexes comedies.
Identical plots, Identical jokes but none the less jokes and plots that will never go out of style and will always be relevant in any age or location, whether it be New York of the 30's or New York in the present day.
Hollywood has always worked on the basis that they stick to what has been tried and tested and has proved to work, that is why with a small plot change and a rehash of old jokes and situations they are able to reinvent their movies for a new generation of film buffs. It was through this formula that Doris Day and friends were able to continue RomCom history throughout the 60's and every one of them box office winners.
A recent example of this would be Down With Love starring Ewan McGregor and Rene Zelwegger. Who could not see plot comparisons to Pillow Talk or Lover Come Back? Yet it did not make this film any less enjoyable. Our entertainment lies in seeing our actors of the day fill the roles of the great actors of yesterday and how the scripts and jokes are adapted and told within a backdrop of 21st century life etc.
Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson made this film with impeccable comic timing and enjoyable performances. Of course with Goldie Hawn for a mother, Hudson comes straight from comic stock so I would have been disappointed if she failed to meet the challenge but she didn't. Some of her facial expressions and mannerisms almost had me convinced I was watching an old episode of ""Laugh In""
McConaughey also held his own and proved himself to be a gifted comic as he did in the Wedding Planner.
This plot seemed quite original and as a battle of the sexes comedy, they seldom come as good as this. Again the formula was followed and we were under no illusion on what the final outcome would be, but their journey to this ultimate destination is what we find entertaining.
This type of film has been popular for seventy plus years and their simularities are what makes them so. Instead of slamming them..watch some of the predecessors and appreciate their origins.
Be thankful they are still making these types of movies today as in an era which is threatening to be devoured by action thrillers, fantasy adventure and shoot 'em ups this seems to be the only diversity left in motion pictures.",1474243200,4,2736,4.597137014314929

1851319,3,B00008KDGZ,"I've got to admit, I enjoy certain romantic comedies.  They're predictable as can be, but if done well, they can be fun.  I'd always been curious about How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days.  Despite itself, I found myself drawn into the story.  Unfortunately, the story does help sink the film.

Andie Anderson (Kate Hudson) works for ""Composure"" magazine as their ""How to"" columnist.  Her real passion is meaty stories about politics and world problems, but since she has to appeal to the magazine's audience, she writes about relationship problems and shoes.  Her latest assignment is an article about all the things women do to drive their man away.  And she has to get first hand research for the piece, so she has to find a guy, hook him, and then turn into all the things that drive men away.

Meanwhile, Benjamin Barry (Matthew McConaughey) is fighting with some co-workers for the new diamond account his advertising firm has just landed.  He knows he can do an outstanding job, but they say since he never spends more than one night with a woman, he doesn't know them.  To prove he knows women, he agrees to a bet - he can bring any woman they chose to a company event in 10 days, and she will be completely in love with him.

The co-workers, knowing about Andie's assignment, set the two of them up.  And that first night, everything goes well.  But as Andie descends into psycho girlfriend mode, Benjamin begins to question whether he can last the whole 10 days.  Who will win the bet?  Will Andie and Benjamin ever speak to each other again when it is over?

My main problem with this movie involves the story.  For starters, why does Andie need to lose a guy first hand?  The entire article comes about because a friend and co-worker has lost yet another boyfriend.  Since she already seems to know what this friend is doing wrong, why does she need first hand research?

Since this is a romantic comedy, I'm sure I'm not spoiling anything to reveal that Benjamin and Andie fall for each other as the movie progresses.  But all I could think as I watched the film was why?  Oh, I get it on Andie's side since Benjamin is sweet and puts up with everything she throws at him.  But I truly don't get what he saw in her.  Yes, there are a couple scenes that are very sweet, but I still would have run away after those 10 days were up and never looked back.  The climax does little to wrap all this up, and in fact leaves a few other things dangling.

Having said that, I have to confess I found myself drawn into the story and rooting for Andie and Benjamin to fall in love.  So the movie did something right.  While seeing the flaws in it, I couldn't help but root for the characters to overcome them.

And the movie is funny.  While some scenes boarder on the embarrassment humor I don't care for, I still laughed at some of the things Andie did and Benjamin's reaction to it.  Frankly, that's one reason I did enjoy the movie.

Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey completely sell the movie.  Their performances also make it easy to root for a happy ending for their characters.  The rest of the cast is fine as well, but really, this is their movie.

The logical part of my brain was bothered by the serious flaws, but the emotional part was drawn into the story and enjoyed the movie.  As a result, I have to give a mixed rating to How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days.",1433116800,,3366,4.379644588045235

1851483,4,B00008KDGZ,"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is about Benjamin Barry (Matthew McConaughey) who makes a bets that he can make a woman fall in love with him in 10 days. Andie Anderson (Kate Hudson) is assigned to write an article on ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 days."" They meet in a bar shortly after the bet is made and from there starts the 10 days.  It's directed by Donald Petrie who before this directed movies such as Miss Congeniality and Grumpy Old Men.  Michele Alexander and Jeannie Long wrote the book How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days while Kristen Buckley, Brian Regan and Burr Steers are credited with writing the screenplay for the movie.

You have to thank my wife for the string of movies here that are either Romantic Comedies or Dramas because those are the movies that she enjoys the most.  Benjamin Barry is an advertising executive who must compete with two female co-workers to win pitching to a diamond merchant. He makes a bet with his competitors that if he can make any girl fall in love with him in 10 days that he gets to pitch to the company and they agree.  Then there is Andie Anderson who, to try and expand her writing career to write more meaningful stories, is writing a story on how to lose a guy in 10 days.  They both go to a nearby bar to find their so called ""victim"" and with each having their own bet to win, will either party be able to do it?

7d7e45a53ce7a51c6186bb075b3bdeab

The scene above is by far my favorite scene in the movie.  This is where Andie meets Ben's family and they play a game of B.S.  I enjoyed this scene so much because I loved the interaction of everyone and how they made her feel like part of the family.  I also enjoyed this because its one of the first times in the movie that you can tell that she is really falling for him.

I really enjoyed watching Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson work together on this film because at the beginning you could tell that they were just two people trying to win a bet.  Then as the movie went on you could tell that they were losing site of the bet as their feelings got in the way.  They worked well together which just made it that much more believable and I enjoyed that.

Overall I would give this movie a B+.  The chemistry of actors can really make or break a film and I feel like for this film it worked.  They really worked well together and when Kate Hudson was at her craziest Matthew McConaughey reactions were what I believe any guy would do in that situation.

1851595,5,B00008KDGZ,This is an adorable movie that had me laughing the entire time. The crazy things Kate Hudson does are exadgerated versions what a lot of females do in real life. Hope women are able to watch this and laugh at themselves for doing the same things in their relationships.,1394150400,,269,4.510204081632653
1851596,5,B00008KDGZ,Super funny! You find yourself rooting for both sides at different parts of the movie. Mild sexually suggestive content... I didn't see when I was younger.,1393632000,,155,5.0
1851597,4,B00008KDGZ,"Romantic comedies are always cheesy.  But they can be quite entertaining as well.  This one is no exception, it's cheesy, unbelievable, but still entertaining!

Andie Anderson writes a How-To column for a popular magazine.  Her newest assignment is to do everything women normally do to drive men away from relationships.  She's just got to find a mark to practice this on.  Which makes it hilarious when she encounters Benjamin Barry, an ad executive who won't get an assignment to sell diamonds unless he can prove to his boss he knows how to make a woman fall in love with him (there is a tie-in that explains this random requirement).  So the two unwittingly pair together to try to achieve both their goals which results in much hilarity.

Characters:

  Kate Hudson as Andie Anderson
  Matthew McConaughey as Benjamin Barry
  Kathryn Hahn as Michelle
  Annie Parisse as Jeannie
  Adam Goldberg as Tony
  Thomas Lennon as Thayer
  Michael Michele as Judy Spears
  Shalom Harlow as Judy Green
  Robert Klein as Phillip Warren
  Bebe Neuwirth as Lana Jang
  Marvin Hamlisch as Himself (Cameo)

I thought that all of the actors were well cast.  They were funny, smooth, and performed their lines nicely.  McConaughey and Hudson had good chemistry and actually made a very cute couple.  I could almost believe that they were real people.  I did think they both took it a little over the top at times, but seeing as this is a comedy of the romantic persuasion that's not really surprising.  It's probably a requirement.

The whole plot is hard to believe.  And relies heavily on coincidence, but the way the plot is carried out is cute.  You have these two people forced into something for the job, and yet they can't help but be attracted to each other despite knowing that it isn't going to last.  And the pranks that Andie played on Ben, well some of those were truly inspired.  It won't be the type of show for people who don't enjoy romantic comedies though.  Because it definitely fits the category.  There's no action, no serious conversation, no sword fights.  It's just romance and a little bit of karaoke.

Cute movie, but not for everyone.  But if you like funny, it's probably a good one to watch.

Two of my favorite actor and actress, Kate Hudson is very talented, and funny, everytime I see her, I think of her mom Goldie Hawn, they favor soooo much especially when Goldie was younger.  The fine and talented Matthew McConaughey who could ever not want to do a love scene with him.  He is such eye candy. I loved the movie because of those two, but I haven't been able to lose guys except for ex husbands, but that is why it's called a movie.",1387843200,,505,4.239583333333333

It's just a movie folks. But certainly worth a look. Kate Hudson is so beautiful and utterly adorable that I cannot imagine any man not liking this flick. As for Mr Take My Shirt Off in Every Movie, well, he just plays himself and is likeable enough in his own way. A little eye candy for the ladies. And the supporting cast is just wonderful. Some real talents in this ensemble cast.
No, this isn't Oscar material (most of those are utterly forgettable anyway since they are so focused on being ""serious cinema."") But this movie is very entertaining and funny. If you are not bitter or angry beyond all reason about a previous relationship, you probably will like it quite a bit.

Story is insipid.  One cliche after another.  This movie mashes every cliche together in one.  The characters are basically shallow jerks, so it is impossible to feel for them or care what happens.  And an otherwise decent cast can not save this trash.  It is the McDonald's fast food of romantic comedies.  And by the way, there is no comedy.  I detected zero jokes.  Filled with lame pop music that was obviously not just available cheap, but intentionally produced with an eye and an ear towards the lowest common denominator.

1851806,3,B00008KDGZ,"I watched this movie back when it was first released in 2003 and I recently just watched it again. It's one of those movies where you think to yourself, ""it was so much more entertaining the first time around..."" not to say it wasn't at all entertaining, it was! Just, you know...

Andie is a columnist for a female magazine (is it just me or do most chick-flicks have a character that lives in NY and writes for a magazine/works in fashion?) writing ""how to's"" and she wants more. She's got the qualifications and smarts to write things that matter but as in any job like that she has to write what her boss wants, not what she wants. So she takes up an assignment after her fellow co-worker gets dumped using her as an inspiration -- ""How to Lose A Guy in 10 Days"" -- by doing the annoying things girls do to drive guys away.

Ben works in marketing and while he's good at what he does, he too wants to break into a new brand of marketing. He's being cocky at a meeting and the girls who are trying to take the job from him challenge him to make a girl fall in love with him in ten days. I don't know what this has to do with selling diamonds, but uh sure okay.

They end up picking Andie. It's a set up from the beginning.

While this is suppose to be a ""rom-com"" (I guess) I didn't really catch the ""com"" part of it. I get that Andie was on a tight timeline to get Ben to break up with her within ten days but I think some of the things she did was a bit much and over the top. She was way beyond the ""annoying"" and straight into ""SHESAPSYCHORUNBENRUN"". When they were being normal people in a normal relationship however, they worked. Really well together and to see the predictable tragedy that awaits was awful! Just awful!

As much as I do enjoy this film, it's not one that I can watch over and over again (even as background noise) and as much as I love McConaughey (he's always playing the cocky player types, isn't he?), crazy Andie was just too annoying for me.",1352678400,,1974,4.184210526315789

This movie does not feel super dated, and Matthew and Kate are really shining stars and at some of their best in it.
Yes, it is still cringe worthy when Andie goes psycho, which is originally why I really didn't like this movie, but as an adult now I got more laughs out of it then I originally did. This is a fun movie to sit down and relax to. Definitely go ahead and pick this one up; you are probably going to want to watch it more then once.

The characters are well-drawn and the there's strong chemistry between the leads (strangely missing from the sequel, ""Fool's Gold."")  I can't agree that it's predictable in the first and second acts.  Even the third act is a surprise, but I'll grant you the conclusion is the weakest point of the film as it crosses the line (briefly) from sophisticated comedy into slapstick.

The Blu Ray transfer seems washed out compared to the saturated colors of the DVD.  But the picture is sharper.  The extras I think were included on the last DVD release of a few years ago.  I would have wished for a ""Director's Cut"" in this release, restoring the scenes that were removed to fit the 2-hour theatrical release timeframe but otherwise worth keeping in the film.  Maybe they'll consider this for the 10th Anniversary in 2013?",1251331200,3,868,4.746666666666667

Kate uses Matthew for her next big story, ""How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days"" and Matthew uses Kate to beat out two coworkers in a job by making a bet that he could make her fall in love with him.

1851910,5,B00008KDGZ,"The trouble with being a single guy at my age (32) is that typically, all your male friends are either married or living with someone. So if you want to go to the movies with your friends, you typically wind up watching what their wives want to see. This is how I was roped into seeing ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"".  This film has one thing going for it (and only one thing): Kate Hudson is hilarious playing the psycho girlfriend (and I've had a couple). Unfortunately, that might be enough for a 5-minute SNL skit or a guest appearance on a show like ""Friends"", but it's not enough to carry a 2-hour movie.  Everything else in the film comes from the sitcom ""Just Shoot Me"": Kate Hudson's character is a serious journalist ""trapped"" working at a shallow fashion magazine, and the characters played by Bebe Neuwirth & Robert Klein are carbon copies of Wendie Malick & George Segal respectively in the aforementioned TV show.  The ""plot""--so to speak--is that Hudson's character is going to pick a guy to clamp on to, then drive him away with all the stuff that women do when they feel more needy than desirable, after which she will write an article called ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"". Meanwhile an ad exec (Matthew McConaughey, who I met a couple of times when we were in college together) bets his co-workers he can get anyone to fall in love with him. They pick each other for their respective projects and the bad chick-flick comedy cliches ensue.  Another big problem I have with the movie is that it has nothing to do with the real world. Since when are the Knicks in the NBA finals each year? That hasn't happened since Jeff Van Gundy left. Also, as a Texan, I have come to accept that my accent is used for all sorts of rural types (Ohio in ""Heathers"", Alaska in ""Northern Exposure"", Minnesota in ""A Simple Plan""); and I realize that in the movies, everywhere outside of New York City proper is supposed to be the sticks. But surely even the most elitist Manhattanite must realize that people from Staten Island do *not* speak with an exaggerated Southern drawl.  For a single heterosexual male, watching this movie is like waiting for your sister to finish trying on outfits at a department store when you were a kid. You just wanted her to hurry up so you could go home and play video games. After watching this movie, I pulled ""Tetris"" out of the mothballs (OK it's on a hard drive, but you get the point) and found it immensely more entertaining than this film.",1223164800,,2479,4.4635761589403975

1851929,4,B00008KDGZ,"I think what makes me just love `How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days' is none other than Kate Hudson.  Her performance is just so hilariously charming it's almost impossible not to fall in love with her here.  I say almost because I've read a few reviews that suggest the other alternative.  To me though, while the film is clichd, it still manages to rise above the majority of romantic comedies today with a surprisingly warm performance by Hudson and an even more surprisingly charming performance by McConaughey.  I think it would be safe to say that Matthew general fails to really impress me.  I just don't see the hype behind his good looks.  Sure he's got a body but aside from that he's void of any real qualities that help him stand out and embrace the audience.  He's like Paul Walker to me.  Not really an ounce of acting ability but a charming smile and good hair.  Here though, and maybe it's just Hudson creating the perfect atmosphere, but he seems to be a little more in control of his scenes and comfortable in his skin.  I actually believed he was a living breathing person and not a manikin with a smile.

The film centers around two people needing to prove something.  First there's Andie Anderson, a beautiful journalist for a woman's fashion magazine who just wants her shot at writing the articles that intrigue her.  Basically she wants to break away from shoes and write about war.  In order to get her chance she has to write an article on the dating don'ts, the mistakes women make in relationships, namely, how to lose a guy in ten days.  In order to do this she has to find a man, make him love her and then drive him away chronicling the entire experience for her article.  Then we have Ben, an advertising exec who wants to break into the diamond market.  In order to win the opportunity to pitch a campaign to a wealthy diamond exporter he has to prove his undeniable charm by getting a woman to fall in love with him.  The woman that is chosen is Andie.  So Ben needs to attain Andie's love all the while Andie needs to drive Ben away and if either fails then they lose all that they are trying so hard to attain.

Of course we all know that in the end they fall in love, but getting there is a lot of fun.  As charming as Matthew is as Ben its Hudson's Andie that steals the show.  Even in her insanity she is irresistible.  Not only is she a knock out (so beautiful) but she knows how to accentuate her greatest asset, her personality.  Kate Hudson is larger than life here and she perfectly switches between charming aspiring journalist to charming crazed lunatic.  Her comedic timing is great here.  Whether she's going bananas over photo-shopped pictures of her family with Ben or swooning over her secret crush while he works a room full of diamond buyers, Hudson is on top of her game.  You can definitely see her mother in her eyes and that's a good thing, a very good thing.  Sadly Kate has moved on to duller comedies instead of embracing her talent with more suitable work.  Some have mentioned that this was the beginning of the end of her career, but I like to think of this as her last great effort.  Sure, it's no `Almost Famous', and dear god I hope one day she returns to those glory days, but it's still a great romantic comedy that fits it's leading lady about as well as that yellow dress (when you see the movie you'll know the one).",1189728000,,3381,4.389067524115756

Lighthearted and fun, McConaughey and Hudson make a beautiful couple with no small amount of onscreen chemistry. I hadn't seen McConaughey in a role I liked him so well in since Contact. He displays plenty of confidence and cocky charm, and flashes his trademark smile often enough to keep you interested. The only scene that really didn't work for me was near the end, at a swank dinner party, once both girl and boy discover one another's true motivations.

Unbeknownst to her, the man she gets is Matthew McConaughey, an ad exec who has been challenged by his boss and competitors at work to make a woman fall in love with him in 10 days or less. See? One wants to wreck it at all costs, one wants to save it at all costs. The wackiness is supposed to ensue.

Why It Doesn't Work: This type of set-up forces two very amiable stars to behave like nitwits for the entire film. By the time they inevitably discover that each was deceiving the other, you haven't developed any sympathy for either character. You don't care if they get past it and end up together. If just one was deceiving the other, you'd have a place to make your emotional connection to what's happening, and it doesn't even necessarily preclude you from ending up liking the deceiver (especially if he or she is being deceptive for reasons beyond their control). Here, however, they're both being extraordinarly callous about the feelings of another human being, for pretty flimsy reasons. After awhile, rather than sucking you in, it just starts to piss you off.

McConaughey's a very likeable star, and I'm crazy about Hudson. I'm inclined to like any movie she makes. This one, though, just makes ya try too hard. It's flatter than a pancake.",1126224000,8,1469,4.5606060606060606

The opening scene (after a bizarre montage of her former magazine stories) introduces her as a beautiful but deeply caring individual who wants to change the world through her journalism...by writing at a superficial women's magazine run by a terribly miscast Bebe Neuworth (I say ""miscast"" because she is too good for the shallow part).  This is the last time we see anything of substance from Andie, Hudson's character. Never once throughout the rest of the film does she show any depth or compassion. She acts incredibly silly every time she is in the same room as Ben, McConnaughy's character. It gets really annoying. She is not as bad when she is away from him, and the part of the movie where she visits his family is better than the earlier scenes.

There are some funny moments, including one in which Andie uses Photoshop to create a family photo album. I found that scene to be amusing. The scene that many people have mentioned, when she crashes Ben's bachelor party, starts out funny but is ruined by Hudson's horrible acting.

Also, I have not figured out yet how she was able to afford such a swanky apartment when a job of her sort would not pay that well. It's not like Friends, where the apartment is huge because it is a set. I do not remember seeing the inside of her apartment--just the outside, complete with a doorman.

And of course, the diamond family name is made up because we all know that the diamond trade in this country is a virtual monopoly run by the De Beers family.

Basically, this movie is a funny premise that was not well-written or well-acted. Part of the problem is that the movie is based on a very small, humorous book by the same name. The book is full of cartoon pictures and funny little tips about how to get a guy to leave you alone (i.e., cry during/after sex). It has no plot, so the screenwriters had to come up with their own plot while adhering to the lines in the book. This is a huge challenge that the writers obviously could not handle.

Hudson is pretty bad in the movie, and McConnaughy is not much better. There is a great scene in which he takes off his shirt--nice eye candy.

One thing that perplexes me is that this movie is often listed as a best seller and a best renter, especially with services like Netflix. I am not quite sure why so many people are still renting this movie when it has been around for several years now. It is not the worst movie in the world; it has some funny moments; overall, though, my thought was that I wanted to rewrite most of it. I kept thinking, ""I wish they would have....""",1119139200,3,3376,4.42512077294686

Though some scenes and plot are not consistent (e.g. Angie's expectations to write about politics & development while working for COmposure?..), you don't really care after you have laughed so much.  MAtthew is terribly sexy, and so is Kate (though she would have benefited from padded bra).

Her mission is to date some poor unsuspecting guy and do all the things a woman can do to put a man off her...baby talk, mood swings, fluffy toys round his apartment and so on. Matthew McConaughey is advertising executive Benjamin who also has a mission. He needs to make a woman fall in love with him in 10 days in order to win a lucrative contract. When the two meet the fun really starts as Andie desperately tries to get Ben to dump her and Ben, through gritted teeth, puts up with Andie's increasingly bizarre behaviour in order to win his contract.
Although there is nothing particularly new or original about this movie, it is still worth watching, thanks in the main part to its lead actors who manage to make the characters believable. There are some genuinely funny, laugh out loud moments...the scene where Andie turns up at Bens flat, while he is having a boys night, and starts wiping his nose in front of his friends springs to mind.

1852005,2,B00008KDGZ,"""How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days"" is a movie that has the classic bones of the type of bubbly romantic comedy we used to see far more of before 1970.  Doris Day and Rock Hudson plus good writers could have pulled it off spectacularly.  The premise is that Kate  Hudson's character is assigned a magazine article for a trendy magazine, the theme being the movie's title.  Matthew McConaughey is a serial bachelor determined to win a wager that he can engage in a serious relationship. Each becomes the other's prey, and what ensues is Hudson's writer pushed to more and more excessive behavior to shake the unshakable and unbelievably patient suitor.

Hudson, McConaughey and a talented supporting cast are ready and willing but their efforts are decimated by messy writing and an uneven, mean-spirited plot that never succeeds in suspending disbelief.  Rather than the witty 21st century battle of the sexes that this should have been, it feels more like ""Fatal Attraction"" with crocheted poodle toilet paper cozies.  Hudson's antics are agonizing and the scenes don't know when to end.  They lack a snappy rhythm.  Some lines were crossed that leave the civil world of romantic comedy behind.  Sticking the guy with the pet he never ordered without knowing whether he would take responsibility contemplates animal cruelty.  Dragging innocent family members into the mess does not seem particularly fair, and it is quite hard to appreciate the leads when they use someone else's special event for their own ugly climax.  Their original intentions are unprincipled, using supposedly innocent strangers for personal gain, but that scruple is easily resolved by the dual agendas, so that isn't a problem. Had they been played out with genuine humor and less extreme behavior, had the infliction of cruelty been confined just to the lead characters who finally reach the big revelation that they are basically good people and meant for each other (that's not giving away the plot because it is to be assumed), had it been a genuine lesson in how women and men think about romance, then it would be the film it should have been.",1110326400,,2120,4.924157303370786

Cute & sexy but I didn't catch the ""channeling Goldie Hawn"" thing. She's funny like her mom but in a different way. Ben, played by Matthew McConaugley, kind of cruises through his role like he always does. Someday he'll get a challenging role & we'll see if he can act. Kate too. Anyway, she is playing him & he is playing her. That they even meet on  a timetable is a bit improbable, but that they fall is love is of course predictable & never in doubt. I did wince at some of the stunts she pulled to repel him. Sex hovered over the relationship but never really landed. Good sex certainly wouldn't have repelled him in merely ten days. Bad sex wouldn't have made her fall in love with him in ten days, but the future posibility of good sex might. That's about it: your average, New York City romantic comedy.

In this case the magazine is called Composure and Andie writes the regular How To column. You know the sort of thing - How to dress to your body shape, How to lose 150kg in three weeks,  How to have the ultimate orgasm...and so on and so on. But Andie wishes to be taken as a credible journalist and dreams of the day when she can write articles on politics or How to Bring Peace to Tajikistan, but her editor will have nothing of it, so the How To column continues focusing on relationships, fashion, glamour, and salacious gossip. When colleague and friend Michelle (Kathryn Hahn) suffers yet another mystifying break-up with her new boyfriend of only a week, Andie gets an idea for a new column. It will be a dating guide in reverse - a guide to all the things NOT to do if you want to keep your man and will be called How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days. The catch is that she will experience this first hand. She will hook a guy at a bar, seduce him and once he's hooked, unleash every rotten girl-trick in the book to drive him away - all inside 10 days.

Meanwhile, advertising exec Benjamin Barry (Matthew McConaughey) is desperate to get appointed to lead the ad campaign for a new diamond promotion and will basically do anything to get the chance to make the pitch for the diamond campaign. Ever the ladies man, he makes the bold claim to colleagues that he could easily make a girl fall in love with him - inside 10 days, and they challenge him provided they can pick the target (I think you can see where this is heading). His boss agrees to the challenge and provided Ben can have a girl madly in love with him by the time of the big promotional party, the ad campaign is his.

What follows is a series of humorous scenes in which Andie and Ben hook up and she proceeds to drive him completely crazy by doing everything in her girl-power to make him dump her. Ben of course will suffer through anything and gleefully accepts all manner of horrible girl problems that Andie can throw at him. There is perfect chemistry between McConaughey and Hudson, and herein lies the strength of this film, because in a nutshell it adds precious little to the age-old ""lets make a bet about love and hope the other side doesn't find out, but they do"" routine. There are some genuinely funny moments - I can only imagine the pain of having a new girlfriend nickname your p**** 'Princess Sophia', or being forced to attend a chick-flick marathon at the local cinema, but it is the actions and the reactions of both McConaughey and Hudson to each other that many will find ultimately engaging.",1107129600,,2738,4.450199203187251

She will start dating a man and then drive him away, in 10 days, with things, that women usually do, that man don't like. Benjamin (Matthew McConaughey) works in advertising. One day he makes a bet with two of his co-workers. He will get the most important work, if he will bring a woman, which will be totally in love with him, to a party 10 days from that day. And his co-workers choose, which woman will that be. They, knowing what Andie is about to do, choose her, but do not tell Ben. So, the problem occurs in their relationship.

How to lose a guy in 10 days is one of the most romantic comedies in my opinion. Also the actors are really good. I mean, Matthew is an ok actor, he can be funny from time to time.

Of course- it is part of the bet they made to go out and systmatically go out and destroy eachother's lives. The story is predictable and Matthew in my opinon is the actor that lights up the screen- really it's Hudson who fails to deliever.

Hudson is a reporter that is doing an article called ""How to lose a guy in ten day"" and is trying to get Macanahy to break up with her in ten days.

I think we all see where this is going.  At first, the two can't stand each other.  Then they start to fall in love, etc.  The ending is very predictable.

The worst thing about this movie is that it is a blantant Budweiser advertisement.  While watching the movie, count how many times you see a character holding a bottle of Bud or how many Budweiser advertisements there are--it will give you something to do while sitting through this boring movie while your girlfriend watches attentively.  Budweiser, you may be The King of Beers, but this isn't the way to attract women to drink.

Hudson kept me wondering what crazy things she was going to do next to drive McConaghey away.  My favorite scene is when Hudson and McConaghey sing their own version of the song ""You're so vain,"" it is so funny.  I think all of the things Hudson did to drive McConaghey away are hilarious and the way McConaghey reacted to the way she was acting is so funny and kept me interested in the movie. I admit, when I first went to see the movie, I thought it was going to be a sappy love movie, but it is not at all.  Although, it is a romantic movie in a way, the comedy keeps it less emotional and corny.  It makes you want to laugh at one time and then it is so sweet the next minute.  I love it!

Here's a highly predictable, yet cute romantic comedy.  I have to wonder if these sorts of situations actually occur in real life, but they seem to happen all of the time in the movies.  Andie Anderson (Kate Hudson) is a columnist at Composure Magazine.  She writes the ""How To"" column intended for a female audience (Composure is similar to Cosmo or Glamour).  The column she agrees to write for the current month is ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"".  She has to find a guy and start dating him, but intentionally make all the classic mistakes that women make in relationships.  These mistakes will cause the guy to dump Andie in 10 days or less, which is just in time for Andie to finish her column and get it published.
Benjamin Barry (Matthew McConaughey) works in advertising.  He is very good at what he does, but he is known for working on ""guy"" related campaigns.  Ben wants to land his company's largest client, a diamond company, but he is seen as not having the right expertise and style for it.  Ben is very good at selling himself and convinces his boss that he can get any woman to fall in love with him (being able to do this is similar to being able to sell diamonds, apparently).  His boss gives him ten days, until a party that his boss is throwing for the new client.  Benjamin has to be able to prove to his boss that the woman he brings to the party has truly fallen in love with him.
Out of all of the people in New York City, Andie and Ben are going to meet at the perfect time to start dating and try to work out their conflicting assignments.  How this happens is moderately clever, and is actually believable if convenient.  Andie tries to get Ben to break up with her, though in a cute non-threatening way.  Ben is trying to get Andie to fall in love with him, so is willing to put up with everything that Andie throws at him.
""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" is incredibly predictable, but it is still an enjoyable movie.  Nothing is a surprise, but it is cute and slick and Andie and Ben are two very likable characters.  Sure, the movie is not very plausible and not very realistic, but cuteness and likeability goes a long way.

I recently saw a ""chick flick"" How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. Normally i wnjoy chick flicks and horror movies. So this one wasn't a big change for me although it is my favorite one yet. This particular movie is one of my favorite because it is halarious I laughed through out the whole movie. Kate Hudson does a wonderful job in this movie, along with Matthew McCaughy. I also think that anyone would like this movie (including guys) and I hope that you will go see it if u have not already.
This movie is loosely based on the book How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days: The Universal Don't Of Dating by Michele Alexander and Jeannie Long. How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is about a guy named Benjamin Barrie (Matthew McCaughey) who is a mortorcycle riding, love 'em and leave 'em type personality. the hotshot copywriter is a renowned love hound at Warren A dvertising and his inability to settle down has caused his boss (Robert Klein) to assign the DeLaurer Diamonds account to his nemesis, Team Judy (Michael Michele and Shalom Harlow). swearing that he can get any woman to fall deeply in love with him in ten days until the official copyrighting assignment is announced at a lavish party, Team Judy sics him on the woman they know he can never land. this woman happens to be Andie Anderson (Kate Hudson), writer of ""How To"" column at Cosmo like Composer Magazine.

1852046,4,B00008KDGZ,"Well, this was a pretty good movie... I rented it and watched it with my landlord last Thursday. I still have a lot of unanswered questions after seeing it, though. If the two main characters have such successful jobs as a magazine writer and advertising agent, how do they have time to play this silly dating game, plus have time to hang out with friends, get groceries, work out (as they are obviously in great shape), pick out and purchase a small dog, all in the span of 10 days? I come home after work and I'm exhausted.
After the ""game"" is revealed and the two characters look like they aren't going to get together, a very vulgar word is used by one character to stir up thoughts of a fun time they had together playing a game of the very same vulgar name.  I felt that the use of the word probably wouldn't have convinced the second character to get back together with him, as she didn't seem particularly fond of profanity. However, this probably wouldn't have made for a good movie.
Some of the movie is shot on what is supposed to be Staten Island. Now, I have not been there, and perhaps they didn't actually shoot the house and street scenes on Staten Island, but I found it to be quite nice.  I wish I knew if that was what it was really like there, what with the nice views of the city and all.
Finally, I was particular impressed at the choice the use ""Follow You Down"" by Gin Blossoms for the climactic motorcycle scene in the end.  It was a choice that was obviously well-thought out by the director. Now, whenever I hear that song, I think about driving my motorcycle over a bridge out of Manhattan. Except that I don't own a motorcycle, nor have I ever driven on a bridge out of Manhattan.
In closing, Kate Hudson is really cute, that helps the viewer to really get attached to her and want to see if she gets her guy in the end, and Chris Robinson should hold on to her like a black crow on a carcass.",1082937600,,1922,4.274725274725275

This film is about Andie and Benjamin. Andie is a magazine writer. She needs to write an article how you can lose a guy in 10 days, like many women do and about Benjamin is advertise executive, who bets that he can make woman fall in love with him in 10 days. For that he would get the best bussiness deal he ever imagined. The woman, who is sopossed to fall in love with him is Andie, who does nearly everything you can imagine, so that he would break up with her.
This film is for everybody who loves a good romantic comedy.
Believe me, you won't be sorry.

Plus I found a couple of parts of it highly offensive.  Right after they start dating, one of his co-workers makes a comment that maybe she's Bipolar.  I know someone who's Bipolar, and apparently the writers have no idea how something like that can totally ruin a person's life.  Also, further into the movie, when she goes to meet his parents, he jokes about part of the family being ""mental cases"", and that they ""all have Tourettes"".  People who have Tourettes who would have seen this movie must have been so thrilled by that comment.
Apparently the writers decided at that point that they had no other group of people to offend, so they offend us all by making a dull, boring, predictable movie that was a complete waste of time.  Near the end I actually felt embarrassed for the actors for having to do this film.

Kate Hudson played the part of a magazine writer given the task of dating a guy, picked at random, and trying to make as many mistakes possible to drive him crazy, to the point of calling the relationship off.  Just so happens that Matthew McConaughey is an advertising exec who just made a bet that he can get any woman to fall head over heels for him in a matter of 10 days.  Kate Hudson does all the little things that women naturally do to aggrivate men.  Some of the stunts were a bit unrealistic but funny all the same.  Clingy, baby voices, a pet dog, and even putting female products all over the bathroom.  The movie points out how aggrivating women can sometimes be and the things men will go through to keep us happy.  The ending was a bit predictible but it still brought out the best laughs.

Kate Hudson is cute, cute, cute - but methinks she twinkles too much in her attempts to be the cute daughter of cute Goldie Hawn.
This is a fluff-nutter of a movie with some good lines and some very funny scenes, but it's not going to have staying power. It's the equivalent of a very light summer beach read. The premise is silly: Hudson, a mag writer in NY, is assigned to date a guy and deliberately do all the things that drive guys nuts and send them scurrying away fast, fast, fast. The hooker: she's picked Matthew McConaughey, an ad exec who has accepted a bet at very high stakes that he can make a women fall in love with him in 10 days.
Of course, you already know how it ends; this is light romantic fodder, after all. Sure, watch it with some gal pals - but don't look for it on Oscar night, that's for sure.",1080259200,3,838,4.179012345679013
1852073,4,B00008KDGZ,"I'm not quite sure where to start with this one. I didn't have high expectations, after seeing the trailer, but I thought it was an interesting premise, so finally I rented it. My initial skepticism was promptly validated. Until about 2/3 of the way through the movie I was going to write a rather scathing review and certainly not give it more than a 3.0 rating. The basic plotline is this: Andie Anderson (Kate Hudson) writes a ""How to"" column for a rather flaky looking magazine that usually covers topics like clothes, diets, dating, etc. Her current topic is ""How to lose a guy in 10 days,"" and she's made a bargain with her boss that if she can successfully drive a man away in that amount of time, she'll finally be able to write about issues that really matter - politics, religion, etc.
Meanwhile, Benjamin Barry (Matthew McConaughey) works in advertising, and is desperate to be the one appointed to handle a contract with a huge diamond company. While trying to persuade his boss that he's the right man for the job, the topic of selling diamonds is somehow made synonymous with Ben's ability to sell himself to any woman alive. His boss agrees that he can have the job if he can make a woman (picked by two of his co-workers) fall madly in love with him in the next ten days. He agrees. The co-workers pick a woman out of the crowd and, big surprise, it's Andie. The two begin to date, with Andie doing everything she possibly can to drive him mad, and Ben doing everything he can think of to win her heart. Predictably, they end up falling for each other, and much professional and internal conflict ensues.
As I said earlier, the first 2/3 of the film did little to win me over. Most of the characters seemed just too incredibly fake to care about, particularly Andie. The makers of the film took a big gamble, whether they know it or not. The power of romantic comedies comes from having the audience truly wanting the two protagonists to get together in the end. Here, Andie comes across as a cold, calculating snob for much of the first part of the movie, while Ben is a cocky, arrogant playboy. I just didn't feel like rooting for either of them.
It's not until the sequence where Ben takes Andie to Staten Island to meet his family that the two really begin to seem like caring, feeling beings. At that point the characters' emotions were much more genuine, and the story began to pick up. From there on I really liked the film, even though the very end was perhaps a little too contrived ... But the chemistry really does come through in the latter part of the film, and thus I raised my rating to a generous four stars.
The acting is fairly good all around, despite the fact that most of Andie's co-workers are rather stereotypical scatterbrains who live on emotional roller coasters and think the world is made better by a cup of coffee and new clothes. I'm not sure whether their characters were supposed to be genuine or satire, but either way it adds some comic value to the film. I particularly liked the scenes with Ben's family, as the interactions there seemed the most genuine, and the people there the most real (they're a bit odd at times, granted, but don't most families have their quirks?).
DVD features include director commentary, a ""Mapping Out the Perfect Movie"" sequence with cast and crew interviews that provide extra insight into the film, deleted scenes (most of which I'm glad were not included in the actual film), a ""Mapping Out the Perfect Location"" featurette, and a music video of the song ""Somebody Like You."" My parting advice: If you don't like romantic comedies to begin with, don't see this movie. It's [probably] not the one that will win you over to the genre. If you do like romantic comedies (or even if you just have a thing for Matthew McConaughey), it's worth seeing, though it isn't the best. I'd advise renting it first to decide if you really like it or not.",1080000000,,3923,4.5502121640735504

Needless to say, you come in with little to no expectations.  For this movie, I expected to get some reading done, but found myself watching the movie and getting a laugh or two.
Business agendas and love do not go together, and this movie highlights that fact.  While Matthew McConaughey is trying to win an account by getting someone to fall in love with him, Kate Hudson is writing a story about losing a guy in just ten days.  In both cases, they are not in complete control.  Kate's editor tells her she must write the story while Matthew's competitors choose his girlfriend.
The comedy comes in what should be a romp through the things that a woman may do to scare a man off; however, the true comedy comes in the patience the man shows when the woman's tactics get a little unbelievable.  The tactics, like planning their wedding and life together after only having been dated a few days, seem a bit much.  The characters seem to know that this is extreme and because of this, I don't think the extremity hurt the movie.  Just trying to cope good naturedly takes everything they have.

Don was awesome, this movie however is not.
I could not get through more than 30 minutes.  Other than the fact that the film is shot in NYC, I could find anything good about this movie to continue watching it.
Kate Hudson is completely overrated, almost talentless.  She's a young version of Goldie Hawn, her real Mom, but somehow missing a chromosome.  Know what I mean?
The premise... a ""serious"" journalist that works for a ""Cosmo"" like magazine (why does she even work there?) sets out to date a guy and write an article abut it.  ""Doing all the things that men hate"" so he will want to dump her.  I vaguely remember from the trailer: TAMPON humor... gee what man doesn't like those?  <GASP>.
Without even seeing the entire film, you know Hudson is going to fall for MM.  SURPRISE! I can only speculate that the two did not have ANY chemistry onscreen at all.
Perhaps the film may have been better in the hands of a female director, but let's just say that whomever directed this mess would have failed.

This movie was pure fluff.  Very predictable from start to finish.  I hated how everything ended so nice and neatly at the end.

1852104,1,B00008KDGZ,"(It would be 1 1/2 stars). Someone told my mother this was funny, so about 8 of us PAID MONEY to see it in the theatre.  The characters were really shallow, and deserved each other...how is this romantic?  It's as if there were a horrible arranged marriage, and then people did everything they could to make the life of the other person miserable.
The one great moment in the film is when Kate Hudson shows up in that beautiful yellow dress, if I were thousands of dollars richer, I would've loved it to be my prom dress...
Now more bad stuff, so Kate Hudson's character ends up losing the bet or whatever, and really drunkenly embarrasses herself.  What really bothered me is the focus that the movie spent on her job and her career, that is why she is doing all this... then she leaves her job and gets an interview in DC for a job she's really always wanted ...gets stopped by our hero on a motorcycle who says 'hey babe, I kinda liked you, despite the fact that neither I (nor the audience) knows the real you, what's say you blow off the interview and get a job in New York so then you can jump on my bike and we'll ride off into the sunset. (Hello! Obviousman says that if it were that easy to just get a job in New York, she would have done so, rather than work at that trashy fashion magazine, but its time to end the movie and women's jobs aren't important anyway, or that's the current lesson in romantic comedies these days...) The other reason that this movie got 1 1/2 stars is that it still managed to be better than Kate and Leopold, (which another reviewer mentioned the similiarity to as well). Movies like these give not just chick films, but women in general a bad name, I mean jeez...let's just go rent Matrix 3 or something.",1074729600,4,1745,4.330275229357798
1852105,2,B00008KDGZ,"It's my own fault that I had higher expectations of this film, but I'm guessing that this movie was not exactly made for guys like me anyway. The acting is ok, Matthew McConaughey's character Ben and Kate Hudson's Andie really just have to act and react. The dialog doesn't matter. Kate Hudson's character always has the upperhand, which is fine for a while, but after an hour it gets tiring. She completely invades every aspect of Ben's life; we never even see Andie's world besides her two friends and workplace. So while both characters have a similar agenda, there is a complete imbalance of upperhandedness, and this to me is the film's greatest shortcoming. He puts up with all her attempts in 'losing him', but all this only produces frustration in Andie - and fuels her to do crazier things. As a viewer you're dying to see her fall on her face just once. But that's wishful thinking. Ben's resilience to Andie's antics barely entertains me, and Andie's total lack of shame does not endear her to me. Sure they both look great, and Hudson positively beams when she smiles, but man, 112 minutes is a long time to endure this game.
I can imagine some people thinking this movie is great. Girl Power and all. I don't know. But I think we can agree the movie was conceived as a vehicle for Kate Hudson's rise to stardom.
This movie reminds me a bit of WHAT WOMEN WANT (with Mel Gibson) for a variety of reasons but notably because it was written & produced by women - which in the male-dominated movie world is a much needed perspective - but Nancy Myers (the producer/director of What Women Want) is definitely a lot smarter than the 'brains' behind How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days. You only have to watch the DVD extras to see proof of this. We meet two of the producers, both of whom have obviously had facelifts. I'm serious. It's creepy. They talk about the material like it's Shakespeare. Then there is the director Donald Petrie, who totally lacks any charisma whatsoever. The MAKING OF with him is so cheaply done it's probably funnier to watch than most of the movie. While he sits there chatting, a TV monitor behind him fires off stills from the film, and a female office clerk (with her back to the camera) stares at a static PC screen while biting her nails and shaking her head a lot. She does this for the entire duration of the interviews with Petrie. Oh, and did I mention the background music that accompanies the extras? It's department store music. Or elevator music. Which ever one you hate more.
I didn't bother with the commentary. Donald is a bore.
There are no outtakes, which is by now unusual for a comedy.
The deleted scenes are actually good, some honest emotions are shown by Andie and we get a few more calm private moments between the two leads.
Look, it started off ok. It felt like it would be harmless fluffy romantic comedy, but the romance lasted about 10 minutes. I can sum up my review with this observation of director Petrie's reason he became interested in directing the movie. He says it was because he found out that Kate Hudson was attached to it. Aha. So basically, if the movie does well at the box office, then it will launch Hudson's AND his career. Sorry Petrie, but that's not good enough for me.",1074729600,7,3248,4.516129032258065

There's Andie (played perfectly by the adorable and lovable Kate Hudson) who is a writer for a fashion magazine. Then there's Ben (played by Matthew McConaughey-the part could not have went to a better male lead!) who's in advertising.
So as to not to give too much away there's two different bets going on from both parties. Andie's is to how to lose a guy in ten days by doing all the things girls do wrong in romantic relationships for her column she writes for the magazine. Ben's is to make a girl fall in love with him in 10 days and if he succeeds he gets the bit he's been wanting to do on diamonds at work. This twist brings Andie and Ben together in a whirlwind of hilarious situations and very amusing scenes. When the ten days are up what will happen?
I highly recommend this movie to any romantic comedy lovers~ Watch Kate Hudson at her best- this proves her acting skills are absolutely incredible!
For laughs and amusement this movie is a must! If you have not seen it I highly recommend you do very soon!

So, what makes this movie worth watching? First, the acting. Kate Hudson's blonde presence, great acting and a smile that could melt Stalin's heart, and McConnaughey's surprisngly good comic vein were great chemistry on screen. The supporting cast is also appropriated and funny. Second, the comic situations. There are lots of good jokes, and none of them is crude or low-level. I laughed hard at some scenes. Third, the dialogue. Fast, intelligent and coherent.

Kate Hudson plays an aspiring journalist who assigned a job at her less-than-serious-journalism-beauty-magazine called ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days."" Her assignment: Find a poor, unexpecting schmuck, make him fall in love overnight, and then do all the annoying little stereotypical quirks that girls do to push guys away - she must get rid of him in 10 days. Matthew M. plays an egotistical womanizing guy who makes a bet with his friends that he can make some poor unexpecting girl fall in love with him in 10 days. What a coincedence -shocker!- these two meet!!! Yeah, I know! I couldn't believe it, either! The rest of the movie is Kate Hudson doing everything she can to be annoying (she succeeds with flying colors!) and Matthew doing everything in his power to be a sweet, sensitive, and understanding boyfriend to try to make her fall for him. There are funny parts, and there are also extremely predictable and dull parts. But, the movie is saved by the acting of both Kate Hudson (who is too cute for words) and Matthew M. (um, hello? sexy as hell) I liked it. Not the best comedy of the year, but definitely worth watching.

The story, production and acting are all good, and the film is an old fashioned entertainment flick that keeps a smile or two on your face throughout its appx 110 minutes. However, what distinguished this film from dozens or so romantic comedies is Kate Hudson.
She made me enjoy the movie much more than I thought I would, and it is her best role to date, an actress who has matured well on screen,who is very pretty,cute, fresh, with a contagious smile that lights up the screen.

1852142,1,B00008KDGZ,"Why review this movie?  For the simple reason that I was stuck on an airplane for hours with nothing to do.  Against my better judgment I decided to check out this 'romantic comedy', a genre that has become a breeding ground for garbage in the past 20 years or so.
Should have known better.  If we want to call romantic comedies genre films, then this has all the pieces.  And like many genre films these days, it sucks, made of half-baked ideas or the same old ingredients baked to nauseating results.  Here's a movie about two people you would never know: he works at a super cool ad agency and has the type of office no one you know has, she works at a Cosmo-like magazine writing vapid columns for vapid people in a vapid office.  They both make bets with their respective bosses: he'll get a girl to fall in love with him in 10 days, and she'll get a guy to dump her in 10.  Want an easy solution to lose someone in a weekend?  Start here.
The characters are happy, beautiful people living in impossibly large Manhattan apartments in your typical romantic comedy New York (which means full of rich, pretty people and none of the grit of the real city).  They make a bet that they can basically ruin someone for the sake of their jobs, both of which are appropriately hollow professions (he is trying to sell diamonds to more women, she is doing columns for your typical New York society ice queen boss).  Of course this means we'll see him be the nicest guy on the planet (cooking, court side Knicks tickets )for her while she tries to make his life a living hell (buying a puntable little dog who does his business on the man's pool table, interrupting his poker night, etc.) But of course, he has to try and work it out as his job depends on it.  Meanwhile most men would have booted her and the dog in a jiffy.
The movie flat out insulted my intelligence.  It has the obligatory scene where he takes her to his humble beginnings, which in this case is Staten Island, a place they want to portray as more down to earth, romantic, homey, etc.  Blah.  Kate Hudson may be nice to look at but she has none of her mother's famous expressions and in general, she has about half the talent. Matthew Mc-whatever is his same down-home nice guy.
Romantic comedies do not have to be this sappy and cheesy and insulting.  Movies like this border on contempt for audiences. Who can relate to these characters?  Who cares in the end?  I guess it's a safe investment for a studio.  Avoid, unless you want to lose more respect for Hollywood in two hours.

Sparks fly, despite themselves, when Ben bets co-workers he can make any woman fall in love with him in 10 days (sorry McConaguhey in your dreams), likewise, Andie is asked to write a column on ""How to lose a guy in 10 days."" Both characters choose each other as the victim.
This is your typical humiliation comedy, with Ben playing the clueless straight man and Andie, as the ruthless antagonist. The role reversal was refreshing. I particularly liked the interaction between Ben and his co-workers.
On the downside, I thought the ending with Andie being portrayed as the 'sole guilty' party in this scheme was a little much. Okay, and Ben hadn't wagered on the end result? Come on.

It's an old, cookie-cutter plot with a minor twist in it.  Kate Hudson stars as a woman assigned to ditch a guy in 10 days.  She, of course, does things to irritate him and drive him away, all to no avail.  And guess what?  Surprise!!!! She falls in love with him.  Bet you couldn't see that coming a mile away.

1852158,3,B00008KDGZ,"Once upon a time, Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson appeared in fine dramatic roles. LONE STAR (1996) and A TIME TO KILL (1996) come to mind for the former, and ALMOST FAMOUS (2000) for the latter. HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS is a pleasant, but inconsequential, piece of fluff for both.
Hudson plays Andie, the How To girl for ""Composure"" magazine (a fictional ""Cosmopolitan""), and the writer of such articles as ""How to Beat A Traffic Ticket"". Inspired by her best girlfriend's bad luck with men, she volunteers to write a piece, HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS. As her boss (Bebe Neuwirth) puts it, ""Five days is too short, and the magazine goes to print in eleven."" Andie is to base her article on the exercise of attracting a single man, then employing her womanly wiles to drive him to dump her. (Hudson's real-life Mom, Goldie Hawn, would also have been perfect for the Andie role in her younger years.)
McConaughey is Ben, who works for an ad agency, and is out to convince his boss that he, not two female colleagues, is best able to devise an ad campaign for a major diamond wholesaler. Ben wins the assignment if he can make good on a bet, i.e. that he can make a woman fall in love with him in ten days.
Andie and Ben target each other at a party, and the battle of totally opposite agendas is on. At one point, as both gaze lovingly at each other, Andie's inner thought is revealed by a voiceover: ""I'm going to make you wish you were dead.""  Get the drift of the plot?
McConaughey and Hudson are both enormously attractive actors, and so this film is certainly not unpleasant. OK, ok - it's cute. Hudson's Andie is the meatier of the two roles, best seen when she intrudes on Ben's night of poker with his male buds. The script works - most of the time. There was only one sequence involving Ben, Andie, Ben's family and a game of cards called ""Bulls__t"" that was almost incomprehensible to me, a non-card player, and which perhaps was better left in the digital editor's virtual trash bin.
Despite the convoluted path getting there, the Hollywood ending should be obvious to anyone who's ever purchased a movie ticket. Both McConaughey and Hudson are capable and deserving of better. HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS is not the sort of film that will elevate either to the A List.",1063411200,,2290,4.42654028436019
1852159,2,B00008KDGZ,"I rented this movie expecting it to be a hilarious two hours of fun. Well, twenty minutes into it, I was waiting for it to end. I was waiting for the big laughs that never came. The storyline, when you think about it, is questionable: How do you make it funny, anyway? It's just weird. And not cool-weird or good-weird, just weird. Like impossible-weird. She's doing a magazine article on ""what not to do on a date"" and wants to drive away this guy in ten days. He wants to make her fall in love with him to prove to this people that he can make girls fall in love with the diamonds they're selling. So...she's trying to make him hate her, he's trying to make her love him. It's not that funny, it's simply a bit strange. I rented this with ""Bringing Down the House,"" and just as a comparison between two supposed comedies, I laughed hysterically throughout and thoroughly enjoyed the Queen Latifah/Steve Martin movie. This one, on the other hand, bored me. I stopped watching after about half an hour and I don't know how I could've kept going though another hour and a half of it. This is NOT the film it's made out to be...
There must have been SOME part I liked...for instance, the moment when she first gets the job of driving the guy away. From there, everything's downhill. I'm telling you this so you know what to expect from this film. If you trust alot of the ads for it, you'll be disappointed. And for those who weren't--I guess we have very different senses of humor. Because ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" didn't hold my attention at all. I didn't like it. The story is just bland and blah. I give it 2 stars out of five because...like, well...I don't know.

The same trademark giggle and cheeky grins are there, but for me Goldie has that certain X factor, and is definitely more well endowed than her daughter (and it shows). The story line is simple, and one I can empathize with as I am The Travelling Gourmet & I am a Travel, Food & Wine journalist. Kate is a journalist for a top womens' magazine in New York and for a story, she is assigned to write a piece (journalistic lingo for story or article) on ""How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days"" To do this her simple minded plan is to entice and ensnare a guy in a short while & then to dump him unceremoniously in 10 days. Of course, all sorts of funny and hilarious things happen in between like when she invades his bachelor pad with all her cuddly stuffed toys, bears and what have you! Also, she crashes his weekly Poker Party with the boys and creates havoc with her PMS tantrums. Then there is the classic scene where she tells him she is a vegetarian after he has slaved over a hot stove to cook her a gourmet meal of Lamb. Another classic is the restaurant scene where she accuses him falsely of calling her ""FAT"". What a guy, he is so tolerant he even falls in love with her! he is the Sensitive New Age Man personified. Well, who can blame him. She is undoubtedly beautiful, with or without cleavage. As star she is sure to rise and shine very fast in the future. I liked the portrayal of a HARD AS NAILS editor; very true to life. I have known editors like her, only better looking but still tough to the core beneath their designer power suits complete with immaculately varnished shocking red nails. The scenes in the magazine publishing house is very realistic, as is the scene where the stories are assigned to various writers during an Editorial meeting. I was thinking as I watched, ""Is it Art imitating Life, or vice versa, or both??"" The twist is that the guy also has underhand plans of his own to get a plum advertising account for a Diamond tycoon. What a world! To do this he has to prove he can ensnare Kate with his macho charms. Anyway, to cut a long story short, true LOVE wins in the end and triumphs over all obstacles. This only goes to show you how true the motto of the SAS is as WHO DARES WINS! I watched this with someone I love very much, and I recommend you watch this with someone you love very much too.

1852161,3,B00008KDGZ,"Although this film has captured the hearts of many young fans, I found this film satisfactory. There are bits and pieces in the movie that were funny but in the end, I realized that Kate Hudson was the only good thing in the movie. The script gave a good comedic effort but all in all, it turns out to be too predictable and ruins all the excitement and surprise of going to the movies.
Kate Hudson is the only one who glows in the movie with her excellent performance as Andie Anderson, the ""How to..."" girl for a local magazine called ""Composure."" In order to write her next article, ""How to lose a guy in 10 days,"" Andie goes about to find her a man she can use as a guinea pig. Hudson's facial expressions and various voices she displays in the movie demonstrates what an accomplished actress she has become. Kate is very convincing as Andie and she can even light up a movie with a dry plot.
Matthew McConaughey portrays the smooth talking advertising executive who takes on a bet that he can make any girl fall in love with him in 10 days. McConaughey's dreary performance in the film makes his character have no life and live in the shadow of Kate Hudson's performance. McConaughey's Texan accent also doesn't suit well with his New York character.
The DVD special features are all consisted of the usuals (previews, scene selections, languages, etc.) and many little featurettes. They include the directors, actors, producers point of view on the characters and the actors/ actresses who play them. The DVD has featurettes about characters like Andies friends, Bens buddies, the  Judys, Andie and Bens Boss, and of course, Andie and Ben. Theres also a map of New York and special spot on location featurettes. Theres places like Staten Island, Bens ad agency, Andies Composure headquarters, Bens loft, Andies apartment, the Brooklyn Bridge and other various locations. The extras are pretty good and give you a good behind the scenes look on the movie.
The film overall was ok with occasional quirks. However, after watching all the previews and the critical raves, this movie was not as good as I expected. The selection of actors and actresses who were chosen to play the parts in the movie were good choices with the exception of Matthew McConaughey. The script was ok but with a few confusing parts. Even though the movie is known as the ultimate chick flick for guys, I still find this like any other romance comedy- dull with no plot.

1852164,5,B00008KDGZ,"... Start with a good script that includes a twist, and add good acting and as much humor as possible.  This movie has these elements.  Kate Hudson plays a ""How To"" columnist for a fluffy women's mag, but she really wants to write about serious subjects.  She is trying to impress her boss (Bebe Newirth) enough to earn free reign on her writing.  In this process and after her coworker whines incessantly about being dumped, Hudson opts to write a reverse How To on what turns guys off.  She must find a guy that will fall for her, then do everything that women do wrong in relationships.  Concurrently, Matthew McConaghey plays a sharp-shooting, go-getter ad exec who has thus far worked predominantly in the sports arena.  He would like to break into the very lucrative world of jewelry.  What stands in his way?  Two lovely ladies who believe they can do it better, and have the ear of McConaghey's boss.  McConaghey makes a bet that he can make any woman fall in love with him in 10 days, in order to prove his adeptness at knowing and being able to speak to the female mind.  His opposition, having overheard Hudson's latest assignment, pick her seemingly randomly as McConaghey's target, thinking he's sure to lose.  This is how the couple comes together.  The rest of the movie is how they come apart ... and it's funny.  Actually, it's almost uncomfortably funny.  Your sides will split in laughter in parts of the movie.  Plus, you'll wonder how Kate Hudson ever managed to get through the embarrassingly funny things she did in her attempt to scare off unsuspecting McConaghey.  Kate's performance is perfect.  In the end, as you just have to know, the truth unravels with the unwitting help of McConaghey's sidekicks.  All in all, this movie has everything ... a good plot, good acting, lots of laughs, and ample chemistry.  This one is a must for the avid romantic comedy collector.  (and guys should like it too)
As for the DVD itself ... The deleted scenes aren't bad to watch, but the movie wasn't missing anything for having left them on the cutting room floor.

1852165,2,B00008KDGZ,"Thank God for beautiful women.  I especially thank God for my fianc.  Its just too darn bad she has such conventional taste in movies.  So of course I have gotten very used to the occasional chick flick.  They make her laugh, even if I don't get it or care too.  They fill her with glee but they fill me with loathing.  But every once and while a chick flick comes along that is so conventional, and so silly.  That Im am filled with Apathy instead of loathing.  So I guess thats the only way to describe HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN TEN DAYS: a conventional film that filled with apathy.
Like every romantic comedy 10 DAYS tells the story of two beautiful people and how they get to know each other, falling in and out of love with each other, and then telling there less attractive friends about how happy they are.
In this film those two people are Andie Anderson (Kate Hudson, Almost Famous) and Ben Barry (Matthew McConaughy, EDTV), they are so adorable their first names have that same first letter as their last name (they might want to shoot their parents).  They each meet under dubious circumstances, she has to write and article about the mistakes women make while dating, and he has to make her fall in love with him to win an advertising account.  So of course in the process they both fall in love and wild comedic scenes take place.
What works in the film are Hudson and McConaughy, they have really nice chemistry together.  They have a really sweet conversation when they first meet. It is constructed with just pithy little statements, and it is both silly and charming.  Hudson also relishes torturing McConaughy with her silly dating games.  The scene in which she breaks up the boys poker game really enchanted me.  Not a terribly inspired scene but it has a really nice comedic tone.  So at least it worked for me.
I also liked the scene at Bens parents house.  The game of B.S. was inspired.  This scene works because for once the colorful family doesnt act like buffoons.  This scene is also much too good for this movie.
I just hated that the film was so conventional.  In the course of an hour and forty minutes, they meet, fall in love, fall out of love, and realize they both really love each other and live happily ever after.  Its plot is constructed out of every romantic comedy cliche ever made.
What also bothered me was that our two star-crossed lovers are far to good for the material.  The concept would work without sitcom jokes and witty one liners; but of course in Hollywood unconventional ...  If you are looking for a good night out with your lady friend, 10 DAYS will make her smile.  But may I recommend a better romantic comedy, Benny and Joon.

1852195,4,B00008KDGZ,"I'm spending my summer renting DVDs like a nutjob.  I rotate between dark and dramatic, random indies and silly lighthearted affairs.  How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days falls in the ""silly lighthearted affairs"" category, but that's not to say it is a bad movie.
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is a cute romantic comedy.  Kind of gave me the same feeling as when I watched ""The Wedding Planner"".  Matthew McConaughey played the EXACT same character he played in The Wedding Planner, all over again.  So, if you've seen The Wedding Planner, you know what you're going to get from Matthew.  Kate Hudson's character is a sweet yet sophisticated (and at some points annoying, like when she was trying to get Matthew's character to dump her) young woman.  She did as much with the role as she possibly could, given the simplicity of the plot and script.  I'm waiting for Kate Hudson to take on more challenging roles as I believe she has the ability to become an amazing actress.",1058918400,,966,4.511494252873563
1852196,5,B00008KDGZ,"""How To Loose a Guy in 10 Days,"" despite it's somewhat morally disturbing premise is an enjoyable film.  Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson have great chemistry on-screen and the supporting cast does an awesome job of telling this somewhat simple, yet oddly enough sweet, story.
THE STORY:
Andie Anderson (Hudson), a rising journalist for women's magazine Composure is assigned to write an article on ""How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days"" whereby she is to date some poor fellow and attempt to drive him off within 10 days.
In order to secure a lucrative account, Advertising account executive Ben Barry makes a bet with his boss that he can make any woman fall in love with him in 10 days.
Through some slight manipulation both Andie and Ben wind up hooked up with each other and seek to achieve both their ends, she to drive him off in 10 days, he to win her over.  Hilarity ensues as Andie seeks to drive Ben away while Ben struggles to cling onto the ever (seemingly) increasingly illogical Andie.
THE COOL STUFF:
While the premise of both Andie and Ben merely using each other for their own ends can be a little off-putting, the execution of the story is flawless and really enjoyable.  The situations that Andie and Ben and their cast of friends get themselves into are hilarious and the tender moments that Ben and Andie share (particularly when they visit Ben's family) are just really enjoyable moments.  Overall, it's just a nice film to have a good laugh and an ""awwwww"" moment at.
Best Scenes:
1. Visit to Ben's folks
2. The Poker Game
THE DVD FEATURES:
Much like the film itself, the DVD features are a little sparse in variety, but very deep in content.  Truly, the amount of features, more than many other DVDs put out, offer strong insight and background on the film and are alone well worth the DVD purchase.  For your viewing and listening pleasure on this DVD are:
1. Director's Commentary track:  Standard fare, but always insightful
2. ""Mapping the Perfect Movie"" - These are a series of approximately 4 minute featurettes talking about each member of the cast and crew where they talk about each actor/filmmaker talking about things such as casting or working with each other.  Great stuff overall and easily outshines the standard ""actor/filmmaker biography/filmography we usually get.
3. 5 deleted scenes with optional director commentary track
4. ""Mapping the Perfect Location"" - Much like ""Mapping the Perfect Movie"" these are approximately 4 minute individual featurettes discussing each of the major sets used in this movie.  You'll get insights into how the sets were either built or selected including the scene scouting process used in film-making.  Again, great stuff overall.
5. Music video - ""Somebody Like You"" by Keith Urban.  Standard fair.  Nice country influenced track with some great footage from the film and band.
6. 3 trailers
THE VERDICT:
Overall, ""How To Loose A Guy in 10 Days"" is just a nice romantic comedy.  Again, the premise built on deception is a little disturbing but the execution in this movie is just flawless.  The humor and hilarious situations our cast find themselves in our witty and brilliant and the metamorphosis of Andie and Ben's relationship into true love is just beautifully done.  This makes a great watch for couples who need a nice laugh.  The insight DVD extras make this a fine choice for purchase if you are so inclined.
Grades:
The Movie:  4 stars
The Extras:  5 stars
Overall:  4.5 stars

1852197,3,B00008KDGZ,"Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey star in this romantic comedy that is pretty funny but ultimately not very memorable. Andie (Kate Hudson) is a ""How to"" writer in a fashion magazine, who wants more creative control over what she writes. She wants to write about serious global issues. She is assigned to write an article about how to lose a guy in 10 days. Ben (Matthew McConaughey) is in advertising and bets his boss that he can make a  woman fall in love with him in 10 days in order to win an advertising gig. Pretty predictable what goes on from here. At a party they both choose each other.
So Andie does everything that women do wrong in relationships to try to drive him away, while he is trying to make her fall in love with him, at the same time. It's like whiplash in a way. Some moments are funny, but ultimately it was just very silly. Kate Hudson was great in the role though, while Matthew McConaughey just played the same role he plays in all of his movies. It was a fun romantic comedy, but not one of the best ones.",1058745600,3,1035,4.3076923076923075
1852198,4,B00008KDGZ,"""How to lose a guy in 10 days"" is a romantic, genuinely funny movie. The plot centers on Andie Anderson, a columnist for a Cosmo style magazine, who is writing a column on ""how to lose a guy in 10 days."" The guy she wants to lose-Matthew McConaghy's Ben, a hotshot ad executive. What she doesn't know: Ben has made a bet with his co-workers (who knew of Andie's column) that he can keep a woman for 10 days.
The things that Andie does to lose him are very funny (e.g., redecorate his home). If you're a woman, some of them hit a little too close to home. Both actors are loaded with charm. Of course, the plot takes a predictable course-they are each other's true destinies etc. But you have a lot of fun on the way.
The DVD is excellent. The director's commentary is insightful and useful. The deleted scenes should have been deleted but they are still fun to watch.
I recommend this move for all who love the romantic comedy genre. Guys may enjoy it-as they may recognize certain female tactics!",1058745600,,997,4.394594594594595

1852216,2,B00008KDGZ,"My roommate bought this movie. That is the only reason I watched it. That, and Kate Hudson. I think that she is too adorable. I was a little disappointed that she chose a project like this, but I thought, ""Maybe she could improve it?"" A little bit.
Andi Anderson is a journalist for a womans magazine that focuses mostly on ""Cosmopolitan"" type issues. Fat, fit, fun, fabulous.. basically cheesy. She wants to write more serious issues, like politics, poverty, etc. Currently, she writes a monthly article called ""How to..."" Her friend has been broken up with. She made all of the mistakes you make in a relationship that has been going on for a week. Andi decides to save her friends butt and herself, and write ""How to lose a guy in 10 days,"" at her bosses request.
Ben is an advertising exec, who is cool and cocky. He wants this assignment for diamonds, big client. He somehow lets out that he can make any woman fall in love with him. Somehow, his boss and the supermodels he works with come up with a bet that will set him out to make ""any"" girl (Kate Hudson) fall in love with him, in 10 days. They will find out the results at the ""diamond"" party. Can he do it? Can she make him leave? The results, at least, started out to be interesting.
She goes about, making all of the mistakes women make to chase men away. I have to admit, this was the best part of the movie.
These are some tricks she tries:
*Making him go for soda the last few minutes of a Knicks game.
*Telling him that she doesn't eat meat after he has made lamb and making him go to a vegetarian place and eat barley and tofu.
*Bringing pink objects to decorate his place and stuffed animals to live on his couch and bed.
*Acting like a happy lovey puppy all of the time, then crying the next minute for no reason.
You get the idea. Good concept, but could have been carried through a little bit better.
Anyway, the end turns out to be predictable and formulaic, but I did get something from it. I'm sure there will come a time where Kate Hudson can't help the movie by acting adorable. She did help it enough to keep me there, but not enough to keep me from making fun of it. See her as Penny Lane in Almost Famous. That was the best!",1057708800,,2205,4.26491646778043
1852217,5,B00008KDGZ,"Romantic ""chick flicks"" are a dime a dozen these days, but only a few of them are worth even mentioning. This, surprisingly, is one of them. Kate Hudson is adorable as Andie Anderson - the author of a monthly ""How to..."" guide in Composure magazine. While she wants to be a serious reporter covering such things as politics, her boss just wants her to cover fluff on losing weight, fashion, dating, etc. So she gives in once again, and decides to write an anti-dating article, entitled ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" - in other words, be as annoying as you can to the guy you're dating until he dumps you. Meanwhile, Matthew McConaughey's character, Ben, has made a bet that he can make Andie fall in love with him in 10 days (he, of course, knows nothing about her little scheme, and vice versa). What ensues is a silly movie, but sweet and often funny.
Like I said before, there are so many romantic comedies out there that are dull and unemotional. Recent movies, such as 'Maid in Manhattan', try so hard to be funny, sweet and tear-jerking at the same time, but fail. But not this one. I actually found myself rooting for the two main characters - both of whom I really liked. Kate Hudson does an incredible job going from the slightly psychotic Andie to the fun and sane Andie, and Matthew McConaughy makes great chick flick material (which we found out in 'The Wedding Planner' - if only it had been a better movie). 'How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days' has quickly moved on to my list of favorite romantic comedies. And guess what, girls? You can probably even get your boyfriends to watch it with you. I watched it with my boyfriend (who does not consider himself a fan of the chick flick genre), and he seemed to enjoy it as well. I highly recommend it.",1057622400,,1756,4.389570552147239

The first 45-60 minutes of the movie were pretty funny, after that it really began to drag and I wished it would end.  It was sad to see two very talented and attractive actors with such possibility for chemistry, go to waste on such a bad script.  I give the movie 1 3/4 stars.",1057536000,2,584,4.052173913043478

Kate Hudson is hysterical and proves she is a gifted comedian and while Matthew doesn't really do anything different than what he usually does, he still turns in one of his best performances helped by the energetic Hudson. It took a little too long to get them finally together, but the end is sweet and worth it.

I wished I could have seen it in theatres - How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days is one of the cutest and funniest romantic comedies I've ever seen. The twist - the male character trying to get the woman to love him, and the female character trying to drive him away - it totally original and exceptionally funny.
The movie involves just a touch of sexual content, but it's nothing extreme, and can be considered mild compared to the other things you see nowadays. It's sweet and understandable. In one scene, the female character mentions that she wants the male character's respect, and he follows through loyally.
Even though it gets boring in a couple spots, Kate Hudson provides great comic relief in the most unexpected times. I'm rated this movie 4-star because it sort of drags near the end, but overall, this is a great movie and it's worth watching.",1057104000,,983,4.559322033898305

The appearance of Marvin Hamlisch was unexpected, but I was disappointed that we only got to hear a intro to ""One"" from his undoubtedly most popular show, A Chorus Line.  Kate is hilarious.

1852246,1,B00008KDGZ,"Maid in Manhattan, Two Weeks Notice, Just Married, and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days say it all about this new tick of which movie makers are beginning to pick up today. This movie in particular is a sole example of the decreasing talent of those on today's stage. Besides Mcconaughey, who is considered from the better generation, the rest of the actors in this film give new definition to acting that is well below mediocrity. Have the pools of original ideas dried out already? The very point of romance comedies is to have something of which people may be able to identify with, and in this case, nothing portrays reality. The idea itself is inexcusable and the interaction between the characters is more of a cartoon style that is more appealing to little girls. Its either just me, or the public has become increasingly fond of low-budget, low-standard movies.",1053734400,4,865,4.697368421052632

1852248,4,B00008KDGZ,"The storyline itself indeed, has been done before, and yet this is a fantastic movie.
I loved every minute of it.
Why is this?
The acting was superb!
I absolutely adore Kate Hudson. She is cute, beautiful,sexy , sensual , funny and clever-I love those eyes
And I can surely see why a guy would stick by her, whatever she did to try make him leave her.
Even when she tries to be irritating she is cute, unlike so many others who try to be cute but are irritating &#61514;
Her role as Andie Anderson is a masterpiece.
Matthew McConaughey (who plays advertising executive Ben Barry) is also a superb actor, whose easy arrogance, is carried off well, if not somewhat unnerving.
Highly watchable, and extremely funny.
Particularly memorable are the scene with the 'psychologist' and the verbal catfight on stage between Andy and Ben.
Another noteworthy performance is that of Andie's best friend Michelle by
Katharyn Hahn - she gives an earthy and hilarious performance.",1053216000,,965,4.819277108433735

The best part is watching the two main characters Andie (Kate Hudson) and Ben (Matthew McConaughey) date each other not realizing of the fact that Kate needs to try to dump him for her article whilst Ben needs to provide proof of true love to win his ad campaign.  As silly as it sounds I think that the ""game playing"" that the two are doing is something that is done in real life and only when you move past the game playing and find yourself head over heels does real love occur...just like Andie and Ben find out in the movie.",1053043200,,560,4.224299065420561
1852250,3,B00008KDGZ,"I usually write longer reviews, but I'm going to make this short and quick as that's the feeling I got from this movie. First of all, the premise is that a young woman is given an assignment to get a guy and then lose him in 10 days. Likewise, a guy has been given a bet that he must make this same woman fall in love with him (yet neither of them knows what the other is doing). The result is that she's desperately trying to make him drop her by being incredibly annoying, and he's trying to stick it out. Of course, by the end they determine the truth, yet have fallen in love with one another, etc., etc.
It is definitely a ""chic flick,"" and as such, there are certainly formalic and cliche plot twists. However, that said, it does seem to raise the bar from your even more generic, run-of-the-mill, romantic comedy. I only go to these movies to appease my wife (HONEST!) and there are these kinds of movies out there that I've watched where I wish someone would have blown my brains out instead. But to be honest, I have to admit that by the end of this particular movie, I had been entertained, I did laugh, and the overall premise was somewhat unique, even for as gimmicky as it was. Therefore, if you like ""chic flicks"" you'll love this one. And for those guys who don't like them -- trust me... you could do a lot worse than this one, so if that special woman in your life has been pushing you to attend one of ""these movies"" with her, pick this one.",1051747200,,1459,4.232974910394265

The actions eventually were there, but when did he leave the bet behind and realize that it was no longer his motivation?  I would have liked to have seen that moment.

Andie is tasked by her editor to find a man, start a relationship with him, and the do the stereotypical things that drive men away (for instance, redecorating his apartment with stuffed animals, using baby talk).  The result of her experiment will become the subject of her next column.  Ben Barry (Matthew McConaughey) is an advertising executive who, in order to win a major account, bets that he can win the heart of any woman.  These two characters target each other for their article and bet, and the movie sets off on its predictable path.
Don't get me wrong: I did enjoy the movie.  Hudson and McConaughey have good chemistry, and are supported by an excellent ensemble that includes a good performance by Bebe Neuwirth as Andie's editor.  The things that Hudson's character contrives to drive Ben away are often humorous, and the lengths to which Ben goes to tolerate Andie's behavior are also funny.
The rest of this paragraph may be considered a SPOILER by anyone who hasn't seen a Hollywood movie in the last decade.  My problem with the movie is that the plot is based on a well used formula where one character manipulates another into falling in love, then becomes emotionally attached to his or her ""target,"" and faces heartbreak when the ""target"" discovers that they are being used.  The only twist to this formula is that both characters are using each other.

1852267,4,B00008KDGZ,"""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" is a truly delightful little movie.  It's packed full of laughs and fun and boasts a great cast that gives it the edge over the slew of romantic comedies recently released.
  Ben (Matthew McConaughey) makes a bet with his boss that he can get a woman to fall in love with him in ten days to land a valuable advertising campaign (don't ask questions, you'll understand when you see the movie).  Andie Anderson (Kate Hudson) is the ""How To..."" columnist as the hot new women's magazine, Composure.  The topic of Andie's next column?  How To Lose a Guy in 10 Days, hence the name of the film.  If Andie writes the article, her boss, Lana, will give her complete freedom on the topics she writes about Apparently Andie wants to write about ""serious"" issues.  That's great, hon, but why are you working at a glossy fashion mag if you want to write articles on global issues?
  Of course, Ben and Andie see each other at a bar and coincidentally choose each other as their ""victims"".  And then you know what happens...
  Kate Hudson is an absolute gem!  She is sweet, funny, and completely adorable.  The audience genuinely likes Kate Hudson, and thus sympathizes with Andie.  A big problem with most romantic comedies is that the characters are so dislikable that you don't really care what happens to them.  Kate Hudson was able to prevent that.
  McConaughey was fine, but I firmly believe that he doesn't really act in films, just plays himself (he plays the same kind of guy in almost all his movies).
  Ever noticed how most romantic comedies are really quite funny until they reach that inevitable stage when the two stop hating each other (or whatever was holding them from love) and fall in love?  Take McConaughey's ""The Wedding Planner"" (another film in which McConaughey plays himself), which I thoroughly enjoyed until they fell in love.  ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" blessedly does not fall under this category.  The film is consistently funny through and through and never gets boring.",1047254400,14,2027,4.661016949152542

Since the advertisment for this film (and I use that word loosley) had been so frequent on television, those jokes were no longer funny. Boring, predictable and stupid. My wife and her mother and sister found it funny so I would say that maybe JUST MAYBE it is a girl thing and I just don;t understand. Still, I found this to be the worst movie I have seen in a long time.",1046736000,6,543,4.08411214953271

I liked the baby talk by Kate Hudson and the sweet charm by Matthew McConaughey really makes this movie the best. I can't wait to see it again it was so awesome. Andie (Kate Hudson) has to date a guy and lose him in 10 days to get to write whatever she wants. Ben (Matthew McConaughey) has to lose a girl in ten days to get a big break in his carrer. The perfect match. The end is a little predictable but it was still awesome. It is a good chick flick. My favorite part was when Andie made Ben go to a Celin Deon concert and when ben got knocked out. And I think the moral of this movie is it made me think that if your job is that inportant to hurt someome's fellings to not do that specific thing or just quit.(because your boss will make you write that article and u don't want to hurt that person's feelings.) Because you might like him and he might like you. It made you want to see it again and again, can't what 'till it gets out on DVD!!!!

The principal actors are, of course, Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey, supported by Bebe Neuwirth (Lilith from Cheers), Adam Goldberg and others.  The premise is that both of them are working in opposite directions at first, with her being tasked to write a column as the ""how-to"" girl for a Cosmopolitan-like magazine on how to do everything wrong in a relationship and drive guys away.
He, on the other hand, is an advertising exec hoping to get past his genre of beer and women to move on to more glamorous, upscale markets like diamonds.  His scheming co-workers, who by chance learn of Hudson's assignment, make a bet that he can't get a girl to fall in love with him in 10 days, or they will get the diamond account.
What follows is waht you'd expect, initially charming with each other, before the psycho crazy stuff begins.  It is funny to watch, and as a guy, at times painful to see what she puts him through.  But of course, he can't let her drive him away, or he loses the account.  And yet he realizes, and she does, that neither of them wants to really see the other one leave.
At times I was reminded of the Kevin Bacon-Elizabeth Perkins movie He Said, She Said, but as a date movie, this is definitely appealing and well worth the time.",1045872000,,1376,4.488

1852278,3,B00008KDGZ,"Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey star in the romantic comedy ""How to lose a guy in 10 days"". Andie (Hudson) is a writer for a fast growing woman's magazine writing a how to column. In order for her to move up the later she needs to write about exactly what her boss wants her to write about, shoes, relationships, etc instead of politics and religion that Andie is really interested in writing. They come up with a column about how to lose a guy in 10 days a guide on everything wrong to do to a guy to lose him.
Ben (McConaughey) is an successful advertising executive that is looking to make that next big pitch. He happens to make a bet that if he can make a girl fall in love with him in ten days then he can pitch the new client on his ad vision.
Of course this is the set up for the two of them meeting and starting the next 10 days in motion. The movie is filled with the usual chick flick tricks. Guy finds girl, guy loses girl, guy realizes he made a mistake and chases girl who is now leaving.
The movie is a cross between Mel Gibson's ""What Women Want"" and Sarah Jessica Parker's ""Sex in the City"" only with some bad acting and predictable situations. But on a bright spot the movie is very funny with Hudson's antics in making McConaughey leave and makes the movie very manageable to watch.
Hudson's role in this film is very sexy and she does it with no problem. Of course being the daughter of Goldie Hawn she doesn't need to try very hard it must be genetics. She has the sweet innocence that her mother has.
I liked the movie overall, the acting could of been better and the story made to be a little less predictable so I gave the movie a 3 out of 5. But for a chick flick this was actually well done and is the better of the chick flicks I have been dragged to in the past.",1045353600,4,1794,4.128571428571429

1852280,5,B00008KDGZ,"This sweet romantic comedy is predictable, but since when is that a flaw in a romantic comedy?  Kate Hudson is hilarious as she (in the name of journalism) chronicles ""How to Lose A Guy in 10 Days"" by deliberately making all the mistakes of dating.  McConaughey, who we hadn't seen for a while, is the gorgeous ""Guy,"" who for reasons unbeknownst to Kate, is determined to keep her around for longer than the titular 10 days.

The details of the set-up aren't important.  What differentiates this movie is Hudson's comic genius as she does the most ridiculous things in an attempt to drive him away, and the chemistry she has with her straight man, McConaughey.  The movie doesn't overplay the slapstick either: there are some tender and well-acted moments, including a scene when McConaughey and Hudson go out to meet his parents.

Without giving anything away, the film's plot and subplot also sends a positive message that in the end, there are no rules and the best thing to be is yourself.  This film is a refreshing change from the dull Cinderella stories that have been the mainstay of most romantic comedies these days.",1045094400,,1126,4.77319587628866
1852281,4,B00008KDGZ,"Donald Petrie, the director of ""How To Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" knows his way around what I call the New Romantic Comedy, as he also directed Sandra Bullock last year in the irresistible ""Miss Congeniality.""
In ""How To"" he directs, the destined to take over the mantle of Clark Gable, Matthew McConaughey and the luminous Kate Hudson who play two professional people who try everything possible NOT to fall in love. The machinations of the plot take a back seat, though to the very real and palpable romantic combustion that his stars ignite on screen. And like their recent predecessors, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan or Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant for example, Hudson and McConaughey are a believable and natural couple: we can actually picture them in bed together. Which, if this type of film is going to work is absolutely necessary, as real chemistry between stars is a very rare thing. McConaughey didn't have it with Jennifer Lopez in ""The Wedding Planner"" but Ralph Fiennes (!) did in ""Maid in Manhattan."" Go figure.
In a comedy, it is the supporting actors and the characters they play who add texture and substance to the proceedings. Think Rosie O'Donnell in ""Sleepless in Seattle"" or Rhys Ifans in ""Notting Hill."" These characters, besides stealing most scenes that they are in, also give the film a context in which the main characters live. Unfortunately, only a couple of the supporting players in ""How To"" really pop. And this hurts this film.
""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" proves once again that they can ""make movies like they used to"" as long as they populate them with stars as winning and talented as Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey.",1045008000,,1653,4.72318339100346
1852282,5,B00008KDGZ,"What a nice surprise this film is! It is a situational romantic comedy, and so a bit predictable (though I should add that unpredictibility in a formula picture like this is NOT a desirable quality), but the situation works, and the two leads enjoy a great chemistry together.
The situation is far-fetched but clever. A woman intending to write an article entitled ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" meets a guy who has just bet that he can make any woman fall in love with him before a party in 10 days. Thus yoked improbably to one another, the guy who is forced to stay with the woman puts up with behavior that the woman is certain must drive him away, but doesn't. The trick in such a plot is to find a way for the two to fall in love despite her appalling behavior, and the movie does this deftly. There are a couple of false notes along the way, such as a dreadful rendition in front of a room of people of ""You're So Vain,"" but so many moments are so right that I had no trouble forgiving them the few missteps.
I have never disliked Matthew McConaughey, but neither have I been a big fan. He was, however, far more enjoyable in this one than in any other I have seen him in. But the star of the film is without any question Kate Hudson. She is one of those rare screen personalities you can't take your eyes off the entire time she is onscreen. I love her mother as well, but she has none of her mother's cartoonish wackiness, though much of her charm and energy. I predict that she could be the next great comic actress, and should reach the kind of stature that other great comediennes like Meg Ryan, Julia Roberts, and Sandra Bullock have in recent years.
The one baffling element was why much of the movie centered around the NBA playoffs with the New York Knicks, who don't look like they will be a playoff team for the foreseeable future, playing a seven game NBA finals against the Sacramento Kings. Both of those scenarios strain the imagination. Why not instead feature the Yankees, who almost certainly will be in another World Series? Any serious basketball fan will find this part of the movie hard to take.
