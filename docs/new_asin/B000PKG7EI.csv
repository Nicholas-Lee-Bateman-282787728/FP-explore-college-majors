2824181,5,B000PKG7EI,"I don't think I could ever give Scooby-Doo less than 5 stars.  My 4-year-old son, as well as my husband and myself, love Scooby-Doo.  It's one of those cartoons that even adults can enjoy.  I never remember the Pup versions, so am enjoying getting these DVDs to watch.  The Pup versions are just as good as the original Scooby-Doos.  This one has 5 episodes on it.  The picture quality isn't that great because it is the same quality as when it came out - it has not been enhanced.  Doesn't matter if you like Scooby-Doo.",1340150400,,521,4.421052631578948
