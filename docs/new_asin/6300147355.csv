215720,4,6300147355,"Another great early Nichols. He was on one mean ... streak I tell ya. Virgina Wolf, the The Graduate, Catch 22, and then this film. Which is: Very well done, Very mature, extremely confident in it's telling, thought provoking, well acted, well written, etc.
Jack Nicholson and Art Garfunkle star as best buds in this story that follows their sexual encounters from college to middle age. That's really it. No other action takes place in this movie that doesn't have something to do with, yup, Carnal Knowledge. Good title too. Don't you think? Just grabs you.
Like Catch 22, which I just saw, this movie is all about great framing and long one takes. Even though this movie takes place almost completely inside and is very much like a play, it is very cinematic. Nichols always has the camera in the right place, or at least an interesting place. The structure of the film is also so interesting. It just pops around from sexaul encounter to sexual encounter. And it addresses the whole spectrum...: first love, to marriage, to adultery, to apathy, to..well, it covers a lot. And though it tends to focus mainly on the negative, which can be a little bleak, it sure is real.
At times it can be a little slow and a little tedious (you sort of feel Nichols getting a little TOO into some of these long takes), but this remains a very good, intelligent, unflinching movie. Check it out.

215721,4,6300147355,"This movie was one of the first movies to really push the envelope when it came to sex and relationships.  The movie explored the relationship between two college buddies as they started out their single lives just trying to get laid.  As time went on, one of them decided to get married and experience the ""typical"" life(Art Garfunkel), while the other one went about just trying to get laid(Jack Nicholson).  The idea of ""looks are everything"" was portraied by Jack Nicholson, who just wanted a girl that was well-endowed.  Art Garfunkel on the other hand was more sensitive to what a woman wanted, but still did not fully understand what love is.  Both characters had very different ideas on what they wanted in a woman, but both were unable to appreciate what they had, and often went looking elsewhere.  One of the most important lines in the movie comes in the opening credits where the two debate if it is better to love and not be loved back, or to be loved and not love them.  This is the theme the director uses to define the movie.  Nicholson is loved, but has no love to give.  Garfunkel loves, but is not loved back.  It is interesting to watch their lives play out as they grow older, but seems to be missing something that would make it a classic.  I think this could be helped with a better ending, more closure to their lives.

215722,3,6300147355,"Because I admire both Nichols and Feiffer, I wanted to like this film.  And there are many things I did like--it's witty dialogue, authentic performances and progressive, adult treatment of sexuality.  It's fatal flaw is that the characters aren't well-developed; no person in this film demonstrates any notable emotional trajectory.  Ultimately, the creepy awareness sets in that you've been held hostage to an intellectual exercise, built on cliches.  Feiffer wrote a stage play based on an obvious premise, and Nichols rendered it cinematic with heavy-handed framing devices.  I guess the continued viability of the film hinges on how long people are titillated by the word, ""carnal.""",985046400,6,687,5.443396226415095
215723,5,6300147355,"This film shows us how certain people handle relationships and once sex is added in. Nicholson is the sly smooth talking guy who Garfunkel thinks is his buddy, but doesn't realize he is being used to set up Nicholson with  his newly found crush Candy Bergen. They remain friends and we are shown  how their lives go on and how they fall into certain traps due to  weaknesses in their character. A very realistic look at life's  relationships in the modern world that may appear a little tame by today's  standards, But the driving forces remain the same. The acting is superb,  the settings are fine, and the story is gripping and ageless.",963878400,4,639,4.610619469026549
215724,5,6300147355,The kind of quality film making rareley seen these days. The cinematography is superb and directing is masterfull. Even after all these years these characters remain true to their roles. I did not thing of  Murphy Brown or Bridge Over Troubled Water. A beautifully made film not to  be confused with that  awfull '90's ripoff 'Singles'. Jules Feifer's  screenplay is one of the best and Ann-margret's performance of Robby is  proof of Nichols genious. A film worthy to be part of the '70's golden age.  The director truly emerged.,947635200,,530,4.898876404494382
215725,5,6300147355,"...as they were here to their more contemporary selves. Nicholson's portrayal of the misogynistic half of a college roommate duo reveals even here a developing gift for playing cynics. The term his character uses  here--""ballbusters""--what he sees as women's power to use a man's  own libido as a weapon against him--is in spirit a lot like his  court-martialled military officer's sneer in ""A Few Good Men"":  ""You can't HANDLE the truth!"". In contrast, the role Candice  Bergen plays here--a cutesy coed who in one scene gets goofy drunk and  giggles her way through that old Sunday school joke about the hymn about a  bear with crossed eyes--doesn't even seem like the same woman who would  later become a lot more famous as the world-weary know-it-all Murphy Brown.  Art ""Simon and"" Garfunkel isn't much of an actor, but he doesn't  really have to be as Nicholson's nice-guy roomie (which casts him as sort  of a double-foil to BOTH of his more talented costars).",944092800,8,966,4.901234567901234
215726,5,6300147355,"This film, you can say, was probably ahead of its time, since that's the way society has turned out to be.  Let's just go for the sex in a  relationship, and that will be great.  We all know its not.  This is what  we see in Carnal Knowledge.  Jack Nicholson and Art Garfunkel are roommates  in college, and are trying to experience the rite of passage : sex for the  first time.  Garfunkel goes for Candice Bergen, who he never scores with.  Throughout the whole time, though, Nicholson sneakly does with Bergen.  He  really is a ba----- to do that to a friend.  Bergen appears as a good woman  at the beginning, but she really isn't is she after sneakly going with  Nicholson while being with Garfunkel.  But the story gets even more  powerful when they are out of college and Nicholson finds Ann-Margret,  ""Bobby"".  He goes for her, because of her body, and they're in  bed the first night they meet.  That's trouble right there, since that's  how many live in today's society, having one-night stands.  Nicholson and  Margret live with each other, and eventually get married.  Later, we here  Nicholson say when he's showing a slide of Margret, ""That's Bobby, who  conned me into marrying her.""  He later went to say he now pays here  alamony.  He should have thought about that before a one-night stand.  Art  Garfunkel marries Bergen, and by the end of the fim when there older, we  see a third partner he has who is young, played by Carol Kane.  Throughout  the film, when director Mike Nichols is switching through different times  in the men's lives, we see a ballerina type figure turning around on the  ice.  It represents what Nicholson and Garfunkel were doing the whole time  we got to know them, playing on ""ice"", with woman they met.  All  the performances are superb, and particularly, you'll never forget  Nicholson, and even Ann-Margret who sounds like a whore with a heart of  gold, but really isn't.  A masterpiece of a film.",936921600,11,1946,4.6301775147929

In my six plus decades on this earth, I have seen many films, some great, many good, and more than a few not worthy of my time.  This unfortunately falls into the latter category.  Jack Nicholson, one of the great actors of my generation along with the dazzlingly beautiful and talented Ann Margret turned in performances that at best were adequate, but Mike Nichols really dropped the ball on this film.  It's not even a decent coming-of-age film.  It's just boring, plain and simple.  Yes, for those of a voyeuristic bent, you can catch early Ann in the buff, but there should be more to a film than this and that's about all that this production offers.  Now I know why I didn't catch this when it was first released, and I wish that I had not invested the time to watch it at this stage of my life.

It comes across like a stage play for film -- limited settings, small cast, an intense focus on the slow development over decades of two fairly shallow and typical men, both of them intelligent and educated, who have limited capacity for self-reflection and limited capacity for intimacy. Neither of the main characters come off well from a moral or spiritual perspective, although the Jack Nicholson character is clearly the worse-off, and he creates more damage. The acting by Nicholson and Garfunkel is affecting and honest. I wonder why Garfunkel didn't pursue more acting opportunities. Candice Bergen is very good as the virginal love-interest, and for the time this was a notably complex female character.

Art Garfunkel plays Sandy, the more shy and reserved of the two, while Jack Nicholson takes on the role of Jonathan, who begins his college years as a sort of lady's man in training.  Their social lives as college students consist of an interesting dynamic, with the two sharing thoughts regarding their romantic dreams, strategies, and conquests.  Jonathan, with his flat-out ambition to get laid at all costs, naturally scores well in advance of Sandy.  On the other hand, Sandy is the first to discover that women are often able to tell you thoughts that you never knew you hada curious milestone that maddeningly eludes Jonathans grasp.

As the years go on, Sandy leads a conventional life married to his college sweetheart (Candace Bergen), who he later divorces.  Jonathan, however, seems unable to visualize a life beyond a series of conquestswhile growing increasingly intimidated  (to the point of impotence) by the sexual demands of a new generation of empowered women.  Even Jonathans discovery of a woman endowed with what he considers the ideal physical proportions (as embodied by actress Anne Margaret), ultimately leaves him frustrated and isolated.

I am left wondering how Jonathans life would play out if this story were reimagined in todays world with the presence of Viagra and other ED drugs!  My guess is that he would still be frustratedwhile yearning for the invention of a Viagra of the Soul.",1426291200,2,1544,5.047244094488189

There was the frigid virgin who slept with the cad, but wouldn't sleep with her boyfriend, whom she later married and had child by.  There was the eager sex kitten who turned seriously, suicidial despondent, yet she married the smiling cad, later to separate for reasons never mentioned.  There was the beautiful, totally self-centered, bowl-breaker.  And the totally silent 18 year old woman-child who could crack ice with her eyes.

The two male characters changed hardly at all, each completely unaware of who and what they were.  The Garfunkle character floated through life never seeming to go anyware, and the Nicholson character was always chasing another skirt, until at age 40 he was nearly impotent.

The movie was made as the tide was beginning to turn away from the ""hippie Free Love"" of the late 60's and more towards the staidness pending in the generation behind.  By the time this movie was released the micro skirt was all but gone, and along with it ""Free Love"", and skinny thin Twiggy type young women.

No character changed during the movie except maybe the Nicholson character moving towards a probable mental melt-down.  The female characters played on the stage for a short time and were never heard from again.  The Garfunkel character stood extremely close physically face-to-face with the Nicholson character at one point, yet neither character ever even came close to a genuine relationship with a woman.

Nothing happened in the movie, no plot movement except for the Nicholson character becoming near to impotent.  In the end, at age 40, he was reduced to showing slides of himself from a pre-teen to a man in his mid twenties, with the various girls/women of those times.  Nothing, not a thing, does he recall about any woman after about age 25.

216338,2,6300147355,"I don't know what to make of this movie. From the standards of 1971, it was moderately racy for a mass-market movie, but still tame compared to ""I am Curious, Yellow"" for example. There is some nudity, and one very casual frontal nude in a locker-room scene. And there are sex acts, but they are under cover, so all you really get is the grunts and the moves.

Jonathan (Jack Nicholson) and Sandy (Art Garfunkel) are room-mates in college circa 1950. Since neither one impresses me as being all that sexy, it's hard to understand how Susan (Candice Bergen) falls in love with both of them. But she does. Jonathan brazenly called her up one day and she went out for a drink with him, even though he was her boyfriend's best friend. Why? Never made clear. But then a lot of things are never made clear in this movie.

Time passes. Sandy marries Susan, they have a proper suburban family. Jonathan is still playing around. It's getting pretty tiresome, he admits, but he's just not into the whole marriage shtick. Fine. Sounds like a very typical man of his time (now into the sixties). Then he meets Bobbie (Ann-Margret) and they have a great time together; lots of laughs, great sex. So after awhile, she suggests they shack up together, he decides it's a good idea as long as they understand it's not marriage, and she agrees. Still later, he suggests she quit her job, and she does.

Beginning to sound like half the couples you've known? Maybe even yourself? Believe me, every cliche from the fifties and sixties is in here. Funny thing is, the Supreme Court had to be the one to decide that it was not obscene: Rehnquist said, ""nudity alone is not enough to make material legally obscene."" He also said the film ""did not depict sexual conduct in a patently offensive way.""

No, but it managed to make it pretty darn boring, which offended me. I will give this two stars. One for being at least mildly entertaining, and one for breaking ground with the Supreme Court.",1337385600,8,1969,4.569405099150142

216370,3,6300147355,"This 1971 film is about the relationships that two male friends have with the women in their lives and covers a period of about 20 years starting in the late 1950s.  It stars Jack Nicholson and Art Garfunkel and begins in their college days.  It seems the only thing they talk about is women and sex and there a touch of humor in their quest for their first intimate experience.

There's a comic quality to their early liaisons they both have with Candice Bergen but they are still very young. Fast forward a few years and Nicholson is now romancing Ann Margaret.  Their relationship is based on their mutual attraction and is doomed from the beginning.  Eventually Ann Margaret stops working and does nothing but sleep.  Garfunkel is having his own problems with his wife.  The two men commiserate but neither of them see how they are sabotaging their own interests by their objectifying the women in their lives.

The film moved slowly and many of the shots were filmed against a stark background in an attempt to be arty.  There were lots of close up shots of sorrowful faces.  The acting was good, of course and I especially liked the role of Rita Moreno who appears only in one dynamic scene which sums up the relations that Jack Nicholson has with his women.

Even though the film was intense and well acted, I just plain didn't like it.  I was a bit bored and annoyed at the characters.  Yes, it was a window into relationships between the sexes and it was well done but it was just too downbeat for my taste.",1309132800,5,1516,4.509157509157509
216371,5,6300147355,"A surprisingly smart film on the subject of romance and sexual desire, and one featuring some of the most honest conversations on the subjects thereof.

Nichol's was right, and though the film was not a commercial success, it lives this day as a film one may view alone, or with several members from the Metropolitan Opera's production of Verdi's ""La Gazza Ladra.""

Lost, forgotten, or a victim of disinterest, this film has been unfairly overlooked among the fine works of The Mike Nichols Collection for too long. And fouler the insult, ""Carnal Knowledge"" truly owns some of the finest moments of acting, short in length though they may be, that I have ever seen. These moments are sometimes quiet . . often very intimate. They consisting of frank and earnest discussions of vastly varying volumes concerning what it is that ignites the fire that so well begins a passionate relationship, and what it might be that slowly corrupts and turns this wonderful, maddening passion into cruelty and contempt.

On some less fundamentally important perspectives, Ann Margaret has never looked more beautiful--in fact, the notion of feminine beauty, the rationale for copulation, has never been more explicable, than here, in this film. If you are apt to appreciate the early works of author Milan Kundera, this film will fit you rather well, and if you're a fan of Mike Nichols' earlier work, ""Carnal Knowledge"" might--might--offer some answers as to why a pair the likes of George and Martha of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Who-s-Afraid-of-Virginia-Woolf/dp/B0045HCJ94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf</a>"" ever found one another.

""Carnal Knowledge"" is a smart and sexy film, featuring an ensemble of clever people speaking with other clever people about things that matter. The film first stirs your attention, and then draw you in. With remarkable performances by Jack Nicholson, Art Garfunkel and Candice Bergen; and one transcendent performance by Ann-Margret, you come to care for these characters; you wish, for reasons various and, on occasion, unmentionable, to be part of the sensational and stirring action. This film is unlike any American films being made today; and that fact, together with its inherent greatness, makes this film so very precious, and such a joy to watch.

Nicholson was in his 30s when he made this, and his attempt to portray a predatory college student in the 50s is fairly credible. Art Garfunckel was the major surprise here. His acting was extraordinarily well done for someone known primarily as a singer. Ann Margaret was at a peak here, too, as was Candace Bergen, two of the better actresses of their day. I found Nicholson funny, as usual. He was already onto his schtick here that he would go on to develop in many more movies.

Can you see yourself?

The film revolves around two friends, Sandy and Jonathan, as they filter through relationship after relationship in order to find satisfaction with the fairer gender.  From college through to adulthood, these two men approach their relationships with the same tenacity yet a different emotional makeup leaves them with drastically different outcomes.  Sandy is the softer of the two, the one who is easily manipulated by Jonathan's views and ideals, but his tenderness sets him apart, despite his desire to be more like Jonathan.  Jonathan is really the heart of the film, for he epitomizes all that is wrong with the self-destructive pattern set out by many young men today.  His desire to attain everything `fleshly' leaves him empty and unable to truly connect and love another person, let alone himself.

As I have decided to dedicate the better part of today to Jack Nicholson, I'm going to focus on him here, since his performance really carries this film for me.  I adore Ann-Margret here (rightfully so), but this is Nicholson's movie.  This is a perfect example of Nicholson building on the persona he created for himself early in his career, but this is one of the best uses of that persona.  While I love his work in `One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' or `The Last Detail', for me this is a much richer and deeper performance.  He paints Jonathan with such blunt strokes that it would be easy to form a disgust for him, yet he layers those strokes with undeniable inner struggle, showcasing the emptiness that his character is trying so desperately to fill.  His lack of understanding in the subject of relationships (both intimate and platonic) aids in his downfall.  He doesn't know what it means to be a friend.

I know someone just like him; sadly.

The rest of the cast is stellar, but they do take a backseat to Nicholson for me.  Ann-Margret is astonishing as Jonathon's jilted lover Bobbie.  Her ability to convey that loss that comes from loving a man who cannot love you the right way is heartbreaking.  Art Garfunkel is surprisingly strong here.  I really loved the way his performance contrasted Nicholson's in almost every manner.  He understood how to play that coy and nave best friend role flawlessly.  I also really liked was Candice Bergen did here.  Her portrayal of Susan was sensitive, earthy and believable.

As many have noted (critics and fans alike), this is one of those films that begs to be discussed and dissected.  It is the definition of controversial, but that is welcome in this case for Mike Nichols understands what he is doing here.  He has a respect for the film subject and so it never comes across as sloppy or, worse yet, trashy.  This is sincere and earnest and HONEST and that makes it one of the better films to broach the darker side of displays of love (or affection).",1263513600,2,3255,4.755793226381462

This movie was considered very risqu&eacute; in 1971, and still retains some shock value from the coarse and passionless way the two men talk about and experience the opposite sex.  Though Nicholson was in his thirties, he still pulls off being a giggling college freshman.  As his character ages, he becomes the bitter and worldly-wise man he's played so often and so well.  Garfunkle (then a wildly successful folk singer) was a good choice as the bumbling young man who needs his roommate's prodding to go all the way with his girl (a lovely, young Candice Bergen).

I didn't like the movie much because of its unresolved episodic scenes and the callous approach to what women would call ""romance.""

216406,5,6300147355,"Carnal Knowledge, when released in 1971, was very controversial and was one of the first films to be about sex. There had been movies before it with sexual content, but not a movie that was about sex and what we do for it.

Although looking at it now, this film can't hold a candle to other sexual films around nowadays and it's a bit dated with the times but it's still a ground-breaking piece of filmmaking and it's a really good movie. It's not for everyone though, not just because of the subject matter, but because it's about people and conversations. The film isn't dialogue, event, dialogue, event, dialogue, big event. The film is instead; setting, dialogue, setting, dialogue, nudity, dialogue...It plays almost like a play, rather than a movie but it somehow works. Jack Nicholson and Art Garfunkel play two college roommates named Jonathan and Sandy. When we meet the two men, they're both virgins and talk graphicly about what they desire in a woman. About the same time, at a party, Sandy meets a woman named Susan (Candice Bergen) and falls for her. But, Jonathan begins dating her simultaneously (hiding it from Sandy) and ends up losing his virginity to Susan before Sandy does. Jonanthan, out of guilt, hastily breaks up with Susan and Sandy stays with her. Jonathan never tells Sandy what happened. Instead, the story moves on with Jonathan falling for a woman named Bobbie (Ann-Margret, who was really hot). Sandy doesn't disappear, but his character is downgraded from here. The movie is 98 minutes and Sandy is probably in it a little over 30 minutes. Anyway, that's all I can really say about the plot without telling you everything. All the actors are spectacular, but as usual it's Nicholson who gives the best performance. There are scenes in the film where the camera will hold on an actor for a long period of time and have the actor recite a long monologue. Everytime this happens with Nicholson, he knocks it out of the park. Anyway, this is an innovative and highly interesting film; As I said, it's not for everybody...But it's definitely worth checking out.

216439,5,6300147355,"One of the most controversial movies ever made, this early 1970s' masterpiece cemented the reputations of Jack Nicholson and Mike Nichols, proved that Art Garfunkel can act, gave Candice Bergen her big break, and turned Ann-Margret into a serious actress. Initially, ""Carnal Knowledge"" was greeted with mixed reactions, but over time has been considered groundbreaking in its frank portrayal of sexual relationships between two womanizing friends over a nearly 30 year period.

The film starts off in college, where two friends name Jonathan (Nicholson) and Sandy (Garfunkel) are roommates who dote on sex and nothing else. When Sandy meets Susan (Bergen) at mixer, he is immediately smitten with her, as is Jonathan, who takes her under his own wing. A few years go by as we see Sandy become involved with Jennifer (Carol Kane). Finally, Jonathan falls in love with the beautiful, and, yes, busty Bobbie (Ann-Margret, who deservedly got an Oscar nomination for her role). Their relationship becomes rougher as years go by, culminating in one of Nicholson's greatest fits of rage ever, matched by Ann's emotional breakdown as she begs him to marry her. The film seems to be very crowded, but the plot unfolds so smoothly, you never get a sense of ""gosh, I wanna shut this off because I don't understand it"", since every storyline in it grabs you and never lets go.

The performances in this film are perfect. Nicholson gives one of his best performances ever as Jonathan, while Ann-Margret gives what may well be her single greatest performance of her career. It was great to see these two perform together, as Nicholson is my favorite actor and Ann my favorite actress. The two play off each other so well that they make the film watchable for their chemistry alone. Garfunkel was a perfect choice to play Sandy. Everyone may know him as one half of Simon & Garfunkel, but watching him play the part, he embodies it so well you can't imagine anyone playing the role. Though she leaves the movie pretty early, Candice Bergen did a superb portrayal of Susan, and Carol Kane was great as Jennifer. Rita Moreno does not appear until the last scene, but she really does the make the most of her screen time.

Absolutely convincing as the boyish, naive, gullible beta-male being sexually mentored by the wannabe alpha-male played by Jack Nicholson who by movie's end has hardened into massive psychological and sexual dysfunction.  Candice Bergen and Ann Margaret are both spectacular, the brief nude scenes with A.M. were quite refreshing in showing how yummy a pre-aerobics, pre-silicone female body can be and of course this woman just oozes animal sexuality.

One of the beauties of this movie is its journalistic (rather than MORALISTIC) approach...it shows things as they are, instead of shoving its own ""spin"" onto some potentially volatile subject matter.

Strong and original characters played by capable actors, an authentic and uncompromising storyline...Hollywood just doesn't make them like this anymore!

216442,4,6300147355,"This movie struck a chord with me, having dealt with some very similar people during my lifetime.  Events depicted in the film aren't as relevant as the personalities behind the events.  Nicholson's character is most certainly a sociopath--shallow, manipulative, vain, and unable express genuine emotions or empathize with the pain he inflicts upon others.  He desires the 'perfect' woman, a (preferably) buxom woman who can give him great sex and then turn into a little china doll to be placed on a shelf until she's needed again.  It's that simple.  He eventually finds 'happiness' in the form of Rita Moreno--a woman who is willing to act out Nicholson's fantasies with him, right down to speaking a very precisely planned dialogue.

Ann-Margret's character is a tragic figure.  Having been used all of her life as a sex toy, she ""shacks up"" with Nicholson in the hope of finding true love.  But her personality isn't nearly strong enough to reform him.  She fears being alone and unloved above all else and is willing to repeatedly swallow her pride while taking abuse in the hope that everything will somehow turn out all right.  She is a classic example of a kept woman who ends up losing her soul.  She is willing to share everything with men who will never share anything of themselves with her.

Candice Bergen, despite her second billing, has a relatively small role as an innocent woman (unlike Ann-Margret) who succumbs to Nicholson's charms despite being involved with his 'best friend.'  She is an example of women who go for the bad guy, the rebel, the wolf, in their youth before settling down with a good guy as they mature.

Garfunkel's character is something of a paradox.  He's a nice guy who envies Nicholson's bad boy ways and conquests.  As a result, he, too, finds himself straying in an attempt to find his niche.

Rounding out the major players is Cynthia O'Neal, in the role of Garfunkel's one-time girfriend Cindy.  She is as strong as Nicholson, something that intrigues and attracts him greatly.  Still, in the end, he must know that it would be the equivalent of mixing fire and gasoline.  But that doesn't stop him from trying to play with fire.

Jack has his own work life and want Ms Margaret to have a life of her own instead of lazing around in bed.  Rita Moreno's character has some interest as she enjoys calling the shots in an affair with Garfunkel.

Mostly interesting is the way the friendship between Nicoloson and Garfunkel evolves over the course of their lifetimes from college to mid career.  They somehow are able to confide in each other although Nicolson's character seems to feel he can stand on his own two feet more adeptly.

The early scenes between him and Garfunkel are fresh and sincere. Spanning some three decades of their friendship, we see how their attitudes towards sex, and women in general, shape their lives. Both actors do a fine job of communicating the gravity of those years, and the most devastating scene is the one where Jack delivers a long and furious tirade at Ann-Margret. ""I don't want a job, I want you,"" she says, to which he replies, ""I'm taken...by me!"" Brutally honest, yes, but because we've seen what comes before, it's perfectly logical. These men are still affected by the innocence of their younger years, but that innocence is violently clashing with their adult understanding (or lack thereof)--the understanding that the personality is in perpetual motion, and that it becomes difficult to keep up. The movie is often bleak in its settings and its subject matter, but the characters are very real--they challenge you to challenge them. Their dysfunctions may enlighten you, and there is nothing bleak about being enlightened.

Jack Nicholson portrays your typical chauvinistic male who thinks scoring sexually is the ultimate goal in relationships. He typifies the old male guard before the sexual and human rights revolution of the 1960s and onward. Love was secondary compared with the male conquering the female.

Nicholson plays the role so realistically that it is frighteningly graphic: the cruelty of his actions towards  Candace Bergen and Ann Margaret, not to mention his best friend Art Garfunkle. Having grown up at the end of the chauvinistic period, I saw this type of behavior between the sexes everyday.

Art Garfunkle, Ann Margaret, Candace Bergen excellently play roles that are graphically realistic. Art has a wonderfully naive nature that is easily exploited by his friend, and his nature sets himself up for disappointments in love.

Candace Bergen plays a nice women who willingly falls prey to Nicholson's aggressive, but charming chauvinism.

Ann Margaret plays the ultimate man's sex dream, but is very interesting because she wants to break out of the stereotyped role and become a normal wife.

Nicholson is the most interesting character because he has the most tragic outlook on sex and relationships, and at the end, he is reduced to an impotent and pathetic excuse for a human being.

Great film. Every adult should watch this film, especially before they consider a relationship with the other sex.

But at the time, this was some serious in depth conversation about the inner workings of the male-female relationship.",1521244800,,276,4.8936170212765955

7804044,4,6300147355,"Certainly a really terrific film, yet a shocking-to-the-core and revealing commentary on mysogeny and the challenges of male-female heterosexual romantic relationship. Was quite curoius to see Nicholson gazing at Garfunkels eyes and lips in certain of their scenes; certain moments had a definite bromance or homoerotic vibe. Truly a film worth watching. Ann-Margret shines. A couple of plot points were missed. Sandy never confronts Susan and his best-friend (who never leaves his fantasy world to come down to earth where the rest of us mortals live and have relationships). Still, great cinema that largely stands the test of time.",1495238400,,634,5.414141414141414
