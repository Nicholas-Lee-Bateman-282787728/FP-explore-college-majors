4519399,4,B00514JKDS,"aside from the many ""3-d' shots, which had items coming at the viewer, it was a good western of the early fifties, with a very sympathetic, well rounded story of the ""native americans"" dealing with the white culture taking over their land. rock hudson was a good choice of an actor, and he did a good job, as an emerging stuio supported 'star'.  this was when actors like jimmy stewart were taking control of their careers, but hudson was under contracted, educated as afilm actor, and protected from any hint of scandal.  it wasa time when westerns were a big draw and the story line was typical , and the production values with on location, and cinematography well woth the price of admission.",1312761600,7,695,4.642276422764228
4519400,4,B00514JKDS,"This movie had gotten some poor reviews and Hudson himself wasn't happy with his performance in it, so I had hesitated to order it. But I had enjoyed Jeff Chandler as Cochise in ""Broken Arrow"" (Chandler appears in a cameo appearance in Cochise's death scene at the start of the film), and as a Hudson fan I wanted to see if ""Taza"" was as bad as it was made out to be.  I was pleasantly surprised. It held my attention -- and I've seen a lot worse movies!  The story wasn't the hackneyed white man good/red man bad, and I found Hudson believable in the role.  I think Hudson fans will be satisfied with this movie, even if Hudson himself wasn't.",1311379200,11,644,4.305785123966942
8452258,5,B00514JKDS,I LOVE this movie. Because it was NOT the typical 50'S western movie about Indians and it tried to present a more POSITIVE view of native americans which I liked.  Plus I also thought Rock Hudson was much better in this movie than HE gave HIMSELF credit for at the time. I mean this was ONLY  his second movie with Douglas Sirk at the time. And they would end up making 9 movies together before 1959. I also think Douglas Sirk was the BEST director for Rock Hudson as an actor.,1472515200,,477,4.230769230769231

I didn't know that Rock Hudson starred in

I love the old westerns.

8452266,4,B00514JKDS,"Having recently watched several superlative Douglas Sirk-directed films (Magnificent Obsession, All That Heaven Allows, Imitation of Life), I was curious to see what he would do with a low-budget B venture. So I was delighted to find Taza available in its original 3D (not this 'flat' version). Though rather lightweight, the story does manage to incorporate some of Sirk's familiar themes: action based on personal principle, independence of thought, strength of character, etc. What's outstanding - and typical of Sirk's other films - is the tight direction and superb cinematography. Every scene is carefully composed, and here the composition includes depth. There are the usual objects flying through the screen, but most of the effects are carefully chosen for dramatic impact and serve to heighten the viewer's involvement in the action (and there's lots of it). Not a great film, but very interesting to watch and think about within the context of this director's more important work.",1321833600,,992,5.32484076433121
8452267,2,B00514JKDS,I remember when this video was on TV. Its fun to watch Blue Eyed White People trying to look like Native Americans.  What a bunch of Clowns.  This mostly just a bunch junk.  Anyhow have fun.,1318982400,,190,4.222222222222222
