762363,4,6303946860,"I seriously doubt Mr. Denzel Washington is able to give anything less than a performance of total conviction, as he proves once again to me here in one of his earliest leading roles. In a true-life portrayal of George  McKenna, new principal to the trouble-torn George Washington Memorial High  School, he is wholly convincing. The problems he encounters are not solely  those caused by the students, but also the parents and indeed some of the  teachers. His determination to turn things round stems from his passion  that his pupils WILL graduate to college if they want to, and that this  will never happen if they don't feel anyone cares about them. Despite  resistance from some pupils and teachers,(not to mention ongoing gang  warfare within the grounds), others rise to the occasion, both for  themselves and for McKenna himself, such is the respect he gains. In the  process of such diligence his once supportive girlfriend leaves him under  the pressure of his split commitments, but as for the School, he succeeds.  Seeing the graduating students really is a heartwarming moment! Having  previously seen ""187"", it does make the violent scenes and  troublesome pupils here look bland by comparison, but its hard to tell if  this film was sanitised or ""187"" sensationalised. Regardless, its  still well worth the watch, especially if you respect Denzel's work in  later movies already.",936748800,41,1394,5.070484581497797
762444,5,6303946860,This book reflected a story I experienced hands on. I attended Washington Prep and had the opportunity to be a student under Principle George McKenna between 1984 and 1986. He demonstrated that one person can make a difference when they are willing to show true compassion to others.,1412553600,,283,4.916666666666667

762449,5,6303946860,"I loved this movie; not only because that fine Denzel Washington played Mr. McKenna, but because it was very personal to me.  George McKenna was one of my instructors at Jordan High School in Watts.  Denzel portrayed Mr. McKenna to the T!!!!  After 45+ years, I am still in touch with Mr. McKenna, my not so secret  crush!!!!!!",1399161600,,327,4.586206896551724

762452,5,6303946860,"All teachers, community leaders and parents should see this. This was based on a true story about one mans, courage and preservation to mkae something out of those who gave up on themselves, their children and education. It took Denzel with that swagger to make his point come across. For the real George McKenna you should have gotten a Nobel Peace prize for what you did. You proved that it takes a village to take care, protect and raise a child and that without an  education you won't go far. Thank you I was literally moved to tears.",1362700800,,539,4.5

762493,5,6303946860,"AS ANOTHER PERSON SAID, WHEN YOU SEE DENZEL WASHINGTON AS AN ACTOR IN A MOVIE, YOU KNOW THE MOVIE WILL BE GREAT
THIS IS NO EXCEPTION TO THE RULE",1297555200,,144,4.0
762494,5,6303946860,"Impressed.  Learning that this movie was based a true story and it originated before Lean on Me will put in the right perspective when watching IT. Denzell did a marvelous job of showing his conviction for this role and portraying change ---- against all odds. It is a true reminder to believe in YOURSELF and it is okay to rely on a few good people to make all of the difference in the world.

IF YOU ARE COLLECTING GOOD WHOLESOME VIDEOS THAT CAN BE PULLED OUT OF YOUR LIBRARY AND SHOWN TO ALL AGES, ESPECIALLY HIGH SCHOOL SOPHOMORES AND UP --- THIS IS A MUST SEE AND PURCHASE.  GET THE FAMILY TOGETHER AND SET TIME ASIDE FOR A DISCUSSION AFTERWARDS, IT JUST MIGHT PRODUCE A CHANGE IN YOUR PERSPECTIVE.

When you get finish watching it, you will actually want MORE --- because it was just that good.",1264032000,,800,4.421768707482993
762495,4,6303946860,"This movie was pretty good.  It was done in the usual Denzel fashion, SMOOTH, SUAVE AND DEBONAIR. My only complaint is that the movie was too short.  It ran about 1 1/2 hour.  That is not enough Denzel.",1210636800,,202,4.2631578947368425
762496,2,6303946860,"A lot of Denzel's early movies fall a little short, but because I am a lifelong fan and am in the process of collecting all of his movies (good or bad), I will have to recommend this movie.  Honestly, it falls short of his later, greater stuff: it's dull, slow.  But a must-have if you are collecting.",1194739200,,301,4.2631578947368425

762498,5,6303946860,"I am one of many family members who in fact attended George Washington High School, now George Washington Preparatory High School. After reading the previous reviews of others, I can make this statement. You have to live an event to really appreciate art imitating life.

  For most movie makers it can be difficult at best to recreate a story such as this about a person who took on odds, doubt & obstacles to give African American & Latino students a better shot at life, through eduaction.

  Personally, I loved this movie. I first saw it during my Sophomore year in high school. I was on hiatus my fall semester attending another school, and was upset that I couldn't be back home. However, I was filled with pride knowing that my principal, & school's history was becoming a part of Americana. So to some this may have been a cheezy attempt. To me this made for TV film will go down in history that preceeded Lean On Me, Stand and Deliver an others, but all will chronical the struggles and triumphs that a few will self inflict to take on the inequalities our nation perpetuates on it's inner city youth.",1147651200,15,1111,4.557788944723618
762499,1,6303946860,"Being a teacher and Denzel Washington fan, I thought I might find some enjoyment and inspiration from a film purporting to illustrate the difficulties and solutions of the inner city high school experience. I experienced neither. Only frustration penetrated my senses as I wasted a couple of hours watching this film (after wasting ten bucks buying it)!

The story line might have worked, though I doubt it, if a few obvious needs had been mandated in the production and direction, like proper casting and a believable script. Worst of these offenses was the casting, as all of the ""high school"" students were at least twenty-five, and most older. Talk about suspension of disbelief! The same cast would have worked were they cast as the parents of the students! At times Denzel looked younger than the student he was mentoring. Indeed, it was preposterous.

I'm sure Mr. Washington looks upon this film as nothing more than a poor experience on the way to excellence, one of those setbacks we learn from to help us find our way.

Don't waste your time or money.",1135382400,12,1062,4.824175824175824
