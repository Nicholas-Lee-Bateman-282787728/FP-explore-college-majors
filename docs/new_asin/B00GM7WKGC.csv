8624541,5,B00GM7WKGC,Power Chi Energetics is really different from all other exercise routines I have done in the past. This really has gotten me in better shape much quicker than any other exercise routine I know of. The beauty of the system is that the exercises and movements can be utilized to benefit any age and skill level; basically you start out with a few reps of each exercise and gradually increase the number of reps and depth of body extension of each movement until you achieve your desired fitness level. Your goal is to complete the desired reps of all the movements within twenty minutes- Can be done anywhere and way better than 2 hours at the gym!,1385424000,,646,4.52991452991453
