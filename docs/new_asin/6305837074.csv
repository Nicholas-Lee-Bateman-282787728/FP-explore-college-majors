Frampton comes alive was the first album I have  ever bought; have to say that it was very impressing (read: emotional) to  see him peforming live. The guy is not only a terrific guitar player; he's  also a 'nice guy'. This is probably one of the best live gigs I have ever  seen and I have seen quite a few. Let's just say: old rockers never die.",958867200,,516,4.181818181818182

1086928,5,6305837074,"As a long time Peter Frampton fan, I waited for this day,when this DVD fell on my doormat. I ran upstairs to check out this DVD on my brand new Yamaha DSP-AX1 Amplifier......I was very curious how this concert would  sound in DTS format.... I could not believe my ears !  I have a lot of  DTS concerts like ""Hell freezes over"" from The Eagles, and Tina  Turner ""Live in Amsterdam"", but this really sets the standard !  I know that Peter Frampton is a sound freak, and loves gatgets, so I wasn't  surprised that this DVD would sound extraordinary. Apart from that, he  still rocks like never before. The boys are jamming away as if their lives  depend on it. Boy oh boy, did I enjoy this DVD. I'm so glad that I can  watch this DVD over and over again, without losing quality, and I will tell  you one thing, I'm going to watch this over, and over and over.",958780800,21,856,4.228395061728395
1086929,4,6305837074,it is refreshing to see somebody that obviously enjoys his job. I really enjoyed the sound quality of this video in the dts format. I found myself leaving this concert video in for the music alone. This video should be  included in most collections,958780800,,248,4.636363636363637
1086930,4,6305837074,bought this dvd the first day out and it rocks. The video tranfer is crystal clear and the 5.1 encoding sounds great on by bose acoustamas 15.... Peter looks at peace with himself and the other members of the band  and I've always said he is one of rocks greatest guitar players and he  proves it here.,958521600,4,302,4.280701754385965
1086931,5,6305837074,"I traveled 1600 miles to see this show, All you have to do is click your mouse. DO IT NOW! Frampton concert videos are scarce. Grab yours while you can! A stellar performance by a ""Live"" legend. He covers 30  years, adds new twists and songs, and throws in some British humor for good  measure.",955411200,5,294,4.327272727272727
1086932,5,6305837074,"I was at this concert the night it was filmed. Frampton and his band were on fire! The sound quality was perfection  and the performance was awesome.  These guys just get better and better! Highlights: Frampton and band rocked with  ""I Don't Need No Doctor"", a great Humble Pie tune,  Frampton also performed one of his beautiful songs that is 27 years old,  from his first solo album, for the first time live ever, played his hits  over the years from Frampton Comes Alive, and went right on into some great  new rockin' tunes.  The energy and performance was amazing. Don't miss this  one!  You'll feel like you were right there in the audience at the concert  when you see this DVD!",954806400,9,685,4.532786885245901
1087064,5,6305837074,"This is an old concert, from 1999 and the video quality is not up to HD or Blu Ray standards, however ...just listen to the music!!
Frampton relates to the audience, plays some old and new ( well then it was new )stuff...and if you listen to it in digital (using the coax or optical outs of your dvd player)....Frampton does truly come alive!",1374019200,,342,4.359375
1087065,5,6305837074,"I haven't seen Peter Frampton do much in many years and this concert brought back great memories of those awesome songs of his. Although older, he has not lost his touch to entertain. Well worth the money and a must have for any classic rock concert enthusiast.",1356652800,,261,4.574468085106383

Hopefully, this will be re-released in the near future.",1315699200,,308,3.967741935483871
1087068,5,6305837074,"I attempted to purchase this DVD over 6 months ago.  Evidently it has become a collectable item that is increasingly difficult to find.  I had to purchase a used copy but found a reputable vendor thru Amazon who guaranteed their merchandise.  It was worth the wait.  The audio in DTS mode is very good and the video is very acceptable.  There is no big stage production, just musicians playing some great stuff.  I saw Frampton during his heyday on the Comes Alive tour.  White amps and a huge white canvas on the stage was pretty cool back then in front of over 20K fans but this performance in Detroit just rocks.

Note that the audio set up is in the Bonus Features.",1305504000,,669,4.426229508196721

I'm sure glad I picked it up not to long after it was released. A ""Must-Have"" for Peter Frampton fans - if you don't already have it - and can afford it!",1301529600,,313,4.508771929824562
1087070,4,6305837074,It's always impressive to see and hear a rocker who can still perform up to standards years after their popularity was at its peak. As with all music I enjoy it is the melody I look for most and Frampton is a master of it. His guitar playing is superb and he is every bit the showman. This concert has good quality sound and video for an outdoor venue and the audience is an appreciative one. Pay attention to his sidemen who give Frampton just enough accompaniment without being intrusive.,1298764800,,490,4.455555555555556
1087071,5,6305837074,"So xmas has passed and you did not get this DVD, buy it for yourself. I just watched it again for the umpteenth time, still a great concert. If you are looking for special effects (aka fog, ice, wind, etc, great photography, haircuts, stylistic editing - then forget this DVD. But if you like truly solid music by a talented musicians who are an ensemble, this is it. Thank you Mr. Frampton.",1292284800,,391,4.444444444444445

1087138,5,6305837074,My wife and I saw the video of the concert on a Satellite TV Channel and had to have a copy.  Peter Frampton has improved with age.  Frampton and his band are great musicians.  Great concert DVD.  You won't be disappointed. Great performance by Bob Mayo.  He will be missed.,1271808000,,274,4.4

1087140,1,6305837074,Who would want a DVD that only shows a still portrait of Peter Frampton.  Actually sold to me as a DVD however should have been listed as a CD.  Not a good explaination given in the description.  I actually had to order it again from some other online company...,1233187200,,262,4.3061224489795915
1087141,5,6305837074,"I bought this for my wife, and was blown away by Peter's performance on this dvd. The band was really on that night very tight. It was great to see the late Bob Mayo with the band. His keyboards and guitar really complimented Peter. The encore was great finishing with I Don't Need No Doctor, from the Humble Pie days. Can't Take That Away, was the best song in my opinion of many. Great quality, I can't say enough. Loved it!",1230249600,,426,4.271604938271605

1087144,5,6305837074,"I have never been what you call a HUGE Frampton fan, but I, as millions of others, loved ""Comes Alive"". I saw this show a couple of years ago on PBS, I think it was, and just bought the DVD. I was floored from the opening song. That is what you call a tight band. WOW!!! Frampton is simply one of the best guitarist alive right now. He just shredded those solos. I was also very impressed with Bob Mayo. Is there anything that guy can't do??? If you like good quality music, good production, bur overall excellent guitar work, then buy this DVD. Fortunately, I got to watch and listen on a 52"" HDTV with 1200W surround sound. Breathtaking!!!!!",1196726400,,643,4.366666666666666

1087146,5,6305837074,"Mr Frampton is simply amazing.  His performance here is spectacular, he has proven himself a Guitar God and has only improved with time and lack of locks.  A great addition to any rock collection.
Only wish Signed, Sealed and Delivered was there too.",1187049600,3,250,4.790697674418604

1087240,5,6305837074,"Wow!! Where do I start with this one? Could this be Frampton Really Comes Alive Part 3? I had this taped for a long time from a showing of it on TV but I had to grab it when it came out on DVD. I'm really not even a huge Frampton fan but this one is just awesome all the way through. Peter's voice is better than it ever has been, the band is super tight, the 5.1 sound is spot on, and the HD cameras swoop from every camera angle. The audience is involved in a lot of shots. He couldn't have picked out a better mix of rock and acoustic songs on this one. Every instrument comes through perfectly with not a hint of burying each other in the mix. Dare I say Peter has the almost perfect guitar tone as this as well?? Even if you are not a Frampton fan, you owe it to yourself to grab this DVD. I have over 100 concert videos and this one would rank in the top 5. Way to go Peter!!",1173744000,3,881,3.8461538461538463
1087241,4,6305837074,Solid quality DVD.  Great picture.  Great sound.  Frampton can still play! Interaction with the crowd is a bit strained and that detracts from the overall enjoyment of the DVD - but the musical work is great!,1173312000,,208,4.722222222222222

La versin de 'Do you feel like we do?' con el 'Talkbox' includo es memorable, como es de esperar de un msico de la talla de Frampton.",1168560000,2,559,4.224299065420561

1087246,4,6305837074,I am a fan of Peter Frampton. I was fortunate to see him in person in Southern MN not too many years ago (2003). I really enjoyed the show. This DVD captures some of what it is like to be there in person. I hope this helps you to decide if you want to own it or not. Sound and picture are of exellent quality on this DVD.

1087247,5,6305837074,"think twice when you hear the word Frampton.  he is a great guitar player..  ive seen him twice as of late, and he puts on a great show, and the dvd displays his best work..  rousing guitar work.. clear outstanding sound..  fantastic job by the producer..  the drums come out loud, hard and pounding without covering over the rest of the band.. the vocals are great,  just a joy to watch or listen to alone..  highly recommended for any guitar fan...  don't miss this one",1166745600,,471,4.458823529411765

1087249,5,6305837074,"Frampton and his band play a terrific set to an excited crowd in Detroit. One middle aged fan is so intense he runs onstage to give PF a hug while the great one is engaged in a slow burn guitar solo. After security chase the guy away, The rattled Frampton shrugs off the lead and passes to the keyboard player, who really gets into it. This band is tightly in synch. The sound is outstanding in 5.1 and the video is well edited to give you the feel of being at the show. I guess I forgot what an awesome lead guitar player Frampton is. The long hair is gone and the spectacles make him look like your teacher, but man does he put on a show. His Les Paul just sings. I think I've watched this ten times all the way through since I got it last month. Excellent throughout.",1165017600,,770,4.105960264900662
1087346,5,6305837074,"I ordered this one after finally having a home system capable of doing it justice.. Thanks to all those who reviewed before me, you were RIGHT!

1087347,4,6305837074,"I agree with most of the other reviewers and I enjoyed this performance by Peter Frampton.  I am a casual fan of Frampton and really enjoyed the CD ""Frampton Comes Alive"" which is the quintessential classic rock live album of the 70's. I've been wanting to see a live performance of these songs by Frampton for some time and I was glad that this DVD was available.  My favorite tracks on this DVD are the well-known hits, ""Show Me the Way,"" ""Baby I Love Your Way"", ""Something's Happening,"" and ""Do You Feel Like We Do?""  An older looking Frampton plays these pieces with great enthusiasm and great skill, and he is backed by a great band.  On ""Do You Feel Like We Do?""  Frampton gets interrupted by a fan who walks across the stage, and he is visibly distraced by that -- the keyboardist then plays his solo piece, Frampton introduces the band, and then plays his voice-box / guitar, building up to a good climax at the end.  On this song ""Do You Feel Like We Do?"" Frampton's solo work differs from the ""Frampton Comes Alive"" version -- it is rather abbreviated, and not as fluid as his 1976 performance.  Also, his voice-box work features different lines, such as ""Do You Feel Horny?"" and ""Thank You!""  If you're a purist like me and are looking for a performance similar to that on ""Frampton Comes Alive"" CD it is a bit different on ""Do You Feel Like We Do?"".

The other songs that I thought were great were the 2 pieces in the encore.  Overall, I enjoyed the 70's songs more than the recent songs.

I really wish that someday, they would release the DVD of the classic performance by Frampton in 1976. It's too bad that this is the only DVD available right now of Frampton's live work.

One of the best segments in the Special Features is the video interview of Frampton.  Frampton talks about his beginnings and his experiences with bands such as Humbie Pie, his quick rise to fame after Frampton Comes Alive, and his relationship with Steve Marriott, and then how this performance in Detroit came together.  I really enjoyed this interview. It is a rare glimpse into the heart and thoughts of an outstanding musician. Frampton is a very down-to-earth and honest guy.

If you enjoyed Frampton's guitar playing, you will not want to miss his playing on The Best of Ringo Starr DVD which is also available.  Frampton absolutely rocks in his guitar playing and singing of ""Sunshine of Your Love,"" (w/ Jack Bruce) and ""Norwegian Wood"" (solo).  You'll definitely want to check out this DVD.

I give this DVD 4 1/2 stars.  The sound and picture quality are both excellent.",1150329600,13,2570,4.572052401746725
1087348,5,6305837074,"If you are looking for a show that make you feel you are alive, and to see a man with his band like nobody else playing the best music they can, this is. ok, he loose some hair, but who cares?

We ended up in the 9th row.  Having grown up in the 80's, I missed out on a lot of this music the first time around and had no idea what to expect out of this concert.  I can tell you, IT ROCKED!!!  We were about halfway through the concert before Frampton announced that a Live DVD was being made, so when you see the fans (myself included) standing up and cheering in the early part of the show, it is not contrived for the video.  It is the real thing! Since this show, I have purchased Comes Alive on CD and have the CD version of Live in Detroit (naturally) but in my opinion, Live in Detroit is so much better!  Obviously, the DVD has more material on it, but I would HIGHLY recommend either the CD or the DVD.  You won't be sorry.",1140652800,,914,4.067039106145251

1087352,5,6305837074,"A stella performance from a true survivor of the 1970's.

Hard to fault the performance in anyway, the band is great & this reminds us all of what an integral part of the Peter Frampton show the late Bob Mayo was.

Bonus interview is good, but the 5.1 channel mix is what really shines through. It really does give the fans a good opportunity to catch up with the great songs from 'Frampton Comes Alive'.

I saw Frampton in May 2005 live in Melbourne & he was fantastic, even better then 'David Bowie' on his 'Reality' tour from 2004.",1121385600,,534,4.373737373737374

I also enjoyed Peter's interview for the DVD.  Very informative and entertaining.
Peter's guitar work absolutely smokes!",1083024000,7,309,5.931818181818182
1087434,5,6305837074,Wow!  Wasn't really expecting too much from this.  Reality always seems to disappoint when one's memories have had too long to crystalize.  This was certainly the exception to the rule.  Frampton has lost none of his talent and his voice is as crisp as ever.  His guitar playing only seems to have improved.  It just goes to show that a great talent (like a good wine) only gets better w/ age.  This is almost never the case w/ one-hit wonders.  I'll buy a ticket the next time he plays live in my area.,1074816000,4,503,4.333333333333333

He might not have all the energy that he once did, but he can still sing and play like he did in his younger years.  The sound/video quality was A+",1053907200,,250,4.297872340425532
1087436,4,6305837074,This DVD has excellent video as well as audio (DTS). The interveiw with PF is indepth without being too detailed. It's laid back but not boring. A real plus is that it doesn't interrupt the concert footage. A few times the the band kind of goofs around a little and this seems to disrupt the pace of the show. But Frampton is as much up on his vocals and chops as I have ever heard him. He has a good bunch of players with him including Bob Mayo who was with him back in the seventies. Overall this is a good concert performance. A real treat if your a Frampton fan.,1041379200,,566,4.108108108108108
1087437,2,6305837074,"Unless you're a rabid fan of Frampton it's kinda sad seeing him up there with this lacklustre band churning out those classics from Frampton Comes Alive - sure, his voice is totally intact, his guitar playing is all there and he looks healthy enough (although it's pretty hard reconciling this trim, greying and bespectacled mid-lifer with the image of that 70's rock star with the Roger Daltery-esque curls.)  But it's a pretty shlocky concert and it just lack all the elements that defined him as a terrifically talented and cool star in the 70's.

1087439,5,6305837074,"When I bought this DVD, I had just set up my Sony 5.1 DTS system. I had no idea I would be transported back to 1976...the only noticeable difference is that Peter Frampton plays and sings better than ever. Bob Mayo is simply astounding on keys, guitar and vocals. There is a seamless comradery between these guys that is a pure delight to watch, not to mention that they are without a doubt the tightest, most polished sounding foursome out there today. The sound quality of this DVD is better than any other Concert DVD I own, James Taylor Live at the Beacon, a close second. One of Peter's many strengths has always been drawing a crowd into an experience and making them feel a part of his world. Forget the hair, he looks better than ever (laid-back and on fire all at the same time) and he's proven to this viewer/listener that he's never been more alive than he is today! A must-have for any guitar lover (worth buying a DVD player to see). My personal faves: ""Lines on My Face,"" ""Can't Take That Away,"" Don't Need No Doctor,"" and ""Money.""",1005955200,10,1045,4.447916666666667
1087440,4,6305837074,"I am a big fan of Peter Frampton and the performance in Detroit was top-notch. My only gripe is with the audio quality of this performance. If you compare the sound quality of this performance with the James Taylor Live at Beacon Street Concert, you'll see what I mean. If the sound quality of the Frampton concert had been better, I would have rated it a 5.",998697600,,358,4.358208955223881
1087441,4,6305837074,An extraordinary performance from a band. This concert cooks and I sat back in awe at the Keys\Gat performance of the player from Frampton comes alive.

PETER FRAMPTON WAS MY VERY FIRST CONCERT AS A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD. SAW HIM AGAIN LIVE ON HIS ""BREAK'N ALL OF THE RULES"" TOUR IN THE EARLY NINTIES. THIS MASTERPIECE BROUGHT EVERYTHING FRAMPTON IS ABOUT RIGHT INTO MY LIVING ROOM AS WELL AS MANY OTHERS. I HAVE NEVER THOUGHT THAT THIS SINGLE PERFORMANCE WOULD BRING SO MANY PEOPLE TOGETHER AS KIDS IN THEIR EARLY TEENS AND ADULTS IN THEIR FIFTIES HIGH FIVED TO FRAMPTON AND HIS STYLE OF MUSIC AND HIS GUITAR HERO STATUS. THE GREATEST QUOTE I'VE HEARD IN A LONG TIME WAS FROM SOMEONE IN THEIR EARLY TWENTIES PROCLAIM, ""IT SHOULD BE ILLEGAL FOR GUYS THAT OLD TO ROCK THAT HARD!!!!""IF YOU LIKE PETER FRAMPTON, BUY THIS DVD AND SHARE IT WITH FRIENDS AND STRANGERS ALIKE! HISTORY IS REPEATING IT SELF.  "" FRAMPTON COMES ALIVE AGAIN!!!""",991353600,5,945,4.46242774566474

1087589,5,6305837074,"ADD THIS DVD TO YOUR LIBRARY TODAY ! Peter Frampton has sold enough albums that everyone on the planet has heard his music. Watching this concert it  feels as if he is singing just to you. ""Stairway to Heaven"" by  Led Zeppelin is certainly considered/played songs of the last 30 years.  ""Lines on My Face"" is all over it with soft arpeggios and searing  guitar riffs. Some say Clapton is the guitar god, and he is truly  incredibly....but move over, Peter Frampton rocks !",967766400,2,472,4.571428571428571
1087590,5,6305837074,Peter Frampton rocks in 1999 as good as he did in 1975!  This is a great concert to own.  Picture and sound are  unbelievable.  What is even more unbelievable is to see Peter play guitar  at age 50 as good as he did at age 25.  His voice was excellent and his  band couldn't be better.  A must have for those of us who were there when  he did it the first time!,966384000,3,361,3.835616438356164
1087591,4,6305837074,"I only gave this video a score of 4 stars because I went to see Peter at Pine Knob two nights ago (Sat. August 12, 2000).  There isn't a video out  there that can truly capture the feeling of being there, but if you can't  take in a Frampton concert at The Knob, this is the next best thing to  being there.  I saw this DVD at a friends house on a monster TV running  through a Harmen-Karden (sp) surround sound system at an ear-shattering  volume.  Peter Frampton is still the best live ticket in town.  Don't pass  up this chance to add this DVD to your live concert library.",966124800,,577,4.163636363636364
1087592,5,6305837074,"I have to confess, when I first watched this dvd, tears came to my eyes. I  don't know why, I guess it moved me that much. I have been a Frampton fan  since  I heard Comes Alive back in 76. This dvd is GREAT. The picture  quality is superb, the sound is supurb, and  just the way the whole thing  was put together is totally awesome. Frampton is playing in Detroit at the  Pine Knob Ampitheater, in front of a packed house. The crowd enthuasium is  very high, and Frampton gets it up even higher. He plays all his old hits  like, Baby I love Your Way, Show Me The Way, Do You Feel Like We Do, and  some other old stuff, as well as some newer stuff. I must say, that he has  not lost it. He still has that distinguishable guitar sound and voice that  we as Peter Frampton fans love. If you close your eyes while you have this  dvd playing, you could almost swear that it was 1976 all over again.  People, this dvd is really that good. I highly recommend it to Frampton  fans(A MUST HAVE) and music lovers everywhere....",965952000,46,1018,4.148717948717949
1087593,3,6305837074,"First of all, I will admit that I am not a particular Peter Frampton fan  so my opinion my be biased.
I would have to say that it does sound very  similar to a lot of live concerts that I have been to, I had difilculty  understanding what the artist was singing.  It occurred to me when I heard  Peter speaking that there was significant reverberation going on.  I then  noticed two microphones attached to the mic boom which confirmed to me that  reverbeeration was intended to, I assume, mask a lacking singing voice.  Granted, he is an exceptional guitarist and the insturmental portions of  the disc are excellent.  Speaking of excellent, I would agree that the  video portion was also top notch with the exception of some over exposure  here and there.
In my opinion if you are seeking a music concert disc  that rates 5 stars in both image and sound you should purchase James  Taylor, Live at the Beacon Theater or Eagles When Hell Freezes Over.  Tina  Turner - Live in Amsterdam is another excellent choice but not quite to the  level of the other two.",965347200,3,1059,4.5132275132275135

We have an AC-3 system and our house has never rocked like it did when we started this DVD. I go back to Humble Pie days  with Peter and his dedication to his music over the years has truly paid  off.  A superb musician with a touch for perfection embodies the soul of  this performance.  We have an extensive collection of laser disc and  DVD  concerts, but this one sits right up there as one of our both all time  favorites.

Better yet it's also available on cd.  Either way you won't be disappointed.  He is like a fine wine and gets better with age.  I Don't Need No Doctor  will blow you away.  Not to mention there's a special treat here for the  first time live with Oh For Another Day.  If You Say Goodbye is a new song  and it is excellent.  And all the old favorites sounding better than  ever....  So go ahead treat your self. It's Peter Frampton at his  absolute best.
