5078944,1,B007CZAUM4,"Buyer Beware!  This is an illegal bootleg copy of the She-Ra cartoon series.  There has not been an official Region 1 release of She-Ra, Princess of Power in the United States.",1113609600,8,176,4.645161290322581
5078945,5,B007CZAUM4,I've always hoped that She-Ra would be back on DVD soon since other 80's cartoons have made a comeback.  I've looked on Ebay but was always spectacle of ordering from there because of bad quality in the past!  I must say I was thoroughly impressed with this DVD.  The picture and sound quality are awesome!  I just hope the distributor will be able to get more episodes released soon or if Filmation will ever release the entire series!  Buy this DVD to add to your collection!,1110844800,23,477,4.5
5078956,1,B007CZAUM4,Wait for an official release from BCI.  This is a bootleg and has no extra's. It's a 50 cent DVD-R with 6 episodes om it. She-ra will be officially released by BCI pending the sales performance of He-man in the fall.,1113696000,70,216,4.2682926829268295
5078957,5,B007CZAUM4,"Loved the show, loved the DVD! My Prayer request...more volumes please!! From the #1 She Ra fan",1113696000,,95,4.647058823529412
5078958,4,B007CZAUM4,It's nice to see the return of one of my childhood favorites to dvd! The dvd contains six episodes that will definitely bring memories to any girl who grew up in the 80s. I only wished the dvd contained more bonus material such as interviews with the directors and writers. I definitely recommend this dvd.,1113696000,7,306,4.581818181818182
5078959,1,B007CZAUM4,"As a few others have already mentioned, this disc is a bootleg.  Entertainments Rights has yet to license She-Ra for a Region 1 release.  Don't be fooled!",1113696000,10,154,4.666666666666667
5078960,1,B007CZAUM4,"This is an illegal bootleg DVD. It is not official in anyway.  Look closely at the packaging design and the odd ""DVD"" logo.  This is not anywhere near being official, do NOT buy.",1113696000,12,178,4.363636363636363
5078961,5,B007CZAUM4,This DVD is so incredibly amazing.  6 Episodes that allow me to remember how great life was like when I was younger.  If only there were more shows like this that taught morals and good values.,1113609600,,193,4.333333333333333
5078962,5,B007CZAUM4,"Awesome to finally get a chance to see this toon again.  DVD has 6 episodes in good quality.  If you have some $$ lying around, here's a worthwile investment.",1113609600,8,158,4.413793103448276
5078963,5,B007CZAUM4,"Oh Wow!  I absolutely just loved this show when I growing up.  My brother had He-man, I had She-Ra.  Getting this DVD and rewatching definitely brought back some old memories.  This for sure is a timeless classic.  Boys, this would be a perfect birthday present for significant other *hint, hint* :)",1113609600,,299,4.784313725490196
5078964,5,B007CZAUM4,"Yes!  Finally!  I thought I would have to wait forever for a chance to own this on DVD.  Now, I just hope that more are released to please this die-hard She-Ra fan!",1113609600,,164,4.0625
5078965,5,B007CZAUM4,"Finally, She RA is released on dvd. After being one of the most popular cartoons of the 80s one would think that this would have happened years ago. Sure it took awhile, but it's worth it. Onto the dvd, it features 6 episodes (random I believe). The extras  can be overlooked since one particular episode has He-Man in it (yes!).  The colors are vibrant and don't seem dated for a show this old. Overall this dvd was a welcome suprise. My only gripe is that it didn't feature any toy commercials.  I also think this is an international release as the the box states several other viewing regions.",1113609600,4,596,4.5

8514808,5,B007CZAUM4,"I grew up on this show. I had the dolls. My sister and I played She-Ra for hours. I just don't understand why this show gets dumped off the airwaves and trash like ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" and ""Pokemon"" gets put on instead. This was one of the few really good kids shows, with no sex and bad language, and little violence. And also the cartoon characters were teaching kids the valuable lessons of life (being role moldels). Where has childrens programming gone?",1131062400,3,468,4.650602409638554
8514809,4,B007CZAUM4,"I gave this DVD a 4 star rating only because of the quality of the product. The plastic container is cheap though the transfer was quite nice. The sound quality is excellent and for a straight to DVD non remastered DVD of 6 episodes, i thought it was worth the buy. Until BCI and MAttel come to some sort of agreement, i think this is your best bet until then.",1130284800,3,360,4.1571428571428575
8514810,5,B007CZAUM4,"I am unsure if this disc is a bootleg.  I was so unhappy with toy ratios with Mattel's released toy line in the new MOTU line that any DVD with He-Man or She-Ra is welcome.

I bought this disc because I love the characters.  Really brought back some memories of good times and raised hope of seeing other shows (more Masters of the Universe, She-Ra, Transformers Headmasters, Robots in Disguise, Beast Machines, etc.) to be released.

The disc has a good picture and sound.  There are three rough animation spots during the last episodes (fortunately in minor sequences).  Overall, the transfer looks better than some of the transfers of the original Transformers cartoon from 1984 by Rhino released in their boxed sets.

Mattel, please force your partners (animation studios, accountants, producers, etc.) to release all of MOTU and She-Ra Princess of Power on DVD.  You'll see so many sales that you'll want to release the toys again.  And this time, please don't produce so MANY He-Mans and Skeletors -- take a note from the Playmates TMNT line!  I can actually find one of most characters released. =)",1117843200,3,1105,4.86096256684492
8514811,5,B007CZAUM4,"I just got the DVD and it is great! I loved watching She-Ra when I was young. I wish I would have taped it then, but I am soooo grateful that they are now putting it on DVD! This is an excellent buy if you are a She-Ra and He-Man fan!",1115337600,13,234,3.607843137254902
8514812,5,B007CZAUM4,"Picking this dvd up a week ago was definitely a great move. Having not seen the show for over 15 years, I was thrilled to finally see my favorite heorine Adora aka She-Ra in dvd quality. I highly recommend this dvd for any child of the 80s.",1115078400,2,240,4.127659574468085
8514813,5,B007CZAUM4,"Just finished viewing this DVD and I can honestly say not bad at all.  I wasn't expecting much because quite a few of the other 80s toons I've picked up on DVD have been lacking.  But this DVD didn't dissapoint.  It has 6 episodes-I'm not sure they're in chronological order though.  The quality is quite good as well.  If you loved this cartoon from way back yonder, do yourself a favor and pick this one up.

-Jax",1114646400,,415,4.324675324675325
8514814,5,B007CZAUM4,"This is an awesome DVD!  I absolutely love it!  For those of us who grew up watching and playing She Ra, this DVD instantly takes you back.  I forgot about all of the life lessons at the end of each episode...  Absolutely terrific!",1113782400,15,231,4.3023255813953485
8514815,5,B007CZAUM4,"After finally receiving my dvd this past week I thought I might as well contribute a review to this product. First of all, this is NOT a US release. Rather it is an international dvd release of She Ra (sold overseas I assume-->the region 2 & 4 are a dead giveaway). Unlike the previous reviewers who did not bother to look at the item's description which clearly states Region 1 ""import,"" I can assure you that this dvd is actually factory produced. I mean I was a little skeptical after purchasing some She Ra sets on Ebay, but this dvd is actually authentic...not a dvdr like some of the prior reviewers would want people to believe, despite the fact that they probably never even purchased the product...oh well.

As for the dvd itself, the video quality was suprisingly good for a show this old. The dvd features a main menu that has access to an animated episode selection screen and a bonus screen. The bonus primarily consists of short bios of Adora, Bow, and Glimmer.

In the end, the dvd was everything I hoped it would be.  If you are unwilling to wait for a US release (who knows when Entertainment Rights will find a US distributor) then I would definitely recommend this DVD to hold you over until some US company finally decides to distribute it over here.",1113696000,15,1270,4.537117903930131
