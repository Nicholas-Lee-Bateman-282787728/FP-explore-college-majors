It was such a basic set up of a story.  catastrophe causing pockets of humans to struggle, conflict in leadership. One good guy, one bad guy...murderous ( insert villian of your choice Zombie, Vampire, cannibals) attack and the couple in love survives to find a new hope for Mankind.  Blech.
  I was hoping to see more of atticus mitchell in this, but unfortunately he was one of the first to bite it.
 This is something I might watch if it was on basic cable and I was too lazy to find the remote, but I regret paying 10 dollars.",1377388800,2,681,4.232558139534884

5832968,3,B00DMEC0WW,"Someone has fiddled with the weather, and mankind has become a few small collections of people fighting to survive against each other and a mutilated flu virus. Then the horror starts. Somehow it does not sound all that original.

The action itself although it tended to drag on, did have some interesting moments.

The filming itself was fairly ordinary. There were no fantastic special effects.

The acting itself was disappointing. You have some really good actors like Laurence Fishburne and they came out quite flat. None of the characters I thought were particularly interesting.

If you have nothing to do one evening, it may be worth a watch.",1375142400,23,650,4.9907407407407405

5832971,3,B00DMEC0WW,"The film opens as a prepper's orgasm. 400 hundred people live underground in a self sufficient colony. The world has been hit by climate change, famine, and disease. Apparently the flu virus survives year round frozen temperatures. People who have a disease, are killed or forced to leave the colony to prevent infection. Briggs (Laurence Fishburne) is in charge of the colony. His antagonist is Mason (Bill Paxton) a man who has his own, less humane set of survival ethics.

When an incident happens at Colony 5 (they are #7) Briggs takes off to investigate along with Sam (Kevin Zegers) plus token landing party victim.

The post apocalyptic scenery was good. The acting was good. The plot didn't really go anywhere that I found interesting. I don't want to give a lot away, but they spent a lot of time building Sam's character for him to be the most boring of the lot. Things do pick up when they get to Colony 5, but it was too late in the film for them to finally introduce the action scenes.

A soft 3 stars.

5832977,3,B00DMEC0WW,"Released in 2013, The Colony is a post-apocalyptic movie about life in North America after the next ice age hits.  Laurence Fishburne stars as the leader of an underground colony with Bill Paxton (R.I.P.) as his problematic assistant. Kevin Zegers plays a younger guy who rises to the challenge when contact with a neighboring colony is lost and a trio treks the winter wilderness to check on the status of its inhabitants.

My wife watched this movie on DVD before I did and, knowing it was some kind of wintery post-apocalyptic movie, I naturally asked her: Are there mutants in it? By mutants I meant, of course, any number of antagonists typical to the genre  zombies, cannibals, diseased tramps, monsters, etc. She didn't respond, but I knew the answer and was right. So this is a hackneyed post-apocalyptic movie; the question is: Does it rise to the challenge within that increasingly stale sci-fi/horror/action genre? Is there something about it thats fresh and invigorating?

The answer is no. There are obvious elements of numerous similar flicks, like The Day After Tomorrow (2004), Day of the Dead (1985), The Thing (1982), Aliens (1979), Aliens (1986) and the first two Planet of the Apes movies (1968, 1970). That said, The Colony is solid for what it is, which is helped by the fact that it doesnt overstay its welcome at 94 minutes. The CGI backdrops are convincing, albeit a little cartoonish, and I found myself drawn into the world of the characters. Its a good thing Charlotte Sullivan is on hand as the protagonists babe, though.

The dramatic first half of the movie is a slow-build to the action-packed second half with its revelation of the main villain(s), which is underwhelming when revealed (Im not going to give it away). I will say that there is a character played by Dru Viergever whos garbed like Pinheads little brother or perhaps a rejected vampire from Underworld (2003). Whatever the case, I chuckled a few times upon eyeing his stereotypical menacing expressions/antics.

The movies further brought down by the predictable political correctness wherein the sage leader is a seasoned black man and his unofficial second-in-command is a moral, intelligent & beautiful white woman. These two are naturally contrasted by the selfish and sociopathic ""aging white guy,"" a symbol of all that is wrong with the world (rolling my eyes).

A Canadian production, the movie was shot at some defunct underground power plant in North Bay, Canada, with (I presume) establishing shots from Lapland, Finland, and studio work done in Toronto. DIRECTOR: Jeff Renfroe. WRITERS: Renfroe, Patrick Tarr, Pascal Trottier & Svet Rouskov. Atticus Mitchell has a small role.

GRADE: C

ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY ***SPOILER ALERT*** (Dont read unless youve seen the movie):

The aforementioned mutants turn out to be merely ""humans gone feral, as Fishburnes character describes them. Cracked cannibals or not, wouldnt their priority be acquiring food supplies rather than senseless slaughter? Moreover, does it make sense to forgo a good take of fresh meat to wander the ruthless winter wilderness searching for even more food when its not a for sure endeavor? Do farmers slaughter all their livestock at once? There are too many logical holes.",1492732800,,3249,5.090225563909774

5833007,2,B00DMEC0WW,"I generally like post-apocalyptic fiction.  This was not quite what I expected:  more of a horror flick than an action movie.  The character development is pretty sparse, and 45 minutes into the film I found myself not caring very much who lived or died.  The action scenes are very choppy (similar style to the first Hunger Games) and have poor lighting, building suspense but making it difficult to follow exactly what's happening or even who is involved in the fighting.  The climactic scene was extremely gory but was the one well-written bit in the movie, where viewers are pushed to think about how the villains got to be the way they are and how little it would take for our hero to cross that line (he does but then pulls himself back).  Like some of the other reviewers, I would have liked more denouement; the movie ends abruptly with just a glimmer of hope whereas I was hoping for a real ray of sunshine in the characters' bleak world.",1426982400,,947,4.57396449704142
5833008,2,B00DMEC0WW,"Gaaah.  I would have been fine suspending disbelief and giving this perfectly fine marks for a B sci-fi post-apoc flic.  It really it was almost there... Really almost OK. I didn't even mind all the stolen tropes.  Sure.  Post apoc, man screws weather into an ice age, sure fine.

But at some point all the logical jumps and ridiculous bits add up too much. By the end i was screaming at the TV ""just shoot the zombie boss you MORONS!!!!""

How do the zombies (yeah cannibals whatever) avoid the hail of bullets available to the non-'feral'?
How do the zombies escape the dynamite caved in tunnel?
How do the zombies make it all the way to the helicopter - a day long trip apparently - first thing in the morning if the night temps are so horrible?
How do the zombies get around the blown out bridge in no time if its such an insurmountable chasm?
Where did they spend the nights on this long detour if the temps are so horrible?
Why doesnt our hero shoot the damn boss zombie across the bridge since its clear the hord is run by him?
How do zombies with blunt objects and a few knives repeatedly get through massive metal doors? Super zombies? But why couldn't they get through that one guys metal door?
How is it that nobody just shoots the boss zombie in the colony? Clearly you shoot the boss and the others will be clueless.
How is it that yet again the colonists with guns blast away and nearly no zombies (sorry ""cannibals"") get hit? How stupid and uncoordinated are these colonists? (Sorry - forgot - ground rules for all bad movies - good guys can never shoot for crap until the end scene and then only if you're lucky).

5833010,2,B00DMEC0WW,There was nothing new about this movie. I didn't feel like there was plot to pull someone into the storyline or to make the endless winter significant. It seemed to me to be a typical cannibal/terror sort of movie. I regret wasting my money on it.,1423353600,,247,4.391304347826087
5833011,2,B00DMEC0WW,"From the description of the movie, my expectations were for a completely different sort of movie. I went in expecting an intelligent and interesting treatment of technology and society for isolated colonies of people surviving an ice age. What we get instead is just lip service (literally ... a couple of lines of dialogue here and there) to that concept. The rest of the movie is nothing more than the standard chase and gore-fest that you get in any cheap horror movie. The ""bad guys"" might as well be zombies, as they are nothing more than the same type of mindless appetite.

The brief attempts to explore anything remotely like an interesting alternate society are brief and meatless, introduced for the sole purpose of trying to warm up some character conflict which ultimately goes nowhere. Unless Fishburne and Paxton are the types who are satisfied with any payday, they have to be VERY unhappy to ultimately have their name associated with this mess.

Normally when I see a title with big names and absolutely no memory of promotion for theater dates, I suspect that there are problems afoot, and rarely does that internal warning turn out to be wrong. This thing was filmed for 16 million and evidently immediately was relegated to the shelves. I can understand why it was released to cable/streaming, but why they even bothered with DVD and Blu ray release is a mystery.

5833016,3,B00DMEC0WW,An average post apocalyptic film with a poor ending.  It started out good and was fairly entertaining until it just abruptly ended.

The cover art to this DVD is just so deceptive, as you see military helicopters being shot down. Then you see the three principle actors running for their lives over a burning bridge - which not a true reflection of what happens, in the film, either! I guess the beginning of the movie sets a sort of interesting atmosphere, where there is an ice - age environmental catastrophe. The film boasts some relatively good set of actors - alas, they seem to be there more for `window dressing' rather than as a vehicle for good narrative. For me, the film just turns into clich&eacute;d set pieces that are not knitted well into the fabric of the narrative, with half-developed characters and their various interactions.

This viewer came away thinking there is nothing special here, that you have not already seen in many other productions. The movie is at best, is badly edited/abridged B-movie. I do not understand what they were thinking when they story-boarded this film, or maybe they did nothing of the sort.

5833035,1,B00DMEC0WW,"Ugh. This film left a bad taste in my mouth. Why? Because of the potentially great ingredients this film had going. 1.) An isolated environment that would breed suspense, mystery and paranoia. 2.) Bill Paxton. 3.) Laurence Fishburne. So what went wrong? Read on, good reader, but there are spoilers ahead.

THE STORY: (SPOILERS!) The earth is in deep freeze, much of the population gone except those lucky enough to survive in isolated outposts (colonies). Food is scarce, and people are getting sick. Bad luck with no end in sight. When one outpost A loses communication with outpost B, they send  a team to investigate. The team runs into cannibals that killed everyone in outpost B and all of the investigative team except for one guy. Said cannibals follow the last surviving member back to Outpost A, and the battle begins. It it sounds like it was written by a third-grader. Simple. No surprises. No plot twists, and really no real ending (YAY!). Absolutely. Horrible. Apparently Paxton and Fishburne's characters knew each other (they served together rationing food once), but Paxton is just a bad guy. No real explanation for it. Just insert bad Bill Paxton here.

THE DIRECTION: If I said it was really terrible that would be an insult to really terrible things. NEVER give this guy another movie. EVER. Awful use of music, no real character development, and absolutely no (ZERO) suspense. Predictable from a hero dying in a bridge explosion to an anti-hero dying in a propane explosion. SOME ADVICE FOR THE DIRECTOR: Do not hang the camera on shots with bad CG, and try to create a main villain that is..well scary. Billy Zane on steroids with filed teeth isn't scary...not even with TWO chains draped over his shoulder...we all know someone with chains on their shoulder is bad, right? I mean if the twenty 1980's gang bangers from Rumble in the Bronx are wrong then I don't wanna be right. (HUGE face-palm)

THE ACTING: The script is really horrible. I am a big fan of both of these actors (Paxton since the Terminator, and Fishburne since Apocalypse Now) but they have very little to work with here. No one else really distinguishes themselves, but I would like to what Charlotte Sullivan could do with a better script. The main villain is horrible. The director seems to think all the villain has to do is scream in close-up, and that is scary. It's not scary, but it is unintentionally laughably funny.

THE SPECIAL FX: Bad, but not terrible.. I don't know if it is the cinematography, flat lighting or the compositing, but something doesn't work. When you see it, you will know what I mean. Something about it lacks polish.

THE SOUND: No real complaints, no real praises.

THE MUSIC: Ugh. Every action scene in the movie has a rock/industrial track. VERY creative! Did it follow Morpheus from the Matrix? MESSAGE TO THE COMPOSER: You CAN use different TYPES of music to set what we call MOOD. I'll cut him a little slack, because at the end of the day it is the directors show, and boy is this guy really awful.

OVERALL: A real bomb here. Stay far away. Despite the big names attached to this picture, it feels very low-budget to me. I suspect the money went to Paxton/Fishburne.  The script is bad, the CG is bad, the overall story is bad, and the music is inappropriately bad. Treat this movie as it were a Terminator or an Agent, and just avoid it entirely.",1412380800,,3378,4.702199661590525
5833036,5,B00DMEC0WW,"Good balance of action, writing, and though provoking concepts.  This movie has the Fishbourne expected gripping monolog. What is great is screen time and story development is not dominated by Fishbourne, other characters allowed to showcase their acting chops; which allows for a more rounded movie.  SPOILLER ALERT...the movie takes an unexpected turn when pseudo-Zombies are found.  This isn't low brow or clich it touches on post-apocalyptic concepts and is an unexpected turn in the story line.
 The movie itself is a good action/thriller/sci-fi flick.  If you are looking for a movie that has an Indy feel but at the same time contemporary and relevant this is the movie.  Many reviewers say its formulaic and cheesy, but I think that is due to the reviews not understanding the nuanced story line and seeing the action as simply action and not as a relevant aspect of pacing and story development.
It the dystopian future genre this film offers a unique take, offers a world that is in the grips of a planetary freeze due to global warming.  Tis film includes familiar concepts:  post-apocalypse, environment catastrophe, wastelands, and yes even zombies.  But it does it in a fresh modern take that does not make it seem clich or a jumble of recycled concepts; but rather like an Indy film that uses action as a tool to propel the story and the viewer.",1412294400,3,1360,4.878260869565217

The movie sits right there with films like: 28 Days Later (2002), The Day After Tomorrow (2004), 30 Days of Night (2007), Mad Max trilogy, The Thing (1982 or 2011).  The Colony is suspenseful and beautifully shot/filmed; although, I believe that is all do to special effects.  The plot is not at all clich, its rather interesting and thrilling.  The acting is believable and professional.  I think the part were the expedition, composed of the three colonists, find themselves in the colony they are investigating could have been extended by another 10 minutes or so with the guys being chased around by the infected crowd.  This way it would have been more exciting to watch the developing thrill ride, and the build up for the final encounter would have been even much better.  Furthermore, the movie does not have an intense enough music score to highlight its suspense.  With a better soundtrack (more dramatic musical score) The Colony could have been really something.",1411257600,3,1042,5.052631578947368
5833041,3,B00DMEC0WW,"At first, I was going to leave my reading light on and read, but decided to check it out. My daughter rented the Netflix and put it on. I was attracted to Larry Fishburne being in it but it took a little bit to recognize Bill Paxton, one of the bad guys. The other actors I've never heard of.

The story was really for the young stud and the blonde in Angelina Jolie cornrows (from whatever that previous movie was were Angelina wore those things). When I saw the actresses name, I still had no idea who she was. Anyway, others have already gone over the plot so I'll just give my impressions of why I wasn't over-thrilled with this movie.

Set in a bleak and harsh world, some like Fisburne take a gentler approach, while others like Paxton go for the harsh side of things. Young stud, of course goes for gentle. When he follows Fishburne on a rescue mission to save another colony, things go wrong. They icky bugs, which I was hoping for, just turned out to be bad humans. In the beginning of the movie, the movie makers give the impression these people are something else. They also act superhuman when our heroes encounter them, yet they are nothing more than souped up bad guys that can run fast. Also, their motivation is kind of dumb. When young stud finally has an encounter with #1 baddie, he asks him what he wants. The bad guy's reply almost kills the reason for the movie.

Then there's the fact that the older cast members don't fare well. I'll just leave it at that but of course, appealing to the 18-49 demographic, the movie maker's want to get rid of the old fogies so young stud and Angelina Jolie clone in corn rows can ride off into the sunset. That's what was most clich about this movie, though I'm not so much against clichs, but being outside that 19-49 demographic, this crap just gets a bit old.

Overall, I can't say it was all a waste, but it wasn't a great movie either. Meh.",1411257600,,1904,4.354929577464789

He decides to investigate what is wrong along with his sidekick played by actor Kevin Zegers.

5833048,1,B00DMEC0WW,"Every once in a while a movie comes along that is so bad that it makes me think I could do better writing movies myself.  The Colony is one of these movies.

I won't go into the plot details  others have done that.  Besides, the plot is terrible no need to re-hash it.  However, I must point out some things that bothered me.

First, when the guys from Colony 7 blow up the entrance to Colony 5, the explosion makes no sense.  The entrance to Colony 5 is inside a giant brick smoke stack and down a tunnel.  I cant say how far down that tunnel goes, but it seems pretty far maybe 50 or 100 feet.  So in order to blow up the entrance and after escaping the crazed cannibals, one guy lights the fuse on a pack of dynamite Im thinking it was perhaps 3 sticks or 4 at the most.  Then he throws the dynamite back into the smoke stack entrance and the entire base of the stack explodes.  Now wait a minute  what happened to the tunnel going down?  If you throw dynamite into the entrance isn't it going to fall 50 or 100 feet before going off?  Watch the explosion (I did repeatedly)  the bottom of the stack explodes as though the dynamite were centered at the base of the stack.  Uhhhhhh. Its not.  It would have fallen down the tunnel.  Is this a minor point?  Id say no actually.  If someone throws dynamite down a hole Id expect the explosion to take place at the bottom of the hole, not at the top as thought the dynamite hovered in mid-air or something.

Second, ok so the entrance was blown up.  How do the cannibals then get out to track the guys back to Colony 7?  Wasnt the entrance (and exit) just blown to bits?  Well, perhaps there was a back door or something.

Third, exactly how many of these cannibals are there anyway?  I went back and watched sections of the film multiple times in order to count.  Yes I did.  Oh yes I did.  I watched and counted every cannibal that was killed.  My best estimate is that at least a total of 31 were killed.  After killing 10 at Colony 5, the guys from Colony 7 guess the number of cannibals pursuing them at 20 maybe more.  I paused the film and counted the number myself.  It is hard to tell, but it appears to be between 20-25.  My best guess was 21.

On the bridge, they kill at least another 6.

Back at Colony 7, they kill at least 15.

Well, between the bridge and back at Colony 7, thats at least 21.

Why does this matter?  Because I think a relevant question is whether there are any cannibals left by the end of the film.  If none are left, why the urgency to flee?

Sooooo anyway lets back up a minute so the guys from Colony 7 blow up a bridge in order to stop the cannibals from tracking them back.  Uhhh which doesnt work because they still track them back anyway.  Uhhhhh so what was the point of the bridge?  I guess that there was a pretty easy way around or something?  Cant say for sure but it looked like a very long drop into a frozen river or something.  These cannibals must be really special because first they escape Colony 5 after the entrance is blown up and then they get around a bridge after that is blown up.  Not only that, they get around within basically one day which would be at least one whole day out in the elements after they spent the prior day out in the elements tracking the guys from Colony 7 as well.  Uhhhh so that would mean that these cannibals were out for two days and at least one full night running around in the snow, correct?

Which brings me to the utterly stupid way in which the cannibals infiltrate Colony 7.  This is ridiculous on multiple levels.  First of all, what kind of crappy door do they have anyway?  A bunch of crazy people with knives and crowbars are able to get the door open?  Is this some sort of plywood door they picked up at The Home Depot or something?  It appears to be a steel door, but I guess it was made in China because it is a piece of junk.

Regardless, the cannibals get the door open and then somehow get into the ductwork.  They don't come in the door at all they just are suddenly running around in the air ducts.  Huh?  How did they get in there?  Are they magic cannibals?  Do they have a teleporter like on Star Trek or something?  I don't get it.

Oh  and did anyone else note that the guys at Colony 7 have guns and the cannibals have knives?  Seems like pretty long odds for the cannibals, but what do I know.

Well, as I mentioned, I counted at least 21 cannibals getting killed back at Colony 7.  Thats 21 minimum  there is one scene involving an explosion that isn't clear.  If my numbers are even close to accurate, thats all of the cannibals dead.  If not, maybe one or two are still creeping around.  Ok so why does everyone flee Colony 7 right away?  Sure, some things are on fire, but the whole place isn't trashed.  How about getting some supplies before running off into an ice age or something?

So thats a lot of stupidity for one movie.  I didn't even get into the iffy explanation for the weather change and how the 2nd guy in charge at Colony 7 acts like a moron all the time for no apparent reason.  You know  the typical bad guy character that is incredibly stupid for no reason at all?  Thats him.  Im also not clear on why the cannibals felt the need to chase after two guys from Colony 7 when they had a giant pile of human meat waiting to be eaten at Colony 5.  They have so much meat it is hanging from the ceiling and walls.  So why chase after two guys for a couple days out in the snow?  Why not just eat the meat you have?",1408406400,7,5494,4.14638783269962
5833049,3,B00DMEC0WW,I like Lawrence Fishborne . It was not a bad story but your waiting and waiting and nothing . The end has no conclusion or something for us to ponder . It just ended like they cut the script in the middle of the story .,1408406400,,219,3.782608695652174

5833051,5,B00DMEC0WW,"The Colony is pretty awesome for a horror film.  I didn't expect this to be a horror actually.  This caught me by surprise!  I thought it would be a drama type film about people trapped in an underground building trying to survive an ice age.  Well... at first it *seems* that's what the film is going to focus on while emphasizing those who are possibly becoming sick having to spend time in the biocontainment room so as not to spread their germs.  However pretty soon we discover that the Colony is supposed to take place in the year 2045 where the snow doesn't stop falling due to the consequences of climate change.  Hmmm, makes me wonder if this could actually happen one day!  Well no, probably not the endless snow part, but a possible ice age doesn't seem unlikely by this point.  We *did* just have the worst winter ever recorded in the northeast this year after spending years with above average temperatures.  Makes a person wonder!

However after a while a few brave men (one of them played by the talented Laurence Fishburne) decide to distance themselves from the group and venture out on their own in the freezing cold to see if there's any more supplies elsewhere, not to mention another destination that could serve as useful with possible survivors roaming the place.  What these three men discover however, is a large group of vicious/relentless cannibal men just as desperate for survival as the normal people who entered the building.  Upon noticing the group of cannibals, they're seen cutting up and eating people and... UH OH! The brave men accidentally make a slight noise which catches the cannibals by surprise and... now the chase is on!  They run away while shooting at the cannibals trying to break free and escape the building by any means necessary (and succeed for a little while).

Well without giving too much away, not everyone survives, and the cannibals eventually find where the group of ice age survivors are staying.  This leads to one heck of a dramatic finish!  Lots of blood flying everywhere, stabbings out the wazoo, moments of carelessness concerning perfect opportunities to shoot an open target (*ahem!*  storyline flaw!) and more.  It seems whenever one of the cannibals leaves himself wide open, just then he gets this amazing burst of speed so the people aiming their guns can't even get off a single shot or can't make a clean escape.  Typical!

Well honestly for a while in the beginning I thought I was about to see a top-notch quality storyline focusing on the horrible nature of trying to survive the freezing cold since for the most part the writing feels very professionally done and the acting sincere and well-written.  Of course once the cannibals enter the picture the entire complexion of the story changes so any of the survival tactics that had so much potential during the first 20 minutes pretty much go out the window by this point, but if you're in the mood for a quality horror movie I think this one fits the bill quite well.  The acting is really good, there's quality moments of people turning on each other as a means to look at the bigger picture (surviving) and other interesting things.  Perhaps the film should have been 30 minutes longer since it feels somewhat rushed the way it is now and not giving Laurence Fishburne enough time in the spotlight to shine since he's clearly the best actor is a crime, but otherwise terrific movie!",1407369600,3,3415,4.741116751269035

In near future weather machines were build to control the climate change - but they malfunctioned... One day it began to snow and never stopped since... Most humans perished and the few survivors live in underground bunkers to escape the extreme cold of new Ice Age. In one such outpost, Colony 7, led by former soldiers Briggs (Laurence Fishburne) and Mason (Bill Paxton), a distress radio signal is received from Colony 5 - which after that remains silent... As Colony 5 is linked by a pact of alliance with Colony 7, Briggs takes two men, Sam (Kevin Zegers) and young Graydon (Atticus Dean Mitchell) and together they go to see what assistance they can offer. They will not like what they find... And then the film really begins...

This Canadian 2013 post-apocalyptic SF/horror had some potential, as the initial idea was good and the settings (grim industrial sites lost in the middle of frozen wastelands) were well done. At 16 million USD budget was honorable for a small production and two good, well known actors (Fishburne and Paxton) were hired. However, almost all this potential was cruelly wasted, mostly because of weakness of scenario, which seems have been written on the knee, during a short break taken by the scenarist from his day time job (which I would advise him NOT to quit...) .

Everything in this film is a clich and every single development can be anticipated like 10 minutes in advance. We are told who will be Ze Bad Guy (ZBG) in the first 30 seconds of the film (it is the character played by Bill Paxton) and just in case the first scene in the film doesn't identify ZBG clearly enough, oh, I don't know, let's just name him Mason, to make things more obvious...))) Dialogs are completely devoided of interest and the ONLY memorable line in the film is the one used as the title of this review. In fact, the writer of the scenario was so uncomfortable with dialogs, that just to save himself some effort he made certain that half of the characters are unable to speak at all...)))

Both renowned actors, Fishburne and Paxton, are completely wasted in this film - one (not saying which one) has not enough time screen and the other is asked to do and say things that he himself cannot believe he is doing/saying them, so stupid and illogical they are... The main female character, Kai (Charlotte Sullivan) is just there to make some figuration and the maon male character, Sam, is so pale and banal, that I completely didn't care what will happen to him... There are some action scenes, but they are really so lame that I simply fast forwarded them. Finally, last but not least, absolutely NOTHING in the story ever makes sense and every time when a promising idea or development appears, the director just kills ommediately the person who could carry them...

Bottom line, this film is a major disappointment and almost a case study about how NOT TO make films... Two stars only for some nice images of this frozen world - otherwise AVOID this thing as if it was Mutant Drug Resistant Ice Age Flu...",1405296000,,3276,4.65112262521589

5833078,4,B00DMEC0WW,"As others have noted, this was produced in Canada at a fraction of the cost of big-name Hollywood films but with only a fraction of the budget, still with decent enough computer graphics where needed.

I found the basic premise of the plot alone interesting enough that it carried me through watching to see how it all came out.  Mankind finally decided global warming is such a threat they install ""weather machines"" to cool the atmosphere.  Exactly how they worked, I don't think was explained or I've forgotten but no matter.  The important point is that they worked far too well, throwing the earth back into a very bad ice-age where pretty much everything is frozen.  What's left of mankind (at least what they can tell) are a few underground colonies built to withstand the constant cold.  There they must grow hydroponic plants and such, but it's not much of a life, and a power failure, a bad infection etc. could wipe out an entire colony.  The colonies within radio reach have a mutual-aid agreement.  This is where the plot begins.

Our heroes (in Colony 7) receive a distress call from Colony 5.  There's some bickering as to whether or not it's prudent to go, and whether a small crew could actually render any assistance or not, but the leader (played by Fishburne) insists they must honor the agreement and sets out with 2 others (one, inexperienced up topside).  They make it to colony 5 and find everyone apparently dead of unclear causes.  Blood on the floors and walls.  Investigating with trepidation, they find one guy locked in a room terrified, who explains they had heard a radio transmission that another colony had succeeded in reversing the operation of the weather tower, thawing the snow and ice, and were asking for help in the form of seeds to plant in the soil.  Colony 5 sent a team but they never returned.  What DID return, unfortunately, was a pack of CANNIBALISTIC humans eating any other survivors they can locate to survive.  They are the ones who wiped out the remainder of colony 5 (and probably the party that left it).

The group of three (the lone survivor of 5 is too traumatized to leave with them, condemning himself to a death by starvation if nothing else) head back to colony 7.  ""Say--we've got GOOD news, and BAD news...""  Along the way, the cannibals who destroyed colony 5 spot them.  Will they and their own colony suffer the same fate?  Fleeing the cannibals, will they lead them right to their own colony?  Should they stand there and die?  Is there REALLY a colony with arable soil?  Not all the questions are answered at the end (leaving room I suppose for a sequel if it made enough profit).

The acting was fair, dialog fair, the idea was new and interesting as far as an apocalyptic story is concerned, and it did hold my interest all the way to the end.  Be forewarned, there's enough violence in it that it's not a film I'd recommend for kids or young teens.  There's no nudity and no more vulgarity than one might expect of men in such a situation.  The visuals, both above ground and below, are well-done and make the world appear believable.",1398816000,4,3108,4.622262773722627

5833093,2,B00DMEC0WW,"Just moments ago I left a Review for the Europa Report and just like I said in that one.. I don't usually leave a review unless i am moved to an EXTREME...

And THE COLONY... moved me to an EXTREME.... ""TERRIBLE""

The premise of the story is Very Engaging.. Post Apocalyptic Earth and those that must find a way to survive on our frozen planet with no direct sunlight to sustain planetary life.... You've heard it before how will anyone possibly live under such extremes.. So again I say Very Engaging... However where the story takes you to in the 3rd act leaves a lot to be desired... I think they could have done a better job than they did.. I won't spoil the ending by telling you what they encounter but it does distract from the overall premise...

The story itself is Linear as you expect it to be.. Starts at point A with a problem that has to be overcome in order to move to point B and then enters a new problem which has to be overcome leading to Point C or the Climax... So FIVE STARS FOR a sound well structured plot.

THE ACTING:
First I have to say Bill Paxton may be one of the most active actors in Hollywood but Honestly Bill just didn't do it for me as a villain... I'm not really a Bill Paxton Fan to be honest and i don't know why--to be even more honest, I think the only thing I liked that he was in was Twister and U-571 and A Simple Plan, Anyway, I guess all i saw was Chet (from Weird Science circa 1985) when I was watching Bill act in this movie.

BUT... Laurance Fishbourne and Kevin Zegers....?????
Of course, this isn't Mr. Fishbourne's first apocalyptic movie (recall Apocalypse Now) so as a seasoned actor he new how to play the role in which he was cast for this Movie and i thought he did a good job. As a matter of fact, I felt that he and Mr. Zegers both did a good job portraying their characters.... and I only kept watching the movie because I wanted to know how these two characters were going to survive.

Anyway, two stars overall for THE COLONY.",1393027200,,1989,4.221052631578948

5833109,3,B00DMEC0WW,"The Colony is set in the near future of 2045 when the world is in the midst of an ice age and the remnants of human civilizations have moved into underground silos to escape the bitter cold and snow.  Colony 7 is led by former soldiers Briggs (Laurence Fishburne) and Mason (Bill Paxton).  The community is slowly shrinking due to outbreaks of flu but they manage as best they can, having created greenhouses to grow plants and a small supply of livestock.  Those who suffer from sickness are given the choice of leaving the colony and taking their chances in the open, or being shot on the spot.  Mason no longer wants to expend the colonies limited medicines on trying to cure the sick and begins executing the sick, against the orders of Briggs.

They receive a distress call from Colony 5 and Briggs, Sam (Kevin Zegers), and Graydon, leave to investigate.  Arriving at the colony they find the place covered in blood.  Eventually they come across a gruesome scene of a pack of cannibals who are cutting up and eating the remains of the colonists.  The men attempt to escape, blowing up the hatch behind them.  But the cannibals survive, following them back to Colony 7.

An interesting premise is marred by poor writing and gaping plot holes.  Upon reaching colony 5 they are able to view a garbled transmission from another colony that they have been able to repair their weather controlling machine and have been able to melt the snow and ice in a large radiusbut they have no seeds!  Incredible leap there that one colony is loaded with seeds and the other has none.  We are also to believe that all the weather machines just stopped, allowing the ice age to begin with no explanation as to why they failed.  Briggs blows up a huge section of a tall suspension bridge in order to stop the cannibals.  And yet somehow they manage to get around the gaping divide, arriving at the colony only a few hours later.  Of course this is all off camera.  Theres also no good explanation why mere colds and flu are able to kill the people even though they have medicines and a quarantine room.

Director Jeff Renfroe borrows far too much from 30 Days of Night, even to the point of the cannibals having their teeth filed like the vampires in that room.  Even the cannibal leader bears a resemblance to the vampire leader.  Decent premise and some harrowing action sequences make the film watchable but forgettable.",1391299200,,2410,4.612676056338028

People who are in desperate need will do just about anything and this movie gave us drama, thriller, and many scary moments when these crazed people came running  towards there shelter to eat them alive and kill. I'm not quite sure what else the other reviewers, were looking for in making this film a 4-5 star movie ,but this movie showed survival of an natural disaster.

5833112,2,B00DMEC0WW,"This was probably the wrong movie to watch in the middle of an annoyingly snowy winter. The Colony takes place in a future where the earth is covered with snow. So snow was outside covering the world in reality and for escapism, I watch people struggling to survive in a world covered in snow.

Unfortunately, that sort of coincidence was the only thing that made this movie remotely interesting.

It was odd big names like Bill Paxton and Laurence Fishburne were in this. It has very simple premise: since the surface is covered with snow, humanity lives in different colonies that hoard seeds and ration food. If you get sick you are quarantined and sent to die in the snow (or get shot.) The characters receive a distress signal from another colony and go to investigate.

Theres little to no mystery. I won't spoil it, but Ill just say that if youve seen any other science fiction movie in your entire life, you will probably be able to guess what they find. And you'll be able to guess everything that happens along the way. Even the cliched characters and their actions aren't explored or developed.

I hate to be so negative, there's usually something interesting in any film, but being honest, there is nothing new here. There's nothing original and nothing very exciting. It seemed better fitted for network TV filler. Even the SyFy network does better than this.

.I won't hold it against the film though because it gave me what i like in this type of rather nonsensical film. The filming was done in a greenish tint while inside and a blueish tint while outside.

There was a very gruesome scene that I loved when the colonists respond to a distress call from another colony and find a human butcher shop set up showing the cannibals sharpening their teeth with files and dismembering dead bodies while some were having a lite snack of hand sandwiches. It reminded me somewhat of the After dark film (Tooth and Nail) but Tooth and Nail being the superior film in my opinion.

There are power struggles within the Colony 'Bill Paxton's' character being the jerk of the bunch to Kevin Zegars nice guy with the good head on his shoulders.

So, it's lacking in every way, which is a shame with the plot and actors it had. Many films encompass qualities of several genres, but great, even good, movies are clearly distinctive of one genre. Personally, I love action, sci-fi, mystery/thriller, and dystopian future movies but I've never liked horror movies. I felt, however, they didn't commit to a full-on scary horror film, so it's just blah. To be an enjoyable action or mystery/thriller they needed more action or more mystery. And, either would have needed a lot more drama. Yes, drama. They needed to flesh out the story lines of the main characters, possibly by ""flashback"" scenes of how & WHY their colony came to exist. They mention it briefly once, but that wasn't enough to tell the story, their stories (and isn't that the purpose of a movie?). Or, they needed to make it the horror story I believe it was probably meant to be. And, that would have required a lot more gore!

5833126,3,B00DMEC0WW,"In the not too distant future the earth is covered in ice and snow of a new ice age. What is left of the human race gather together in underground colonies, harvesting seeds for crops, and genetically engineering livestock for food. The world these few survivors life in is a harsh one where the human races numbers are dwindling toward extinction and the common cold is a death sentence. The situation in Colony 7 is reaching a breaking point when they receive a distress signal from Colony 5 Briggs makes a decision to investigate with the aid of Sam, and Graydon. On their journey to Colony 5 and back they see horrors, and reach a discovery that might change the world.

The plot of The Colony is nothing original as it is a mash up of other films and ideas from The Day After Tomorrow, and even The Dawn of the Dead, yet the first two thirds of the film really works well as we see how life works in Colony 7. The conflict between two former soldiers and friends in Briggs (Laurence Fishburne), and Mason (Bill Paxton) who feels that the people infected with the cold virus shouldn't be given a choice, but instead just put to death. Then there are the interesting modern plot details that the film uses like The Svalbard Global Seed Vault, what people will do to survive when their starving and weather control machines or weather modification, which is already being done by cloud seeding for crops, but The Colony's writers take it to the next level. I wish director Jeff Renfroe, and the writers could have explored the colony life, and the giant weather modification machines that are hinted at being the cause of the ice age, but instead of focusing on those ideas Renfroe and his writers decided to go full zombie apocalypse's on the viewer. Sure they were cannibals not zombies, which was an interesting idea in an ice age where available food is few and far between, but the way Renfroe used these cannibals took away from the film, and the story. Maybe the introduction and use of cannibals could have worked if the running time of the film was longer instead of the short running time of ninety minutes.

The Canadian production of The Colony by RLJ Entertainment is really well polished, and rendered that includes the special effects from the giant weather machines to the frozen wasteland that is earth all of it looks believable, and well done. The acting was also well done as well with Laurence Fishburne giving a solid performance as does Bill Paxton in his conflicted role. Kevin Zegers is the star of The Colony as Sam who gives a strong performance in the starring role.

Ultimately with The Colony the viewer is left with what could have been had the film been longer or director Jeff Renfroe, and the writers decided to focus more on the science of weather modification, the characters, the colony, and human survival. Still The Colony is a decent sci-fi post-apocalyptic film with some interesting ideas that are never fully realized on film along with pretty good action, good acting/characters, and pretty decent effects that makes, and makes The Colony a film that should be given a chance.",1389052800,,3122,4.683060109289618

5833128,2,B00DMEC0WW,I see why this movie went straight to video. Alert Spoilers in Review:  I'm disappointed it did not use Laurence Fisheburn or Bill Paxton in an effective way.  It was only their great skills as actors that you can see them as more than one dimensional and Fishburne is luck to exit the film early on. Paxton wasn't so lucky but maybe he need the money. This story wasted a (not new) but potentially good idea by not developing the main or any characters in the colony so we'd care about their inevitable deaths or struggle to survive.  The super strong almost demon like villain and his converts were brought into the story with the weakest of explanations. Apparently the bug that killed mankind does this to people somehow. The ending makes no sense as the survivors travel to the place or direction in which this big evil thing came from???,1388880000,,843,4.569536423841059

5833146,5,B00DMEC0WW,"I normally don't do reviews.  Usually have better ways to spend my time.  However, after seeing the multitude of negative reviews, I just had to add my two cents.

Spoiler alert - don't continue reading if you haven't seen it yet!  Suffice to say, it is worth watching!

This movie is essentially a combination of end-of-the-world apocalyptic Sci-Fi combined with an alternate explanation/origin for vampires.  And, regardless of what other reviewers say, the concept is very realistic.  (For those who don't think extreme hunger can alter people, try going a significant length of time without food.  Also, there is scientific evidence that some people become extremely violent and lose almost all rationality when faced with extreme hunger and fighting for survival.  Furthermore, there is scientific evidence that suggests cannibalism results in several side-effects such as madness.)

Character development is one weak point, but still acceptable enough to enjoy the movie and not nearly as bad as some reviews make it seem.

Other reviewers complain about a lack of ""background"" or explanation about the earth's current condition.  This is nonsense.  If one pays attention to details it is very obvious how the earth became the way it is, and expanding on it would add unnecessary length to the movie.  Its just not laid out in easy, obvious terms that some people apparently like.  But then, many people don't like to think as much as they used to either.

There are other minor holes in the film... and the ""evil creatures"" seem inordinately resilient, but it is still a very enjoyable film.  My expectations were low, and it exceeded them by quite a bit.  It also had legitimately creepy/suspenseful moments (created almost purely by story-telling), which I find hard to come by in films today.",1386806400,2,1802,5.092150170648464

Does extreme hunger make people go bananas and get on their haunches like a hyena and howl? Are the Mad Max outfits necessary? This movie is not well researched. Sort of stupid, actually.

And what's up with Lawrence Fishburne's eyebrows? Is he transitioning?

That's it.",1386374400,,564,4.63
5833149,3,B00DMEC0WW,This was a surprise. The acting was really solid and so was the story. It was a great example of humans trying to survive and the complexities that a rise as a result.

5833151,3,B00DMEC0WW,"I just rented ""The Colony"" from Redbox and watched it. It helps if you like apocalyptic thrillers, and I surely do. It is probably my favorite sci-fi genre, that and zombie flicks. The basic premise of the movie is: mankind pumped too much carbon and fossil fuel emissions into the atmosphere and had to create satellite stations all over the world to control the environment. Something happened to the planet and one day it started to snow. The world became one big arctic zone. Somewhere in the world there is a storehouse, a vault of seeds, just in cast there is some real global disaster---- this is a real place!! It it is there that one last band of humans remain. Various undefined flu epidemics are killing those that are left. If you come down with the flu virus, you are checked for it, and if you have the virus you either go for a walk--- to die in the snow, or Bill Paxton loses his patience and humanity and shoots you. The rescue party that went to Outpost 5 consisted of: Laurence Fishbourne, some guy named Sam and a boy. The set off to Outpost 5 because they got a distress signal. At Outpost 5 they find crazed humans who have gone feral or wild. The ""crazies"" have become cannibals. People to the cannibals are nothing but food. The boy is killed by the cannibals and Sam and Fishbourne barely escape Outpost 5. Fishbourne gives his life killing cannibals when he blows up a bridge. Sam makes it back to the outpost but has led the wild feral humans to the seed bank. As the cannibals show up all hell breaks lose. Bill Paxton dies but before he does he shoots an lp tank taking many crazies with him. Sam escapes and the survivors of Outpost 5 head for the one warm zone that they heard about when they visited the other station. At Outpost 5 Fishbourne and the two others saw a broadcast from one satellite that was reactivated. At that zone there is heat, the permafrost has melted, so the seeds can go in the ground there. Also, the sun is shining in that one zone. So at the end of the movie the survivors are going to WALK to that Nirvana.

There are many flaws in the logic of this movie. At Outpost 7 nobody does much of anything to limit their contact with others. Anyone could have the flu but nobody wears gloves. Everybody touches everything and each other. Our young hero in the movie was making out with one girl. They may even have had sex. But nothing is sterilized. Quarantine is the same room or rooms for all who get sick. After a sick person is shot they drag the body away, TOUCHING it, prior to burial in the snow. And just how do the heat Outpost 7? Also, I never saw the stores of food the people were eating. I know they have the seed vault but what indeed are these survivors eating? And it's not very believable how the rescue party trekked across the country in the sub zero temperatures to help those at Outpost 5. The rescue group spent the night in an abandoned helicopter. They seemed to be quite warm and content. In truth they would have been as cold inside as they had been outside. All the copter did was to break some of the wind. And if it is snowing all the time why wasn't this helicopter buried by the relentless snow? This helicopter had been used as a refuge in the past so why is it not now buried in the snow?

This movie steals ideas from at least a few movies: ""The Day After Tomorrow""-----where the gloabal climate grew cold, ""The Road""---cannibalism, ""The Thing""----sickness in a very cold lonely outpost, etc. This isn't quite a classic due to a low budget and weak script but it is still nonetheless a dramatic if dumb thriller. The ending did not leave me enthusiastic for the survivors of outpost 7. In all honestly I'd have to think the survivors would have all frozen to death trying to get to the warm zone. The survivors barely made it to the surface with the clothes on their backs but we are to believe that a pillowcase full of seed jars will save them all. Also,  apparently cannibals gain super strength and endurance from eating human flesh. The crazies/cannibals don't tire and they seem to be amazing savage warriors. Fishbourne claimed it was humans going feral and driven insane by hunger. I know people become bastards over the littlest things but since when did hunger and a diet of human flesh and bone turn wild humans into something like ravenous wolves on steroids? But what the hey, the movie was entertaining. It was well worth the dollar that I paid to rent it, and I might buy a copy sometime at the flea market, if I can get a good deal on it.",1385856000,2,4541,4.390736342042755

Of corse there was action and killing and plenty of cannibalism - but in the end, the last of the good guys made it out safely and the film fades to black as they trudge, knee-deep in snow towards the potential of a better fate.  I'd certainly watch this for free on Netflix or Amazon Prime Video, but I wouldn't pay for it again as a rental or as a film to own.",1385683200,,886,4.630573248407643

5833156,2,B00DMEC0WW,"Having two well known actors in the lead of ""The Colony"" doesn't save it from mediocrity. ""The Colony"" mixes elements from other films into an appealing looking B movie with little ambition or much in the way of character or plot. The film lacks memorable, well developed characters or anything resembling an original plot which puts it in the same category as an original movie you might see on the SyFy channel except lacking the goofiness or outrageous quality of those TV movies.

SPOILERS:

The most notable thing about ""The Colony"" are the CG visual effects (quite good), Bill Paxton (""Aliens"", ""Near Dark"") and Laurence Fishburne (""The Matrix"", ""Man of Steel"") play members of a colony isolated and living underground in a world of perpetual winter. When their colony loses contact with another one, Briggs (Fishburne) leads a team to discover what's happened. They find that the other colony has been infiltrated by cannibals.

END OF SPOILERS:

So why the 2 stars? Although ""The Colony"" is derivaitive and isn't all that well written, Fishburne, Paxton and the group of supporting actors do a good job with what they are given and the use of CG/make up is impressive.

The single special feature is a 10 minute featurette on the film ""The Colony: Behind the Scenes"" although you do also get a trio of trailers that play before the film (I don't consider those special features myself. They do include the trailer for the superior ""The Numbers Station"".

The direction and performances aren't the problem with ""The Colony"". The cliched script is the problem. Offering nothing fresh and lacking strong character development, ""The Colony"" comes across as a nice looking b-movie. The image quality (for those interested) is quite good for the DVD and audio is exceptionally good as well but these technical attributes don't save a script that has nothing new to offer.",1385510400,2,1873,4.968051118210862

There were only about 25 cannibals at that point. How did the cannibals get around the bridge so fast? There should only have been about 18 cannibals left at that point after the bomb. How did they manage to get into colony 7? After they got in, how is it that a group of 18 or so odd people armed only with knives and short swords managed to defeat a group of 7-9 people with guns?

It seems we've come full circle as to our planet's future climatological state. In the '70s, doomsaying alarmists warned of an imminent new Ice Age. Crappy sci-fiers like 1979's QUINTET (with Paul Newman) took advantage of these non-news stories. Then along came Al Gore in the '90s with his Global Warming syncophants. Seems the pendulum has swung the other way again, and a frozen planet where it never stops snowing is our bleak setting.

Everyone who's still alive is now underground in specially constructed shelters. At Colony 7, the few remaining of previous hundreds maintain a stock of seeds and hope for better days, even though they're plagued by a deadly flu-like virus. Everything changes for the worse when they receive an SOS from a nearby colony and three men, including leader (Laurence Fishburne), head out to investigate. Meanwhile, in the absence of their top man, gun happy Bill Paxton makes a power grab.

Our intrepid rescuers endure agonizing cold and storm conditions to reach Colony 5. They find no live inhabitants. The place has been overrun by cannibalistic feral sub-humans. The youngest of the three is killed in an attempt to escape being monster lunch. The other two head for home but are followed by the bloodthirsty freaks.

Look, I thought it was going to be pretty mediocre, which I could live with, since the post-apocalyptic premise is generally something I like, so I'm willing to sit through some pretty lame movies. Things were solidly ""meh"", with underdeveloped, one dimensional characters, but then, it got HORRIBLE when they tried to fill the void left by the missing plot with tons or gore and random violence for some shock value.

5833178,2,B00DMEC0WW,"Quite frankly, I was suckered in by the Fishburn, Patton & Zeggers.  This is not worth reviewing but I did spend a few bucks on it and because it didn't pan out - I'm reviewing it.

The good actors weren't enough to turn this project into a great movie. Something was just missing.  Filming in the snow in Canada can't be that hard.  The special effects were just ok for a TV movie.  The story was recycled.  I can see that they were going for something different but not totally outlandish but the plot just didn't carry the story.  The direction appeared to just be ok.  It was almost like some people in Canada said to themselves, ""what do we have around here? a few tin sheds, some warehouses, some junk, some old clothes, a few jackets, some chemistry equipment, a vampire makeup set, some ketchup, snow, more snow, some hydroponic equipment, some old rifles.....ok, DONE, let's make a movie!!  Can we get Fishburn?""

Basically, this was a B movie all the way around bordering on C.

That said, B movies have come a long way from the garbage sci fi that used to be out there. This is not one of those syfy made for TV movies but it's quite frankly not that much better.

It's quite interesting to see that at least in the realm of sci fi, a great actor does not a great movie make.  You need so many things to come together to make a great movie. It's like having a Ferrari stuck on a boat.....Looks pretty but without a track, beautiful mountain road or picturesque city to drive through -- it's not much more than expensive ballast.

My advice, watch it in 10 years at 2am on syfy on a Friday night when you can't sleep.",1383264000,2,1627,4.344370860927152

I mean, I've sat through a few recent overly hyped bjg star budget busters, but none had the raw and gritty  look and feel of ""The Colony.""

A snow and ice covered atmosphere opens the film. A small band of survivors led by Lawrence Fishburne and leader ""wannabe"" Bill Paxton receive radio contact from another colony which prompts a search into a thrill building barren wasteland. The search is a unique near end of the world vision that offers formula driven turned fresh ideas. What IS the unknown? Well, not zombies again thankfully, but a devolved band of humanoids that easily jolt the senses. Kevin Zegers from 2004s Dawn Of The Dead fame is teamed with Fishburne keeping a fresh face of fear that bodes well for the action. Paxton, as the self assumed leader is not on his game however. He's a good actor but in this case doesn't portray the  rough leader role well. He's passable but adds a lull to the film at times.

Charlotte Sullivan who I don't know much about plays Zegers girlfriend and well needed eye candy in a grim and hopeless world. She handles the role perfectly. ""The Colony"" was worth buying for me. The blu ray is incredibly sharp with awesome imagery. A few holes such as Zeglers face being intact after a wicked beating annoyed me but all in all, for the genre, this is sci fi time well spent.",1383091200,,1478,4.483271375464684

It is actually a fact that if it continues to heat up , it will eventually start to snow out of control and a ice age will return. This one was caused by humans using weather machines but it's still a good idea.  The story is very simple , and it in no way features zombies. In fact cannibals attack and eat people in some awful ways. The movie , I saw was unrated so you see them cutting arms off to eat people and such.  Bill Paxton plays a out of control chief of security of one colony. Lawrence Fishbourne plays the heroic leader of the same colony.  Three of them set off to find out what happened to another colony and meet up with some nasty cannibals. The cannibals chase them back to their colony.  At that point , they get in through the vents, This film has a smaller budget than you would think by looking at it.  It is not a bad film, nor is it a great one, it's a good flick about the end of the world though. It isn't good on a character level as everyone just fights cannibals basically.  That makes for a very fast adventure film that is shallow character wise. I love slow character driven movies too, but a quick paced action flick about fighting cannibals in a frozen world is entertaining too.

The preview of The Colony was well done, the movie takes place during the second ice age. The movie started off good, I luv movies when the characters are isolated causing for a more scary effect. I will admit if Laurence Fishburne and Will Paxton were not in this movie it would have totally bombed!

Fishburne and two colonist take a trip through the snowy terrain to assist another colony after they have recevied a SOS. After getting there they quickly discover that the bunker is filled with canibals.

I will have to agree with another review, this movie was very similar to 30 Days Of Night which was a better movie. However, this movie didn't provide enough action and the storyline was to vauge.  Once Fishburne's charater dies the movie seemed to rush to the end.

5833214,2,B00DMEC0WW,"The Colony(released April/13)stars,among others,Laurence Fishburne as Briggs,Kevin Zegers as Sam,Bill Paxton as Mason and Charlotte Sullivan as Kai. This film is yet another Armageddon film,trying to throw the guilts at each and every viewer for its subject matter and totally failing at its attempt to create any kind of excitement.
The story opens with two people getting attacked by an unseen force,down the end of a long corridor filled with huge pipes. Next we are introduced to the movies home base,Colony 7. This is the not too distant future and man's clumsy attempts at altering climate have fouled it completely. It is now a world of endless winters and everyone who survives,lives underground. Briggs is the one in charge of this colony and he has trouble with Mason,who was put in charge of taking care of the sick. Past protocol was to put people who came down with a simple cold,into quarantine then test them after. If they passed they were allowed back amongst the colony. If not they were given the option of ""walking""(walking outside and away) or being shot. It seems Mason is shooting first and asking questions well afterwards.
Amidst this turmoil comes a distress call from Colony 5. Three leave to investigate,which includes Sam,Briggs and a young man who volunteers. They arrive the next day to find blood everywhere. We realize the opening of the film took place here. Inside they find one survivor who doesn't want to leave. They glean some important intel however on another colony elsewhere that has managed to turn on some old weather control equipment and has melted the snow and has sunshine. They also stumble upon a large group of colonist still alive who are now living off human flesh,and filing their teeth with bones so they are small and pointed. What follows is a struggle to get out in one piece. Briggs and Sam make it but their young companion doesn't. They flee as fast as they can but are followed. During an attempt to blow up a section of a long bridge,Briggs ends up sacrificing himself to save Sam and the Colony.
Sam barely makes it back alive and is handcuffed by Mason who doesn't believe his story. Soon the group from Colony 5 arrives and starts its bid to take over Colony 7. When all is said and done just a mere handful make it out of the Colony through its vents,and leave to search for the colony with sun. Fade to black.
This is a movie on how not to make one. The superfluous shots and editing are amateurish. For example there is a scene where Briggs and Sam are in a helicopter for the night while fleeing the horde from Colony 5. They say what they have to,they're all set to head out tomorrow and what should have been a cut to next day,turns into yet another shot from outside the helicopter THEN them going to the next day. We know they're in the helicopter,so there was no need to reinforce it with a fading shot. This was as superfluous as it comes. Another example is Sam who battles the Colony 5 leader. Up to now the leader has killed everyone he has come in contact with,yet now Sam somehow manages to defeat him. Anyways,after he does there is a shot of Sam walking towards a fiery background to leave. We cut to the small group of those who managed to escape above,thinking Sam is about to emerge also. No. We then cut to yet another shot of Sam walking towards flames,THEN he soon after emerges from the vent shaft like the others.
Besides excess shots and poor editing,the story is a terribly slow sucker;sucker being the operative word as it sucks any enthusiasm for this film right out of you. Its pace is as slow and relentless as the weather the characters have to endure. The ending totally catches you off guard as you're expecting to follow the colonists to the new one with the sunshine. Truth be told,it wouldn't/couldn't have helped this movie in any way.
Technically speaking the film is in its original a/r of 2:35:1 and s clear and crisp. There is one featurette....if you care.
All in all a complete waste of a good cast with a sub par script,editor and director.

So humanity being resistant, build underground complex ""colonies"" for humanity to survive. Over the years, dwindling supplies and disease are rampant. Other colonies exist and one sends out a distress call for help and a few brave souls set forth to help their fellow man. I won't spoil it any further than this; it's rather predictable with how things pan out. This film is rather short as well at just about 1 hour 28 minutes in length. There is definitely more that could have been added but I feel things were cut too short and left you with a lackluster ending with no real satisfaction or hope.

I'd wait till it's less than $9 for a rental as is it's when I have watched it. If you have some downtime and don't have high expectations then give this flick a whirl.

The movie fails to deliver any significant message and it is not entertaining either,bad combination,recipe for a fluke,this type of result is expected from a B-movie,not one with Lawrence Fisburne and Bill Paxton in the cast.",1379289600,,294,5.276595744680851
5833221,1,B00DMEC0WW,"Good actors and good idea (who doesn't like a good end of the world survival movie?)but its still a terrible movie. This movie has no original ideas and there is an annoying crazy ex-military guy who adds nothing to this movie except exasperation. If you get frustrated by idiots who are deliberately placed in a movie to hinder a groups survival and create ""drama"", then you will be aggravated throughout this movie. Oh and I will save you some trouble... there isn't really any resolution to this movie. Don't waste your time.",1378944000,3,528,4.75

Spam, scam fishing bs site. They advertise top movies for free. They get your info and then you get to choose from about 40 b rate russian and spanish movies. What a deal.

5833223,3,B00DMEC0WW,"We love anything to do with end of the world, apocalypse/survival so let that override our better judgement and we ignored all the reviews that said to wait for this to come out on dvd and not spend money on it.  This wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't that good either and definitely not one that is worth full pre-dvd price.  The acting was pretty weak or overdone in parts and the story didn't seem like it was very developed or finished. You are left at the end wondering what happened to the people.",1378598400,9,503,4.28421052631579

5833225,5,B00DMEC0WW,"Its one of those well done fast moving stories that develops very well under Lawrence Fishburn's experienced hand. Food being scarce, in a world set in dystopia future after man had utterly destroyed the envirornment, some humans developed a taste for human flesh... easy way out, till even that food source runs out.

Great movie. I'd watch again.",1378339200,2,348,5.0
5833226,3,B00DMEC0WW,"The movie is good, with good set, plot and cast.  Trouble is the vilians are too flat, or simply canables that seem to be both insane and superhuman running through a attic blizzard at night when normal people are held up to prevent freezing to-death.  The ultimate ending was also sudden and unsatisfying leaving the survivors to walk into the artic waist.",1377907200,,357,4.741935483870968
5833227,5,B00DMEC0WW,"Written and directed by Jeff Renfroe, 'The Colony' is a post-apocalyptic action-packed thriller filmed inside the former NORAD base. Filmed with many similarities to 'The Thing' and 'The Day After Tomorrow', 'The Colony' is an enjoyable sci-fi action film.

In what is claimed as the next ice age, the survivors are forced underground; struggling with plague like flu they form a colony in an underground bunker. Led by a firm but fair leader, Briggs (Fishburne) enforces the rules as they were passed down. Throw into the mix an antagonist, as a sub-plot Mason (Paxton) has his own plans of how the colony should be run.

The colony forms an alliance with surrounding outposts, on receiving a mayday call a search team is sent to Outpost 5 to check on them. After a day and half's journey in zero temperatures the trio arrive at Outpost 5 to find a threat more terrifying than death by freezing - a ravenous band of flesh tearing cannibals. Who hack and slash their way through colonies in hours. After the failed rescue attempt our main hero Sam (Zegers) makes his way back to the colony with the remainder of the savage posse on his tail - looking to finish the job.

5833228,1,B00DMEC0WW,"This movie showed promise with great actors of Fishburn and Paxton, but went no where.  I thought it was a human survival Scifi movie and it ended up being a very stupid horror (not even scary, horror) film.

5833229,2,B00DMEC0WW,"This movie was bad, they built it up for Lawrence Fishburne being the main driving character. But he's really not even a presence after the first act. None of the other character really have any time to develop or add anything to this movie. It felt like a unsuccessful version of the marauders from Firefly.

Overall the story didn't really make sense or do anything particularly interesting.",1377561600,3,393,4.865671641791045

Its a good movie. Just don't expect a lot more than that you'll be fine. It really is worth watching! I really enjoyed it.

Also Charlotte Sullivan who played Gail Peck on Rookie Blue, and was also in Chicago Fire, Caught, and Radius is in this as the character ""Kai"". Always liked her, so that was a nice surprise. :)",1509062400,,479,4.841463414634147
