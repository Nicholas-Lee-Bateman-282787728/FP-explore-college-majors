8190487,3,B000PC6ENK,"Lots of good action, but poor quality video and lots of weird angles.  Still worth watching though.",1408060800,,99,4.823529411764706
8190488,5,B000PC6ENK,"I was pretty disappointed with Vol. 1 (poor image quality mainly), but they hit the mark with Vol. 2 ""Kiwi Camo""--beautifully filmed, great music, and more fish porn than you can stand. The guys get some huge browns in the land where ""Lord of the Rings"" was filmed. Excellent entertainment.",1335744000,,290,4.82
8190489,5,B000PC6ENK,"My husband loves the Trout Bum Diaries.  Each adventure gives him ideas for his own adventures.  The ""Trout Bums"" go to some really amazing places.  Great DVD.",1264809600,,159,4.814814814814815
8190490,5,B000PC6ENK,I have enjoyed fly fishing my whole life and The Trout Bums have given me a new look at what I need to do.  Quit my job and start traveling the world and fly fishing.  The photography in the second video is second to none.  They are true fly fishing bums.  I have fly fished all over the state of Alaska and they opened up a whole new area of fishing to me that I have not yet witnessed.  They can fish my secret holes any day,1193443200,2,426,3.8505747126436782
