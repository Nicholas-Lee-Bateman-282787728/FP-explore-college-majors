My Father Loves this movie (latter) and I thought ""Maui"" would be somehow different but they are the same movie.
BTW, VHS doesn't hold up very well after 20 years (dispite the seller claiming it was ""Like New"").
Nice cover on the box -almost worth the cost of the purchase!",1345161600,,341,4.34375
7820489,2,6302060842,"A harmless romantic movie with a touch of comedy. Nothing really spectacular but catching the flair of the late 70's, beginning 80's in a most delightful way. Watch the clothes, specifically Ricci Martin's white trousers. To be honest, there could have been more of everything, but I doubt if the movie would have been the same again. Anyway, the best is the music by England Dan & John Ford Coley. The soundtrack to the film was their final cooperation. I have been loving this for more than 30 years now.
