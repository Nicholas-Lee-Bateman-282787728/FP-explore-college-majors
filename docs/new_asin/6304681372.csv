913340,5,6304681372,"So often, films of stage productions have a tendency to throw in special effects and odd cuts and jumps to - supposedly - make the film more enjoyable (take the new ""Cats"" for example...). This is just a  perfectly re-created musical. The actors shine, the voices and music are  magnificent, and the story is clever, fun and insightful.  EVERYONE would  love this!!!",912988800,,366,4.854838709677419
913341,5,6304681372,"The whole cast shines in my most favorite Sondheim musical!  The music and lyrics are brilliant and you'll love all the fairy tale stories that are magically interwoven.

This is a beautifully shot recording of the live Broadway production.  My only complaint is that the scene selection is in odd places.  For instance, I would like to be able to skip the wolf's number and go right to the next scene, but it instead skips to halfway through the following scene.  Other than that, I can absolutely recommend this DVD.",1513123200,,457,4.675

913544,5,6304681372,"This is my personal favorite. Watch the original broadway cast in all their glory. Pam Winslow (Rapunzel) and Chuck Wagner (Rapunzel's prince) are captivating performers. Kim Crosby (Cinderella) and Robert Westenberg (Cinderella's prince) are now married in real life... which is adorable.

Can't watch it enough.",1501200000,,313,5.804347826086956
913545,5,6304681372,"Hollywood has an unpleasant habit of making okay adaptations of far superior works (Sweeny Todd, for instance), and Into the Woods is no exception. While the recent version is okay, certainly not the worst interpretation, it pales when compared to this earlier work.

As is often the case, the acting in the stage production has more personality than its cinematic counterpart- but what really stands in contrast with ""Into the Woods"" is its content. The Hollywood version has the disadvantage of having to be edited for the movie theater, adjusted to fit notions of what's a reasonable run time, and maximizing appeal.

You'll avoid that kind of butchery in this version. Here you'll get the grand experience with an exceptional cast of characters, explored with more depth than a Hollywood take allowed.",1500336000,4,805,5.090909090909091
913546,5,6304681372,"I saw the play today - 7/2/17 - and really enjoyed it. I think the idea for the play is very clever and the music was very nice. It made my afternoon great. The play is broken into act one and two. In act one, the authors combined into a single episode the fairy tales of Jack and the Bean stalk, Little Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel, the Baker and his wife vs. a witch, and Cinderella, indicating that they all occurred in one place at one time. The play has a narrator who in the version I saw, narrates/explains some events and plays a mysterious stranger who complicates events sometimes. By combining the events, the authors give us new insights into the famed fairy tales.
In act two, after all the events were settled, and the tale states that the people lived happily ever after, the act tells us that life is not this way at all. Cinderella, for example, may have married the prince, but her husband like many princes, slept with other women. Jack may have killed the giant, but the giant had a wife who was seeking revenge. Furthermore, acts like Jacks in killing a person can affect the entire community. Many people die as a result of his murder. Act two reminds us that fairy tales are not real. But, more than that, there was a wealth of humor, the singing was delightful, and the story was both interesting and quite thought provoking.",1498953600,,1346,4.4534412955465585

913608,5,6304681372,"Not quite two years ago, sometime after the Disney movie adaptation of this play was released on DVD, I rented it and watched it with my family. I have always loved fairy tales and Disney's happy adaptations of fairy tales, while also being intrigued by the darker original tales; so of course I wanted to see Into The Woods. Disney dropped the ball on this one and I'm glad I didn't buy it, only rented it. They didn't give Into The Woods the usual sugar-coated Disney makeover - which would've been OK if they hadn't completely overreached in their attempt to preserve the darker overtones of the original play. (They also failed to edit the 2 hour 30 minute play down to a 2 hour movie with a story that still WORKS). All this resulted in a product that is simply weird, creepy, and doesn't make sense. Something about the story got under my skin, however, and I came away from the movie feeling like ""I'm glad I saw it, even though I did not love it"". Fast forward nearly two years; the disappointing experience of the promising concept was still nagging at me, so I purchased and watched this version of the story after reading all the positive reviews. So glad I did! Finally, gaping plot holes were filled, AND I was able, emotionally and thoughtfully, to experience the story as it was meant to be experienced. The MOVIE makes you feel ambivalent and uneasy about its characters. Not so with the play. All the actors did a wonderful job and gave heartfelt, compassionate performances. None of the characters were wholly good or bad, just human and relatable. They are portrayed with genuine pathos. Also, the thought-provoking (and fully intact) lyrics actually make sense when they're sung in this version. Of course, Bernadette Peters steals every scene she's in, but I also very much enjoyed the marvelous performances of the actors who portrayed the Baker, his Wife, Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood and... well, the whole cast, really. The play is actually more family-friendly than the movie, too, even though the Baker's Wife and Cinderella's Prince are seen rolling across the forest floor in an embrace and the Wolf's costume seems to be anatomically correct (most kids probably won't know or care, it's noticeable only briefly). The point is that in the play the adult content is portrayed much more subtly and open to interpretation - an interpretation a child wouldn't make. As for the music, I will refrain from comparing the singing in the two productions; to compare the pop style of the movie and the Broadway style of the play would be a useless 'apples and oranges' argument. At any rate, this play is definitely worth the $8.99 and the 2 1/2 hours; I am glad I saw it AND love it. I hope you love it, too.",1489449600,,2734,4.686070686070686

The masterful comedy of ""Agony"",  the heartwrenching performance of ""Stay"", the beauty of such songs as ""Giants in the Sky"", ""Last Midnight"" and ""Children Will Listen"" will only keep the audience coming back for more thanks to the all star cast of the original Broadway production.  The play is an absolute delight to watch.

Recently there was a re-make, and sometimes musical theatre remakes can be a beautiful thing (for example, the remake of Phantom of the Opera, or Sweeney Todd), however in the case of Stephen Sondheim's ""Into the Woods"", the original is and always will be the very best version.  Something is just ""lost"" in the remake.  This is an extremely long stage musical, presented in original stage format as was originally broadcast on PBS.  The music is beautiful and catchy, especially the incredibly talented Bernadette Peters in her performance of ""The Last Midnight"".  If you enjoy fairy tales, musicals, and theater, then you have probably already seen this gem - but if you haven't, you would be remiss not to give it a watch.

914030,4,6304681372,"Warning: this is not the recent movie. If you're looking for that, and only that, this will not be a good substitute. This is a filming of the play during its 1985 revival.

Second warning: THIS PLAY HAS MATURE CONTENT. Because the movie was disneyfied, people seem to believe this play must be family friendly. There are deaths. There is implied violence. There are many sex jokes. There are themes about the nature of storytelling and moral ambiguity and infidelity and being discontent even when you get your deepest desires. This is an adult play, and it uses the Grimm version of fairy tales, not disney. If you're comfortable with your children watching this, I'd also like to add that I doubt it could keep their attention for its full two and a half hour run time. It is not colorful or joyous and the humor is, for the most part, very dry.

Warning three: there is a second act. However resolved everything is at the end of the first, keep going. It will seem like it's over. It's not.

Caveat emptors out of the way, man, I love this play. It's funny, it's smart, it's heartbreaking and optimistic and cynical all at once. I believe this is easily Sondhiem's best work, in terms of concept and structure. Musically, many of the songs are technically impressive, but forgettable, with a couple of exceptions (Agony and its reprise, Last Midnight, Hello Little Girl.)

As I mentioned, the humor is very dry, but the delivery of the actors sells it. Joanna Gleeson is the standout performance, with her clever expressions and sly smirks that speak to her determination and intelligence long before the play shows this.

If you like musicals, this is a classic and high school favorite for a reason. But don't expect the same distilled, septic performances of the movie, which pulls its punches during the reversal portion of the play and comes across limp but pretty.

I'm taking a star off for quality. It looks and sounds like they used a potato to record the play.",1462406400,6,1974,4.674351585014409

914643,5,6304681372,"I saw the movie version with Meryl Streep first - a rental, and fell in love with this beautiful story. But had a craving to see the Bernadette Peters version as soon as I found out more about the history of this play. Written as a Broadway play, this one, with Mrs. Peters, really is worth watching/owning. The actors are amazing, and so life-like, and their knowledge of the character portrayals are clearly seen. This is not a movie production. My only question, why bother making a Blu-Ray version, since the sound is sub-par and the video not the best (in the sense, its not even wide screen). There are lots of moments when singing is off key. But this is a live recording, with an audience. You need to use a different scale to draw opinions of a live performance, verses a movie production. Frankly, both the Broadway and movie produced versions are worth having.",1442361600,7,871,4.589743589743589

914647,5,6304681372,"Giants in the sky is a tune I remember from when I was 8 years old. The hype train from the Hollywood Film got people interested again, but they clearly cast people on their looks rather than their singing ability. Anna Kendrick and Meryl Streep performed admirably, but the rest left me begging for Joanna Gleason, Bernadette Peters, and Chip Zein.  With Sondheim, its more about the lyrics and music and you're ability to deliver the message.  While this filming could have been geared better toward a home audience, the key points hit.  I love this play, and this recording serves as the best example of what the play once was on broadway.

It's a staged version, with a narrator telling the story as it progresses, and eventually becoming part of the story itself - to his dismay.

915402,1,6304681372,"The movie 'into the woods' involved one of my favorite actresses, Meryl Streep and a childhood crush Johnny Depp. I am disgusted they chose to perform in this movie. I waited a while to finally watch it and am greatly disappointed at the racist s*** in the movie, both subtle and overt. Their cameras zeroed in on the black extras in the background because they know they had no meaningful roles for *any* minorities in the movie and it was totally unnecessary to make the movie racially segregated since it was fantasy, not based on real people.

An example of overt racism is when red ridinghood wanders off into the 'the wrong side of the woods' (aka the black neighborhood) and comes across a wolf in a Zoot Suit. In case you aren't aware of the history, Zoot Suits were the hoodies and track suits of their time. Black and Chicano people who wore those suits were targeted by white people and police trying to assert their white dominance. Zoot suits were less innocuous than a hoody because they were symbolic of brown and black power of minorities like black, Italian and latin Groups where hoodies are just hoodies and typically don't mean anything. Yes, there was murder (by white people against non white people) and yes it was as ridiculously unjust as the Trayvon Martin case. I'm in disbelief that they actually made this racist garbage in 2014!?

The movie 'Into the woods' should be thrown into the Trash as it's segregationist racist garbage. The character of little red riding hood should be rewritten as a black boy wearing a red hoody similar to Trayvon Martin. This leading character would wander into the wrong part of the woods.. No, not the black neighborhood but the white ghetto. Ghetto doesn't have too mean poor, but it does mean segregated. The wolf in the zoot suit should be rewritten so that it's a racist white man in a police suit, a wolf in sheeps clothing, you know, like George Zimmerman. I'm so tired of the 'helpless white girl' theme and the cultural projection. The movie was racist and they are counting on young people to not know the history of the zoot suit, but they AINT getting this s***e past me.",1431907200,,2144,4.639473684210526

The performances are iconic, the staging is brilliant, and the musical itself is one of my favorites.

The video quality of the Blu-Ray, unfortunately, is not as awesome as it could be. The color correction is a bit off, the resolution is not great, and the final result looks about as grainy as that VHS version taped off PBS.

I love how complete this is. While I loved the new Disney movie as well, I feel like the songs it cut due to length and subject matter weakened some of the character motivations. Some of the transitions in the movie seemed a little abrupt, but in this full version, you see the struggles in their thought processes and how they ended up on a certain decision. I love the completeness of it.

We love this show, it's a great cast with wonderful dialog and music. The movie was pretty faithful to this original version, but lot of good stuff was cut including the second ""Agony"" song. The play does a lot better job of clarifying what happens to the characters. If you liked the movie, you'll probably like the play even better.

However, as good as the play was, this DVD is terrible. It looks like a third-generation VHS copy. We had another older version and that one was very clear. This copy's video is grainy and gets very jumpy when the camera pans horizontally. I'd recommend trying the Blu-ray version instead, maybe that one's better.",1428105600,4,778,4.671532846715328

It is so much better than the Disney movie. To begin, it is the entire story, not the watered down Hollywood white wash, which, although very good and quite lavish, leaves out the juiciest part of the tale.
This production has some very funny bits that are totally lost in the movie and much of the moral explanation is glossed over in the movie as well. The genius manipulation of the set throughout the play made scene transitions smooth and kept the plot moving along. I would love to see a more lavish live televised version of this happening. I can just imagine Bernadette Peters in fabulous gowns like Meryl Streep wore, although, she seems to be having so much fun I doubt if we would notice.

The story is the small, fairytale characters United by a baker and his wife needing objects from their story to break a curse.  I liked having the intermission because it turns much darker in act 2.

Bad therapy is so much worse than no therapy.  Captains Obvious Lapine/Sondheim selected their favorite crayons to create this childish crapfest.

Sondheims skills as a composer are undisputed.  He's had his hits and misses - there is a beauty to a bold failure.  So the surprise here is that it's a boring failure and not a bold one.

Lyrically we are in the terrain of 70's icon Carol Bayer Sager (""Just for today/ I'll be my feelings"").  Intellectually we're in the realm of Rod McKeun asking that we ""Listen to the Warm"".  You just want to roll up a newspaper and say bad Sondheim!  Bad Sondheim!

I suggest a chasers of ASSASSINS.  After all that sappy sugar you're going to need a bloody main course.",1426636800,2,855,4.516339869281046

The interwoven fairy tales of Little Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel, Cinderella, and Jack and the Beanstalk are closer to the original stories than to the versions we all know, and that darker edge lends itself beautifully to an underlying commentary on human nature.

If you are browsing movie using the Amazon Instant app you don't get the year, which would have tipped me off that this wasn't the right movie. I've seen other reviews and this has happened to a lot of other people, and it's probably the only reason why this movie made it to the top list on Amazon Instant. Of course, if you read in more details you see it's a old musical, but I'm used to trusting Amazon so I'm was not on the look out for tricks like this to confuse users. I guess I'll have to be more attentive from now on not to get tricked by Amazon again. I'm very surprised Amazon would allows this to happen, they are making a few bucks in exchange for eroding user's trust in the brand.",1425859200,,850,4.220858895705521
916504,5,6304681372,"I enjoy this movie thoroughly and feel like I must answer why and dispel the one star reviews.
-This is not the movie which hasn't even been released for home viewing as of now. Yes, it is a little fuzzy but take in account it was shot in 1991 and stop being so picky. The acting is phenomenal and the humor by nearly every character is at most times subtle, quick and witty.
-It's a musical, which I grew up on. The songs are fun and clever. My 11 year old sister plays the 14 minute ""Prologue"" over and over. ""Agony"" is hilarious and stole my heart with the line, ""Agony! Far more painful than yours!"" Both Jack's song and Little Red Riding Hood's are fun and really show growth in characters. ""Hello Little Girl"" is fun, catchy and uncomfortable all at once. ""There's no possible way to describe what you feel-- When you're talking to your meal!"" There are so many wonderful songs and yes, in true musical fashion that's most the movie.
-As for not for kids, I'll leave that up to you. It is a darker (albeit more traditional) take on the over-sweet disney tales we all know. There are uncomfortable topics (adultery, stealing, undertones of sexuality, infertility), most of those flew over my sister's head they are so subtle and addressed  in a very metaphorical way. I did answer questions  about the Baker's Wife and the Wolf, both which were uncomfortable to explain but we come from an open family. Over all, I think it really depends on how your house hold runs. My house, Pan's Labyrinth and Sweeney Todd are mixed in with The Lego Movie and The Princes and the Frog, also my sister is very mature and we always gauge how a movie is being received by the younger kids as we watch.
Over all, this a dark, funny, whimsical ride with fantastic music and characters just be weary with younger viewers.

The cast is amazing, the costumes are very detailed, and the stage set moves very well and are very well placed. And of course, how can we forget the songs?! Especially the Prologue in the beginning which sets the whole story! This production of 'Into the Woods' is comical, heart warming, and very fun to sing-along to. I was upset when it was later removed from Netflix upon the arrival of Disney's adaption, so I ordered the DVD on Amazon so I could watch it anytime. The Disney adaption was good visually, but cut at least 45 minutes of dialogue and a few musical numbers. But hey, it happens when you take a Broadway play and put it on a Hollywood sound stage.

I had completely forgotten about it until My Little Pony actually did a rendition of Ever After in their latest tv series and reminded me of this musical, and I'm glad it did. If you're familiar with Bernadette Peters, she hams it up as wonderfully as ever. My own mother couldn't even recognize her with all that makeup on. A bit of a dark comedy that has a liiiiitle bit of a conflicting theme, which probably won't make it good for kids depending on the maturity of the child, but it really is a great musical with a great message. Disney's rendition was a valiant effort with it's casting, directing, and effects, because this musical is a tough one to translate into movie form, but the live recording of this musical is the best way to go and I recommend it for any musical lover.",1424044800,,829,4.42483660130719

917250,5,6304681372,I have seen the new movie production of Into the Woods and loved it.  I bought this long before the movie came out and had never seen it so it was nice to know what was going on when the movie came out.  The price was so reasonable as well.,1424044800,,240,3.78
917251,4,6304681372,"The four stars is for the performances and the stage show. Here, we're talking the ORIGINAL Broadway Cast, including an extraordinary performance from Bernadette Peters. Here, we're also talking about a cast that had been performing the show for quite a while, and you see the looseness and chemistry in the performances. These performers are clearly having fun. They have the sort of chemistry that you only get with a live performance and with a cast that had been together for a while. Moreover, this performance was captured with a live audience at the theater, so you can also sense the chemistry with the audience with the cast feeding off the audience's energy, again something that only happens with a live performance.

There's no doubt that Anna Kendrick, Emily Blunt, and Meryl Streep hold their own in the film. None of the other actors, though, are up to what you see in the Broadway cast (and Johnny Depp was embarrassing, certainly compared to the actor portraying the wolf here). And Meryl Streep doesn't have the power in her singing voice to do the powerhouse ""Last Midnight"" the justice that someone like Bernadette Peters can bring to the song.

The original stage show is a smarter show than the movie. While the movie is a very, very good movie version of a stage show, it has been dumbed down a bit. The stage show was written for a knowing audience, and the book and its characters give a wink to knowing that these are stories and characters that are well-known. While this knowingness shows up in the film as well in the songs themselves (for example, during the opening song ""Into The Woods"" when Little Red Riding Hood sings about about going into the woods to visit grandmother, she sings ""As far as I know she, she's already dead"", it's an intentional bit of comedic irony. But that ironic element is largely played down in the Disney film in other areas, whereas the artifice of putting these characters' well-known stories on stage is called on and pointed out by almost all of the characters throughout the stage play, though not so much so that it becomes annoying. In the end, the stage musical is clearly aimed to bring out more of the wit of the show, and plays up to more of the intellect of the audience, as well as the heart. This performance of Into The Woods will have more surprises for you than the film.

Nothing can quite cure that this is not the most perfect, organic work of Sondheim. At times, the wordiness seems forced, in a way that the lyrics sometimes seems clever for cleverness' sake. Sweeney Todd, A Little Night Music, Sunday In The Park With George, Company -- they seem more organically grown, with the songs coming more truly from the characters and each moving the show more forward. There are certainly examples of that in Into The Woods such as ""Children Will Listen"", ""It Takes Two"", and the great ""No More"" (which was left off of the film version), but with the best Sondheim, you don't think ""How clever!"" while a song is being sung.

The downsides to the video and why only 4 stars? Well, for one, it IS stagey. You'll never get a sense that you ARE in a real dark forest. There's a dimensionality to the film which you just can't have in a video of a Broadway play. Secondly, this is a video which was captured on standard definition tape from 1989 (the video has a 1990 copyright, but I believe that this performance must have been done shortly before the show ended its run, one of the longest running of Sondheim's shows). There was no attempt to really do a whole lot of upgrading to the quality of the video. It's okay. I wish there had been an attempt to improve the quality. The quality isn't bad, but you'll see its age.

Most importantly, there are NO extras. Why not?! This is a release from late last year (2014), surely to take advantage of the Disney film's release. But I remember watching this when it first showed on PBS, recorded live as it happened. At intermission, there were interviews with the show's creators, Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine. Why not include them here? With this video, you only get the show itself, with an intermission card that last 20 seconds. You certainly could have interviewed current day Lapine and Sondheim today. Why not interview Joanna Gleason, or Chip Zien, or Chuck Wagner, or anyone else involved? Disappointing that this video seems more to have been dashed out to take advantage of the Disney film rather than to create a lasting document.

Still, this is a stunning production and will likely never be equaled. The cast performing in this video is having a blast, and so will you. Certainly if you want to see the original vision of the show, a superior one to the film, this is well worth springing for. And I paid $19 for it. I'm fine with that. As I write this, it's $11+. A no-brainer.",1423958400,,4820,4.598837209302325

917511,4,6304681372,"Into the Woods
 This film adaptation of a musical stage play earned three Academy Award nominations, including a nomination for best supporting actress for Meryl Streep, her 19th Oscar nomination.  Also in the cast are Johnny Depp as the wolf, Emily Blunt and Chris Pine.  Pine continues his career by surprising us again.  He can actually sing.  Anna Kindrick and Tracey Ulman also appear with young Lilia Crawford who stands out as Little Red Riding Hood.
 The story is musical miss mash of several well known fairy tales.  Jack and the beanstalk interacts with Little Red Riding Hood and Rapunzel.  Cinderella is side by side with the Baker and his Wife who need the help of the Witch to have a child.
 The thin yarn exists only for a backdrop of successive songs sung by the major players.  Fans of the musical form of film will enjoy it on that basis.  Bob Marshall (who directed the successful musical Chicago) directs from a screen play by James Lapine who adapted from the stage play by himself and Stephen Sondheim.
 This musical gets four saw blades.  It has a PG rating and lasts for two hours and four minutes. The big $50 million budget has returned a healthy $165 at the box office so far.
 This is the first film of her dozens in which Streep plays a witch.  Johnny Depp and director Marshall worked together on Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Shores.",1422835200,,1372,4.6115702479338845

The performance was sparkling, compared with the movie version, where the talent did not get any feedback from anybody except maybe the director when the sequence had finished filming. I am tempted to take off a star from the rating because the latter part of my download was replete with hesitations and stuttering so I actually could not finish seeing the performance, but if that happens to you, then just ask for your money back and you might get it.

918370,2,6304681372,"First, a clarification: I am reviewing the movie with Meryl Streep and a Johnny Depp cameo. I was tempted to give this movie a one star review, but my daughter liked it. The plot is thin and you had better like the broadway style of singing - lots of high-pitched notes, the traditional Broadway ""rhythm"", and over-emotive screaming passing as singing - or sitting through this movie will be painful. Nor could the lyrics redeem the music. (Apparently, repeating the same masculine word, for instance, ""now"" at the end of several lines counts as rhyming.) When my son announced he couldn't take it and had to have a break, about one-third of the way through, my daughter asked me to make  him come back, but I felt too guilty. I just let him walk out. Usually, I don't like to miss any part of a movie, but I drank soda without restraint and went to the restroom three times. Apparently, I didn't miss anything significant. Twice I got very excited because I thought the movie was ending only for it to continue still further. We did have fun mocking it on the way home. ""I wish I had not paid for that, now! I wish I had my money back, now! At least there was pop-C-O-R-N. POP-C-O-R-N!""",1420416000,,1187,4.470046082949309

918373,5,6304681372,"TL;DR: Buy the DVD version.

The musical itself is amazing. I highly recommend this over the recent movie because of how much was cut out from the stage version. The casting is perfect and the music is wonderful. I would not recommend this for younger viewers, but it is an absolute must watch for fans of musicals and/or theatre.

I recommend buying the DVD over the Blu-ray. It was filmed in a 4:3 ratio resulting in the left and right sections of the screen being left black. The video quality itself is lacking. It really is a direct conversion from an older format without trying to improve the quality any. The sound quality is decent. There are no bonus features. Also notable to point out on the menu screen of the Blu-ray, the  finale song plays. Which is fine but like many DVDs gets old quickly if you leave it on the menu screen for an extended amount of time.",1420416000,4,872,4.4375

THIS is the filmed play and I far, far and away prefer this version!!!!!  Much more humorous and with more depth to the characters.  There are storylines and songs here that were sadly cut from the film.  So very glad I was able to come home from seeing the movie and watch this instead.  This is for adults---life ISN'T a fairytale.  Sorry, Disney, but you (who make us all cut on teeth on happily ever afters) really weren't the best company to be making this into a movie.  You had princesses to protect in your version.  This one is a hoot with Rapunzel running around wailing and blaming her mother for screwing up her life, and the cheating princes are just priceless!

918647,4,6304681372,"I watched this musical because I wanted to see the movie. I'm someone who always reads the book before the movie, so I figured I better watch the original before I head to the theater. The first half of the musical is great! It includes Jack and the Beanstalk, Cinderella, Rapunzel, Red Riding Hood, Princes, a Witch and more. The music was catchy, but by the end it does wear on you. The acting was great, and the vocals were spot on. Of course since this is an older recording, so the picture quality isn't HD by any means. My kids also watched and as a family we laughed and thought it was entertaining. But after the typical intermission, the story does take a turn. This isn't a happily ever after musical, because the 2nd half grows dark and at times a bit boring. While the first half goes quickly, the second drags a lot. The 2nd half does include couples straying and unhappy endings, so most young children's attention will stray. (As it probably should) Overall, I did enjoy this musical. Does it compare to Wicked or Phantom? In my eyes no. Those songs are truly timeless, while Into the Woods has a few really good songs, they don't seem to last like other musicals.
I did go to the movie and actually enjoyed it more than this presentation. The movie was a bit too long, but I felt that the performances were great! If you haven't seen this musical or have an idea of what your going to watch in the theater you're going to get a rude awakening. My friends went with us and really disliked it and said it would have been better if it ended at the half way point. I am someone who appreciates musicals and so I can understand, but not all stories have a happy ending and I think that's the point of Into the Woods.",1420156800,,1727,4.333333333333333

It is raunchier since it is British, but absolutely phenomenal. There's an outdoor set, change of narrator, updated almost steampunk costuming, and incredible performances that you will lose yourself in. Yes, I love this PBS version.

919083,4,6304681372,"In anticipation of the new film version of ""Into the Woods"" I decided to take a look at this Tony winning stage production which used the original cast.  It was actually filmed for a television episode of American Playhouse that aired on March 15, 1991.  It is available on DVD and Blu ray.

The story by James Lapine, who also directs, blends together various fairy tale characters (Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel, Jack and others) into one story.  The nexus is the Baker (Chip Zien) and his Wife (Joanna Gleason) and their inability to conceive a child.  The local Witch (Bernadette Peters) agrees to reverse the Wife's ""condition"" but the couple must bring her 4 items.  A red Cloak, a gold shoe, a white cow and ""yellow as corn"" hair are her demands.  Somehow these items together would release the curse of the Witch's grotesque features.

Working with one basic stage, the production is pretty rudimentary but is buoyed by the music of the great Stephen Sondheim.  Peters is of course a terrific singer and gets many of the big number including the tearful ""Children Will Listen.""  I was also taken with Ms. Gleason's humorous take the Baker's wife.  She also has a fine singing voice.  I'm most familiar with her as a supporting actor in numerous films.

The rest of the actors are very good and have seasoned singing voices.  The costumes were pretty original.  I was a bit surprised to see the Wolf's (Robert Westenberg) costume to be anatomically correct below the belt.  This must be a little concerning for some, especially in the first scene where he confronts Little Red Riding Hood (Danielle Ferland).

The DVD is problematic.  The video is washed out and not very pretty to look at.  The editing and direction are pretty good however.  Audio is only available in stereo but it is fine.  The music is great, the story is interesting and the acting is top notch.  I highly recommend going for the Blu ray.",1419292800,2,1933,4.724550898203593

I was disappointed to learn and hear that the nice little stereo soundtrack on the DVD is presented in MONO on the blu-ray.  The picture is a little better than the DVD, and even seems to be taken from an earlier master (one that says ""American Playhouse"" at the beginning, as opposed to the title only of the DVD).  But the sound has been botched.  Image, you need to issue a recall.

As for the performance, the original Broadway cast is nearly perfect, and the staging is quite good.  That's the only reason I give this audio travesty 2 stars.",1418169600,8,624,4.4298245614035086

Sometimes musicals become boring because they seem to throw in some of the songs just because its a musical. This one isn't like that. The dialog and music are perfectly seamed together with not too much or too little of either. The one drawback is that you have to stay alert because you might miss bits and pieces that are integral to the story line.

919444,5,6304681372,"For years the only way I have been able to enjoy this musical is on CD. I am a big Sondheim fan, but live in the midwest where I've never had a chance to see it. I tried watching a DVD of it years back and couldn't get into it. But this! This is the closest I have gotten so far and I was not disappointed. Since I don't even know what an 'artifact' is in relation to blu-ray, I didn't notice any. On a 42"" screen it looked great and I was totally absorbed into the story, even though I already knew it. Being able to see the characters faces made a big difference. Since Disney is coming out with what I have read is a watered down version, I really wanted to see the 'original'. I can see why Disney wants to take some of it out - and Sondheim does too, from an interview I read on the internet. But it really is an adult reflection on not listening to the wisdom you've been taught and the consequences that can follow from straying from the path. So I will be interested to see how Disney balances this without ruining the experience.",1417651200,2,1038,4.0931372549019605

919449,1,6304681372,This is an excellent show. Bernadette Peters kills as the witch. The number of stars is solely for the terrible quality of the bluray. I've got the original DVD that I bought several years ago. And I was hoping that they would remaster the show for bluray release. Especially since they're getting ready to put out a feature film. I've looked at the DVD and the new bluray. And scarily enough I think the upconverted DVD might actually be a shade better on video quality than this bluray release. VERY disappointing. If you're looking to buy this for the first time don't waste the extra money for the bluray. Get the DVD. The quality will be just as good and it's cheaper. If you already have it on DVD don't waste your money to upgrade to blu. It's not worth it.,1417478400,30,764,4.425531914893617

919654,2,6304681372,"While I enjoyed to some extent the irreverence of Sondheim's musical with traditional stories, the final act left nothing for redemption.  It plays to the usual modernist tongue-in-cheek criticism of the old fables, but it brings no solutions.  Somehow the giantess is dead, and all have a sudden remorse/revelation of their misguided intentions...and how much of all of this is left to daddy or mommy issues?  I'm sad to see that this is becoming a movie, but given our present social dysfunction in the ""developed"" world, it is not surprising.  If you want another artifact of fallen West, this is the musical for you...it leaves you smirking at basic human values and leaves you with nothing...all the while giving you a snappy tune.",1415836800,2,736,4.959349593495935
919774,1,6304681372,"Hate to say it, but the quality is subpar. I wondered if this had originally been shot on film so they could go back to do a 16x9 high def transfer. Nope. They clearly tried an up-rez of the original video master, but it looks like it didn't go through any kinds of color correction. I actually own the old DVD and I think I prefer how that looks. The Blu-ray seems darker. Even if you are not an expert on video quality, you'll still notice the presentation does not look HiDef at all. Sure, this Blu-ray sounds good... but I can't recommend it.",1415836800,27,546,4.259615384615385

919779,3,6304681372,"Note: I bought a copy of the blu-ray version at the INTO THE WOODS: Reunion show on Nov 9, 2014.  The one day performance was at Costa Mesa, CA (Orange County) and Stephen Sondheim, James Lapine and most of the original cast was performing.  Bernadette Peters WAS AMAZING!!!  The blu-ray disc was sold as a pre-release (prior to official Dec 2 release date) in conjunction with the reunion show.

Didn't know how to rate the blu-ray, but I guess the only conclusion I had was to average it to 3 stars!
- - 5 STARS for the musical itself.  This is one of Sondheim's best in my opinion.
- - 1 STAR for the Blu-ray transfer itself.  The color saturation is off, few stuttering scenes with artifacts and some of the scenes look really blurry, especially when they pan out to show the entire stage.  (Closeups aren't that bad though).  I shouldn't be surprised since this the original source wasn't shot in HD. I think the original was taped on video so a transfer may be more difficult.  But there are a lot of other older TV shows out there shot on video and have better blu-ray transfers.  And so, like many of us who have been wanting a blu-ray version of this show, I think many will be disappointed.  The DVD version is actually more watchable because you don't have some of the transfer issues associated to the conversion, and thus less distracting. Plus...like the DVD, there are no extras.  Overall, transferring this to blu-ray was pretty moot.

Still....the musical is great and the performances were wonderful.  Too bad this was videotaped before they incorporated the song ""Our Little World"" into the production.  I love that song between the witch and Rapunzel.",1415577600,101,1671,4.6552901023890785

I've done this show before.  It is my favorite musical and this is a terrific performance.  The stage machinery and production in general are outstanding.  The filming is surprisingly good, panning out to show the whole stage when needed and always keeping at least some of the scenery in frame. This is important, since 'the woods' is almost another chatacter.

920056,5,6304681372,"Excellent performances by the entire cast and a production that will appeal to older (age 7 and up) children as well as adults-- though you might end up with some uncomfortable questions about what Prince Charming and the Baker's Wife were doing in the woods.  Act I is the typical happy ever after G rated production.  Act II is darker and more philosophical and problematic  (PG).  Of course, every kid can identify with the question ""How do I know what I want till I get what I want and I see if I like it?""",1408320000,,510,4.336842105263158

But once the narrator is gone, they have to learn to face their challenges on their own--but they are never really alone. The music is fantastic.

The music often sounds like a lot of noise in the background, since it's in a minor key and full of dissonance.  However, it's a heartfelt story full of laughter, tears, etc.  I wouldn't say it's one of my favorites, but it was definitely worth the watch.  Bernadette Peters was great in this rendition!",1399766400,,392,4.791044776119403

920268,5,6304681372,"The original production of ""Into the Woods"" brought together a first-rate cast of Broadway professionals, top to bottom, and in conductor Paul Gemingiani it had the ideal interpreter of Sondheim's scores. What more can I saythis is a delight from beginning to end. Bernadette Peters is at her best, Chip Zien and Joanna Gleason are wonderful, the Princes are appropriately supercilious, the teenaged Danielle Ferland was a precocious star as Little Red Riding Hood. I could go right down the cast with the same kind of comments, but you get the idea. The production is on the best level of Broadway productions. I found the sound and visual qualities to be very good throughout. If you love Sondheim, you will want this DVD. Period.",1396569600,,732,4.911290322580645

Even so, the quality of the performances and the skillful filming of the show make this a great introduction to the magic of Broadway that many stage-to-screen adaptations can't match.",1396483200,,280,4.8125
920270,4,6304681372,"Good story line but I got a bit confused as to who was who due to large cast and mixing of several well-known fairy tales.  No deep messages here, but very funny.  Sondheim does it again!",1393200000,,187,4.166666666666667

920315,5,6304681372,This is such a fun show. I love how they connect all of the fairy tales into one story. It is cool that they are all connected by the same woods. It is a long show so make sure you have 3+ hours to spend watching it.,1391212800,,216,3.617021276595745

It is part comedy, part drama, and part fable.  It does have a big, bad wolf, who for some really bizarre reason has human male parts, which are hard to dismiss.  Not sure why they did that, as without it, it would have been perfect for younger children as well as adults.  Most distracting.

920572,5,6304681372,"Although Into the Woods only received two Tony Awards, it is one of the most cleverly crafted, entertaining musicals of Sondheim's career.  The story and direction by Lapine is very clever and complex, combining the fairy tales of Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk, Cinderella, and Rapunzal woven into the nonfairy tale story of a baker and his wife trying to remove a witch's curse so they can have a child.  It explores what happens after the phrase, ""And they lived happily ever after,"" the common conclusion of many fairy tales.  It is very humorous, especially the first act.  The second act has humor but is much darker in tone.  There are very good songs with inciteful, thoughtful, and humorous lyrics that touch many common contemporary themes: love, loss of innocense, responsibility, faithfulness, loneliness, blame and so much more.  Everyone who grew up hearing most common fairy tales should see this musical.  Yes, it is lengthy (its major shortcoming) but worth the time.",1359072000,,993,5.0182926829268295

I really enjoyed A Little Night Music, so I don't think it's the fault of Sondheim. It's probably a tremendous piece if it can be experienced the right way.",1356912000,4,553,4.266666666666667

920611,5,6304681372,"If there's a modern-day Shakespeare who understands and translates the complicated relationships of the 20th--and 21st--centuries into accessible, entertaining, moving works, it's Steven Sondheim, as I see it. I haven't seen or listened to all of his works but based on what I have seen (Gypsy, Pacific Overtures, Sunday in the Park with George, Company, Into the Woods, to name a few), he pretty much nails it. If there's one Sondheim work that sums it all up for us, Into the Woods is it. Basing the show on familiar, centuries-old fairy tales(Cinderella, Jack and the Beanstalk, Little Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel, and nods eventually to Sleeping Beauty and Snow White), Sondheim weaves a story that takes basic human emotions, relationships, desires, weaknesses, struggles, disapointments, sorrows, failures, and triumphs and turns out a tapestry that explains the things we do selfishly and selflessly that make us all human, and worthy. Good and evil are not as simple as  black and white, as some who adhere strictly to religious beliefs would have us believe. Children are not perfect and symbolic witches and giants are not evil incarnate. The songs ""Children Will Listen"" and ""No One is Alone"" instruct more about the human condition than most will ever get from any psychology textbook. I saw Into the Woods in the late 1980s when my first child was very young and its impact on my childraising skills, and my understanding of my relationships with my parents and significant others, was like a lightbulb turning on. I have given the DVD of the Bernadette Peters production and/or the original cast album (the production of which tells the story succinctly without even seeing the show) to relatives and friends with children, as a gift. Into the Woods is a gift from Steven Sondheim. I watch or listen to it often and it always moves me, sometimes to tears. It's not always available so if you're interested in it, I suggest you grab it when you can. The LP was produced with a libretto of the show, a special treat, if you can find it. Note: the DVD is a videotaped production of a live show on Broadway starring Ms. Peters and an outstanding cast. The laughter and applause is not hammy and the production is exceptional. I gave this five stars because that's the scale, but I give it 10 in this review. Note also: it's not for small children, but children of 10-12 will probably be engaged. I suggest watching it as a family. The lessons may escape the children but the story is engaging and they will probably remember it and want to see it again. It will mean more on later viewings. Into the Woods should be an essential part of the family library. You should definitely go Into the Woods.",1356739200,,2705,4.77991452991453

920616,5,6304681372,"A great teacher recommended this to me when I was preparing to play a wolf in my senior year of high school.  The play wasn't a fairy tale piece, but she believed the characterization of the classic wolf in this musical was something to inspire, if not emulate.  I should've known right away what I was going to watch was quality because of the mentorship she'd always provided me, but I was not prepared for something this great and delightful.

This interwoven fairy tale re-telling displays some of the best characterizations of classic fairy tale characters.  The dialogue and plot both display some of the original origins, form, and morals of the stories which inspired it while still bringing something fresh and new to them.  Most dramatically, the second act brings about an amazingly dark and poignant story of consequence and a morality of blame.

All together, Into the Woods is excellent.  I've known this musical for about eight years now and I'm still singing parts of the soundtrack at random.  Get it, watch it, love it!",1355788800,,1037,4.8192090395480225

I love the musical; it's clever and witty, but still manages to strike a chord and convey an important message (more than one, actually). Adding a spin to our favorite classic fairy tales, Into the Woods goes beyond ""Happily Ever After"" to show us the reality of life: the heartbreak, the betrayal, the unexpected. It even brushes against the darker side of humanity (failure to resist temptation, need to place blame, inability to accept consequences, willingness to hurt others in order to remain safe ourselves) without becoming too dark. Each character is shown to have both good and bad traits, making for a very accurate and relatable depiction. At the same time, an incredibly well-written and hilarious script prevents the musical from feeling too heavy and depressing. The pace is quick, but the audience doesn't get lost thanks to the familiarity of the interwoven stories. The set is stunning, the writing immaculate, the songs catchy, the acting superb...not much else needs to be said. Overall a phenomenal production, and I am extremely grateful that this version exists and is available in such good quality.

920655,5,6304681372,"Wow! INTO THE WOODS is a winner on all levels. What a fun and wonderful romp into the land of our fairy tale favorites. Creative and enjoyable and a total breath of freshness, INTO THE WOODS is a delight on all levels. Here is a different take on some of our most beloved fairy tales as the heros collide in one story.

A childless couple, a baker and his wife, long to be parents, but a witch, who happens to be their neighbor, placed a curse on the baker's family. They are to remain childless unless they can bring the witch several magical items - a milk white cow, a red cape, golden slippers and for extra good measure some magic beans. That shouldn't be such a hard task in the land of fairy tales.

Several fairy tales mesh into one as Little Red Riding Hood goes to grandma's house but stops at the bakery first. Cinderella is dreaming of the royal ball. Jack's mother wants him to sell the family's milky white cow, who happens to be his best friend. The baker and his wife set off to find the items that will lift the curse just as Jack learns the magic beans really are magic and our Jack wreaks havoc as he steals from the giant.

The music and the scenery are an explosion of color and life. INTO THE WOODS was an award-winning Broadway musical with a score written by the great Stephen Sondheim. Fortunately, a performance by the original cast was filmed for all of us to enjoy. This is an actual stage performance in front of a theater audience. You can't to feel the audience's presence with their applause and laughter. This is also a high quality film production. Several cameras were used so it is almost like they were filming a movie. A true work of art was preserved for all time.

The cast is truly remarkable. Lovely Bernadette Peters stars as the evil witch who has had an ugly curse put on her. Danielle Ferland is a cute but street-wise Red Riding Hood. Joanna Gleason is another standout as the baker's wife. The cast is just wonderful from the two not so also charming princes to Jack's long-suffering mother. Lots of love and inspiration was added to this production and it is an absolute delight.",1332201600,,2128,4.420918367346939

Perhaps people think it drags because it changes to from comedy to drama the way a song changes tempo, like going from allegro to andante. Basically, you get all hyped up on the cool funnies, and then it gets extremely serious in the second act.

HOWEVER, the second act is really the heart of this musical. All the meaning is there in the second act, and the music and the lyrics make you feel the story. Do not be fooled by the first act, for all the cleverness is in the second.

Also, did anyone notice the Wolf's huge slong? It was totally huge - lol. I never noticed that before.  Wonder if it was there when i saw it on stage.",1310256000,,694,4.164179104477612
920700,5,6304681372,"This musical is a family favorite. I wore my VHS out and had to repurchase it on DVD. If you've not seen this yet, I highly recommend it.

This is a filmed Broadway play/musical and not a movie.  There are two acts with a brief intermission between them.  Act one, is a basic re-telling of several well loved fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm - Not the Walt Disney version of these fairy tales, but the darker versions with dark consequences.

The fairy tales are woven together with the common thread of the woods that surrounds the Kingdom that they live in.

The fairy tales in Act One are:
Cinderella
Jack and the Beanstalk
Rapunzel
Little Red Riding Hood
And the story of the Baker and His Wife
Of course we have THE Wicked Witch

A Narrator helps explain the story along and the characters interact with each other in a wonderful way that helps all the stories progress to their normal conclusion of ""Happily Ever After"".

The songs (and dialogue) are wickedly funny and very entertaining.

Act two begins AFTER ""Happily Ever After"".  Now, what happens after ""happily ever after""?  Well, that is indeed the best part.  So, if you've ever wondered, this is the DVD for you.  It's great family entertainment.

Disclaimer:
~ The only one tiny bit of concern is perhaps the wolf's costume.  One of my friend's was offended by the wolf's costume ~ in the scene where he interacts with Little Red Riding Hood in the forest.  The costume is apparently anatomically correct.  Now how she saw this, I'm not sure, but after much debate, we re-watched (after removing the children from the room) in slo-mo and it may be true, there really is a lot of fur and it wasn't that important to me, but if you think this might bother you, be advised.  I do not consider the scene sexual in any way, but she felt that scene was extremely suggestive.  Different perspectives...",1309824000,2,1862,4.590909090909091
920701,5,6304681372,"I LOVED this purchase!! I must say though, Into the Woods is one of my most favored musicals and Bernadette Peters is an absolute scream. The music in this is AMAZING and I always find myself singing the songs for weeks after I watch this. You might as well go ahead and buy the soundtrack while you're at it because the music is my favorite thing about this.

I gave this 5 out of 5 stars because it does deserve that, but I will say a couple things did bother me. The diction is sometimes difficult to understand in this version of Into the Woods since it's being filmed on a stage. I know every word of this show since I saw it on stage first and absolutely itched to buy the soundtrack to listen to the songs over and over, but my mom watched this with me and she had never seen Into the Woods at all. She pointed out to me that it's hard to follow sometimes since much of the story is sung and their diction isn't always perfect.

The only other piece of critique my mom offered was about the show itself. She claimed that the second act of the show was radically different from the first. The first act is loopy and silly humor, but the second act is more serious as conflict arises and needs to get resolved. I would agree with her on that, but even though the songs get more serious, they are still some of my favorite songs in musical theater.

All in all, this is a GREAT version of an amazing show. The actors are FANTASTIC, the music is intoxicatingly magnificent, and the story is captivating and moving.

I've never understood why it has not received more attention that it has.  There are numerous brilliant performances including those by Bernadette Peterson and Joanna Gleason.  Be aware that this is not a studio production. It is a recording of a live theater performance but the quality is very good.  Other than a few suggestive lyrics and one costume, the musical is appropriate for most children.  Very small ones might be frightened by the Wolf (whose costume is a bit obscene -- let's say he's a well-endowed wolf --  but most kids probably won't pick up on it).  There are lots of characters and story lines they will recognize:  Cinderella, Jack and the Bean Stalk, Rapunzel, and Red Riding Hood. There is plenty hear for adults, though -- the story lines are interwoven in creative ways and cleverly twisted versions of the originals.

Act One weaves together the fairy tales of our childhoods:  Cinderella, the Baker-Man, Little Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk, Rapunzel, and of course, the Wicked (?) Witch and the Narrator to link them all together.  Act Two adds Sleeping Beauty and Snow White, and shows what happens AFTER the ""happily ever after"" ending of the fairy tales.

This musical is also true to the original, historical spirit of the fairy tales, in which fairies are not always nice folks and the tales are more often scary than reassuring (think of Hansel and Gretel, who don't even have cameo roles in this musical; now there's a violent bedtime story).

The lyrics and the dialog are clever and witty.  The songs will make you laugh and cry.  Sondheim's tunes might linger in your brain for days.  The stage sets, costumes, and props are simple and gorgeous at the same time.

920756,5,6304681372,"I first saw this in a live production, put on by a talented local company. It was my first glimpse at Stephen Sondheim's work. I was fascinated at the genius that permitted him to take these fairy tale characters, so well-known to us, and place them collectively into a new plot, which did not have such a fairy-tale nature to it.

My take is that he has taken them out of their world and placed them into our world with a human nature just like ours, capable of good and evil. It brings out a dark side of the characters that we have not witnessed before in them. A twist of that genius is that Sondheim has us looking at, and reflecting on, ourselves and our own capacity for betrayal, deceit, duplicity, and the like.

With ambition and competitive personalities like we witness in our world, this weaves a new aspect into the common ""happily ever after"" theme. The two acts give us a before and ""striving"" look, and then an ""after"" look at how this remanufactured ""living happily ever after"" theme resultantly appears.

The play has a puzzle-like quality to it. It is fast-moving with more that a few subtleties necessary to piece this puzzle together. The screenplay is a portrayal of mixed emotions, which it easily evokes from its audience. There is laughter and sadness--seriousness and diversions--satire and wit, mixed with a powerful and entertaining score of music from beginning to end--which too is part of the puzzle!

I bought this on DVD so that I could continue what I failed to complete at the theatre. I watched it twice so far. It was all the more delightful on the screen with the wonderful close-ups of the characters and a much better sound quality. It is enjoyable, intriguing, and entertaining from beginning to end.

Weaving all the stories together (Jack and the Beanstalk, Cinderella, Rapunzel) and introducing proletariet characters in the Baker and his Wife, catchy music.  For Sondheim, catchy is rare. Beautiful is to be expected, but not catchy.

The story has a great start: get all the couples together in the first act and then examine: What would living in a tower for her whole life do to Rapunzel? Isn't a prince who likes to kiss comatose women just a little, you know, disturbing?

As a historian, I would welcome a chance to sit down with Lapine and take him to task for the obvious fiction: he said he went to the ""original"" tales to make this story. No. He didn't. There is no original tale. These are folk traditions and no one knows who wrote what. On top of which, they did not grow ""corn"" in medieval Europe--a key plot point-- and the Baker of that time did not run a little shop. That's not what they meant by Baker; they mostly meant the person to whom you brought your food for baking because so few had ovens. I would not mind the anachronisms if they hadn't made such a big deal about going to ""original"" sources, but, whatever gets you publicity, I guess.

The cast is uniformly marvelous. Every character has something to like. It was only on the third viewing that I realized how much of that has to do with the wonderful acting. If you just pay attention to the words, the Baker's Wife is really not a nice person. She is a liar and a cheat and terribly, selfishly immature.  But Joanna Gleason is so warm and her acting so good that she gives the impression of a complex, conflicted character. And Chip Zien as the Baker is good in every way.

Kim Crosby as Cinderella also acts better than the material and sings like an angel. the only weak singing is the Narrator, but he is not meant to sing well. Bernadette Peters sings and acts beautifully but I think the director made her just a little too nasty, even for a witch.

Biggest complaint is the thing runs so darn long. It's like the Ring Cycle. You totally get what's going on halfway before any one song is over. It goes from moving to tedious and stays there for just about the whole second act.

If you have a lot of time and really like Sondheim, this is a great show.",1266105600,4,2320,4.404205607476635

I'm willing to extend the play Into the Woods the benefit of the doubt since it has legions of followers and filmed adaptations are rarely successful, but on screen the musical is undone by a fundamental disconnect between the entertaining and lively first half and the slow and uninvolving second half; I suppose it'll do for people who are interested in the material and can't find it on a stage, but it's not a very enjoyable watch.

920996,5,6304681372,"I am the sort of person who is not quick to praise.  Most Broadway recordings, even if I adore the show, will have, in my mind, something lacking ... a poorly-done scene here or there, an actor lacking in talent or passion, etc., etc.

However, this original Broadway cast videorecording of Into the Woods is nothing short of perfection.  Stephen Sondheim is a genius of a lyricist and composer, and this is some of his finest work.  The cast more than does him justice.

On the female side, Bernadette Peters stands about 5 feet tall, but her presence commands the stage.  Joanna Gleason captures the Baker's Wife flawlessly, and Danielle Ferland as Little Red Riding Hood portrays youth and innocence in a sufficiently obnoxious yet loveable fashion.  Kim Crosby (Cinderella) has a beautiful, soaring soprano and acting ability to spare, giving a character which could come off as static a good deal of depth.

Chip Zien as the Baker has a quirky emotive quality to his voice that proves powerful, as we are made privy to his roller-coaster of emotions on his quest for a child and for happiness.  Robert Westenberg as the Big Bad Wolf and Prince Charming was sufficiently pompous and almost seductive, with a vocal richness unmatched in this production.

I couldn't write this review without giving a paragraph of praise to Ben Wright (Jack).  I believe he was not much more than 20 years old (if that) during this performance ... but I can't imagine ""Giants in the Sky"" being sung any better, by anyone.  Many Jacks get caught up in exuberant youthful giddiness, which has a place but tends to be overdone and annoying.  Wright embodied a frightened, excited, confused, overwhelmed, sweet boy trying to grasp ""a world like none that [he's] ever known ...""  His voice is accurate, clear, and smooth as can be, highlighting subtle vocal phrases which are often overlooked.

His performance alone is reason enough to buy this DVD or VHS.  The fact that the rest of the cast is nearly as good makes it a ""can't miss.""",1207353600,,2017,4.769452449567724

921001,5,6304681372,"About six weeks ago, I watched this DVD of Stephen Sondheim's ""Into the Woods."" It happened to be on my Netflix queue because I was curious about Sondheim's work. What a delightful surprise to discover this piece of work (which is not even considered Sondheim's best.)

The story melds several traditional fairy tales (Little Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk, Cinderella) into one with the addition of three new characters: the Baker, the Baker's wife, and the witch. One aspect I really enjoyed was the ensemble nature of the work. No one character dominates and pretty much every major player has at least one great song. The casting was terrific; everyone acted superbly (the standout being Joanna Gleason as the Baker's wife). I also really liked the fact that each character had a unique voice (not chosen just to be beautiful and melodic, but to fit the character). The book by James Lapine was also very funny and witty, matching Sondheim's clever lyrics.

None of the songs are really show-stopping with the exception of ""Giants in the Sky"" and ""Children Will Listen"" in the Act II finale. But that's fine because ""Into the Woods"" is an ensemble work and you really have to watch the whole thing to appreciate it. Unlike the other musicals I've seen (Les Miserables, Phantom of the Opera, etc), the acting was more important than the singing. Not that the singing was bad, but I really enjoyed the fact that the actors and actresses put so much effort into being the characters. The most amazing song is Joanna Gleason's performance of ""Moments in the Woods."" It was wonderful to see her express different moods with slight movements of her head and facial expressions and even do little things like fix up her hair while singing.

What I really like about the songs in Into the Woods is that they're tied to a character's thinking and slightly ambiguous. Little Red wonders whether she did the right thing ""straying off the path."" Cinderella debates whether she should tell the Prince who she really is. Perhaps that is why some people find Sondheim unusually cerebral for a songwriter. The ambiguous nature of ""Into the Woods"" is fitting since the woods are a metaphor for our journey through life.

Bernadette Peters is the main attraction and she does a wonderful job with the witch, but I find the character of the witch to be a little shallow compared to the Baker and the Baker's wife. As an example, I really loved the song ""It Takes Two"" where the Baker and Baker's wife sing about how they need each other.

To sum up, ""Into the Woods"" was a wonderful introduction to Sondheim's work and I look forward to more!

Additional note: I just read a Sondheim interview where Sondheim summarized ""Into the Woods"" as a Bronx couple (the Baker and his wife) living in a world of fairytale characters. What an apt and succinct characterization! It makes the show seem even funnier.",1200700800,,2896,4.758964143426295

As a result, the audience doesn't always warm up to the collaborations in which Sondheim finds interesting. To have the foresight to hire Terry Hughes to place four cameras on the stage of the Martin Beck Theatre to capture ""Into The Woods"" for it's premier production was nothing short of brilliance. Thirty years from now, this will be a treasure: Johanna Gleason, Bernadette Peters, Kim Crosby, Chip Zien. One never forgets that we are watching a live performance, yet the cameras do the work of a director who is a genius-only a television director could pull this off.

Here, being characters from genuine fairy tales, the cast never emerges as anything but playthings in a morality tale, a slick and profound adult lesson to be sure, but with cut-out mature representation almost verging on the parody of ""Avenue Q"", that never wanders far from the simplistic fairly tales it draws from.  Bernadette Peters' 'Witch' seems inspired by an ""I Love Lucy"" episode, and it is typical of the superficial characterizations the musical offers. Still, it delivers what you can expect from a Sondheim/Lapine project; a sweeping musical that ultimately offers produndity in the mundane.

I feel the trade off was worth it, as my original live viewing from the upper balcony lacked the detail the camera can provide.  Even at 2.5 hours, the show kept the attention of the whole family.

This especially detracts from what one wishes to see in a play; the staging.  By forcing the viewer's perspective, this version does a disservice to a very fine play that investigates our relationships with each other through fairy tales and their aftermath.

921246,5,6304681372,"My high school performed a non-musical, one-act version of this play when I was a sophmore, and ever since, I've absolutely loved this play.  It has such a wide range of side-splitting comedy to tear-jerking drama, and such colorful characters, hardly anyone I know who has seen it hasn't liked it.

The first act tells the stories of Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk, Rapunzel, and the Baker and His Wife as they're familiar to all of us, with a few twists, and all who deserve to get to live happily ever after.....

The second act opens showing that all of our characters, while having everything they thought they always wanted, are still discontent, and then, because of the mistakes they made trying to get what they wanted, they find themselves having to save their sanity and their lives against the biggest enemy they've ever had to deal with.

Particularly brilliant in their roles of the Baker's Wife and The Wicked Witch are Joanna Gleason and Bernadette Peters, both very talented singers and commediennes with real believability as the reckless wife and the heartbroken mother.

My favorite songs are Agony (by the two princes), The Witches Rap (telling the beginning of the Rapunzel story), and No More (a ballad sung by Chip Zien and Tom Alderidge about dealing with the present).",1145750400,2,1322,4.883928571428571

921248,5,6304681372,"""Midway in Life's journey, I found myself lost in a dark wood, having lost my way""...Dante ""The Divine Comedy""

This may be the inspiration for this wonderful story.
The 1988 Tony award winning musical affords an exquisite experience on many levels. Sondheim taps into the essence of Jungian psychology through the masterful use of interweaving fairytales, connecting the archetypal world with the personal, culminating in a story of the journey we all must make through life from innocence, suffering and at last to understanding and wisdom. The music and the lyrics are filled with depth, humor, pathos. This is no children's fairytale but a metaphoric exploration of life's very real dangers and the resulting initiation.
The DVD was taped directly from a television taping of the actual play so it has no special features and is fairly skeletal in its format.
Nevertheless, the performances are impassioned and almost flawless; especially those of the incomparable Bernadette Peters as the witch and Joanna Gleeson as the Baker's wife.  Whether one loves musicals or not, this is a must see.",1140480000,,1095,5.1807909604519775

I was also surprised by the amount of real tears that were shed by the actors; Little Red's performance during No One Is Alone almost made me cry myself.

921319,5,6304681372,"I will be performing this musical soon as Little Red Riding Hood and for hours I have watched this movie, not only to learn my charecter, but to be constantly amazed at the creativy and how flawessly it flowed together. The songs are simply wonderful, and I must congradulate anyone who has done this because those were the hardest songs I've ever had to learn.

Imagine all those faerie tale charecters you read about as a child. Now imagine them all messed up. Jack's an idiot and his best friend is a cow. Little Red is a greedy brat who carries around a knife and a wolf-skin coat after she mets the wolf. Prince Charming and his brother are ladies' men. Rapunzel goes insane. Stuff like that only happens in Into the Woods.

The story starts out with everyone having a certain wish. So they go into the woods to have it granted and met other people along the way. Act 1 is devoted to this. Act 2, on the otherhand is much darker and probably wouldn't be good for young children to watch. THe wife of the now dead giant is loose and crushing houses and killing people. The narrator is sacrificed and by the end of the story, only 4 charecters have survived and they go off to begin thier new life together.

921322,3,6304681372,"I must admit, I wasn't sure what I was getting into when this film arrived at my doorstep.  With pensiveness in my eyes, I placed the DVD into my player and watched ... surprisingly ... a play unfold before my eyes.  I knew it was a play, but I didn't realize this was nothing more than the stage version placed in DVD format.  With no special features, I dived directly into the action.  Song after song, joke after joke, familiar story line crossed with unfamiliar stories, I patiently waited to explore the finale of this extremely creative play.  With an hour and a half down, I thought the film was over.  I didn't see what the excitement was about, it was creative, but not shockingly bold ... then the second act began and my jaw dropped.  Darkness finally crept into these fairy tales and opened a fresh new door for our dated characters to explore.

I must give tons of credit to Stephen Sondheim's creative mind.  Without his ability to dive deeper within a story than imaginable, I do not think there would have been much desire for me to sit through this three-hour epic.  Thankfully, Sondheim has this ability to constantly keep you guessing.  There were not many scenes in this performance that seemed stale, or overused.  There were clean and creative moments that kept you guessing until the very end.  I kept my eyes glued to the screen because I never knew which direction Sondheim was going to take next.  Was he going to follow classic form, or branch away into a powerful new area that has yet to be explored?  Thankfully, he broke away and created a story that set in motion the several thousands of other fairy tale rediscoveries.

Coupled with Sondheim's powerful penmanship, we also have James Lapine's amazing direction.  With a film like this, basically taking a live-performance and releasing it on DVD, there was that opportunity to go extremely stale and find yourself watching what looks like a ""high school"" parent's videotaped production.  This version has extremely crisp editing, you can see the actors, you can hear what they are saying, and it feels as if you are right on the front row watching these powerful performances unfold in front of you.  Lapine does an excellent job with his positions of the cameras and ability to focus on exactly whom we need to be watching.  He keeps us centered on the story and characters without constantly reminding us that it is a play.  He does a great job of taking us into the story, away from the stage, and giving us life away from the theater.  If you force yourself to accept that it is only a play, than you will see the stage, the stagehands, and everything else that follows live theater, but if you get swept away into the songs, characters, and story, as I did, then you will see a fairy tale unfold in front of you.

While I did enjoy the quality of the DVD and the creativity of Stephen Sondheim, there were some elements that I just could not escape.  One happened to be the songs.  While I loved the opening songs of the first act, in fact finding myself tapping my toes to several of the melodies, the second act felt as if I was listening to the same songs over and over again.  The second act became repetitious to me.  The songs, as well as the length, just seemed to be a bit overwhelming.  I found my mind wandering, when I wanted to focus on what was happening on screen.  I think this is because of the different versions of the SAME song coupled with elongated speeches.  This may sound weird, but I loved the second act.  It was dark, spooky, and showed a new side to fairytales that we had not been accustomed to exploring.  Yet, I hated the second act as well.  It just seemed to drag on and on without a true direction in sight.  I understood what needed to happen, but it just didn't feel as crisp as the opening act.  The characters seemed a bit stale, the surroundings seemed a bit boring, and I just felt as if it had lost some of the creative genius that I witnessed in the opening act.  While I hate to blame anyone (especially after the lesson learned in this film), but there was too much focus on Bernadette Peters, who was the obvious star of the play.  This was an ensemble performance and needed to be treated as such.  The second act focused a bit too much on Peters' Witch characters while it needed to explore everyone's emotions equally.  Outside of these two issues, I felt this was a fun, fantastical film that introduced me into a new chapter of fairy tales.

Overall, I was impressed.  I really desire to see the play now, but don't know if I can sit through another 2.5 hour performance.  It was great, but not worthy of another viewing.  While I loved the creativity and the DVD transfer, I felt that the second act of this play was a bit sloppy.  It needed to be tightened, strengthened around the darkness of the characters, and everyone brought together as a group, instead of individually.  The ending smelled a bit cheesy, but allowed for all resolutions to be solved.  There is so much that I loved about the second act (like the darkness and the chaos surrounding indestructible storybook characters), but there were equally the same amount of dislikes that spawned from the second act.  Good, but not great, powerful, yet didn't seem to drive that nail home.  Applauding Sondheim and Lapine, penalizing Peters and the uncreative repetitions of the songs.

The production sparkles, and it's great to see Barbara Bryne in it because she's been superbly comic at the Stratford Festival in Ontario.  Speaking of which, their current production of ITW is brilliant and dazzling, far bolder than the original, and--dare one say?--the voices are better.  Much better.

Even given that this was a filming of a stage production, the camera work is brilliant -- look at the staging in ""Last Midnight"" to see how well it works.

And the book, lyrics, staging, scoring and casting all are flawless. Bernadette Peters is spectacular, if I can single out some of her brilliant moments, look for her transformation in seconds from Old Witch to Young Witch, and her comic pantomime of eating a bug -- to be seen to be believed, and laughed at.

Among the new cast members, Joanna Gleason as the Baker's Wife and Chip Zien as the Baker are fine, as others have pointed out, as is Ben Wright as Jack. Tom Aldredge as the Narrator and Mysterious Man, and Robert Westenberg as the Wolf and Cinderella's Prince (he was in Sunday in the Park, BTW), pull off brilliant and droll performances in dual roles.

Bernadette Peters was phenomenal. People may have doubts with her singing abilities, but we can say with certainty that as a performer she's undoubtedly if not the best one of the best. She has such a presence that just grabs you completely and she has a great comedic timing She is perfection. Another stand out is Joanna Gleason who won a Tony for her role. She has such a great timing. She never missed a beat, all her lines were spot on.

The songs were all wonderful and probably the most hummable collection of songs by Stephen Sondheim. But his trademark profound and meaningful lyrics are still there. Children will Listen is a great song that has a very observant lyrics. Agony was just plain hilarious. And the titular song, Into the Woods, is catchy and a great opener.

The Act1 is funnier and lighter. Bernadette Peters's entrance as the Witch was memorable. I love how the show mocked itself (""You talk to birds...?"" ""Rapunzel, what kind of name is that?""). Really funny script. The Act 2 tells what happens after the usual happily ever after and it's darker in tone, but it's still witty and funny and charming.

921403,5,6304681372,"The first time I heard anything from this show was when someone in acting class sang ""Children Will Listen"" as part of a class performance project.  Since the rendition was not exactly stirring, I wrote it off.  Then I got this video for my birthday.  I proceeded to kick myself repeatedly for not having seen it sooner.

The show begins with a retelling of the macabre fairy tales we all know so well (Cinderella, Jack & the Beanstalk, et al.).  It then proceeds to dismantle all of our preconcieved notions about them.  We begin to realize that the characters in the stories never had to deal with the consequences of thier actions (and let's face it, some of their actions are horrific).

The beauty of the show is in the new and different portrayal of familiar characters. We see the dysfunctional princes whose need for adventure far outweighs the love they have for their spouses once the damsels are out of distress.  We meet a ""wicked"" witch who, in trying to protect her child from the evils fo the world, ends up destroying her.  We see that each of the characters are so driven by their own agenda that they never stop to think the effect they have on others.

The performances here are beautifully executed with particular kudos for Joanna Gleason and Bernadette Peters for creating heart-breaking, hilarious characters.  This is what musical theater acting is meant to be.

I have heard many critics say that this show should end at Act 1.  Once again, Sondheim gets accused of being cerebral.  Those of you reading this who have not seen the show: do NOT see a Sondheim show if you want to see mindless entertainment.  If you like cutesy musicals, you will not like this or any other show written by this composer...I guarantee it. See this if you want to be entertained and you don't mind using your brain in the process.  This show really is a thing of beauty and very, very funny.",1116201600,3,1897,4.601190476190476
921404,5,6304681372,"After watching the life out of the Sweeney Todd DVD, [With George Hearn]I wanted to see another Sondheim musical so I spent 30 bucks and bought this. IT IS AMAZING! The set, the backround, the cast...everything is just awesome! We have the very talented origial cast but the main thing to buy this has to be because BERNEDETTE PETERS STARS IN IT! The role was WRITTEN for her! It is just great especially the Midnight songs. The first act and the begining of the second act are hilarious but then, towards the end,it's gets darker. Most of cast dies at then end. But the moral of this story [That's in the second act] is that no one has a happy ending. Miserable things happen [Especially if you are bad] in life and no one gets a perfect life. People you love die, things around you go away, it may seem scart but that's life. It also goes to show that the evil never win. The evil ALWAYS loose and they are ALWAYS punished, even if they are free for a little while, they will always get punished. Take the Whitch in this story for example. She was evil. She was punished and died at the end. In today's world you can see the same thing happen to people like Saddam Husain. He was free to do evil things for a long time, but soon, he was caught and punished and now he has to spend the rest of his life in jail. So even if the things I've just listed seem scary and don't seem right for children, I'd think your wrong because this is a great family movie. It might be best for a little more mature kids [Kids that can take an unhappy ending and are not scared of witches and that kind of stuff] but I reccomend the first act for any child of any age. But the meaning of the story is in the second act.

The story is fabulous, the set and props are too cool and the actors are AWESOME! I reccomend this totally and I also reccomend Sweeney Todd. Sondhiem RULES musical theatre! I hope this review is helpful for those who have heard from others...",1114819200,2,1947,4.2198391420911525

Although the darker, more melancholy second act provides a sharp contrast to the first act's supposed 'happily ever after', I found it less jarring than interesting, and my favorite song (Last Midnight) is in it, so...yes. At the risk of sounding cliche, this is not to be missed. Even if (for some odd, inexplicable reason) the plot bores you, in my opinion it's all worth it for Bernadette Peters singing 'Lament' and 'Last Midnight'. Stunning, incredible, awe-inspiring, whatever positive adjective you want it will apply. ^^

A warning, however: the songs from it seem to get stuck in your head for days. I've had 'Last Midnight' running through my head for the past two weeks or so and I keep getting this urge to swirl around a swishy cloak that I don't have.",1110067200,2,935,4.807453416149069
921471,2,6304681372,"This musical is very interesting.  I don't know exactly how to describe it.  The first half was pretty boring for me and it was so long I thought the finale for act one was the end.  The second half drew my attention in a negative way.  I really didn't like the way things ended up.  The giant killing so many people really didn't seem necessary to me to prove the point of this musical.  The way people were killed almost out of comedy drove me in sane death is never a light moment.

What drove me crazy even more was how the baker's wife died.  I hate in when main characters die, but at least in some musicals its a very touching death, but here you don't really feel bad after her affair with the prince and this takes away from her husband and the audiance feeling for her.  I guess what I mean is it would have been ever more moving if she died with out the affair, and her husband said and did all that stuff after she passed away.

I also hate the fact of recreating fairytales and making the characters look bad.  Why do we always have to poke fun about these tales?  It almost seems like they arn't respected at all at times.  Musicals like Once Upon a Mattress and Cinderella were cleaver and wonderful because they stuck to the characteristics of the main characters.  I think sometimes people take to many liberties with character and it ends up like Into the Woods.  All the characters were made weird and unlovable by the time the final curtain in the second act fell. (with maybe the exception of Cinderella).

On a more positive note there was some amazing songs and amazing actresses and actors singing them.  ""no One is Alone"" is my favorite and it is beautiful.  Some of the songs seem really repetative however.  The set seemed really cheesy as well, and the fake animals and fake giant just added to the disaster.",1109376000,9,1836,4.378698224852071

921474,5,6304681372,"This was the first Sondheim musical I had ever seen, and I must say that it blew me away. The fairytale element added a level of appeal to it, and an amazing cast help to boost it to a stellar performance.

The prologue was fantastic. The only gripe I have is that the tiered structure of Jack, Cinderella, the Baker, and his wife makes it a little overwhelming and sends the mind into overdrive. Still, once you get a hang of the musical, a second-time screening makes the prologue more enjoyable. Most of the songs are catchy, and range from comedic (Agony) to tear-jerking (Stay with Me, Lament). There is a great balance of humour, and adventure, and best of all, I love how the characters walk on stage and quote a moral from their individual stories. I was a little disappointed at how the words for Agony was not as clear as it was in the cast recording CD. Westernberg and Wagner seemed a little rushed, and at times cut each other off.

Bernadette Peters put in a remarkable performance as The Witch. She moved me to tears in Stay With Me, and had me in stitches in the Prologue. When she transformed into the beautiful witch, she clearly portrayed the new air of grace came with it. Joanna Gleason played the Baker's wife to perfection. Her strong vocals and marvellous expressive skills portrays the Baker's wife to be as real as any of us - strong at times, weak at others. Danielle Ferland was outstanding as Little Red Riding Hood, adding a tinge of sarcasm to her character. Ben Wright (Jack), seemed a little wooden, but his great vocals shone in Giants In The Sky. I personally thought Kim Crosby was excellent as Cinderella although many seemed to be disappointed with her performance. She did seemed a little off on the DVD but she had a lovely voice in the cast CD. Robert Westernberg and Chuck Wagner were rightly cast.

I couldn't have asked for a better cast for this musical. It is by far, one of the best musicals I have ever seen, and I must admit that I was blown away.

Get this. You won't regret it.

Note: To those who find it shocking that the Stepsisters cut off their heel and toe to fit into the golden slipper, that is the original version by the Grimm brothers. In fact, I think the fairytales in this musical are very faithful to the originals, considering circumstances.",1100563200,6,2308,4.498806682577565
921475,2,6304681372,"Cinderella: A girl who's real name we do not know for sure. She has a father who is either neglectful or dead. Abused by her stepmother and stepsisters she is pretty miserable until she marries a prince only to find that he is having an affair.

Jack and mother: Jack must sell his best friend, a cow, makes friends with a giantess and proceeds to steal three times from her and kill her husband. When the giantess comes for revenge he kills her also. In the meantime his mother is killed by the steward to the king.

Baker and wife: After sometimes stealing and sometimes not they gather ingredients for a potion so they can have children. The baker, while looking for Jack in the woods, doesn't know that his wife is having an affair at the moment with Cinderella's husband. She dies almost right afterwards leaving behind their baby boy.

Little Red Riding Hood: After killing a wolf with her grandmother she gives her red coat away and in the chaos that ensues both her mother and grandmother die leaving her no one.

Rapunzel: When she finally makes it out of the tower she has been living in most of her life she has her hair cut off, bears 2 children and finds her blinded lover. After they get married it is not a happily ever after, her husband has an affair with Snow White and she has crazy fits.

The Witch: Although she abused Rapunzel mightily as a child she was trying to do her best. She was punished for someone taking beans out of her garden and turned ugly. Although the spell is eventually reversed she loses her power. She ends up fed up and dies (I think) by falling into the earth.

Snow White and Sleeping Beauty: Most likely have unknown affairs with the two princes, thinking they are unmarried but this is not for certain.

What story is this? None other than Into the Woods, a musical. When I rented the movie I was expecting something light hearted and fun and it generally was in the first act although Jack, the baker and wife were into stealing and the stepsisters cut up their feet and had their eyes plucked out. By the time the movie ended I was depressed and soon trudged off to bed hoping to sleep my despair out caused partly by the fact that only 4 of the main characters survived.

I don't understand why our cyncial society is so determined to sink that phrase in the cruel, unforgiving sea of reality (for more on this subject see Cervantes' soliloquoy in ""Man of La Mancha""). It is, however, always a great relief to me when I see that ""Non-happy ever after"" type shows generally always prove themselves wrong. The ending to this musical is...not what you'd expect! Ha! Thought I was gonna spoil it, didn't ya? But just the same it is  a happy one. If any ending can be called happy in the wake of horror and death, and I say sure. Sondheim's best work, in my book.

From Cinderella to Jack in the Bean Stock you get to see some of your favorite characters interact with each other. Bernadette Peters is beyond excellent as Repunzele's witch. The two Prince's are very funny ( especially towards the end. )
There are also so many great one liners that will want to make you watch it over and over.
Every one's performance in this movie is professional and entertaining.
I especially loved during close towards the end of the second first act. Were Petes' turns from a horrible nasty looking witch, to her true very beautiful forum.
 Also who are very funny are Cinderella's step sisters and her step mother. One of my favorite line is when their all facing the giant and Peter's is all like ""Excuse me... Would you like a blind girl instead?""
(Replying to the stepsisters who are now blind. Because pigeons poked out their eyes on Cinderella's wedding day.) The Stepmother says , ""How dare you!""
It's moments like those that will make you to continue watching it.
 Why even Jack's mother has some very funny and clever moments. For instant when she first meats the Prince and she 's screaming about the giant. Or when the Baker's wife tells her that she has no children and she then says, "" That's ok to.""
There are so many other wonderful actors and actresses in the movie.
In fact a couple of the actors even play two parts, and I think that is very impressive. The costumes are also very beautiful like Cinderella's dress. And it's interesting how they start the first and second act.
 There are even a couple interesting death's in the movie ( you got to see what happens to the narrator.)

921572,5,6304681372,"""Into the Woods"", though not his masterpiece (that title belongs to ""Sweeney Todd""), is proabably the great Stephen Sondheim's most poular and oft-performed show. This tremendous original cast brings the magical songs of Sondheim and the ground-breaking book of Jame Lapine's together to make for a magical Broadway experience.
When ""Into the Woods"" first opened on Broadway in 1987, it was greeted with great anticipation. After all, this was to be the newest Sondheim show... and it was starring Bernadette Peters. The show became an instant classic as audiences loved the show.
The plot revolves around the Baker and his Wife, who want to have  a child, but due to a witches's curse, cannot. They have to find ""a cow as white as milk, a cape as red as blood, hair as yellow as corn and a slipper as pure as gold"" in order to reerse the curse. On the way, they encounter many characters from well-known tales, like Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Jack the Giant Killer and Rapunzel. However, the second act involves many dark and twisted twists, as we journey onto what happenes after ""happily ever after"". The plot becomes much less joyous as in the second act...MUCH less happy. The show is magnificent on the outside, with its' intricate yet followable plot and Sondheim's masterful songs. One of the most interesting things about this musical, however, is the metaphor that extends throughout. (I'll let you figure it out yourself).
The score includes oft-recorded songs such as ""Children Will Listen"" and ""No One is Alone"". ALL of the songs are great though. From the mournful ""No More"" to hysterical ""Agony"" you will savor every moment.
The cast, including Chip Zein, Joanna Gleason and Bernadette Peters, are inmaculate. Their interpretations are dead on, with beutiful renditions of every song. Especially Gleason and Peters.
The show won the 1988 Tony's for BEST SCORE, BEST BOOK and BEST ACTRESS (Joanna Gleason who was incredible as the Baker's wife).
Buy this magnificent Sondheim show and dive into the world of Sondheim.
*****Two Notes:  1) If you would like a more complete sample of Stephen Sondheim, buy the ""Stephen Sondheim Collection"" on Amazon.com. It includes 6 DVD's: ""Into the Woods"", ""Passion"", ""Sunday in the Park with George"",  Concert of ""Sweeney Todd"", Concert of ""Follies"" (both of these concerts are incredible), and the once-in-a-lifetime event ""Sondheim: A Celebration at Carnegie Hall"".
2) If you buy the cast recording for ""into the Woods"", buy the one with this ORIGINAL CAST!! Do not buy the one from the recent revival cast, though they were great, they do not even compare with the original.",1070496000,4,2636,5.013698630136986
921573,5,6304681372,"When I first saw Into the Woods on Broadway (with the revival cast, not the original), I just didn't GET it. I enjoyed the first act very much, but was extremely confused by the second. I didn't understand how Sondheim could take such happy, classic fairy tales and shed such a negative light on them. However, then I watched this version of Into the Woods, and was completely blown away...
I watched this for one reason: Bernadette Peters. She remains one of the greatest Broadway performers ever. And I felt that her portrayal of the Witch was exceptional...she balanced out her comedy (which was always very funny) with a very real, honest display of emotion in numbers such as ""Children Will Listen."" It added a depth to the character that I'd missed out on previously. And her voice, as usual, was simply phenomenal.
However, I felt that Joanna Gleason in her portrayal of the Baker's Wife was the true highlight of this performance. I found myself rewinding to her numbers over and over again. I had never truly sympathized with this character until I watched the video, and then I was simply mesmerized. Her chemistry with Chip Zein is fantastic. ""It Takes Two"" was one of the most adorable numbers I've ever seen performed in any show! Yet the best part of the show, by far, was when she came in during the final song and sang to the Baker from behind...she sent chills up my spine and brought tears to my eyes. Not only that, but her voice was wonderful for the character! It wasn't too showy or brassy...it was absolutely perfect. I only wish that Joanna Gleason received more credit for her performance in this musical. It gave me an entirely new appreciation of the show, and now I can't help but admit how much I love it.
I honestly can't think of one person I disliked in this performance...I highly recommend the original recording as well as this VHS. The combination of Joanna Gleason and Bernadette Peters is simply unbeatable, as well as magical.",1068249600,10,1965,4.665706051873199
921574,5,6304681372,"This show was my first exposure to the work of Stephen Sondheim, which made me realize how briliant a lyricist he is.  His use in the opening number of the word ""wither"" three times in succession, each with different meanings is something that no other writer of musical theater would be able to pull off ""...while her withers wither with her....and no one keeps a cow for a friend.""
The cast is almost perfect.  Bernadette Peters as the witch is wonderful casting, though it is almost a shame that Joanna Gleason as the Baker's Wife out-shines her.  Little Red Riding Hood is a hoot, in a macabre and cynical way.  Jack (of Jack and the Beanstalk fame) is wonderfully scatterbrained.  Cinderella as a girl who isn't quite sure what she wants is wonderfully treated, as is Prince(s) Charming as men who always want the girl the can't have.  My only compliant with the castin would be Chip Zein as the Baker, who doesn't seem to quite know how to treat his character.  Then again, everyone else is so perfect in their roles, it makes any compartively weak performance stand out that muc hmore.  However, at the end of the first act, everyone is ""happy ever after""...to be continued.
The plot of the show can best be described as ""take about a dozen fairy tails, mix, bring to a boil....then kill the narrator early in the second act, just to see what happens.""  A wonderful concept, and it is pulled off well.

No shots closer than a waist shot, and the lighting is atrocious, no accomodations were made for the television cameras, thus many scenes are hidden in murk.

I wore out the first tape of ""Into the Woods"" that I had.  I drop quotes from it into conversations as if they were Star Trek or Monty Python lines.  I force my friends to watch it (ok, after 10 min. or so, they are hooked, too).
This is not a saccharine version of Grimms' tales.  When the prince comes around looking for Cinderella, the step-mother cuts off the toes of one of the step-sisters to make the shoe fit, just like in the original.  Gross, yes, but it actually ends up being pretty funny.  I've seen action adventure movies with lower body counts.  The cast feeds the narrator to the giant.  The wolf costume has genetalia.  Yet it all manages to be hysterical, with just the right tone.
This is a musical with meat.  It has serious points, but it doesn't crudely whap you over the head with them.  There are modern culture references, from the witch's rap about her garden to the Freudian stalking of Little Red Riding Hood.  But the lines...oh, the lines!  From Prince Charming's ""I was raised to be charming, not sincere"" to ""Rapunzel, Rapunzel...what kind of name is Rapunzel?"" to Little Red Riding Hood's ""You talk to birds?"" (sneered to Cinderella), the dialogue snaps along, delivered with impeccable timing by the cast.  The songs are equally good.  Who could resist the duet by Prince Charming and his brother entitled ""Agony"", about which one of them is in more pain, chasing women they can't catch.

I am not usually a musical person; however, I found myself playing this over and over. The songs are wonderful, both in their beauty and in their wit. Sondheim brought out each character's depth, showing perhaps not only their quirks, but also yearnings that the viewer can identify with. Lapine digs deep in the writing; bringing back the older, darker aspects of the beloved fairy tales, and tying all the separate storylines with the inclusion of the Baker and his wife, who wish ""more then anything"" for a child of their own. They must go on their quest to fufill the witch's (played by the ever incredible Bernadette Peters in this Broadway taping) seemingly odd shopping list.
The technical aspects will make you want to watch over and over: From the costuming, to the set design, to the lighting. Very imaginative and well done.
The second part did drag a bit for me... but the ""after happily ever"" was meant to be dark; after all, it helped illuminate that sometimes we may not want all that comes with our wishes.

Sondhiem crafts wonderfuly characters and weaves them into a story with lessons on life, living and the true nature of happiness.  My two and five year olds both sat through the entire (nearly 3 hour) performance twice with nary a wiggle!  ""Agony,"" sung in a duet by the two princes was my personal favorite, full of humor, emotion and strong vocals.  The cast is phenomenal - listening to Sondhiem's choral craftsmanship is akin to watching a well-choreographed dance.

921761,5,6304681372,"I first saw Into the Woods on VHS when I was a child. Recently, I bought the DVD and saw it again. There's much more depth to this than the fairy-tale plot lets on. The first act follows well-known stories such as Cinderella and Little Red Riding Hood, while adding a plot about the Baker and his Wife that ties the other fairy tales together. There is beautiful music by Stephen Sondheim in this act, with songs such as ""On the Steps of the Palace"" and ""Giants in the Sky"". This part ends, as usual, with ""happy ever after"" -- although, at the very end, Cinderella's haunting voice sings ""I wish!""
This wish is not quite fulfilled, and the second act -- the masterpiece of the movie -- shows what happens after ""happily ever after."" In the second act, major and minor characters alike die. Princes are revealed to be unfaithful and fickle -- as expressed best in the beautiful seduction scene of ""Any Moment"". Here, the standout actress Joanna Gleason, playing the Baker's Wife, truly shines as she is seduced by Cinderella's prince. The music shows Sondheim at his best -- Into the Woods was at the height of his career, and the lyrics are both clever and touching. Bernadette Peters also does a stellar performance as the Witch, who is revealed to be neither ugly or stonehearted.
However, the main theme of this all is parenthood. The Witch is shone as a grieving mother, as she laments that ""children won't listen."" Much of the story is centered around children and parents, from the quest at the beginning for the Baker and his Wife to be able to have a child, to the Witch's song at the end about how ""children will listen."" Beautiful, sad, and dark, this is an adult story about children, self-discovery, loss, and the realization that ""No One Is Alone"".",1026691200,,1762,4.5968253968253965

It was funny, sad, well acted, well sung, with great production values and an incredible cast.  The Baker's Wife kicks ..., as does Cinderella, her Prince, and the rest of the amazing cast.  But the Witch is my favorite, she got to be witchy yet funny and still be right about the selfish way everyone was behaving.  Plus she'd played by Bernadette Peters, who just rocks.  You will be throroughly entertained by this, no question about it.",1026604800,,593,4.444444444444445
921763,5,6304681372,"""I wish more than anything, more than life..."" sings the soprano Cinderella tying in Jack, the Baker and his wife.  In the first segment of this brilliant musical the audience learns of each character longing for something: Cinderella: A prince, Jack: His cow, Milky White, Jack's mother: Her son to quit being so dependent on a cow (and to figure out Milky White is a GIRL), the Baker: A child, his wife: again, a child and maybe some more bread.  It's simle just as the originals are.  Other characters stroll in, including Rapunzel, her prince, Cinderella's prince, a witch, a wolf, Little Red Riding Hood and a hoord of fairy tale creatures.  And, like the originals follow the tales fairly well just intertwining them.
But, the funny thing, aside from the actually stories are the dysfunctional problems these people have!  Cinderella: She's compulsive but regrets her decisions in the end; Jack: co-dependent on an animal and can't gain his man-hood; His mother: Can't let her son go; the Baker: Come on all guys want to keep their lineage no matter what! His wife: thinks a baby will keep her marriage together and ends up ruining it wih Conderella's prince; Rapunzel: Severe depression; the Witch: over-bearing mother who lives through her child.
And on and on...
This musical is so funny and such great performances!  Joanna Gleason really shines as the Baker's wife as a sort of sarcastic, take no guff girl with a romantic underside as she gets seduced (willingly) by the Prince and a soft side for her husband (Moments in the Woods).  Bernadette Peters is great too (as usual) and I love how she talks to the audience.
It's truly a great musical!

921864,5,6304681372,"Into the Woods is definitely one of the most amazing shows I've ever seen. There is not a single dull moment in this musical. Stephen Sondheim is pure genius. As for the Broadway cast of ITW, I absolutely LOVED them. Every single one of them gave outstanding performances. However, Bernadette Peters obviously stood out a great deal as the Witch, and I thought another actress who did well was the lovely Kim Crosby as Cinderella..She had a beautiful voice. But the shining star here was definitely Joanna Gleason, no question about it. Her stunning performance as the Baker's Wife could have you holding your stomach, laughing; or it could make you cry. Joanna Gleason is an amazing actress...Her acting is so simple, yet complicated at the same time..She's just incredible as the Baker's Wife. A show stopping number was her ""Moments In the Woods,"" along with ""Any Moment"" sung by Robert Westenberg as the HiLaRiOuS Cinderella's Prince... Every time I watch this part it cracks me up. Also, the beautiful duet ""No One is Alone"" done by Kim Crosby as Cinderella and Chip Zien as the Baker brings tears to your eyes... And the opening number ""Into the Woods"" is not to be missed. Another fun song is ""Your Fault,"" done in the second act which is very awesome...I've proceeded in memorizing this whole thing and I'm pretty proud of myself, lol. I have no clue how Sondheim wrote that. The finale, ""Children Will Listen,"" is a amazing as well...A great closing for the show.
Into the Woods is simply amazing... I prefer the first act over the second, though...The first is funny, heartwarming, and hilarious as we follow the Baker and his Wife into the woods to find a cow as white as milk, a cape as red as blood, hair as yellow as corn, and a slipper as pure as gold to break the curse that is keeping them from having a child. The second act is a lot more deep and dark when the giant arrives and upsets the whole kingdom. It's sad but still very enjoyable. If you are thinking of buying this video, DO! I promise you WON'T regret it.

It takes several familiar fairy tales, overlaps them ina complicated but clever plot, and manages to provide direction for our society toward communal responsibility and our need to band together to fight the giants that plague our world. Happy ever after is what we earn, not what we deserve.
  Although the ensemble works together to create a seamless show, as individuals, they shine. Joanna Gleason is the most unique actress working today. She can be simple, glamorous, sarcastic, witty, poised and spewing emotion, all at once. her Baker's Wife is everything a beautiful woman lost in the druggery of daily life should be. We see and feel her conflict between wanting a prince but settling for a baker. Chip Zien is the devoted husband and he manages to bring tears to your eyes through his heartbreaking rendition of ""No More"". Able support is given by the awkwardly beautiful Kim Crosby as Cinderella, the stoicly useless Prince of Robert Westenberg and the vicious , voracious performance of Danielle Ferland as Red Riding Hood.

To lift the curse, they must find the cape as red as blood, the cow as white as milk, the hair as yellow as gold, and the slipper as pure as glass.  Fortunately for them, they are going into the same woods that Jack, Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, and Rapunzel are entering.
The second act picks up ""Later.""  Things don't quite work out as well as everyone expected them to, and they once again find themselves entering the woods to deal with their new challenges.
The first act is a perfect musical comedy with some wonderful moments, but the second act is much darker in tone.  While it still has it's funny moments, it is much more serious.  But the dramatic turn works well, and what started out as a fun romp turns into a powerful story.  Still, because of this, I have a hard time recommending it for children.
The cast does a wonderful job.  It's really hard to pick out a highlight because everyone works well together to make it so good.  The format, video recording of a live stage performance by the original Broadway cast, took me a little time to get used to when I first watched it, but soon I forgot all about that.  The camera captures everything on stage; can't imagine a better seat in the house.

921867,5,6304681372,"This DVD is from a stage performance, and technologically it's limited by what could be done on a stage (as opposed to all the computer enhanced special effects found in movies).  Originating in a simpler medium, it brings to the fore a great script, music, story, and performances.
I have nothing but positive points to commnicate.  The story builds from well-known elements of fairy tales, and proceeds into moral ambiguity, maturation, dilemmas and choices, temptation and titillation...  The lyrics are wonderfully (deliberately) goofy and repetitive (which reinforces the child-like nature of the narratives)...  The music is engaging while being both sing-songy and yet moving from our accustomed modes.
The performances are wonderful:  Bernadette Peters plays all elements of her role as the witch to the hilt;  the Baker (Chip Zein) grows from the individualist to the interdependent person, and Zein conveys the maturation well.  Joanna Gleason (as the Baker's Wife) does a fabulous job in conveying her frustration, will to persevere, temptation...  I could go on and on...
The sets from the stage are great, and don't lose their power as a performance for your TV.

921868,5,6304681372,"Except for this one...

Bernadette Peters is so perfect as the old crone witch who turns beautiful at the end of the first act. She plays the bitter self-loathing cynic to perfection: when she sings ""Last Midnight"" its amazing, and of course the bittersweet ""Lament""/""Children Will Listen"" ties everything together...well, perfectly. A riot, and she can really belt out a tune!

At least as amazing as Ms. Peters is Tony Award-winning Joanna Gleason who is completely brilliant as the baker's wife. Her interactions with Kim Crosby (Cinderella), each night after the Festival, sparkle: every time I watch the exchange that ends with, ""I need your shoe to have a child!"" I nearly fall off my chair; her appearance as a ghost at the end is touching and a little sad.
Kim Crosby herself is quite good as Cinderella, and Danielle Ferland is wonderful as the jaded and cynical (and a little bloodthirsty) Little Red Riding Hood (she gets it from grannie, who keeps thinking of twisted ways to torture the wolf after they escape), and her song ""I Know Things Now,"" is a cute little song (with just a hint of sexual imagery) about a young woman coming of age.

Some things to watch for:
- Cinderella's birds
- the horse that moves backwards
- ""Milky White,"" especially after the baker gets tired of leading(dragging) her, and picks her up by the handle on her top
- the stepmother cutting off her daughter's heel and then picking it up by stabbing it with the knife like a piece of ham
- ""Agony"" by the two princes
- ""No One Is Alone""
- and lastly, ""Your Fault.""

It's also worth mentioning that the lighthearted fun in the first act is matched perfectly with the dark and sober mood in the second act, although it may be a little heavy for young children.

Mentionable quotes:
""I don't like that woman!"" - The Baker, about the Witch
""I was raised to be charming, not sincere."" - Cinderella's prince
""I was just trying to be a good mother."" - The Witch to Rapunzel
""Slotted spoons don't hold much soup."" - Jack's mother
""There are times I do actually enjoy cleaning."" - Cinderella
""You can talk to birds...?"" - Little Red Riding Hood to Cinderella
""...some of us don't like the way you've been telling it..."" - The Witch to the narrator, just before she sacrifices him to the giant

That said, I'll indulge myself with a few trifling criticisms. Bernadette Peters sings well enough but she frequently panders to her ""theatrical"" fan base with campy line readings that may be good for a cheap laugh but instantly propel me out of the story.

922013,4,6304681372,"I have been a big fan of Into The Woods for about ten years now.  It is one musical that I certainly would like to perform in someday.  My introduction to the play was the Great Performances VHS, which I gather is the same video as the DVD.
  In reading the reviews for this DVD, I was happy to see the jubillant raves, but was dissapointed in reading the review with only one star.  I want to clarify someting to the web-audience.
  There is a point to this play.  The fairy tale characters are not introduced in order to be killed off in the second act.  Every character has to face the dark, dismal, dreary realm of the woods.  In fairy tales, the woods are always depicted as scary places that seem to have a life of their own.  This feeling of forests are still present in more modern tales like The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow.
  In the woods, the characters are filled with fear.  The woods is an obstacle that the fairy tale characters have to overcome in order to mature.  Each one in this musical have different motives to go into the woods, but to all of them, they are facing their deepest fears, their beasts. Once the characters enter the woods, they find that it isn't too bad, and they achieve their goals in hopes that they don't have to go to the woods again, but they do.  We will always have monsters that we have to face, but we have to be strong and persevere.  That is the main theme of the play.  This theme is obvious, but very deep and profound.  In response to the reviewer from Florida, I want to make a point that the story in this musical is more profound than anything in Shrek.  I enjoyed Shrek just as much as everyone in the world did, but it was predictable compared to the second act in Into The Woods.  The dialogue was witty in Shreck, but even wittier in Into The Woods.  I recomend this musical highly, and I suggest you give it another try.  Look beyond the first act and the fact that many characters die, and you will find morals that are deep and non-existent in any Hollywood- fare film.",1007856000,4,2028,4.278947368421052

The basic story is that of all the wonderfull fairy tales intertwined with one another revolving around a baker and his wife. While it is familiar to everyone, don't buy it for kids younger than ten because the second act is a much darker story which younger kids might get frightened by. Also, if you are an adult, don't be afraid it will be too immature for your liking. Many of the jokes are specifically adult humor and adults will appreciate the real tone of the musical (life isn't like a fairy tale: While things sometimes turn out happily in the end, not all things do.)
This musical is played out by an exceptional cast. Bernadetter Peters is the witch and her witty portrayal of the character is one of the show's best aspects. As well as being a great person to portray the with, Peters' wonderful voice make songs such as ""Last Midnight"" delightful to listen to.

Many of the tune from the show are familiar, having been sung by many artists on various albums.  They somehow never managed to capture the true emotion.  That can only come when you have made that journey into the woods yourself.
To describe it as an adult fairy tale seem a little trite.  However after the frist fifteen minutes the viewer is locked into the plot as each of the characters have to go into the woods for a variety of reasons.  All of them have a different reason to enter the woods but all of them in some way are looking for success and beauty.  By the end of the first act they have received all that their hearts desire.....at a price and plan to live happily ever after.
This dream of living happily ever after is stripped away from them during the second act and all the prizes they had achieved through the challenges of getting in to the woods in the first act are 'lost'.  This leaves them with something less tangible as their reward.  They no longer have their gold or their beauty but they realise that they have something worth so much more that money can buy.
To enjoy this magnificant performance from all the cast ensure that you have a drink by your side and have un-plugged the 'phone.  Sit yourself down preferable in a dark room and allow yourself to be drawn into this journey through the woods.  You will re-capture the innocence of being a child once again....only to find that being an adult can be just as much fun.
If you have never watched Sondheims work, this is a great one to start with before moving onto the more macabre Sweeney Todd or over arty Sunday in the Park.
I even managed to get my partner to watch it from start to end in silence...he has since been caught watchng it alone on more than one occassion!
It isn't religion, but it does give you a sense of what is good and what is evil....and you will be searching for the soundtrack to play in the car on those long journeys and you will find that you start to sing each role as you make your way through the rush hour traffick.
Ps If like me you can't sing, make sure the windows are up in the car!

922100,5,6304681372,"This is truly an amazing play. It's rare that a single piece of work (be it a play, a movie, a book) can make you feel such a wide range of emotions. Into the Woods, if nothing else, does make you laugh. As, especially in the first half, there are many hilairous moments. Agony, a song that the two princes of the play sing about their loves, is a perfect mix between romantic conquest and egotistical self involvment. However, in the second act things get darker and you realize that going ""into the woods"" is a complex metaphor. The final song of the play, Children will Listen, is incredibly profound and could easily bring tears to your eyes, only seconds before the whole cast once again starts joyfully singing the exciting Into the Woods. The cast is excellent all around. The most notable would have to be Cinderella's prince, the baker's wife and (obviously) Bernadette Peters as the witch. Cinderella's prince is the pinnacle of every stereotype about princes and, at the same time, is unaware of his huge ego. He gets some of the best lines from James Lapine as well (""I was brought up to be charming, not sincere""). Joanna Gleason very much deserved her Tony as she gave the Baker's Wife cunningness, romance, and depth. However, it is Bernadette Peters who steals the show as the wicked witch. Every time she is on stage she simply embodies the character. Her entrance is as spectacular as it should be, as she sings the incredible ""Witch's Rap"" reeling off words faster than you can imagine while retaining a  brilliant sense of character. On the other end of the spectrum, later on in ""The Last Midnight"" she not only demonstrates her amazing vocal abilities but gives a dramatic powerhouse of a performance that makes you discover who the witch really is. Of course, it is the great Sondheim who we should really thank for this. The line in the last midnight: ""You're not good, you're not bad you're just nice, I'm not good, I'm not nice, I'm just RIGHT!"" says so much when you think about it. This show is more accessable than most Sondheim productions and the majority of the first act is simply an entertaining and exciting story that perfectly intertwines all the fairy tales. But this is a Sondheim show. There is always something more serious behind the lines and certain points have some more racy meanings (""Hello Little Girl"", a song that the wolf sings to little red riding hood, has an unmistakibly sexual undertone). Still, this is a delightful and thought provoking show that also manages to be incredibly entertaining. All of the leads deliver showcase performances and, well, this is just about as good as it gets. Anyone who thinks they hate Steven Sondheim: I defy you to get nothing out of the spectacular Into the Woods.",984268800,15,2755,4.703933747412008
922101,5,6304681372,"Stephen Sondheim's ""Into The Woods"" is my favorite musical of all time. Years ago I viewed this presentation of the Broadway cast on PBS's American Playhouse. For years I looked for it on video tape in vain. When it finally was released, it was like manna from heaven. It is a mixture of a talented cast (featuring Bernadette Peters,Chip Zien, and Joanna Gleason), an amazing  Stephen Sonheim score (""Children Will Listen"", ""No One is Alone"")and a both comical and touching book by James Lapine. It takes our notions of what fairy tales are suppose to be like and turns them on thier heads. This musical attempts to answer the question ""So, what happened after the happily ever after?""",982627200,,685,4.805084745762712
922102,5,6304681372,"With all of the triteness of ""Phantom of the Opera"" crazing the nation today, ""Into the Woods"" is a breath of fresh air.  This timeless tale, debuted in 1987, and won the Tony for Best Musical and Best Actress (Joanna Gleason).
Sondheim's score weeps in ""Stay a Child"", growls in ""Hello Little Girl"", and dances in the main theme ""Into the Woods"".
Spectacular performances from Bernadette Peters as the witch, Chip Zien as the baker, Danielle McFerland as Little Red Riding Hood, Chris Groenendahl as Cinderella's Prince, Kim Crosby as Cinderella, and Tony-winner Joanna Gleason as the baker's wife.

922104,5,6304681372,"On the surface it sounds silly and simplistic: Cinderella and her Prince, Little Red Ridinghood, her Granny and The Wolf, Jack and his Beanstalk, Rupunzel, a Witch, a Baker and his Wife all come together in an enchanted wood to play out their famous stories...and then we get to see what happened AFTER the ""happily ever after.""  But ""Into the Woods"" is anything but silly or simplistic.  It is one of Sondheim's funniest and cleverest scores and this DVD version blessedly captures the sterling performances of the original Broadway cast headed by the incomparable Bernadette Peters, Chip Zien and Tony Award winner Joanna Gleason as the Baker's Wife.  Sondheim and James Lapine dig deep and make us take a look at the consequences of getting what we wish for, since there truly is a price for everything, and the ""ripple effect"" of our desires touch the world in ways we may never imagine.  It is also a musical about accepting loss and moving forward (a common theme in Sondheim scores, but one eloquently explored here in heartfelt numbers such as ""Children Will Listen"" and ""No One Is Alone."").  As an entertainment, you will get more than your money's worth, and along the way, you may learn a thing or two about yourself and your world.  I have seen this show about a dozen times and learn something new each time.  If you are a Sondheim novice, this would be a wonderful introductory show before jumping into the more complex pieces like ""Sweeney Todd,"" ""Assassins,"" or ""Passion.""",980121600,11,1488,4.7890625
922105,5,6304681372,"Into the Woods is an outstanding musical combining genres, plots and amazing talents into a cohesive, highly entertaining, theatrical show. The basic plot has been discussed by other reviewers. What stands out for me about this DVD is that Sondheim and Lapine have created a musical farce, the action is witty and quick, the laughs piling up ontop of each other. The action and interaction between some of the major fairy tale characters moves at a fast pace through the first act. They play out the stories we have known since childhood, but Sondheim's music and Lapine's direction pushes the stories we know so well into completely new directions.
We know Cinderella, Jack, Prince Charming, Little Red Riding Hood, the Witch, the Baker and the Baker's Wife but Sondheim and Lapine give them new voices and surprised me in the process. You become aware of the complexity of life's journies through the use of archetypal plots from the fairy stories. That is what is so brilliant about this show. It goes beyond just being a musical farce to being a sharp comment on childhood and the responsibilities of adulthood. Beyond a retelling of old fairy stories to a deeper idea that we are all mixed up in journies of our own.
This is made clear in the darker, sad second act. But through the darkness there is hope that the journey was worth every second. I love this show! Laughing so hard one minute and the next, sobbing! The idea is intruiging and it works!
Those of the cast who stand out for me are Bernadette Peters, Joanna Gleason and Robert Westenberg. Their comic timing is spot on as well as their understanding that there is more than the comedy that completes this musical. Sondheim's music and songs are mostly short and precise and they stay with you. Lapine's direction is fast and tight. The rest of the cast is excellent, without a weak link, so every scene is a joy to watch.
If you are a fan of the musical, or new to Sondheim, as I was when I first saw Into the Woods, then this DVD is for you. The quality of filming the stage production, is excellent. You don't miss a thing. The only down side about this DVD version is that it has no extra features of any significance like a commentry that can be found on SUNDAY IN THE PARK WITH GEORGE. This I found to be the only flaw on an otherwise perfect DVD.",977097600,4,2321,4.5285714285714285
922206,5,6304681372,"This is a video you can't afford to miss.  As with Sunday in the park... Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine take it away again.  It has parts that made me cry, like No One Is Alone, and lines to make you laugh, such as the line spoken by Cinderella's Prince, ""I was raised to be charming, not sincere.""  The cast is amazing, but the best actress in the show was Bernadette Peters.  She brings the witch to life, and I found myself forgetting where I was because I was so wrapped up in it.  This is one of the best musicals brought to the silver screen.  Add this one to your collection as soon as you can!",973641600,2,604,4.119658119658119
922207,5,6304681372,"Into The Woods is at all times humorous, sad, disturbing, and thought-provoking. It is enjoyable by all ages. Children will find it to be a delightful twist on conventional fairy tales, and Adults will find it thought-provoking and moving, as well as a delightful romp through childhood stories. Despite what people may say, the second act does not drag; it is merely less fairy-tale-ish compared to the first act, as the characters keep getting killed off. It is a bit less subtle than some of Sondheim's other shows, which may irk some of the fans devoted to Sunday in the Park With George or Assasins (which I also recommend), but newcomers to Sondheim will find it to be a very easily enjoyed and accesible play. With melodic tunes and clever, moving, and thoughtful lyrics and book, and exceptional performances by Joanna Gleason, Chip Zien, and Bernadette Peters (this is a must for any of her fans), Into the Woods is and will remain a Broadway classic.",971913600,71,960,4.789156626506024
922208,5,6304681372,"In the 1980s, Bernadette Peters established her reputation as the Queen of Broadway.  Into the Woods, a Stephen Sondheim musical, was one of her great triumphs.  This musical is an allegory on the numerous themes we see in fairy tales; it also combines several well-known tales into a cohesive whole (Jack and the Beanstalk, Rapunzel, Cinderella, etc.).  As a musical, there are a lot of songs, most very cleverly written and some of them even hummable for the general audience.  The musical has a lot of amusing moments and is quite enjoyable in all.
The overall plotline is a little complex, but basically, it follows the general storyline of the above fairy tales to their conclusion, as accompanied by the smart Sondheim songs (he also wrote for West Side Story, Gypsy, and Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, in case you didn't know).  However, that is only the first half of the play.  The first half has more tunes and is more amusing.  The second half, however, shows the consequences of what has transpired from the completed fairy tales.  In a sense, it continues the storyline before the EVER AFTER (which is one of the names of the songs, by the way).  The second half, then, is the more serious of the two.  In fact, it's rather a bit of a downer after such a fun first half.  Nonetheless, it still has a few memorable tunes, such as No One is Alone.
Bernadette Peters has a role as a witch in the musical.  Also of note is Joanna Gleason, who won a best actress Tony Award for her amusing role as the baker's wife.  Everyone sings well, especially these two actresses.  The musical also garnered two more Tonys  for best score and best book.
Just a few words on the DVD, which I bought.  This is essentially the broadcast version of the live musical, as shown several years back on PBS.  The picture quality is decent, and the PCM (not dolby digital) sound quality is okay, too, considering this was from a TV broadcast.  There are no extras at all on the DVD, unfortunately, although the musical does run for over 2 and  hours, and there are a generous number of bookmarks so you can easily access your favorite song.  Bottom line - this is a very good Broadway musical and certainly worth viewing.  The DVD transfer is acceptable, though a few extras, like cast notes or maybe even subtitles for sing-alongs would have been appreciated.  Still, I can safely recommend this DVD!",971222400,5,2403,4.591549295774648

The stage is set up in a functional way, and each character is seen and heard from individually.  As the show  progresses, the tales all mesh as one, but the main focus is on the Baker  and his wife.  They were cursed by their Witch neighbor, the awe-inspiring  Bernadette Peters, for something the Baker's father did years ago.  They  need to collect, a cow as white as milk, a cape as red as blood, a slipper  of pure gold and hair as yellow as corn if they ever want to have a child.  The cow comes from the tale, ""Jack and the Beanstalk"", the cape  comes from, ""Little Red Riding Hood"", the slipper from,  ""Cinderella"", and the hair from, ""Rapunzel"".  The Witch  is turned back into her beautiful self, once this potion is concocted, the  Baker and his wife have a child, and they all live happily ever after--  until Act Two!
  Act Two opens similarly to Act One.  The characters  all tell about their new lives, and the new problems that go with it.  The  whole village is shaken when a giant is scouring the land for the murderer  of her husband.  If you recall, ""Jack and the Beanstalk"", the  murderer is Jack.  The villagers want to save Jack, but the Witch knows  that the giant will stop at nothing to get the guilty party, even if it  means destroying the whole village!  As the Witch so appropriately says,  ""You're so nice!  You're not good, you're not bad.  You're just nice.  I'm not good, I'm not nice, I'm just right!  I'm the Witch!  You're the  world!""

Unlike my video  tape version, it's great to be able to skip to a particular song I wish to  view.
INTO THE WOODS is such a great show.  The first act is hilarious  and witty.  It very smartly weaves together all those fairy tales so  familiar to us all.  Then act two makes us look at them through adult eyes.  I think Sondheim and Lapine are telling us that in fairy tales as well as  ""real"" life, the simple words ""I wish..."" are truly the  beginning of whatever story each of us is about to tell.  They counsel us  to be careful of what we wish in life -- our wishes effect everyone.
My  favorite song in this production is ""The Last Midnight"" which is  performed by Bernadette Peters as the Witch.  It is very macabre and  Sondheim reveals so much about the Witch's character through the lyrics.  Plus, it gives Ms. Peters an opportunity to belt!

She tells the story of the curse in a rap like song. In  doing this they meet a spunky Little Red Riding Hood, who is being pursued  by the Big Bad Wolf, Jack (of Beanstalk fame), Rapunzel, and Cinderella.  Humor and tears highlight this musical by Sondheim. The song,  ""Children Will Listen,"" spreads the message of the play, which is  that everyone must be careful and learn and face up to life's tragedies.  Here is a snippet of it:
Careful the wish you make, wishes are children.  Careful the path they take, wishes come true. Not free. No one is  alone.
Filled with humor and magic, INTO THE WOODS is told by The  Narrator, who gets fed to the Giant's wife in the second act. The Witch's  love for Rapunzel is illustrated in the song, STAY WITH ME:

922439,5,6304681372,"Absolutley nothing compares to this musical.  It's one of those rare finds that appeals to every single age.  It's funny with a few dramatic moments, and a few lessons.  I totally recommend that everyone see Into the Woods.  Bernadette Peters is wonderful.",939945600,,256,5.023809523809524
922501,5,6304681372,"Yes, I'm using the word ""fabulous""!  It is no exageration to say that ""Into the Woods"" is one of the greatest musicals ever.  Quite simply one of Sondheim's finest scores, the music varies from  whimsical(Prologue,On the Steps of the Palace) to haunting(Your Fault, Last  Midnight) to just lovely(No One Is Alone).  One must not overlook James  Lapine's book which is brilliant; it can be deep and touching one minute  than sudden explode into utter hilarity.  There is a wonderful assembly of  talent in the cast.  It goes without saying that Bernadette Peters is  absolutely fabulous and Joanne Gleason gives a wonderful performance as the  Baker's Wife.  But I would like to draw everyones attention to Chip Zien's  performance as the Baker.  When I first saw this tape, the moment of my  highest emotional connection to the show was when he sang the wonderful  ballad ""No More"".  I am always on the verge of tears during that  scene.  This video is definetly a must to anyone who likes theatre.  It is  wonderfully shot with creative camera angles that bring the viewer into the  action.  It's how we wish we could see all live theatre.  If there were any  higher rating than five stars, this would get it.  All this can be said in  one word: Fabulous!",935366400,,1256,4.716279069767442
922502,5,6304681372,"This is I have to say the BEST musical I've ever seen, but not ony that, as you already probably read the performances are exquisite and over the top, but the VIDEO EDITION and the sound are EXCELLENT as well, it's not  just an open shot of the theatre, and its not a bunch of closeups that  doesn't let you see the full scene. And to top thigs off, Stephen  Sondheim's music and lyrics are almost Shakespeare level, you HAVE to BUY  THIS!!!!",933811200,,442,4.289156626506024

922504,5,6304681372,"Since this play was aired on PBS years ago, my daughter and I have loved it!  When she was little she learned from this play why I never approved of the tales ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" and ""Goldilocks and the 3  Bears"" (even tho Goldilocks isn't in the play the message is the  same).  It's The Last Midnight is the best song second only to Children  Will Listen.
Bernadette Peters performance is, as expect, fun and  powerful.  And I'd only known of JoAnna Gleason from TV and movies before  this.  I am glad to know that she's such a powerful singer and actress.",924912000,,563,4.388349514563107
