8013179,5,B0001IN0SA,"Got 'The Legends of the Old West a couple of months ago, I grew up watching westerns. These are great & quality also great. Jim Davis plays the Railroad Detective along with his lady partners, 2 different ladies depending on episode. These are based on true stories from the 1800's to the 1900's. Some towns then, Santa Clarita, Ca., Visalia, Ca., San Antonio, Tx., etc. When my husband was drivng down the highway right by Santa Clarita, Ca., he told me that many years ago, before the cities exsisted, outlaws on horseback would hide between the rocks from the law(Sheriff's or Rangers). I couldn't believe I was looking at all size of rocks used to hide during the pioneer/western times. These films are history & the actors are good. Not in color, but that was life then. Jim davis narrated at beginning & at end, but it all happened & I checked on google, sure was. I also got '26 Men', also based on actual history of the Arizona Rangers that made it possible for the Arizona Territory to become a state. Excellent prices worth watching our history before us. Very nice & peppy song of '26 Men' sung before & after each episode. Tried getting a cd with song, not found it yet. These are good to teach anyone about our history. It was sure worth getting it, I have seen them more than once.",1248307200,5,1295,4.491525423728813
