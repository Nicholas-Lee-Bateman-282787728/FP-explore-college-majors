7850021,3,6303562191,It was not done in SP  Format.  It was recorded in Extra Play Format.  It would have been a higher quality recording if recorded in SP Format.,1336780800,,142,4.185185185185185
7850022,1,6303562191,"I gave this movie one star because there is nothing lower.  The movie is standing joke in my family as the worst movie ever made. It ranks down there with Carnisaur, but worse. I would buy a copy if in DVD just as a joke to play on my kids.  You owe it to yourself to see the worst movie ever made. Laughably bad!",1314748800,,313,3.875
7850023,4,6303562191,"This is a good movie, if not a great one. I give it four stars because the movie means something to me personally. I worked on this film, as an uncredited production assistant (a/k/a ""go-fer"") during filming in the summer of 1983. Most of the filming took place west of Las Cruces, NM, near Picacho Peak, but the death scene of one of the runners (Art Hindle) was filmed at White Sands National Monument.
The story line is this: Three long distance runners team up to run 70 miles across the New Mexico desert, finishing their run at the town of Glory, New Mexico, as part of the town's Pioneer Days celebration. On the first day of their run, they are ambushed and captured by a band of militaristic survivalists (""the Citizen's Brigade, out of Denver,"" as Col. Crouse informs the runners). The runners are stunned and relieved to find out that it was all just an exercise, and the Colonel says ""Now, let me buy you a beer!"" There's a couple of minutes of good natured banter, before things turn ugly when one of the runners ridicules them for hazing a female member of their group.
The runners are released, and go on their way, but are soon attacked by some of the survivalists, led by Col. Crouse's screw-up son, Sonny. Swinging a pair of binoculars like a mace and chain, Sonny connects with the temple of one of the runners, killing him. Stunned by this turn of events, the survivalist band rides off on motorcycles.
It gets pretty predictable from there. The survivalist band decides they have to kill the other two runners, before they can report to the authorities, and the chase is on.
I think it is important to note that the survivalists did NOT have firearms in this movie. They were on a training mission, and didn't bring firearms, which is fortunate for our heroes.
This movie is well worth watching, at least once. For me, it brought back memories of working in the desert, in 110 degree heat, but it was a lot of fun.",1301529600,3,1935,4.515669515669516
7850024,4,6303562191,For the life of me i cant understand why this movie has never seen the light of day on DVD. One of the better Deliverance/The Hitcher/Southern Comfort style movies with a unique story and good cast. Brutal and unrelenting until the end.,1249344000,,236,4.642857142857143
