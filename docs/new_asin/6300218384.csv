Nesmith really is a talented guy,not just with music but comedy as well. Television Parts has some great bits.",1497744000,,279,4.384615384615385
7806353,5,6300218384,"!I wish this would be made available on DVD. Short skits and music videos with a good dose of 80s humor. I had forgotten that Jack Handy from SNL started his unique style of humor on Television Parts. This is not as polished as Elephant Parts, but still great fun if you remember the 80s. Even though this is from Nesmith's post-Monkees era, it is a must see for Monkees fans!",1425081600,,376,4.309859154929577
7806354,5,6300218384,"SEE MY REVIEW ON ""Elephant Parts"" ALSO BY MICHAEL NESMITH (circa early 1980's).  This is another ""before its time"" Music/Video Production by the creative genius behind the Monkees (1960's) and continues the legacy of his hilarious and wonderful masterpiece, ""Elephant Parts.""  Television Parts Home Companion is a must see addition to everyone's Home Video Collectionl.  Buy it now, put it in, sit back and get ready to fall of your couch/chair LAUGHING..... Michael Nesmith is just brilliant.... beyond reproach....",1413331200,,516,5.506329113924051
7806355,5,6300218384,"Very nice quality and on-time delivery was appreciated.  I like this DVD.  Funny.  Not as good as the regular show television parts, but good to own and watch.",1357603200,,159,4.607142857142857
7806356,5,6300218384,"I wish the entire show were available, but at least we have these excerpts to remind us of a better time, and a better man.  <3 Michael Nesmith!",1352505600,,144,4.142857142857143
7806357,4,6300218384,"When I reviewed the Michael Nesmith CD/DVD compilation&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pacific-Arts-Music-Videos-from-Videoranch/dp/B001BVAQWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pacific Arts: Music & Videos from Videoranch</a>, I was disappointed that the videos for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Newer-Stuff/dp/B0002DB5PY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Newer Stuff</a>-era tracks, ""Eldorado To The Moon"" and ""Chow Mein and Bowling,"" were not included on that release's bonus DVD.

Well, lo and behold, TELEVISION PARTS HOME COMPANION not only has those two videos, but also the ones for two other NEWER STUFF/PACIFIC ARTS songs, ""I'll Remember You"" (my favorite) and ""Total Control,"" which plays over the end credits.  The rest of the video consists of short comedy vignettes from the short-lived NBC-TV series, MICHAEL NESMITH IN TELEVISION PARTS, and a few others that were new to video in 1985.

Overall, I liked this DVD better than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elephant-Parts/dp/B0019BMOLW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elephant Parts</a>; while the sketches are not ROTFLMAO funny, they are amusing.  You can also play the music videos in isolation, which you cannot do with ELEPHANT PARTS; you need the PACIFIC ARTS CD/DVD for that.

I don't know if the original TELEVISION PARTS series will ever be released on DVD; Michael apparently intended this video as a substitute, unless legal issues with NBCUniversal Comcast have prevented the release of the original series. Of course, that series was only on for a year, so there may not be that much extra material available.",1339200000,,1707,6.776255707762557
7806358,5,6300218384,"Loved this DVD! It's a showcase of Michael Nesmith's great talent and creative genius! Wish the original ""Television Parts"" would be released on DVD!! ""Home Companion"" follows on where the original leaves off.",1264809600,3,209,5.363636363636363
7806359,4,6300218384,"Back in 1980, former Monkees member Micheal Nesmith had a great idea-- to do a ""video album"" of songs and sketches; that idea became 1981's ""Elephant Parts"" the first video release to win a ""Video Of The Year"" Grammy. Several years after the success of that Video, Nesmith and director William Dear were approached to do a summer replacement series, NBC TV's 1986 ""Television Parts."" This tape, ""Television Parts Home Companion"" is a short (40 min) compilation from several of those episodes. It's very funny, but the ""Dr. Duck's Super-Secret All-Purpose Sauce"" compilation of those same shows from 1987 is much better.",1259539200,3,619,5.078431372549019
7806360,5,6300218384,It is too bad more comedy is not this good. Very subtle!? well maybe not but great just the same.,1236124800,,97,3.9
