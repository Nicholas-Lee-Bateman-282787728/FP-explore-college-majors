I loved every aspect of this show. Advertising junkies will appreciate the actual infusion of ad/marketing strategy and campaign development. I appreciate the constant struggle Creative Director Mason has, trying to balance his dedication to career and family. Eric McCormack and Tom Cavanagh embody lovable characters you can't help but root for, even in their worst, most shameful moments. I can't wait to get my hands on this DVD!!",1250726400,4,585,5.168421052631579

8519376,5,B001OQCVDI,"Just watched the season finale of ""Trust Me"", then decided to do a web search on the chances it would be coming back for a second season.  As I discovered, TNT has given it a pass.  Very sad.

But, this has happened too many times to me to get too bunged up over it, and it will certainly happen again.  So let's just focus on the good stuff.  At least you, you lucky dogs, have a whole season of the show on DVD to enjoy!  And if you're like me, you really, really will.

I've been a fanatic for Tom Cavanagh ever since ""Ed"" hit NBC (will someone PLEASE put that damned show on DVD?!!), and when I heard they were pairing him in a new show with Eric McCormack, I was instantly sold.  Two of my favorite comedy actors in the same show - AND I came to find out that Griffin Dunne (he who had many awesome jobs in the 80s) was in it, too.  Sold!

I loved the show from the first episode, and it only got better as it went along.  The writing was SUCH a pleasure!  These characters were fantastic, the chemistry between them was delicious (I don't throw that word around often, either...), the setting was compelling (love getting to see the ins and outs of the modern advertising world), and, remarkably, it was a show seemingly created for GROWN-UPS!  That is, it didn't talk down to me, it took its time, it cared about little moments between people as much, if not more, than whatever the supposed A-story was supposed to be that week.  It became the favorite part of my TV week.

The surprise of the show for me was cast member Monica Potter.  I'd only ever seen her in a couple of things - like, ten years ago - and didn't hold much of an opinion about her.  All I'd really seen her do was sit there and look worried for Nicholas Cage.  And suddenly, ten years later and no longer a fresh-faced young US Magazine cover girl, she shows up as this really wonderful actress, playing one of the most unique (and brilliantly annoying) TV characters I've seen in years.  I showed up at ""Trust Me"" for the guys, but Monica ended up being one of the main reasons to hang around.

Funny, inspiring, dramatic, surprisingly suspenseful, thought-provoking and smile-inducing, ""Trust Me"" is thirteen episodes of rare television gold that you owe it to yourself to try.  If you're like me, you'll be glad that you did.  Dare I say...trust me?...on this one?",1239580800,13,2346,4.369515011547344
