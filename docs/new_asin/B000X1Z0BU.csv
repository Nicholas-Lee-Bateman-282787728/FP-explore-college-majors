2996502,5,B000X1Z0BU,"This is one of those rare movies that defies any neat classification.  It isn't a traditional love story by any stretch.  Though it is filled with music from beginning to end it isn't really a musical.  In the traditional musical characters will suddenly burst into song but it represented an interruption in the otherwise semi-realistic tone of the movie--think of Gene Kelly in SINGIN' IN THE RAIN.  But all the songs in this film are in line with the overall realism of the film, they are all songs that occur in normal life.

I don't want to reveal much in the way of details about the movie since much of the joy of the film is discovering the ways it defies expectations.  In broad outline it is about a street singer who has put his emotional life on cold storage because of a broken heart and the woman he meets who helps him open himself back up to life.  During the day in Dublin he sings familiar standards for tips but at night, when the crowds thin out, he sings his own original material.  We see him this way for the first time through the eyes of the Girl as she first meets him (in the credits the two lead characters, never addressed by name, are listed as Guy and Girl).  He, played by Frames' frontman Glen Hansard, is singing an absolutely stunning song with intense passion.  As he finishes, the camera pulls back to reveal her standing there.  From thenceforward we see the two of them get to know each other as they perform a string of amazing songs together.

Neither Glen Hansard nor Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute; is a professional actor.  Hansard did have a prominent role in another great Dublin film about music, THE COMMITMENTS.  In that one Hansard played the band's guitarist Outspan Foster, one of the two original members of the band (he is the one who resists the suggestion of the other original member to call their band A Flock of Budgies).  In real life, of course, Hansard has long been the resident genius of the great Irish rock band The Frames and both one of the great singers in rock as well as an absolutely brilliant songwriter (neither of which anyone who sees this movie will be inclined to doubt).  While visiting Prague a couple of years back he met a precocious teenager who was none other than Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute;. One thing led to another and within a year of their meeting they recorded and album together entitled THE SWELL SEASON.  Next they appeared in this film by John Carney, himself a former member of The Frames.  So their time together has been amazingly productive (she also appeared on the critically acclaimed new album by the Frames, THE COST).

The film is filled with wonderful little moments, like the first meeting (driven by Hansard's magnificent performance of ""Say It To Me Now"").  Or the way the sound engineer recording the Guy's song goes from disinterest to interest as he realizes just how good he is.  Or the marvelous extended shot that follows the Girl from a convenience store where she has bought batteries for a CD player down the street for a few blocks as she sings the lyrics she has written for a song the Guy has written the music for.

This truly is a very special film.  It does not have the greatest production values; indeed, it feels like the low budget that it is.  It works because the two leads, while not professional actors, have a wonderful chemistry both romantically and musically and because Glen Hansard is one of the finest songwriters around.  In fact, the soundtrack for the film has to go down as one of the greatest soundtracks ever released.  I would urge anyone who loves the music in this film to investigate not merely the soundtrack for the film, but both THE SWELL SEASON, the album by Glen Hansard and Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute;, and two albums by the Frames, FITZCARRALDO and THE COST.

Update 8/8/07

I just read today on IMDB.com that Twentieth Century Fox, which owns the distribution rights to the movie, has been so pleased with its performance so far - nearly $7 million in box office on only 140 screens - that they are going to release it to a much larger number of screens and give it a publicity push.  Obviously this means that this gem will be granted a much larger audience.  Hopefully it will garner the kind of acclaim it deserves.",1181347200,241,4278,4.612945838837517
2996503,5,B000X1Z0BU,"This low budget ($200,000) film has won uniformly rave reviews, not to mention the 2007 audience award at the Sundance Film Festival. The plot is about as simple as plot can get. An aspiring street musician whose girlfriend left him for London lives above his father's vacuum cleaner repair shop. A younger girl who has moved to Dublin from the Czech Republic after her husband left her hears him play and becomes his motivating inspiration. Their tender friendship is mediated by their mutual love for music, and many people have referred to this film as a musical, what with a dozen or so songs that move the story along. Best of all is a surprise and decidedly ambiguous ending. Actors Glen Hansard of the Dublin-based group The Frames and the Czech singer-songwriter Marketa Irglova (age 17) sing their own songs in this feel-good flick.",1180828800,7,841,4.847222222222222
2996504,5,B000X1Z0BU,"""Once"" is a real find. The story of a street musician who meets a Czech migr on the streets of downtown Dublin, is a believable, well-made film about love, dreams and making things happen.

Guy (Glen Hansard, a real musician who also appeared in the film ""The Commitments""), a street busker who sings his heart out on the streets of Dublin, works in his dad's vacuum repair shop. One day, a young lady (Marketa Irglova), a Czech immigrant, begins to ask him questions about his music, his passions, the inspiration for his ballads. They form a friendship and she encourages him to follow his dream and put together a demo album. As the friendship grows, she helps him negotiate a recording studio and practice the songs. In the process, she invites him into her home, to meet her mother and young daughter. During the course of their relationship, they grow closer, but she is still married and can't let anything happen. They round up some other musicians and begin to work on the demo, to help him with his dream.

""Once"", written and directed by John Carney, is a very intimate look at the relationship between these two people. A lot of handheld camera work, close shots and grungy, real locations help to give the film an incredible cinema verite look and style. The camera work is handheld, but not overly shaky, creating shots with an intimate, close appearance, really thrusting us into the middle of the action.

The relationship between Guy and Girl (as they are listed in the credits) is really an interesting one that draws you into their lives. Initially, the guy is a bit put off by the girl, she is extremely chatty and forthcoming, asking him a lot of questions about his music, why he sings certain songs, the inspiration, etc. As a street musician, he is naturally a little weary about people getting too close, he simply wants them to enjoy a little of the music and drop a couple of coins or bills into his guitar case and leave. So, the young woman who stops to ask questions, in her accented English, is a minor annoyance, until he realizes she is genuinely interested.

As their relationship grows, he feels a fondness for her, and as a single man, he naturally flirts with her. But when she realizes this is going too far, she gives him a little look, a minor reprimand, and he realizes she is right. They are friends, sharing an experience. And she is married, even if her husband still lives in the Czech Republic and they are having problems.

As they become friends, they become involved in each other's lives. He meets her mother and daughter, sees where she lives, has dinner at their house. She meets his dad and becomes involved in his making of a demo album.

When the duo shows up at the recording studio, with their fellow street musicians, the sound engineer greets them, but secretly reveals his true feelings to someone on his cell phone. He has a feeling this group is another example of people with too much ambition and not enough talent; they don't even know the technical details of recording the music. But when they start playing, he recognizes they have talent, the songs are good, and the lead singer, our guy, is quite good, so he becomes engrossed in making the demo as good as possible. He becomes a part of their team, investing part of himself in the production of the demo.

Part of the beauty of ""Once"" is that nothing seems forced. They don't have sex, simply to make the story more dramatic. In fact, the course of their relationship seems all the more real because they simply remain friends, close friends invested in each other's lives and livelihood. There aren't any manufactured crises involving her mother and baby or his dad. They simply struggle with real life.

Also, the music is quite good throughout the film. Guy sings a song, a love ballad he wrote for his girlfriend who moved away to London, a few times, each time making it a little better. Finally, when they record it for the demo, it is as good as it could be, with the girl playing keyboard and singing backup and the addition of the other musicians they have recruited.

""Once"" is a film about the guy following his dream. He wants to make a demo and travel to London, to try to get a contract. But perhaps more importantly, he wants to reunite with his girlfriend. All he needs is a little push, a little support and guidance from a friend. He finds that friendship with the girl, his new friend who helps him realize he should go for his dream.",1180569600,109,4475,4.5767790262172285
2996505,5,B000X1Z0BU,"Saw the movie yesterday, when it opened in our local theater.  Decided this morning that I needed to look for the soundtrack.  Have signed up to be notified when the movie becomes available, because it's that good.

I'm not a movie critic, but this one is good enough that I want to encourage other folks to see it.  It's hard to explain the reasoning without giving too much detail about the story, or building it up too much.  But here's what I can say :

During the movie, I recognized that I was waiting for some tragic event (my wife said as we left the theater that she kept waiting for one of them to die), because that's what would happen in a standard Hollywood movie.  How sad that we've grown accustomed to movies that must throw big tragic events at us to create emotional responses because the acting, storywriting, and character development cannot suffice to make us feel emotions on a small scale.

In ""Once"", the acting and the story (and the music) develop the characters well enough, and tell a story that is plausible enough, that an ordinary tragedy is sufficient to make the viewer feel genuine and complex emotion.  All without trying too hard or backing away from it.  That's brilliant.  Worth seeing more than once, which is why I want to own it.",1180224000,9,1270,4.5506607929515415
2996506,4,B000X1Z0BU,"Splendid, sentamental, charming musical romance with an Irish twist. Set in Dublin without the flashy hollywood glamor or glib quick repartee. Well worth seeing and for ""once"" not long enough.",1180137600,10,192,5.433333333333334
2996507,5,B000X1Z0BU,"I haven't seen ""Music & Lyrics,"" the movie in which Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore play a songwriting-romantic pair, but John Carney's ""Once"" probably can be described as a cross between ""Music & Lyrics"" and ""Brief Encounter."" This delicate little tale of the musical collaboration and almost-romance between a thirtysomething Dublin street busker (Glen Hansard) and a young Czech immigrant to Ireland (Marketa Irglova) leaves us breathless with its simplicity and beauty. There's a certain amount of stylization--this is the movies, after all--but not the kind we're used to from movie musicals. The beautiful, melancholy songs--nearly all of them by Hansard and/or Irglova--arise organically from the characters, because they are musicians, and the songs they write are how they express themselves. Hansard and Irglova both have lovely, impassioned singing voices, and as actors they have a natural, unforced charisma. (Irglova is a first-time actress, but viewers may remember Hansard as Outspan, guitarist for ""The Commitments."") Carney's hand-held cameras give the film a near-documentary feel that nevertheless doesn't skimp on either sentiment or humor. The film's very first scene, depicting Hansard's attempts while busking to keep an obnoxious drunk from stealing his tips, is laugh-out-loud funny while demonstrating the precariousness of Hansard's existence. ""Once"" is that rare musical that envelops us in music and beauty while bringing home the tough reality of the characters' lives.",1180137600,8,1498,5.691964285714286

I watched it because it came so highly recommended, along with Carney's ""Begin Again"" (which I liked a lot), and ""Sing Street"" (which is  one of my favorite movies of all time, and I'm not 30 anymore, or even 50... well, let's not go there..), as well as ""The Commitments"". I have to say I wasn't as enthused as I expected to be, but that was largely because I didn't really like the songs. The premise is charming, and the characters engaging, including the secondary characters (the father, the shop owner, the mother and the friends who come to watch TV, not to mention the Hoover, who develops quite a personality!)",1479686400,5,637,4.539130434782609

A more sophisticated pallet (for movies and music) may be needed to appreciate this movie...I gave it a try because of the good reviews. I played it all the way thru but didn't bother pausing during kitchen or w.c. runs and I don't remember how it ended, just that I was glad it did.",1479513600,,514,4.244897959183674

Maybe it's because I'm an older person, but I found the poor filming to be distracting and most of the music to be repetitive and tiresome.  I think that Markta Irglov's music was beautiful, and I liked the performance of her with Glen Hansard and the band, but Hansard's solo numbers didn't appeal to me at all.

More info: This movie, Once, is a 2007 Irish musical film written and directed by John Carney. Set in Dublin, Ireland, the naturalistic drama stars musicians Glen Hansard and Markta Irglov.

2996700,5,B000X1Z0BU,Great movie.,1444521600,,12,5.5
2996701,1,B000X1Z0BU,"The movie that was assigned to our class, Once, is appropriately titled for once is exactly how many times I will watch it in my lifetime.  The movie started off somewhat interesting as the main character gets robbed and chases the thief down, only to catch him and let him walk away as if nothing even happened.  This act summed up the rest of the movie. Due to the main character being a pusillaminous man, the remainder of the movie was incredibly slow.  As the movie played, I became so bored and disinterested with the characters and their need to play 20 minute songs that I began to wonder if Professor Small was mad at the class, and assigned this movie as a form of punishment.  I also thought about the fact that Amazon users rated this movie a 7.9; which to me is obvious that people were so upset that they wasted an hour and twenty seven minutes of their lives they refused to let this movie rob them of any more time and just not rate or review it.

As the songs played in the movie, I couldn't help but think that the main characters voice sounded similar to that of a wailing man attempting and poorly imitating the voice of a woman who had just gotten over strep throat and smoked a pack of cigarettes before singing.  This movie had me bored and thinking about all of the things wrong that Ive done through the years and balancing whether or not I deserved this punishment.  I am proud to conclude I did not deserve this punishment.  They should play this movie on loop at terrorist detention centers and watch the confessions flood in as prisoners beg for this movie to stop.  This film is simply a drama of two emotionally unavailable characters, who are naturally attracted to one another through their mutual interest in music, as they keep reminding themselves of their previous partners in musical form.  I cant believe this film was actually funded.  The majority of the movie seemed to be shot with a handheld video camera, not for artistic value but simply because the producers saved all of the funding to rent the crane used for the final shot.  Which was also the best shot of the movie, not because of the crane, but because the movie was over.  Thank god (or whatever higher power you believe in) that I don't have to watch this film ever again.  If I were to go on a date, and my date made me sit through this, I would never talk to them again, even if there was a spark between us.  It should be noted that my girlfriend willingly watched this movie with me, which should elevate her to sainthood.

In conclusion, I hated this movie and never want to see it, or anything about it ever again.  I cant believe I spent $3 bucks to rent it.  I wouldve rather donated that $3 to a homeless person so that they could get their next meal, but instead of doing a good deed, I had to stain my eyes with the abomination that is known as the movie called Once.",1444003200,,2883,4.367041198501872
2996702,1,B000X1Z0BU,"I loved Begin Again and this was recommended as similar. I'm shocked and confused by the great reviews this received. It was so awful, I had to stop watching after 15 minutes.

The actors and actresses were no names to me and they were great! I could not give it a five star because I could not see the songs and story meshing together as say ""the sound of music"" and ""singing in the rain"" or others that it would have to stand up to and stand up to the test of time. The great musicals have to strike a strong chord within you and they have to make you feel like a child. This one is more modern and cant really give you that feel.

2996795,1,B000X1Z0BU,"Surprised how bad this was.  It seems an earlier version of ""Begin Again"" (which is FANTASTIC) with a weaker story, poor actors, and much worse music.  Luckily it was less than 90 minutes.",1428537600,2,188,4.666666666666667
2996796,4,B000X1Z0BU,"A refreshingly different film made in Ireland. The unknown actors added to the interest and enjoyment. I wanted to watch this film because I learned it was John Carney's 2007 ""earlier version"" of Begin Again (2014). Being set and made in Ireland ((Dublin), I was fascinated to see it and hear the Glen Hansard music. The romantic story was captivating and the music excellent. I was not disappointed.",1428451200,,400,4.897058823529412

The way it's filmed gives it the same ""raw"" feeling that the characters have. The acting is impeccable. From a writing standpoint, the characters come across clearly without a bunch of unnecessary exposition to tell us about them. We fall in love with them as human beings. This film is humbling.

Although I enjoyed Begin Again more, I can see folks who are truly into music making and relationship and body language, than f-this, f-that of Begin again would enjoy this movie as well. There is a teaser when he asks her, ""do you still love"" (your husband)? and she replied in Czech, purposely un-subtitled, which to me doesn't support the ending, but I will have to watch it again to gain all the nuisances of this movie.",1425081600,,537,4.38
2996823,5,B000X1Z0BU,this is truly one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. It blows me away that they filmed this movie in only 17 days. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves music and independent films.,1424995200,,196,4.324324324324325

It just didn't sound that interesting to me.  After watching it, all I can say is WOW!  Every time I watch the film I get a little choked up. The chemistry between Glen Hansard and Martina is incredible and the music is beautiful.",1424131200,,365,4.484848484848484

2996840,5,B000X1Z0BU,I haven't been this moved by a film about music since Almost Famous. I didn't think another film could do that. What both of those films have in common is that the film makers or writers knew the inner life of music in ways that only one who had really been there could. They knew they walked on holy ground and they told the story with all of the heart and poignancy and stunning revelation that that witnessing leaves in the souls of those who traverse the beautiful territory.,1423267200,,479,4.393258426966292

Once is a smart, well- conceived tale of two struggling musicians in Ireland, and the songs are memorable, beautiful and haunting.

Written and directed by John Carney who did the fabulous movie Begin Again. If you haven't seen it watch it instead. If you have seen Begin Again this one might feel like a let down.

I had the feeling Carney wrote and directed this movie first then took all the things that needed to be improved and created Begin Again. Just watch Begin Again instead.",1418860800,,499,4.413043478260869

He was extra miserable the last four or five weeks before he died...  This film was the only time I saw him relax and really enjoy.  He ENJOYED the story and especially the music.

2996958,5,B000X1Z0BU,"I didn't see this movie when it first came out. I saw it after  seeing ""Begin Again"", as it came up on ""If you like "" Begin Again you'll like"".

I don't know where to begin. I love this movie. It is the sweetest, most beautiful, and emotional film I've seen in years.
I'm a professional musician, and it was so real to me, what Guy goes through, what he's feeling, how he copes by being creative, pouring out himself through his music. I had a lady friend with whom I had a similar relationship to that of Guy and Girl. She was also in the music business and we were in the same performing group. The movie brought back some nice  memories.

Anyway, I've watched the movie twice in five days and the second viewing was as wonderful as the first. I'm a 48 year old man, but I've always had emotional reactions to movies, in other words, I cry at lol.
I'm an old mush, a sap, a forever romantic. This movie really affected me emotionally in a good way. There are so many great moments, and the music is beautiful. I highly recommend ""Once"".",1410393600,,1038,4.253807106598985

The music and lyrics grow out of the context of the relationship between the two main characters, as they introduce themselves slowly to each other. This film is both heart-breaking and affirming, and proves that love stories can have happy endings without everyone living happily ever after.",1409616000,,454,5.232876712328767

In my opinion, it is a minor miracle.  Subtle, sublime and heart-movingly wonderful.  How two people who come together seemingly at random grow quickly to love each other; but how each quietly 'knows' that s/he cannot (at least at that moment) be together....  I wonder what destiny and providence hold for these two simple but glorious folks.  May they both be happy.  And for the time or for the duration, bear their necessary heartaches well.  I've also grown to adore the music.  Which is greatly and, also, ever so sensitively raised to a new level in the stage version.  It took me a while to realize this too.

2997030,4,B000X1Z0BU,"A different kind of love story. Fresh. Real. The camerawork is raw, and sometimes a bit shaky unlike major studio productions. But, you get into the characters and the music and that kind of just goes away. Music was superb!. You begin to memorize the songs and sing along.

2997037,5,B000X1Z0BU,I've always been a fan of stories that follow a musician's dream of reaching an audience. This is also a love story of two friends who have only an outlet in musical expression. As they grow to admire one another and create truly haunting and exciting modern Irish folk music they run into a few obstacles which they overcome with grace and great generosity of spirit. FIlmed on two handy cams with a small independent budget this is a miraculously inventive and worthy piece of art you would be remiss to not see!,1403827200,,514,4.537634408602151
2997038,4,B000X1Z0BU,"Watching ""Once"" I was reminded of ""The Commitments"" (no surprise, Hansard played in it) - which I liked better because it was more complex in its plot, and of ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" which disappoints a bit when compared to ""Once"". The music in ""Once"" is great, the actors convincing and the plot bittersweet but certainly believable. A happy end would have been wrong! Enjoy the film - it will make you feel good!",1403395200,,412,4.657534246575342
2997039,4,B000X1Z0BU,"Spoiler alert: I saw the play and was really hoping for a different ending but the movie stayed true to the story. This is a play/film about a platonic relationship.

2997044,5,B000X1Z0BU,"This is one of my favorite musicals of all time. One because it has a story, and two, because instead of hiring actors to pretend like they play music, they used actual talented musicians...who did a decent job acting. If you have a pulse, you'll love this movie.",1403136000,,263,4.5
2997045,5,B000X1Z0BU,I could listen to this soundtrack forever and never tire of it.  I get really bored watching movies over and over but this one always makes me cry at the exact location even though I know the ending.  It is so not Hollywood and that is what makes it wonderful.  The music is cerebral and contains the 2008 Academy Award winning song Falling Slowly.  In the movie it was a climax on a piano/guitar with the eb and flow of the interaction.  Didn't need any nudity because it was better than physical lovemaking.,1403136000,2,509,4.43010752688172
2997046,5,B000X1Z0BU,"I just saw this film for the second time since its release 7 years ago. Its naturalistic approach to love and life, letting the music develop and sustain the plot line rather than the events or even the dialogue,
provides us with an extraordinary film experience. The first duet that the new friends play has haunted me for years but I was unable to understand the words.  This time I opened ""closed captions"" on my screen menu and the exquisite lyrics were there for me, not disrupting the bonding that rapidly develops between  the young people as they play.  Money is not readily available to me at this moment but I immediately ordered ""Once"" and hope to share it with a wide variety of family and friends.  This film remains a sleeper.  For me, it is a classic!",1403049600,,766,4.521739130434782

2997048,5,B000X1Z0BU,"A perfect love story with an unpredictable ending and magnificent music.  It is easy to see how the little indie picture managed to survive for several years, often buried in the dark, only to shoot forward to win the Oscar for best score.  I highly recommend it.  Watch it with a loved one.  Note:  The first minute and a half or so are in thick Gallic, and a little hard to understand.  Hang in there, it clears up right away..",1402876800,,429,4.3

2997054,5,B000X1Z0BU,"A steal for a great movie. They made this into a broadway musical, so that says something about the story telling. The music is great.

2997055,5,B000X1Z0BU,"A friend of mine stopped watching the movie because he had trouble with the accents. Well, you might not be able to pick up every word, but your heart will understand. This is such a beautiful movie about creativity, longing, and love. The scene in the music shop where she starts playing the piano is a mini-movie in itself. Overall, well-deserving of all the praise the other reviewers have heaped upon it.",1401926400,,408,4.680555555555555

2997057,2,B000X1Z0BU,I bought this because the characters are Irish (who doesn't love a good Irish love story?!).  But the movie was pretty boring and repetitive.  The main female actress was a bit bland and there wasn't much chemistry between her and the male lead.  Too much music and not enough substance.,1401926400,,287,4.7

2997062,5,B000X1Z0BU,"Small movie, made with two handheld cameras, in 17 days for 100,000 euros. You can believe the characters and their interaction.  a couple of scenes stayed in mind for a long time,  Though it was a satisfying movie in and of itself I wish there were a part two so I could see what happened next.  That's how much I cared about the characters.

2997065,4,B000X1Z0BU,"I think this came first, but the play was way better. I really got irritated that there was none of the comedy that's been added into the play. I suspect this was a low budget film. The story differs just enough to really irk me at points such as not giving the supporting cast a greater story. I still enjoyed it, but not nearly as much as I enjoyed the play. Perhaps if they decide to do a sequel that will be fixed. If you're trying to decide between seeing the movie or the play first, I would suggest watch the movie first. You'll have a greater understanding of some of the things during the play and you'll be pleasantly surprised with the script improvements.",1401148800,,667,4.344

But after seeing the movie, I reflected on how it's refreshing to have a movie where two people are kindred spirits, but it doesn't lead to a one night stand or a short-lived infatuation. They help to heal each others hearts, make a great record, then life moves on. It's a beautiful movie, with FANTASTIC music.",1399593600,,413,4.447368421052632

2997097,5,B000X1Z0BU,"I received the DVD in brand new condition, which was great.  There area a lot of really great special features, including interviews with the cast and crew, which make worth owning.
The film itself easily makes my top ten.  Normally I don't like musicals, but the numbers are done in a way that is fully integrated into the film.  Usually I'm left wondering why characters in Disney films are suddenly breaking into song.
Where this film really succeed is in its story, which is very basic love story, but done in such an eloquent way I can't help loving it.  I think they also manage to avoid a lot of the love story clichs.  This film is about two people who bond through their music.
My one criticism is although all the characters are speaking English, it's hard to understand some of the thick accents sometimes.  I had to turn on the subtitles the first time I watched it.  But that didn't hinder my enjoyment of the film at all.
So, I highly recommend this film.  It's about people being in love, and I think everyone can relate to that.",1397260800,,1044,4.457894736842105

2997112,5,B000X1Z0BU,The music is awesome. I keep hearing it my head long after I watched it. This is a touching story of how music inspires all of us. I was surprised to see the actors are also the song writers. They are equally talented in both.,1394323200,,226,4.044444444444444
2997113,5,B000X1Z0BU,"I bought this after seeing the play on Broadway in Feb 2014.  Not sure which I liked better.  My 18 year old daughter loved the play because it left you with the hope that the couple would be together in the end.  SPOILER ALERT** The movie has them parting ways, and in the spirit of romantic, boy-and-girl-are-together-in-the-end-movies, this doesn't do it.
 The soundtrack is infectious and I've had it in my car for over a month.  Just when I think I can't listen to it anymore, I put it on again and I can still feel the spirit of the actors in the play and movie.  That's powerful!",1394236800,,586,4.37962962962963

In addition to the vacuum repair he can provide, she and the Irish lad connect and create music at a recording studio, surprising themselves and everyone involved in the effort.

They were actual musicians and relative unknowns in the acting world, but they do such a good job in this charming small movie.  It depicts the pathway of a pair of artists in getting their music heard,  and the challenges of their growing affection for each other. I had seen it on PBS but a lot of the language was bleeped out, and it was really hard to watch with all the resulting glitches. Somehow it didn't bother me when I watched this dvd and the cursing was rendered in a heavy Irish accent.",1392076800,,574,4.40566037735849

It is a film that is very different from modern romantic films as it displays authentic keenness between a man and a woman without the attachment of intimate pleasures.

I went to see the play on Broadway and fell completely in love with the music and the story.  I came home and ordered this movie and it didn't disappoint.  It was shot on a super low budget but captured the spirit of the story so well.  The actors are darling, the music is GREAT and the story is wonderful.  Highly recommend it to anyone who loves music, loves anything Irish and who loves a good love story.  This is not your typical Chick Flick - it's good for everyone.  It's only rated R because the ""F bomb"" is dropped a million times but who cares when it's in an Irish brogue!",1390953600,,744,4.125

I can't wait.
I'm hoping no sequel arises from this since it is perfect in it's own right.

2997159,1,B000X1Z0BU,"The amount of praise surrounding this film baffles me. I almost feel bad giving this rating myself but the truth is, the film is just a poor attempt of a musician trying to break into the limelight. With the intention of being a charming, offbeat, tear jerking romance, it translates to a cheesy and boring waste of time. Poor acting eliminates all connection between the characters, poor writing makes the songs almost hard to listen to, and poor production makes it even hard to watch. Seriously, if you have no budget to work with, at least make your film's plot fresh or interesting. The story has been done many times and this is simply one of the worst of them. The movie came highly recommended from my ex girlfriend. After watching it through, I didn't have the heart to tell her how much I disliked it. Maybe every positive review out there is the result of that same guilt...
The only way I would recommend Once to anyone is if I desperately wanted them to stop asking me for movie recommendations...or if I hated them as much as I do the film.",1390089600,,1054,4.494791666666667

2997163,5,B000X1Z0BU,Well done and almost surreal. You don't have to be a romantic either. The music alone is worthy of attention.,1389657600,,109,4.5

Would recommend this movie to teens & adults. It's pretty cleancut and the music is so great, they've made a musical stageplay out of it, which I really enjoyed this fall.

2997174,5,B000X1Z0BU,"This is a great independent, musical film about hope. The sort of 'romance' is a secondary part of the film that adds to its likability.

I found the fact that neither of the main characters' name was revealed (they are billed in the credits as, ""Guy"" and ""Girl"") particularly irritating. That's 85 minute of my life I would like to have back.

I did like the song ""Falling Slowly"", but that's it.

2997190,5,B000X1Z0BU,Fantastic movie. Indie films don't really benefit from the visual and sound quality that Blu-Ray offers but this movie needs to be in your library if you enjoy a quality story with a great soundtrack.,1385942400,,200,4.742857142857143

Beyond that uneasiness, it is a beautiful account of two people re-discovering life after brokenness in their own lives through sharing a deep intimacy through music that reached far beyond the expected physical expression.",1385337600,2,439,5.013698630136986

It is truly very romantic with the reality of that our journey on earth will allow us to meet ones just to share love and magic with them for a while before we separate making that event a very influencing fact in our life.

I enjoyed the relationship of the guitar player and the girl who he met while playing music on the streets. .She was so very sweet and a talented piano player. He was very passionate about playing his songs he wrote and wanted to make a CD of his music. He became very fond of her. It was because they were enjoying making this CD. They both had past loves and
wrote songs of the relationships that seemed lost. I found that with each of them writing out their feelings in the words of the songs they realized that maybe they should try these past relationships again. They chose to go their separate ways instead of trying a new relationship together.",1382400000,,679,4.44

Not all stories end with a ""happily ever after.""  But the ending is honest. And the movie comes across like a documentary, as if someone just happened to film this happening. It's charming and entertaining and compelling.  So much so that they made an incredibly-successful Broadway show out of it.  See the original - it's SO worth it.",1381190400,,479,4.72289156626506

He's a busker and vacuum repairman, while she sells magazines and cleans houses.  He's an Irishman with a lost love who left for England.  She has a husband in the Czech Republic. But the two of them have their own personal musical passions, and when those are combined, the result is more beautiful yet.  Like watching two desperate ships passing in the night, the viewer hopes these two will find safe harbor together.

2997252,5,B000X1Z0BU,"I cannot say enough about this simple, poignent film. There are not a lot of Hollywood flair to this film and that's what makes it so good. The ""actors"" are the real musicians and they deliver a real, emotional performance. I saw the Broadway play after the film and I enjoyed it - the film still holds first place for me but it was nice to see it come to life on stage. If you love good music you will love this film.",1370390400,,418,4.048192771084337

They make great music together. Boy still misses London girlfriend. I enjoyed the music so much I bought the sound track. Only when I shared a viewing with a friend did I note the abundance of the F bomb. Beyond that disappointment, I, very much, enjoyed the story. Although the lead characters were musicians first and actors second, I saw no deficiency. The lead actor/musician wrote many of the compositions. Happy times mixed with tears. In spite of my faulting it for the language, I DID enjoy this movie - to the point of purchasing it. To help with your overall experience, be sure to watch the bonus features. Maybe, like me, you'll also buy the music. Grab a glass of wine, some cheese and crackers and sit down and watch this one.",1370217600,3,907,4.604938271604938

2997258,5,B000X1Z0BU,"This movie was very entertaining as a slow paced mayhappenstance love story with an alternative ending you don't see in more movies. It is a melancholy presentation leading your heart to want them to succeed...

The movie has music integrated into it but is far from any musical I have ever seen. It may be a bit slow for some people who have short attention spans and lack the ability to stay with the plot line. If you are uncultured in the way of foreign mild Irish accents you may have a hard time understanding the dialogue in parts. It is a cute Sunday movie I would suggest you watch with your romantic partner.",1367798400,,618,4.421052631578948

2997262,5,B000X1Z0BU,"I was so surprised and pleased to see that this finally came out on Blu-ray! I have to confess, though, that I was skeptical about whether or not it would actually turn out to be ""Region-Free"" (see my review of the theoretically all-region BD of ""Clone"")... especially since the ""Product Details"" section of Amazon's ad states that it is ""Region B/2"".

For myself, it wouldn't matter, since (thanks to the ""Clone"" fiasco) I now have an all-region-modified Oppo BDP-103 player (best BD player on the planet, by the way)... but for the sake of others who need this disc to truly be an all-region one, I'm happy to announce that it is. Incidentally... sharp-eyed consumers will notice that rather than displaying the ""A-B-C"" region-code symbol on the back of the case, there is no region-code symbol at all. Just to make sure... I switched my Oppo to each of the three individual Blu-ray regions, and this disc played perfectly on each one.

The only caveat I have about the disc is that on the back of the disc's case, it states that the feature's audio output is Dolby Digital 5.1 / DTS Surround / DTS-HD Master Audio... which was an unexpected but very pleasant surprise.

Not true.

The original Standard-Def DVD release of this film was done in 2.1 Dolby Surround... and, not surprisingly, so is this Blu-ray.

Nonetheless... this remains as one of my all-time favorite films, and to have it in beautiful high-definition is absolutely wonderful.

HIGHLY recommended.",1366934400,,1468,4.852

I love it all.  I even bought the soundtrack to the movie and loved  it on Broadway too (it won the best musical Tony).

I checked the DVD out of the local library only to find a damaged spot that completely disrupted the continuity of the story. I was glad to see it uninterrupted.

The director attests they were going for simplicity in the movie and it shows throughout. Other than Hansard's constant moping about his ex, the only real emotion displayed in this film is in the songs. But they are too born in angst and sadness to be inspiring. I wish we could have seen more character development with these two. I never got the impression Marketa was in love enough with her absent husband to welcome him back.

The acting is wonderful, genuine - you forget that it's not a documentary. It doesn't have the Hollywood ending, which I also like. Has moments of real humor, drama (not melodrama, thank goodness) - sincerity. Wonderful film - if I had anything negative to say, and I really don't, it went on a bit long.

I felt incredibly bored through the entire movie. I also found the songs completely unappealing, and in fact irritating to sit through. There were parts where I couldn't make out the dialogue due to the accents, so that didn't help.  I forced myself to finish watching to see if it got better in the end, since so many people seem to like this movie. It didn't get any better.

This ONCE is a gem that demands so little of us audience because it does not seek for the bright light. Rather it tells a simple story of two people (whose names we never learn in the movie) who just are. The story does not preach, nor does it solicit our sympathy or any such emotion. Yet one cannot help but find a place in the heart that rings true with what ONCE gently presents.

However, it still portrays, passion for life, struggle, awkward human emotions, survival, and accomplishment. Last, the end doesn't leave life in a pretty bow tied package. There are still struggles going on through the successes. This felt refreshing.

It also feels so honest from a musical perspective because they aren't ""real"" actors. They are ""real"" musicians. It makes the movie more authentic. (I always hate watching an actor pretend to play an instrument with bad technique. It becomes so distracting that I can't even hear the music.) The music written for the movie is nice too!

There's something about ""knowing"" that other ""YOUNG"" people on this planet BELIEVE that a man and woman can connect on a level that transcends SEX SCENES and BREAK UP SCENES and truly unite on the most human of levels...in perfect harmony. It just KNOCKED ME OUT! I sobbed with gratitude during the final credits.

It blew them away with the singing, acting, stage, choreography, script... They couldn't imagine that the movie could live up to that live experience.  While of course not the same, they both loved the movie which rekindled so many warm (and funny) moments.  Is this a blockbuster, mega-million movie? No way and it would lose so much if it were.  Its the flower in a forest that you came upon and simply enjoyed its splendor.  I only saw the movie and was brought into the emotion.  Worth watching quietly.",1349913600,,658,4.620689655172414
2997339,5,B000X1Z0BU,"I learned of this film after hearing about the Broadway show of the same name, which garnered a lot of attention at this year's Tony awards. Reading the various reviews posted here on Amazon is like reliving the iPhone-vs.-Android battle: people seem to be fiercely loyal to the music from either this film or the Broadway cast.  Personally, I think they're both great. The film is romantic and simple. Two people are falling in love, and the music not only seasons the story; it advances it. The songs are deceptively simple but work under your skin, and the entire soundtrack is beautiful and heartfelt. The story is one we've perhaps heard before, but told well. The two stars of the film also wrote and perform the music. The male lead was involved with and gave his blessing to the Broadway show...if he is happy with it, that's good enough for me. I'll likely never get the opportunity to see this show on Broadway, but I'm thrilled to have seen the film, which I'll doubtless watch again and again.

By the way, what a cool feature with Amazon...when I purchased this DVD I got a free 'ticket' to watch the film immediately on Amazon Prime streaming!

Yet it's so absorbing and the characters and situations seem so real. (I am not, by the way, an arty indie snob..I love movies, including big budget blockbuster movies.) It touched me as no other movie has in years. And the music! I also fell in love with the music, which now has a prominent place on my Ipod.

2997362,5,B000X1Z0BU,"This was my favorite film from 2007.  I just purchased this Blu ray version.  It is a European product that I will discuss later in the review.  While ""Once"" is not a traditional musical, about 60% of the film is made up of music.  What makes this movie so special is the way the music is developed.  The Guy and the Girl (that's how the characters are identified) meet in Dublin, Ireland.  The Guy is a native and the Girl is from the Czech Republic.  They are both struggling musicians and begin a friendship that produces some of the best original music from a movie in years (won an Oscar for best song).

Naturally they are attracted to each other but both carry relationship baggage of the recent past.  Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova are rookie actors in the lead roles but are real musicians that became real lovers off-screen.  The Guy and the Girl are obviously meant for each other yet remain committed to others so their relationship doesn't go much beyond great friendship.  But the final scene where the Girl is looking forlornly out her window lets you know she may have just lost more than a musical partner.

When I first saw this film, I was mesmerized by the development of the music.  It was so real it felt almost like a documentary.  Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova are perfect in their roles and show a different side of acting.  Both are terrific musicians and the music is some of the best I've heard in a film.  The songs are poignant and just gorgeous.  Three great scenes to watch for:  1. When the Guy and the Girl finish the standout ""Falling Slowly"" that the Guy had begun to write.  This is done in a music store.  2.  When the Girl, listening on headphones, sings the words she had written to the Guy's song while walking home from the store where she had purchased batteries for the CD player.  Done in one take!  3.  When the Girl struggles through a very sad song she had written and finally breaks down before she can finish.  Just great direction and great emotion from the actors.  There are many other great scenes in this simple but effective and heartbreakingly beautiful story completed on a miniscule budget.

I had purchased this upgrade to a DVD I owned based on improved video quality as well as an uncompressed audio track.  The Blu ray video is excellent and is definitely better than the original DVD.  The audio is not what was advertised by the seller's (not Amazon) website or even on the Blu ray jacket.  Here is the wording on the jacket label: ""Feature audio:  Dolby Digital 5.1/DTS Surround DTS-HD Master Audio.""  Here's what you get:  DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0.  There are 2 additional commentary channels both in DTS-HD MA 2.0.  While I admit I was disappointed and clearly this is a labeling error, I have to assume the filmmakers wanted it this way.  The sound is clear and strong, but is not the surround generally expected.  I suspect the idea was to keep the sound in its basic format as it was made at the time.",1341964800,,2977,4.51782363977486

I found this to be so offensive that it totally negated any positive effects of the music. As for the music, several of the songs are more shouted than sung, and the music is dissonant and harsh rather than melodic, sweet and lyrical.

Now five years later, I watched it again and got even more out of it. So much so, that I immediately purchased the soundtrack recording. (Not sure why I didn't the first time.)

Besides the great music by Glen Hansard and Markta Irglov, the evolving platonic love story between the two of them is incredibly refreshing in this day of meaningless sex. Here we have meaningful love, but in the end they both return to their former loves, even while knowing that something special has developed between the two of them.

What I didn't catch the first time is how the music in many places propels the plot forward. Even a line in the show given in Czech and never translated, gives a hint as to what's really going on.

This film is delightful, and the fact that the film is low budget adds to the innocent quality of whole thing: music, story and location. I mean, what's not to love about Dublin?",1333497600,,1009,4.443243243243243

2997374,5,B000X1Z0BU,"Once (2006)
Drama, Music, Romance, 85 minutes
Directed by John Carney
Starring Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova

The opening scene in Once shows a guy (Hansard) busking. The song is unremarkable, but a few people like it and give him their change. Then, two minutes later, something incredible happens. We see the guy singing at night when the streets are virtually deserted. Although he's alone, he's pouring his heart out using his beaten up guitar and raspy voice.

I was hooked from that moment on.

When the guy looks up, there's a girl (Irglova) standing there listening. We never learn their names. It's as if the story is more important than the people in it. She gives him 10 cents and they begin talking. He works with his father in a vacuum cleaner repair shop and she has a vacuum cleaner in need of repair. When she brings it the following day, she treats it like a dog on a leash.

The two have lunch together and she takes him to a music shop where the owner allows her to play piano. When she plays a piece by Mendelssohn, the guy's jaw drops open in astonishment. She invites him to join her on his guitar and he teaches her how to play one of his songs. That's how they begin their friendship.

The setting is Dublin and life isn't easy. The guy and the girl don't have much money. But what does shine through is the Irish sense of community. They love life and the people seem genuine and real. That description also applies to Once.

The film was shot on a budget of around 100,000 using two Handycam camcorders, but you'll quickly forget that and focus on the story.

The guy has broken up with his girlfriend and she has moved to London. The girl married at a young age, but her husband is back in the Czech Republic and has left her. So there's the possibility of romance and I won't ruin what happens for anyone who hasn't seen the film. What's even more important is their shared love of music. The two have a real connection and she wants to help him reach a wider audience by negotiating the use of a local music studio for the weekend.

There are two wonderful reactions later in the film. One comes from Eamon, who is an audio technician at the studio; the other comes from the guy's dad when the guy plays him a CD.

The special features mention that over half the film is told through the use of song, but this is not a musical. The songs never make you step outside the story and they come across as totally natural. As well as music, there's plenty of dry humor, but the story is mainly about relationships and pursuing your dreams.

Once is one of the most heartwarming stories that I have ever seen. The song Falling Slowly won the Oscar for best song and Hansard and Irglova have toured under the name The Swell Season. It just goes to show that you don't need to spend millions in order to make a film that touches people, and this touched me more than most.

In a world which rewards artists with the right look and a manufactured sound, it's refreshing to see people with real passion succeed.

The picture quality is fantastic and the best reason to upgrade to the Blu-Ray from the DVD, or to buy the Blu-Ray over the DVD. As for the audio quality, I was a little disappointed that the Blu-Ray did not feature an upgraded audio mix from the stereo mix on the DVD; this is quite likely that the original theatrical release was only a stereo mix, but it would have been nice for a little upgrade in audio quality.

Some previous reviews noted that the additional content did not play for them on this UK release - I had no problems playing the bonus material. It is likely that the bonus material is in the PAL format used in Europe as opposed to NTSC used in the states, and if so then it is probably and issue with not all Blu-Ray players and/or HDTVs being compatible with that format.

2997405,5,B000X1Z0BU,"I recently saw this movie and it goes up there with one of my all time favorites.  It takes a unique twist on the ""boy meets girl"" dynamic.  If you want to make it comparable to another script it is part Music and Lyrics and part Before Sunrise, but truly this movie stands on it's own.

What makes this movie outstanding outside of the phenomenal soundtrack (which are all ORIGINAL songs for this movie ...when was the LAST time you can say that about a contemporary movie??) is the beautiful portrayal of the touching relationship between the man and woman.  For a moment it borders on the clich romance but their relationship connects more on the creative level.  Watching these two develop music together is nothing short of magical.  It gave me chills to see how each other's talents just blossomed when they were working together.  The music is unbelievably good.  The lyrics are heartbreaking and the piano and guitar and the harmonizing voices are fantastic.  I was reminded of Joan Biaz, Bob Dylan and Simon and Garfunkel while listening ...again though the comparisons aren't quite right ...it's that different.

What I also love is the subtle realism of this movie.  It doesn't have the flashy lights or the BIG dramatics or the drop dead gorgeous actors who hair and make up is so perfect that they look good from any angle.  It was shot creatively but felt almost like a documentary.  It allows you to connect with the situations deeper than any movie.  For example, when the girl was walking the streets up late b/c she just had to finish getting her thoughts down for a song, I was instantly transported back to so many nights when I did that writing down thoughts for papers at college or when I had to figure out my thoughts for a personal conflict and was compelled to walk until I finished.  Everything about the situation felt genuine, from the way she emptied out every remote in the house to how she ran out to the corner store in those ridiculous slippers.  I understood her character on a level I normally don't when watching a movie.

I would be remiss not to mention the music again.  I had never heard of either of these artists before watching this movie.  However I didn't feel like it was an unabashed attempt at self promotion.  The story was just as exceptional as the music.
If you are looking for a good STORY, wonderful ACTING and excellent MUSIC this is the flick for you.  However, if you are into cheap thrills, flashy car chases, and huge overblown drama ...it probably won't do a thing for you.",1314662400,2,2534,4.599109131403118
2997406,4,B000X1Z0BU,"I absolutely loved this movie.  Right after it finished I ran into my basement and started working on my own songs with my guitar.  I just wish I could write songs like this guy and girl!  I checked out the credits because i didn't even know that the movie's stars are the actual songwriters and obviously performers.  I also noticed acting credits said ""the guy"" and ""the girl""- I didn't even realize that they had no names until the end credits.

The existing reviews give good movie summaries, so i'll just point out a few of my favorite scenes.  Well, to start with I'm obsessive about watching the beginning of a movie- if I miss the beginning I don't want to see it.  Because the beginning is usually the best part- well I loved how art and commerce collide at the beginning when the street singer is robbed of his few dollars while he's singing, by another street person and then chases the robber through the streets- funny stuff.  Then I loved how after the ""girl and guy"" meet, she brings her vacuum cleaner so he can fix it and she rolls it down the street like she's was walking a dog!  Hilarious.  Then the couple visit a music store and she gets on the piano and he teaches her a new song of his and I was just overcome by this scene.  I think that girls cry when they're young and that guys start crying when they get older- because I just started tearing up!  I don't even know these people but I was overwhelmed by the beauty of the music.  I thought at that moment-- that is what music is- its love, its sex, its beautiful.  Music is magic and this scene was magic.

It is the story of a simple friendship between a broken-hearted vacuum cleaner repairman / street musician and a young immigrant single mother who loves to play  piano and sings beautifully.  The actors wrote all the music for the film and this was the female leads first venture into acting.  The fact that it is set in Dublin Ireland first drew me to the film.

2997410,5,B000X1Z0BU,"Some day people will hear the anthemic ballad ""Falling Slowly"" and have absolutely no idea that it formed the emotional core of the most beloved film of the 2000s.

It's just that good a song...it really is.

Of course, there will also be future-cinephiles that discover John Carney's lovely music-film ONCE and find themselves awed by the discovery of so gorgeous a paean to romantic love tucked away in such an unassuming little Irish indie.

Indeed, ONCE is a film that most of us fell very quickly for, actually.

ONCE succeeds largely on the shoulders of its powerhouse songs...co-written and performed by its two stars, Glen Hansard and Markta Irglov. There is a story of course...two lonely souls fall in love while making beautiful music together...but make no mistake, ONCE is more concerned with connecting its relational dots with sweet melody, not pitch-perfect plotting.

In addition to the aforementioned ""Falling Slowly,"" other standout songs/scenes include the heart-pounding opening number ""Say It to Me Now,"" the soaring ""When Your Mind's Made Up,"" and the most heartbreaking break-up ballad ever, ""Lies.""

But if you have been walking out of the big-budget, mainstream movie offerings at the local 36 screen Mondoplex feeling vaguely dissatisfied, thinking to yourself, ""there must be something more,"" then ""Once"" is a great place to start finding that something more.

Pablo Picasso said, ""Art is the lie that makes us understand the truth.""  Believe it or not, there is a whole universe of artistic truth that is outside the walls of the shallow, predictable realm created by market studies and focus groups.  If you are ready to put your foot into deeper waters, you can't go wrong with ""Once.""

2997414,3,B000X1Z0BU,"With nearly 300 very enthusiastic reviews already on Amazon, normally I wouldn't bother adding just one more, but in this case I am.

I received the soundtrack for the movie and played it over and over again.  I listened to the melodies, the lyrics, and absolutely enjoyed it every time it was played. An easy five star rating for the music.  So, I then almost anxiously got a copy of the DVD and was ready to be carried away by a modern day ""musical"".

As the movie unfolded ....
it was obvious that the movie was a vehicle for the music and not the other way around.  Normally, this would be fine if a) the script was good, b) the acting was fair, or c) if the production was such that it created the charm of the music.  If you watch the Extra Features, the director proudly says that he started with a sixty page script and he didn't want to overcomplicate the project with the pressure of overinvestment.  I can certainly appreciate why someone might feel that way, but the overall story just missed.  First, the songs don't tell the story of the characters very well and in some cases they down right contradict what's presented in the movie.  This is what happens when a script is thrown together using some extremely talented musicians without any acting experience.  I certainly don't fault the main characters, but they simply didn't pull off their parts with many lines being choppy and unconvincing.  There was no real flow or continuity just pronouncements about what was coming next and the reaction of the actors to those pronouncements.  So, all in all, the soundtrack set a bar for the movie that was so high that it was not going to work unless they really attempted to mold the movie more closely to the lyrics of the songs.

I can see why this won awards at Sundance ...
if you never heard the music and just sat back and treated it like a very rough indy movie, you'd be carried away by the music missing that the acting was both forgivable and forgetable.  But unfortunately, the movie, the direction, the many occurences when a scene didn't work and when they should have reshot (assuming the director knew to reshoot ... maybe he didn't) just made the movie clumsy and awkward ... something like the main characters.  Perhaps there's some beauty in that, but it is clearly a case of lost potential with such a beautiful soundtrack primarily written by Glen Hansard.

In case you're interested in the story ...
it's a boy meets girl in Dublin, he plays music, she plays music, they play music together.  Reality and history ulitmately set in and the rest you can find out by watching the movie (or reading another review that has a spoiler in it).

So I highly recommend ...
buying the CD ... listening to it a million times ... borrow the video and watch it Once (no pun intended) ... and if you really think that it rivals Brief Encounters or has the charm of similar movies (non-musical) like Before Sunrise, maybe even purchase it.",1296518400,,2958,4.549056603773585

It was wonderful. So unlike most American movies, it was unique, unpredictable and heartwarming.

The two leads are well played, raw, honest and never seemed like 'acted' roles.
There is quite a bit of adult language though so it is not for the younger crowd. The actor's heavy accents can also get in the way of comprehension but for the most part are understandable.

Besides the music being great, the relationship between ""guy"" and ""girl"" (you never know their names) is terrific. They both hold their own ground and play on each other well. They are a great compliment to each other. ""Guy"" is rough, angry and struggling. ""Girl"" is softer, motherly, and friendly.

One of my favorite scenes is ""girl"" walking around town pulling her vacuum along like a pet, in the hopes that ""guy"" can fix it.

2997452,4,B000X1Z0BU,"When Two Worlds Collide-Updated October 2013

Everybody, everybody who lives in cities, or who takes public transportation to the city has seen some straggly, snarling, struggling guy playing guitar, playing it well or poorly but playing it to rise above the din of city noises, and singing. Singing covers of some popular tunes, some tunes which will get we damn busy heads down travelers already late for something to listen up for a minute. Singing and strumming, well or poorly, but always with an open guitar case in for the ""thank you kindly"" donation that allows him to survive, to breathe, to write his lonely ballads, and to keep the wolves (read: landlord and other bill collectors) from his door. What you probably didn't know, unless of course you are among the seven people in the world who still listens to and supports folk music, roots music, street music or whatever you want to call it,  that those nameless guys (and gals) have stories to tell. Have the usual array of problems and dreams like the rest of us.

Problems like love, marriage, kids, lost ones, and dreams of making it off the streets and into the music studios and then... That back story, both the problems and the dream parts, are what drives this film under review, Once, about the connection, for a moment in time as it turned out, between a guy street musician in Dublin (that`s in Ireland for the heathens and an immigrant girl wannabe musician (immigrant in the days when, for a minute, Ireland stopped being a place to get bloody well out of going across the sea to Liverpool or across the pond to Amerikee and was a place to go to for dreams).

Under normal circumstance such a boy meets girl saga, would seemingly pose no problems for them getting together. There would almost have to be (and was) a natural attraction. But that is where the back story gets complicated, complicated just like for the rest of us. First off the guy was still pining away for his muse-girlfriend (Irish) who betrayed him with another lover and who was off in London. Secondly the girl, a Czech national, was married, married with a child, a little girl, (and with a mother in tow) whose estranged husband is back in the Czech Republic. What draws them together is the love of music. His rough-hewn plainsongs of sorrow and lost and her more delicate wistful attempts to make sense of a world through song (and piano) that is kind of passing her by.

But to the music, the all- consuming music that is really the star of this film since a great deal of its time is spent with the pair alternately flirting and creating something like a demo CD to shop around in order to get their big break, the one that will right their lives. That music, which by the way was written and sung by the actors who played the boy and girl (Glen Hansard and  Marketa Irglova), gets a lot of work-out here as he or she will burst into song at command. But in the end the two worlds, the world of the muse-driven (and career-driven as well) Irishman and a young immigrant woman looking for a father for her daughter as well as the music just couldn't mix, couldn't stand the huge effort to put those two worlds together. Couldn't stand the collision. As so they went their separate ways.  How is that for a back story of that straggly, snarling, struggling guy you see at that subway stop every workday morning.

Original Review

This is a quirky film. No question. It provides a very interesting twist in today's international multi-cultural society on the standard boy meets girl theme, and in Dublin no less. It also provides a quirky look at a subject that has always interested me, the trials and tribulations of trying to make ends meet while one is waiting to get one's big chance on the musical scene.

As for the boy (Glen Hansard) meets girl (Marketa Irglova)part the two, a strong but sensitive Irish lad trying to go from busker (street singer) to the limelight and a displaced Czech gal (with child and mother in tow) trying to make it on her own in up and coming modern day ""Irish Tiger"" (at least up until the last couple of years) Dublin. The glue that puts them together?  Well, she just happens to be something of a muse- and apparently classically- trained at that. This one and one half hour film centers on that musical collaboration, the possible budding romance between the two, the baggage and drag of their previous lives and something of a surprise at the end. All the while they are making beautiful music together, really just the music folks (for the most part, although some of his singing is a little over the edge for my tastes). What no over-the top, no gratuitous violence to save a fair damsel in distress, no ironic detachment under the stress of modern living?  No. I told you this was a quirky movie.",1258243200,,4790,4.56993006993007

2997454,5,B000X1Z0BU,"This movie comes as close as any I have seen to what it is like to make music with other musicians. The scene in the music store is a perfect example of those rare moments when two people sit down to play for the first time and ""magic"" happens. The scene toward the end of the film when the musicians leave the recording studio in the early morning hours captures the essence of recording music perfectly. Unlike some of the other reviewers I liked the fact that they relationship between the Guy and the Girl did not follow the typical Hollywood arc. Another refreshing departure from the standard movie musical was the relationship between the Guy and his father. The music is a matter of taste. I happened to like it and understand that street musicians cannot deal in subtleties; they have to grab the audience by the throat. This movie's other achievement it to reimagining the musical in a more realistic way, and on that level it is a triumph. The music is more organic and not artificially injected into the story. The fact that it was done on an incredibly low budget shows that the concept and story matter more than anything else in making a great film.

I can't believe they ended up having a real-life relationship because there are NO sparks between them whatsoever. The most realistic part of the film is when they meet at the beginning and he seems irritated and put-off by her. That's how I felt throughout the entire thing. I did like some of the songs, but apparently not the same ones as everyone else because the songs they repeated a few times were not my favorites. I can't believe this won any awards of any kind.

2997474,5,B000X1Z0BU,"It's been a while now since I saw ONCE, but there's been no lessening of impact. I marvel at it still and love it still. I've done the MP3 thing with the songs and have pimped the movie to my friends. Looking at the glowing reviews here, I don't really have much (or, really, anything) to contribute, other than my unreserved support for this fantastic movie. My apologies then for whatever redundancy may follow. Probably you've heard most or all of it before. Still, I'll hang a SPOILERS flag here.

Getting somewhat poetic now: Modest in ambition, woeful in budgeting, but lavish in the ways that count, in honesty and heart and sheer musicality, ONCE quite easily measures up to any glossy product put out by Hollywood. ONCE looks unglamorous and at times even amateurish, and seems more real becuase of it. Featuring the blue-collar city of Dublin as seen thru the eyes of its inhabitants, ONCE tells of a tiny increment of time spent together by an Irish busker who repairs vacuum cleaners as his grown-up job and an impoverished young Czech woman who can make a piano sing. Glen Hansard and Markta Irglov in these roles are so natural and pitch perfect that I was startled when I found out how little professional acting they've previously done. I wasn't startled at all, of course, to learn that these two are real life musicians, and very gifted.

Some background stuff, garnered mostly from a Glen Hansard interview I read in the Montreal Gazette (published 4.14.07): Director John Carney used to be the bassist for Hansard's real life band The Frames, before Carney moved on to cinema and directing. Originally Carney had only wanted to consult Hansard over Hansard's busking experiences and also to use his songs for ONCE. Actor Cillian Murphy had already signed on to play the lead role, but then he balked at singing the difficult shifts in Hansard's songs and also with working with Markta Irglov, who had never acted before. Murphy pulled out, and a gutted Carney was out one leading man. Days later, Hansard asked Carney to play bass at a gig he was performing with Markta Irglov (they'd just collaborated on an album), and it was during this time, when Carney was rocking out and seeing how well Glen and Markta were getting on, that Carney hit on the idea of having Hansard play the lead. Hansard, initially very reluctant, was eventually talked into it. The rest, as they say...

Just to underscore how shoestring ONCE's budget was, John Carney had to engage in guerilla filmmaking, declining to pay the permits for street filming. The opening scene was shot with hidden long lenses, so the people on the street had no clue that a film was being made. One fallout to this was that when the scene called for the guy to run off with Hansard's character's guitar case, one unwitting bystander, trying to help out, booted the ""thief"" in the nuggets. Heh. In a way, not having bigger budgeting helped to make this a better film. Much of the dialogue is improvised, and there's an intimacy and an organic feel to the story that probably would never have been tapped into if the film had been better financed or cast with a name actor.

But amateur shamateur. Glen Hansard and Markta Irglov develop amazing chemistry onscreen. It helps that they know each other in real and that the characters they play harbor real-life connotations, musicians playing musicians. In the credits, these characters are known only as ""the guy"" and ""the girl,"" but Hansard and Irglov breathe life into them and deftly convey the melancholy and the relentless tediousness of their lives. The film premise is this, simply: two sad people finding a connection, creating brilliant music and then parting ways. There's a romance, but it's unrequited and mostly unremarked upon. The girl is married, with a little girl. The guy, suffering from a broken heart, halfway hopes of someday doing big things with his music, but is stuck in a rut. The girl proves to be the motivating push. I think it would've played false if the ending had been different. As it is, what goes on between the two is understated and bittersweet and terribly romantic. There's something so wistful and sad about the girl's last lingering look out the window in that closing scene, as the camera then pans out to the street and the end credits roll.

The musical performances are what elevate this film into something truly special. There are tiny, significant moments etched out in this slice of life story, little vignettes full of glancing looks and endearingly awkward conversation and a sense that honest to gosh lives are actually being lived here. But there are at least four absolutely showstopping moments in ONCE, and these happen when Glen Hansard and Markta Irglov play their instruments and lift their voices to sing. The guy's savage evening rendition of ""Say It To Me Now"" out in the street. The riveting duet of ""Falling Slowly"" (my favorite) in the music shop. The girl's late night excursion to the convenience store and her stroll back home as she sings the lyrics she'd just composed to the guy's music (""If You Want Me""). The guy's makeshift band recording ""When Your Mind's Made Up"" in the studio and the sound engineer getting schooled by the band's performance. All amazing, flawless stuff.

DVD bonus features come in the way of what I think is a must-hear film commentary by Glen Hansard, Markta Irglov and Director John Carney; a separate commentary by the same three on six of the songs; ""making a modern day musical"" - the Making Of featurette (12.5 minutes long); ""more guy, more girl"" - a segment exploring the relationship between the two central characters (9.5 minutes long); a webisode ""broken hearted hoover fixer sucker guy"" (basically, this is just some rough sketches set to this song); and the option to download ""Falling Slowly"" from the motion picture soundtrack.

The key, of course, is that we so personally identify with these working class characters, who everyday struggle and doubt like we do and whose personal triumphs, like ours, are more often than not measured in modest achievements. This movie reaffirms that in the routine and greyness of our days are sometimes concealed shades of color. And that, if nothing else, there is always music. I love this movie.

But I wonder how ""the guy"" had got on in London?",1234828800,,6324,4.806066176470588

This movie is not, nor does it try to be, anything more than a slice of life set to music. The real magic of the movie comes from its simple, honest treatment of the everyday life of two musicians in Dublin and their meeting. Their relationship is both realistic and playful, and the fact that it never stoops to the cheesy or melodramatic keeps the movie down to earth where it belongs. We don't even ever learn the characters' names.

Those who do not like the music of this movie (mainly indie acoustic singer-songwriter-style) will not like this movie either. However, anyone who can appreciate beautiful and symbolic music should watch it just for the tunes. Both the lyrics and melody are simple and haunting, just like everything else in this movie.

2997487,4,B000X1Z0BU,"Once tells the story of an Irish guy (played by Glen Hansard) who's nursing a broken heart. He's a musician, and all his songs seem to be about a particular ex-girlfriend. He plays his guitar and sings in the street for change, also working in his father's vacuum cleaner repair shop to make money.

One day, our guy meets a girl (played by Marketa Irglova). The girl, a Czech immigrant, has a young daughter, and she works like crazy (flower seller, paper seller, etc.) to keep a roof over their heads and food on the table. Turns out, she's also a musician. She plays the piano and writes songs.

The two feel an immediate affinity for one another, and pretty soon, they are playing songs together. The girl has immense confidence in our guy, and she helps him get a small business loan so that he can record a professional demo in a Dublin studio. They get a small band together, haggle with a sound guy over studio space, and spend a wonderful weekend cutting the demo, which everyone pretty much agrees is brilliant.

Over the course of the film, we realize that the two are falling for each other, but the ending is not trite and syrupy. It's real.

What I loved about this movie - The film was shot in a little over two weeks and with a tiny budget. It feels like you are listening in on other people's lives. There is no posturing here, no ""acting."" Just understated conversations and amazing music. In a movie about musicians, it makes sense that most of the screen time is either spent playing music or talking about music. And the music, largely written and performed by Hansard and Irglova, is wonderful.

This is a not-to-be-missed film. One of the primary songs in the film, ""Falling Slowly,"" won the Oscar for original music last year. It's gorgeous and deserved the win.",1228694400,,1786,4.5514018691588785

2997489,4,B000X1Z0BU,"In our cynical age, it somehow seems especially creative, even courageous, to make a film that is not about corruption, ennui, ulterior motives, dysfunctional social structures, or tragic flaws.  Once is a film that is refreshing in its earnestness and in its respect for the things that add meaning and beauty to our lives.

I'm not a musician, but I once aspired to be one.  And if I have one pet peeve about film generally, it's how film often disrespects music.  It's often treated as a subordinate art, mixed in to add a little punch to the main event, the dramatic narrative.  So many films use music carelessly.

Not this film.  This is a film whose central focus is the way that music forges bonds between people; how music enables us to express our feelings, and not only to better understand but to care about others; and how music is sometimes the most beautiful thing available to grab hold of.

This film reminded me of a conversation I once had with a friend, in which we concluded that for almost every person's romantic moments, music is somehow involved. Maybe it's a song you've danced to together, or heard together during a special sharing moment.  Maybe it's simply music that you listened to privately to work through intense feelings.  All in all, I'd wager that few of us have ever fallen in love without music being a big part of the picture.

This film is essentially a musical - but it's not like any other musical I've seen.  It's not a film that asks you to shift back and forth between plausible dramatic action and wholly implausible musical production numbers.  Instead, in this film, the music is central to the action; the characters are making music together, and every piece of music performed in the film is in a context where you fully believe those characters might make music together in that way.  I can't think of another film where the music seemed to matter so much to the characters.

We are so conditioned in our culture to indulge our societal ADD at the expense of respecting music and its uplifting power.  Thus, when I first watched this film, I was initially feeling like, ""OK, enough of this song, time to cut to something else,"" - as if sitting through an entire piece of music was more than a film could ask of me.  But unless a film does this, it can never fully convey the sense of the joy of making music, and how it brings you closer to other people.  The film shows people experiencing this in all its fullness, a special, deeply human experience worth celebrating.

In a lesser film, the film's studio scene would involve some kind of subplot during the performance - furtive glances, repressed conflicts, other dramatic elements - it's all too easy to imagine.  Here the only focus of the scene is the shared satisfaction of making the music itself.  Similarly, a dinner party depicted in the film is significant chiefly for the music that people share during it.

The film is shot in a very natural, unobtrusive style; you often feel as though you are just a fly on the wall, whether it's in a repair shop or an apartment.

OK, a small confession: the music in this film isn't really my cup of tea.  It's more repetitive than I would like, especially so in the lyrics.  And I have an issue with music that is too persistently emotive.  I can deal with a song building to a pitch of emotionalism, but the songs in this film tried to sustain that high pitch more than is my personal taste.  But I say this not to criticize the film; it's simply to say that you can enjoy and respect this film even if this isn't your favorite musical genre. And, I must say, there is no denying that the protagonists do produce some harmonies that are genuinely, hauntingly lovely.  Favorite genre or no, there is some truly beautiful music here.

Another thing I appreciated about this film is that it felt no need to create contrived situations, black hats, or exaggerated conflicts.  The characters are real people, dealing with plausible issues - heartbreak, loneliness, parental responsibility, regret, money problems, frustrated hopes - which the film doesn't overplay.  It just shows men and women using music to work out the feelings that arise in their lives.  And, it should be said, the music enables the viewer to feel some of the emotion, too.  I saw some moist eyes at film's end.

I'm uncertain how much to recommend this film to my friends; it's certainly not Citizen Kane.  I am afraid that one of them would put it in the DVD player, decide the music was too plaintive, and start rolling their eyes.  For me, though, it all pulsed with sincerity, and I appreciated that feeling.

Music is one of the most precious enrichments of the human experience. This film respects that, and honors it.",1226793600,3,4751,4.619785458879619

2997496,2,B000X1Z0BU,"Now don't get me wrong, my two-star rating has nothing to do with the movie itself. Once was easily one of the best movies I saw last year, it is definitely one of the finest and most moving musicals I've ever seen, and has some of the finest music you will ever hear. My frustration lies in the U.S. DVD version of the film, specifically its audio.

I received Once as a Christmas present last year shortly after it came out on DVD. I went to watch it again and immediately realized the audio playback was wrong. It was half a step too slow, so all the songs were out of key and the voices sounded somewhat lower than when I first saw the film. I tried other DVD players and got the same result.

So I was disappointed, but I assumed that since the DVD had just been released this had just been an error in DVD authoring. Many DVDs have had to be recalled or reissued because of a glitch or mistake of some kind. So nine months later, the DVD is still circulating well and the movie is even being shown on HBO (and played perfectly in tune to boot), so I finally head back out and buy a fresh new copy of the DVD...and get the same result. The audio is still wrong, still flat, there are other DVD formats, a CD soundtrack and a TV broadcasting of the film offering sound evidence of an audio discrepancy, but nothing has been done about it.

This is why I'm so frustrated. I love Once, and I want to see it in its finest musical form. Too bad I live in the U.S. which just happens to get the short end of the stick in the audio playback department. My advice to any other U.S. viewers, watch the movie on HBO or watch the DVD on one of those players in which you can actually adjust the audio pitch on the disc playback by half steps. Or just hope that the DVD is some day rereleased and something is finally done about this. What a frustrating setback for an excellent film.",1220572800,8,1877,4.1652892561983474

For those that say, Glen Hansard can't sing ... we'll he a professional musician and has a band - the director was actually band mates with him at one point.

The movie is not a love story in the sense that the two main characters will fall in love. The movie is more about a man who had his heart crushed and is trying to get back on his feet and find the motivation to get his musical career going and Marketa Irglova's character provides that motivation.

Their musical education differs (he seems to be self-thought, while she is classically tranied pianist), and so does their social status but that is not barrier to their mutual musical creative force.  Their professional relationship grows thru their mutual respect for their musical talent but soon they are falling for each other emotionally to.  He has been hurt before with disasterous consequences it seems, while she has had her own share of misfortune of a different kind.  Can these two be together?  See the movie and make a decision for yourself!  The real treasure of this movie is young Marketa Irglova.  Her wide open eyes transcent innocence and purity that is rarely seen on film.  While Glen Hansard sometimes seems like he is trying too hard to make people love his music, Marketa's mere presence in the film, her subdued singing and performing give this little movie a real spark.

The music started off pleasant enough in Once and eventually it wore me down along with the slow pace of the film. I always give a flick at least a half an hour and I barely made it with this one. The music just hurt the film and my ability to stick with it.

The other thing is that it is purely a ""chick flick"". My wife and daughter doted on every word and nuance. If you're female and want a love story, this may be for you. If you're a guy, let her watch it alone.

  Irglova is the definition of adorability, and Hansard's new material (and reworked Frames material) is so soulful and heartfelt, I had to rethink my prior opinions.

I have shown it to audiences of 12-18 year old kids who sat riveted through the whole thing, (very mild) adult content and all, when three years ago they'd have been watching cartoons.  If you love gentle romance, music, Ireland or any combination of the three, I cannot recommend ONCE highly enough.  The one suggestion I would have, especially in showing it to others who don't hear a lot of Dublin accents, is to turn on the English subtitles.  It really helps to know exactly what they're saying when they get going fast or the crowd noise rises.

BUT MAKE SURE YOU CAN LISTEN TO THIS MUSIC

The first time the guy and girl sit down to do a song together, it seems pleasant enough.  It's a bit histrionic and repetitious, but there is one good section of lyrics.  But, at least for my wife and me, thereafter, the music was all but intolerable.  It struck us as tedious, with lyrics that are juvenile at best.  You hear much of the same song over and over and worse, every other song employs the same tortured singing.

Well, the moral of the story here is that if you like small movies with not entirely predictable plots points and utterly decent folk as characters, this is a wonderful, four-star movie

IF YOU CAN STAND THE MUSIC.

Neither my wife nor I could and we have widely divergent tastes in music.  Listen to the first song on the soundtrack at least three times.  If you still like the song after that -- and like small movies, you will likely join the significant list of critics who raved about this movie.

2997526,5,B000X1Z0BU,"When I originally purchased this film, I based my decision on looking at the customer reviews; that's how I purchase almost any film nowadays (or anything else, really).  However, I wasn't truly impressed with the movie, at least from previews, and thought it to be just another love story; it just happened to be well-written.

The opening sequence, for lack of a better way of putting it, opened my eyes.  I'd watched several musicals in past, and wasn't particularly interested in another, but Once came highly recommended, and the first song in the film proved why.  I was simply awestruck by how powerfully moving all of the music was of the entire movie, and immediately purchased the soundtrack as soon as I could find it.  I now have owned the movie and soundtrack for three months, and can't stop listening at least once a week.

Glen Hansard has one of the most haunting voices I've known, and after having heard it on the soundtrack, I went out and got all of the Frames albums I could find.  His range is one of the best I've ever heard, especially in Once.  Marketa Irglova is wonderful as a solo singer/songwriter, as well as a duet partner, and I've so far found at least three projects she's been involved in.  Both artists are incredible singers in their own right, but by including them both in this movie, someone has done something impossible: make a musical seem like it's a wonderfully felt story, not a production.  I would easily say it's on par with Rent and Across the Universe in it's musical talent, and with Reign Over Me in simply how poignant love, loss, and renewal can be.

The song that has the strongest meaning for me was ""When Your Mind's Made Up"", if only for the chorus, and how it conveyed the immediacy of demanding a decision on the part of the spurned lover.  This is, of course, followed by the fan favourite ""Falling Slowly"" because of how you could feel the love of the singers through the words ""Take this sinking boat and point it home / We've still got time"" in the chorus.

To close as best as possible, I easily recommend this film to anyone who wants a new movie to watch.  I'm a guy, and stereotypically I don't watch ""chick flicks"", but this movie is more than that; it's for anyone who loves music, and how that music can affect their lives.

It only took one time, but after having seen this film with someone I cared about, I'm convinced it's perfect as can be; it said everything I couldn't, simply because words alone can't do it.

This is the best movie for anyone who can't find the words for what they know to be true, and especially for anyone who loves music and film.  It deserves all the awards it gets.",1210377600,2,2669,4.492753623188406

2997529,4,B000X1Z0BU,"Once is another movie that my friends got me really excited to see. (Previously, I had been told that Reign Over Me was better than a ten point scale could ever express. Big disappointment).

First off, I hate musicals. I say this never having seen an entire one. That being said, this is not the type of musical that has actors spontaneously bursting into song. Rather, it almost seems like a documentary on a songwriter.

By this, I mean that Once really gives an excellent feel of Dublin and its locals. When they are singing, it isn't because they are in a movie that is a musical; instead, it is because they're all... well... musicians. Each time a song is played, it seems extremely realistic.

Therein lies an interesting part of the movie, though. Even though the singing seems very natural, it also serves to develop the story -- not by explaining plot, but by explaining the history and feelings behind characters. This can be tough, because you're almost obligated to try to decipher the songs. As soon as I started just enjoying the music without trying to comprehend lyrics, I thought -- shoot! -- I'm missing dialogue.

The initial meeting of the guy and the girl is awesome. The actors (or musicians) truly click, and the viewer sees what could be the start of any romance in any other Hollywood flick. The not-quite-romance is a joy to watch begin. But, it never seems to get past this initial point.

If one of the movie's taglines is in regards to how often you find your soulmate, then I really wish that point had been pushed harder. While they were cool to watch with each other, I never got the sense that the guy and the girl were meant for each other. For whatever reason, in my mind, I was comparing the couple to the couple in Good Will Hunting. In that movie, I really got the sense that Will would have fought for his girl. Not in Once. Maybe with some expanded run time, this could have happened.

Oh -- I thought of a better example. Johnny Cash & June Carter in Walk the Line. The initial meeting is just as cool as the one in Once, but the viewer really sees the relationship develop into something where both Johnny and June are willing to fight for one another. In Once, honestly, I just feel like the guy and girl are wondering ""what could have been,"" instead of pursuing being together. Maybe that was the point of the movie.

All considered, Once is definitely worth a watch. Rather than watch it again, though, I would be more likely to listen to Glen & Marketa's album (which is called The Swell Season).

2997539,5,B000X1Z0BU,"An Irishman (Glen Hansard) in Dublin is a vacuum repairman by trade, but musician by heart and he plays his songs on the streets.  There he meets up with a Czech immigrant (Markta Irglov) they strike up an easy friendship over their love of music and of course, a broken Hoover.

Over the next couple of days they share their music, write songs together, and then eventually record an album.  All the while they are building a friendship that borders but never crosses to romance because of his love for an ex and her rocky marriage.

The music was written and performed by the actors and the result is magical.  As I sit here typing this review, the songs are happily playing in my head; memorable melodies and haunting lyrics. The credits had barely started rolling when I hopped online to order the soundtrack.  He plays guitar and has a voice that is sexy and powerful.  She plays the piano and has a voice that is sweet and angelic.  Together they are superb.

There is something so sensual about really good music, the way every note and word can touch every inch of your soul and take over your heart.  I was literally moved to tears by a few of the songs in this film, not because they were sad, though some were, but because they were so beautiful, so perfect.

Every ONCE in a blue moon I will watch a film that will captivate me from the start and stay with me long after it's over.  This is one of those films.  It touched me on so many different levels and evoked so many different emotions and thoughts.  I will watch this movie, listen to its soundtrack, repeatedly, and never tire of it, because it's just that good.

The storyline is bittersweet and eloquent; a modern day musical about two people at a crossroads in their lives when they meet.  Each one gives the other one the shoulder and the shove they need to get on with and get what they want out of life.  A simple, but magnificent film with amazing music and actors; the result is unforgettable.  Brilliant.

You don't have to check the rational side of your brain at the beginning. You come away thinking, that really could have happened in life. Glen lives and works with his widowed father who owns a vacuum cleaner repair service. He has also just broken off a romantic relationship with a girl who is still living in London. He wants to be a full time musician and in his spare time he plays in the downtown area on the streets of Dublin. Marketa and her infant daughter live with her widowed mother in a small apartment. We learn she is estranged from her husband (still living in the Czech Republic) and it just wasn't working out. She sells flowers and other small items on the streets to support her small family. They meet on the street when she listens to one of his songs and strikes up a conversation. She, too, loves music and 'borrows' a piano at the local music store during lunch because she can't afford a piano of her own. They find they have a shared passion for writing and creating music. A relationship starts to develop. Where will it lead? Is it more than just music? Is this the ONE chance for both of them to fulfill their dreams together?

The ending is a delightful surprise, and the movie has leaped ahead to my all-time favorites!",1207353600,,381,4.9375
2997546,5,B000X1Z0BU,"I did not have high hopes for this film. It is mercifully short (85 minutes), which almost merits a star by itself -- filmmakers today cannot just tell a story and be done with it. They think they must add layers and drag it on for over two hours.

The movie opens on a street corner somewhere in Ireland. A guy with a guitar is playing his modern folk tunes (what we'd now call ""indie music"") with his guitar case open for tips and contributions. After an altercation with a druggie who tries to steal his guitar case, cut to the nighttime, when he is wailing out a very personal song of woe, strumming loudly and emphatically. A young woman walks up and throws ten pence in his case, asking him if he wrote the song. An acquaintance is struck -- she is a Czehk immigrant who sells flowers on the street and does domestic cleaning. He's a vacuum cleaner repair man by day, working in his Dad's shop. But they both love to sing/play music, and dabble in writing it. Over the course of a couple of weeks, they work together to flesh out some songs he's written and record them, as the guy starts moving seriously toward trying to make it in the music biz.

This film is one of the most charming things I've seen in years. It is a small film, a simple story about simple people with dreams, struggling with heartache and poor circumstances, who create something together, and in the process learn a bit about themselves and find a sudden, new, and deep friendship and love. It is amazing how authentic and real it comes off, amazing because this was a tiny movie, probably shot on video instead of film, cheap to make, with unknown actors. Yet Hollywood cannot seem to make a film that takes the audience into a friendship with living, breathing, real characters that you can't help but have immense affection for by the time the final credits roll. I can't say it never happens, but usually I'm painfully aware of contrivances and manipulations, poorly disguised.

The central theme of the movie, the core around which everything revolves, is The Guy's songwriting and The Girl's collaboration with him in creating and performing it to make a demo recording. It is not really my kind of music. It is the music of simple feelings, performed by people who do not have perfect, trained voices. Forgive my Irish, but I'd call it ""sad b*stard music,"" because it's about heartache and longing and misunderstanding and reaching out for connection and love. The melodies are sometimes pretty, but it's main virtue is that it is sincere, if not often very poetic (by my standards). The great thing about it is that you can believe that these characters could write these songs, because they aren't that sophisticated. (Unlike the recent August Rush, where a child who has never played an instrument suddenly becomes a performing and composing prodigy. Talk about a leap.)

And that's what stands out about this movie. Sincerity. Hard to find in a modern motion picture. I may not watch this multiple times, but I found it very moving, in a positive way.

There is some bad language, perhaps authentic, but totally unnecessary. This could easily be redubbed and turned into a PG or even a G film.",1207094400,2,3185,4.6300884955752215
2997547,5,B000X1Z0BU,"I loved this movie which is driven by fabulous words, music and relationships.  The music and songs blended perfectly with the script and enhanced our emotions.  I could feel the joy, pain and everything in between.
I was appreciative of the effort to develop and grow each participant for their own sakes.  Boy and Girl did not end up together, which would have been very cliche, but ended up where they wanted and perhaps needed to be.  What is wrong with that?
I loved the father/son interplay. Although a small part it was telling of the character of the boy and a big credit to the generosity of the father.

2997549,5,B000X1Z0BU,"This is definitely a very charming movie and gem not to be missed.  However, I would not encourage this for those looking for a ""musical"" or a sappy romantic film.  It follows the path of an young Irishman still feeling the pain of loss from the breakup with his girlfriend.  A young Czech immigrant encounters him playing guitar on the streets of Dublin, befriends him and they build a bond centered on music and their passion for it.  I won't give away any more details aside from that basic plotline.

Suffice to say, all aspects of this film fit together perfectly.  The film is shot in a very low budget fashion, capturing both the grittiness and revival of Dublin.  The acting is first rate, both lead and supporting cast and the music is both a perfect complement to the characters relationship and the overall tone and feel of the filmmaking.

This is a new type of romance film where the music is not only great, but is also the star and tells us the story. The music itself is a lead character in this movie. This newfound friendship is the motivating force in pushing his music career. I like that the movie also gives us a small glimpse into the creative process of the music.

It is hard to believe these two are not actors for they were so natural. It may be because they are musicians, so they were just acting naturally.

2997584,5,B000X1Z0BU,"""Once"" is such a lovely film... We finally sat down to watch it and, like so many others, were enchanted by the odd, intangible chemistry between the two lead actors, and by its fascinating glimpse into the creative process.

If you enjoyed the film's presentation of how music is made, and how creative people collaborate, there are a couple of other films that come to mind that capture some of the same vibe. One is a bit silly, teh other is more profound:

""Music And Lyrics,"" with Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore, is the silly one. I really liked even though it's so fluffy -- but the scenes where they collaborate on the songs are key to their characters and their relationship, much like similar scenes in ""Once.""

""Tribalistas"" - this DVD documentary of the making of the ""Tribalistas"" is utterly thrilling.  The film features Brazilian pop stars Marisa Monte, Carlinhos Brown and Arnaldo Antunes and shows them recording an album from start to finish. If you liked the creative scenes in ""Once,"" and wished there were more of that in the film, then track the Tribalistas video down -- it's one of the purest documents of musicmaking and creativity I've ever seen. Truly amazing.  Anyway, that's my two bits.  (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide to Brazilian Music)",1203638400,,1266,4.784403669724771
2997585,5,B000X1Z0BU,"This is not your typical Hollywood movie.  The music is amazing and the acting very raw and real.  It's not for those who like the conventional ending to a movie.  It was a very decent (which was a nice surprise), inspiring movie.  One that I will watch again and again.  I have already downloaded the music from the soundtrack.",1203552000,3,328,4.491525423728813
2997586,3,B000X1Z0BU,"Writer/director John Carney's charming little Irish musical ""Once"" gained steady critical favor since its quiet release into American theaters last year. Now with an Oscar nomination for Best Original Song (and win since this review was first written) its exposure has become more widespread, with its soundtrack selling consistently. Starring two musicians with scant previous acting experience - the Irish Glen Hansard and Czech Marketa Irglova - the film is acutely distinct in that its two principles write and perform the entire score themselves, telling the stories of their respective characters and how their lives intertwine.

Emphasis on the value of dreams and loose nature of love imbues the plot, with an understated pathos informing the nature of the characters. In fact, Hansard and Irglova's roles are simply that of Guy and Girl so as to keep things universal. The film has a well-defined charm and niche appeal, but it also wallows in overly sugary romanticism and trite, self-congratulatory art. At least to a degree. If movies could be desserts, ""Once"" would be a creme brulee with its hard, crunchy surface of pure sugar and silky custard underneath - although it leaves a good taste, the film clearly take itself too seriously. Presentation outdoes substance.

They may not be trained actors, but Hansard and Irglova are innately endearing with strong screen presence, amplifying Carney's story beyond its rightful realm. Because of this even their most whiney, pedestrian compositions benefit from their cinematic context. If this Guy or Girl were your friends in real life you'd probably encourage them and attend their coffeehouse gigs, yet you would also likely furrow your brow if they sold more than 100 copies of their latest demo. That is not to say that their music is of poor quality. It's not. But grabbing a guitar and howling at the moon about a love gone wrong turns stale pretty fast. Self-pity is not an art form in and of itself, regardless of the fickle taste of late 2000's record buyers. Only listeners with unrefined palettes will find anything offered here groundbreaking.

The romantic subtext of the film is well executed because of the characters' clear mutual respect and understanding of each others' different walks of life. Irglova may be half Hansard's age, but that does not compromise the film's integrity. The Guy may be a cliched out of work musician with a job in his father's vacuum repair shop, busking the streets of Dublin in hopes of making spare change, but the way he meets the Girl is engaging and believable. The journey the kindred spirits embark upon never fails to entertain in spite of the tunes, which are mildly enjoyable at their best. No back button required.

It is not the revolutionary musical masterpiece some have made it out to be, but ""Once"" is still worth a rental for those keen on romance or all things Irish. Ultimately it smacks more of cuteness than of high art, but what's wrong with that?",1203465600,3,2977,4.983903420523139

After watching the film you will probably want to find more of the amazing music by The Frames and Glen Hansard - you know where to find it. There is an excellent interview/live set available online with Glen Hansard and The Frames which was done by the incomparable David Dye at WXPN's World Cafe Live in Philly last May.",1203206400,3,644,4.495726495726496
2997588,5,B000X1Z0BU,"If you are in the mood for a gentle, endearing movie, then ""Once"" is a gem. Realistic dialog, believable situations, acting that is entirely natural (likely to happen when the leads aren't actors but actual musicians!) in a story that isn't forced. If you want a Hollywood fairy tale, this is not for you. It is a modern musical in that songs are used in their entirety and to advance the story rather than just being relegated to the background soundtrack; the music and lyrics depict the emotions of the leads and are the heart and soul of their relationship.

Thank God for Sundance which lets independent films like this find the audience they deserve.

Once the DVD was in my computer there was no easily apparent free song.  After awhile fishing around I found a readme buried several levels deep on the disc.

It says:

""PC users should find that the ROM content menu automatically launches when the disc is inserted into their DVD-ROM drive""

""MAC users may access the ROM content menu by double clicking the index.htm file or by dragging it to their favorite web browser window.""

Once the Mac user finds the index.htm file (in another directory) and opens it in their browser, then clicks the download song link, it does not work.  I found the song on the DVD in a .zip file, which when expanded can be dragged into iTunes.  Though note that it is a PC .wav format, which only plays in the most recent versions of iTunes.  From there it can be converted to an Apple uncompressed .AIF, or compressed .AAC or .MP3 formats.

2997594,2,B000X1Z0BU,"This movie is boooooooooooooring!  It doesn't at all know what it wants to be--a musical or a comedy--but it fails at both big time!

Because when I see a musical I want my feet to start a tappin' from scene 1, and that something that all the great musicals like Mary Poppins and other junk do.  Also a musical like West Side Story knows how to tell a story and create memorable, unforgettable tunes, weaved around the story that is so great.  I haven't seen West Side Story, but I understand the caliber of the film, trust me.  But as far as the musical numbers in Once go, all I can say is: WHINY MELODIES and PUTRID HARMONIES!  I know they say the musical is dead and there haven't been any good ones in about 40 years since Mary Poppins, but still they should try a lot harder.

As far as the comedy part goes, this movie is no Animal House.  What's great in Animal House is that it's a bunch of losers, but they're in a way treated like winners because we identify with them from the very outset of the film.  Who hasn't felt like an outcast and wanted to start a food fight, or put a horse in a classroom, or sabotage a parade?  I know I have.  And John Belushi, at the height of his fame, was outstanding as the fat guy in Animal House.  Also keep your eyes peeled for a cameo by Stephen Furst!  Sure some may call it college humor, but Animal House has it all for everybody!!

Basically the problem with Once is that it doesn't really offer anything, and it does not know what it is or what its voice is.  I did not enjoy it, mark my words.",1202860800,4,1548,4.147651006711409

2997596,4,B000X1Z0BU,"Once tells an exceedingly simple story with enormous charm and heart and without a hint of guile.

She's also a hauntingly beautiful piano player and when the two of them begin playing music together their growing connection is a pleasure to watch. There are no melodramatic Hollywood style plot points to hang the story on, just a natural evolution of the relationship between these two likeable characters.

2997600,4,B000X1Z0BU,"With multiple film festival award wins (and a recent Oscar nod) and produced on a shoestring budget (in just 17 days), ONCE is an independent movie marvel. But this isn't what should draw you to it. The draw should be its quirky humor, its incredible music (nearly 2/3 of the film is entirely music), and its intimate portrayal of two people making music while forming a strong bond of friendship.

The main actor and actress aren't even given names; there's no reason to as this Guy (played by guitarist extraordinaire Glen Hansard) and Girl (pianist Marketa Irglova) could be anyone off the street. Anyone with an incredible gift for music, that is. Both Guy and Girl work differing jobs than their hearts desire, Guy as a Hoover vacuum cleaner repairman and Girl as a house cleaner. But both have aspirations toward music, Guy more than Girl ...initially. Guy, on his off-time from the Hoover shop, panhandles on a street corner, belting out known songs during the day and his own at night (when no one's around). Girl discovers him and asks him why he doesn't play his own music during the day, and thus starts a series of events that speed this short film to a satisfying conclusion. I say ""speed"" in the sense of how short and sweet the film is, not because it is an action or speedy-type film in any way, shape, or form. In fact, if you were going to ding the film for anything, it would be its pacing. Sometimes achingly slow, the story nearly stalls at several points, but thankfully never falters completely.

The music is what makes Once what it is, and rightfully so. This is a story about musical wishes and dreams, and how those dreams should never be let go of no matter what the circumstances. Sometimes it takes a wallop upside the head to get you back to your dreams, and Girl is exactly the smack Guy needed in order to accomplish his. Her enjoyment of his songs and her persistent requests to hear more and more from him drive Guy to higher and higher levels. Although much of Guys' songs are based around a former relationship gone sour, it is Girl that opens his eyes to the fact that he still loves his girlfriend and his music ...and this awakening is all thanks to a platonic relationship with a stunningly pretty Czech (Girl).

Although Girl gives Guy what he needs, he too gives her something in return. Both come to understand how important their friendship is and what it will eventually mean to them, even should their dreams fail. Chasing after them no matter what the cost becomes all too evident as the film winds to a close.

You can't comment on Once without noting its camera work, too. It is very amateurish, almost as if someone were filming an episode of Wayne's World (in Wayne's basement). But it is the amateurish nature that binds the audience to the characters. You feel like you are the camera, peeking at these peoples' intimate lives from behind this corner or through that window.

And the music; it's impressive in the extreme, so much so it got nominated for Best Achievement in Music via the Oscars this year (2008), something of a shock for such a low budget film (much smaller than any previous nominee). Glen Hansard has ""the voice"" and his co-actress, Marketa Iglova, is no slouch either. Both are musical talents that can make you laugh one minute and nearly bring you to tears the next. And since over 60% of the film is music, that's a very good thing. In fact, for Once, it's the only thing.",1202428800,4,3450,4.576051779935275

2997605,4,B000X1Z0BU,"I've picked the DVD box up and turned it over at least ten times since the DVD release of Once. Finally I rented it.

Once is not a film for mere observers looking for light-hearted entertainment. Instead it's one of those movies that requires an emotional connection. Unless you regularly watch foreign films, you might want to tread carefully because this film is very typical of the slower story telling pace. If you are looking for a love story and a date movie, you are likely to be disappointed. But if you love fragments of reality in literature, art and song, you may find Once very fulfilling.

Once is a character study of two lonely people, both heart-broken in love, and by life. It's almost as if the camera follows them documentary-style through the humdrumness of their lives. But they spark as they connect over shared dreams -- music.

There is a poignant heaviness that colors the film a little drab. The song lyrics weave brokeness through simple folksy flavored acoustic melodies.

If you aren't certain, rent it before buying. Read all the reviews. If you hated Lost in Translation or didn't get it, Once isn't for you. If you hate dialogue, normal activities of daily living and little action, this movie is not for you. But if you seek the human condition and delight in rekindled dreams, check it out.

One warning. It's rated R for language and the F-bomb is frequent flyer. Usually it makes cluster appearances during tense scenes rather than being peppered throughout.",1202342400,,1495,4.801556420233463

The realistic portrayal of 2 people who briefly meet, flirt with the possibilities of romance, and then create music is not much of a story that would attract average American filmgoers, but if you let it take you there, you will be glad for the trip it takes you on. Set in modern Dublin, the film expertly captures the city and the role that music plays in the Irish heart. The music is absolutely astonishing and you will be amazed by the long sequence of music creation that is the heart of this film, and you might, as I did, be unable to get the tunes out of your head for weeks.
Rarely has the creative process been captured as well as in this production.",1202169600,,705,4.30827067669173
2997610,5,B000X1Z0BU,"I have to say, before I begin, that a great resonance of this film for me was the fact that it evoked my own musical past.  A Boston-based musician ""back in the day"" (WAY back!) I lived many of the same moments as ""He"" does in the film.

That said, this is essentially a boy-meets-girls story, the twist being that He and She are both musicians.  But unlike most Hollywood-driven stories of this genre, the relationship is only a secondary focus.  Rather, it is the music that is at center stage...and what music it is.  Simple, real, and from the heart, it is the music and its development that carries the story forward.

The two leads, He and She (for neither we nor they actually ever learn the characters' names) are played superbly by Glen Hansard and Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute;, non-actors, but also real life friends and musical collaborators.  He is played with earnest honesty (Hansard is essentially playing himself), and She is portrayed as whimsical, slightly ethereal, and strong-yet vulnerable.  Yet the lack of a Hollywood ham-fisted touch is clearly evident not only in the low budget, almost documentary style of John Carney's spot-on direction, but also in the evolution of the characters' story.  For while this is clearly a love story, it does not follow standard Hollywood protocol.  Indeed, there is no seal-the-deal first kiss, no sex, and the two characters do not set off into the sunset together.  Instead, they come together, enrich one another's lives, and then follow their individual paths...wherever those may lead.

But this is not to say that the story or the film is lacking, for in place of the usual detailed unfolding of an intimate relationship to rivet the audience's attentions and emotions, here we get to witness the unfolding of the music, as ""His"" songs are slowly transformed from solo street ballads into remarkably listenable arrangements by a pick-up band of nameless street musicians...and recorded ""simply because.""

It was in watching this unfolding that I was personally the most captured, because I have known the wonder Hansard perfectly captures and portrays as he first hears Irglov&aacute; accompany him on one of his songs.  I have lived the rush he experiences when his little accidental band suddenly transforms his solo efforts into something that somehow magically exceeds the limits of its own creation.  And I also lived through looking in the mirror, as He does, and realizing that all of his musical efforts ultimately spring from a crushed spirit.  While it is never explicitly touched upon in the movie, I wondered, as He goes off to apparently reclaim the track his life SHOULD have taken, whether he was wondering, as I did, whether his muse would leave once the hole in his spirit was healed and his heart was restored.

But perhaps I am projecting too much of my own story on this wonderful film, a movie that people may read into, but which certainly needs no help in touching the heart, the emotions, and the soul.  Well done!",1201737600,,3004,4.903162055335969

2997621,5,B000X1Z0BU,"In an age where the big budget Broadway style musicals are racing onto the screen, it's a simple low budget musical that's the real charmer.  Once looks like minimalist art cinema at first glance - hand held shots, documentary style film making.  No elaborate stages, special effects or gorgeous technicolor that encompasses the modern musical.

Rather, the film simply tells the story of a chance meeting between an unnamed man and unnamed woman who seem to share only a love for music and a lack of monetary affluence.  Yet thrugh music, their aspirations seem to grow, as does their relationship.  Despite the lack of grandiose compositions in the broadway fashion, the songs direct the course of the characters and are the cornerstone of the film, as it has little dialogue.

Glen Hansard has been making music for years and has been featured on film in the past in the Committments, yet doesn't strike you as an actor.  But it's the naturalistic approach of his and Marketa Irglova's performance that makes the film so great.  It feels like we're feeling and following the passion of these two characters.  Overall it's a lovely combination of filmaking technique, raw feeling, and an excellent enjoyable soundtrack that makes this film so great.",1201046400,,1251,4.975961538461538
2997622,5,B000X1Z0BU,"Once is an excellent movie about a touching friendship between a man and a woman simply named Guy and Girl. Guy (Glen Hansard) and Girl (Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute;) meet when Girl stops to listen to Guy playing songs on his guitar for money on the street. Guy and Girl form a singularly beautiful relationship and the plot moves along very nicely.

Guy and Girl come to know each other very well in a very short span of time--barely more than a week. Girl wants Guy to pick himself up and realize his dreams. She encourages Guy to make recordings of his songs with a band for a commercial CD so Guy can have fame as a musician. Guy seems confused as to whether or not Girl loves him; and there's a very well done scene in which Guy asks Girl to spend the night with him but she leaves.

Girl, of course, has her own issues. Girl, her mother and daughter are in Ireland because Girl's relationship with her husband didn't work out. Girl likes spending time with Guy; she likes getting attention from a nice man and she eventually helps him in his recording sessions.

Of course, from here the plot can go just about anywhere. Will Guy and Girl consummate their relationship? Will Guy go back to his former girlfriend in London? What will Girl do to support her child and mother in Ireland? Is there any hope for Guy to make his CD a success? No plot spoilers here, folks--you'll just have to watch the movie to find out!

The cinematography works so well partially because the hand held camera helps to set the thoughtful mood for this movie. The choreography works wonders in the opening theft scene and other scenes as well.

The DVD comes with commentaries and a couple of interesting extras about how they made the film. Great!

Overall, Once is a fine movie that people will enjoy if they like thoughtful movies about people and relationships in real life. Guy and Girl are not rich; and we see how they must work to support themselves while yearning to break free and be full fledged artists. The action moves along nicely, too.

Not only is it a plausible unconsummated love story but the songs and their music will delight even the hardest heart. I went out and bought the Collector's Edition soundtrack the next day.

This movie reminded me of that time. The movie showed the openness and intimacy songwriters have in playing their songs for an audience. The hoover shop where the guy musician worked with his father looked like vaccuum repair shops in Iowa. The apartments were the apartments of people who lived by scratching out a living. The movie seemed universal to me. My favorite moment in the movie was the scene when the couple first played together in the music shop. I thought it was electric.

The music is integrated naturally within the storyline instead of being imposed from outside.  And what a wonderful choice, to have the actors be the very artists who wrote the music!  This works all the better and makes for such touching and tender scenes because the actors were in the process of falling in love during the filming.  There is a palpable chemistry between Marketa and Glen throughout, and at the end, you feel that you've experienced something truly rare, human, and beautiful.  And what can I say about the music that hasn't already been said?  These are gorgeously haunting melodies that will stick in your mind long after the movie is over.  A couple of the songs, Falling Slowly and If You Want Me, are Oscar contenders this year.

By the way, Marketa's character replies in Czech to Glen's question ""Do you love your husband?""  She says, ""Miluju tebe."" and then refuses to translate.  So, he never knows what she said.  You can look it up!  This and some other plot details that I won't go into lead me to disagree with some other reviewers here who say this movie is all about ""friendship.""

""Once"" is a story about a man and a woman who conduct a courtship almost entirely through song.  Music being the primary medium in which these two individuals move through life, it is only appropriate that they should express their love for one another through music as well.

Glen Hansard plays a struggling songwriter/musician whose recent, emotionally devastating breakup with the girl of his dreams now serves as the inspiration for most of his lyrics.  Marketa Irglova is a young woman who recently emigrated from the Czech Republic with her mother and daughter to begin a new life in Ireland.  She, too, is a composer of music, though she is less assertive and confident about exposing it to others than he is.  The two meet on the street one night while he is performing one of his original compositions and they begin a slow, tentative relationship based largely on their mutual love of music.

""Once"" is a beautiful, lyrical and heartbreaking film that has understandably garnered a passionate cult following since its release in early 2007.  It is an utterly unique and spellbinding work in which the music is every bit as important as the dialogue.  The plot, though basic and uncluttered, still manages to throw a few curveballs our way in an acknowledgment that romantic relationships do not always work out in the way we`d like.  Filmmaker John Carney keeps it as simple and intimate in his directorial style as he does in his writing, utilizing an unobtrusive and relatively steady handheld camera that nicely matches the rhythms and beats of the music playing in the background (and often in the foreground).  The scene in which the camera, in a single unbroken shot, moves ahead of Irglova as she strolls along the streets of the city singing an original composition is one of the truly transcendent movie moments of 2007.  And the music itself is lovely, flavorful and memorable - reason alone, I'd say, for seeing the film.

In addition to their obvious talents as singers and musicians, Hansard and Irglova give performances of such poignancy and subtle emotion that they draw us instantly into the hearts of their characters.

If ""Once"" reminds us of any film, it is probably the French classic, ""A Man and a Woman,"" another work whose tale of romantic love was intimately woven through music (although, in that film, the characters themselves were not singing or composing works).  That's not a bad template for a romantic movie, when you get right down to it.

Since ""Once"" is a film that it is much better to experience than it is to read about, I suggest you try it on for yourself.  You won't regret it.",1200182400,,2638,4.8137472283813745

To me the worst book I've ever read is better than the best movie I've watched. When I browse the Amazon bestseller list, I skip the movie category no matter what is hot in it. I was totally disappointed with these Hollywood potboilers. I hate wasting time in selecting-watching-being-disappointed format. I love music, I spend a lot of time on Amazon music section. As far as I can tell, since last summer, Once has been always in top 100, maybe top 50. But I didn't even try the sample, because I've never heard of Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova.

Yesterday, when I'm doing my routine browse on Amazon, the CD finally caught my eye. I clicked the link then found it was the music from the movie Once. I listened to the samples, then decided to watch the indie(though only 4.5 stars on Amazon, but the samples from OST added another .5). It's only 86 minutes, It won't take a long time.

I didn't budge an inch on my chair during the movie, even the credits began to roll. I couldn't even believe when It ended. How can it end so fast, what's next? The movie is just incredibly beautiful, I know that foreign movies are much better than Hollywood's(Whale Rider, Pan's Labyrinth, the Sea Inside), this one is another find in 2007, I just don't know how to simplify my feelings.

The story is simple, the friendship and chemistry between two main characters are convincing and touching, the performance was down-to-earth, no exaggeration, no special-effect of course, but full of warmness and sincerity. The music is passionate and delighting. So what else do you want for a movie about real life? Conspiracy? Ghost? Exploit?

The acting is strong, and while the cinematography is not as lush or polished as in more expensive films, it is just right for this story, and puts the emphasis on the characters where it needs to be.

They were real and with our hyper-entertainment real is boring for most but if you keep watching you will be drawn in. I loved the way that guy sang better at the end of the movie than at the beginning, girl inspired him and motivated him. That's what good relationships do, they make us better.

2997646,5,B000X1Z0BU,"There's something pure about `Once'.  Instead of taking the route of most films in this genre it steers away from the drugs and immoral clich&eacute;s of musician pieces and focuses on the passion behind the music, the experiences and emotions that drive these two individuals to create beautiful music together.  `Once' is truly a one of a kid film, a beautiful and mesmerizing musical journey that comes only once in a great while.

The story told is that of your classic boy meets girl story (or `guy' meets girl story) where we are introduced to a young man who plays music on the streets for money and fixes vacuums in his fathers shop, as well as a young girl who has a broken vacuum and a love for music.  They meet by chance but share a connection that no words can put into perspective for the audience.  It's through their music though that their connection is made manifest.  They are drawn to each other and we are drawn to them.  They fall in love, but a love that is not like most experienced in the cinema today, this is a pure love, a love of character and emotion, a love of human beings and not carnal desire.  This guy falls for this girl and she likewise falls for him because they share a common bond you don't share with just anyone.

The film takes place over the course of a week where are two companions decide to make a record together.  They buy the studio time, they rehearse and then ultimately they record their album.  That is your story, but the story runs so much deeper than that.  When I watched `Dreamgirls' last year I was fortified in my belief that singing can be the purest for of acting, but `Once' takes the feeling of `Dreamgirls' and carries it much further.  When we watch actors (and real life musicians) Glen Hansard and Marketa Iglova sing their songs (songs they themselves have written) we feel every ounce of emotion.  We feel compelled to respond to their calls, they pleads; their desires.  We are taken deep into their souls.

One thing to notice when watching `Once' is that neither our main actor or our main actress is given a name.  This to me makes it all the more relatable.  These two could be anyone in the world, they could be you or I or our friends.  By not giving them a title other than `guy' and `girl' they become even more understandable and accessible.  I truly adore this aspect of the film.

As a longstanding fan of the Irish pub music made popular by the amazingly talented Damien Rice I was thrilled to see Glen Hansard do this film.  His musical style is breathtaking and warm and he delivers a very strong performance for someone who is not a quote-unquote `actor'.  Marketa Irglova also delivers beautifully.  Both are very natural and convincing, portraying real people, no gimmicks or dramatized emotions.  They add to the pure quality I mentioned on the outset.  This movie feels real; it feels natural and graceful and in the end attains all my respect and admiration.  One of the best films of the year, most definitely.",1200009600,,3004,4.5353159851301115

At the end of the film, I was dissapointed. Was that it? Were they not going to consemate their love for each other? Did they love each other? Wait, the lead characters were never given a name?!

 Maybe I was a little slow the night I watched it, but it took a little thinking afterwards to completely understand the movie, or at least take it the way that I did.

 The story of Once can be summed up by saying that Guy meet Girl and they make music together. That's what it was the second after viewing, but an hour or so later, I realized that their love was shown. It was shown the only it could have been shown, and that was through the music they made together.

 After it clicked for me, I smiled. John Carney has written a sort of forbidden love story using music. The interactions given by our leads, Glen Hansard and Markta Irglov, are near perfection. The whole vacuum bit had me sold for Girl.

 In the end, the whole tone of the film left a bittersweet feeling. I felt for Guy and Girl. I felt for the lack of their love. They'll always have their music. And great, great music it is.",1199664000,3,1257,4.2301255230125525

Chalk full of emotion, the lyrics and both the male and female voices have a transcending quality that stops you in your tracks and insists you listen.

The characters (guy and girl) are understated, modest, and very real. There doesn't seem to be any acting going on, but it's a little like a documentary. He, the guy, is a guitarist, a singer-songwriter, singing for his supper in the off-hours of his job as a vacuum cleaner repairman. She, the girl, is Czech, a pianist, likes his music and happens to have a ""Hoover"" in need of repair. He sings on the streets, she sells flowers on the streets. Their ultimate meeting is not remarkable, but their unlikely coupling as a musical duo is. When they first sing together, there's immediate harmony. With the girl as muse, they find their way down a musical path and as I watched, I felt that no matter what was going to happen, everything about the film felt successful. It had a hand-made quality to it that felt believable.

Shot mainly on the recognizable streets of Dublin, it's all very Irish and utterly charming. Highly recommend.

For me, the movie was entertaining, realistic (non-Hollywood blockbuster), and the music was inventive, heartfelt, and sorrowful.

A movie of this type is normally done as a ""slice of life"" without much of a beginning or ending, but this movie has some inciting forces, movement, and subtle closure.

You probably need to be somewhat of a music fan to enjoy this movie, but I ended up watching it twice (which I never do) in order to follow the progression of the songs.",1199664000,,581,4.732673267326732

The reason it has gotten more interest lately is probably because it is easy to relate to.  This film is very simple and has no big budget sets or halos on the characters.  Sometimes you need to escape into fantasy and sometimes you need to see hope in the everyday challenge of living and being broken hearted.  This is the latter of those two.  A great film if you like seeing something real without the predictable bedroom scenes and dark alley stuff where the nice people get hurt.  Great music! A film with substance yet no pretense of depth.

2997655,5,B000X1Z0BU,"A funny little Irish film on the birth and delivery of a music group and an album. It is the result of the chance meeting of a young guitar player singing in the street and a young pianist and slightly composer just passing by and listening. The meeting of the two, though starting on a bad foot: ten cents in the street for one full song and later his more than lame proposal though he knew nothing about her. He will learn later she is Czech, married, has a child and is living in Ireland with her mother and her child waiting for her husband to join them. In spite of that a collaboration becomes possible and a full CD is composed, rehearsed, recorded and burnt in time for him to go to London to work with some producers. He invites her on his last night in Ireland and she accepts but will not come and his only farewell will come from his father. On the following morning he goes away but stops in a music store and has a piano delivered to her. End of story: the piano is delivered and used with the finally arrived husband. Charming story in which artistic gifts and desires are not always expressed, do not always find their way to some audience, and may be completely wrecked by some horny or kinky illumination. But when art leads beyond this skin deep impulse there can be a way to some achievement. In many ways a good Irish hence catholic film in which Catholicism is some kind of morality that leads to a certain life style.

2997656,5,B000X1Z0BU,"I was a bit sceptical when my girlfriend ordered this film on Netflix for us to watch thinking it was just going to be a complete ""chick flick"" but it was absolutely wonderful.  It's not a ""chick flick"", it's an ""Amature Musicans Flick"".  The film is so true to life about the thoughts, feelings, and emotions of an amature musicians who is just writing and singing from the heart.  Especially if you've been severely hurt by a significant other as I have, so I could very much identify with Guy's lyrics as they are very true to the heart.  There are three main reasons this film is incredible.

1) The music.  Simply put, the song writing in this film is incredible.  Being a musican myself, I understand how the music industry works (been offered more than one record deal so I'm no stranger to the industry) and I don't see these songs as selling out stadiums, but rather having a strong underground following like a Dunkan Sheik.  The songs are from the heart and very authentic.  At first I thought the lyrics were toying with being cliche, but they are put together in a manor that they don't quite cross over and actually end up being quite amazing.  They convey real feelings and real emotions in a way that is accessible for the veiwer to identify with and make them personal to their own experience.  For the true musician, music is life and lyrics are your soul.  I was moved to tears in the scene where the two main characters are in the music shop playing their first song together.  Not only is it amazing to hear how they come together but the lyrics to the song truly hit home.  All in all, great song writing and arangement.

2) True to life interaction.  The interaction between the two main characters is incredibly real to life.  I had something similar happen to me with a girl that just heard me playing/singing one day and we were inseprable for a short period of time playing music together and what not.  When you have the bond of music, it's a different type of interaction.  It's like you truly know someone and can see their soul.  You see that in the interaction between these two.  No secrets because you know that they won't hurt you.  It's just incredible and I think this film really captured that.

3) The ending.  The film truly leaves you wanting.  I won't say how it ends for those who haven't seen it, but the ending is true to what probably would happen in real life and it leaves you with such mixed emotions.

Definately a must see.",1199318400,,2474,4.466517857142857

I found myself enchanted by the beauty of the Girl.  I thought I had never seen such a lovely woman in films for a very long time.  The first duet at the music store is so natural and beautiful.  There is a scene at the recording studio when the Girl goes off and finds a grand piano.  The Guy comes in and asks her to play.  When you watch this scene pay attention to the Guy in the back ground as he listens to the Girl sing.  It is what is called acting. Acting at its most natural and is moving at the same time. I screamed at the ending.  I knew that there could be only one ending but... it hurt when the Girl looked out the window and the the screen went black.

2997664,5,B000X1Z0BU,"While this movie is often termed a musical, I think that is a misnomer. Yes, it is a film about two musicians, one male and the other female. Yes, music does play a prominent part in this film. Yes, there is one scene (on a bus as I recall) where the guy breaks into song when describing the love of his life to the girl beside him, someone relatively new in his life. Yes, there are lots of band rehearsals and all that.

But this isn't Grease or Hairspray or Les Miserables or even Sweeney Todd. It isn't THAT kind of musical. So I think the word doesn't do justice to the film. It is very watchable even for those who tend to hate musicals.

The plot, such as it is, focuses on a guy who is trying to figure out what to do with his life in the wake of a breakup. Along comes a rather chatty young woman who hangs out with him and the two hit it off. I don't want to mislead the potential viewer  so let me stress that ""hitting it off"" is not a way of saying there is high drama and passion.

The delight of this film is that it is low-key, intentionally so (if you get the DVD be sure and watch what the director says about the film). It isn't meant to be a typical Hollywood blockbuster but more of a slice of life film.

I loved it, absolutely,totally - as did my son. He liked the music a great deal, much of it vocal music. While I appreciated that, I also enjoyed the refreshing look at two people who were helping and supporting one another as they struggled to figure out how their lives had gotten off track - and where to go from there.

I think that gives you enough of a basis to figure out if the film is worth viewing. I'd urge you to see it. If you want high drama or suspense or a mystery thriller then don't take a chance on it. If you are up for a good film, nicely done, about two people and the normal ups and downs of life (especially as musicians), you're likely to enjoy this.",1198972800,5,1901,4.042553191489362

2997668,5,B000X1Z0BU,"It's a hard knocks life playing music on the sordid streets of Dublin, Ireland. ""Once"" opens with clear proof of that as our protagonist, Guy (Glen Hansard from the ""Commitments""), has to chase down a thief who's stolen his guitar case full of tips.

But not all of Guy's encounters are so negative.  By chance, he encounters 'Girl', a Czech immigrant who turns out to be a talented pianist.

They form a friendship.  Then they begin to perform together, which blossoms into a band and a CD. This is definitely not a romance. Guy's still trying to resolve an old relationship with a girl who left him and Girl's married with a daughter til near the end of the film.

What ""Once"" is is honest dialog between two people about their dreams, their lives.

All this and the music is wonderful as well.  It's a folky-bluesy theme written by the two co-stars.  What's interesting is that the music, like a character in itself, evolves through the film.

""Falling"" has received a great deal of radio play, particularly on my favorite Austin-based radio station.  The song that made me laugh was ""Broken Hearted Hoover Fixer Sucker Guy"".  Now, that is an original title and very much real life.  I'm adding the soundtrack to my wish list and if the spouse likes the film, I may well end up purchasing the DVD as well.

Warnings:

To me, both Guy and Girl are fairly easy to understand, but if you have trouble with accents, you may want to turn on closed captioning

2997670,1,B000X1Z0BU,"At Gitmo, one of the things the interrogators do to `break' prisoners is to subject them to prolonged exposure to songs from TV's Sesame Street.  It turns out that even when it's designed to be benign or even therapeutic, being forced to listen to certain music truly is torture.  Also at Gitmo, if a `detainee' tries to end his suffering by means of starvation, the U.S. military will force feed him so as to prevent this.

'Once' is a force-feeding of folk music.

The musical performances are characterized by an affected earnestness and a self-styled soulfulness.  They are self-conscious without being self-aware: in other words, a pre-ironic mindset.  Watching them made me uncomfortable in the way that one is uncomfortable when a nave, sensitive, and bad poet insists upon reading you his work and asking for feedback.

This film is photographed with a blurry, hand held camera, and to say that the script is minimalist is an understatement. It is possible to momentarily forget that this film is fiction, that someone scripted this.  In my opinion, this is a deliberate cheat, a gimmick to conceal the thinness, corniness, and improbability of the plot.

This is `The Blair Witch Project,' but with music.

There is a sense of arrested development with Glen Hansard's character, a self-pitying 36-year-old still living at his father's house.  It's creepy to know that when this movie was made, Marketa Irglova was just 18.  The pair are reported to `dating' nowadays, and it is reasonable to suspect that the relationship was probably not `platonic' when they were composing and performing together prior to filming.

In short, this film feels like the fantasy of a college sophomore, neglecting his classes in hopes that music will be his ticket out.  If you have ever wondered what it would be like to have a street musician move in with you, I strongly recommend this movie.

2997678,5,B000X1Z0BU,"Once is the street magician of musicals; its natural efficiency makes Dreamgirls look like Sigfried & Roy--a sparkling make-under of its genre, and a lovely sigh of a film.

I agree with the other reviewers that it resembles Before Sunrise in realistic style and pacing--except Once uses music in place of introspective conversation to achieve a sensory magic that only music can stimulate.  You don't even have to be a fan of this kind of music to experience the fullness of the story through it.

Amazon's clip of the two leads (played by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglov, neither of their characters is named) first harmonizing in the music shop is the perfect selection. It comes about 15 minutes in, and is where the film (by the director's own admission) really starts. It's a very tentative moment of connection through a song, itself of searching for connection, that evokes Trufaut's ""400 Blows"" in the way it brings the viewer into the equation. It's a brilliant sensory parallel: While listening to the music, experiencing each note and at the same time anticipating the next in the melody, the viewer also watches in wonderment and waiting, trying to understand what is going on between these two obscure people at that exact moment, and trying to detect what they will be in the moment after that.

The actors are both untrained, but it's neither evident nor non-evident in their performances. Sorry, that was a terribly composed sentence--what I mean is, while their performances are subtle and richly felt, they aren't ""naturals"" at acting; they ARE, however, naturals in their particular roles in this particular film.  They just fit, and everything about it just feels right somehow.  So much so that I wasn't at all surprised to discover that the lead actors were friends who met 6-7 years before, and that they began to see each other in a romantic light during filming. Hansard, 37, demonstrates an affecting hesitation and tentativeness around Irglov, who is 19, that is appropriate both for the plot, and the real-life fact that she is so young.

In the excellent commentary with the actors and director, the director notes that the original script called for a kiss, and Hansard refused and wasn't comfortable with it.  The grey area of romantic appropriateness befits the plot (the title denotes man's hesitation to act, waiting for ""Once this-or-that happens""), and makes the characters' interactions more interesting, striking a perfect balance between discomfort and harmony.

The fact that this was shot in 17 days for $175,000 is pretty amazing.  But, again, it seems to add to the film for the better, giving it an improvisational and true-to-life feeling.  The sets are real places in Dublin, adding to the sense that all this could've happened yesterday, and maybe it will happen tomorrow, you never know.

This is just one of those rare, rare movies where all the behind-the-scenes events and interpersonal relationships are so oddly, perfectly manifest in the finished product.

The DVD includes commentary by the actors and director on both the film and the songs.  Subtitles are accessible in English, Spanish and French so you can follow along the lyrics.  There are two brief but entertaining making-of-type featurettes as well.

My one gripe: The R-rating is truly puzzling. On what planet, MPAA?  There is no nudity, not even a kiss, and no violence.  Some strong language, but barely that.",1198195200,,3429,5.017636684303351
2997679,4,B000X1Z0BU,"""Once"" is an attempt at a musical for modern audiences, in which the characters express themselves through music but don't burst into song in places where it seems inappropriate. The two main characters are musicians, so it's natural for their feelings to be reflected in the songs they write. A street musician (Glen Hansard) in Dublin, Ireland sings popular covers by day and is trying out his own music on passersby at night when a friendly and somewhat impertinent street vendor (Marketa Irglova) stops to talk. It turns out that she is a classically trained pianist from the Czech Republic. The busker never had much ambition, but he is inspired by a fruitful collaboration with his new friend and finally motivated to record his music.

You may recognize Glen Hansard as the frontman for the Irish band The Frames. John Carney, who wrote and directed the film, was formerly a band member. His philosophy in casting was to get ""really good singers who can half-act"" instead of settling for actors with mediocre musical talents. Hansard and Irglova are not professional actors, so ""Once"" uses a lot of long lenses by necessity. It's shot documentary style with some handheld work, but only occasionally shaky. The awkwardness of the characters' relationship and the man's palpable frustration create a strong sense of realism. Ironically, the only thing that feels self-conscious and inauthentic is that we so rarely hear the characters names spoken. Several of the songs are quite good, and they do, indeed, seem natural in their context.

The DVD (20th Century Fox 2007): There are 4 featurettes and an audio commentary. ""Making a Modern Day Musical"" (12 min) interviews John Carney about his inspiration and approach, working on a micro budget, non-actors, and Glen Hansard about writing the songs. ""More Guy, More Girl"" (9 min) talks to the director and actors about the characters' relationship and audience reaction. ""Broken Hearted Hoover Fixer Guy"" (1 min) is a webisode animated with stick figures. ""Musical Commentary with writer-director John Carney and actor/musicians Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova"" takes us through the13 songs and fragments with commentary on filming and performing them. The audio commentary with John Carney, Glen Hansard, and Marketa Irglova comments scene-by-scene on characters, filming, the role of music, genesis of the project, locations, the director's intentions.

A Dublin busker (Glen Hansard) is a songwriter and singer who plies his music on the streets when his is not helping his warmly generous father (Bill Hodnett) in his vacuum repair shop: his songs reflect a ruptured love affair and are sensitively poignant.  Along comes a Czech girl (Markta Irglov) who sells flowers on the streets but is impressed enough with the lad's music to stop, listen, and even put ten cents in his case.  The two strike up a friendship (the girl plays the piano in a music shop during lunch hour) and in time these two bruised people interact in the wavelength of their love of music.  The lad meets the girl's daughter and mother (Danuse Ktrestova) - the father of the child is still in the Czech Republic -,  they all become friends, and with the help of a few fellow musicians they cut a recording that hopefully will launch the lad's career in a trip to London.  The mood of the extemporaneous feeling piece is one of developing love that can only happen once, especially given the histories of each of the two musicians.

Writer/director John Carney demonstrates how a simple story can be made into a touching film for under $150,000. and on a shooting schedule of 17 days.  The featurettes have just as much tenderness in outlining the production of the film as the film itself.  The only problem with the film for this viewer is the music, which seems redundant and repetitive: for those who favor this type of music this will not be a 'flaw'.  It is admirable that films like this are being made, restoring our faith in honest craftsmanship backed by warmth of intent. Grady Harp, December 07",1198108800,6,1965,4.522598870056497
2997681,2,B000X1Z0BU,"I am one of many people who have been changed by the movie ""Once.""  I saw the movie several times in the theater and I know the soundtrack in and out.  I was also fortunate enough to see the Swell season three times here in Chicago.  I am a musician and I appreciate the sincerity of the film and the way the songs told the story.

I just purchased the Once DVD(U.S. Version - NTSC), and the experience was ruined due to the fact that the movie seemed to be playing back slower than normal making all of the songs play in a lower key, and all of the actor's voices lower than normal.  I am not sure if this was noticed at the authoring house, but the final DVD is not true to the original recording.  I tried the DVD in several different players, and even returned the first DVD but still had the same result with the replacement.  I'm sure that many people will notice this right away.  I also didn't like the airbrushed hand holding that was added and retouched on the DVD cover.

I still love the film, but the DVD is not a good reproduction.",1198022400,36,1045,4.185

Fans of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Commitments-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00018D3XW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Commitments (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;should recognize the guy as he's played by Glen Hansard who played Outspan Foster, the guitar player in Alan Parker's motion picture. He has a great, emotional voice that comes through on the songs that he sings and is reminiscent of Richard Thompson. It gives the music a powerful punch and depth. He plays a character still haunted by a past relationship and this bleeds into his songs. Marketa Irglova brings a quiet, understated charm to her role. It's a wonderfully unaffected performance and the two of them have terrific chemistry together.

These two musicians compliment each other well, encouraging each other's musical ideas. Think of this film as The Commitments: Unplugged. Once is one of those rare films where the actors are actually playing their instruments and singing instead of aping along to someone else's music. Hansard and Irglova are the real deal and this only adds to the enjoyment of the film. Once is personal, heartfelt filmmaking at its finest and a world away from the big budget bombast of a film like Dreamgirls.

There is an audio commentary by writer/director John Carney and actor/musicians Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova. Carney tends to dominate this track as he talks about the origins of the film's title. Irglova talks about the challenge of finding her character early on in the shoot. Hansard talks about his days with Carney in the band, The Frames and how he knew that Carney would go on to become a filmmaker.

All three also provide a commentary for all of the songs in the film. Hansard says that they did the busking scenes early on a Sunday morning to avoid being recognized. They talk over each musical number, sometimes telling the origin of a song.

""Making a Modern Day Musical."" Carney says that audiences have connected with the film because of its personal, intimate approach. Originally, Hansard wasn't going to be in the film but Carney liked the rehearsal footage of him with Irglova.

""More Guy, More Girl"" features Carney talking about the initial idea he had for the film. Cast and crew talk about making it with plenty of on-the-set footage which gives some insight into the creative process. Everyone speaks fondly of the filmmaking experience.

""Webisodes"" features one of the songs from the film done to really low-tech, stickman drawing animation.",1197936000,2,2578,5.384615384615385
2997683,5,B000X1Z0BU,"But I had to this one time. I liked this movie alot, period. The story and the music combine for a believable tale of two people with loads of emotional baggage bringing out the best in each other. The story is probably familiar to many people, from those who have already lived it to those who dream the story will unfold for them at sometime in the future.

Given the opportunity to see Glen and Marketa performing as members of the Swell Season last month, I was amazed at how many people were touched by this movie. Based on the audience, the movie embraces people of all ages, from those still in their fundamental high school and college years to those who have experienced a bundle of springtimes. Perhaps it is all an act, but Glen and Marketa seem extremely genuine and seem to really enjoy making music together. What a great night that was.

I rarely offer advice, but I will break with tradition this one time. Please see this movie. There's a real good chance you'll enjoy it as I did. And perhaps you'll be writing your first review as well.",1197849600,5,1055,4.461139896373057
2997684,5,B000X1Z0BU,"Musical romances are tough to sell to today's audiences and they are usually awkward. Trying to make one as an independent feature minus all the Hollywood gloss and big production numbers is even tougher but then this film isn't your typical combination of music, drama and romance.

""Once"" manages to be both bold and marvelous at the same time. This delightful film tells the story of an Irish musician (Glen Hansard) who falls for a classically trained piano player and Czech immigrant (Marketa Irglova) who is living with her daughter and mother. The two discover a surprising musical compatibility as well in addition to their unexpected romance. A small independent release that disappeared from theaters as quickly as it opened, ""Once"" is one of those films that you can delightfully discover as it moves on to its second life on home video without feeling guilty about the quality.

Hansard who plays in the rock band Frames brings his character to life as much through song as he does through performance. Written and directed by Hansard's band mate John Carney, the film takes a bit to take off but once it does it soars. This isn't your fantasy musical however and Carney doesn't shy away from showing the hardship that two street musicians face in a world that largely gives them an unsympathetic ear.

The film looks quite good on DVD considering its low budget nature and feeling that it was shot on the fly. Audio sounds quite good as well with a crisp, clear quality that one might not expect on an independent film such as this.

We get an observant and intelligent commentary track by director Carney and his stars. They discuss everything from their characters in the film to making music. There is also a track specific commentary track with the trio as well. ""Making a Modern Day Musical"" is a very good featurette that focuses on the challenges that Carney faced with the musical genre as well as the difficulties he and the cast faced in trying to pull it off convincingly. ""More Guy, More Girl"" focuses on the unnamed main characters and their relationship. We also get the web featurette ""Broken Hearted Hoover Fixer Sucker Guy"" and the ability to download via your PC another web featurette which I didn't have time to review. Finally we get four trailers for unrelated but thematically similar films.

""Once"" is an absolute delight. It's unpretentious and focuses on what is missing from most modern day musicals--the characters, their relationship and their evolution vs. big production numbers and over-the-top tunes. The score is memorable as well and fans may want to pick it up. The DVD comes with some nice extras but, really, they are icing on an already rich cake.",1197763200,8,2699,4.845986984815618

Its entire too-short length is a romance, but not in the end the romance expected at the beginning.  Even more than the romance, it is about Dublin, about carrying on in fragile circumstances, and about giving oneself and others a second chance.  Those are, of course, themes more universal than individual, so it's entirely appropriate that the two protagonists are never named beyond Guy and Girl.  Even in that anonymity, however, they are finely drawn and portrayed individuals.  Once is a movie to see more often than its title.

2997701,5,B000X1Z0BU,"""Once"" is a real find. The story of a street musician who meets a Czech &eacute;migr&eacute; on the streets of downtown Dublin, is a believable, well-made film about love, dreams and making things happen.

Guy (Glen Hansard, a real musician who also appeared in the film ""The Commitments""), a street busker who sings his heart out on the streets of Dublin, works in his dad's vacuum repair shop. One day, a young lady (Marketa Irglova), a Czech immigrant, begins to ask him questions about his music, his passions, the inspiration for his ballads. They form a friendship and she encourages him to follow his dream and put together a demo album. As the friendship grows, she helps him negotiate a recording studio and practice the songs. In the process, she invites him into her home, to meet her mother and young daughter. During the course of their relationship, they grow closer, but she is still married and can't let anything happen. They round up some other musicians and begin to work on the demo, to help him with his dream.

""Once"", written and directed by John Carney, is a very intimate look at the relationship between these two people. A lot of handheld camera work, close shots and grungy, real locations help to give the film an incredible cinema verite look and style. The camera work is handheld, but not overly shaky, creating shots with an intimate, close appearance, really thrusting us into the middle of the action.

The relationship between Guy and Girl (as they are listed in the credits) is really an interesting one that draws you into their lives. Initially, the guy is a bit put off by the girl, she is extremely chatty and forthcoming, asking him a lot of questions about his music, why he sings certain songs, the inspiration, etc. As a street musician, he is naturally a little weary about people getting too close, he simply wants them to enjoy a little of the music and drop a couple of coins or bills into his guitar case and leave. So, the young woman who stops to ask questions, in her accented English, is a minor annoyance, until he realizes she is genuinely interested.

As their relationship grows, he feels a fondness for her, and as a single man, he naturally flirts with her. But when she realizes this is going too far, she gives him a little look, a minor reprimand, and he realizes she is right. They are friends, sharing an experience. And she is married, even if her husband still lives in the Czech Republic and they are having problems.

As they become friends, they become involved in each other's lives. He meets her mother and daughter, sees where she lives, has dinner at their house. She meets his dad and becomes involved in his making of a demo album.

When the duo shows up at the recording studio, with their fellow street musicians, the sound engineer greets them, but secretly reveals his true feelings to someone on his cell phone. He has a feeling this group is another example of people with too much ambition and not enough talent; they don't even know the technical details of recording the music. But when they start playing, he recognizes they have talent, the songs are good, and the lead singer, our guy, is quite good, so he becomes engrossed in making the demo as good as possible. He becomes a part of their team, investing part of himself in the production of the demo.

Part of the beauty of ""Once"" is that nothing seems forced. They don't have sex, simply to make the story more dramatic. In fact, the course of their relationship seems all the more real because they simply remain friends, close friends invested in each other's lives and livelihood. There aren't any manufactured crises involving her mother and baby or his dad. They simply struggle with real life.

Also, the music is quite good throughout the film. Guy sings a song, a love ballad he wrote for his girlfriend who moved away to London, a few times, each time making it a little better. Finally, when they record it for the demo, it is as good as it could be, with the girl playing keyboard and singing backup and the addition of the other musicians they have recruited.

""Once"" is a film about the guy following his dream. He wants to make a demo and travel to London, to try to get a contract. But perhaps more importantly, he wants to reunite with his girlfriend. All he needs is a little push, a little support and guidance from a friend. He finds that friendship with the girl, his new friend who helps him realize he should go for his dream.",1193616000,,4491,4.596754057428215

I went into the theater just expecting it to be yet another movie but it wasn't. It's a love story that anyone can relate to because the people involved are coping with real issues that get in the way of being with that one special person.

And the music... wow. Just... wow.",1193011200,,775,4.092105263157895
2997704,5,B000X1Z0BU,"This is one of those rare movies that defies any neat classification. It isn't a traditional love story by any stretch. Though it is filled with music from beginning to end it isn't really a musical. In the traditional musical characters will suddenly burst into song but it represented an interruption in the otherwise semi-realistic tone of the movie--think of Gene Kelly in SINGIN' IN THE RAIN. But all the songs in this film are in line with the overall realism of the film, they are all songs that occur in normal life.

I don't want to reveal much in the way of details about the movie since much of the joy of the film is discovering the ways it defies expectations. In broad outline it is about a street singer who has put his emotional life on cold storage because of a broken heart and the woman he meets who helps him open himself back up to life. During the day in Dublin he sings familiar standards for tips but at night, when the crowds thin out, he sings his own original material. We see him this way for the first time through the eyes of the Girl as she first meets him (in the credits the two lead characters, never addressed by name, are listed as Guy and Girl). He, played by Frames' frontman Glen Hansard, is singing an absolutely stunning song with intense passion. As he finishes, the camera pulls back to reveal her standing there. From thenceforward we see the two of them get to know each other as they perform a string of amazing songs together.

Neither Glen Hansard nor Markta Irglov is a professional actor. Hansard did have a prominent role in another great Dublin film about music, THE COMMITMENTS. In that one Hansard played the band's guitarist Outspan Foster, one of the two original members of the band (he is the one who resists the suggestion of the other original member to call their band A Flock of Budgies). In real life, of course, Hansard has long been the resident genius of the great Irish rock band The Frames and both one of the great singers in rock as well as an absolutely brilliant songwriter (neither of which anyone who sees this movie will be inclined to doubt). While visiting Prague a couple of years back he met a precocious teenager who was none other than Markta Irglov. One thing led to another and within a year of their meeting they recorded and album together entitled THE SWELL SEASON. Next they appeared in this film by John Carney, himself a former member of The Frames. So their time together has been amazingly productive (she also appeared on the critically acclaimed new album by the Frames, THE COST).

The film is filled with wonderful little moments, like the first meeting (driven by Hansard's magnificent performance of ""Say It To Me Now""). Or the way the sound engineer recording the Guy's song goes from disinterest to interest as he realizes just how good he is. Or the marvelous extended shot that follows the Girl from a convenience store where she has bought batteries for a CD player down the street for a few blocks as she sings the lyrics she has written for a song the Guy has written the music for.

This truly is a very special film. It does not have the greatest production values; indeed, it feels like the low budget that it is. It works because the two leads, while not professional actors, have a wonderful chemistry both romantically and musically and because Glen Hansard is one of the finest songwriters around. In fact, the soundtrack for the film has to go down as one of the greatest soundtracks ever released. I would urge anyone who loves the music in this film to investigate not merely the soundtrack for the film, but both THE SWELL SEASON, the album by Glen Hansard and Markta Irglov, and two albums by the Frames, FITZCARRALDO and THE COST.",1192752000,5,3747,4.563150074294205
2997705,5,B000X1Z0BU,"During this time of the year, most movie studios release those surefire moneymakers known as ""the summer blockbuster."" With movies like ""Pirates of the Caribbean 3,"" ""Spider-Man 3,"" ""Shrek the Third,"" ""Transformers,"" ""Fantastic Four 2,"" ""Ocean's Thirteen,"" and ""Live Free or Die Hard,"" it's hard to not be enticed into the studio's lure. But while these seasons come and go, and their neverending advertisements riddle our media, it's easy for most cinematic gems - ones more original and genuine - to fall out of our sights and sadly not be noticed until DVD release, if at all. One such gem is Fox Searchlight's release ""Once,"" starring Glen Hansard (only noticed as the red-headed guitarist Outspan Foster from Alan Parker's 1991 hit,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Commitments-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00018D3XW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Commitments (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>) and the beautiful, wistful Czech musician Marketa Irglova (whose voice somewhat resembles Tori Amos ... only Irglova's music is good).

Hansard is also known as guitarist and leading man of the music group The Frames (with which director John Carney was bassist), and while he and Irglova have previously teamed up to record ""The Swell Season"" album as well as open for Damien Rice (whom Hansard's music sometimes resembles) on his first tour, their meeting in ""Once"" is so earnest and real that you'd think it was the first time these people had met. I heard most of the movie was shot with a long range lens, thus shooting the actors from afar and giving the movie more of a documentary feel than a fictional film, which works immensely. ""Once"" has such a basic boy-meets-girl storyline but with much more meaning. And it's that simplicity that helps make the overall message of this film so beautiful. The main characters don't even trivialize with stating names; all that matters is the connection these two have - much like that of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Before-Sunrise/dp/B00002E224/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Before Sunrise</a>. However, unlike ""Sunrise,"" there is no pretension with these characters, who do more than have romantic feelings toward each other and avoid their rehashings of their pasts. Despite the fact that they're virtually strangers, Hansard and Irglova have faith in each other; something that's sorely lacking in today's society. The two have a wonderful chemistry and I heard that they are/were dating in real life.

Set in Dublin, Ireland, ""Once"" is the tale of a guy (Hansard) who's a vacuum repairman at his father's shop by day and a guitarist/busker by afternoons and evenings, trying his best to support his widowed father and get over a break-up with his girlfriend. One night, while performing one of his outstanding, passionate songs (""Say It To Me Now""), he's tipped by and meets a Czech girl (Irglova), who's amazed by his song and becomes somewhat of a fan. The next day, when bringing the guy her vacuum to repair, we learn that the girl is somewhat of a musician herself - she was trained by her father to be a damn good pianist. Shortly after, the two stop by a music shop where the girl plays piano for him and he soon is taking out one of his original songs for them to both sing. What follows is a simplistic-yet-magical scene set to a beautifully haunting song, ""Falling Slowly,"" where these characters bond. Without mincing words, this song is absolutely beautiful and brilliant! And it's a good precursor of what to expect from this film.

With many critics describing this movie as a musical, or as director Carney described it: a ""video album,"" it's easy to agree because the film's music is featured so prominently and is played to help form and mold the characters. At times, ""Once"" feels a bit like an epic music video, but with much more feeling and story. Each time a song comes on, you feel more drawn to these characters, their lives and the connection they have. If you don't like the music, then there's something seriously wrong with your taste and you should probably start reevaluating what you consider to be good, real music.

I won't disclose any more of the film or the several scenes I loved as I'm afraid that may take away from the visceral, feelgood emotions they invoke. All I will say is that ""Once"" is one of the best, innovative films I've seen in a long time. It's emotionally honest, the music is better than anything you'll hear on mainstream contemporary radio, and it'll leave you feeling both inspired and rejuvenated. This is not merely a film to see; it's a film to experience! There're so many emotions and memories that surface after viewing this film and that's the sign of a great movie! I have to admit that while I'll be among the masses going to see ""Live Free of Die Hard,"" the chance of me buying that movie on DVD is a lot more slim compared to my excitement in buying ""Once"" on DVD for multiple viewings! Between Hansard's humility and Irglova's charm, it's easy to fall in love with ""Once"" more than its title invokes.

Sadly, because it's an independent film, you may have problems locating a theater where it's playing - which is a shame because, really, how many showings do we need of ""Pirates of the Caribbean 3"" or ""Ocean's Thirteen""? But if you do notice ""Once"" on Netflix or at your local movie rental store, make it a top priority to see this film! Drop everything and just see it. Afterward, I'll even bet that you'll then soon be visiting a music store and buying the outstanding soundtrack or the duo's great preceding album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Swell-Season/dp/B000GH3CVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Swell Season</a>.",1192579200,17,5822,5.18278427205101
2997706,4,B000X1Z0BU,"This couldn't have been better if Sean O Faoilean had written the story and Christy Moore had written the songs and directed the film. This is a charming story about two musicians who fall into an unconsummated love, but whose passion for each other is remarkable. And you can take the kids to it as everyone keeps their knickers on and apart from the occasional FECK! there's nothing to corrupt the minds of the tinkers.
The first 5 to 10 minutes of this film are so perfectly Dublin that it ought to be required viewing for anyone with an Irish avocation. And I'll leave it at that. The visual comedy of The Guy's guitar is just such a perfectly deft Dub stroke that it keeps all the sentimentality at bay. These are two souls who are joined by the passion of the music they create, and another of the perfect tones of the film is just how tellingly the story captures the songwriting and recording process. Having completed a couple of discs, I can tell you that they got it right, to the very last detail.
The tunes fit the story and while they may not be the greatest songs ever written, they have an emotional honesty that will remind you of Christy Moore or MIke Scott, and in that regard they are brilliant. In the end, the love goes unconsummated but not unrequited, and you'll just have to go see the film. I'll certainly pick it up on DVD as it reminds me of someone from a long time ago, and as I left the theatre, I could tell there were hosts of others with similar thoughts.

2997712,5,B000X1Z0BU,"""Once"" is an engaging and phenomenally sweet movie about young artists trying to find an outlet for their boundless need for expression. ""The Guy"" is a ragged Irish street singer with a beat-up guitar who reserves his own most pained and poignant works for the evening, when no one listens anyway. We encounter ""The Girl,"" a Czech street peddler of magazines and flowers, who also has a talent for music and who is attracted by the depth of the Guy's music. Given less talented writers, ""Once"" could quickly have devolved into romantic nonsense. But both the Guy and the Girl have unresolved romantic commitments that prevent them from easily falling into a tryst. Watching them grapple with their love and appreciation for each other while honoring their previous attachments is one of the joys of this movie.

""Once"" is basically a vehicle for publicizing the music of Glen Hansard and Markta Irglov -- the leads who actually wrote most of the music in the film. One suspects that the film is a lightly veiled version of their own stories. But, the locales and characters portrayed in the film are varied and interesting. From heroin addicts, to unemployed immigrants, to street musicians and poets singing for their dinner, the film is full of characters that are real and wonderful. The music is also quite charming -- especially if you are drawn to the kind of moody, introspective folk genre that is half crazed with regret, passion and mourning over lost relationships.

""Once"" is a wonderful tale of two people from different backgrounds who come together, for a moment, over a love of music. It is about getting unstuck from self-imposed limits. It is about taking chances and risking failure. It is about finding lost love and starting again. It is about life itself. ""Once"" is a fabulous and moving look at two people who once upon a gritty time risked all to make something beautiful.",1187222400,6,1896,4.848765432098766

It is touching and very real from the poverty of the main characters to the graininess of the film and the roughness of the music.

2997718,5,B000X1Z0BU,"'Once' is a movie miracle.  Drawing on the lives of two poor pedestrian people in Dublin, the film is a passionate and whimsical look at making music.  With genuinely good performances, a warm and witty script, and music that comes at you like a flowing stream, 'Once' is winning on every level.

'Once,' as in ""Once upon a time,"" he (Glen Hansard)(generically named a guy) meets a gal (Marketa Irglova) (similarly named) on the street.  He is a musician, belting out his own songs at an outdoor mall using a guitar with a gaping hole to accompany him.  At the beginning we find him chasing down a robber who's stolen his guitar case with all his change.  Such is his meager existence.  He hasn't quit his day job, either.  He works at a small, dirty vacuum repair shop when he's not making music.  She stops by him one day and is impressed.  (She throws in a dime, something he has the contumely to acknowledge a few times, yet he doesn't have the money to buy her magazine, either.)  She asks him pointed questions that put him on the spot, but her look and smile are so lovely that he's able to overcome the awkwardness, especially since she at first suits him as being someone she can leave her vacuum with where he performs.  (It's just quirky designs like this that make the movie so effective.)  He gets too forward at one point later, but he softens her interest to find that she, too, lives in a dingy apartment with her daughter, Ivana, who is just a toddler and her mother.  She is from the Czech Republic.  He falls in love, but both find the right notes musically.  She plays the piano and the keyboards, and her voice makes them a perfect match.  Remarkably, the powerfully felt music translates so well, and the purposely amateurish video clips of her show the streamlined fantasy she has become.  So focused is the series of home movies that (thankfully) stick out from MTV videos and makes the latter seem overwrought.  The music, the videos, and the movie sort of melt together into one story and song.  His passion inspires the music, but in every way she brings out the best in him.  Her passion also is in the music, but her inspiration is in many ways the same and different from his.

'Once' is truly a departure from other film fare.  At this point, I'll venture to wager it is one the best films of 2007.  After this experience, a good movie like 'Music and Lyrics' seems like a hollow confection in comparison.  (The vast majority of the songs' lyrics are credited to Glen Hansard with one by Maketa Irglova, and a few by familiar artists like Van Morrison--a perfect supplemental choice.)",1183680000,12,2615,4.536324786324786

I have very little extra money, but will probably see it at least a couple more times before the summer ends.

2997721,4,B000X1Z0BU,"I doubt if I've seen a film more unabashedly romantic in the past five years, and this small-scale 2007 film is a musical to boot. Even with its Dublin-set working-class veneer, the story is basic boy-meets-girl formula, but director/screenwriter John Carney's real-world treatment manages to transcend the conventions, even if only fleetingly, through the aching pop ballads which make up most of the soundtrack and the sincerity of the two leads. The plot focuses on an Irish street musician who plays Van Morrison hits for change during the day but reverts to his original compositions at night. Written for a long-established girlfriend who has moved away to London, his open yearning and musicianship attract the persistent attention of a young Czech girl. Despite his initial hesitation, they bond quickly over his music. There is a lovely scene in a piano shop where he sings and plays his well-worn guitar to one of his songs, a stunning heartbreaker called ""Falling Slowly"", while she tentatively accompanies him on the piano. The story simply goes from one number to the next while uncovering facts about the characters that guide their fate.

It's been sixteen years since his memorable turn as guitarist Outspan Foster in Alan Parker's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Commitments/dp/B00018D3XW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Commitments</a>, but Glen Hansard, lead singer of the Irish rock group, the Frames, plays the forlorn busker with a searching intensity befitting a man not only broken-hearted from a fading long-distance relationship but also worried he will end up repairing vacuum cleaners just like his stoic father. Markta Irglov has the quirky, endearing quality necessary to play the girl. But as musicians whose compositions supply the soundtrack, their acting is secondary to the music they play. Hansard's deeply felt music immediately brings to mind Damien Rice's and David Gray's melancholy folk-rock ballads, while Irglov provides a nice complement with a voice similar to Bjrk's plaintive style. I have to admit the low-budget production values (it was made for just $150K) does make itself clear with some shaky, hand-held shots and overly grainy film stock. But all in all, if you are a fan of any of the musicians mentioned and remain undemanding in regard to cinematic storylines, chances are pretty good that you will enjoy this little film enormously.",1182643200,15,2437,5.498666666666667

As someone who has been going through a lot of stress lately and not really listening to music, it reminded me to bring the music back. If the songs were not good, there is no way that I would have made it through the film.

A man and a woman meet while he is playing guitar and singing in the street for money. She wants to hear more. He is a little jaded from his last relationship, but he can't help but like her. Later on, he finds out that she plays piano and they come together in the piano store to play a song together. That was my favorite song in the movie. I found myself glued to the screen, and then, my mind wandering, because it reminded me that I need to discover some new music.

Things don't always end in life they way they do in Hollywood movies (and I'm glad for that) but you still can't help dropping a few tears. So touching and beautiful. I will definitely buy the soundtrack.",1182556800,78,999,4.091836734693878

3230999,5,B000X1Z0BU,"This is one of those rare movies that defies any neat classification.  It isn't a traditional love story by any stretch.  Though it is filled with music from beginning to end it isn't really a musical.  In the traditional musical characters will suddenly burst into song but it represented an interruption in the otherwise semi-realistic tone of the movie--think of Gene Kelly in SINGIN' IN THE RAIN.  But all the songs in this film are in line with the overall realism of the film, they are all songs that occur in normal life.

I don't want to reveal much in the way of details about the movie since much of the joy of the film is discovering the ways it defies expectations.  In broad outline it is about a street singer who has put his emotional life on cold storage because of a broken heart and the woman he meets who helps him open himself back up to life.  During the day in Dublin he sings familiar standards for tips but at night, when the crowds thin out, he sings his own original material.  We see him this way for the first time through the eyes of the Girl as she first meets him (in the credits the two lead characters, never addressed by name, are listed as Guy and Girl).  He, played by Frames' frontman Glen Hansard, is singing an absolutely stunning song with intense passion.  As he finishes, the camera pulls back to reveal her standing there.  From thenceforward we see the two of them get to know each other as they perform a string of amazing songs together.

Neither Glen Hansard nor Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute; is a professional actor.  Hansard did have a prominent role in another great Dublin film about music, THE COMMITMENTS.  In that one Hansard played the band's guitarist Outspan Foster, one of the two original members of the band (he is the one who resists the suggestion of the other original member to call their band A Flock of Budgies).  In real life, of course, Hansard has long been the resident genius of the great Irish rock band The Frames and both one of the great singers in rock as well as an absolutely brilliant songwriter (neither of which anyone who sees this movie will be inclined to doubt).  While visiting Prague a couple of years back he met a precocious teenager who was none other than Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute;. One thing led to another and within a year of their meeting they recorded and album together entitled THE SWELL SEASON.  Next they appeared in this film by John Carney, himself a former member of The Frames.  So their time together has been amazingly productive (she also appeared on the critically acclaimed new album by the Frames, THE COST).

The film is filled with wonderful little moments, like the first meeting (driven by Hansard's magnificent performance of ""Say It To Me Now"").  Or the way the sound engineer recording the Guy's song goes from disinterest to interest as he realizes just how good he is.  Or the marvelous extended shot that follows the Girl from a convenience store where she has bought batteries for a CD player down the street for a few blocks as she sings the lyrics she has written for a song the Guy has written the music for.

This truly is a very special film.  It does not have the greatest production values; indeed, it feels like the low budget that it is.  It works because the two leads, while not professional actors, have a wonderful chemistry both romantically and musically and because Glen Hansard is one of the finest songwriters around.  In fact, the soundtrack for the film has to go down as one of the greatest soundtracks ever released.  I would urge anyone who loves the music in this film to investigate not merely the soundtrack for the film, but both THE SWELL SEASON, the album by Glen Hansard and Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute;, and two albums by the Frames, FITZCARRALDO and THE COST.

Update 8/8/07

I just read today on IMDB.com that Twentieth Century Fox, which owns the distribution rights to the movie, has been so pleased with its performance so far - nearly $7 million in box office on only 140 screens - that they are going to release it to a much larger number of screens and give it a publicity push.  Obviously this means that this gem will be granted a much larger audience.  Hopefully it will garner the kind of acclaim it deserves.",1181347200,241,4278,4.612945838837517

The plot is about as simple as plot can get. An aspiring street musician whose girlfriend left him for London lives above his father's vacuum cleaner repair shop. A younger girl who has moved to Dublin from the Czech Republic after her husband left her hears him play and becomes his motivating inspiration. Their tender friendship is mediated by their mutual love for music, and many people have referred to this film as a musical, what with a dozen or so songs that move the story along. Best of all is a surprise and decidedly ambiguous ending. Actors Glen Hansard of the Dublin-based group The Frames and the Czech singer-songwriter Marketa Irglova (age 17) sing their own songs in this feel-good flick.",1180828800,7,841,4.847222222222222
3231001,5,B000X1Z0BU,"""Once"" is a real find. The story of a street musician who meets a Czech migr on the streets of downtown Dublin, is a believable, well-made film about love, dreams and making things happen.

Guy (Glen Hansard, a real musician who also appeared in the film ""The Commitments""), a street busker who sings his heart out on the streets of Dublin, works in his dad's vacuum repair shop. One day, a young lady (Marketa Irglova), a Czech immigrant, begins to ask him questions about his music, his passions, the inspiration for his ballads. They form a friendship and she encourages him to follow his dream and put together a demo album. As the friendship grows, she helps him negotiate a recording studio and practice the songs. In the process, she invites him into her home, to meet her mother and young daughter. During the course of their relationship, they grow closer, but she is still married and can't let anything happen. They round up some other musicians and begin to work on the demo, to help him with his dream.

""Once"", written and directed by John Carney, is a very intimate look at the relationship between these two people. A lot of handheld camera work, close shots and grungy, real locations help to give the film an incredible cinema verite look and style. The camera work is handheld, but not overly shaky, creating shots with an intimate, close appearance, really thrusting us into the middle of the action.

The relationship between Guy and Girl (as they are listed in the credits) is really an interesting one that draws you into their lives. Initially, the guy is a bit put off by the girl, she is extremely chatty and forthcoming, asking him a lot of questions about his music, why he sings certain songs, the inspiration, etc. As a street musician, he is naturally a little weary about people getting too close, he simply wants them to enjoy a little of the music and drop a couple of coins or bills into his guitar case and leave. So, the young woman who stops to ask questions, in her accented English, is a minor annoyance, until he realizes she is genuinely interested.

As their relationship grows, he feels a fondness for her, and as a single man, he naturally flirts with her. But when she realizes this is going too far, she gives him a little look, a minor reprimand, and he realizes she is right. They are friends, sharing an experience. And she is married, even if her husband still lives in the Czech Republic and they are having problems.

As they become friends, they become involved in each other's lives. He meets her mother and daughter, sees where she lives, has dinner at their house. She meets his dad and becomes involved in his making of a demo album.

When the duo shows up at the recording studio, with their fellow street musicians, the sound engineer greets them, but secretly reveals his true feelings to someone on his cell phone. He has a feeling this group is another example of people with too much ambition and not enough talent; they don't even know the technical details of recording the music. But when they start playing, he recognizes they have talent, the songs are good, and the lead singer, our guy, is quite good, so he becomes engrossed in making the demo as good as possible. He becomes a part of their team, investing part of himself in the production of the demo.

Part of the beauty of ""Once"" is that nothing seems forced. They don't have sex, simply to make the story more dramatic. In fact, the course of their relationship seems all the more real because they simply remain friends, close friends invested in each other's lives and livelihood. There aren't any manufactured crises involving her mother and baby or his dad. They simply struggle with real life.

Also, the music is quite good throughout the film. Guy sings a song, a love ballad he wrote for his girlfriend who moved away to London, a few times, each time making it a little better. Finally, when they record it for the demo, it is as good as it could be, with the girl playing keyboard and singing backup and the addition of the other musicians they have recruited.

""Once"" is a film about the guy following his dream. He wants to make a demo and travel to London, to try to get a contract. But perhaps more importantly, he wants to reunite with his girlfriend. All he needs is a little push, a little support and guidance from a friend. He finds that friendship with the girl, his new friend who helps him realize he should go for his dream.",1180569600,109,4475,4.5767790262172285

I'm not a movie critic, but this one is good enough that I want to encourage other folks to see it.  It's hard to explain the reasoning without giving too much detail about the story, or building it up too much.  But here's what I can say :

During the movie, I recognized that I was waiting for some tragic event (my wife said as we left the theater that she kept waiting for one of them to die), because that's what would happen in a standard Hollywood movie.  How sad that we've grown accustomed to movies that must throw big tragic events at us to create emotional responses because the acting, storywriting, and character development cannot suffice to make us feel emotions on a small scale.

In ""Once"", the acting and the story (and the music) develop the characters well enough, and tell a story that is plausible enough, that an ordinary tragedy is sufficient to make the viewer feel genuine and complex emotion.  All without trying too hard or backing away from it.  That's brilliant.  Worth seeing more than once, which is why I want to own it.",1180224000,9,1270,4.5506607929515415

3231004,5,B000X1Z0BU,"I haven't seen ""Music & Lyrics,"" the movie in which Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore play a songwriting-romantic pair, but John Carney's ""Once"" probably can be described as a cross between ""Music & Lyrics"" and ""Brief Encounter."" This delicate little tale of the musical collaboration and almost-romance between a thirtysomething Dublin street busker (Glen Hansard) and a young Czech immigrant to Ireland (Marketa Irglova) leaves us breathless with its simplicity and beauty. There's a certain amount of stylization--this is the movies, after all--but not the kind we're used to from movie musicals. The beautiful, melancholy songs--nearly all of them by Hansard and/or Irglova--arise organically from the characters, because they are musicians, and the songs they write are how they express themselves. Hansard and Irglova both have lovely, impassioned singing voices, and as actors they have a natural, unforced charisma. (Irglova is a first-time actress, but viewers may remember Hansard as Outspan, guitarist for ""The Commitments."") Carney's hand-held cameras give the film a near-documentary feel that nevertheless doesn't skimp on either sentiment or humor. The film's very first scene, depicting Hansard's attempts while busking to keep an obnoxious drunk from stealing his tips, is laugh-out-loud funny while demonstrating the precariousness of Hansard's existence. ""Once"" is that rare musical that envelops us in music and beauty while bringing home the tough reality of the characters' lives.",1180137600,8,1498,5.691964285714286

But after a few times through it I'm obsessed with the pure ballad storytelling stripped down music.  I've watched the movie several times & will again & again which I can't say that about others.

Maybe it's because I'm an older person, but I found the poor filming to be distracting and most of the music to be repetitive and tiresome.  I think that Markta Irglov's music was beautiful, and I liked the performance of her with Glen Hansard and the band, but Hansard's solo numbers didn't appeal to me at all.

3231198,1,B000X1Z0BU,"The movie that was assigned to our class, Once, is appropriately titled for once is exactly how many times I will watch it in my lifetime.  The movie started off somewhat interesting as the main character gets robbed and chases the thief down, only to catch him and let him walk away as if nothing even happened.  This act summed up the rest of the movie. Due to the main character being a pusillaminous man, the remainder of the movie was incredibly slow.  As the movie played, I became so bored and disinterested with the characters and their need to play 20 minute songs that I began to wonder if Professor Small was mad at the class, and assigned this movie as a form of punishment.  I also thought about the fact that Amazon users rated this movie a 7.9; which to me is obvious that people were so upset that they wasted an hour and twenty seven minutes of their lives they refused to let this movie rob them of any more time and just not rate or review it.

As the songs played in the movie, I couldn't help but think that the main characters voice sounded similar to that of a wailing man attempting and poorly imitating the voice of a woman who had just gotten over strep throat and smoked a pack of cigarettes before singing.  This movie had me bored and thinking about all of the things wrong that Ive done through the years and balancing whether or not I deserved this punishment.  I am proud to conclude I did not deserve this punishment.  They should play this movie on loop at terrorist detention centers and watch the confessions flood in as prisoners beg for this movie to stop.  This film is simply a drama of two emotionally unavailable characters, who are naturally attracted to one another through their mutual interest in music, as they keep reminding themselves of their previous partners in musical form.  I cant believe this film was actually funded.  The majority of the movie seemed to be shot with a handheld video camera, not for artistic value but simply because the producers saved all of the funding to rent the crane used for the final shot.  Which was also the best shot of the movie, not because of the crane, but because the movie was over.  Thank god (or whatever higher power you believe in) that I don't have to watch this film ever again.  If I were to go on a date, and my date made me sit through this, I would never talk to them again, even if there was a spark between us.  It should be noted that my girlfriend willingly watched this movie with me, which should elevate her to sainthood.

In conclusion, I hated this movie and never want to see it, or anything about it ever again.  I cant believe I spent $3 bucks to rent it.  I wouldve rather donated that $3 to a homeless person so that they could get their next meal, but instead of doing a good deed, I had to stain my eyes with the abomination that is known as the movie called Once.",1444003200,,2883,4.367041198501872

While the musical was light-years better, it was built on the shoulders of a solid movie.  ""Once"" is not your typical American romance; this independent movie is slower paced but well written, sung, and acted.  I'd recommend it to any indie film or acoustic music fan.",1441843200,,442,4.628205128205129

The actors and actresses were no names to me and they were great! I could not give it a five star because I could not see the songs and story meshing together as say ""the sound of music"" and ""singing in the rain"" or others that it would have to stand up to and stand up to the test of time. The great musicals have to strike a strong chord within you and they have to make you feel like a child. This one is more modern and cant really give you that feel. In the last ten years though, it would make the top three for sure.",1436659200,,680,3.8642857142857143

3231337,5,B000X1Z0BU,I haven't been this moved by a film about music since Almost Famous. I didn't think another film could do that. What both of those films have in common is that the film makers or writers knew the inner life of music in ways that only one who had really been there could. They knew they walked on holy ground and they told the story with all of the heart and poignancy and stunning revelation that that witnessing leaves in the souls of those who traverse the beautiful territory.,1423267200,,479,4.393258426966292

I had the feeling Carney wrote and directed this movie first then took all the things that needed to be improved and created Begin Again. Just watch Begin Again instead.",1418860800,,499,4.413043478260869

I don't know where to begin. I love this movie. It is the sweetest, most beautiful, and emotional film I've seen in years.
I'm a professional musician, and it was so real to me, what Guy goes through, what he's feeling, how he copes by being creative, pouring out himself through his music. I had a lady friend with whom I had a similar relationship to that of Guy and Girl. She was also in the music business and we were in the same performing group. The movie brought back some nice  memories.

Anyway, I've watched the movie twice in five days and the second viewing was as wonderful as the first. I'm a 48 year old man, but I've always had emotional reactions to movies, in other words, I cry at lol.
I'm an old mush, a sap, a forever romantic. This movie really affected me emotionally in a good way. There are so many great moments, and the music is beautiful. I highly recommend ""Once"".",1410393600,,1038,4.253807106598985

3231460,5,B000X1Z0BU,"A subtle, smart, and sneaky musical. It's filmed in a realistic, almost documentary style. And the songs aren't big numbers like Dreamgirls, Chicago, or Les Mis. The music and lyrics grow out of the context of the relationship between the two main characters, as they introduce themselves slowly to each other. This film is both heart-breaking and affirming, and proves that love stories can have happy endings without everyone living happily ever after.",1409616000,,454,5.232876712328767

In my opinion, it is a minor miracle.  Subtle, sublime and heart-movingly wonderful.  How two people who come together seemingly at random grow quickly to love each other; but how each quietly 'knows' that s/he cannot (at least at that moment) be together....  I wonder what destiny and providence hold for these two simple but glorious folks.  May they both be happy.  And for the time or for the duration, bear their necessary heartaches well.  I've also grown to adore the music.  Which is greatly and, also, ever so sensitively raised to a new level in the stage version.  It took me a while to realize this too.

3231534,5,B000X1Z0BU,I've always been a fan of stories that follow a musician's dream of reaching an audience. This is also a love story of two friends who have only an outlet in musical expression. As they grow to admire one another and create truly haunting and exciting modern Irish folk music they run into a few obstacles which they overcome with grace and great generosity of spirit. FIlmed on two handy cams with a small independent budget this is a miraculously inventive and worthy piece of art you would be remiss to not see!,1403827200,,514,4.537634408602151

I get really bored watching movies over and over but this one always makes me cry at the exact location even though I know the ending.  It is so not Hollywood and that is what makes it wonderful.  The music is cerebral and contains the 2008 Academy Award winning song Falling Slowly.  In the movie it was a climax on a piano/guitar with the eb and flow of the interaction.  Didn't need any nudity because it was better than physical lovemaking.,1403136000,2,509,4.43010752688172

provides us with an extraordinary film experience. The first duet that the new friends play has haunted me for years but I was unable to understand the words.  This time I opened ""closed captions"" on my screen menu and the exquisite lyrics were there for me, not disrupting the bonding that rapidly develops between  the young people as they play.  Money is not readily available to me at this moment but I immediately ordered ""Once"" and hope to share it with a wide variety of family and friends.  This film remains a sleeper.

It is easy to see how the little indie picture managed to survive for several years, often buried in the dark, only to shoot forward to win the Oscar for best score.  I highly recommend it.

This is such a beautiful movie about creativity, longing, and love. The scene in the music shop where she starts playing the piano is a mini-movie in itself. Overall, well-deserving of all the praise the other reviewers have heaped upon it.",1401926400,,408,4.680555555555555

3231554,2,B000X1Z0BU,I bought this because the characters are Irish (who doesn't love a good Irish love story?!).  But the movie was pretty boring and repetitive.  The main female actress was a bit bland and there wasn't much chemistry between her and the male lead.  Too much music and not enough substance.,1401926400,,287,4.7

3231562,4,B000X1Z0BU,"I think this came first, but the play was way better. I really got irritated that there was none of the comedy that's been added into the play. I suspect this was a low budget film. The story differs just enough to really irk me at points such as not giving the supporting cast a greater story. I still enjoyed it, but not nearly as much as I enjoyed the play. Perhaps if they decide to do a sequel that will be fixed. If you're trying to decide between seeing the movie or the play first, I would suggest watch the movie first. You'll have a greater understanding of some of the things during the play and you'll be pleasantly surprised with the script improvements.",1401148800,,667,4.344

But after seeing the movie, I reflected on how it's refreshing to have a movie where two people are kindred spirits, but it doesn't lead to a one night stand or a short-lived infatuation. They help to heal each others hearts, make a great record, then life moves on. It's a beautiful movie, with FANTASTIC music.",1399593600,,413,4.447368421052632

3231594,5,B000X1Z0BU,"I received the DVD in brand new condition, which was great.  There area a lot of really great special features, including interviews with the cast and crew, which make worth owning.
The film itself easily makes my top ten.  Normally I don't like musicals, but the numbers are done in a way that is fully integrated into the film.  Usually I'm left wondering why characters in Disney films are suddenly breaking into song.
Where this film really succeed is in its story, which is very basic love story, but done in such an eloquent way I can't help loving it.  I think they also manage to avoid a lot of the love story clichs.  This film is about two people who bond through their music.
My one criticism is although all the characters are speaking English, it's hard to understand some of the thick accents sometimes.  I had to turn on the subtitles the first time I watched it.  But that didn't hinder my enjoyment of the film at all.
So, I highly recommend this film.  It's about people being in love, and I think everyone can relate to that.",1397260800,,1044,4.457894736842105

3231634,5,B000X1Z0BU,"Very rarely does a movie come along and tug and every emotion you have. This one does just that. Aside from the beautiful music and on screen chemistry in this simple indie film, the storyline is exceptional and the acting is superb. I believe it to be one of the greatest movies of our generation.",1391990400,,298,4.4363636363636365

3231637,4,B000X1Z0BU,The movie is wonderful but a little disjointed.  The music is amazing.  It is a great film for date night.  The Broadway Musical which won 8 Tony Awards tells this story more clearly with the same incredible music.,1391385600,,214,4.578947368421052

3231640,5,B000X1Z0BU,Great & very unique movie!! Inspiring and quite honest. I loved it! It is a film that is very different from modern romantic films as it displays authentic keenness between a man and a woman without the attachment of intimate pleasures. Well done!,1391126400,,247,4.767441860465116

I went to see the play on Broadway and fell completely in love with the music and the story.  I came home and ordered this movie and it didn't disappoint.  It was shot on a super low budget but captured the spirit of the story so well.  The actors are darling, the music is GREAT and the story is wonderful.  Highly recommend it to anyone who loves music, loves anything Irish and who loves a good love story.  This is not your typical Chick Flick - it's good for everyone.  It's only rated R because the ""F bomb"" is dropped a million times but who cares when it's in an Irish brogue!",1390953600,,744,4.125

Each time I fall more madly and madly in love with this movie.
Music is incredible, acting is sincere, and scenes are heart wrenching at times.
Seeing the broadway show in the next few weeks and have heard nothing but amazing things.
I can't wait.
I'm hoping no sequel arises from this since it is perfect in it's own right.
Wonderful movie.",1390348800,,406,4.652777777777778

3231656,1,B000X1Z0BU,"The amount of praise surrounding this film baffles me. I almost feel bad giving this rating myself but the truth is, the film is just a poor attempt of a musician trying to break into the limelight. With the intention of being a charming, offbeat, tear jerking romance, it translates to a cheesy and boring waste of time. Poor acting eliminates all connection between the characters, poor writing makes the songs almost hard to listen to, and poor production makes it even hard to watch. Seriously, if you have no budget to work with, at least make your film's plot fresh or interesting. The story has been done many times and this is simply one of the worst of them. The movie came highly recommended from my ex girlfriend. After watching it through, I didn't have the heart to tell her how much I disliked it. Maybe every positive review out there is the result of that same guilt...
The only way I would recommend Once to anyone is if I desperately wanted them to stop asking me for movie recommendations...or if I hated them as much as I do the film.",1390089600,,1054,4.494791666666667

3231660,5,B000X1Z0BU,Well done and almost surreal. You don't have to be a romantic either. The music alone is worthy of attention.,1389657600,,109,4.5
3231661,1,B000X1Z0BU,"My husband is still laughing at this choice for what movie we would watch.  The music was fun, but the story just ended, fairly uncertain of what happened.",1389657600,,155,4.535714285714286

Would recommend this movie to teens & adults. It's pretty cleancut and the music is so great, they've made a musical stageplay out of it, which I really enjoyed this fall. I have gifted this movie to 2 of my granchildren this Xmas, and I'm sure that they & their families will enjoy it.",1389052800,,493,4.358695652173913

3231671,5,B000X1Z0BU,"This is a great independent, musical film about hope. The sort of 'romance' is a secondary part of the film that adds to its likability.

3231684,1,B000X1Z0BU,"This is an extraordinarily boring movie, and quite amateurish in feel. I watched the entire movie waiting for it to get better, but it was completely blah throughout. I found the fact that neither of the main characters' name was revealed (they are billed in the credits as, ""Guy"" and ""Girl"") particularly irritating. That's 85 minute of my life I would like to have back.

I did like the song ""Falling Slowly"", but that's it.

I think it might work better as a play, but I haven't seen the on-stage version. I certainly cannot recommend the movie.",1386288000,,548,4.639175257731959

I enjoyed the relationship of the guitar player and the girl who he met while playing music on the streets. .She was so very sweet and a talented piano player. He was very passionate about playing his songs he wrote and wanted to make a CD of his music. He became very fond of her. It was because they were enjoying making this CD. They both had past loves and
wrote songs of the relationships that seemed lost. I found that with each of them writing out their feelings in the words of the songs they realized that maybe they should try these past relationships again. They chose to go their separate ways instead of trying a new relationship together.",1382400000,,679,4.44

But the two of them have their own personal musical passions, and when those are combined, the result is more beautiful yet.  Like watching two desperate ships passing in the night, the viewer hopes these two will find safe harbor together.

The ""actors"" are the real musicians and they deliver a real, emotional performance. I saw the Broadway play after the film and I enjoyed it - the film still holds first place for me but it was nice to see it come to life on stage.

They make great music together. Boy still misses London girlfriend. I enjoyed the music so much I bought the sound track. Only when I shared a viewing with a friend did I note the abundance of the F bomb. Beyond that disappointment, I, very much, enjoyed the story. Although the lead characters were musicians first and actors second, I saw no deficiency. The lead actor/musician wrote many of the compositions. Happy times mixed with tears. In spite of my faulting it for the language, I DID enjoy this movie - to the point of purchasing it. To help with your overall experience, be sure to watch the bonus features. Maybe, like me, you'll also buy the music. Grab a glass of wine, some cheese and crackers and sit down and watch this one.",1370217600,3,907,4.604938271604938

3231755,5,B000X1Z0BU,"This movie was very entertaining as a slow paced mayhappenstance love story with an alternative ending you don't see in more movies. It is a melancholy presentation leading your heart to want them to succeed...

The movie has music integrated into it but is far from any musical I have ever seen. It may be a bit slow for some people who have short attention spans and lack the ability to stay with the plot line. If you are uncultured in the way of foreign mild Irish accents you may have a hard time understanding the dialogue in parts. It is a cute Sunday movie I would suggest you watch with your romantic partner.",1367798400,,618,4.421052631578948

3231759,5,B000X1Z0BU,"I was so surprised and pleased to see that this finally came out on Blu-ray! I have to confess, though, that I was skeptical about whether or not it would actually turn out to be ""Region-Free"" (see my review of the theoretically all-region BD of ""Clone"")... especially since the ""Product Details"" section of Amazon's ad states that it is ""Region B/2"".

For myself, it wouldn't matter, since (thanks to the ""Clone"" fiasco) I now have an all-region-modified Oppo BDP-103 player (best BD player on the planet, by the way)... but for the sake of others who need this disc to truly be an all-region one, I'm happy to announce that it is. Incidentally... sharp-eyed consumers will notice that rather than displaying the ""A-B-C"" region-code symbol on the back of the case, there is no region-code symbol at all. Just to make sure... I switched my Oppo to each of the three individual Blu-ray regions, and this disc played perfectly on each one.

The only caveat I have about the disc is that on the back of the disc's case, it states that the feature's audio output is Dolby Digital 5.1 / DTS Surround / DTS-HD Master Audio... which was an unexpected but very pleasant surprise.

Not true.

The original Standard-Def DVD release of this film was done in 2.1 Dolby Surround... and, not surprisingly, so is this Blu-ray.

Nonetheless... this remains as one of my all-time favorite films, and to have it in beautiful high-definition is absolutely wonderful.

I checked the DVD out of the local library only to find a damaged spot that completely disrupted the continuity of the story. I was glad to see it uninterrupted.

We expected to see some sort of magical encounter and perhaps the music was that, but the relationship was not. Happy endings for each of them but not together.",1361404800,,448,4.333333333333333

The director attests they were going for simplicity in the movie and it shows throughout. Other than Hansard's constant moping about his ex, the only real emotion displayed in this film is in the songs. But they are too born in angst and sadness to be inspiring. I wish we could have seen more character development with these two. I never got the impression Marketa was in love enough with her absent husband to welcome him back. Despite Hansard's alluded success, they both seem so alone at the end of it. Sad.",1361145600,,646,4.675438596491228

The acting is wonderful, genuine - you forget that it's not a documentary. It doesn't have the Hollywood ending, which I also like. Has moments of real humor, drama (not melodrama, thank goodness) - sincerity. Wonderful film - if I had anything negative to say, and I really don't, it went on a bit long.

There were parts where I couldn't make out the dialogue due to the accents, so that didn't help.

This ONCE is a gem that demands so little of us audience because it does not seek for the bright light. Rather it tells a simple story of two people (whose names we never learn in the movie) who just are. The story does not preach, nor does it solicit our sympathy or any such emotion.

However, it still portrays, passion for life, struggle, awkward human emotions, survival, and accomplishment. Last, the end doesn't leave life in a pretty bow tied package. There are still struggles going on through the successes. This felt refreshing.

It also feels so honest from a musical perspective because they aren't ""real"" actors. They are ""real"" musicians. It makes the movie more authentic. (I always hate watching an actor pretend to play an instrument with bad technique. It becomes so distracting that I can't even hear the music.) The music written for the movie is nice too!

While of course not the same, they both loved the movie which rekindled so many warm (and funny) moments.  Is this a blockbuster, mega-million movie? No way and it would lose so much if it were.

3231836,5,B000X1Z0BU,"I learned of this film after hearing about the Broadway show of the same name, which garnered a lot of attention at this year's Tony awards. Reading the various reviews posted here on Amazon is like reliving the iPhone-vs.-Android battle: people seem to be fiercely loyal to the music from either this film or the Broadway cast.  Personally, I think they're both great. The film is romantic and simple. Two people are falling in love, and the music not only seasons the story; it advances it. The songs are deceptively simple but work under your skin, and the entire soundtrack is beautiful and heartfelt. The story is one we've perhaps heard before, but told well. The two stars of the film also wrote and perform the music. The male lead was involved with and gave his blessing to the Broadway show...if he is happy with it, that's good enough for me. I'll likely never get the opportunity to see this show on Broadway, but I'm thrilled to have seen the film, which I'll doubtless watch again and again.

By the way, what a cool feature with Amazon...when I purchased this DVD I got a free 'ticket' to watch the film immediately on Amazon Prime streaming!  I watched the film on my computer the same night I ordered the DVD, so when it came in the mail I already knew how much I loved it.",1349481600,,1290,4.504273504273504

When I love a book, I want everyone to read it; I love this movie and I want everyone to see it. It's a low budget indie film set in Dublin; the major characters were not even professional actors.  Yet it's so absorbing and the characters and situations seem so real. (I am not, by the way, an arty indie snob..I love movies, including big budget blockbuster movies.) It touched me as no other movie has in years. And the music! I also fell in love with the music, which now has a prominent place on my Ipod.

3231859,5,B000X1Z0BU,"This was my favorite film from 2007.  I just purchased this Blu ray version.  It is a European product that I will discuss later in the review.  While ""Once"" is not a traditional musical, about 60% of the film is made up of music.  What makes this movie so special is the way the music is developed.  The Guy and the Girl (that's how the characters are identified) meet in Dublin, Ireland.  The Guy is a native and the Girl is from the Czech Republic.  They are both struggling musicians and begin a friendship that produces some of the best original music from a movie in years (won an Oscar for best song).

Naturally they are attracted to each other but both carry relationship baggage of the recent past.  Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova are rookie actors in the lead roles but are real musicians that became real lovers off-screen.  The Guy and the Girl are obviously meant for each other yet remain committed to others so their relationship doesn't go much beyond great friendship.  But the final scene where the Girl is looking forlornly out her window lets you know she may have just lost more than a musical partner.

When I first saw this film, I was mesmerized by the development of the music.  It was so real it felt almost like a documentary.  Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova are perfect in their roles and show a different side of acting.  Both are terrific musicians and the music is some of the best I've heard in a film.  The songs are poignant and just gorgeous.  Three great scenes to watch for:  1. When the Guy and the Girl finish the standout ""Falling Slowly"" that the Guy had begun to write.  This is done in a music store.  2.  When the Girl, listening on headphones, sings the words she had written to the Guy's song while walking home from the store where she had purchased batteries for the CD player.  Done in one take!  3.  When the Girl struggles through a very sad song she had written and finally breaks down before she can finish.  Just great direction and great emotion from the actors.  There are many other great scenes in this simple but effective and heartbreakingly beautiful story completed on a miniscule budget.

I had purchased this upgrade to a DVD I owned based on improved video quality as well as an uncompressed audio track.  The Blu ray video is excellent and is definitely better than the original DVD.  The audio is not what was advertised by the seller's (not Amazon) website or even on the Blu ray jacket.  Here is the wording on the jacket label: ""Feature audio:  Dolby Digital 5.1/DTS Surround DTS-HD Master Audio.""  Here's what you get:  DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0.  There are 2 additional commentary channels both in DTS-HD MA 2.0.  While I admit I was disappointed and clearly this is a labeling error, I have to assume the filmmakers wanted it this way.  The sound is clear and strong, but is not the surround generally expected.  I suspect the idea was to keep the sound in its basic format as it was made at the time.",1341964800,,2977,4.51782363977486

I found this to be so offensive that it totally negated any positive effects of the music. As for the music, several of the songs are more shouted than sung, and the music is dissonant and harsh rather than melodic, sweet and lyrical. I read the reviews for this play before ordering it, and no one even mentioned the offensive language! I would like to send this back to Amazon for a full refund. I wish that Amazon had a better method for completing reviews.

Now five years later, I watched it again and got even more out of it. So much so, that I immediately purchased the soundtrack recording. (Not sure why I didn't the first time.)

Besides the great music by Glen Hansard and Markta Irglov, the evolving platonic love story between the two of them is incredibly refreshing in this day of meaningless sex. Here we have meaningful love, but in the end they both return to their former loves, even while knowing that something special has developed between the two of them.

What I didn't catch the first time is how the music in many places propels the plot forward. Even a line in the show given in Czech and never translated, gives a hint as to what's really going on.

This film is delightful, and the fact that the film is low budget adds to the innocent quality of whole thing: music, story and location. I mean, what's not to love about Dublin?",1333497600,,1009,4.443243243243243

Once is the cutest love story without even a kiss.

3231871,5,B000X1Z0BU,"Once (2006)
Drama, Music, Romance, 85 minutes
Directed by John Carney
Starring Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova

The opening scene in Once shows a guy (Hansard) busking. The song is unremarkable, but a few people like it and give him their change. Then, two minutes later, something incredible happens. We see the guy singing at night when the streets are virtually deserted. Although he's alone, he's pouring his heart out using his beaten up guitar and raspy voice.

I was hooked from that moment on.

When the guy looks up, there's a girl (Irglova) standing there listening. We never learn their names. It's as if the story is more important than the people in it. She gives him 10 cents and they begin talking. He works with his father in a vacuum cleaner repair shop and she has a vacuum cleaner in need of repair. When she brings it the following day, she treats it like a dog on a leash.

The two have lunch together and she takes him to a music shop where the owner allows her to play piano. When she plays a piece by Mendelssohn, the guy's jaw drops open in astonishment. She invites him to join her on his guitar and he teaches her how to play one of his songs. That's how they begin their friendship.

The setting is Dublin and life isn't easy. The guy and the girl don't have much money. But what does shine through is the Irish sense of community. They love life and the people seem genuine and real. That description also applies to Once.

The film was shot on a budget of around 100,000 using two Handycam camcorders, but you'll quickly forget that and focus on the story.

The guy has broken up with his girlfriend and she has moved to London. The girl married at a young age, but her husband is back in the Czech Republic and has left her. So there's the possibility of romance and I won't ruin what happens for anyone who hasn't seen the film. What's even more important is their shared love of music. The two have a real connection and she wants to help him reach a wider audience by negotiating the use of a local music studio for the weekend.

There are two wonderful reactions later in the film. One comes from Eamon, who is an audio technician at the studio; the other comes from the guy's dad when the guy plays him a CD.

The special features mention that over half the film is told through the use of song, but this is not a musical. The songs never make you step outside the story and they come across as totally natural. As well as music, there's plenty of dry humor, but the story is mainly about relationships and pursuing your dreams.

Once is one of the most heartwarming stories that I have ever seen. The song Falling Slowly won the Oscar for best song and Hansard and Irglova have toured under the name The Swell Season. It just goes to show that you don't need to spend millions in order to make a film that touches people, and this touched me more than most.

In a world which rewards artists with the right look and a manufactured sound, it's refreshing to see people with real passion succeed.

As for the audio quality, I was a little disappointed that the Blu-Ray did not feature an upgraded audio mix from the stereo mix on the DVD; this is quite likely that the original theatrical release was only a stereo mix, but it would have been nice for a little upgrade in audio quality.

Some previous reviews noted that the additional content did not play for them on this UK release - I had no problems playing the bonus material. It is likely that the bonus material is in the PAL format used in Europe as opposed to NTSC used in the states, and if so then it is probably and issue with not all Blu-Ray players and/or HDTVs being compatible with that format.

3231902,5,B000X1Z0BU,"I recently saw this movie and it goes up there with one of my all time favorites.  It takes a unique twist on the ""boy meets girl"" dynamic.  If you want to make it comparable to another script it is part Music and Lyrics and part Before Sunrise, but truly this movie stands on it's own.

What makes this movie outstanding outside of the phenomenal soundtrack (which are all ORIGINAL songs for this movie ...when was the LAST time you can say that about a contemporary movie??) is the beautiful portrayal of the touching relationship between the man and woman.  For a moment it borders on the clich romance but their relationship connects more on the creative level.  Watching these two develop music together is nothing short of magical.  It gave me chills to see how each other's talents just blossomed when they were working together.  The music is unbelievably good.  The lyrics are heartbreaking and the piano and guitar and the harmonizing voices are fantastic.  I was reminded of Joan Biaz, Bob Dylan and Simon and Garfunkel while listening ...again though the comparisons aren't quite right ...it's that different.

What I also love is the subtle realism of this movie.  It doesn't have the flashy lights or the BIG dramatics or the drop dead gorgeous actors who hair and make up is so perfect that they look good from any angle.  It was shot creatively but felt almost like a documentary.  It allows you to connect with the situations deeper than any movie.  For example, when the girl was walking the streets up late b/c she just had to finish getting her thoughts down for a song, I was instantly transported back to so many nights when I did that writing down thoughts for papers at college or when I had to figure out my thoughts for a personal conflict and was compelled to walk until I finished.  Everything about the situation felt genuine, from the way she emptied out every remote in the house to how she ran out to the corner store in those ridiculous slippers.  I understood her character on a level I normally don't when watching a movie.

I would be remiss not to mention the music again.  I had never heard of either of these artists before watching this movie.  However I didn't feel like it was an unabashed attempt at self promotion.  The story was just as exceptional as the music.
If you are looking for a good STORY, wonderful ACTING and excellent MUSIC this is the flick for you.  However, if you are into cheap thrills, flashy car chases, and huge overblown drama ...it probably won't do a thing for you.",1314662400,2,2534,4.599109131403118
3231903,4,B000X1Z0BU,"I absolutely loved this movie.  Right after it finished I ran into my basement and started working on my own songs with my guitar.  I just wish I could write songs like this guy and girl!  I checked out the credits because i didn't even know that the movie's stars are the actual songwriters and obviously performers.  I also noticed acting credits said ""the guy"" and ""the girl""- I didn't even realize that they had no names until the end credits.

The existing reviews give good movie summaries, so i'll just point out a few of my favorite scenes.  Well, to start with I'm obsessive about watching the beginning of a movie- if I miss the beginning I don't want to see it.  Because the beginning is usually the best part- well I loved how art and commerce collide at the beginning when the street singer is robbed of his few dollars while he's singing, by another street person and then chases the robber through the streets- funny stuff.  Then I loved how after the ""girl and guy"" meet, she brings her vacuum cleaner so he can fix it and she rolls it down the street like she's was walking a dog!  Hilarious.  Then the couple visit a music store and she gets on the piano and he teaches her a new song of his and I was just overcome by this scene.  I think that girls cry when they're young and that guys start crying when they get older- because I just started tearing up!  I don't even know these people but I was overwhelmed by the beauty of the music.  I thought at that moment-- that is what music is- its love, its sex, its beautiful.  Music is magic and this scene was magic.

I also liked how she lived with her mother and they didn't have a phone and their neighbors came by to watch tv because they were the only tenants in the building with a television.  Well i tell you, there isn't one phony moment in this whole film.  And you keep waiting for the big kiss or the sex scene like most Hollywood movies, but it never happens.  The girl and guy share a love or friendship through music that didn't need to consummate into romance.  Although you keep hoping it does!  Amazing movie!",1311552000,2,2094,4.32051282051282

It is the story of a simple friendship between a broken-hearted vacuum cleaner repairman / street musician and a young immigrant single mother who loves to play  piano and sings beautifully.  The actors wrote all the music for the film and this was the female leads first venture into acting.  The fact that it is set in Dublin Ireland first drew me to the film.

It's just that good a song...it really is.

Of course, there will also be future-cinephiles that discover John Carney's lovely music-film ONCE and find themselves awed by the discovery of so gorgeous a paean to romantic love tucked away in such an unassuming little Irish indie.

Indeed, ONCE is a film that most of us fell very quickly for, actually.

ONCE succeeds largely on the shoulders of its powerhouse songs...co-written and performed by its two stars, Glen Hansard and Markta Irglov. There is a story of course...two lonely souls fall in love while making beautiful music together...but make no mistake, ONCE is more concerned with connecting its relational dots with sweet melody, not pitch-perfect plotting.

In addition to the aforementioned ""Falling Slowly,"" other standout songs/scenes include the heart-pounding opening number ""Say It to Me Now,"" the soaring ""When Your Mind's Made Up,"" and the most heartbreaking break-up ballad ever, ""Lies.""

Pablo Picasso said, ""Art is the lie that makes us understand the truth.""  Believe it or not, there is a whole universe of artistic truth that is outside the walls of the shallow, predictable realm created by market studies and focus groups.  If you are ready to put your foot into deeper waters, you can't go wrong with ""Once.""

3231911,3,B000X1Z0BU,"With nearly 300 very enthusiastic reviews already on Amazon, normally I wouldn't bother adding just one more, but in this case I am.

I received the soundtrack for the movie and played it over and over again.  I listened to the melodies, the lyrics, and absolutely enjoyed it every time it was played. An easy five star rating for the music.  So, I then almost anxiously got a copy of the DVD and was ready to be carried away by a modern day ""musical"".

As the movie unfolded ....
it was obvious that the movie was a vehicle for the music and not the other way around.  Normally, this would be fine if a) the script was good, b) the acting was fair, or c) if the production was such that it created the charm of the music.  If you watch the Extra Features, the director proudly says that he started with a sixty page script and he didn't want to overcomplicate the project with the pressure of overinvestment.  I can certainly appreciate why someone might feel that way, but the overall story just missed.  First, the songs don't tell the story of the characters very well and in some cases they down right contradict what's presented in the movie.  This is what happens when a script is thrown together using some extremely talented musicians without any acting experience.  I certainly don't fault the main characters, but they simply didn't pull off their parts with many lines being choppy and unconvincing.  There was no real flow or continuity just pronouncements about what was coming next and the reaction of the actors to those pronouncements.  So, all in all, the soundtrack set a bar for the movie that was so high that it was not going to work unless they really attempted to mold the movie more closely to the lyrics of the songs.

I can see why this won awards at Sundance ...
if you never heard the music and just sat back and treated it like a very rough indy movie, you'd be carried away by the music missing that the acting was both forgivable and forgetable.  But unfortunately, the movie, the direction, the many occurences when a scene didn't work and when they should have reshot (assuming the director knew to reshoot ... maybe he didn't) just made the movie clumsy and awkward ... something like the main characters.  Perhaps there's some beauty in that, but it is clearly a case of lost potential with such a beautiful soundtrack primarily written by Glen Hansard.

In case you're interested in the story ...
it's a boy meets girl in Dublin, he plays music, she plays music, they play music together.  Reality and history ulitmately set in and the rest you can find out by watching the movie (or reading another review that has a spoiler in it).

So I highly recommend ...
buying the CD ... listening to it a million times ... borrow the video and watch it Once (no pun intended) ... and if you really think that it rivals Brief Encounters or has the charm of similar movies (non-musical) like Before Sunrise, maybe even purchase it.",1296518400,,2958,4.549056603773585

It was wonderful. So unlike most American movies, it was unique, unpredictable and heartwarming.

The two leads are well played, raw, honest and never seemed like 'acted' roles.
There is quite a bit of adult language though so it is not for the younger crowd. The actor's heavy accents can also get in the way of comprehension but for the most part are understandable.

Besides the music being great, the relationship between ""guy"" and ""girl"" (you never know their names) is terrific. They both hold their own ground and play on each other well. They are a great compliment to each other. ""Guy"" is rough, angry and struggling. ""Girl"" is softer, motherly, and friendly.

One of my favorite scenes is ""girl"" walking around town pulling her vacuum along like a pet, in the hopes that ""guy"" can fix it.

Despite the cover photo, this is not really a romantic love story. But the tension is there nonetheless.

3231949,4,B000X1Z0BU,"When Two Worlds Collide-Updated October 2013

Everybody, everybody who lives in cities, or who takes public transportation to the city has seen some straggly, snarling, struggling guy playing guitar, playing it well or poorly but playing it to rise above the din of city noises, and singing. Singing covers of some popular tunes, some tunes which will get we damn busy heads down travelers already late for something to listen up for a minute. Singing and strumming, well or poorly, but always with an open guitar case in for the ""thank you kindly"" donation that allows him to survive, to breathe, to write his lonely ballads, and to keep the wolves (read: landlord and other bill collectors) from his door. What you probably didn't know, unless of course you are among the seven people in the world who still listens to and supports folk music, roots music, street music or whatever you want to call it,  that those nameless guys (and gals) have stories to tell. Have the usual array of problems and dreams like the rest of us.

Problems like love, marriage, kids, lost ones, and dreams of making it off the streets and into the music studios and then... That back story, both the problems and the dream parts, are what drives this film under review, Once, about the connection, for a moment in time as it turned out, between a guy street musician in Dublin (that`s in Ireland for the heathens and an immigrant girl wannabe musician (immigrant in the days when, for a minute, Ireland stopped being a place to get bloody well out of going across the sea to Liverpool or across the pond to Amerikee and was a place to go to for dreams).

Under normal circumstance such a boy meets girl saga, would seemingly pose no problems for them getting together. There would almost have to be (and was) a natural attraction. But that is where the back story gets complicated, complicated just like for the rest of us. First off the guy was still pining away for his muse-girlfriend (Irish) who betrayed him with another lover and who was off in London. Secondly the girl, a Czech national, was married, married with a child, a little girl, (and with a mother in tow) whose estranged husband is back in the Czech Republic. What draws them together is the love of music. His rough-hewn plainsongs of sorrow and lost and her more delicate wistful attempts to make sense of a world through song (and piano) that is kind of passing her by.

But to the music, the all- consuming music that is really the star of this film since a great deal of its time is spent with the pair alternately flirting and creating something like a demo CD to shop around in order to get their big break, the one that will right their lives. That music, which by the way was written and sung by the actors who played the boy and girl (Glen Hansard and  Marketa Irglova), gets a lot of work-out here as he or she will burst into song at command. But in the end the two worlds, the world of the muse-driven (and career-driven as well) Irishman and a young immigrant woman looking for a father for her daughter as well as the music just couldn't mix, couldn't stand the huge effort to put those two worlds together. Couldn't stand the collision. As so they went their separate ways.  How is that for a back story of that straggly, snarling, struggling guy you see at that subway stop every workday morning.

Original Review

This is a quirky film. No question. It provides a very interesting twist in today's international multi-cultural society on the standard boy meets girl theme, and in Dublin no less. It also provides a quirky look at a subject that has always interested me, the trials and tribulations of trying to make ends meet while one is waiting to get one's big chance on the musical scene.

As for the boy (Glen Hansard) meets girl (Marketa Irglova)part the two, a strong but sensitive Irish lad trying to go from busker (street singer) to the limelight and a displaced Czech gal (with child and mother in tow) trying to make it on her own in up and coming modern day ""Irish Tiger"" (at least up until the last couple of years) Dublin. The glue that puts them together?  Well, she just happens to be something of a muse- and apparently classically- trained at that. This one and one half hour film centers on that musical collaboration, the possible budding romance between the two, the baggage and drag of their previous lives and something of a surprise at the end. All the while they are making beautiful music together, really just the music folks (for the most part, although some of his singing is a little over the edge for my tastes). What no over-the top, no gratuitous violence to save a fair damsel in distress, no ironic detachment under the stress of modern living?  No. I told you this was a quirky movie.",1258243200,,4790,4.56993006993007

3231951,5,B000X1Z0BU,"This movie comes as close as any I have seen to what it is like to make music with other musicians. The scene in the music store is a perfect example of those rare moments when two people sit down to play for the first time and ""magic"" happens. The scene toward the end of the film when the musicians leave the recording studio in the early morning hours captures the essence of recording music perfectly. Unlike some of the other reviewers I liked the fact that they relationship between the Guy and the Girl did not follow the typical Hollywood arc. Another refreshing departure from the standard movie musical was the relationship between the Guy and his father. The music is a matter of taste. I happened to like it and understand that street musicians cannot deal in subtleties; they have to grab the audience by the throat. This movie's other achievement it to reimagining the musical in a more realistic way, and on that level it is a triumph. The music is more organic and not artificially injected into the story. The fact that it was done on an incredibly low budget shows that the concept and story matter more than anything else in making a great film.

I was hooked on their interest in each other, which in turn, lead to love, but not fulfilled. And the music was so enriching, I had to buy the video and the album.

3231971,5,B000X1Z0BU,"It's been a while now since I saw ONCE, but there's been no lessening of impact. I marvel at it still and love it still. I've done the MP3 thing with the songs and have pimped the movie to my friends. Looking at the glowing reviews here, I don't really have much (or, really, anything) to contribute, other than my unreserved support for this fantastic movie. My apologies then for whatever redundancy may follow. Probably you've heard most or all of it before. Still, I'll hang a SPOILERS flag here.

Getting somewhat poetic now: Modest in ambition, woeful in budgeting, but lavish in the ways that count, in honesty and heart and sheer musicality, ONCE quite easily measures up to any glossy product put out by Hollywood. ONCE looks unglamorous and at times even amateurish, and seems more real becuase of it. Featuring the blue-collar city of Dublin as seen thru the eyes of its inhabitants, ONCE tells of a tiny increment of time spent together by an Irish busker who repairs vacuum cleaners as his grown-up job and an impoverished young Czech woman who can make a piano sing. Glen Hansard and Markta Irglov in these roles are so natural and pitch perfect that I was startled when I found out how little professional acting they've previously done. I wasn't startled at all, of course, to learn that these two are real life musicians, and very gifted.

Some background stuff, garnered mostly from a Glen Hansard interview I read in the Montreal Gazette (published 4.14.07): Director John Carney used to be the bassist for Hansard's real life band The Frames, before Carney moved on to cinema and directing. Originally Carney had only wanted to consult Hansard over Hansard's busking experiences and also to use his songs for ONCE. Actor Cillian Murphy had already signed on to play the lead role, but then he balked at singing the difficult shifts in Hansard's songs and also with working with Markta Irglov, who had never acted before. Murphy pulled out, and a gutted Carney was out one leading man. Days later, Hansard asked Carney to play bass at a gig he was performing with Markta Irglov (they'd just collaborated on an album), and it was during this time, when Carney was rocking out and seeing how well Glen and Markta were getting on, that Carney hit on the idea of having Hansard play the lead. Hansard, initially very reluctant, was eventually talked into it. The rest, as they say...

Just to underscore how shoestring ONCE's budget was, John Carney had to engage in guerilla filmmaking, declining to pay the permits for street filming. The opening scene was shot with hidden long lenses, so the people on the street had no clue that a film was being made. One fallout to this was that when the scene called for the guy to run off with Hansard's character's guitar case, one unwitting bystander, trying to help out, booted the ""thief"" in the nuggets. Heh. In a way, not having bigger budgeting helped to make this a better film. Much of the dialogue is improvised, and there's an intimacy and an organic feel to the story that probably would never have been tapped into if the film had been better financed or cast with a name actor.

But amateur shamateur. Glen Hansard and Markta Irglov develop amazing chemistry onscreen. It helps that they know each other in real and that the characters they play harbor real-life connotations, musicians playing musicians. In the credits, these characters are known only as ""the guy"" and ""the girl,"" but Hansard and Irglov breathe life into them and deftly convey the melancholy and the relentless tediousness of their lives. The film premise is this, simply: two sad people finding a connection, creating brilliant music and then parting ways. There's a romance, but it's unrequited and mostly unremarked upon. The girl is married, with a little girl. The guy, suffering from a broken heart, halfway hopes of someday doing big things with his music, but is stuck in a rut. The girl proves to be the motivating push. I think it would've played false if the ending had been different. As it is, what goes on between the two is understated and bittersweet and terribly romantic. There's something so wistful and sad about the girl's last lingering look out the window in that closing scene, as the camera then pans out to the street and the end credits roll.

The musical performances are what elevate this film into something truly special. There are tiny, significant moments etched out in this slice of life story, little vignettes full of glancing looks and endearingly awkward conversation and a sense that honest to gosh lives are actually being lived here. But there are at least four absolutely showstopping moments in ONCE, and these happen when Glen Hansard and Markta Irglov play their instruments and lift their voices to sing. The guy's savage evening rendition of ""Say It To Me Now"" out in the street. The riveting duet of ""Falling Slowly"" (my favorite) in the music shop. The girl's late night excursion to the convenience store and her stroll back home as she sings the lyrics she'd just composed to the guy's music (""If You Want Me""). The guy's makeshift band recording ""When Your Mind's Made Up"" in the studio and the sound engineer getting schooled by the band's performance. All amazing, flawless stuff.

DVD bonus features come in the way of what I think is a must-hear film commentary by Glen Hansard, Markta Irglov and Director John Carney; a separate commentary by the same three on six of the songs; ""making a modern day musical"" - the Making Of featurette (12.5 minutes long); ""more guy, more girl"" - a segment exploring the relationship between the two central characters (9.5 minutes long); a webisode ""broken hearted hoover fixer sucker guy"" (basically, this is just some rough sketches set to this song); and the option to download ""Falling Slowly"" from the motion picture soundtrack.

The key, of course, is that we so personally identify with these working class characters, who everyday struggle and doubt like we do and whose personal triumphs, like ours, are more often than not measured in modest achievements. This movie reaffirms that in the routine and greyness of our days are sometimes concealed shades of color. And that, if nothing else, there is always music. I love this movie.

But I wonder how ""the guy"" had got on in London?",1234828800,,6324,4.806066176470588

This movie is not, nor does it try to be, anything more than a slice of life set to music. The real magic of the movie comes from its simple, honest treatment of the everyday life of two musicians in Dublin and their meeting. Their relationship is both realistic and playful, and the fact that it never stoops to the cheesy or melodramatic keeps the movie down to earth where it belongs. We don't even ever learn the characters' names.

Those who do not like the music of this movie (mainly indie acoustic singer-songwriter-style) will not like this movie either. However, anyone who can appreciate beautiful and symbolic music should watch it just for the tunes. Both the lyrics and melody are simple and haunting, just like everything else in this movie.

3231984,4,B000X1Z0BU,"Once tells the story of an Irish guy (played by Glen Hansard) who's nursing a broken heart. He's a musician, and all his songs seem to be about a particular ex-girlfriend. He plays his guitar and sings in the street for change, also working in his father's vacuum cleaner repair shop to make money.

One day, our guy meets a girl (played by Marketa Irglova). The girl, a Czech immigrant, has a young daughter, and she works like crazy (flower seller, paper seller, etc.) to keep a roof over their heads and food on the table. Turns out, she's also a musician. She plays the piano and writes songs.

The two feel an immediate affinity for one another, and pretty soon, they are playing songs together. The girl has immense confidence in our guy, and she helps him get a small business loan so that he can record a professional demo in a Dublin studio. They get a small band together, haggle with a sound guy over studio space, and spend a wonderful weekend cutting the demo, which everyone pretty much agrees is brilliant.

Over the course of the film, we realize that the two are falling for each other, but the ending is not trite and syrupy. It's real.

What I loved about this movie - The film was shot in a little over two weeks and with a tiny budget. It feels like you are listening in on other people's lives. There is no posturing here, no ""acting."" Just understated conversations and amazing music. In a movie about musicians, it makes sense that most of the screen time is either spent playing music or talking about music. And the music, largely written and performed by Hansard and Irglova, is wonderful.

This is a not-to-be-missed film. One of the primary songs in the film, ""Falling Slowly,"" won the Oscar for original music last year. It's gorgeous and deserved the win.",1228694400,,1786,4.5514018691588785

3231986,4,B000X1Z0BU,"In our cynical age, it somehow seems especially creative, even courageous, to make a film that is not about corruption, ennui, ulterior motives, dysfunctional social structures, or tragic flaws.  Once is a film that is refreshing in its earnestness and in its respect for the things that add meaning and beauty to our lives.

I'm not a musician, but I once aspired to be one.  And if I have one pet peeve about film generally, it's how film often disrespects music.  It's often treated as a subordinate art, mixed in to add a little punch to the main event, the dramatic narrative.  So many films use music carelessly.

Not this film.  This is a film whose central focus is the way that music forges bonds between people; how music enables us to express our feelings, and not only to better understand but to care about others; and how music is sometimes the most beautiful thing available to grab hold of.

This film reminded me of a conversation I once had with a friend, in which we concluded that for almost every person's romantic moments, music is somehow involved. Maybe it's a song you've danced to together, or heard together during a special sharing moment.  Maybe it's simply music that you listened to privately to work through intense feelings.  All in all, I'd wager that few of us have ever fallen in love without music being a big part of the picture.

This film is essentially a musical - but it's not like any other musical I've seen.  It's not a film that asks you to shift back and forth between plausible dramatic action and wholly implausible musical production numbers.  Instead, in this film, the music is central to the action; the characters are making music together, and every piece of music performed in the film is in a context where you fully believe those characters might make music together in that way.  I can't think of another film where the music seemed to matter so much to the characters.

We are so conditioned in our culture to indulge our societal ADD at the expense of respecting music and its uplifting power.  Thus, when I first watched this film, I was initially feeling like, ""OK, enough of this song, time to cut to something else,"" - as if sitting through an entire piece of music was more than a film could ask of me.  But unless a film does this, it can never fully convey the sense of the joy of making music, and how it brings you closer to other people.  The film shows people experiencing this in all its fullness, a special, deeply human experience worth celebrating.

In a lesser film, the film's studio scene would involve some kind of subplot during the performance - furtive glances, repressed conflicts, other dramatic elements - it's all too easy to imagine.  Here the only focus of the scene is the shared satisfaction of making the music itself.  Similarly, a dinner party depicted in the film is significant chiefly for the music that people share during it.

The film is shot in a very natural, unobtrusive style; you often feel as though you are just a fly on the wall, whether it's in a repair shop or an apartment.

OK, a small confession: the music in this film isn't really my cup of tea.  It's more repetitive than I would like, especially so in the lyrics.  And I have an issue with music that is too persistently emotive.  I can deal with a song building to a pitch of emotionalism, but the songs in this film tried to sustain that high pitch more than is my personal taste.  But I say this not to criticize the film; it's simply to say that you can enjoy and respect this film even if this isn't your favorite musical genre. And, I must say, there is no denying that the protagonists do produce some harmonies that are genuinely, hauntingly lovely.  Favorite genre or no, there is some truly beautiful music here.

Another thing I appreciated about this film is that it felt no need to create contrived situations, black hats, or exaggerated conflicts.  The characters are real people, dealing with plausible issues - heartbreak, loneliness, parental responsibility, regret, money problems, frustrated hopes - which the film doesn't overplay.  It just shows men and women using music to work out the feelings that arise in their lives.  And, it should be said, the music enables the viewer to feel some of the emotion, too.  I saw some moist eyes at film's end.

I'm uncertain how much to recommend this film to my friends; it's certainly not Citizen Kane.  I am afraid that one of them would put it in the DVD player, decide the music was too plaintive, and start rolling their eyes.  For me, though, it all pulsed with sincerity, and I appreciated that feeling.

Music is one of the most precious enrichments of the human experience. This film respects that, and honors it.",1226793600,3,4751,4.619785458879619

3231993,2,B000X1Z0BU,"Now don't get me wrong, my two-star rating has nothing to do with the movie itself. Once was easily one of the best movies I saw last year, it is definitely one of the finest and most moving musicals I've ever seen, and has some of the finest music you will ever hear. My frustration lies in the U.S. DVD version of the film, specifically its audio.

I received Once as a Christmas present last year shortly after it came out on DVD. I went to watch it again and immediately realized the audio playback was wrong. It was half a step too slow, so all the songs were out of key and the voices sounded somewhat lower than when I first saw the film. I tried other DVD players and got the same result.

So I was disappointed, but I assumed that since the DVD had just been released this had just been an error in DVD authoring. Many DVDs have had to be recalled or reissued because of a glitch or mistake of some kind. So nine months later, the DVD is still circulating well and the movie is even being shown on HBO (and played perfectly in tune to boot), so I finally head back out and buy a fresh new copy of the DVD...and get the same result. The audio is still wrong, still flat, there are other DVD formats, a CD soundtrack and a TV broadcasting of the film offering sound evidence of an audio discrepancy, but nothing has been done about it.

This is why I'm so frustrated. I love Once, and I want to see it in its finest musical form. Too bad I live in the U.S. which just happens to get the short end of the stick in the audio playback department. My advice to any other U.S. viewers, watch the movie on HBO or watch the DVD on one of those players in which you can actually adjust the audio pitch on the disc playback by half steps. Or just hope that the DVD is some day rereleased and something is finally done about this. What a frustrating setback for an excellent film.",1220572800,8,1877,4.1652892561983474

The class is roughly three hours long, but when it came time to end, we still had fifteen minutes worth of film to watch. Our professor gave us the opportunity to stay, and fifteen of twenty-two people decided to watch the rest of the movie.

Once is that type of film.

The music is amazing and the plot is strong, with well-written dialogue and wit. The story revolves around a musician in Dublin, Ireland and his week-long experience with a mysterious young woman who quickly captures his heart. The two compose music together, and by the time it's all said and done, their friendship is as strong as their melody.

No one needed to be ""perfect"" or ""experienced,"" because you feel like you are watching a moment of two people's lives, very natural and real.  And the main song from the movie, ""Falling Slowly,"" won a well-deserved Academy Award--it's one of those gems of a song that comes along very, very rarely and changes your life.

I have shown it to audiences of 12-18 year old kids who sat riveted through the whole thing, (very mild) adult content and all, when three years ago they'd have been watching cartoons.  If you love gentle romance, music, Ireland or any combination of the three, I cannot recommend ONCE highly enough.  The one suggestion I would have, especially in showing it to others who don't hear a lot of Dublin accents, is to turn on the English subtitles.  It really helps to know exactly what they're saying when they get going fast or the crowd noise rises.

BUT MAKE SURE YOU CAN LISTEN TO THIS MUSIC

The first time the guy and girl sit down to do a song together, it seems pleasant enough.  It's a bit histrionic and repetitious, but there is one good section of lyrics.  But, at least for my wife and me, thereafter, the music was all but intolerable.  It struck us as tedious, with lyrics that are juvenile at best.  You hear much of the same song over and over and worse, every other song employs the same tortured singing.

Well, the moral of the story here is that if you like small movies with not entirely predictable plots points and utterly decent folk as characters, this is a wonderful, four-star movie

IF YOU CAN STAND THE MUSIC.

Neither my wife nor I could and we have widely divergent tastes in music.  Listen to the first song on the soundtrack at least three times.  If you still like the song after that -- and like small movies, you will likely join the significant list of critics who raved about this movie.

3232023,5,B000X1Z0BU,"When I originally purchased this film, I based my decision on looking at the customer reviews; that's how I purchase almost any film nowadays (or anything else, really).  However, I wasn't truly impressed with the movie, at least from previews, and thought it to be just another love story; it just happened to be well-written.

The opening sequence, for lack of a better way of putting it, opened my eyes.  I'd watched several musicals in past, and wasn't particularly interested in another, but Once came highly recommended, and the first song in the film proved why.  I was simply awestruck by how powerfully moving all of the music was of the entire movie, and immediately purchased the soundtrack as soon as I could find it.  I now have owned the movie and soundtrack for three months, and can't stop listening at least once a week.

Glen Hansard has one of the most haunting voices I've known, and after having heard it on the soundtrack, I went out and got all of the Frames albums I could find.  His range is one of the best I've ever heard, especially in Once.  Marketa Irglova is wonderful as a solo singer/songwriter, as well as a duet partner, and I've so far found at least three projects she's been involved in.  Both artists are incredible singers in their own right, but by including them both in this movie, someone has done something impossible: make a musical seem like it's a wonderfully felt story, not a production.  I would easily say it's on par with Rent and Across the Universe in it's musical talent, and with Reign Over Me in simply how poignant love, loss, and renewal can be.

The song that has the strongest meaning for me was ""When Your Mind's Made Up"", if only for the chorus, and how it conveyed the immediacy of demanding a decision on the part of the spurned lover.  This is, of course, followed by the fan favourite ""Falling Slowly"" because of how you could feel the love of the singers through the words ""Take this sinking boat and point it home / We've still got time"" in the chorus.

To close as best as possible, I easily recommend this film to anyone who wants a new movie to watch.  I'm a guy, and stereotypically I don't watch ""chick flicks"", but this movie is more than that; it's for anyone who loves music, and how that music can affect their lives.

It only took one time, but after having seen this film with someone I cared about, I'm convinced it's perfect as can be; it said everything I couldn't, simply because words alone can't do it.

This is the best movie for anyone who can't find the words for what they know to be true, and especially for anyone who loves music and film.  It deserves all the awards it gets.",1210377600,2,2669,4.492753623188406

3232026,4,B000X1Z0BU,"Once is another movie that my friends got me really excited to see. (Previously, I had been told that Reign Over Me was better than a ten point scale could ever express. Big disappointment).

First off, I hate musicals. I say this never having seen an entire one. That being said, this is not the type of musical that has actors spontaneously bursting into song. Rather, it almost seems like a documentary on a songwriter.

By this, I mean that Once really gives an excellent feel of Dublin and its locals. When they are singing, it isn't because they are in a movie that is a musical; instead, it is because they're all... well... musicians. Each time a song is played, it seems extremely realistic.

Therein lies an interesting part of the movie, though. Even though the singing seems very natural, it also serves to develop the story -- not by explaining plot, but by explaining the history and feelings behind characters. This can be tough, because you're almost obligated to try to decipher the songs. As soon as I started just enjoying the music without trying to comprehend lyrics, I thought -- shoot! -- I'm missing dialogue.

The initial meeting of the guy and the girl is awesome. The actors (or musicians) truly click, and the viewer sees what could be the start of any romance in any other Hollywood flick. The not-quite-romance is a joy to watch begin. But, it never seems to get past this initial point.

If one of the movie's taglines is in regards to how often you find your soulmate, then I really wish that point had been pushed harder. While they were cool to watch with each other, I never got the sense that the guy and the girl were meant for each other. For whatever reason, in my mind, I was comparing the couple to the couple in Good Will Hunting. In that movie, I really got the sense that Will would have fought for his girl. Not in Once. Maybe with some expanded run time, this could have happened.

Oh -- I thought of a better example. Johnny Cash & June Carter in Walk the Line. The initial meeting is just as cool as the one in Once, but the viewer really sees the relationship develop into something where both Johnny and June are willing to fight for one another. In Once, honestly, I just feel like the guy and girl are wondering ""what could have been,"" instead of pursuing being together. Maybe that was the point of the movie.

All considered, Once is definitely worth a watch. Rather than watch it again, though, I would be more likely to listen to Glen & Marketa's album (which is called The Swell Season).

There he meets up with a Czech immigrant (Markta Irglov) they strike up an easy friendship over their love of music and of course, a broken Hoover.

Over the next couple of days they share their music, write songs together, and then eventually record an album.  All the while they are building a friendship that borders but never crosses to romance because of his love for an ex and her rocky marriage.

The music was written and performed by the actors and the result is magical.  As I sit here typing this review, the songs are happily playing in my head; memorable melodies and haunting lyrics. The credits had barely started rolling when I hopped online to order the soundtrack.  He plays guitar and has a voice that is sexy and powerful.  She plays the piano and has a voice that is sweet and angelic.  Together they are superb.

There is something so sensual about really good music, the way every note and word can touch every inch of your soul and take over your heart.  I was literally moved to tears by a few of the songs in this film, not because they were sad, though some were, but because they were so beautiful, so perfect.

Every ONCE in a blue moon I will watch a film that will captivate me from the start and stay with me long after it's over.  This is one of those films.  It touched me on so many different levels and evoked so many different emotions and thoughts.  I will watch this movie, listen to its soundtrack, repeatedly, and never tire of it, because it's just that good.

The storyline is bittersweet and eloquent; a modern day musical about two people at a crossroads in their lives when they meet.  Each one gives the other one the shoulder and the shove they need to get on with and get what they want out of life.  A simple, but magnificent film with amazing music and actors; the result is unforgettable.  Brilliant.

3232043,5,B000X1Z0BU,"I did not have high hopes for this film. It is mercifully short (85 minutes), which almost merits a star by itself -- filmmakers today cannot just tell a story and be done with it. They think they must add layers and drag it on for over two hours.

The movie opens on a street corner somewhere in Ireland. A guy with a guitar is playing his modern folk tunes (what we'd now call ""indie music"") with his guitar case open for tips and contributions. After an altercation with a druggie who tries to steal his guitar case, cut to the nighttime, when he is wailing out a very personal song of woe, strumming loudly and emphatically. A young woman walks up and throws ten pence in his case, asking him if he wrote the song. An acquaintance is struck -- she is a Czehk immigrant who sells flowers on the street and does domestic cleaning. He's a vacuum cleaner repair man by day, working in his Dad's shop. But they both love to sing/play music, and dabble in writing it. Over the course of a couple of weeks, they work together to flesh out some songs he's written and record them, as the guy starts moving seriously toward trying to make it in the music biz.

This film is one of the most charming things I've seen in years. It is a small film, a simple story about simple people with dreams, struggling with heartache and poor circumstances, who create something together, and in the process learn a bit about themselves and find a sudden, new, and deep friendship and love. It is amazing how authentic and real it comes off, amazing because this was a tiny movie, probably shot on video instead of film, cheap to make, with unknown actors. Yet Hollywood cannot seem to make a film that takes the audience into a friendship with living, breathing, real characters that you can't help but have immense affection for by the time the final credits roll. I can't say it never happens, but usually I'm painfully aware of contrivances and manipulations, poorly disguised.

The central theme of the movie, the core around which everything revolves, is The Guy's songwriting and The Girl's collaboration with him in creating and performing it to make a demo recording. It is not really my kind of music. It is the music of simple feelings, performed by people who do not have perfect, trained voices. Forgive my Irish, but I'd call it ""sad b*stard music,"" because it's about heartache and longing and misunderstanding and reaching out for connection and love. The melodies are sometimes pretty, but it's main virtue is that it is sincere, if not often very poetic (by my standards). The great thing about it is that you can believe that these characters could write these songs, because they aren't that sophisticated. (Unlike the recent August Rush, where a child who has never played an instrument suddenly becomes a performing and composing prodigy. Talk about a leap.)

And that's what stands out about this movie. Sincerity. Hard to find in a modern motion picture. I may not watch this multiple times, but I found it very moving, in a positive way.

I was appreciative of the effort to develop and grow each participant for their own sakes.  Boy and Girl did not end up together, which would have been very cliche, but ended up where they wanted and perhaps needed to be.  What is wrong with that?
I loved the father/son interplay. Although a small part it was telling of the character of the boy and a big credit to the generosity of the father.

3232046,5,B000X1Z0BU,"This is definitely a very charming movie and gem not to be missed.  However, I would not encourage this for those looking for a ""musical"" or a sappy romantic film.  It follows the path of an young Irishman still feeling the pain of loss from the breakup with his girlfriend.  A young Czech immigrant encounters him playing guitar on the streets of Dublin, befriends him and they build a bond centered on music and their passion for it.  I won't give away any more details aside from that basic plotline.

Suffice to say, all aspects of this film fit together perfectly.  The film is shot in a very low budget fashion, capturing both the grittiness and revival of Dublin.  The acting is first rate, both lead and supporting cast and the music is both a perfect complement to the characters relationship and the overall tone and feel of the filmmaking.

Not to mention the music is awesome and Glen Hansard is such a fantastic musician, I immediately downloaded the soundtrack AND some of the music he did with The Frames.

They both share an interest in music and she is the catalyst that awakens him so that his life and music can begin to move forward.

This is a new type of romance film where the music is not only great, but is also the star and tells us the story. The music itself is a lead character in this movie. This newfound friendship is the motivating force in pushing his music career. I like that the movie also gives us a small glimpse into the creative process of the music.

It is hard to believe these two are not actors for they were so natural. It may be because they are musicians, so they were just acting naturally. This low budget film but the chemistry of the two main actors and music make it a must see film.

3232081,5,B000X1Z0BU,"""Once"" is such a lovely film... We finally sat down to watch it and, like so many others, were enchanted by the odd, intangible chemistry between the two lead actors, and by its fascinating glimpse into the creative process.

If you enjoyed the film's presentation of how music is made, and how creative people collaborate, there are a couple of other films that come to mind that capture some of the same vibe. One is a bit silly, teh other is more profound:

""Music And Lyrics,"" with Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore, is the silly one. I really liked even though it's so fluffy -- but the scenes where they collaborate on the songs are key to their characters and their relationship, much like similar scenes in ""Once.""

""Tribalistas"" - this DVD documentary of the making of the ""Tribalistas"" is utterly thrilling.  The film features Brazilian pop stars Marisa Monte, Carlinhos Brown and Arnaldo Antunes and shows them recording an album from start to finish. If you liked the creative scenes in ""Once,"" and wished there were more of that in the film, then track the Tribalistas video down -- it's one of the purest documents of musicmaking and creativity I've ever seen. Truly amazing.  Anyway, that's my two bits.  (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide to Brazilian Music)",1203638400,,1266,4.784403669724771

3232083,3,B000X1Z0BU,"Writer/director John Carney's charming little Irish musical ""Once"" gained steady critical favor since its quiet release into American theaters last year. Now with an Oscar nomination for Best Original Song (and win since this review was first written) its exposure has become more widespread, with its soundtrack selling consistently. Starring two musicians with scant previous acting experience - the Irish Glen Hansard and Czech Marketa Irglova - the film is acutely distinct in that its two principles write and perform the entire score themselves, telling the stories of their respective characters and how their lives intertwine.

Emphasis on the value of dreams and loose nature of love imbues the plot, with an understated pathos informing the nature of the characters. In fact, Hansard and Irglova's roles are simply that of Guy and Girl so as to keep things universal. The film has a well-defined charm and niche appeal, but it also wallows in overly sugary romanticism and trite, self-congratulatory art. At least to a degree. If movies could be desserts, ""Once"" would be a creme brulee with its hard, crunchy surface of pure sugar and silky custard underneath - although it leaves a good taste, the film clearly take itself too seriously. Presentation outdoes substance.

They may not be trained actors, but Hansard and Irglova are innately endearing with strong screen presence, amplifying Carney's story beyond its rightful realm. Because of this even their most whiney, pedestrian compositions benefit from their cinematic context. If this Guy or Girl were your friends in real life you'd probably encourage them and attend their coffeehouse gigs, yet you would also likely furrow your brow if they sold more than 100 copies of their latest demo. That is not to say that their music is of poor quality. It's not. But grabbing a guitar and howling at the moon about a love gone wrong turns stale pretty fast. Self-pity is not an art form in and of itself, regardless of the fickle taste of late 2000's record buyers. Only listeners with unrefined palettes will find anything offered here groundbreaking.

The romantic subtext of the film is well executed because of the characters' clear mutual respect and understanding of each others' different walks of life. Irglova may be half Hansard's age, but that does not compromise the film's integrity. The Guy may be a cliched out of work musician with a job in his father's vacuum repair shop, busking the streets of Dublin in hopes of making spare change, but the way he meets the Girl is engaging and believable. The journey the kindred spirits embark upon never fails to entertain in spite of the tunes, which are mildly enjoyable at their best. No back button required.

It is not the revolutionary musical masterpiece some have made it out to be, but ""Once"" is still worth a rental for those keen on romance or all things Irish. Ultimately it smacks more of cuteness than of high art, but what's wrong with that?",1203465600,3,2977,4.983903420523139

The film literally sings of love, confusion and hope.  Since watching the film I can't get E. M. Forster's words ""Only connect..."" out of my head.

After watching the film you will probably want to find more of the amazing music by The Frames and Glen Hansard - you know where to find it. There is an excellent interview/live set available online with Glen Hansard and The Frames which was done by the incomparable David Dye at WXPN's World Cafe Live in Philly last May.",1203206400,3,644,4.495726495726496
3232085,5,B000X1Z0BU,"If you are in the mood for a gentle, endearing movie, then ""Once"" is a gem. Realistic dialog, believable situations, acting that is entirely natural (likely to happen when the leads aren't actors but actual musicians!) in a story that isn't forced. If you want a Hollywood fairy tale, this is not for you. It is a modern musical in that songs are used in their entirety and to advance the story rather than just being relegated to the background soundtrack; the music and lyrics depict the emotions of the leads and are the heart and soul of their relationship.

Thank God for Sundance which lets independent films like this find the audience they deserve.

It says:

""PC users should find that the ROM content menu automatically launches when the disc is inserted into their DVD-ROM drive""

""MAC users may access the ROM content menu by double clicking the index.htm file or by dragging it to their favorite web browser window.""

Once the Mac user finds the index.htm file (in another directory) and opens it in their browser, then clicks the download song link, it does not work.

The story of two ordinary people who find each other and discover hidden talents in one another is beautifully acted and portrayed with an emotional honesty that is riveting.  It is a real world love story, with real world problems and the music, even more than the script, tells the story and stays with you long after the movie is over. The inside look at how talented people go about their art in the real world makes most Hollywood movies look phony, contrived.  Thankfully, the CD from the movie is lovely and helps rekindle the feelings of seeing it for the first time, but don't listen to the CD until you have seen the movie.  It will spoil the experience!",1202947200,2,738,4.444444444444445
3232091,2,B000X1Z0BU,"This movie is boooooooooooooring!  It doesn't at all know what it wants to be--a musical or a comedy--but it fails at both big time!

Because when I see a musical I want my feet to start a tappin' from scene 1, and that something that all the great musicals like Mary Poppins and other junk do.  Also a musical like West Side Story knows how to tell a story and create memorable, unforgettable tunes, weaved around the story that is so great.  I haven't seen West Side Story, but I understand the caliber of the film, trust me.  But as far as the musical numbers in Once go, all I can say is: WHINY MELODIES and PUTRID HARMONIES!  I know they say the musical is dead and there haven't been any good ones in about 40 years since Mary Poppins, but still they should try a lot harder.

As far as the comedy part goes, this movie is no Animal House.  What's great in Animal House is that it's a bunch of losers, but they're in a way treated like winners because we identify with them from the very outset of the film.  Who hasn't felt like an outcast and wanted to start a food fight, or put a horse in a classroom, or sabotage a parade?  I know I have.  And John Belushi, at the height of his fame, was outstanding as the fat guy in Animal House.  Also keep your eyes peeled for a cameo by Stephen Furst!  Sure some may call it college humor, but Animal House has it all for everybody!!

Basically the problem with Once is that it doesn't really offer anything, and it does not know what it is or what its voice is.  I did not enjoy it, mark my words.",1202860800,4,1548,4.147651006711409

we listenened, we watched.  I had read a small, rave review in the New York Times some months before and also
enjoy mvoies made in Ireland and England.  I try to support independent films as well.

My daughter and I talked and talked about the movie, purchased  the music (which she now plays on the piano) and the DVD as soon as it came
out.  I'm pleased to say we've introduced Once to dozens of people who love it equally.  I hope many more
will see it.",1202860800,,563,4.157407407407407
3232093,4,B000X1Z0BU,"Once tells an exceedingly simple story with enormous charm and heart and without a hint of guile. Glen Hansard is an Irish busker, still suffering from a broken heart over a previous girlfriend. Marketa Irglova does various jobs, cleaning house and working as a street vendor. She's also a hauntingly beautiful piano player and when the two of them begin playing music together their growing connection is a pleasure to watch. There are no melodramatic Hollywood style plot points to hang the story on, just a natural evolution of the relationship between these two likeable characters.

Once reminded me so much of my experiences and friendships in Dublin in the 90's that it gave me nostalgia pains. I didn't know these two particular people in Dublin in the 90's but I feel like I did. I feel like one - or both of them - sat down with me in some pub, cheap restaurant or drafty flat and told me the story of them.",1202688000,,917,4.591463414634147

Specially as the main characters are not popular and experienced but these two are amazing... and their music too. i was really liked the first part of the movie and just realized that this man (Hansard) can actually sing and play guitar. It was not  just a lip singing. I never heard of Hansard or that lovely girl until I watched this movie. And the end of story, I was curious to find out who they are and their music.

Little disappointed about the end of story and just expected little more rich ending.....and another down side is lack of lighting and don't know whether it done purposely but it seems like low budget film.

My friend, who knows music comparatively critically better than I do, says that Hansen here is a sell-out rich musician. This is still a great movie. I think stories told well, like Rogers & Hammerstein told with music and lyrics genuinely shared have at least as great value as anything BOLD and ALTERNATIVE as plain as heard here. Really great without the pretense that may follow from the purity from true critics as the genuine critical nod from better informed ears as my friend John.

3232097,4,B000X1Z0BU,"With multiple film festival award wins (and a recent Oscar nod) and produced on a shoestring budget (in just 17 days), ONCE is an independent movie marvel. But this isn't what should draw you to it. The draw should be its quirky humor, its incredible music (nearly 2/3 of the film is entirely music), and its intimate portrayal of two people making music while forming a strong bond of friendship.

The main actor and actress aren't even given names; there's no reason to as this Guy (played by guitarist extraordinaire Glen Hansard) and Girl (pianist Marketa Irglova) could be anyone off the street. Anyone with an incredible gift for music, that is. Both Guy and Girl work differing jobs than their hearts desire, Guy as a Hoover vacuum cleaner repairman and Girl as a house cleaner. But both have aspirations toward music, Guy more than Girl ...initially. Guy, on his off-time from the Hoover shop, panhandles on a street corner, belting out known songs during the day and his own at night (when no one's around). Girl discovers him and asks him why he doesn't play his own music during the day, and thus starts a series of events that speed this short film to a satisfying conclusion. I say ""speed"" in the sense of how short and sweet the film is, not because it is an action or speedy-type film in any way, shape, or form. In fact, if you were going to ding the film for anything, it would be its pacing. Sometimes achingly slow, the story nearly stalls at several points, but thankfully never falters completely.

The music is what makes Once what it is, and rightfully so. This is a story about musical wishes and dreams, and how those dreams should never be let go of no matter what the circumstances. Sometimes it takes a wallop upside the head to get you back to your dreams, and Girl is exactly the smack Guy needed in order to accomplish his. Her enjoyment of his songs and her persistent requests to hear more and more from him drive Guy to higher and higher levels. Although much of Guys' songs are based around a former relationship gone sour, it is Girl that opens his eyes to the fact that he still loves his girlfriend and his music ...and this awakening is all thanks to a platonic relationship with a stunningly pretty Czech (Girl).

Although Girl gives Guy what he needs, he too gives her something in return. Both come to understand how important their friendship is and what it will eventually mean to them, even should their dreams fail. Chasing after them no matter what the cost becomes all too evident as the film winds to a close.

You can't comment on Once without noting its camera work, too. It is very amateurish, almost as if someone were filming an episode of Wayne's World (in Wayne's basement). But it is the amateurish nature that binds the audience to the characters. You feel like you are the camera, peeking at these peoples' intimate lives from behind this corner or through that window.

And the music; it's impressive in the extreme, so much so it got nominated for Best Achievement in Music via the Oscars this year (2008), something of a shock for such a low budget film (much smaller than any previous nominee). Glen Hansard has ""the voice"" and his co-actress, Marketa Iglova, is no slouch either. Both are musical talents that can make you laugh one minute and nearly bring you to tears the next. And since over 60% of the film is music, that's a very good thing. In fact, for Once, it's the only thing.",1202428800,4,3450,4.576051779935275

3232102,4,B000X1Z0BU,"I've picked the DVD box up and turned it over at least ten times since the DVD release of Once. Finally I rented it.

Once is not a film for mere observers looking for light-hearted entertainment. Instead it's one of those movies that requires an emotional connection. Unless you regularly watch foreign films, you might want to tread carefully because this film is very typical of the slower story telling pace. If you are looking for a love story and a date movie, you are likely to be disappointed. But if you love fragments of reality in literature, art and song, you may find Once very fulfilling.

Once is a character study of two lonely people, both heart-broken in love, and by life. It's almost as if the camera follows them documentary-style through the humdrumness of their lives. But they spark as they connect over shared dreams -- music.

There is a poignant heaviness that colors the film a little drab. The song lyrics weave brokeness through simple folksy flavored acoustic melodies.

If you aren't certain, rent it before buying. Read all the reviews. If you hated Lost in Translation or didn't get it, Once isn't for you. If you hate dialogue, normal activities of daily living and little action, this movie is not for you. But if you seek the human condition and delight in rekindled dreams, check it out.

One warning. It's rated R for language and the F-bomb is frequent flyer. Usually it makes cluster appearances during tense scenes rather than being peppered throughout.",1202342400,,1495,4.801556420233463
3232103,1,B000X1Z0BU,"This movie was an absolute bore. there was no chemistry between the characters...the music was long and dull. My husband slept through it and I fast forwarded through the ""music."" The characters weren't endearing. The best part was the scenery.",1202256000,8,244,5.125

Any real musician will appreciate this story and any one that is aware that life is not a coincidence will understand and be grateful for the synchronistic values in the way this story plays out.

My husband is a musician and songwriter and was absolutely blown away by the music, it was so simple but powerful and emotional.

3232106,5,B000X1Z0BU,"This little film quietly sneaks up on you. The realistic portrayal of 2 people who briefly meet, flirt with the possibilities of romance, and then create music is not much of a story that would attract average American filmgoers, but if you let it take you there, you will be glad for the trip it takes you on. Set in modern Dublin, the film expertly captures the city and the role that music plays in the Irish heart. The music is absolutely astonishing and you will be amazed by the long sequence of music creation that is the heart of this film, and you might, as I did, be unable to get the tunes out of your head for weeks.
Rarely has the creative process been captured as well as in this production.",1202169600,,705,4.30827067669173
3232107,5,B000X1Z0BU,"I have to say, before I begin, that a great resonance of this film for me was the fact that it evoked my own musical past.  A Boston-based musician ""back in the day"" (WAY back!) I lived many of the same moments as ""He"" does in the film.

That said, this is essentially a boy-meets-girls story, the twist being that He and She are both musicians.  But unlike most Hollywood-driven stories of this genre, the relationship is only a secondary focus.  Rather, it is the music that is at center stage...and what music it is.  Simple, real, and from the heart, it is the music and its development that carries the story forward.

The two leads, He and She (for neither we nor they actually ever learn the characters' names) are played superbly by Glen Hansard and Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute;, non-actors, but also real life friends and musical collaborators.  He is played with earnest honesty (Hansard is essentially playing himself), and She is portrayed as whimsical, slightly ethereal, and strong-yet vulnerable.  Yet the lack of a Hollywood ham-fisted touch is clearly evident not only in the low budget, almost documentary style of John Carney's spot-on direction, but also in the evolution of the characters' story.  For while this is clearly a love story, it does not follow standard Hollywood protocol.  Indeed, there is no seal-the-deal first kiss, no sex, and the two characters do not set off into the sunset together.  Instead, they come together, enrich one another's lives, and then follow their individual paths...wherever those may lead.

But this is not to say that the story or the film is lacking, for in place of the usual detailed unfolding of an intimate relationship to rivet the audience's attentions and emotions, here we get to witness the unfolding of the music, as ""His"" songs are slowly transformed from solo street ballads into remarkably listenable arrangements by a pick-up band of nameless street musicians...and recorded ""simply because.""

It was in watching this unfolding that I was personally the most captured, because I have known the wonder Hansard perfectly captures and portrays as he first hears Irglov&aacute; accompany him on one of his songs.  I have lived the rush he experiences when his little accidental band suddenly transforms his solo efforts into something that somehow magically exceeds the limits of its own creation.  And I also lived through looking in the mirror, as He does, and realizing that all of his musical efforts ultimately spring from a crushed spirit.  While it is never explicitly touched upon in the movie, I wondered, as He goes off to apparently reclaim the track his life SHOULD have taken, whether he was wondering, as I did, whether his muse would leave once the hole in his spirit was healed and his heart was restored.

But perhaps I am projecting too much of my own story on this wonderful film, a movie that people may read into, but which certainly needs no help in touching the heart, the emotions, and the soul.  Well done!",1201737600,,3004,4.903162055335969

3232118,5,B000X1Z0BU,"In an age where the big budget Broadway style musicals are racing onto the screen, it's a simple low budget musical that's the real charmer.  Once looks like minimalist art cinema at first glance - hand held shots, documentary style film making.  No elaborate stages, special effects or gorgeous technicolor that encompasses the modern musical.

Rather, the film simply tells the story of a chance meeting between an unnamed man and unnamed woman who seem to share only a love for music and a lack of monetary affluence.  Yet thrugh music, their aspirations seem to grow, as does their relationship.  Despite the lack of grandiose compositions in the broadway fashion, the songs direct the course of the characters and are the cornerstone of the film, as it has little dialogue.

Glen Hansard has been making music for years and has been featured on film in the past in the Committments, yet doesn't strike you as an actor.  But it's the naturalistic approach of his and Marketa Irglova's performance that makes the film so great.  It feels like we're feeling and following the passion of these two characters.  Overall it's a lovely combination of filmaking technique, raw feeling, and an excellent enjoyable soundtrack that makes this film so great.",1201046400,,1251,4.975961538461538
3232119,5,B000X1Z0BU,"Once is an excellent movie about a touching friendship between a man and a woman simply named Guy and Girl. Guy (Glen Hansard) and Girl (Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute;) meet when Girl stops to listen to Guy playing songs on his guitar for money on the street. Guy and Girl form a singularly beautiful relationship and the plot moves along very nicely.

Guy and Girl come to know each other very well in a very short span of time--barely more than a week. Girl wants Guy to pick himself up and realize his dreams. She encourages Guy to make recordings of his songs with a band for a commercial CD so Guy can have fame as a musician. Guy seems confused as to whether or not Girl loves him; and there's a very well done scene in which Guy asks Girl to spend the night with him but she leaves.

Girl, of course, has her own issues. Girl, her mother and daughter are in Ireland because Girl's relationship with her husband didn't work out. Girl likes spending time with Guy; she likes getting attention from a nice man and she eventually helps him in his recording sessions.

Of course, from here the plot can go just about anywhere. Will Guy and Girl consummate their relationship? Will Guy go back to his former girlfriend in London? What will Girl do to support her child and mother in Ireland? Is there any hope for Guy to make his CD a success? No plot spoilers here, folks--you'll just have to watch the movie to find out!

The cinematography works so well partially because the hand held camera helps to set the thoughtful mood for this movie. The choreography works wonders in the opening theft scene and other scenes as well.

The DVD comes with commentaries and a couple of interesting extras about how they made the film. Great!

Overall, Once is a fine movie that people will enjoy if they like thoughtful movies about people and relationships in real life. Guy and Girl are not rich; and we see how they must work to support themselves while yearning to break free and be full fledged artists. The action moves along nicely, too.

This movie reminded me of that time. The movie showed the openness and intimacy songwriters have in playing their songs for an audience. The hoover shop where the guy musician worked with his father looked like vaccuum repair shops in Iowa. The apartments were the apartments of people who lived by scratching out a living. The movie seemed universal to me. My favorite moment in the movie was the scene when the couple first played together in the music shop. I thought it was electric.

3232129,5,B000X1Z0BU,"My review title sums it up pretty well, I think.  This is a brilliant concept in the movie-musical genre.  The music is integrated naturally within the storyline instead of being imposed from outside.  And what a wonderful choice, to have the actors be the very artists who wrote the music!  This works all the better and makes for such touching and tender scenes because the actors were in the process of falling in love during the filming.  There is a palpable chemistry between Marketa and Glen throughout, and at the end, you feel that you've experienced something truly rare, human, and beautiful.  And what can I say about the music that hasn't already been said?  These are gorgeously haunting melodies that will stick in your mind long after the movie is over.  A couple of the songs, Falling Slowly and If You Want Me, are Oscar contenders this year.

By the way, Marketa's character replies in Czech to Glen's question ""Do you love your husband?""  She says, ""Miluju tebe."" and then refuses to translate.  So, he never knows what she said.  You can look it up!  This and some other plot details that I won't go into lead me to disagree with some other reviewers here who say this movie is all about ""friendship.""

""Once"" is a story about a man and a woman who conduct a courtship almost entirely through song.  Music being the primary medium in which these two individuals move through life, it is only appropriate that they should express their love for one another through music as well.

Glen Hansard plays a struggling songwriter/musician whose recent, emotionally devastating breakup with the girl of his dreams now serves as the inspiration for most of his lyrics.  Marketa Irglova is a young woman who recently emigrated from the Czech Republic with her mother and daughter to begin a new life in Ireland.  She, too, is a composer of music, though she is less assertive and confident about exposing it to others than he is.  The two meet on the street one night while he is performing one of his original compositions and they begin a slow, tentative relationship based largely on their mutual love of music.

""Once"" is a beautiful, lyrical and heartbreaking film that has understandably garnered a passionate cult following since its release in early 2007.  It is an utterly unique and spellbinding work in which the music is every bit as important as the dialogue.  The plot, though basic and uncluttered, still manages to throw a few curveballs our way in an acknowledgment that romantic relationships do not always work out in the way we`d like.  Filmmaker John Carney keeps it as simple and intimate in his directorial style as he does in his writing, utilizing an unobtrusive and relatively steady handheld camera that nicely matches the rhythms and beats of the music playing in the background (and often in the foreground).  The scene in which the camera, in a single unbroken shot, moves ahead of Irglova as she strolls along the streets of the city singing an original composition is one of the truly transcendent movie moments of 2007.  And the music itself is lovely, flavorful and memorable - reason alone, I'd say, for seeing the film.

In addition to their obvious talents as singers and musicians, Hansard and Irglova give performances of such poignancy and subtle emotion that they draw us instantly into the hearts of their characters.

If ""Once"" reminds us of any film, it is probably the French classic, ""A Man and a Woman,"" another work whose tale of romantic love was intimately woven through music (although, in that film, the characters themselves were not singing or composing works).  That's not a bad template for a romantic movie, when you get right down to it.

Since ""Once"" is a film that it is much better to experience than it is to read about, I suggest you try it on for yourself.  You won't regret it.",1200182400,,2638,4.8137472283813745

To me the worst book I've ever read is better than the best movie I've watched. When I browse the Amazon bestseller list, I skip the movie category no matter what is hot in it. I was totally disappointed with these Hollywood potboilers. I hate wasting time in selecting-watching-being-disappointed format. I love music, I spend a lot of time on Amazon music section. As far as I can tell, since last summer, Once has been always in top 100, maybe top 50. But I didn't even try the sample, because I've never heard of Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova.

Yesterday, when I'm doing my routine browse on Amazon, the CD finally caught my eye. I clicked the link then found it was the music from the movie Once. I listened to the samples, then decided to watch the indie(though only 4.5 stars on Amazon, but the samples from OST added another .5). It's only 86 minutes, It won't take a long time.

I didn't budge an inch on my chair during the movie, even the credits began to roll. I couldn't even believe when It ended. How can it end so fast, what's next? The movie is just incredibly beautiful, I know that foreign movies are much better than Hollywood's(Whale Rider, Pan's Labyrinth, the Sea Inside), this one is another find in 2007, I just don't know how to simplify my feelings.

The story is simple, the friendship and chemistry between two main characters are convincing and touching, the performance was down-to-earth, no exaggeration, no special-effect of course, but full of warmness and sincerity. The music is passionate and delighting. So what else do you want for a movie about real life? Conspiracy? Ghost? Exploit?

It's a simple story, but set in a real world where nothing is as simple as it might seem. The music is brilliant (I would compare it to the work of Damien Rice, though I think the voice of the man in this film is even stronger), and pervades the film, making it into something of a musical with lyrics that express indirectly the feelings of the characters and convey details of their pasts and their lives that lends a richness to the simple connection that is obvious between the two characters. The acting is strong, and while the cinematography is not as lush or polished as in more expensive films, it is just right for this story, and puts the emphasis on the characters where it needs to be.

They were real and with our hyper-entertainment real is boring for most but if you keep watching you will be drawn in. I loved the way that guy sang better at the end of the movie than at the beginning, girl inspired him and motivated him. That's what good relationships do, they make us better. The ending is not fairy-tale but I am so happy that they kept it a good moral ending, so unlike Hollywood where lust and passion nearly always takes over.

3232143,5,B000X1Z0BU,"There's something pure about `Once'.  Instead of taking the route of most films in this genre it steers away from the drugs and immoral clich&eacute;s of musician pieces and focuses on the passion behind the music, the experiences and emotions that drive these two individuals to create beautiful music together.  `Once' is truly a one of a kid film, a beautiful and mesmerizing musical journey that comes only once in a great while.

The story told is that of your classic boy meets girl story (or `guy' meets girl story) where we are introduced to a young man who plays music on the streets for money and fixes vacuums in his fathers shop, as well as a young girl who has a broken vacuum and a love for music.  They meet by chance but share a connection that no words can put into perspective for the audience.  It's through their music though that their connection is made manifest.  They are drawn to each other and we are drawn to them.  They fall in love, but a love that is not like most experienced in the cinema today, this is a pure love, a love of character and emotion, a love of human beings and not carnal desire.  This guy falls for this girl and she likewise falls for him because they share a common bond you don't share with just anyone.

The film takes place over the course of a week where are two companions decide to make a record together.  They buy the studio time, they rehearse and then ultimately they record their album.  That is your story, but the story runs so much deeper than that.  When I watched `Dreamgirls' last year I was fortified in my belief that singing can be the purest for of acting, but `Once' takes the feeling of `Dreamgirls' and carries it much further.  When we watch actors (and real life musicians) Glen Hansard and Marketa Iglova sing their songs (songs they themselves have written) we feel every ounce of emotion.  We feel compelled to respond to their calls, they pleads; their desires.  We are taken deep into their souls.

One thing to notice when watching `Once' is that neither our main actor or our main actress is given a name.  This to me makes it all the more relatable.  These two could be anyone in the world, they could be you or I or our friends.  By not giving them a title other than `guy' and `girl' they become even more understandable and accessible.  I truly adore this aspect of the film.

As a longstanding fan of the Irish pub music made popular by the amazingly talented Damien Rice I was thrilled to see Glen Hansard do this film.  His musical style is breathtaking and warm and he delivers a very strong performance for someone who is not a quote-unquote `actor'.  Marketa Irglova also delivers beautifully.  Both are very natural and convincing, portraying real people, no gimmicks or dramatized emotions.  They add to the pure quality I mentioned on the outset.  This movie feels real; it feels natural and graceful and in the end attains all my respect and admiration.  One of the best films of the year, most definitely.",1200009600,,3004,4.5353159851301115

At the end of the film, I was dissapointed. Was that it? Were they not going to consemate their love for each other? Did they love each other? Wait, the lead characters were never given a name?!

 Maybe I was a little slow the night I watched it, but it took a little thinking afterwards to completely understand the movie, or at least take it the way that I did.

 The story of Once can be summed up by saying that Guy meet Girl and they make music together. That's what it was the second after viewing, but an hour or so later, I realized that their love was shown. It was shown the only it could have been shown, and that was through the music they made together.

 After it clicked for me, I smiled. John Carney has written a sort of forbidden love story using music. The interactions given by our leads, Glen Hansard and Markta Irglov, are near perfection. The whole vacuum bit had me sold for Girl.

 In the end, the whole tone of the film left a bittersweet feeling. I felt for Guy and Girl. I felt for the lack of their love. They'll always have their music. And great, great music it is.",1199664000,3,1257,4.2301255230125525

Chalk full of emotion, the lyrics and both the male and female voices have a transcending quality that stops you in your tracks and insists you listen.

The characters (guy and girl) are understated, modest, and very real. There doesn't seem to be any acting going on, but it's a little like a documentary. He, the guy, is a guitarist, a singer-songwriter, singing for his supper in the off-hours of his job as a vacuum cleaner repairman. She, the girl, is Czech, a pianist, likes his music and happens to have a ""Hoover"" in need of repair. He sings on the streets, she sells flowers on the streets. Their ultimate meeting is not remarkable, but their unlikely coupling as a musical duo is. When they first sing together, there's immediate harmony. With the girl as muse, they find their way down a musical path and as I watched, I felt that no matter what was going to happen, everything about the film felt successful. It had a hand-made quality to it that felt believable.

Shot mainly on the recognizable streets of Dublin, it's all very Irish and utterly charming. Highly recommend.

It is the result of the chance meeting of a young guitar player singing in the street and a young pianist and slightly composer just passing by and listening. The meeting of the two, though starting on a bad foot: ten cents in the street for one full song and later his more than lame proposal though he knew nothing about her. He will learn later she is Czech, married, has a child and is living in Ireland with her mother and her child waiting for her husband to join them. In spite of that a collaboration becomes possible and a full CD is composed, rehearsed, recorded and burnt in time for him to go to London to work with some producers. He invites her on his last night in Ireland and she accepts but will not come and his only farewell will come from his father. On the following morning he goes away but stops in a music store and has a piano delivered to her. End of story: the piano is delivered and used with the finally arrived husband. Charming story in which artistic gifts and desires are not always expressed, do not always find their way to some audience, and may be completely wrecked by some horny or kinky illumination. But when art leads beyond this skin deep impulse there can be a way to some achievement. In many ways a good Irish hence catholic film in which Catholicism is some kind of morality that leads to a certain life style.

3232153,5,B000X1Z0BU,"I was a bit sceptical when my girlfriend ordered this film on Netflix for us to watch thinking it was just going to be a complete ""chick flick"" but it was absolutely wonderful.  It's not a ""chick flick"", it's an ""Amature Musicans Flick"".  The film is so true to life about the thoughts, feelings, and emotions of an amature musicians who is just writing and singing from the heart.  Especially if you've been severely hurt by a significant other as I have, so I could very much identify with Guy's lyrics as they are very true to the heart.  There are three main reasons this film is incredible.

1) The music.  Simply put, the song writing in this film is incredible.  Being a musican myself, I understand how the music industry works (been offered more than one record deal so I'm no stranger to the industry) and I don't see these songs as selling out stadiums, but rather having a strong underground following like a Dunkan Sheik.  The songs are from the heart and very authentic.  At first I thought the lyrics were toying with being cliche, but they are put together in a manor that they don't quite cross over and actually end up being quite amazing.  They convey real feelings and real emotions in a way that is accessible for the veiwer to identify with and make them personal to their own experience.  For the true musician, music is life and lyrics are your soul.  I was moved to tears in the scene where the two main characters are in the music shop playing their first song together.  Not only is it amazing to hear how they come together but the lyrics to the song truly hit home.  All in all, great song writing and arangement.

2) True to life interaction.  The interaction between the two main characters is incredibly real to life.  I had something similar happen to me with a girl that just heard me playing/singing one day and we were inseprable for a short period of time playing music together and what not.  When you have the bond of music, it's a different type of interaction.  It's like you truly know someone and can see their soul.  You see that in the interaction between these two.  No secrets because you know that they won't hurt you.  It's just incredible and I think this film really captured that.

3) The ending.  The film truly leaves you wanting.  I won't say how it ends for those who haven't seen it, but the ending is true to what probably would happen in real life and it leaves you with such mixed emotions.

I played this on Christmas day and as the music unfolded, my relatives gradually congregated around the TV to watch and enjoy Guy and Girl. Smiles and Tears. Please buy or rent this film and experience what we found to be truly uplifting. ""If your mind's made up......""",1198972800,,659,4.641025641025641
3232161,5,B000X1Z0BU,"While this movie is often termed a musical, I think that is a misnomer. Yes, it is a film about two musicians, one male and the other female. Yes, music does play a prominent part in this film. Yes, there is one scene (on a bus as I recall) where the guy breaks into song when describing the love of his life to the girl beside him, someone relatively new in his life. Yes, there are lots of band rehearsals and all that.

But this isn't Grease or Hairspray or Les Miserables or even Sweeney Todd. It isn't THAT kind of musical. So I think the word doesn't do justice to the film. It is very watchable even for those who tend to hate musicals.

The plot, such as it is, focuses on a guy who is trying to figure out what to do with his life in the wake of a breakup. Along comes a rather chatty young woman who hangs out with him and the two hit it off. I don't want to mislead the potential viewer  so let me stress that ""hitting it off"" is not a way of saying there is high drama and passion.

The delight of this film is that it is low-key, intentionally so (if you get the DVD be sure and watch what the director says about the film). It isn't meant to be a typical Hollywood blockbuster but more of a slice of life film.

I loved it, absolutely,totally - as did my son. He liked the music a great deal, much of it vocal music. While I appreciated that, I also enjoyed the refreshing look at two people who were helping and supporting one another as they struggled to figure out how their lives had gotten off track - and where to go from there.

I think that gives you enough of a basis to figure out if the film is worth viewing. I'd urge you to see it. If you want high drama or suspense or a mystery thriller then don't take a chance on it. If you are up for a good film, nicely done, about two people and the normal ups and downs of life (especially as musicians), you're likely to enjoy this.",1198972800,5,1901,4.042553191489362

3232165,5,B000X1Z0BU,"It's a hard knocks life playing music on the sordid streets of Dublin, Ireland. ""Once"" opens with clear proof of that as our protagonist, Guy (Glen Hansard from the ""Commitments""), has to chase down a thief who's stolen his guitar case full of tips.

But not all of Guy's encounters are so negative.  By chance, he encounters 'Girl', a Czech immigrant who turns out to be a talented pianist.

They form a friendship.  Then they begin to perform together, which blossoms into a band and a CD. This is definitely not a romance. Guy's still trying to resolve an old relationship with a girl who left him and Girl's married with a daughter til near the end of the film.

What ""Once"" is is honest dialog between two people about their dreams, their lives.

All this and the music is wonderful as well.  It's a folky-bluesy theme written by the two co-stars.  What's interesting is that the music, like a character in itself, evolves through the film.

""Falling"" has received a great deal of radio play, particularly on my favorite Austin-based radio station.  The song that made me laugh was ""Broken Hearted Hoover Fixer Sucker Guy"".  Now, that is an original title and very much real life.  I'm adding the soundtrack to my wish list and if the spouse likes the film, I may well end up purchasing the DVD as well.

Warnings:

To me, both Guy and Girl are fairly easy to understand, but if you have trouble with accents, you may want to turn on closed captioning

I watched this movie with my mom, stepdad, and husband and we were all blown away, despite our different tastes in music.  This movie will leave you wanting to hear the songs over and over again.  I literally watched the movie three times in a row because I thought that highly of it.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.  I've already purchased the sound track and DVD.

3232167,1,B000X1Z0BU,"At Gitmo, one of the things the interrogators do to `break' prisoners is to subject them to prolonged exposure to songs from TV's Sesame Street.  It turns out that even when it's designed to be benign or even therapeutic, being forced to listen to certain music truly is torture.  Also at Gitmo, if a `detainee' tries to end his suffering by means of starvation, the U.S. military will force feed him so as to prevent this.

'Once' is a force-feeding of folk music.

The musical performances are characterized by an affected earnestness and a self-styled soulfulness.  They are self-conscious without being self-aware: in other words, a pre-ironic mindset.  Watching them made me uncomfortable in the way that one is uncomfortable when a nave, sensitive, and bad poet insists upon reading you his work and asking for feedback.

This film is photographed with a blurry, hand held camera, and to say that the script is minimalist is an understatement. It is possible to momentarily forget that this film is fiction, that someone scripted this.  In my opinion, this is a deliberate cheat, a gimmick to conceal the thinness, corniness, and improbability of the plot.

This is `The Blair Witch Project,' but with music.

There is a sense of arrested development with Glen Hansard's character, a self-pitying 36-year-old still living at his father's house.  It's creepy to know that when this movie was made, Marketa Irglova was just 18.  The pair are reported to `dating' nowadays, and it is reasonable to suspect that the relationship was probably not `platonic' when they were composing and performing together prior to filming.

In short, this film feels like the fantasy of a college sophomore, neglecting his classes in hopes that music will be his ticket out.  If you have ever wondered what it would be like to have a street musician move in with you, I strongly recommend this movie.  It makes 85 minutes seem like a month.",1198713600,27,1926,4.919504643962848

3232175,5,B000X1Z0BU,"Once is the street magician of musicals; its natural efficiency makes Dreamgirls look like Sigfried & Roy--a sparkling make-under of its genre, and a lovely sigh of a film.

I agree with the other reviewers that it resembles Before Sunrise in realistic style and pacing--except Once uses music in place of introspective conversation to achieve a sensory magic that only music can stimulate.  You don't even have to be a fan of this kind of music to experience the fullness of the story through it.

Amazon's clip of the two leads (played by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglov, neither of their characters is named) first harmonizing in the music shop is the perfect selection. It comes about 15 minutes in, and is where the film (by the director's own admission) really starts. It's a very tentative moment of connection through a song, itself of searching for connection, that evokes Trufaut's ""400 Blows"" in the way it brings the viewer into the equation. It's a brilliant sensory parallel: While listening to the music, experiencing each note and at the same time anticipating the next in the melody, the viewer also watches in wonderment and waiting, trying to understand what is going on between these two obscure people at that exact moment, and trying to detect what they will be in the moment after that.

The actors are both untrained, but it's neither evident nor non-evident in their performances. Sorry, that was a terribly composed sentence--what I mean is, while their performances are subtle and richly felt, they aren't ""naturals"" at acting; they ARE, however, naturals in their particular roles in this particular film.  They just fit, and everything about it just feels right somehow.  So much so that I wasn't at all surprised to discover that the lead actors were friends who met 6-7 years before, and that they began to see each other in a romantic light during filming. Hansard, 37, demonstrates an affecting hesitation and tentativeness around Irglov, who is 19, that is appropriate both for the plot, and the real-life fact that she is so young.

In the excellent commentary with the actors and director, the director notes that the original script called for a kiss, and Hansard refused and wasn't comfortable with it.  The grey area of romantic appropriateness befits the plot (the title denotes man's hesitation to act, waiting for ""Once this-or-that happens""), and makes the characters' interactions more interesting, striking a perfect balance between discomfort and harmony.

The fact that this was shot in 17 days for $175,000 is pretty amazing.  But, again, it seems to add to the film for the better, giving it an improvisational and true-to-life feeling.  The sets are real places in Dublin, adding to the sense that all this could've happened yesterday, and maybe it will happen tomorrow, you never know.

This is just one of those rare, rare movies where all the behind-the-scenes events and interpersonal relationships are so oddly, perfectly manifest in the finished product.

The DVD includes commentary by the actors and director on both the film and the songs.  Subtitles are accessible in English, Spanish and French so you can follow along the lyrics.  There are two brief but entertaining making-of-type featurettes as well.

My one gripe: The R-rating is truly puzzling. On what planet, MPAA?  There is no nudity, not even a kiss, and no violence.  Some strong language, but barely that.",1198195200,,3429,5.017636684303351
3232176,4,B000X1Z0BU,"""Once"" is an attempt at a musical for modern audiences, in which the characters express themselves through music but don't burst into song in places where it seems inappropriate. The two main characters are musicians, so it's natural for their feelings to be reflected in the songs they write. A street musician (Glen Hansard) in Dublin, Ireland sings popular covers by day and is trying out his own music on passersby at night when a friendly and somewhat impertinent street vendor (Marketa Irglova) stops to talk. It turns out that she is a classically trained pianist from the Czech Republic. The busker never had much ambition, but he is inspired by a fruitful collaboration with his new friend and finally motivated to record his music.

You may recognize Glen Hansard as the frontman for the Irish band The Frames. John Carney, who wrote and directed the film, was formerly a band member. His philosophy in casting was to get ""really good singers who can half-act"" instead of settling for actors with mediocre musical talents. Hansard and Irglova are not professional actors, so ""Once"" uses a lot of long lenses by necessity. It's shot documentary style with some handheld work, but only occasionally shaky. The awkwardness of the characters' relationship and the man's palpable frustration create a strong sense of realism. Ironically, the only thing that feels self-conscious and inauthentic is that we so rarely hear the characters names spoken. Several of the songs are quite good, and they do, indeed, seem natural in their context.

The DVD (20th Century Fox 2007): There are 4 featurettes and an audio commentary. ""Making a Modern Day Musical"" (12 min) interviews John Carney about his inspiration and approach, working on a micro budget, non-actors, and Glen Hansard about writing the songs. ""More Guy, More Girl"" (9 min) talks to the director and actors about the characters' relationship and audience reaction. ""Broken Hearted Hoover Fixer Guy"" (1 min) is a webisode animated with stick figures. ""Musical Commentary with writer-director John Carney and actor/musicians Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova"" takes us through the13 songs and fragments with commentary on filming and performing them. The audio commentary with John Carney, Glen Hansard, and Marketa Irglova comments scene-by-scene on characters, filming, the role of music, genesis of the project, locations, the director's intentions.

3232177,4,B000X1Z0BU,"There is much to love about the quirky little film ONCE: it is honest, simple, transparent, and made with a low budget and lots of love.  The leading characters are gentle people who happen to sing as well as act and the love story they create is a fragile little tale that remains in the air as a nice memory after the credits are past.

A Dublin busker (Glen Hansard) is a songwriter and singer who plies his music on the streets when his is not helping his warmly generous father (Bill Hodnett) in his vacuum repair shop: his songs reflect a ruptured love affair and are sensitively poignant.  Along comes a Czech girl (Markta Irglov) who sells flowers on the streets but is impressed enough with the lad's music to stop, listen, and even put ten cents in his case.  The two strike up a friendship (the girl plays the piano in a music shop during lunch hour) and in time these two bruised people interact in the wavelength of their love of music.  The lad meets the girl's daughter and mother (Danuse Ktrestova) - the father of the child is still in the Czech Republic -,  they all become friends, and with the help of a few fellow musicians they cut a recording that hopefully will launch the lad's career in a trip to London.  The mood of the extemporaneous feeling piece is one of developing love that can only happen once, especially given the histories of each of the two musicians.

Writer/director John Carney demonstrates how a simple story can be made into a touching film for under $150,000. and on a shooting schedule of 17 days.  The featurettes have just as much tenderness in outlining the production of the film as the film itself.  The only problem with the film for this viewer is the music, which seems redundant and repetitive: for those who favor this type of music this will not be a 'flaw'.  It is admirable that films like this are being made, restoring our faith in honest craftsmanship backed by warmth of intent. Grady Harp, December 07",1198108800,6,1965,4.522598870056497

I just purchased the Once DVD(U.S. Version - NTSC), and the experience was ruined due to the fact that the movie seemed to be playing back slower than normal making all of the songs play in a lower key, and all of the actor's voices lower than normal.  I am not sure if this was noticed at the authoring house, but the final DVD is not true to the original recording.  I tried the DVD in several different players, and even returned the first DVD but still had the same result with the replacement.  I'm sure that many people will notice this right away.

He has a great, emotional voice that comes through on the songs that he sings and is reminiscent of Richard Thompson. It gives the music a powerful punch and depth. He plays a character still haunted by a past relationship and this bleeds into his songs. Marketa Irglova brings a quiet, understated charm to her role. It's a wonderfully unaffected performance and the two of them have terrific chemistry together.

These two musicians compliment each other well, encouraging each other's musical ideas. Think of this film as The Commitments: Unplugged. Once is one of those rare films where the actors are actually playing their instruments and singing instead of aping along to someone else's music. Hansard and Irglova are the real deal and this only adds to the enjoyment of the film. Once is personal, heartfelt filmmaking at its finest and a world away from the big budget bombast of a film like Dreamgirls.

There is an audio commentary by writer/director John Carney and actor/musicians Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova. Carney tends to dominate this track as he talks about the origins of the film's title. Irglova talks about the challenge of finding her character early on in the shoot. Hansard talks about his days with Carney in the band, The Frames and how he knew that Carney would go on to become a filmmaker.

All three also provide a commentary for all of the songs in the film. Hansard says that they did the busking scenes early on a Sunday morning to avoid being recognized. They talk over each musical number, sometimes telling the origin of a song.

""Making a Modern Day Musical."" Carney says that audiences have connected with the film because of its personal, intimate approach. Originally, Hansard wasn't going to be in the film but Carney liked the rehearsal footage of him with Irglova.

""More Guy, More Girl"" features Carney talking about the initial idea he had for the film. Cast and crew talk about making it with plenty of on-the-set footage which gives some insight into the creative process. Everyone speaks fondly of the filmmaking experience.

Given the opportunity to see Glen and Marketa performing as members of the Swell Season last month, I was amazed at how many people were touched by this movie. Based on the audience, the movie embraces people of all ages, from those still in their fundamental high school and college years to those who have experienced a bundle of springtimes. Perhaps it is all an act, but Glen and Marketa seem extremely genuine and seem to really enjoy making music together. What a great night that was.

Trying to make one as an independent feature minus all the Hollywood gloss and big production numbers is even tougher but then this film isn't your typical combination of music, drama and romance.

""Once"" manages to be both bold and marvelous at the same time. This delightful film tells the story of an Irish musician (Glen Hansard) who falls for a classically trained piano player and Czech immigrant (Marketa Irglova) who is living with her daughter and mother. The two discover a surprising musical compatibility as well in addition to their unexpected romance. A small independent release that disappeared from theaters as quickly as it opened, ""Once"" is one of those films that you can delightfully discover as it moves on to its second life on home video without feeling guilty about the quality.

Hansard who plays in the rock band Frames brings his character to life as much through song as he does through performance. Written and directed by Hansard's band mate John Carney, the film takes a bit to take off but once it does it soars. This isn't your fantasy musical however and Carney doesn't shy away from showing the hardship that two street musicians face in a world that largely gives them an unsympathetic ear.

The film looks quite good on DVD considering its low budget nature and feeling that it was shot on the fly. Audio sounds quite good as well with a crisp, clear quality that one might not expect on an independent film such as this.

We get an observant and intelligent commentary track by director Carney and his stars. They discuss everything from their characters in the film to making music. There is also a track specific commentary track with the trio as well. ""Making a Modern Day Musical"" is a very good featurette that focuses on the challenges that Carney faced with the musical genre as well as the difficulties he and the cast faced in trying to pull it off convincingly. ""More Guy, More Girl"" focuses on the unnamed main characters and their relationship. We also get the web featurette ""Broken Hearted Hoover Fixer Sucker Guy"" and the ability to download via your PC another web featurette which I didn't have time to review. Finally we get four trailers for unrelated but thematically similar films.

""Once"" is an absolute delight. It's unpretentious and focuses on what is missing from most modern day musicals--the characters, their relationship and their evolution vs. big production numbers and over-the-top tunes. The score is memorable as well and fans may want to pick it up. The DVD comes with some nice extras but, really, they are icing on an already rich cake.",1197763200,8,2699,4.845986984815618

Even more than the romance, it is about Dublin, about carrying on in fragile circumstances, and about giving oneself and others a second chance.  Those are, of course, themes more universal than individual, so it's entirely appropriate that the two protagonists are never named beyond Guy and Girl.  Even in that anonymity, however, they are finely drawn and portrayed individuals.  Once is a movie to see more often than its title.

3232198,5,B000X1Z0BU,"""Once"" is a real find. The story of a street musician who meets a Czech &eacute;migr&eacute; on the streets of downtown Dublin, is a believable, well-made film about love, dreams and making things happen.

Guy (Glen Hansard, a real musician who also appeared in the film ""The Commitments""), a street busker who sings his heart out on the streets of Dublin, works in his dad's vacuum repair shop. One day, a young lady (Marketa Irglova), a Czech immigrant, begins to ask him questions about his music, his passions, the inspiration for his ballads. They form a friendship and she encourages him to follow his dream and put together a demo album. As the friendship grows, she helps him negotiate a recording studio and practice the songs. In the process, she invites him into her home, to meet her mother and young daughter. During the course of their relationship, they grow closer, but she is still married and can't let anything happen. They round up some other musicians and begin to work on the demo, to help him with his dream.

""Once"", written and directed by John Carney, is a very intimate look at the relationship between these two people. A lot of handheld camera work, close shots and grungy, real locations help to give the film an incredible cinema verite look and style. The camera work is handheld, but not overly shaky, creating shots with an intimate, close appearance, really thrusting us into the middle of the action.

The relationship between Guy and Girl (as they are listed in the credits) is really an interesting one that draws you into their lives. Initially, the guy is a bit put off by the girl, she is extremely chatty and forthcoming, asking him a lot of questions about his music, why he sings certain songs, the inspiration, etc. As a street musician, he is naturally a little weary about people getting too close, he simply wants them to enjoy a little of the music and drop a couple of coins or bills into his guitar case and leave. So, the young woman who stops to ask questions, in her accented English, is a minor annoyance, until he realizes she is genuinely interested.

As their relationship grows, he feels a fondness for her, and as a single man, he naturally flirts with her. But when she realizes this is going too far, she gives him a little look, a minor reprimand, and he realizes she is right. They are friends, sharing an experience. And she is married, even if her husband still lives in the Czech Republic and they are having problems.

As they become friends, they become involved in each other's lives. He meets her mother and daughter, sees where she lives, has dinner at their house. She meets his dad and becomes involved in his making of a demo album.

When the duo shows up at the recording studio, with their fellow street musicians, the sound engineer greets them, but secretly reveals his true feelings to someone on his cell phone. He has a feeling this group is another example of people with too much ambition and not enough talent; they don't even know the technical details of recording the music. But when they start playing, he recognizes they have talent, the songs are good, and the lead singer, our guy, is quite good, so he becomes engrossed in making the demo as good as possible. He becomes a part of their team, investing part of himself in the production of the demo.

Part of the beauty of ""Once"" is that nothing seems forced. They don't have sex, simply to make the story more dramatic. In fact, the course of their relationship seems all the more real because they simply remain friends, close friends invested in each other's lives and livelihood. There aren't any manufactured crises involving her mother and baby or his dad. They simply struggle with real life.

Also, the music is quite good throughout the film. Guy sings a song, a love ballad he wrote for his girlfriend who moved away to London, a few times, each time making it a little better. Finally, when they record it for the demo, it is as good as it could be, with the girl playing keyboard and singing backup and the addition of the other musicians they have recruited.

""Once"" is a film about the guy following his dream. He wants to make a demo and travel to London, to try to get a contract. But perhaps more importantly, he wants to reunite with his girlfriend. All he needs is a little push, a little support and guidance from a friend. He finds that friendship with the girl, his new friend who helps him realize he should go for his dream.",1193616000,,4491,4.596754057428215

I just signed up to be notified, as I will be purchasing a copy for myself and for the person I saw the movie with.

I could go on and on about everything I love about this movie but instead I'll just say that this movie has a way of touching you emotionally that you won't expect. I went into the theater just expecting it to be yet another movie but it wasn't. It's a love story that anyone can relate to because the people involved are coping with real issues that get in the way of being with that one special person.

And the music... wow. Just... wow.",1193011200,,775,4.092105263157895
3232201,5,B000X1Z0BU,"This is one of those rare movies that defies any neat classification. It isn't a traditional love story by any stretch. Though it is filled with music from beginning to end it isn't really a musical. In the traditional musical characters will suddenly burst into song but it represented an interruption in the otherwise semi-realistic tone of the movie--think of Gene Kelly in SINGIN' IN THE RAIN. But all the songs in this film are in line with the overall realism of the film, they are all songs that occur in normal life.

I don't want to reveal much in the way of details about the movie since much of the joy of the film is discovering the ways it defies expectations. In broad outline it is about a street singer who has put his emotional life on cold storage because of a broken heart and the woman he meets who helps him open himself back up to life. During the day in Dublin he sings familiar standards for tips but at night, when the crowds thin out, he sings his own original material. We see him this way for the first time through the eyes of the Girl as she first meets him (in the credits the two lead characters, never addressed by name, are listed as Guy and Girl). He, played by Frames' frontman Glen Hansard, is singing an absolutely stunning song with intense passion. As he finishes, the camera pulls back to reveal her standing there. From thenceforward we see the two of them get to know each other as they perform a string of amazing songs together.

Neither Glen Hansard nor Markta Irglov is a professional actor. Hansard did have a prominent role in another great Dublin film about music, THE COMMITMENTS. In that one Hansard played the band's guitarist Outspan Foster, one of the two original members of the band (he is the one who resists the suggestion of the other original member to call their band A Flock of Budgies). In real life, of course, Hansard has long been the resident genius of the great Irish rock band The Frames and both one of the great singers in rock as well as an absolutely brilliant songwriter (neither of which anyone who sees this movie will be inclined to doubt). While visiting Prague a couple of years back he met a precocious teenager who was none other than Markta Irglov. One thing led to another and within a year of their meeting they recorded and album together entitled THE SWELL SEASON. Next they appeared in this film by John Carney, himself a former member of The Frames. So their time together has been amazingly productive (she also appeared on the critically acclaimed new album by the Frames, THE COST).

The film is filled with wonderful little moments, like the first meeting (driven by Hansard's magnificent performance of ""Say It To Me Now""). Or the way the sound engineer recording the Guy's song goes from disinterest to interest as he realizes just how good he is. Or the marvelous extended shot that follows the Girl from a convenience store where she has bought batteries for a CD player down the street for a few blocks as she sings the lyrics she has written for a song the Guy has written the music for.

This truly is a very special film. It does not have the greatest production values; indeed, it feels like the low budget that it is. It works because the two leads, while not professional actors, have a wonderful chemistry both romantically and musically and because Glen Hansard is one of the finest songwriters around. In fact, the soundtrack for the film has to go down as one of the greatest soundtracks ever released. I would urge anyone who loves the music in this film to investigate not merely the soundtrack for the film, but both THE SWELL SEASON, the album by Glen Hansard and Markta Irglov, and two albums by the Frames, FITZCARRALDO and THE COST.",1192752000,5,3747,4.563150074294205
3232202,5,B000X1Z0BU,"During this time of the year, most movie studios release those surefire moneymakers known as ""the summer blockbuster."" With movies like ""Pirates of the Caribbean 3,"" ""Spider-Man 3,"" ""Shrek the Third,"" ""Transformers,"" ""Fantastic Four 2,"" ""Ocean's Thirteen,"" and ""Live Free or Die Hard,"" it's hard to not be enticed into the studio's lure. But while these seasons come and go, and their neverending advertisements riddle our media, it's easy for most cinematic gems - ones more original and genuine - to fall out of our sights and sadly not be noticed until DVD release, if at all. One such gem is Fox Searchlight's release ""Once,"" starring Glen Hansard (only noticed as the red-headed guitarist Outspan Foster from Alan Parker's 1991 hit,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Commitments-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00018D3XW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Commitments (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>) and the beautiful, wistful Czech musician Marketa Irglova (whose voice somewhat resembles Tori Amos ... only Irglova's music is good).

Hansard is also known as guitarist and leading man of the music group The Frames (with which director John Carney was bassist), and while he and Irglova have previously teamed up to record ""The Swell Season"" album as well as open for Damien Rice (whom Hansard's music sometimes resembles) on his first tour, their meeting in ""Once"" is so earnest and real that you'd think it was the first time these people had met. I heard most of the movie was shot with a long range lens, thus shooting the actors from afar and giving the movie more of a documentary feel than a fictional film, which works immensely. ""Once"" has such a basic boy-meets-girl storyline but with much more meaning. And it's that simplicity that helps make the overall message of this film so beautiful. The main characters don't even trivialize with stating names; all that matters is the connection these two have - much like that of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Before-Sunrise/dp/B00002E224/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Before Sunrise</a>. However, unlike ""Sunrise,"" there is no pretension with these characters, who do more than have romantic feelings toward each other and avoid their rehashings of their pasts. Despite the fact that they're virtually strangers, Hansard and Irglova have faith in each other; something that's sorely lacking in today's society. The two have a wonderful chemistry and I heard that they are/were dating in real life.

Set in Dublin, Ireland, ""Once"" is the tale of a guy (Hansard) who's a vacuum repairman at his father's shop by day and a guitarist/busker by afternoons and evenings, trying his best to support his widowed father and get over a break-up with his girlfriend. One night, while performing one of his outstanding, passionate songs (""Say It To Me Now""), he's tipped by and meets a Czech girl (Irglova), who's amazed by his song and becomes somewhat of a fan. The next day, when bringing the guy her vacuum to repair, we learn that the girl is somewhat of a musician herself - she was trained by her father to be a damn good pianist. Shortly after, the two stop by a music shop where the girl plays piano for him and he soon is taking out one of his original songs for them to both sing. What follows is a simplistic-yet-magical scene set to a beautifully haunting song, ""Falling Slowly,"" where these characters bond. Without mincing words, this song is absolutely beautiful and brilliant! And it's a good precursor of what to expect from this film.

With many critics describing this movie as a musical, or as director Carney described it: a ""video album,"" it's easy to agree because the film's music is featured so prominently and is played to help form and mold the characters. At times, ""Once"" feels a bit like an epic music video, but with much more feeling and story. Each time a song comes on, you feel more drawn to these characters, their lives and the connection they have. If you don't like the music, then there's something seriously wrong with your taste and you should probably start reevaluating what you consider to be good, real music.

I won't disclose any more of the film or the several scenes I loved as I'm afraid that may take away from the visceral, feelgood emotions they invoke. All I will say is that ""Once"" is one of the best, innovative films I've seen in a long time. It's emotionally honest, the music is better than anything you'll hear on mainstream contemporary radio, and it'll leave you feeling both inspired and rejuvenated. This is not merely a film to see; it's a film to experience! There're so many emotions and memories that surface after viewing this film and that's the sign of a great movie! I have to admit that while I'll be among the masses going to see ""Live Free of Die Hard,"" the chance of me buying that movie on DVD is a lot more slim compared to my excitement in buying ""Once"" on DVD for multiple viewings! Between Hansard's humility and Irglova's charm, it's easy to fall in love with ""Once"" more than its title invokes.

Sadly, because it's an independent film, you may have problems locating a theater where it's playing - which is a shame because, really, how many showings do we need of ""Pirates of the Caribbean 3"" or ""Ocean's Thirteen""? But if you do notice ""Once"" on Netflix or at your local movie rental store, make it a top priority to see this film! Drop everything and just see it. Afterward, I'll even bet that you'll then soon be visiting a music store and buying the outstanding soundtrack or the duo's great preceding album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Swell-Season/dp/B000GH3CVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Swell Season</a>.",1192579200,17,5822,5.18278427205101

This is a charming story about two musicians who fall into an unconsummated love, but whose passion for each other is remarkable. And you can take the kids to it as everyone keeps their knickers on and apart from the occasional FECK! there's nothing to corrupt the minds of the tinkers.
The first 5 to 10 minutes of this film are so perfectly Dublin that it ought to be required viewing for anyone with an Irish avocation. And I'll leave it at that. The visual comedy of The Guy's guitar is just such a perfectly deft Dub stroke that it keeps all the sentimentality at bay. These are two souls who are joined by the passion of the music they create, and another of the perfect tones of the film is just how tellingly the story captures the songwriting and recording process. Having completed a couple of discs, I can tell you that they got it right, to the very last detail.
The tunes fit the story and while they may not be the greatest songs ever written, they have an emotional honesty that will remind you of Christy Moore or MIke Scott, and in that regard they are brilliant. In the end, the love goes unconsummated but not unrequited, and you'll just have to go see the film. I'll certainly pick it up on DVD as it reminds me of someone from a long time ago, and as I left the theatre, I could tell there were hosts of others with similar thoughts.

3232209,5,B000X1Z0BU,"""Once"" is an engaging and phenomenally sweet movie about young artists trying to find an outlet for their boundless need for expression. ""The Guy"" is a ragged Irish street singer with a beat-up guitar who reserves his own most pained and poignant works for the evening, when no one listens anyway. We encounter ""The Girl,"" a Czech street peddler of magazines and flowers, who also has a talent for music and who is attracted by the depth of the Guy's music. Given less talented writers, ""Once"" could quickly have devolved into romantic nonsense. But both the Guy and the Girl have unresolved romantic commitments that prevent them from easily falling into a tryst. Watching them grapple with their love and appreciation for each other while honoring their previous attachments is one of the joys of this movie.

""Once"" is basically a vehicle for publicizing the music of Glen Hansard and Markta Irglov -- the leads who actually wrote most of the music in the film. One suspects that the film is a lightly veiled version of their own stories. But, the locales and characters portrayed in the film are varied and interesting. From heroin addicts, to unemployed immigrants, to street musicians and poets singing for their dinner, the film is full of characters that are real and wonderful. The music is also quite charming -- especially if you are drawn to the kind of moody, introspective folk genre that is half crazed with regret, passion and mourning over lost relationships.

""Once"" is a wonderful tale of two people from different backgrounds who come together, for a moment, over a love of music. It is about getting unstuck from self-imposed limits. It is about taking chances and risking failure. It is about finding lost love and starting again. It is about life itself.

The music is really passionate, heartfelt, and it continues throughout the film. I have been blogging about this film, telling everyone I know that they must see it. To see the scenes where these characters are making music together. It's hard to explain just how beautiful it is to watch and to hear. I had the songs in my head the whole night and next day. I ordered the soundtrack right away and downloaded a few from blogs just to last me until the CD arrived. I will buy this film the instant it is released and plan to watch it regularly. If you don't like this film, I have to question your capacity to feel!!",1185667200,7,730,4.496240601503759
3232214,5,B000X1Z0BU,Just saw this movie and went straight to the store and bought the soundtrack. It is such an amazing movie and just shows that you don't need millions to make a wonderful movie (or Julia Roberts)! It really is an impressive production. It is only playing in our small Art House theater so I don't know if it is in wide release but it deserves to be.,1185580800,5,348,4.208955223880597
3232215,5,B000X1Z0BU,"'Once' is a movie miracle.  Drawing on the lives of two poor pedestrian people in Dublin, the film is a passionate and whimsical look at making music.  With genuinely good performances, a warm and witty script, and music that comes at you like a flowing stream, 'Once' is winning on every level.

'Once,' as in ""Once upon a time,"" he (Glen Hansard)(generically named a guy) meets a gal (Marketa Irglova) (similarly named) on the street.  He is a musician, belting out his own songs at an outdoor mall using a guitar with a gaping hole to accompany him.  At the beginning we find him chasing down a robber who's stolen his guitar case with all his change.  Such is his meager existence.  He hasn't quit his day job, either.  He works at a small, dirty vacuum repair shop when he's not making music.  She stops by him one day and is impressed.  (She throws in a dime, something he has the contumely to acknowledge a few times, yet he doesn't have the money to buy her magazine, either.)  She asks him pointed questions that put him on the spot, but her look and smile are so lovely that he's able to overcome the awkwardness, especially since she at first suits him as being someone she can leave her vacuum with where he performs.  (It's just quirky designs like this that make the movie so effective.)  He gets too forward at one point later, but he softens her interest to find that she, too, lives in a dingy apartment with her daughter, Ivana, who is just a toddler and her mother.  She is from the Czech Republic.  He falls in love, but both find the right notes musically.  She plays the piano and the keyboards, and her voice makes them a perfect match.  Remarkably, the powerfully felt music translates so well, and the purposely amateurish video clips of her show the streamlined fantasy she has become.  So focused is the series of home movies that (thankfully) stick out from MTV videos and makes the latter seem overwrought.  The music, the videos, and the movie sort of melt together into one story and song.  His passion inspires the music, but in every way she brings out the best in him.  Her passion also is in the music, but her inspiration is in many ways the same and different from his.

'Once' is truly a departure from other film fare.  At this point, I'll venture to wager it is one the best films of 2007.  After this experience, a good movie like 'Music and Lyrics' seems like a hollow confection in comparison.  (The vast majority of the songs' lyrics are credited to Glen Hansard with one by Maketa Irglova, and a few by familiar artists like Van Morrison--a perfect supplemental choice.)",1183680000,12,2615,4.536324786324786
3232216,5,B000X1Z0BU,"It is amazing how such a simple film can bring emotions from a depth that you never new existed within yourself. If only we all took the time to appreciate all of the simpler moments in our lives.
Truly a must see movie! If not for the story, then for the music. But mainly, for both. This is the only way I can ""review"" this film. I think each person needs to see it and experience it themselves.",1183334400,8,397,4.102564102564102
3232217,5,B000X1Z0BU,"I'm pretty darned old to fall for a movie like this one, but I think I could see it once a week and there would be healing in my life!  Seriously.  In many ways it is just a very long wonderful music video, but the authenticity of the relationship between love and the creative process blew me away.  I have very little extra money, but will probably see it at least a couple more times before the summer ends.  It is rated R because the street language uses the f word - sounds poetic on an Irish tongue.  If you have a young teenanger - sneak them in.  I guarantee seeing the movie will make your IPOD texting kid a better person.  And it will certainly work on you.",1183161600,13,668,4.131782945736434
3232218,4,B000X1Z0BU,"I doubt if I've seen a film more unabashedly romantic in the past five years, and this small-scale 2007 film is a musical to boot. Even with its Dublin-set working-class veneer, the story is basic boy-meets-girl formula, but director/screenwriter John Carney's real-world treatment manages to transcend the conventions, even if only fleetingly, through the aching pop ballads which make up most of the soundtrack and the sincerity of the two leads. The plot focuses on an Irish street musician who plays Van Morrison hits for change during the day but reverts to his original compositions at night. Written for a long-established girlfriend who has moved away to London, his open yearning and musicianship attract the persistent attention of a young Czech girl. Despite his initial hesitation, they bond quickly over his music. There is a lovely scene in a piano shop where he sings and plays his well-worn guitar to one of his songs, a stunning heartbreaker called ""Falling Slowly"", while she tentatively accompanies him on the piano. The story simply goes from one number to the next while uncovering facts about the characters that guide their fate.

It's been sixteen years since his memorable turn as guitarist Outspan Foster in Alan Parker's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Commitments/dp/B00018D3XW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Commitments</a>, but Glen Hansard, lead singer of the Irish rock group, the Frames, plays the forlorn busker with a searching intensity befitting a man not only broken-hearted from a fading long-distance relationship but also worried he will end up repairing vacuum cleaners just like his stoic father. Markta Irglov has the quirky, endearing quality necessary to play the girl. But as musicians whose compositions supply the soundtrack, their acting is secondary to the music they play. Hansard's deeply felt music immediately brings to mind Damien Rice's and David Gray's melancholy folk-rock ballads, while Irglov provides a nice complement with a voice similar to Bjrk's plaintive style. I have to admit the low-budget production values (it was made for just $150K) does make itself clear with some shaky, hand-held shots and overly grainy film stock. But all in all, if you are a fan of any of the musicians mentioned and remain undemanding in regard to cinematic storylines, chances are pretty good that you will enjoy this little film enormously.",1182643200,15,2437,5.498666666666667
3232219,4,B000X1Z0BU,"I decided to see this on a whim, not really knowing what it was about. It was just what I needed. As someone who has been going through a lot of stress lately and not really listening to music, it reminded me to bring the music back. If the songs were not good, there is no way that I would have made it through the film.

A man and a woman meet while he is playing guitar and singing in the street for money. She wants to hear more. He is a little jaded from his last relationship, but he can't help but like her. Later on, he finds out that she plays piano and they come together in the piano store to play a song together. That was my favorite song in the movie. I found myself glued to the screen, and then, my mind wandering, because it reminded me that I need to discover some new music.

Things don't always end in life they way they do in Hollywood movies (and I'm glad for that) but you still can't help dropping a few tears. So touching and beautiful. I will definitely buy the soundtrack.",1182556800,78,999,4.091836734693878

8226677,4,B000X1Z0BU,"SPOILERS FOLLOW:

My title pretty much sums up how I feel about this movie.  It just sort of moves along at its own pace and ends without a bang.  The only tension is will they or won't they.  And that just fizzles out too.  It's kind of a love story except the two lovers go their separate ways.  Still, there is a nice quality about the movie that I liked.  Maybe adding in the details I think were missing would just make it too conformist, too cookie cutter.  But I can't help but feel that something was missing.",1520812800,,517,4.204081632653061
