8336770,1,B001QWFTU2,"I must say when you read the back of the box and see it took 2 people to write the story,4 people to be producers, and another 4 to be executive producers and even 3 more people to compose the (non existing) music...and they ended up with a crock of s..t like this....the mind boggles!!! Made on a miniscule budget where everyone must have offered their services for free  A group of friends spend a weekend at an unused family house set in the back of beyond and the scene of an horrific multiple murder over 100 years ago when the place was used as the local school house and all the kids were butchered.  So far so good...then the rot sets in.... after encountering the local sheriff (Gary Busey,(what a comedown) one of the multiple producers and who took star billing over this cast of unknowns ) things go downhill rapidly.  The ""dead"" children start appearing and then one by one everyone starts dying  horrific deaths although they are mostly done off screen. For the rest of the film we are subjected to endless footage of teens running down roads, through woods,  here there and everywhere looking for each other to the point of utter boredom. The ending is also mystifing, as no explanation is really given  as to why what or who was in the woods (we did see a man (demon?) with large horns hovering over one of the films star studs.... but then he got shot by the sheriff... so if a bullit put paid to him what kind of undead was he? Watch it at your peril....you have been warned !!!",1242172800,4,1496,4.4021739130434785
