You will see how the native indians chew the Coco Leaf to overcome fatique and climb up into air thin altitudes to cultivate the fields of poppy which produce cocaine.

You will see first hand - how it is cultivated, grown, and harvested. Then you will see first hand how JUNGLE LABS prepare the cocaine for worldwide distribution.

Also, you will see how the South American government law enforcement and military enter, search for and destroy the jungle labs and the crops of the cocaine fields.

I remember seeing this particular program on TV back in the early 80's (not on cable) and now I have an actual video of the same program and use it to help young and old alike learn about cocaine and how it is cultivated in South America.

To purchase this video is money well spent. As far as I know, it is only available on VHS.",1327017600,,1009,4.4324324324324325

So many dramas have been made about cocaine coming from south of our borders. This is the real thing. Done with typical Jaques Cousteau efficiency of his oceanographic documentaries.  How compassionately and fairly Michel Cousteau depicted the politics in Colombia that leads to a pathetic solution to the war on drugs. How ghastly the U.S. demand keeps sending agents to their deaths.  This video should be shown in High Schools throughout the U.S. just to keep down demand and show the torture created by using cocaine as a ""pain alternative""...",1244764800,,661,5.111111111111111
