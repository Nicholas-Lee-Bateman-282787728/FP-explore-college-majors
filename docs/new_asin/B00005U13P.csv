7953971,1,B00005U13P,"The video picture was excellent.  However, the audio sound was very poor.  Everywhere there are ""background noises"" such as music or cars honking, etc...it is impossible to hear what the people speaking are saying.  If there aren't any added noises, and the only sound is people talking, then you can hear it just fine.  But if there is any other sound going on, then all you can is that sound.  There were several places in the movie, that I had absolutely no idea what was being said, usually outdoor scenes.  Unfortunately, I don't know how to read lips.  I suspect that when the movie was copied onto DVD it was not done correctly.  The vocal track is missing.  Overall, I had the feeling it was a good movie, I just wish I could have heard what Chad Everett was saying.  Would have been easier to follow the story.",1440028800,,819,4.472972972972973
7953972,2,B00005U13P,"I purchased this DVD to add to my collection of works with appearances by Chad Everett. This film is promoted as a mystery/crime drama, and appeared that it would have been quite a good movie had I actually been able to hear any of the DVD. I was very disappointed in the quality as the sound was like it had been filmed on the corner of Pitt St in Sydney. So loud was the background noise with traffic and blaring horns, that it was impossible to hear any of the dialogue in the movie. So disappointed.... I wasted no time in returning the item, and will continue my hunt for better copy.",1351468800,3,589,4.267857142857143
7953973,4,B00005U13P,"This crime drama is very good and the film has very good acting - also the conversations in some of the scenes are interesting and not the expected - the major plot twist - between the two women is not entirely predictable - I enjoyed being surprised. The leading man has a sense of integrity - which fits Mr. Everett, in my opinion. Everyone is beautiful in every scene - This is a good Saturday Afternoon film.",1347840000,,412,4.363636363636363
7953974,1,B00005U13P,"I loved this little movie when it was first shown on TV (it was called ""The Glitter Palace"" then) years ago and have always wanted a copy so when I saw this for sale I had to get it.  Nowhere in the details does it say that this is a COPY seemingly done by computer transfer program.  I received the movie on a DVD-R with the black labeling ink all smudged (not even laser sketched).  It was a worse copy than the VHS I had taped all those years ago (and has long since deteriorated).  I don't understand how it's even allowed to be sold so I am returning it with much disappointment.",1308960000,,584,4.1415929203539825
7953975,2,B00005U13P,"On the jacket, this film is promoted as a mystery/crime drama, in which a crusading attorney battles to clear the name of a woman unjustly accused of murder. While this element is certainly present, the film is prdominantly a plea for toleration of a lesbian life style. It comes out that the accused woman was being blackmailed by the murder victim because of her lesbian orientation, giving her a strong motive for the murder. During the process of his investigation, the attorney is challenged to come to terms with his own negative attitudes toward this lifestyle. In itself, this need not make for a bad film, but I felt that the issue was handled in too strident and preachy a fashion, with the attorney being regularly and often excessively berated by his former girlfriend,who is now the lover of the accused woman. This detracts too much time and attention from the mystery element of the plot, which consequently has to be resolved in a rather haphazard and unlikely manner.

  Acting and photography are competent. Film features supporting performances by two long established older stars, Howard Duff and David Wayne. In fact, the supportive relationship between older lawyer Wayne and his younger colleague Chad Everett reminded me somewhat of the old Ellery Queen TV series.",1195430400,2,1288,5.009345794392523
7953976,1,B00005U13P,"Considering the dvd-worthy titles out there awaiting digital transfer, I was a little surprised to find this 70s-era made-for-television movie in the $1 cut-out bin at a local used book store.
 A WOMAN ACCUSED is unwatchable (never thought I'd say that about a movie that has Anthony Zerbe in it.)  The problem is with the sound.  Background noises and music swamp the dialogue track - somebody walking across a room sounds like the French army storming the gates of Moscow.  A background violin drowns out whatever the actors are saying.  Not being a lip-reader I couldn't finish this movie.  If you're thinking about purchasing it, buy it from a reputable dealer that allows returns.",1088812800,12,685,4.964912280701754
