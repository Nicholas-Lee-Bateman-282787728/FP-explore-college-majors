8242252,1,B0011TM1QA,"I have several travel dvds of Norway, and I wanted this one because the name indicates it is about the train trip between Bergen and Oslo.  Most of it is about the sights in Bergen and Oslo, not about the train.  I was very disappointed.  I would not have ordered it had I known how little of the content was about the actual train trip.",1422057600,2,337,4.153846153846154
8242253,4,B0011TM1QA,"It is a great series, and I am tickler that Amazon puts them out there for the prime folks to view. I just noticed one of their cell phones from an episode and it looked to be the size of a brick. Just my observation. Still very cool scenery and the terrain has not changed im sure so it is good planning material for future vacation ideas",1389139200,,339,4.074626865671642
8242254,1,B0011TM1QA,"I'm irritated beyond belief.  I thought I was buying a copy of the video that I could send to a friend as a Christmas gift.  Instead, I'm told that I can now watch it as often as I like.  There was nothing I saw in the solicitation that said I was not buying a physical product.  If Amazon can't be a bit more clear about what it's selling, you're going to lose my business.",1386374400,,374,4.013513513513513
