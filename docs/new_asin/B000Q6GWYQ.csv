2832761,5,B000Q6GWYQ,"I really enjoy this DVD.  I watched a sea kayaking one on Amazon unlimited videos--and it was sooo boring.  Also the music in it was just annoying--changing from banjo to flute to opra--weird.  Anyway I was afraid this too would be corny--but it was not!  So, if you got turned off by the other one, I recommend this one.  It gives you different paddling techniques, it is pleasant, the sound is good, and it is overall a 5 star DVD.  I keep referring back to it as I am new at kayaking.",1311897600,,487,4.239130434782608
2832762,5,B000Q6GWYQ,"This DVD was great for me and my husband to watch when we were considering buying kayaks.  Once we did, we kept watching it to learn skills.  I'm not experienced enought to know what could have been missing, but for a newbie, it was perfect!",1310428800,2,241,4.333333333333333
2832763,5,B000Q6GWYQ,"I am just starting to get into kayaking and needed some guidance as to how to start out. I definitely had a fear of my kayak shooting off my car when I drive and as a beginner, fearing flipping over on a kayak. This dvd has helped give me the confidence to be able to get out there and do it.

They cover everything that you need to know if you are just starting out. As I said, I'm still new at this so I can't say much if it's good for intermediate or advanced levels of kayaking. This dvd covers from selecting the right kayak all the way to  recovery maneuvers. It has helped me properly load my kayak on the car so I no longer fear it flying off while driving. It teaches proper rowing and shifting weight to gain speed, turn on the kayak, and prevent flipping over.

Since I watched this dvd I have been able to enjoy kayaking so much more than before.

I highly recommend this if you are learning to kayak or just want to learn a few new tricks.",1281484800,9,952,4.074866310160428
2832764,4,B000Q6GWYQ,"This is great for an overview, but it does not replace actual live instruction for the type of kayaking intended.",1255046400,2,113,4.7
2832765,5,B000Q6GWYQ,"I bought two new kayaks for my son and myself from Dick's Sporting Goods.  We were both experienced in canoeing, but new to kayaking.  The DVD was perfect for us.  An experienced kayaker may find it too basic (but they may pick up a pointer or two, or learn some things to teach those new to the sport).  So, my five stars applies to newcomers only.",1221868800,11,349,4.242424242424242
2832766,5,B000Q6GWYQ,This DVD is a wonderful introduction to the world of kayaking.  I actually loaned it to some friends who were starting a kayaking group and haven't seen it since.  They tell me that they've watched it numerous times to make sure they understand the basics themselves before leading their group down the rivers.  They are also showing the video to the new members prior to hitting the water.  I guess I'll have to put it back on my wishlist since it's unlikely that it's going to be returned anytime soon!!,1218672000,16,505,4.5777777777777775
2832767,5,B000Q6GWYQ,"Bought my first kayak right before Memorial Day Weekend and purchased this video to learn the basics prior to going off on my maiden voyage with my toddler.  Perfect!  That's the best way to describe the information given in the video.  I was able to launch, turn, paddle backward, and knowing how to keep me and my kid safe.  BUY IT, if you're too impatient to wait for your local traiing course (although you should take that, too)!!!",1214179200,24,436,4.551282051282051

8194668,5,B000Q6GWYQ,"This is the DVD for paddlers, it has all the info you need to get started, and even polish your recreational kayaking.",1406246400,,118,4.409090909090909
8194669,5,B000Q6GWYQ,"This is a very good primer for beginners and for those of us who should have a refresher every few years.  My hope is that it might be made available for download from either the seller's website or Amazon.  I was not able to copy it into my hard-drive for archiving...may have been the copyright protection or my poor computer skills.
I really enjoyed this DVD.  I'll be ordering other titles but will wait a while to see if they are downloadable from the site.",1399507200,,462,4.411764705882353
8194670,4,B000Q6GWYQ,"This video is good, with a lot of information for beginner paddlers. I would recommend it to anyone considering buying a kayak.",1372291200,,127,4.818181818181818
8194671,5,B000Q6GWYQ,"before going kayaking or joining a club to ""get your feet wet "" this dvd will give you a good solid foundation to start with and
give you confidence so you  won't feel like a fish out of water. new to kayaking you owe it to yourself to have this dvd =go for it!",1369958400,,261,3.8333333333333335
8194672,5,B000Q6GWYQ,I thought the information in this dvd was great for a beginner paddler. Teaches you what you need to know to get out on the water feeling like you actually know what you're doing.,1368489600,,179,4.294117647058823
8194673,5,B000Q6GWYQ,"I'm entertaining the idea of my first kayak.  Knowing nothing about what to look for, what to expect on the water, or just what kind of fun there is to be had.  This DVD explained it all.  Very well done...",1323475200,,206,4.1
8194674,5,B000Q6GWYQ,"I want to begin this review by stating up front that I just took up kayaking this season (2011). I bought a kayak and started paddling but had no knowledge basis as to whether I was doing it right or wrong and how to get out of trouble if I got into trouble. I found this DVD a great source of basic knowledge of different paddling techniques, which I have taken to heart and employ. I also found their safety information quite useful especially recently when a friend, with whom I was kayaking, tipped over into the water. Now if you have years of experience with a kayak, are you going to get a lot out of this DVD? Probably not. But for someone with little to no experience, I would recommend it. Also I found the quality of the video and audio quite good. In addition, I found the demonstrations well done and easy to follow.",1317081600,5,829,4.286624203821656
8194675,4,B000Q6GWYQ,"The video quality is excellent and provides great info about the sport.  I think it is a better DVD choice over ""paddling the recreational kayak"".  It gives a little bit more info on the sport that other videos.  I would recommend this to anyone looking to get into this sport.",1314057600,,277,4.5
8194676,5,B000Q6GWYQ,"""Recreational Kayaking: The Essential Skills and Safety"" by Ken and Nicole Whiting is outstanding.  This is a very professional production that has been carefully edited and thought out.  Even the production values are great and the incidental music is easy to listen to!

There is literally no time wasted in this DVD.  It's tight.

The DVD is divided into a number of chapters including Choosing Equipment, Dressing for Kayaking, Transporting a Kayak, etc.  There are also subchapters, so within ""Before You Get Started"" you'll find ""Launching Your Kayak.""  Each of these are keyed to DVD chapter headings so by pressing the chapter key on your remote, you can go right where you want to go.

Each category is further subdivided.  For example, the ""Launching Your Kayak"" section shows launching from a dock, from sand, and from a rocky shore.  The techniques are explained and deomonstrated.  In the section on gear, some useful features of a PFD (personal flotation device, AKA ""lifejacket"") are discussed, and then the proper fit is demonstrated.

The DVD is made to be watched over and over.  There is not a lot repetition, but everything is done so well you can just rewind and repeat as needed.  Everything necessary to start kayaking is covered in this DVD, including various strokes and rescues, storing and transporting a kayak, kayaking activities, and most importantly how to stay safe on the water.

Most of the filming was done in some tropical locale, so just seeing that warm, turquoise water is relaxing.

I have watched this DVD a number of times and I have no serious gripes.  My minor gripe is that nearly everyone showed on the video is young and in shape.  I would like to have seen more out-of-shape middle-aged bald guys demonstrating some of the techniques--that would have been a confidence booster.  But this is really minor.  Even the Canadian accents didn't bother me.  Beauty, eh?

This is a great video if you are interested in kayaking, or would like to get your friends interested.  I can't praise it highly enough.",1313971200,4,2048,4.906705539358601
