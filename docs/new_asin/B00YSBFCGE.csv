7239597,3,B00YSBFCGE,"I have a TV but use it only to play DVDs  but by chance I turned it on earlier this year on a lonely Sunday night and caught what turned out to be the last episode of Season 6. It was good enough to motivate me to order Seasons 1-3 and now I have watched all six seasons. Btw, I paid $14.00 for a brand new Season 6 on Ebay, about half the current going Amazon price. The more one thinks about the show, the less satisfying it is. SPOILER ALERT: Plot details will be discussed.

Although it pretends to expose corrupt social maladies that run the gamut from NSA spying, DOJ open and flagrant destruction of exculpatory evidence, systemic electronic election rigging, to Chicagos Holman square as a black site, it does so from a post-modern post-moral perspective. None of the characters has a real moral center  the closest is Kalinda who trusts no-one but is fiercely loyal to friends and willing to sacrifice herself on their behalf  except the staunch filthy-rich right-wing conservatives who emerge as genuine champions of their own beliefs while the liberals seem to be defending a life-style and social identity. One clear example comes from Alicia Florrick when she is running for states attorney and says in a mock rehearsal that she was drawn to the law because of its clarity, because it gave clear rules about what was acceptable and what not, but not because it was just or because it was a way to help other people: the law was a way to organize her life. Eli Gold, her campaign manager, tells her not to push that view because it reveals too much selfishness.  (For some of the show's strengths, see my review of Season 2.)

As throughout, all the plot details collapse upon the slightest reflection. Season 6 begins with a frame-up of Cary Agos to force him to rat out his former client, drug-dealer Lemond Bishop. A CI (confidential informant) within Bishops crew, Trey Williams, has selectively recorded statements Agos made to the crew in response to hypothetical questions to make them appear to be answers to actual questions by the crew about how to avoid arrest (as though they need such help from Cary) as part of a heroin importation business they are planning. ASA Geneva Pine heads the prosecution (aided by ASA Finn Polmar who will soon join Carys firm after a tiff with his supervisor). The goal is to hold Cary without bail on a charge facing a 15-year minimum mandatory so that he will break and rat out Bishop. Detective Prima bitterly remarks that ASA Pine has ended her affair with him now that you no longer need me, implying that Pine knows of the frame-up, but everything else proceeds as though she did not. When Pine eventually apologizes to Cary who has suffered through genuine hell (in a great performance of inner collapse by Matt Czuchry), and with whom she had worked as fellow ASA for over a year, its as though apologizing to him for bumping into him in the hall. There is no depth of feeling because none of the characters has a sense of right or wrong except in a faint, vague, or trite way.

The case against Cary hardens so badly that he accepts a four-year plea bargain, but then in-house investigator Kalinda discovers that the drugs were being exported to Canada, not imported! So the cops lied about this and good-cop Rodriguez was taken off the case because he hesitated to lie and frame Cary. This is base plot contrivance to generate what counts as drama on the show  a chance to free Cary. But since Carys crime was telling the crew how to evade arrest in a drug scheme, there was no reason in the first place for the cops to lie that it was an import rather than an export of $1.3 million in heroin. The sole reason for this lie was to give Cary a way out, i.e., a fantasy-land contrivance.  Underscoring the moral nihilism that runs through this show, the reflective viewer must notice that the only difference between Cary being framed for a crime he did not commit and his having committed the crime is whether the exchange with the drug-dealing crew took place in the hypothetical tense, i.e., Cary was giving the advice that the cops framed him as having given: the cops don't give a damn whether or not Cary used the hypothetical tense while giving actual advice to actual drug dealers about how to avoid arrest.  If thats all the difference there is between legal and illegal, frame-up and fair play, what matters the law?

Unfortunately, before Kalinda found out which direction the drugs were flowing and the reluctance of Dt. Rodriguez to participate in the frame-up, she had decided to investigate whether Dt. Prima had read an email from a Canadian officer stating that this was an export scheme from Chicago to Toronto (because, otherwise, they wouldnt have known from their CI, huh?). If Prima knew and this were withheld from the defense, this would be a Brady violation and sufficient to undo Carys plea bargain.  To do this the Chicago Police Department (CPD) metadata file is given to Kalinda who has her tech guy show her how to change the metadata to make it appear falsely that Prima had read the email (to get a Brady violation). Now, of course, this only works if Kalinda has been given possession of the one-and-only original CPD metadata file, rather than a copy of it, something that would never be handed over. So again we are in fantasy-land. Kalinda fakes the metadata but decides not to use it because she uncovers Dt. Rodriguez. But senior partner Diane Lockhart discovers and  believing it genuine  uses the faked metadata to clear Cary along with testimony from Dt. Rodriguez. The CPD responds by hiring its own top notch investigator who proves that neither Prima nor Pine could have deleted the email at the moment that the metadata said it was deleted; hence someone else did  the person with access to the original metadata disc  Kalinda.

By now, fantasy land is all that we have. Diane Lockhart supposedly is in danger of disbarment and criminal prosecution even though Kalinda will swear that she alone knew that the metadata was faked because, according to Finn Polmar  who has joined the law firm after a tiff with his superior about how to proceed on a case  Diane has strict liability, a term from civil law regarding financial responsibility, not criminal responsibility, and also contrary to American Bar Association principles regarding grounds for disbarment. In other words, Diane Lockhart is in no real danger of either criminal prosecution or disbarment except by means of warping actual law and bar regulations to put her in such danger in order to create dramatic tension. But there is no dramatic tension for an intelligent viewer who understands basic issues of law and ABA regulations.

But it gets better, or worse. The crack CPD investigator speaks to Kalindas tech guru who in real life would not admit to knowing anything about changes on the metadata and gets him to admit that he fixed four traffic tickets for Kalinda by altering metadata even though he did not (and this would be an easy lie to expose because no such tickets had been issued). And when Kalinda tells the same story it is too similar to her gurus and the investigator tells her, Colombo style, that she is toast. But why anyone would admit to altering metadata on the original CPD disc (which they would never get) remains beyond belief since the gravity of that crime is the same whether it is a traffic ticket or Primas email.

And so the show goes, lurching drunkenly down the aisle, too often just a cut above soap-opera, from one impossibility or implausibility to another to generate a false and contrived dramatic scenario that most resembles a kind of improvisation audition where the facts may be invented to create a scene to see how well the actor can inhabit the moment. The typical tragic waste of talent and moral forum is made plainer by the contrast with occasional brilliant episodes like Blue Ribbon Panel that lay bare the institutionalized deceit of police civilian review boards consisting of eminent citizens (pastors, judges, lawyers, politicians, and businessmen) who meet wholly committed to the end of covering up police murders.  It is a shame that a show with such a talented writing crew and brilliant actors should squander its gifts on such shallow silliness.",1441584000,9,8279,4.726768377253814

7239604,3,B00YSBFCGE,"The ninth episode, Dark Money, written by another writer, not the usual ones, goes way beyond the limits of the typical boundaries of entertainment for this series. It is unrelievedly misogynistic, and, I believe, potentially traumatizing, for girls (especially) and women and  injurious to men and boys. There are two parallel stories with ghastly themes in which women are 1) repeatedly (by flashbacks) strangled (with the smiling strangler defending himself without much effective confrontation from anyone), and thete's a rich man, campaign donor, who is both meanly homophobic, but also uses rape language to attack Alicia Florick to another person. I am a longtime feminist and psychotherapist,  supposedly inurred by now to such tawdry images, but I found this whole episode, replete with such images, to be shocking in a series which doesn't usually indulge in women - hating porn. (Particularly when it's boring and contains no entertainment value!) [Note: It is produced by Juliana Margullies. Why produce meaningless trash?]

The series started off slowly, the first four episodes in which Carey Agos gets accused of a crime are boring. There is a curious overlay of flecks of situation comedy turns, particularly by a new lawyer, brought in by Diane, which is startling because it's such a departure from the usual style -- and, it doesn't work.

The murderous drug dealer, Bishop, figures throughout, in his intimidating way. What hold does he have over Kalinda? Why does she do his bidding, and call him sir all the time, even when he's been fired by her firm? Why does Alicia not protest when Bishop tells her he has set up and donated money to a PAC in her name? That's just beyond belief for a smart lawyer -- who's running for office.

Why, anyway,  does Alicia's firm even take on 'the biggest drug dealer in Chicago' as a client in the first place?

Alicia's 'body woman', assistant, Marissa, is handed weird lines; she is forever interrupting with a glass of milk for Alicia, who never wants one. (Why milk? She never explains.) It isn't her acting, I think, but the writing.

The Alan Cummings character has now yelled at Alicia consistently for several episodes. I am at #11. How can someone who is assistant to the governor be so uncontained?

The writing lacks pizzazz compared to former seasons. It goes up and down in interest.
It's disappointing. And annoying. Have the writers and producers gotten tired?",1440892800,8,2433,4.987654320987654

7239745,5,B00YSBFCGE,"I binge watched this season first on ondemand and then on DVD and they had me until the end of it. I hated the fact that the democratic convention wouldn't fight for her in the vote scandal and I hated how Diane and Cary treated her especially since Alicia was there for them in their times of need. I really would've liked to have seen, if Will was still alive and around how things would have been different even if it was just a dream sequence. I really am bummed that this was kalindas last season as well because I liked her character. I do however like the fact that since now Alicia is alone, she now is doing what she wants and not what her husband, partner, boss, love interest want. It'll be interesting to see in season 7 if she stays alone and her own boss, which I doubt, because she just doesn't seem built that way as a character. I'd like to see Cary, Diane, and her back together again although on her terms and not just because she is desperate to be around other lawyers. I liked the scene with grace and her and watching To Kill A Mockingbird and I liked the conversation that ensued about how she knew people who became lawyers because of that book/movie and their ideals and that they're usually prosecutors or somewhere else where it's not about money but about ideals and that she was not one of those people. I'm thinking that between that and graces crisis of faith, season 7 is going to be more about cases that have far reaching impacts and less about the big buck cases.

8718913,2,B00YSBFCGE,"Nothing wrong with the promptness of the delivery and the quality of the discs.  What I don't like is the left-ward shift in the story with guests like Valarie Jarret and that dishonest Donna Brazil who fed debate questions to crooked Hillary.  If the story continues in it liberal/progressive direction, I will lose interest in what has been truly a quality production up until session 5 and now 6.  Antonio",1492905600,,408,4.8
