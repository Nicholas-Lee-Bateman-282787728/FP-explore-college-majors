8314303,5,B001CQFNR6,"Love this movie. Packaging, video and sound all excellent. Keep in mind, this is a Region 2 disc with no English subtitles. I use the German ones. If you use VLC player to play the DVD, it can access an external subtitle file that you can find on the internet. The one I found was not very good, but it was useful in those sections where I couldn't understand the German.",1438214400,,371,4.23943661971831
