7896828,5,6305821569,"First off, I am a huge Trigun fan! This is one of my favorite anime's and I highly recomend it to anyone! Especially since the company has discontinued this product of the original DVD's. So, if you're a collector like me, then I highly recomend you get it while you still can!

I have ordered from MovieMars before and they have yet to dissapoint me! My product was delivered in a timly manner and in excelent condition! I will definatey order from them again in the future should they have what I'm looking for.",1245110400,,513,4.457446808510638
7896829,5,6305821569,This is a hilarious/ series type of gunslinging anime. If that does not float your boat this is not the anime for you. Straight up if you like a funny main character whom can be so down to earth you wonder if its the same dude. I give this anime two thumbs up.,1205020800,,260,3.9245283018867925
7896830,5,6305821569,"Having blazed a path of destruction everywhere he's gone, Vash the Stampede, the notorious gunman has finally met his match is Legato Bluesummers, a man who knows exactly how to get under Vash's skin and cause maximum pain.

Little Arcadia- Milly and Meryl become involved with a farmer trying to save his farm from ruthless land sharks. A bit of an aside from the main plot of the series, it's still a sweet episode about family ties and relationships.

Demon's Eye- This is where the series starts to take on the main plot line of Vash versus the Gung Ho Guns and Legato in particular. After crossing Legato's path again, Vash is horrified by the carnage Legato has left behind (he killed off an entire bandit gang in spectacular style). Finally meeting up with someone who cares as little about life as Vash values it, Vash is faced with another member of the Gung Ho Guns who seems able to teleport.

Fifth Moon- In the episode the series takes an entirely different tone becoming much more serious and Vash has to battle with himself and Legato. Faced with two more members of the Gung Ho Guns Vash is forced by Legato to use the Angel Arms, a weapon of mass destruction that is part of Vash and he seems unable to control, ending in Vash blowing a hole in one of the moons. Wolfwood is also back and shows a much more lethal side as we begin to question just who this priest is. There's a heartbreaking montage near the end where all the different people Vash has helped hear about his unleashing of the Angel Arms and how dangerous he is.

In this volume, the story of Vash and his friends takes a decidedly more serious angle as Vash deals with his own beliefs and fears as much as he deals with Legato. Pitted against an opponent who despises life as much as Vash values it, Vash is forced to face what he truly is and somehow protect those he cares about, even if that means getting them as far away from himself as possible.",1099267200,,1935,4.426966292134831
7896831,4,6305821569,"This one was a lot different that the ones before. It was a little more bloody plus a lot more language. I didn't care for that but over all it was still good. In this we see a new weapon that Vash has, but where did it come from?",1044057600,,230,3.7142857142857144
7896832,5,6305821569,"The cover of this DVD doesn't make much sense.  The art would have been much more appropriate for Vol. 1.  This is actually one of the darkest DVDs in the series yet.
First off, I'm really irritated at the dissing that the first episode, ""Little Arcadia"", gets.  This episode stars Milly and Meryl and Vash gets mostly left out.  This episode is very well done IMO.  Interesting story, hilarious villains, and rather touching at the same time.  It has a nice theme about family.  And I'm a big fan of the insurance girls.  Sure Vash is the center of the series, but Meryl and Milly really deserve much of the credit for making Trigun such an awesome series.
The next two episodes are kind of ""Villain of the Day"" affairs.  Thankfully this does not continue through Vol. 7.  In the second episode Vash confronts Dominique the Cyclops.  In the third, Rai-Dei the Blade.  And a very important event and revelation occurs in the third episode, so keep your eyes peeled.",987897600,2,965,4.6117647058823525
7896833,5,6305821569,"I had the opportunity to watch the entire show before it came to the US, and I've been slowly buying the subtitled DVDs as they are released by Pioneer here. This show is great, and it just gets better and better, although I admit that the series ending is rather weak. (Not much is really resolved and the end is left totally open.)
As for this DVD in particular, under Extra Stuff they finally put in a non-credit opening and ending option, for those of you who are into that sort of thing.
The first episode on this DVD is one of  my least favorites of the entire show. Vash has a minor role. Milly and Meryl are the main characters and they fight the 2nd half of the Nebraska Family.
The other two episodes however, are some of my favorites. Vash battles a few more of the Gung Ho Guns, Wolfwood has a hidden agenda, Vash reveals his other hidden gun, and all sorts of other cool stuff happens. For those first watching the episodes as they are released in the US, the show may look as though it begins to get very unoriginal and cliche. But just keep watching and be sure to get out the next DVD coming out. There is a sudden surprising twist in the series.",977961600,3,1162,4.257918552036199
7896834,3,6305821569,"I really liked the first 4 Trigun discs (even though 2-4 had only 3 episodes a piece). Despite the fact that Trigun was another ""wandering samurai looking for redemption anime"", it was a fresh and funny series. Volume 5 starts off really stale with a generic filler story that has no bearing on the overall picture. The next two episodes are better and advance the story but the series falls into another anime cliche, a battle with a series of villains to fight the ""big boss"". Damn shame, I had high hopes for this series.",977875200,2,524,4.526315789473684
7896835,5,6305821569,"Okay with this dvd you get 3 more episode of trigun, in these three episodes you get a better understanding of vash's past (not much but it does answer some question) and you also get to see vash's third gun ;), a couple of more members of the gung-ho gun are introduce and you get a better glimpse of legato's powers you also get to see a picture of milli and meryl and their true feelings for vash",975283200,2,399,4.128205128205129
7896836,4,6305821569,"The story of a wanted man known as Vash Stampede with a bounty of 60 billion double dollars, that's why every man would like a piece of him. This series is quite funny with some nasty villains and likeable characters. You might want to check this one out, the animation is great, lots of action and gags from Vash himself!",975110400,,322,4.383333333333334
