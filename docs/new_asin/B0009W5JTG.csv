2327150,5,B0009W5JTG,"My 3 daughters were thrilled to get this gift pack.  It has all of their favorite Barbie movies in it.  They love the music and the story lines, and the ""girl power"" found throughout every story.  I enjoy watching these videos with my girls, as there's something for each of them to enjoy (2, 4, and 6 yrs old).",1180396800,,311,4.237288135593221
2327151,5,B0009W5JTG,"My daughter just recently fell in love with Barbie movies, and this boxed set of the older ones was a great deal! The stories are all so cute and have good morals to them, I don't feel bad about letting her watch them. Very highly recommended!!!",1173571200,4,245,4.3478260869565215
2327152,5,B0009W5JTG,"WHOLESOME.  Strongly recommended.

Gets the stamp of approval as most compelling watch over Sponge Bob seasons on DVD, all the Disney movies, etc, by my daughter when she was in the 3 to 5 years old range.  Very pure, clean, straight-forward, no negativity, politics, sex, and no bad attitude, words, behaviors like most modern cartoons.  Evil mouse King not too scary.  Adults will appreciate it as excellent for children, a good watch even for adults.  Appears to be created with video game creation software and rendered with video game engine, not poor quality, just that the models of all physical items rendered in the movie look like video game engine output, hair does not look photo realistic in its movements, but that is not at all important to a child's eye and not distracting to an adult's eye.

Contrasts with Disney movies, where someone always dies or is orphaned at the beginning, and with their cheap shot one-way captive audience liberal political messages and put-downs of alternative view points.  These Barbie movies do not contain political messages.  Some suggest that Barbie is a political message.  Incorrect.  Barbie is an icon.",1168819200,,1156,5.031578947368421
2327153,5,B0009W5JTG,"I have 2 young girls, and they LOVE all 4 of these movies.  All the movies have a good story, with strong and beautiful heroines that girls can look up to; they also contain lots of beautiful classical music.",1168560000,,208,4.333333333333333
2327154,5,B0009W5JTG,"This has the first four Barbie movies in one, they are Nutcracker, Rapunzel, Swan Lake, and the best one ever - The Princess and the Pauper. It is a good mix of Barbie singing and dancing. The quality of the animation and the storys get better as they go on with the Princess and the pauper songs etc the best. There is some great humour in that one too which the kids really enjoy.

Hours of fun in here which will keep your little girl occupied. Also nice dancing in the first two (Nutcracker and Swan Lake). What I like about these movies is Barbie is very capable, she is intelligent and tries to help others. I know it probably sounds trite, but I like the fact that the movies teach good ethics to kids, about being part of a community, and respecting others.",1160006400,51,765,4.3125
2327155,5,B0009W5JTG,My three year old daughter loves these movies.  My five year old son also watches them.  We got them about 2 months ago and only just this week have they watched something other than these movies.,1131062400,7,196,4.416666666666667
2327156,5,B0009W5JTG,My 2 and 5 year old daughters have enjoyed this set immensely.  A great value for the money too.,1129420800,6,96,4.052631578947368
2327157,5,B0009W5JTG,"My 5-year old daughter and I both love all four of these movies as well as Fairytopia.  We are both very much looking forward to Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus.  The Barbie movies have much milder villians and aren't nearly as scary as most Disney classics.  The scenery is beautiful and they have great classical music.  A pure pleasure to watch...over and over again.

I definitely recommend these for mother/young daughter viewing.",1126396800,19,435,4.904109589041096
2327158,5,B0009W5JTG,"I am definitely not a barbie fan, but my four year old daughter is. She has developed a love of ballet, classical music and femininity from watching the barbie movies. Morales of being honest, friendly to all, unselfish, caring, hardworking, modest etc. are touched on throughout the movie and open the way to talk about some issues with my daughter on her level of understanding.

I would highly recommend all of the Barbie movies for moms and daughters to sit together and have some fun girl time. It's not often that a movie will come along that's entertaining to both child and adult - that is wholesome without any adult innuendos or humor.",1125619200,38,645,4.707964601769912
2327159,5,B0009W5JTG,"We purchased this as a Christmas gift for our 6 year old granddaughter. There are 4 Barbie movies in this set. They are Rapunzel,Swan Lake,The Nutcracker and The Princess and the Pauper. Kiersten especially liked The Nutcracker and Swan Lake(which may be because she is in her second year of dance classes which she really enjoys)We bought this from Amazon for $17.99 which averages about $4.50 per movie. However,Amazon has since raised the price to $24.99 in just a few weeks time.",1262476800,,483,4.902439024390244
2327160,3,B0009W5JTG,"our girls loved the twelve princes so much we decided to try this set.  unfortunately, most were too scary for our little girls (2 & 4).  some of the scary things for kids are just a bit much for little ones while some are more evil in nature (wizard, witch, etc.).  might consider caution if you'd prefer to avoid these things).",1255478400,,329,4.360655737704918
2327161,5,B0009W5JTG,This movie arrived in quick time and in great condition.  Our little 4 year old was very pleased.,1238284800,,97,4.388888888888889
2327162,5,B0009W5JTG,This was a great deal for all four movies.  My daughters love each one.,1233100800,,71,4.071428571428571
2327163,5,B0009W5JTG,"I purchased this movie set for my daughter, she is 4 years old. The movies, while being girlie, still have some adventure and teach lessons. lots of music and dancing, we love them!",1231804800,,181,4.515151515151516
2327164,5,B0009W5JTG,"This was on my list of stuff to get our daughter. Glad I didn't get it before today because I found it at Safeway for only $10 (yes, new). It didn't come with the bonus activity dvd, but that's ok. Four movies for $10 is a great deal, even at Amazon's price it's a good deal I guess. She's only seen one so far (Swan Lake) but loved it and was grumpy when she had to wait until tomorrow to watch another one. The animation is nothing special, but for an almost-3 year old it will do. The music I think is from the ballet (someone more knowledgeable than myself has probably already commented on that topic). Anyway, for a toddler-preschooler it's entertaining.",1231632000,,660,4.373983739837398
2327165,5,B0009W5JTG,"This is an excellent collection (Nutcracker, Rapunzel, Swan Lake and The Princess and the Pauper). My 5 years old daughter absolutely loves these. She started getting into ballet because of it :).

I must say that these are great movies for quality time spent together by the entire family. They don't just have entertaining value but also educational value by exposing the kids (and adults too :)) to classical works and excellent music in fun way. They are based on some great classic works and the movies are very well produced.

The value for the money is unquestionable great too and Amazon is definitely the place to get it; you just cannot go wrong with this as a gift or for any other reason!",1229904000,2,700,4.637096774193548
2327166,4,B0009W5JTG,"The delivery was great, but no fault of the seller, one of the DVD's didn't work properly and I was disappointed as I didn't know how to get a new one since it was in a set.
My Grandkids enjoyed the other three.",1229904000,,211,3.9302325581395348

2327169,5,B0009W5JTG,"These movies capture my 5 yo grandaughters attention and hold it - she loves the music and HAS to dance to it. The story lines are excellent, but the classical style music and songs are really suprising. Great girls movies that I don't mind watching with her!",1219104000,,259,4.531914893617022

2327171,5,B0009W5JTG,"I bought these 4 movies for my daughter yesterday and we watched them ALL.
My 3 year old loves them and I was very and pleasantly impressed. My little one has been asking for the Mariposia one, and I thought, let's checkout these other ones first. I was glad I did and I want more. I want them for her and I love them myself. Over the years, I have shyed away from Barbie was not going to let her even play with them, as I felt there were getting "" a little too grown up"" But when I saw these movies, I fell in love all over again. The movies are beautiful. Everything from the scenery to the music, just so wonderful to watch. You will want to see it over and over again.

In these movies, Barbie is depicted as a strong sensible, sweet, kind person with values. She is the one who tries to make the difference and not the damsel in distress. She is not about self image and selfish... Lessons are taught in a gentle way and I must admit, being a die hard Disney fan, they were milder and slightly less intense. I loved these even more and so did my daughter. She has never asked to see anything over and over more so soon.

She loves being a princess and she loves to dance ballet. Now she wants to be a barbie princess. She takes ballet and she loves classical, so this was a good mix for her.

Watch them with your little girl and you will enjoy it. For the dad's, the animation is much like that of XBOX 360 and Playstation. Very nicely done Barbie.

It will be my pleasure to get more of them...",1205798400,2,1501,4.095238095238095

2327174,5,B0009W5JTG,We had a couple of the Barbie movies before purchasing this set and my daughter had watched those so many times she just about had it memorized.  So we decided to add to her enjoyment with this 4 disk set and it was way worth it!!! It is a great value and the movies keep her excited when it's movie-time.,1199577600,,305,4.083333333333333
2327175,5,B0009W5JTG,"It is nice having them all in one box set. My daughter's received these for Christmas, but just between you and me, I wanted them too. I love how Barbie is brave and spunky and not just a damsel in distress (no names mentioned... Snow White).",1198972800,,242,4.282608695652174
2327176,5,B0009W5JTG,"My daughters, ages 2 and 4, borrowed the Barbie Nutcracker, Swan Lake and Rupunzel DVDs from our neighbors and they watched them over and over again.  I knew that I would not be wasting any money on purchasing the movies for them.  I saw the Barbie Movie Collection and purchased the set last month. The novelty has not worn off.  The Princess and the Pauper movie has become my two year old's favorite and we have the music CD in the car.  My girls also asked for the music for the Nutcracker.  I ordered a CD online and we dance around the house to it.  The girls are also suprised to hear the music on the television or radio.  They recognize the music and can name the movie it came from.  This cannot be a bad thing.",1196726400,,721,4.211678832116788

I don't know if anyone else has noticed, but the Barbie movies have stronger male roles than then the Disney movies - especially the early Disney movies. It's nice for them to have positive role models who are not in movies that involve perpetual violence. My grandson really enjoys these movies!
