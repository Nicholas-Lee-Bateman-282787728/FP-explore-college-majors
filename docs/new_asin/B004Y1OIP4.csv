8447837,5,B004Y1OIP4,"A superb little coming-of-age drama with no pretensions but beautiful aims. Love like Poison(from a Serge Gainsborough song)has terrific newcomer Clara Augarde as Anna,who has returned from boarding school to stay with her ailing grandfather(Michel Galabru),along with her mother,Jeannette(Lio),who is divorcing her father. Portraying Anna,Clara is remarkably assured physically,yet retains a face of innocence and adolescent vulnerability. Anna is undergoing a crisis of faith with her upcoming confirmation,brought on by her own burgeoning sexuality and her feelings for local boy Pierre(Leboulanger-Bouvril).Tensions in the house reach boiling point when her father comes to visit. Jeanette finds herself drawn towards local priest Francois(Cassetti),who she knew as a child. On top of this Anna's mother is in conflict with her daughter,who's budding body will give her a power to attract her mother's life is losing,and will always have her father's love.

The intelligent script takes an intriguing approach to the story, refusing to spell out everything that's going on and allowing us to fill in the gaps for ourselves, through glances, body language and what feels like a series of vignettes rather than a straightforward, dialogue-heavy narrative. Anna'a problems with religion are summed up by a terrifying bishop who starkly separates the body and the spirit in his sermon,which explodes in the minefield of her own sexuality,ancient Catholic and small town repression against her blossoming youth. Beautiful photography, eclectic soundtrack(mostly English folk songs and a song by Radiohead sung by a female choir).Her grandfather and Pierre appear to be atheistic in temperament which suits her hormones more,these two being the anchorage of her life. A beautifully directed, superbly written and brilliantly acted coming-of-age drama that marks cowriter/ director Quillevere out as a talent to watch.",1324857600,3,1915,5.790780141843972
