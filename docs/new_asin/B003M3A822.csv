8400066,5,B003M3A822,The O'Toole/Hepburn is lots of fun.  An early score by John Williams is perfect.  The clothes are still wonderful.,1447027200,,114,4.947368421052632

8400068,5,B003M3A822,All the films in this box are enjoyable to watch. They are funny. The acting by theses wonderful actors is great. The stories are well written. I especially love Desk Set with Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. The other one that was really funny was How to Steal a Million with Audrey Hepburn and Peter O'Toole. They make an attractive couple and very funny. Hollywood Cavalcade has a nice insight to the time when silent films transitioned to talking. It's nice to see Alice Faye and Don Ameche. it even features Buster Keaton. Plus who can not enjoy Cary Grant and in I was a Male war Bride he is funny.,1421452800,,608,4.486486486486487

8400070,4,B003M3A822,"I bought this for ""How to Steal a Million"", which I knew would be lots of fun.  ""Desk Set"" is a classic Hepburn/Tracy movie, so I was delighted to get that too.  ""I was a Male War Bride"" was entertaining, though not of the same caliber.  ""Hollywood Cavalcade"" is a warm love story, with a nice story about friendship mixed in, but without the laughs of and sparks of the first two.",1397692800,4,381,4.263888888888889
