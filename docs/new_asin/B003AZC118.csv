8393311,5,B003AZC118,"Back in 1984 a role reversal comedy, Who's The Boss? went to air in the USA starring Tony Danza, Judith Light and Katherine Helmond and ran for nearly 200 episodes over eight years.
In 1990, Central Television made 13 episodes of The Upper Hand using scripts from the US version. The layout of the hosue is exactly the same as in the US version and the characters could not be any more similar either. With a first class cast in The Upper Hand including Joe McGann, Honor Blackman and Diana Weston, ther programme would run for a further six series. The comedy in this set is fantastic and it's just a shame that this sort of thing isn't amde anymore.
