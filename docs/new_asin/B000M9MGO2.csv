1. We paid for  in October 2008 and it took us being lied to by Pixfusion (the makers of the DVD) several times about shipping dates plus numerous phone calls before we finnaly got the DVD, just days before Christmas.
2. It is now March 5 2009 and we still haven't recieved the picture we sent in to make the video back yet. Again more phone calls,more lying about shipping dates. And now, today, they tell me they ""just have too many to ship and they are TAKING A BREAK FROM SENDING BACK PICS until April 1st!!!!!!
That means that in total (so far) we have been messing with this one item for Six Months!
The product itself is good enough but there is now way I would have ever bought one if I had known what a hassel we were in for.",1236211200,16,825,4.15625
