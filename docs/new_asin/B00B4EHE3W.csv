8562227,5,B00B4EHE3W,"Really good, gives you key points for each pose, shows poses from different directions, explains clearly how to balance. I've made great progress with this DVD on arm balances with which I had trouble with an actual private instructor. If you need a DVD which will explain to you in detail how to do a certain pose, this is a really good one. Sound biomechanics and good explanations, and without weird instructions that you can find in some youtube and other yoga videos (melt your heart (one of the youtube ones), connect with your left kidney (that's shiva rhea, lol), etc.)",1367625600,3,577,4.7227722772277225
