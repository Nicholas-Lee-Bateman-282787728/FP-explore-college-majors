1617933,5,B00005KA74,I REALLY LOVED THIS MOVIE VERY MUCH. I AM INTO HISTORICAL MOVIES A LOT. I LIKE GREGORY HINES AND JAMES BELUSHI AS GREAT ACTORS.,1350518400,,127,4.333333333333333
1617934,3,B00005KA74,"I have purchased this film for instructional purposes only.  I am a Forensic Science teacher at a local high school and my students write a 10 page APA format research paper on a suspicious murder, unresolved murder, serial killers, and or debatable suicides. Therefore I purchase films having to do with these subjects because a film is substitute for a book reference.",1279843200,,370,4.967741935483871
1617935,4,B00005KA74,"This movie is pretty great. It takes place a few years after The Atlanta Child Murders case was ""solved"" and goes into a secret investigation of the KKK's connection to the case. The main characters are a reporter and a magazine editor who initially were just looking for a story and ended up finding a lot more than they bargained for.
The movie is based off the article in the September 1986 edition of SPIN magazine.
The DVD was delivered in a timely fashion, and I was very satisfied with it.",1271203200,3,496,4.461538461538462
1617936,5,B00005KA74,In the early 1980's there was someone killing the children of Atlanta. Eventually a single man was caught and convicted in one of the largest manhunts in our nation's history. Ever since the case has been closed until four years later two reporters investigate charges that the original investigation was filled with errors and tainted evidence. They seek to find the truth behind the Atlanta Child Murders. This movie is incredible. It tells the true story of two reporters as they try to uncover a conspiracy concerning the murders of young African American children from poverty-stricken areas of Atlanta.  The actors are superb but yet manage to keep you focused on the heart-wrenching story of innocence lost without letting you stray from the point at hand.,1265760000,5,763,5.055555555555555
1617937,1,B00005KA74,"The movie fails to advance its theory that Wayne Williams was not responsible for the murders. In fact, the producers are only interested in ignoring facts in favor of any scenario, no matter how improbable,  that absolves Williams as the sole person responsible for the crimes. Since the arrest of Williams, the murders stopped. Why would this sci-fi flick want to address that fact? But those who get a kick out of mediocre acting and conspiracy woo should find it to their taste.",1241049600,4,482,4.807228915662651
7942908,3,B00005KA74,"plot: 2 reporters from Spin Magazine find new clues to the Atlanta Child Murders.

Gregory Hines and Jim Beluchi are two reporters from Spin Magazine that head to Atlanta several years after a man was arrested and convicted of the murders of black children. They make every attempt to gain old info from the special Georgia Task Force  but get no where fast. The murders were investigated by the FBI, Georgia Task Force and Atlanta PD. Hines and Beluchi find a bag outside their door of *confidential* police files about the murders which clearly point to a white supremacist angle. All trails lead to a retired detective who made copies of his paperwork and buried it. All other files were destroyed immediately after the murder case was closed. This is a very interesting but confusing meandering plot. Hines and Beluchi are excellent as the two bickering reporters who do not agee on what path to take to get more information. The end leaves us with many possible conclusions. Spin Magazine did print a major article based on the findings of their reporters. Even the fine acting could not keep up with the confusion of the plot. I give it 3 stars for a new angle on the child murders and good acting by Hines and Beluchi.  The Atlanta Child Murders were given this  named this after the 1979-1981 murders of 29 black children found murdered around Atlanta Georgia.",1505606400,,1368,4.735294117647059

7942912,1,B00005KA74,"Echo of Murder is pure junk. Not worth the time it took to watch. At the end of the story nothing of this movie became anything or change anything.
I would really like to know more about this Atlanta child murders but is not it. BAD BAD",1420761600,,236,4.042553191489362
7942913,4,B00005KA74,Did they get it wrong back in the day. At least there are serious doubt after seeing this. Good acting as well.,1401753600,,111,4.090909090909091
7942914,1,B00005KA74,The DVD was a foreign copy that does not play on USA machines. A total waist of my money. Amazon should not sell such merchandise.,1400371200,,130,4.24
7942915,2,B00005KA74,"I've read quite a few books now from John Douglas, former profiler for the F.B.I.  Not that I like to put words in anyone's mouth, but if he were to watch this film -- most likely he gave it a shot and then just gave up would be my guess -- he would most likely say, ""Phooey!""  Yes, you might say, ""Well, he's just biased,"" and you might have a point.  But that point wouldn't be a good one.

In at least one of his books, Mr. Douglas discusses this case specifically.  From what I remember, he believed that Wayne Williams was probably guilty.  If Mr. Williams is a murderer -- he was tried and convicted, but some of the evidence I'll agree was on the lean side in this case -- he perhaps didn't kill all of the children.  Maybe he killed none of them.  But even if he wasn't guilty of this set of crimes, there was somebody out there that was LIKE Mr. Williams that did.

After all, if you read ""Mind Hunter"" -- a very good read in which I gave a big recommendation -- you'll learn quite a bit about serial killers and profiling.  Outside of the killers of prostitutes, it is almost always the case that serial killers choose victims in their same race.  (As an example, Gary Ridgeway killed prostitutes from any race.  He was an equal-opportunity killer.)  And it's almost always the case as well that those killers choose victims who are of the sex in which the killer is attracted.  And outside of killers such as Aileen Wournos, there are very few serial killers who are women.  (Most female serial killers tend to poison their victims.  Why?  Maybe 'cause it's neater.  Who knows?  Any female serial killers out there that would care to respond?)

So, if you play the averages, the most likely scenario:  the killer was a black man who probably had at least gay and pedophilic tendencies, who was in the correct age range to take advantage of those tendencies.  And this points directly at someone who is at least LIKE Mr. Williams.  But this film introduces some conspiracy theories that are just eye-rollingly ridiculous.  Using Occam's Razor, it is much more likely that some random serial killer murdered the children than some group of people who had to all keep their mouths shut.  Once again, this points to someone LIKE Mr. Williams.

I believe that the writer and director of this film tried to create a picture somewhat like ""All the President's Men,"" and to tell you the truth, I even hate saying ""All the President's Men"" and ""Echo of Murder"" in the same sentence.  That sentence would be highly demeaning to a great film such as that near-perfect Robert Redford film.  But this film also reminded me of ""JFK,"" although I found that film at least mildly entertaining, even though it was full of conspiracy theories as well, most likely since Kevin Costner was the better lead in that better film.

This film is really heavy handed but really light on logic.  There is music that plays with your emotion, and it seems that everyone in it uses logical fallacies such as ""appeal to emotion.""  For these reasons I'm giving ""Echo"" a really big pass.  Go read a book instead; may I recommend ""Mind Hunter""?",1383696000,,3120,4.53584229390681
