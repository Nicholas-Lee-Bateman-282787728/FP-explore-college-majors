8584066,1,B00COQQ3D6,this movie totally stinks! My 5 year old could do better if I allowed it but no way! I could write a better movie then this! No stars on this one! I want a refund!,1471737600,,163,3.6857142857142855
8584067,1,B00COQQ3D6,"Bad, just bad. Terrible acting, film quality and plot line.",1464480000,,59,5.0
8584068,1,B00COQQ3D6,"I honestly believe that a 9 year old kid wrote this movie. The damn music playing in the background never stops!! It's constantly playing! Loud as hell too! Most of the time you can't even understand the dialogue, unless you really turn up the volume crazy loud! The director of this film should never be aloud to work on a movie, EVER AGAIN!! This douchebag director is king of the close ups too! I mean, any closer to the actors faces and they would steam up the lense! This flick isn't even a funny bad film. It makes no sense, you solve it within the opening minute and the actors aren't even porn worthy. AVOID THIS PIECE OF TRASH!",1453248000,2,636,4.352941176470588
8584069,5,B00COQQ3D6,"The actors definitely played well with each other, for the most part. But the sick and twisted energy that was captured on high definition between them was also due in part to the amazing work of director Dr. Maximus Nikoff. Great acting throughout the movie. The editing was hit and miss. I'd say that the movie needs to have a Director's Cut edition cut from the original elements. I'd bet that if you handed the camera footage to a certain 1/2 Korean madman, he'd make outright magic from the catacombs of Legend Has It.

Thank you, Dr..",1445817600,,540,4.56701030927835
8584070,1,B00COQQ3D6,After the first ten minutes i cut it off...& i normally give even bad movies a chance but this one omg...lets just put it this way...im not a filmmaker of any sorts & i could have done a better job than they did on this one...just don't waste your time or money.,1437177600,5,262,4.0576923076923075
8584071,2,B00COQQ3D6,"It's a shame because the movie had decent acting , you get some skin (albeit sex scene in their underwear) but that's really about it. A lame story about a slacker film student shooting in a house where (in 1976) a family is slaughtered and the filmmaker is trying to find out why. I bought the film because on eBay a seller described it as a bigfoot movie (it's not) by looking at the cover and seeing the movie, it's misleading (especially when you see the monster - a guy in a slightly better than bottom basement movie hairy mask.)

The monster kills the crew (who move incredibly slow) and some inept cops (the sheriff standing there waiting for his machete chop is incredibly awkward) and some shots suffer from lighting continuity issues. One of the lamest scenes (the climax) simply has the main star screaming as he accidentally kills his girlfriend..... and the monster does what to him, he runs, he gets killed, he ....WHAT? You don't know because the sheriff shoots the monster (then dies) and then the monster gets up (hopefully NOT setting up a sequel) and THEN it ends.

The DVD extras are bad. Especially the ""alternate ending"" which simply shows the credits with different images in the background. I thought an alternate ending showed something different happening (like a coherent ending.) Not a good movie and there are a lot better things you can do with 90 minutes of your time.",1397260800,6,1400,4.686991869918699
8584072,1,B00COQQ3D6,When I received this movie I could not wait to watch it. The name and the box cover look like it was going to be good. Was I wrong this movie is one of the worst I ever seen it look like it was filmed in a back yard. I could not even finish watching it. Save you money if there was nothing to watch on T.V go outside and do something else. This is how bad this movie was.,1375574400,7,371,3.65
