7821852,1,6302157560,"This is the same movie, albeit not as good technical quality, as Empire of Passion.  Do nbot make the same mistake I did, thinking this was The Realm of the Senses.",1331078400,,164,4.290322580645161
7821853,4,6302157560,I love Japanese horror films.  This one is creepy and has strong sexual content. I liked the movie but the end wasn't that great.,1283990400,,129,4.375
7821854,4,6302157560,"At last, Oshima's movies were produced on DVD with reliable info on English subtitles: all the previous stuff just combined Japanese, French and Chinese wording, misleadingly mentioning a range of language options available.

Beautiful cast acting convincingly adds to positive comprehension of this ordinary melodrama.",1210723200,,1256,7.537414965986395
7821855,1,6302157560,"Completely unwatchable drivel. In the Realm of Senses pushed the envelope with its sexual themes and graphic depictions of sexual acts. In the Realm of Passion seems to want to capitalize on that, but it fails miserably. No real plot (some sort of insanity and a ghost story of some kind), sex, and nothing interesting or engaging at all here. Do not bother with this.",985564800,,368,4.676923076923077
7821856,3,6302157560,"This film contains so much violence, paranoia, and  madness.  The story is kinda slow, but the ending  is quite heart-shaking and depressing.  The cinematography is almost like film noir.",917481600,,187,5.344827586206897
