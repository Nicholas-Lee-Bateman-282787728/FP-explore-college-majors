5448040,5,B00AKK6MD4,"I had waited so long on Warner to bring out the second season of this series that I had given up.  I'm very glad they finally decided to listen to the fans and do a second season.  The second season (and season 3 and 4) are much better than season 1.  If you are a superman fan (especially of the late seventies version of superman) I think you will like this series.  It is NOT dark, it is NOT outstanding special effects, but it IS a very enjoyable story and fun to watch.

Oh and contrary to another viewer's review these discs ARE DVRs (which you can plainly see by looking at the surface of the discs), but they are well done and look very much like factory-made DVDs based on the design and quality of the artwork.  I had no problems playing these discs on my Blu-ray player.  Warner, please don't make us wait years to bring out the final two seasons of this great series.  Highly recommended.",1356480000,16,900,4.284023668639053
5448041,5,B00AKK6MD4,"I really miss this series, I know it sounds a bit corny, but I do miss it.  It is dated, but still a lot of fun.",1356393600,,112,3.3076923076923075
5448042,5,B00AKK6MD4,"Those of you who were disenchanted with this groundbreaking series, I ask you to please give it a second chance. This second season began new changes which completely took the series in a new direction to become one of the very best incarnations of 'Superman' ever put to film.
When executive producer Ilya Salkind created this series originally it was set at Schuster university. The first season was cheesy and the special effects had much to be desired. The show was in danger of cancellation by the end of the first season so drastic measures were taken to save the show. What they did was genius.
Gone was John Haymes Newton as the lead role replaced by Gerard Christopher. Gone was the poorly casted Scott Wells and replaced by the most noticeable and greatest cast change Sherman Howard who now played a truly sinister Lex Luthor who was inspired by the great Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the Joker in the first Batman movie which, at the time, was still fresh in people's minds. Beautiful Stacy Haiduk still played Lana Lang. Gone also was TJ White replaced by Andy McAlister.
This season looks like a completely different show that included foes taken directly from the comic book pages of Superman magazines such as Bizarro and Metallo. The stories were much more written as true Superman stories. As the series progressed further in this season we have effects that rival the Christopher Reeve films, particularly the dismal ""Superman 4"" which had no budget for flying scenes. Although the series was about SuperBOY, it definitely was written as SuperMAN stories. In my own opinion it was much better written than the later series ""Lois & Clark"" which replaced it.(On a side note, Christopher was actually cast as Clark Kent for ""Lois and Clark"" until it was discovered that he played Superboy in this series which caused him to be kicked off the show and replaced by Dean Cain).
The special effects had vastly improved, the stories much more interesting and suspenseful, and the new cast change brought the series to a new ratings high and it was one of the very few series which actually improved with each season!
In the early episodes of the second season Christopher played a nerdy Clark Kent, much like Reeve in the films which preceeded the show. But soon Clark's personality changed to a 'straighter' interpretation of Kent much more like George Reeves played in the ""Adventures of Superman"" series from the 1950s. This was also a nice and noticeable change in the show.
If you are a Superman fan, PLEASE give this show a second look. It will be worth it, especially if you are not familiar with it. You should be surprised at the big changes which made the first season look almost disasterous. Once you watch this season, unlike the first season, you will very likely be asking for more stories. Believe me, the stories get even better in the third and fourth seasons when the setting moves to the Bureau for Extra-Normal matters. Luthor becomes even more prominent in later stories and shows his sinister intentions,MUCH more like the Lex we have come to know and love (sort of). Please.....GIVE IT A SECOND CHANCE! You won't be sorry.",1356134400,27,3158,4.796330275229358
5448043,4,B00AKK6MD4,"Since this series was never syndicated, finding ways of watching it were tough to say the least.  The first season was all we had available on DVD, but that was probably the weakest of all of them.

Sherman Howard makes a welcome change as the new Lex Luthor.  His origin of becoming Lex Luthor is a little whacky, and conveniently never referred to again, but he makes a great villain nonetheless.  Gerard Christopher taking over the title character is a little awkward if you've just come off of the first season, but he grows into the role nicely as the series progresses.  And the stories begin to mature here, as well.  They're not as dark in tone was the 3rd and 4th seasons, but they're definitely less campy than the 1st season.

As far as the DVD itself, first of all, I was surprised to find that these are NOT DVD-R's as their description says.  These are regular old, factory-pressed DVDs.  The audio and picture are greatly improved from the first season, too.  You can tell that the episodes are still transferred from the old videotape masters like the 1st season, but the picture is sharpened and the colors look a lot brighter.

And yes, these stories are a little campy, but they can also be a little dark at times.  Nostalgia does play a big factor here, but these are just plain, enjoyable stories to watch.  I'm really hoping they release the next two seasons.",1355702400,17,1381,4.565040650406504

5448048,5,B00AKK6MD4,"I loved this new imagining of the Superboy series. We now have a new actor playing Superboy, and he has a very annoying roommate (though not as annoying a character as Jar Jar Binks was in Star Wars).

They also found a unique way to change actors for Lex Luthor, a logical way to use an older actor who looks totally different, bringing him back from death.

If you love Superman, as I do, you will certainly enjoy these stories of Clark, Lana and their friends and foes, during Clark's second year of college.",1473465600,,511,4.425531914893617

Plots should be in two episodes like the old Batman series. Had to watch on fast forward. Christopher is OK, but not utilized well.",1466380800,,267,4.583333333333333
5448052,5,B00AKK6MD4,"Gerard Christopher is the Best Superman/Superboy Ever. People who watched Smallville and never watched this truly missed out. THis show was great. This was before people were told what to like. Comic fans, true comic fans choose to watch hero shows back then and were shunned. But Gerard Christopher was an icon to me and many other comic book fans. In season 2 he came aboard and he was such a good actor.

Christopher played Clark Kent really geeky but in a very likeable way. Whereas Reeves was very over the top, Christopher was more subdued but still did a job being geeky and nerdy. You believed his acting. When he was Superman his mannerisms changed and he talked louder and more confident. People claimed that Nolan's Batman played by Christian Bale did a good job changing his acting voice from Bruce to Bat really do not understand that Gerard did it first and did it better.

If you are a true fan you will love this. Season 1 is very hard to watch if you are one of those large ego people. But if you watch season 2 and beyond, this will be considered the best live action incarnation of a Superhero ever on the small screen. Christopher can be considered the best Superman portrayal right along Christopher Reeves.

The character Andy they brought in to replace TJ was annoying. He was a pointless character who was just looking for ways to capitalize on SuperBoy. Just these two aspects made it hard for me to sit through the episodes. The stories did get better this season.

5448060,4,B00AKK6MD4,"I remember watching some of the episodes from this particular season when I was younger. I haven't watched the entire season until I bought Superboy: Season 2. The season started out with Superboy's no. 1 nemesis - Lex Luthor as he appeared (at least three times) over the course of the season. Superboy and friends were depicted as college-age students with the supporting character of Andy McAlister as Clark Kent's roommate who served as a chaperone whenever Clark and Lana Lang were together. We get to see what happens to Superboy when he becomes exposed to red kryptonite for the first time in the episode, ""Super Menace.""

Many arch-villains from the comics were portrayed well on the small screen (Bizarro, Yellow Peri and Mr. Mxyzptlk) as well as some that were made up for the series. An android from the future, reminiscent to the Terminator character, appeared on the episode, ""Superboy...Rest in Peace.""

A few guest stars include Philip Michael Thomas (""Miami Vice"") in the episode, ""Brimstone"" and a younger Gilbert Gottfried as Nick Knack. There was a two-part episode where aliens marauded as Superboy's parents (Jor-El and Lara). Superboy also encountered Dracula twice during the second season.

Superboy pre-dated ""Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman,"" so the special effects were not as advanced. However, I give credit to the writers and the production department for staying true to the comic book portrayal of the characters. Do note that the mastering of the Superboy DVD series has flaws on some episodes whereby your DVD player will freeze up. On the second season, the flaw is most notable on the episode, ""The Haunting of Andy McAlister.""",1435449600,3,1676,5.043321299638989

WB through their Manufacturer on Demand(MOD)distribution has finally started to give us what we have wanted, the rest of the series. Unfortunately the episodes seem to be pulled from VHS masters and not much done to remaster anything. We also don't get an episode guide or features(the producer Ilya Salkind did say some extras were made back in 2006, so don't know where those are).

The 5 stars are for the fans who take their time and effort demanding WB this release. The dvds aren't remastered at all. The picture quality is pretty poor, same as it was when it was aired many years ago.

Thanks to WB for listening the fans, even sooo late. But no thanks at all for bringing a set of dvds totally bare bones. No subtitle options, no extras. Just a still main menu with the number of the episodes and that's it. At least the cover artwork matches 1st season.

5448077,5,B00AKK6MD4,"Many know that Season 2 brought in Bizzaro, Matello, and a more traditional Lex Luthor, but I was surprised to find many foreshadows to other Superman villains and future plots used on Lois and Clark and Smallville. Examples, I found foreshadows to Brianiac, Darksied, and Toyman; there are also characters similar to the heroes: Dr. Fate, Blade, a Legion Superheroes heroine, and a Wizard Shazam or HighFather esque characters. What follows is a guide for fans of Superman and other Superman tv shows, so as to help connect this tv serries to the much larger mythos of Superman media.

Ep 1&2
Plot: Lex Luthor get's surgery to change his appearance. His plot to lure Superboy in does involve a wedding between him and Lana.
Trivia:
- In the early 90's Lex Luthor will fake his own death and clone a younger body for himself. Here, we have the reverse (this idea of Lex switching bodies to hide his identity predates the storyline found in the comics).
-Superman get's paralyzed in this episode. One can not help but think of the accident of Christopher Reeves. This episode provides a sad and ironic image of what was to happen in real life.
- The body that Lex switches into is that of an CEO of a big exec company. In this episode you get a glimpse of the businessman Lex that is to come in the 90's.
Episodes to compare:
-House of Luthor (L&C season 1)
-Promise (Smallville season 6)

EP 3 &13
Matallo is introduced. Military does experiiments on Kryptonite and turns it into Red K. Military brings in Matallo to bring down Superboy.
Trivia: first introductions to Metallo and Red K.
When he's not in his Metallo outfit he wears crime boss suits that reminded me of the Burton era of Batman.
Compare:

Upgrade,  in this epidsode, Metallo is uprgaded, as well, to bring in a Red K Clark (Smallville season 9)
Individual Responsibility (season 2 of L&C)

Episode 4&15
Plot: Dracula is after his half-breed son who wants to invent a cure for the Vampire desease. Lana get's turned into a Vampire.
Trivia:
-Byron Shelly, named after either the two Romantic poets, or Mary Shelly the writer of Frankenstien.
-The character is very similar to Blade, the Marvel hero.
-The character is intersting enough that he could have even held his own spinoff series.
-This episode predates the Smallville episode where we see Lana turned into a Vampire going after to Clark to suck his blood. As similar reaction happens when Lana tries to suck his blood.
Compare:
Thirst (Smallville season 5)

Ep 6&7
Plot: Bizzaro is created and wants Lana to love him.
Trivia: Part of the plot is that Bizzaro posses as Clark Kent to get Lana to like him, and at that time, Lana believes it is the real Clark. Similar to the Bizzaro storyline in season 7 of Smallville.
Compare:

Ep 8
Plot: Mxyzptlk returns and needs Superboy's help.
Trivia:

Plot: We meet Andy's father, who has a past with a Brianiac esque villain.
Trivia:
The Brianiac esque villain uses a blackout similar to the blackout used in season finale of season 5 of Smallville.
-Both Andy, Jimmy of L&C, and JImmy of Smallville have an estranged with their father.
Compare:
-Superman III
-The Dad Who Came In From the Cold (Season 3 of L&C)

Ep 10
Plot: Superboy's powers are amplified and out of control in Lex Luthor's new scheme, which involves hitting Superboy with large amounts of Solar energy.
Compare:

Perry (Season 3 of Smallville)

Ep 11:
Plot: The personification of Evil get's released and wants to fight Earths personification of good, Superboy.
Trivia:
-The character is very similiar to how the Character of Darksied was handled in Smallville.
- Two characters have Similar roles that the Wizard Shazam has, as the watcher over the seven deadly sins.
-Visual allusions to the tree/fruit of Evil/Knowledge, Pandora's box, and a garden of immortality.
-My favorite episode this season.
Compare:
Season finale of season 10 of Smallivlle.

Ep 12
Plot: Someone from the future goes back in time to ""destroy"" Superboy from ever becoming Superman. A powerful heroine is sent into the past to protect Superboy.
Trivia: This Episode is Terminator meets Superboy.
- There is many similarties between this episode and the Legion ep of Smallville. Also the word Destroyer is used to describe the villain (in the Smallville epsisode that was the villains name).
-The actress featured in this ep has worked with the actor of Superboy in the past. It was a reunion episode.
Compare:
Tempus Fugitive (Season 2 L&C)
-Legion (season 8 of Smallville)

Ep 17
Plot: a Wizard of Evil is turning people into Zombies and only Doctor of Magic is able to come up with a cure.
Trivia:
Brimstone is the name of the character brought into this one. Brimstone is also the name of a villain used in the Comic even LEGENDS (but the name is the only thing these two characters share). Brimstone, here, is much more like a Dr. Fate character, but he looks more like Blade.
-Another connection with Dr. Fate is that his trailer that he lives in,  moreso acts as the Tower of Fate. When the characters go inside, instantly they walk into a big room and are clearly no longer inside the trailer.
-The villain in this one perhaps could be more like a Mordu type villain, or his father atleast.
Connection:
Dr. Fate episode of Superman animated series
Rabid & Absolute Justice (season 9 of Smallville)

Ep 18
Plot: Superman meets his birth parents, and after learning his true origins, they offer him a chance to go back to Krypton.
Trivia:
Both Jor-EL and Lara are played by a previous James Bond and Bond girl actress.
-There are hints of the Williams score for Krypton used for Jor-EL's and Lara's theme.

5448080,4,B00AKK6MD4,"""Superboy: The Complete Second Season"" saw many changes occur in regards to the cast and quality of villains the hero came up against. Gerard Christopher took over the role of the Boy of Steel from John Haymes Newton after salary and legal disputes tainted his attractiveness to the show's producers. Actor Scott Wells was replaced by Sherman Howard as Lex Luthor. His change in appearance was explained through the use of plastic surgery. Clark also got a new roommate in the form of Andy McCalister (Ilan Mitchell-Smith).

Many familiar super villains from the comic books made live-action appearances in Season Two of ""Superboy."" They included Metallo (Michael Callan), Bizarro (Barry Meyers), and a character fashioned after the Toyman named Nick Knack (Gilbert Gottfried). Metallo is reduced to being a thief who is transformed into a cyborg with a kryptonite heart by a mad scientist. I prefer him as a government-issued weapon of mass destruction the military uses to try to battle Superman, but that might be a bit too serious for this campy and light-hearted take on the Last Son of Krypton.

""Superboy: The Complete Second Season"" is clean fun for everyone. It's entertainment you can sit down and watch with the whole family. If you're kids are allowed to watch the 1970s and 1980s ""Superman"" movies, then they'll be alright here.

""Superboy: The Complete Second Season"" reflects the style and tone of Christopher Reeve's two outings as the Man of Steel from the 1980s. Those looking for the seriousness of Zack Snyder's latest incarnation of the character aren't going to find this TV series satisfying to your taste buds. If you enjoyed the cheesiness and humor of ""Superman III"" and ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,"" then this will bring a big smile to your face.",1386115200,,1779,4.983164983164984
5448081,4,B00AKK6MD4,"Of the 3 seasons of the ""Superboy"" series I have seen so far, I enjoyed this season the least.  I still rated it four stars, mainly because overall I have enjoyed the series so far, and although I was a little disappointed in this season, I still feel overall it is an excellent series.

I am not certain why the show was completely revamped from season one.  I read that the actor who portrayed Clark Kent/Superboy in the first season, had demanded a bigger paycheck to continue, and had also gotten a DUI, which prompted the producers to replace him.  This season saw vast changes from season one, with the exception of the actors that played Lana Lang, Jonathan and Martha Kent.

I don't believe in spoilers, however, I will say there were some good moments in this series (introduction of Bizarro, adding more classic Superman villains), but mostly more bad, like the new actor's portrayal of Clark Kent as being more weak and nerdy, and that portrayal seem to even carry over a little in the portrayal of Superboy, almost as if he sometimes forgot which character he was portraying.  Fortunately, in season 3, he seemed to find the right balance.

I also wasn't sure about the Lex Luthor change in the story line, didn't really make much sense to me, but you will have to make your own determination of how that plays out.  Lastly, the producers substituted one series regular from season one (T.J. White), with another (Andy McCalister) neither of whom in my opinion were necessary (I guess they decided so also, because this changed in season 3).

Overall, I recommend this season only because of continuity of the series.  Season 3 brought vast improvements over this one, and I can't wait for season four, which was recently released.",1384732800,,1743,4.7227722772277225
5448082,3,B00AKK6MD4,"I didn't see that much improvement in season 2 and thought there was no need to replace John Haymes with Gerard Christopher. Unlike John Haymes, Gerard Christopher now plays a dorky Clark Kent with big glasses. The only one who could pull that off and be good at it was Christopher Reeve, while other actors portrayed a serious Clark Kent. In this season they got a better opening instead of flying over water near a bridge, but they changed the second half of the theme song which was drums and replaced it with something else that isn't very good. Some of these episodes I think are a little more bizare than the first season, but there are still some good episodes like the two part show introducing Bizzaro superboy. On the back of the dvd cover it says that Lana marries Lex Luthor even before it happened on the tv show Smallville. This is a false Statement. In one episode Lex kidnaps Lana and forces her to marry him, but when the priest on the TV screen says are there objections? Superboy comes and says Yes and blows up the TV with his heat vision and they are not married. I would definitly suggest this show for anyone who likes Superman though.  Season 3 and 4 are suposed to be way better than the other seasons. I already bought mine and can't wait too watch them. Buy them at the WB Shop they are much cheaper there with free shipping and you can use the coupon code ANYCODES5 to get an aditional $5 off.",1384646400,2,1421,4.382575757575758

5448085,2,B00AKK6MD4,"I was curious to see the replacement superboy from the first season and saw no reason or need for it. In fact, I found the replacement annoying at times. The stories brought in new characters that haven't been used before and that was nice, but it is a 30 minute program and is limited. It is not anywhere near the quality of the George Reeves series. The other characters in this series range from forgetable to wishing they were replaced rather than superboy. If you have watched the character from radio and comic books through movie serials, television and the movies you probably will see this series, too, but don't expect too much.",1379980800,,638,4.654867256637168

Watching this newly released dvd of the second season, I think maybe the reason I liked the show so much was just Stacy Haiduk.  These episodes are, simply put, not good.  The stories are trite.  The dialogue is stiff.  The effects are awful.  (And, please, don't say it was because of the year the show was made.  STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION was on the air at the same time.)  The transfer to dvd is not great, either.  I have no way of knowing if that is because of the source material or the transfer process.  My final verdict: if you liked this show, skip the dvd, and keep your fond memories.",1377475200,,738,4.352941176470588

5448091,4,B00AKK6MD4,"It's good to see that the second season of Superboy has finally been released. Hopefully this is a good sign of things to come for the last two seasons.

The first season did a good job of getting the show off the ground, but the second season is definitely an improvement in some areas. We get a new, more villainous Lex Luthor, a new roomate for Clark and finally get to see some classic Superman villains such as Metallo, Yello Peri, Bizarro, among others. Gerard Christopher does a great job stepping in as Clark Kent/Superboy. Stacy Haiduk continues in the series as Lana Lang.

Throughout the season Superboy fought several Aliens, including a pair who captured him by impersonating Jor-El and Lara.

Also he fought a couple of A.I.'s.  One was an Android from the future, and the other was a 20th century experiment.

Finally a nice variety of Supernatural enemies.  An Imp and a Giant in one episode.  An ancient evil escaped from something similar the Pandora's Box in another. Then a spirit possessing a doll. A haunted house in the next. A sorcerer in one episode and an Alchemist in another.  And my favorite - Vampires.

It's great to see Superboy again.  This was worth the wait.",1368403200,,719,4.772357723577236

5448107,2,B00AKK6MD4,"I never watched these episodes when they first came out - so there's no nostalgia factor for me.  But I do have an appreciation for the character of Superman and as an avid comic book collector am very familiar with the Superboy aspect of his history.  Well, after reading all the other reviews I had high hopes that finally getting Season 2 on dvd would be worthwhile and fun to watch.  Not so much!  Most of these episodes are still painful to sit through!  Camp at the very least - kiddie fare at best!  Gerard Christopher is a huge hambone and is way over the top most of the time.  Ilan Mitchell-Smith is more annoying than anything else.  Watching Stacy Haiduk develop as an actress is at least interesting, but overall there's a lot of scenery chewing going on. The writing is geared towards youngsters, exclusively, and the outlandish plots are mostly unworthy of Andy Helfer, Cary Bates, Denny O'Neil, and Mike Carlin, etc.  I'm familiar with these guys from my comic collecting days - these guys were pros then, at the top of their game - but here, somehow they generally are quite underwhelming.  Classic characters like Metallo are turned into cartoons and Pollard as Mxyzptlk is pitiful.  The Bizarro episode was a worthy effort tho', but too few other episodes are even of this meager caliber.
So --  I have to await Season 3 and 4 - which by all other accounts offer a more adult, ""darker"" set of story-lines, better special effects, etc.
Having been burned with this set though - I'm not holding my breath!

5448109,4,B00AKK6MD4,"It seems like forever since ""Superboy"" Season one was released on Dvd (in actuality, it was released around the time Bryan Singer's ""Superman Returns"" was making its way into movie theatres and home Dvd). Now with the upcoming release of Christopher Nolan/Zack Snyder's ""Man Of Steel"", we get finally get Season two. As another reviewer mentioned, Season two is almost an entirely different show with improved writing, visual effects, and a new cast (with the exception of Stacy Haiduk as Lana Lang, and a return guest appearance by Michael J. Pollard as the hillarious imp, Mr. Mxyzptlk). Sherman Howard is cast as an artificially aged Lex Luthor, whose portrayal of Luthor is reminisent of Jack Nicholson's Joker (""Batman"", 1989), and Gerard Christopher replaces John Haymes Newman from Season one, as Superboy/Clark Kent. Ian Mitchell-Smith (""Weird Science"") replaces T.J. White as Clark's new roomate, Andy McCalister. Gerard Christopher's Kent is modeled on Christopher Reeves' Kent, playing the character as a wimpy Uber-nerd, the antithesis of the heroic Superboy. Unlike the previous Superman television incarnation, ""The Adventures of Superman,"" from the fifties, where Superman mainly dealt with ordinary criminals, ""Superboy"" battles super-villians with super/magical powers. ""Superboy"" has the distinction of being the only Superman television show produced the Salkind brothers, who gave us the original four Superman movies. This Dvd set has all 26 episodes from Season two, but unfortunately no extra features, which is why I must give it four and not five stars.",1360972800,3,1578,5.497942386831276

When it comes to the show itself is a fun watch and you will surely enjoy Gerard as the new Superboy. Overall l'm happy with my purchase. My issues have to do with everything else that it's not the show itself. First off is the quality of the discs, while the Audio. Video quality is just fine and l had no problems watching it on my HD TV, the discs are not actually DVD's, as we were told in advanced. Another thing missing and it's one of the things l like to get when l purchase my DVD's, the extras. No bonus material either, we were told of this ahead of time as well, but still. l know WHV is trying to make up for the money they put in the first time around but the overall quality of this set is really bad. From the stinky-black-recycled plastic case which included nothing, not an episode guide or a superman flyer inside to announce upcoming seasons. The DVD-R itself only includes an opening menu and that's it, no theme or anything. Just the episodes. Once again, l know why warner is depriving us from absolutely everything other than the episodes but as l write this review the price of season 2 is actually higher than season one. l will be buying the next seasons but come on Warner, l expect a bit more from my money. lf you love Superman, you'll enjoy the series, no Super DVD collection would be complete without it but do not expect a 1st. grade product, just enjoy the decent Audio-Video quality of the shows themselves. l rated 3 stars for the show, but the package and product is a 1.",1358121600,4,1720,4.279141104294479

From then through the end of the series, he kicks ass (especially loved him in season 3). Seriously, love him. Wish there would have been more seasons because he was so good. This season introduces some more baddy villains like Metallo, Yellow Peri and an older, far more entertaining Lex Luthor (Sherman Howard is fantastic). The writing is far better than in season 1 as is the acting and overall production quality. Plus Stacy Haiduk reprises her role as Lana and quite frankly, I say shes still the best Lana to date (though she really shines in seasons 3 and 4).
