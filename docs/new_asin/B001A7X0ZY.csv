Of course, people have a different definition of what comedy is to them, but I love this movie.",1511913600,,250,3.6296296296296298
8276341,1,B001A7X0ZY,"This movie is a waste of money. The plot is ridiculous, empty of any substance.",1431907200,,79,4.333333333333333

8276343,3,B001A7X0ZY,"If you put cams all over your house and post it online, make sure your family never finds out or your ruined.. I knew that before but I SEE YOU.COM helped me enhance that fact. The brother makes money doing that simple deed and the family finds out and play along and of course things go bad. They bring in other sexy people and try and up themselves..it's like that family guy episode...

This ain't anything new, but it's still fun to watch. Its got a good cast and has it's moments.",1287100800,,485,4.271739130434782
8276344,4,B001A7X0ZY,"I am going to keep this short but sweet. Boo to the last review. This movie is really entertaining. It may not be Lawrence of Arabia, but it's just a funny movie and Bridges and Arquette shine in it!",1245542400,3,199,4.128205128205129
8276345,1,B001A7X0ZY,"I give the film a ""D"" for development.  There is no real reason for this film to exist other than the few moments of humility you'll see.  Don't spend the money on it - rent it or netflix it.",1224892800,5,191,3.871794871794872
