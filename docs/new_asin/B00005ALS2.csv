1413893,4,B00005ALS2,"This movie was a very funny and very well written. I saw this with my wife and another couple and they enjoyed it, probably more than I did. Don't get me wrong it is a very good movie (as if I haven't said that enough). Clint, Tommy, James and Donald all are very funny (espeacially Donald - He thinks he is a sex god or something). I would be suprised if anyone hated this film.",986256000,3,379,4.066666666666666
1413894,4,B00005ALS2,"When I think of Space Cowboys, I always come back to the opening sequence:  it is, hands down, one of the funniest moments in movie history.  Not only was everyone in the theatre rolling in the aisles, but my fiance and I still laugh about it, many months later.
This is a sweet, funny, serious, and charming film that is sure to delight even the most jaded movie-goer.  It's worth a watch, and worth adding to your DVD collection.  Enjoy.",985392000,,439,4.45
1413895,4,B00005ALS2,"While this movie is described as about a group of aging astronauts called back into service, don't believe that cliche totally describes the movie.  It's quite funny and serious.  The training scenes with the younger astronauts makes this worth owning alone.  But more important is the critical plot that develops from what you think is the main plot about 3/4 of the way into the movie.  The cast was brilliantly selected and they all contribute in unique ways.  This film pays off in the end.  Enjoy!",984009600,,502,4.77906976744186
1413896,5,B00005ALS2,This movie has fun as the minutes roll on. It makes the older generation feel good and the young feel entertained. This was a box office sleeper but a must see in my opinion!,983059200,,174,4.147058823529412
1413897,5,B00005ALS2,This movie is a great mixture of fun and seriousness to it.  It shows that no matter what the age you are always able to have fun and that you are always needed.  I think that all the actors did a great job.,982886400,6,207,3.7906976744186047
1413898,4,B00005ALS2,"Good movie to spend an afternoon watching. It has an all star cast of some of Hollywood's greatest actors and just is enjoyable to watch. Here is the story, old guys train to go into outer space to fix nasa junk and its funny watching them train and see the old guys in space.",982886400,2,276,4.12962962962963
1413899,4,B00005ALS2,"Actually we get used to see Eastwood and Jones as the most serious actors in their films, wheras in Space Cowboys you might be a bit surprised about their roles. The film is very funny, not a slush comedie that bored people. Actors played their roles professinally. Nothing is exagerated but handled funny.  The DVD is perfect for collectors with its extra features, only disadventage is no more subtitle choice. In general, this is a very good film that you can see whenever you like if you have DVD.",982886400,2,501,4.629213483146067
1413900,4,B00005ALS2,"Though I didn't feel that this was one of the Greatest films made by the multi-talented Clint Eastwood, it is still one enjoyable flick from start to finish. A realistic space film that has all the elements (humour, adventure, romance, tension) in the right doses, and enough entertainment for the whole family.
The Casting made a great film even better, not one actor or actress is miss-cast, not one actor or actress is annoying. Clints direction is top drawer once again, perfect pacing, always fast, but also ample character development... It really is a really well made movie in all fields.
It misses out on one star as the screenplay leaves little room for Oscar worthy acting that Clint usually seems to like directing, so It would just seem off to give the film 5, even though on an entertainment scale, it would get one....",982886400,8,833,4.751724137931035

1414016,3,B00005ALS2,"Tired old story. Tired old actors. Predictable all the way through. And another cute young woman falls in love with lovable old fart story line. That's a real common Hollywood theme.

I wish there had been a few original ideas in the script. I wish they hadn't spent so long setting up the conflict and going through the predictable training. And I don't think NASA doctors are as stupid as the ones portrayed in this film -- blind-as-a-bat old guy fools young doctor into saying he has 20-10 eyesight? This is the sort of movie Bob Hope might have made decades ago.",1495670400,,566,4.549019607843137

1414038,3,B00005ALS2,"Super-duper predictable. It's fun to see some old pros having fun together, but why settle for such mediocre writing?

As far as performances, Tommy Lee Jones manages to make his scenes feel warm and believable, and Donald Sutherland has a good time playing against type as an aging ladies' man. Unfortunately, James Garner gets almost most nothing to do, while Eastwood relies on the same three faciak expressions he's used since Rawhide (snarly, shocked, and deadpan). Hollywood wish fulfillment at its blandest.",1485043200,2,514,5.2682926829268295

1414432,2,B00005ALS2,"I bought ""Space Cowboys"" on the suggestion of a college acquaintance, but after about the first twenty minutes, I was disappointed.  The story seems like a good idea (retired test pilots going into space (for the first time) to return an out-of-control Russian communications satellite), but there are so many scenes that require a total suspension of disbelief, it's really not worth the price.
  For example, the training time for a space shuttle mission by active, young astronauts is quoted as ""twelve months"".  Eastwood and his aging crew are going to accomplish it in...30 days.  The reason they can't just nudge the satellite back into orbit is that it's (and here one's nagging doubts begin to set in) ""too big"".  When they're in space and they finally sight the 1980 ""communications satellite"", it looks about five times the size of the space shuttle, and the shuttle (next to the ISS itself) is the largest spacecraft ever launched.  And then they are forced to decide that it must be somehow rocketed AND piloted to the moon, with a one-man pilot's chair conveniently sitting in the front of it, for just such a purpose.

  It's not totally bad.  If you follow Tommy Lee Jones, his acting has improved a lot over the years.  And Eastwood's command of space technology here as Corvin is impressive.  But unfortunately, James Garner is cast in the totally unbelievable role of a 60's test pilot who has somehow miraculously achieved the profession of...Oklahoma Baptist preacher.  By the way, don't forget the little ""significant"" Hawaiian mannequin he takes everywhere, though God knows what for.
  I think it's sad, because I""m one of the ""codgers"" ""Space Cowboys is presumably targeted for.  But it was also created for the usual  ""la-la land "" suckers that gape at ""space dramas"" such as this. ""Poor bastards"", as Hollywood-wise Bill Faulkner would put it,""but they try"".

Once restarted, we are treated to this wonderful experience of having to repeat the previous scenario at least two or three times.

1414532,5,B00005ALS2,"SPACE COWBOYS  has a great premise and starts out brilliantly and only falters just a bit in the third act. Clint Eastwood, James Garner, Donald Sutherland and Tommy Lee Jones are very good. However, Tommy Lee Jones looks about 15 years too young to be from the same era as the other three. Yet, I felt Jones came off the best and his character truly comes to an endearing end, which makes up for a lot in this film. All considered the camaraderie these four actors have really comes across and saves the day making the film really enjoyable. The animosity between James Cromwell and Clint Eastwood is central too the premise of this film and that also is enjoyable as it harkens back to the days when Dirty Harry bucked the system run by self-absorbed bureaucrats. As with most newer films, this Blu-ray version looks very good.",1421539200,,829,4.601351351351352

The four stars make for a fun old-and-cunning vs young-and-full-of-ego romp.  The old guys win and pull the whole mission out of the fire at the end, although one of the principles dies (he has nothing to lose), the movie is really entertaining, if slightly less than believable.

So, maybe it is a bit of a formula movie meaning - trouble/one group only can do job/good times/ real danger-possible failure/team succeeds/roll credits, however sprinkled in are some funny and enough genuine moments that make this not a bad pick for a movie night. Eastwood, Jones, Sutherland and Garner all look like they had fun making the movie and some of the moments while these retirees go back into training are very funny. But since they are up in age there are some problems and a medical scare that threatens the team. Due to it kind of following a formula it doesn't push this into must see range but you could do worse and it is a decent/fair pick.",1400198400,,756,4.4855072463768115

1414922,4,B00005ALS2,"Four old guys in space.  There's one question that comes to mind.  Given that an older, mentor-type character always dies in any space movie, which one of these guys is it gonna be?  No matter the answer, I will say that I was glad to see Donald Sutherland surviving past the first ten minutes of this film as I feel so many of his recent works has him dropping dead early on for one reason or another...it's squandering the man's talent.  Partial thanks to Mr. Sutherland's continuing pulse, this movie has a solid set of laughs and doesn't always make them too obvious with it's premises.  The four main actors, Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland, and James Garner, all interacted well together, even when those interactions weren't supposed to go well on the screen.  James Cromwell was perfectly slimy and self-serving and I kind of wish there had been a more fitting conclusion for his character considering the certain implications that were made.  William Devane was a great straight-man within all the lunacy and Marcia Gay Harden held her own as a confident NASA employee who helps oversee the mission and becomes a love interest for Mr. Jones.  I do say ""thank God"" that the movie didn't devote too much screen time to that last plot device.  One of my favorite moments in the film is the four main characters appearance on Jay Leno, which is second only to the scene with the spinning training thingy (sorry for my complete lack of correct termonology.)  Overall, this movie is meant to bring you some laughs and that's what it delivers.  Enjoy.",1387324800,5,1572,4.742647058823529

The gathering of 4 good actors that at one time they were astronauts and now retired, each doing their own thing. they were all good, as they put it the best at what they did, while they were on active duty. Good friends among all of them, except you always gonna have those two that have a reason to not get along and still have not forgotten the other one about, but still they make it work. They get recruited to save the world, although there was some resistance from some people on command, due to their age, but eventually of course gave in as long as theyr were accompanied by some of the ones in active duty now, to assist because as you can imagine so many years have gone by, these people never flown a shuttle before. anyway, they get the job done.

Bring together 4 stars, well 6 if you include (and I do) James Cromwell and William Devane.  There is enough comedy and drama and adventure contained in this movie so that it should never get anything but 5 stars.  And yet....

Realistically, this movie should not work - but it does.  Mainly for the reasons I stated above - the actors.  Not the strongest script or concept, but the cast just nails it.

1415010,4,B00005ALS2,"This Clint Eastwood vehicle sort of came and went. It surfaced back in 1982 under the radar, then dissapeared too quickly. That is a shame because though it is not the sort of film that you expect from Eastwood it does have some real redeeming value. For one thing Eastwood's performance here is actually one of the best of his career. Eastwood plays a down and out, aspiring but ailing country singer that never really got the break he was hoping for. He decides to make one last effort to get a name for himself because he knows his time left on earth might not be too much longer. So he set's off toward Nashville in the hope of making his dream come true. Along for the ride is his son Hoss, played by Eastwood's son Kyle. Kyle hasn't done much acting but he has made a name for himself as a musician and has actually written some movie scores. Eastwood also sings in this movie for the first time(as far as I am aware) since he appeared in 'Paint your Wagon'. Clint s not the greatest singer in the world, but he really didn't do too bad considering he is playing an aging singer who also has lung cancer. The film is full of pretty good period detail, costumes, decent acting by all, and a reasonable script. In fact if this movie were made now it might have had a shot at a best picture Oscar because it really is better than most movies I have seen over the past 5 years or so. No this is not a great movie or a classic, but Eastwood is really very likable in this role, and I felt he did a really good job playing this character.",1371427200,2,1538,4.199324324324325

With Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland, and James Garner suiting up for a senior discount NASA space shuttle mission, I'd say the only way to improve that shuttle crew would have been to add Jack Nicholson or Morgan Freeman. Or, perhaps, they might have gotten Danny Glover if only for an opportunity for him to reprise (yet again) his ""Lethal Weapon"" line: ""I'm too old for this s***!""

Each had their good parts, but I would rate Deep Impact as the better of the two.  Space Cowboys is similar in that it deals with a deadly threat from space, but from a far more likely source: other people.  Probably not in the top 100 best movies, but still worth watching.

1415145,4,B00005ALS2,"Clint Eastwood manages to turn an outrageous premise into a pretty good movie in 1990's ""Space Cowboys.""  When a huge and decaying Russian satellite threatens earth, NASA has to track down the original designer of its (stolen) guidance system to save the day.  That turns out to be fiesty and long-retired US Air Force Colonel Frank Corvin (Eastwood), who reluctantly agrees to help if he can take his buddies from an aborted 50's manned space program with him into orbit.

Team Daedalus brings together the talents of Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland, and James Garner, dubbed ""the ripe stuff"" by their much younger NASA colleagues.  The first half of the movie contains much humor as the retirees are subjected to NASA screening and training for their space shuttle rescue ride.  In the background, Frank's old boss and current NASA director (James Cromwell) schemes to maroon the oldsters on the ground while covering up a Cold War plot of major proportions.  Once the team gets into space, however, things get very interesting very fast; Corvin and his buddies will face some tought choices and long odds to complete their mission.

This is a fun movie that manages some real dramatics at the end.  The story is helped along by some impressive special effects and the sense that the veteran actors are really enjoying themselves.  A strong supporting cast includes Marcia Gay Harden, William Devane, Loren Dean, Courtney Vance and Blair Brown.

1415166,3,B00005ALS2,"Space Cowboys(released Aug/00)is an average Eastwood movie which should have been much better than it was. The film contains a plethora of special effects including much CGI which Eastwood seems to have little luck with;see his other S/FX laden effort Firefox. The film also contains a boffo of a cast which on paper looks tremendous:Tommy Lee Jones,James Garner and Donald Sutherland,but again just adding more gas to the lacklustre fire.
The film starts off in the late 1950s and focuses on a group of four men called the Daedalus team,all test pilots and part of the U.S.'s efforts to go into outer space. However all the best efforts of the team seemingly go for naught as the program's first astronaut into space goes to a chimpanzee. Team Daedalus is eventually scrapped and the team one by one retires out of the program into civilian life.
Fast forward to present day and a huge Soviet satellite is in danger of orbit decay and the on board antiquated controls were originally designed by ex Daedalus team leader Col. Corvin(Eastwood).But wait,how did a Soviet made satellite come to have the Colonel's designed guidance system on board?This question and others are raised as the film advances and NASA sends for the Colonel for his assistance. Corvin is none too pleased to be back under the aegis of his old boss and the rhetoric soon starts flying. Corvin suggests that only the original Daedalus team be sent up to repair the satellite. Much wrangling occurs until his old boss gives in and agrees. However two back ups will be trained and sent up with them...just in case.
Corvin seeks out his old team Col. Hawkins(Jones),Capt. O'Neil(Sutherland) and Capt. Sullivan(Garner)and soon the group is training hard for their flight due to go up in a matter of weeks. The flight launch comes and soon after the group are face to face with the satellite. During their EVA Corvin finds the reason for the girth of the satellite;it carries a contingent of nuclear missiles. Corvin orders them all back to the shuttle where he sees no alternative but to cancel the mission. One of the two subs along for the ride has been given hush,hush orders to reposition the satellite by himself if something untoward should happen. He returns to the satellite and tries but ends up activating it sending it spinning out of control,wrecking it and almost taking out the shuttle with it. In an emergency effort Colvin goes out and amazingly is able to bring the satellite out of its death plunge. However the missiles themselves have to be disposed of and Col. Hawkins volunteers to take a suicide ride with them towards the moon where somewhere along the way he will eject them into space but he will himself crash land on the moon.
With most of his engines damaged and little fuel Corvin attempts a heretofore impossible manual re-entry. Once inside the Earths atmosphere the two subs are sent out the hatch to parachute to safety. Corvin orders his team out but they elect to stay to the end. Corvin,despite the odds,indeed lands the shuttle manually at the Space Center in Florida. The film ends with Corvin and his wife looking at the moon and wondering whether Col. Hawkins made it. We are given the answer as we see a debris field,footprints leading away and the Colonel leaning against a rock looking up towards Earth.
As the film winds its way along it becomes obvious there isn't much wind in the sails here as far as a good,juicy plot. Sure it's nice to see this group of actors together on the screen and all acquit themselves nicely,but there is really little of substance to put this film over the top. As I said,it looked great on paper but on film,a BIG disappointment. Not a bad film by any stretch but just average fair that any competent director could have pulled off easily.
Technically,while I don't see the word ""remastered"" anywhere,this print is obviously superior to the last release of this film. Then again Warners has re-released much of Eastwoods films recently and all are in the same good form as this print. It is clear and quite crisp and is in its' original widescreen a/r. Extras include an on-location featurette,a convo with the S/FX guys,an expanded version of the Jay Leno spot in the film,a convo with the editor and the theatrical trailer.

The movie was somewhat entertaining, but it came out of the era following the end of the Soviet Union and the Cold War and seemed very badly dated. It was sorta like viewing very stale news. It was fiction, of course, but we greatly prefer something like Star Trek for space fiction. In any case, he acting was excellent, if not a bit overdone in places and it was a good cast. The story was interesting, if not somewhat far fetched. The photography was excellent and the Skylab views of the Earth were spectacular and well worth viewing. The movie had a mildly amusing tone to it. All in all, ""Space Cowboys"" provided good, if  somewhat stale, entertainment, but I just couldn't rank it along with the better Clint Eastwood films.

1415197,4,B00005ALS2,"Space Cowboys is enjoyable on many levels. Clint Eastwood, James Garner, Tommy Lee Jones, and Donald Sutherland are a superb cast who live up to their past accomplishments. The story itself begins with these 4 as test pilots in the late 1950s being excluded from the astronaut program, which is populated with younger college graduates and engineers. These old ""stick and rudder"" test pilots are jealous and resentful, and carry the grudge for the next 40 years. Then they are called upon 40 years later to solve a problem with a Russian satellite. Many old scores remain to be settled with the NASA management and among themselves. The human interactions are facinating, and multi-layered. The 4 each have strong but different personalities which contribute to the movie. For those old enough to remember the 50s it is also nostalgic. The 4 eventually go on a space mission to ""fix"" a Russian satellite. The reasons and results of the mission are full of twists, turns and surprises (which I won't ""spoil"" here). Their ""stick and rudder"" skills save the day after computer failure, redeeming human skill in the age of computers.

I got in bad with my fiance for wanting to make out with her, but I told her I really didn't want to watch this movie.

 It's pretty long at 130 minutes but the four diverse characters help keep your interest. Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland and James Garner are quite a foursome. Add Marcia Gay Harden to the mix, along with Loren Dean, Courtney Vance and James Cromwell and you have a fabulous cast.

This is a drama but one in which there is a fair amount of comedy and some romance. There are some Hollywood clichs (a suspect boss, arguing pals going back-and-forth all the time, a weak minister, etc.) but they aren't as blatant as usual.

1415216,5,B00005ALS2,"Space Cowboys (2000)was a really well done movie that rated five stars with this reviewer. This film was really fine and the outstanding special effects, story line, humor, and basic premise are all very excellent and  plausible extensions of reality.

A movie like this one should have been made long ago about the actual early space pioneers who piloted the X-1, X-2, through the X-15. When something needed to happen aboard these craft the pilot had to make it happen and often only by the seat of his pants.

Although some well deserved credit has been given to Chuck Yeager, and some others who made it to the Apollo Program (i.e., Neil Armstrong, White, etc.) none of the very early rocket plane pilots have been aboard the Shuttle gaining public attention (with the possible exception of Mercury Astronaut John Glenn, America's first man in orbit aboard the Atlas ICBM) and they are not mentioned nearly enough in modern discussions of space flight.

The quality of this film's special effects was excellent! For those who think that the altitude record of the X-15 only brought her pilots to the threshold of space, civilians will shortly be paying a big price tag to essentially repeat (give or take) the altitude record set by that aircraft aboard Virgin Galactic's space plane.  They are also being told in the interest of good marketing that they will travel in a sub-orbital spacecraft.

1415218,4,B00005ALS2,"When I first saw this film, I didn't really dig it.  A 2nd viewing helped immensely.  While it's not one of Clint's greatest works, it's still immensely watchable and surprising.  It was also Clint's biggest opening until his recent film, Gran Torino (which is excellent).

Clint plays a somewhat disgraced pilot who has to come back to NASA to fix a Russian satellite, which somehow has a programme that he designed (we find out later it was stolen during the days of the Cold War).  He assembles his old crew (Donald Sutherland, James Garner, and Donald Sutherland), and goes along with a young crew.  The film starts out rather quietly, as we see the four men living their lives in relative comfort.  When Clint blackmails his former boss (played by James Cromwell) into letting him and his old crew go into space, they all have to pass the same physicals the new recruits do.  William Devane, who plays the leader of mission control at NASA, is also sceptical, and insists on putting his own crew with Eastwood's.  The narrative is very leisurely here, with some good observations about aging, modern day journalism, and some corny, though funny, jokes about aging and manhood.

It would have been easy for Clint to just let the narrative flow and make a nice but inconsequential film about old astronauts, but Clint doesn't do that.  The film takes a surprising and excellent turn in the last third.  It turns out that the satellite that Clint has to repair has nuclear warheads on it, and the last third is incredibly suspensful and has excellent special effects.  The tension Clint creates here is really good, reminiscent of his very underrated film, Firefox.  It's very intense and extremely well done.  And the ending is one of bittersweetness and surprising poignancy.

Space Cowboys is a must for any real Eastwood fan.  It's not his greatest work, but it has many things to recommend it.  Great special effects, good pacing, and great performances.  It's a very good Clint picture.",1235174400,,1994,4.828908554572271

While far from Eastwood's deepest efforts, this film is a reminder that Eastwood is a capable comedic director and still provides moments (albeit superficial ones) of reflection on the subject of aging.  The chemistry between the main performers is very good and the fun they likely had making this film shines through.  Without Eastwood's capable direction and his high quality cast, however, the story would have fallen flat.  It is a movie that succeeds, partly, in spite of its premise, precisely because Eastwood has the clout to assemble this level of talent for what is, essentially, a puff piece (and there is nothing wrong with a good quality puff piece--not every film has to be a work of ""high art"").

Let me immediately address four problems with this movie.

1.  It is too long.  True, that length helped out in developing the characters, but it could have been shortened.  Some criticized Firefox for the length of time spent in dealing with Eastwood's character being trained, which was not really dealt with in the original novel.  Eastwood has fallen into the same trap here, though the cast in this movie makes it forgivable.

2.  The language.  I feel there are two kinds of movies regarding offensive words -- those that have unnecessary bad language, and those without bad language.  It may have caused some chuckles, but that is cheap humor, and again was not necessary.

3.  The payoff.  This movie did a good job of creating the mystery, such as why American technology was on a Soviet satellite, but the payoff was weak.  So was the finale, in my opinion.

4.  Tank.  The movie made it come across that Tank (James Garner) was more effective at his role on the mission than being a minister, which bothers this ordained minister.  Is it an attempt to poke fun at Christianity as a whole, saying we all are stupid?  Or was it making Tank seem to be out of his league?

These complaints do not keep this from being entertaining.  It is a movie I'd have no real problems (other than those listed above) to taking a jr. or sr. high school student to see.  It is entertaining, without relying on sex and violence.  It is basically a waste of time, but it is entertaining in wasting the time, and a lot of times that is what movies are supposed to do.

One last comment I'll make.  This movie shows some of the problems of our government without making the government the villain.  I like that.  I don't need a movie that considers our government to be infallible, but I also don't need one that treats it as evil either.",1184889600,,2060,4.576923076923077

However, forty years later a Russian communications satellite with a deadly secret aboard has just gone into a decaying orbit that will bring it down onto the earth.  The system was based on designs that Corvin created, and he's asked to help.  Only Corvin isn't going to sit at the table without taking a hand.  By the time he gets through blackmailing NASA, Team Daedalus -- now retired -- is going to fly again.

Director Clint Eastwood brought together Tommy Lee Jones, James Garner, and Donald Sutherland to play the four aging astronauts.  As they reveal in the accompanying documentary on the disc, all of them had a blast working on the film.  Eastwood has created a string of hits as an actor as well as a director, including FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS in theaters now.

SPACE COWBOYS is a great time.  The opening sequences reminded me of THE RIGHT STUFF (which I suggest viewing if you haven't to get another look at the developing space program).  As Corvin blackmails NASA and goes around gathering his old team, you can't help but be drawn to the characters.  They're some of the best actors ever to come our way, and have been in dozens of films.  The transition from humorous, heart-felt piece to thriller in the last third of the movie clunks a little, but there was no way around it.  Watchers want the feel-good to continue, but the menace has to assert itself and our heroes have to deal with it.

I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  The Blu-ray edition lacks a little in the audio department compared to some of the discs that are coming out on the market at the moment, but the picture quality is some of the best.  The movie's probably more of a guy's film, but it's a good peace offering if you have to split the difference between an action movie and a chick flick.",1163289600,,2225,4.6183206106870225
1415267,5,B00005ALS2,"This film has a great premise and starts out brilliantly and only falters just a bit in the third act. Clint Eastwood, James Garner, Donald Sutherland and Tommy Lee Jones are very good. However, Tommy Lee Jones looks about 15 years too young to be from the same era as the other three. Yet, I felt Jones came off the best and his character truly comes to an endearing end, which makes up for a lot in this film. All considered the camaraderie these four actors have really comes across and saves the day making the film really enjoyable. The animosity between James Cromwell and Clint Eastwood is central too the premise of this film and that also is enjoyable as it harkens back to the days when Dirty Harry bucked the system run by self-absorbed bureaucrats. As with most newer films, this Blu-ray version looks very good.",1162944000,,824,4.574324324324325
1415268,4,B00005ALS2,"This is a fun movie based on an interesting premise.  Back in the 1950's it was the Air Force that assumed that they were going to lead the country into space.  Air Force test pilots were pushing aircraft to the edges of space and preparing to become the first astronauts when space research was taken away from the Air Force and became the mission of the newly created civilian agency, NASA.  This was a real shocker to most of the top pilots of the Air Force, and although many of them left the Air Force to join the fledgling NASA eventually making it in to space, many like Chuck Yeager, (the man who broke the sound barrier) stayed in the suddenly mundane Air Force.  Yeager served in Vietnam, and led an Air Force Fighter Group in Europe in the 1970's, but never got closer to space than he was in the late 50's.

In this movie, Clint Eastwood plays Frank Corvin a Yeager-like member of a fictional Air Force project called Team Daedalus that was pushing at the limits of space in the late 50's, only to have the rug pulled out from under them when space research went to NASA.  Tommy Lee Jones plays Hawk, the best pilot on the team, and James Garner and Donald Sutherland are supporting members of the team.

The movie starts very effectively as a blue-tinted flashback to the Muroc glory days of the Air Force sometime in 1958 with a portrayal of Team Daedalus' fall from grace.  The theme music, written by Eastwood who also directed the movie, complements perfectly this nostalgic look at simpler and starker times.

Flashing forward to the present the film picks up the pace as we learn that the Russians have a huge communications satellite called Ikon that has a deteriorating orbit and will be plummeting to Earth in 70 days or so.  The Russians are adamant that the satellite must be saved and the only way to do it is with the Space Shuttle.  Unfortunately, the shuttle isn't big enough to retrieve the massive satellite to return it to Earth, so repairs will need to be made in orbit.  Adding to the complexity of the project is that the guidance system is 1970's era technology and there is no one around that knows enough about it to fix it.

Surprisingly, it turns out that the guidance system is a copy of the guidance system that Eastwood's character Frank Corvin designed for SkyLab in the 1970's, and Corvin is still around, although retired.  Suffice it to say that Corvin is lured out of retirement by the chance to go into space as long as he can take the other members of the old Team Daedalus with him.

Eastwood, Jones, Garner and Sutherland are hilarious as the cantankerous old veterans cramming to learn how to fly a crash Space Shuttle mission.  And James Cromwell, one of Hollywood's great character actors of the last 20 years does a fantastic job of playing the oily project manager, Bob Gerson.  Cromwell is the kind of guy that seemingly pops up in small roles in every movie you see, but never actually stars in one.  Every era of Hollywood has actors like that, think of Sidney Greenstreet in the 30's and 40's, and without them movies wouldn't be what they are.  That said, Cromwell is truly great in this movie in what he does best, a supporting role.

The rest of the movie is pretty standard: they go into space, things don't work out the way they were planned, there's a surprise or two, a disaster to be averted, and a ""will they make it?"" trip home.  But the special effects are fantastic, everything outside of the shuttle was done with computer graphics with the actors faces plopped in behind their face shields, and it is absolutely convincing.  Of course you hear the hiss of the propulsion units on the space suits and the roar of the maneuvering rockets in supposedly silent space, but physics has never been Hollywood's strong point.

And while the second half of the movie is pretty formulaic, it is well done.  The first half of the movie is different enough to make the whole thing an interesting and entertaining whole.",1162512000,6,3980,4.557584269662922

1415272,4,B00005ALS2,"This is a fascinating film in many respects. Most view it as popcorn entertainment, and it certainly is, but I find it much more. It conjures up the myth of the frontier and the ""Turner Thesis"" to evoke a powerful image of Americans confronting the unknown. It is, perhaps, the most powerful recent public image of the frontier in space exploration. ""Space Cowboys,"" a film by Clint Eastwood, himself an actor closely identified with the mythic American West, opened in 2000 to mixed reviewed. I want to offer my reading of the film as a mythical statement of the American frontier transferred to the ""final frontier,"" space.

This film begins in 1958 with a quartet of young military test pilots of Team Daedalus flying advanced aircraft in the high desert of California--a l the opening of ""The Right Stuff""--crashing the test vehicle for silly but improbable reasons, and then being sacked and replaced by a chimpanzee for spaceflight. Presumably these four intrepid aviators--Frank Corvin (Clint Eastwood),  Hawk (Tommy Lee Jones), Jerry (Donald Sutherland), and Tank (James Garner)--were to be the first Americans in space although how this was supposed to take place was not explained in the film. Dismissed from their program, forty years later Corvin is summoned by longstanding rival and NASA official Bob Gerson (James Cromwell) to repair and reboost what is thought a Russian communications satellite. It contains an obsolete guidance system that Corvin designed and that only he can repair. It turns out that this is actually a leftover cold war satellite equipped with live nuclear warheads that the four buddies have to get rid of and thereby prove their mettle. Humorous to a fault, much of the remainder of the story revolves around a bunch of old geezers--described in tabloids as ""The Ripe Stuff""--finally having a chance to achieve their youthful dream. For one of them at least, Hawk, it was reaching the Moon. He failed to achieve his dream of participating in Apollo, but survives a crash landing on the Moon at the end of the film as Frank Sinatra sings the rousing chorus of ""Fly Me to the Moon.""

""Space Cowboys"" subtly creates a duality of young organization man/old frontier individualist. The older ""frontiersmen"" have a knowledge and skill necessary to ""conquer"" space but are out of step with the system. There are constant comments on the inability of NASA to control Corvin and the other members of Team Daedalus. At the same time, the second part of the film--the mission--demonstrates the capability of the elderly frontiersmen to overcome even the most insurmountable problems and ""conquer"" space. In so doing, they disprove the belief that they are outdated and irrelevant. ""Space Cowboys"" succeeds well as a study in the deconstruction of its heroes and their place in modern America, while also providing satisfying entertainment. Most important, the film deconstructs the traditionally romanticized conception of the young hero by depicting the four old friends as sensible and judicious--yet flawed--septuagenarians still capable of great heroism. The villains in the film are senior NASA and Russian space officials who conspire to subvert the mission, aided by career astronauts who are depicted as snotty and cocky kids without judgment or skill.

Eastwood obtained NASA assistance in making this film, being allowed to shoot at the Johnson Space Center, the Kennedy Space Center, and the Dryden Flight Research Center. ""I wanted to make the film as believable as possible,"" Clint Eastwood said. ""In order to do that we needed NASA's help to get as close as we could to the circumstances surrounding a launch. It's a complicated process and it requires careful planning and teamwork on all levels. Bringing a film crew in to simulate the whole thing was probably an even bigger headache for NASA, but the agency really came through for us. I couldn't be more pleased with the results"" (See ""Space Cowboys-The Facts,"" Sciflicks.com, available on-line at [...] accessed April 24, 2004).

Ironically, NASA emerges from this film as the butt of most of the jokes. The film satirizes the stuffiness of NASA for seemingly going out of its way to make the most exciting activity imaginable, spaceflight, look boring. The linkages between spaceflight and the frontier are paramount throughout the film. Beginning with the title of the film, the principal star and his relationship to the mythic West depicted in Hollywood, the other stars--except Donald Sutherland--also have significant western acting credits, and the imagery of conquest and taming of the frontier of space all conspire to offer a mythic vision of spaceflight as a ""final frontier."" In the end, space is a place to be conquered in the same way that the mythical frontier of the American West was conquered. In the process, and the heroes of ""Space Cowboys"" perfectly embody these virtues, America will be revitalized in the model of Frederick Jackson Turner and his ""Frontier Thesis."" ""Space Cowboys"" evokes a deeply mythical understanding of spaceflight and the adventure that was Apollo.",1131494400,5,5093,5.138721351025332

""Space Cowboys"" is a well-made, superbly acted tribute, of sorts, to the adventuresome spirit that once inspired a nation.

Though there are a few plot discrepencies, the overall appeal of the film, with its blend of masculine bravado, humor, and suspense, makes it a captivating viewing experience.

1415292,3,B00005ALS2,"One can't help but admire this film which was a surprise box office hit in 2000.  Most industry insiders didn't think audiences would flock to see four ""senior citizens"" conquer outer space.  But to director/star Clint Eastwood's credit, he managed to craft a movie that attracted audiences and it did much better than expected.

I liked SPACE COWBOYS..to a point.  The script was very confusing as to what was exactly going on once they got into space.  The special effects are magnificent, though, in their simplicity and the movie has a haunting effect in these well done scenes.  You can't fault the actors for trying though.  Eastwood was starting to enjoy his aging machismo, and it shows in this movie as he clumsily participates in a fight scene with his co-star, Tommy Lee Jones.  Jones' character is only slightly drawn, though; his medical problem seems too manipulative to be believable; Donald Sutherland is wonderful as the lolthario, but he isn't given enough screen time; nor is James Garner's Reverend Tank allowed as much time as Eastwood or Jones.  Marcia Gay Harden seems out of place with her prim and proper hairdo and mannerisms; James Cromwell is effectively villainous, and Loren Dean does a nice job as the youthful Ethan.  While there are some neat jokes and the expected yuks from the aging astronauts, the movie's pace in the first 2/3 is a little too slow for my tastes, and the final shot of Tommy Lee is just too cute.  Sure, it's a flag-waving testimonial to endurance, faith and teamwork, but SPACE COWBOYS just didn't have enough oomph to make me really find it a classic.",1113004800,2,1607,4.807272727272728

1415294,4,B00005ALS2,"Almost every child goes through a stage where they want nothing more than to be an astronaut when they grow up. For most that stage is short lived, but for some that stage never goes away. It is this idea that is at the heart of director Clint Eastwood's latest film, Space Cowboys, a tale of four aging Air Force pilots who get a second chance to do what they wanted to do most for over forty years, go into space.

Eastwood stars as Frank Corvin, the leader of a former group of test pilots know as Team Daedalus. After making it as close as can possibly be to space without actually being there, the program was disbanded in 1958 in favor of NASA. Upon this occurrence Frank and the other three members of the crew Hawk (Tommy Lee Jones), Jerry (Donald Sutherland) and Tank (James Garner) went their own separate ways. Frank went on to become a great early engineer for NASA by designing the guidance system for the Skylab project. The film then fast-forwards to the present, where a serious situation has occurred with a former USSR satellite that is loosing its orbit and will soon crash into earth. You're probably thinking what's the big deal about one Soviet satellite, but that big deal is eventually revealed in one of the film's bigger payoffs. Anyway, the Soviet satellite mysteriously runs on the same guidance system as Skylab, which is so old that no one at NASA can understand it and in one of the film's funnier ongoing jokes, everyone that could once understand it is now dead. Their ultimate solution is to get Frank to fix it.

Frank smells something fishy in all of this and as a result plays out the situation as best he can. So well in fact, that he is able to get NASA top dog Bob Gerson (James Cromwell), the same official who stopped Frank from making it to space in the first place, to allow him and the rest of Team Daedalus to go into space in exchange for his being able to fix the problem. Frank then goes out to gather up Tank, now a minister, Jerry, a roller coaster engineer with a heavy sex drive, and Hawk, a high-risk pilot who hasn't spoken to Frank for years. The crew then goes through the rigorous training that is needed for them to go into space, which provides the film's biggest laughs. The film provides a lot of them, and as you would expect, the vast majority of which surround their age. Unlike most of this summer's other comedies Space Cowboys is able to be funny without being downright cruel, as the film's humor is more of a case of us laughing with the members of the crew than our laughing at them. The members of the crew are old; they know it and are as willing to accept it just as the audience does.

After the training has been completed, a few plot twists here and there, and a few side stories such as the relationships between Frank and Hawk, Frank and Gerson, and Hawk and a NASA official played by Marcia Gay Harden, the launch date finally arrives. Its here were the film sheds its light-heartiness as it takes itself much more seriously while in space. The space scenes are toned down in comparison to those seen as of late in recent space films, but at the same time still amazing nonetheless. The film doesn't go special effects heavy, but instead uses just what is necessary to make it seem so real. This same relative simplicity was also quite noticeable in the film's opening air sequence, which like the space scenes is also very effective in making a big impact despite not going overboard. At the same time, I also had some problems understanding exactly what was going on during the space mission as parts went unexplained while the angles of certain shots also added to the confusion of the action at hand. Also hurting the scene was the situation back in Houston, which didn't help increase tension of the situation. All in all, the space scene was still pretty well done, and certainly a nice change of pace.

Most of the film's performances were all top notch, as one would expect from a cast of this caliber. It's easy to identify with the crew, and just as easy to dislike Cromwell's character. My only complaint in this regard is with Garner's character, who just wasn't given enough screen time to really develop when compared to the other three members of the crew.

After viewing the film I couldn't help but think of the similarities to 1998's Armageddon in terms of plot. I enjoyed parts of that film, but felt that it took itself way to seriously in addition to being much too over the top in multiple aspects throughout. Space Cowboys is almost the complete opposite in this regard as it is very toned down, and with a few exceptions, lacks any real seriousness throughout the first 2/3 of the film. While that was more enjoyable than the corniness of Armageddon, it also hurt the film to a certain extent, as it could have really used a few more serious moments here and there to balance itself a little more and to help build up the tension surrounding its final act. Other than that, and the fact that the film doesn't really bring anything new to the table, Space Cowboys provides a very enjoyable experience by succeeding in almost everything it tries to accomplish. And as many science fiction films before it have proven time and time again, Space Cowboys reiterates the fact that sometimes less is more, especially in space.

The idea of sending 4 elderly, unexperienced pilots into space to save a Russian satellite is ridiculous in itself.  This movie makes a mockery of the space program.  Astronauts go through years of training to travel into space and fly the space shuttles.  Doing complicated space walks to repair satellites requires even more extensive training.  In this film, this training is done in several weeks.  Once in space, the shuttle is battered to the extent that it would be incapable of surviving re-entry in real life.  At the end, not only does Clint Eastwood re-enter the Earth's atmosphere and lands the shuttle just fine, but he does so without a functioning onboard guidance computer.

1415314,4,B00005ALS2,"Several years ago John Glenn was launched into space as the first senior citizen to do so.  In doing so, NASA inadvertantly sent a message:  being older doesn't mean being any less effective.  It was a dynamite message to the world that anyone who'd seen a single episode of the Golden Girls or watched a single presidential speech by Ronald Reagan (our most senior president ever elected) could have told you.  However, it is a message that continues to bear repeating.
Space Cowboys takes the John Glenn trip one (or four) further.  In the prologue,four early jet pilot/astronaut pioneers get a bum treatment at the hands of a government ladder climbing boss, and are effectively ousted from the space program.
Flash forward forty years and our four early space pioneers are the not-so-young Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, James Garner and Donald Sutherland.  NASA calls upon Clint to repair a communications satellite because he invented the computer boards which are on it - but how did NASA's technology get into a Soviet satellite?
Slated to be advisory only, Eastwood manages to finagle his ""team"" on the space shuttle to repair the satellite.
The film spends a great deal of time on the backstory and the training of these ""geezers"" as they prepare for space launch.  It spends too little on the space adventure itself.  I don't begrudge one minute of the backstory, but I wish more time had been spent on the adventure.  It feels rushed when compare to the rest of the film. I won't divulge any of the excitement that takes place, but suffice it to say there is plenty.
Eastwood directed this film and is credited with assisting in writing it as well.  He's done a fine job.  It is very refreshing to see American actors with wrinkles faces and bodies acting their age instead of pretending to be young studs in romantic comedies with young women.  It's also refreshing to see these senior actors are (I'm assuming) plastic surgery free.

But the plot and script are full of holes large enough to drive a Soyuz through.  Just one -- it's inconceivable that this mission would be flown without a serious set of schematics for the ""communication satellite"" and probably a gaggle of Russian techies hanging around for reference.  Instead, we have the one sinister Russki aparatchik with a secret.  It all seems to be handled like a small discretionary fund project, instead of a novel, newsworthy Major Event.
The thirty day buildup for a complex new mission would be hard to swallow using personnel already familiar with the STS systems, but to bring the old guys up to speed on all that's new since they were flying jets, while they're struggling to run laps, lift weights and .. oh yes, hang out in the local bars, get in fights and pick up chicks .. give me a break.
And it doesn't, or shouldn't, require hindsight to doubt the realism of a Shuttle full of holes, with failing systems, bulling its way through the atmosphere to a seat of the pants landing by a backup pilot with maybe a couple of runs in the simulator.
I've had some experience with how STS missions run, had small roles in very subsidiary control rooms and watched how both the major and the bit players work, and while excellent special effects give a feeling of verisimilitude to the scenes in space, the overall feel .. the people, the systems .. just does not have the Right Stuff.

1415317,3,B00005ALS2,"One of the most popular films of 2000 is Clint Eastwood's SPACE COWBOYS, a hilarious epic about a group of retired astronauts who are re-assembled to take a decaying Russian satellite out of orbit.
First of all, let me say that there was not one time I was bored throughout this film.  It maintained by utmost attention from start to end - and why wouldn't it?  It has a flawless cast that plays out each of their roles hilariously; another great job by Eastwood as director; an interesting script filled with laughs and questions; and...
Do you really need more than that?!

The space scenes  cinematography/computer graphics are well done and worthy of any good sci-fi picture.

1415319,5,B00005ALS2,"Impressive. Plain and simple.  Clint Eastwood has proved himself, yet again, as a remarkably competent actor and director.  Space Cowboys is both heartfelt and funny.  Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland, and James Garner round out the middle age cast of space-goers assigned to go into orbit to fix an ailing satellite.
Sending this group of retirees in to space was not exactly the perfect plan for NASA.  But Eastwood's character, Frank Corvin, was determined to get Team Datalys in to space after they missed their chance some forty years before.  Jones was great as ""Hawk;"" there was amazing tension but ultimately respect between Frank and Hawk.  Sutherland and Garner were both great additions to the cast as well.  James Cromwell plays a rather fitting NASA naysayer.  The whole of Team Datalys were grounded by this man. . .
It was rather fascinating to see the concept of age in this movie.  It is plausible that Eastwood is himself, feeling his age.  Though it was clear that these gentlemen were quite capable, they knew that the days ahead of them were fewer than the days behind.  Coming to grips with this and living life to the fullest are paramount.
This is a great movie, and a must-have in any DVD collection.

But all are showing a little wear and tear on the leading man image, but they clearly demonstrate they are spark as tacks and still the best.
They are ageing ex-astronauts that never made it into space - a thorn in their sides. Eastwood went on to design guidance systems for the space platform. One of the communication satellite that used his system is decaying and, unfortunately, none of today's hotshots know how to fix it. So the old space cowboys get a second crack to make it into space.

1415339,4,B00005ALS2,"Admit it...we all wanted to go into space when we were kids. We all spent time dreaming of being astronauts and exploring the outer reaches of the galaxy. As time passed, some of us actually succeeded in that dream while most grew up and went on to pursue more realistic dreams. What would you do if you were given that chance now, long after you had given the dream up?
Clint Eastwood's newest production, Space Cowboys, explores that question with hysterical results. Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland, and James Garner were the best team in the Air Force in the late 50s. Jones was the top-notch pilot; Garner was the navigator, Sutherland the engineer, and Eastwood the team leader. Right as it looks as if they are going to get their chance, they are passed over in favor of NASA's newest pilot...a monkey.
The team breaks up and time marches on. Eastwood has long since retired from his job as a technical designer for NASA when his old company gives him an unusual request. They need his help with a Russian Satellite, which has somehow incorporated some of the designs from his SkyLab schematics, which is loosing orbit and will come crashing to earth within the month. Since this is a super communications satellite the Russians are afraid that without it the entire country will be broken down. NASA designers explain that even though he was ahead of his time then, the current crop of scientists and engineers have advanced beyond what he had invented and nobody at NASA could fix the system now.
Eastwood sees this as his final chance and blackmails his old nemesis into sending him and the original team up into space to do the repairs themselves. The rest of the movie shows Eastwood and his teammates trying to get back into some semblance of shape, learning the intricacies of the Space Shuttle, and training for space walks. Eventually the team does end up in space and begins their attempts to fix the satellite.
The plot is slightly silly but works well. At the beginning it is established that all four were second to none and have all kept in some type of similar field. They manage to show that the guys aren't immediately able to do everything needed but as time goes their skills begin to come back. The weakest part of the movie occurs near the very end. This seems to have been one of those where they are going great guns with storyline and then hit a block while trying to figure out the ending.
The stars make this movie. Garner, Eastwood, Sutherland, and Jones live up to the careers that all have achieved. The movie features four old pros getting together and hitting the mark each time. Eastwood plays his team leader as the serious no-nonsense character we are familiar with. Garner is stumbling along as a Preacher with a small flock who takes back the life he had lost. Sutherland is a womanizing roller coaster engineer and Jones flies a stunt plane for tourists. The training sequences would not have worked as well with other actors but these guys leave you laughing with their escapades. It is a toss up as to whether Jones or Sutherland is the funniest character. Both do their best to steal the movie and each one frequently comes close to succeeding.",1018742400,,3204,4.662544169611308

1415363,4,B00005ALS2,"Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland and James Garner, the four stars of Space Cowboys, all have some miles on them. Their average age is sixty-six years. All but Jones, the youngster at fifty-five, are drawing Social Security. That's the bad news. The good news is that rarely has so much experience been gathered together for one movie. In addition to decades in movies, three of them have extensive TV experience. Eastwood is particularly amazing. He has been a star for forty years. He has produced seventeen films, composed the music for seven, and this is the twenty-third movie he has directed. It has some flaws, the main one being that it is too long, but it is his best effort since 1992's Unforgiven. It is most entertaining.
The movie opens back when the American space program was in its infancy. Frank Corwin and Hawk Hawkins [Eastwood and Jones] are part of a team of test pilots. While flying a new jet, Hawk pushes it to the limit, and it begins to break apart. He and Frank safely eject, but the plane is totaled. Apparently they have a knack for doing this, and their boss, Capt. Bob Gerson [James Cromwell] uses this latest incident as a reason for making sure they never become astronauts. Frank holds Hawk responsible for this.
We then switch to the present, and NASA, where Gerson is now an administrator, has a big problem. An old Soviet telecommunications satellite is threatening to come crashing down to earth. NASA learms that the ancient guidance system is one that was stolen from us by the Russians. Gerson discovers another problem. The man who designed the system is Frank Corwin, and he is the only man who can possibly figure out how to fix it. Seizing the opportunity, Frank insists that he and the rest of his old test pilot team be the ones to go into space to fix it. Gerson is forced to agree, and the stage is set for quite an adventure.
The middle of the movie drags a bit because Eastwood spends too much time and energy on jokes about the geriatric set. Such humor has become stale, having been been covered many times before on the screen. Admittedly, Eastwood has endeared himself to audiences by laughing at his own advancing age, but the point about how hard it is for older people to get in shape could have been made in half the time. Once the quartet finally gets into space, the picture turns into a real thriller that is full of peril and surprises. In this part it holds its own against any of the other action-adventure films released last year.
I liked this movie. Obviously older audiences can relate to it, but I think younger ones can also. While kids may not be expected to understand what it is like to be old and supposedly over the hill, they do like to see that dreams do not always go away, that hope really does spring eternal.

1415368,2,B00005ALS2,"""Space Cowboys"" is a geriatric, fantasy version of ""The Right Stuff,"" in which a quartet of aging, retired Air Force pilots are recruited by NASA to go into space and fix a Russian satellite that has fallen out of orbit and is hurtling back to earth at lightning speed (the leader of the operation is the designer of the antiquated system the satellite is using and is, therefore, the only person who, apparently, knows how to fix the problem).  Although the film is heavy on special effects, it really isn't too many DNA strands away from the ""Grumpy Old Men"" comedies, in that here too, we are invited to laugh at the cutesy antics of a bunch of creaky senior citizens trying to act as if they are young again.  To put it politely, a note of condescension hangs heavy over this relatively torpid drama.
I guess enough time has passed since the Challenger disaster to make it okay to use the Space Shuttle as a setting for high, explosive drama, for once the crew finally makes it into outer space, the film turns deadly serious, as the mission's members and an incredibly nave NASA discover that the satellite actually holds a half dozen nuclear warheads aimed directly at key targets in the United States.  Thus, what starts out as a wheezing comedy, filled with folksy clichs and contrived situations, turns into an equally wheezing drama that tries in vain to align itself with the special effects extravaganzas of modern action filmmaking.  It doesn't work.  Despite the impressiveness of some of the visual effects, the pacing in the film's ""action sequences"" is as languid as that in the earthbound scenes.  Moreover, the Space Shuttle setting is both cramped and claustrophobic, leading to a strangely static final act.
Which pretty much leaves us with the characters and the performances.  As the leader of the group, Dr. Frank Corvin, Clint Eastwood gets to pull most of the dramatic weight, leaving James Garner and Donald Sutherland to be little more than ciphers, the former as a simpering, wimpy Baptist minister and the latter as a one-note skirt chaser who spends most of the time trying to hit on any woman who happens to wander through NASA's front door.  Only Tommy Lee Jones' Hawk Hawkins has been given anything close to a personality (though it is pretty well summed up by the name actually).  He and Corvin, of course, have a simmering score to settle and they even manage to engage in that oldest plot device known to this geriatric macho genre - a fistfight at a local saloon (they don't call them space COWBOYS for nothing).  Yet, do we doubt that, in the end, these old fogies will teach those cocky young whippersnappers at NASA a thing or two?
On the positive side, the film does have a few impressive examples of foreshadowing scattered throughout its narrative.  Unfortunately, that is small compensation for a film that is otherwise comprised of equal parts incredibility and predictability.

Lots of Clint Eastwood posturing and acting all tough and melodramatic here.  The title is a confession of the fact that Mr. Eastwood does not know how to do anything but play a cowboy, and that looks pretty silly in modern day costumes after awhile.
Most of the charm of the film is supposed to come from what looks to me like ""reverse ageism,"" if such a thing exists, where old people get to put down people from my generation for supposedly having all knowledge but no spirit. That's what my generation needs, yet another underestimation and put down from the older ones as they tell us how disappointing we are. Yet another attempt of an immature generation (post-world war & pre70s) that has to run around trying to prove it can still be cool, even cooler than the following younger generations--- who it continually tries to tell what is cool. Yes, that is the ideal for aging, not the old finding the dignity, wisdom and strengths of age and helping to guide the young, but rather constantly trying to beat the young. It is not the young that make for the unhealthy and dissatisfying obsession with youth in our culture.
Add to this a paint-by-numbers evil beaurocrat villain, a cause for the mission that is nothing more than a thinly constructed plot device, an awfully bland minister/astronaut character with no genuine religious distinctiveness who is just there to tease himself for being a clergyman or to say the solemn religious word every now and then. He's not here for character development but for the sake of novelty and, who knows, maybe to represent the old geazers who still believe in stuff--vaguely.
Finally there is the uneven and predictable attempt at a ""serious"" ending. Here the film even gets to ape Deep Impact and Armeggedon with a heroic death in space. BUT WITH A TWIST! This time our courageous hero decides to stay and die because he's got cancer anyway. Isn't that nice, the movie has a point after all, when you get old and diseased, it's better just go off and die for the good of society and before you lose one bit of your twenty year old bravado.

1415393,1,B00005ALS2,"This is a terrible movie.  It doesn't contain one original scene.
The movie begins with a flying scene with Tommy Lee Jones and Eastwood meant to establish the conflict between their characters.  They crash because of Jones' crazy flying and Eastwood is mad at him.
The movie switches to a present day scene at NASA where a Russian general tells all of NASA they must stop a satellite from reentering the earth's atmosphere.  Immediately, I think of Deep Impact and Armegeddon, two previous space movies with similar themes.  Throughout the entire movie, I compare Space Cowboys to those two movies because ""Cowboys"" does nothing to deviate from the outline of those movies.
There is no believability factor when Eastwood convinces the NASA guy that his crew of old guys is the only group that can fix the satellite.  Then Eastwood goes to tell each of his old friends, Jones, Donald Sutherland and James Garner that they get to go into space.  Each one of these scenes is suppose to establish the character of each person, but it seems like Eastwood (as writer and director) forced these scenes in from the Armegeddon outline, and didn't come up with anything original.
The training scene at NASA is just like ""Armegeddon"" except it isn't funny at all.  I guess there is supposed to be some conflict with the younger astronauts, but it feels forced and fake.  For some reason, some NASA scientist falls in love with Jones, but the viewer has no idea why.
They finally make it into space where they have to keep a russian satellite from reentering the atmosphere.  Okay, this satellite supposedly has nuclear missles on it armed to shoot US cities if it reenters the atmosphere.  There is no way in the world the Russians could have ever made something like that in the sixties.
Then you have the obligatory scene where that astronaut sacrifices himself to save the world.  No one sheds a tear as Jones straps himself to the sattelite and the others blast it to the moon.  I have no idea how he didn't burn up or why he needed to be attatched to the satellite.
Now they have to return to earth.  Of course, Jones was the only one that could land the shuttle (airplane), and all the computers are down (appollo 13), so Eastwood takes over.  They have the typical reentry scene (""your too steep, Frank!"").  They don't think they are going to make it, so they throw the rest of the crew out so they can parachute to safety (even though one guy is unconcious).  Then they somehow land miracuously and the NASA crowd goes nuts.

It is not an edge-of-your-seat unpredictable thriller, many of the plot twists you can see from far away. It isn't a really deep or a psychologically penetrating film, but if you are looking for a way to spend an evening, you could hardly find a more entertaining, fun film.",997747200,,548,4.6020408163265305

I found it to be a realistic acceptance of the contributions made by age and experience that doesn't in the in any way negate the necessity for young blood and progressive ideas. I think that as they age, actors (and actresses) do themselves and their fans a big favor when they portray older characters. None of us can remain hunks or glamour girls forever and the really intelligent among us have accepted that. A few of the ""older"" movie stars I admire for accepting the fact of age include the four in this movie, Paul Newman, Mickey Rooney, Art Carney, Bette Davis, Shirley McLaine, etal. The list could go on for hours. I've been clammoring after films starring Garner, Newman, Eastwood, etc.; since we were all much, much younger.",997574400,4,860,4.6644736842105265

Of course, it's implausible that these old guys could ever go into space, but that's the fun of the movie! Gosh, if things have to make sense all the time, what a dull world movies would make.
Clint is the coolest of the gang, naturally, and is only concerned with getting up to that Russian satellite and fixing it so it doesn't come crashing down on Earth. No lovey-dovey stuff for him, as he has a good marriage so let's get down to work.
Tommy Lee Jones gets to fall in love and have most of the other good scenes, so that Clint can concentrate.
James Garner has the least to do, but at least he stays out of trouble.  And the biggest single surprise for me? This was the first time I ever liked Sutherland in a movie! He actually did a good job here--only took him twenty-five years.

The premise?  Four old geezers (although 65-70 really isn't that old in the 21st century) who were eliminated from the space program waaay back when, are called back into duty decades later.  The interaction between the former comrades (some of whom had not spoken in many years) was quite funny at points.  (And the choice of cast members aided with this humor).
There is an intriguing espionage element in this picture which could have -- but wasn't -- been exploited quite effectively.  And the ending, while dramatic, needed more resolution.

I am a huge fan of at least three of the main cast (ESPECIALLY a long-time Eastwood fan), and the premise of the film sounded intriguing- former astronauts, years after their last space outing, called to go back in to space again.  Instead I was treated to a tedious two-hour mental torture of which I may never recover from.  Firstly, the film moves way too slow.  I can appreciate a film that takes its time to introduce the lead characters, but come on....this is absolutely ridiculous.  It starts off with about an hour and a half of these four old geezers convincing each other to go into space for the most preposterous reasons followed by endless training sequences.  The script is very weak, and it's obvious from all the hammy and boring dialogue it's filled with as well as all the little sub-plots which end up taking over the film.  It's as if the writers lost sight of the bloody plot near the beginning and started aimlessly trailing off with meaningless dialog and sub-plots, which have no relation to the central plot at all.  95% of the first part of the film is nothing but fluff that you really don't even need to see to understand what's going on.
And then, ... the film suddenly remembers what the plot was all about and makes a very abrupt change into the actual 'space' portion of the film.  What's sad is how hy now I was already half asleep from soaking in the horrible script up until then, and none of it was even necessary to watch.  But at least this part is (a little) better and more fast paced.  However, the plot even takes more unbelievable and ridiculous turns, and the bad dialogue doesn't go away.  Quality-wise it's just the first part of the film on speed.  And then we're treated to, as one of the previous reviewers mention, an Armageddon-esque ending.  It is very cheesy, and very lame.  Typical Hollywood.
This film is nothing but cliche after cliche after cliche.  That's usually not a very bad thing (especially in these days with the public's lower standards for films), but the film is plagued with some of the worst dialogue I have ever seen in a film, and the plot moves at a bloody slow pace.  It's only ""high points"" are the great special effects near the end and the superb performances from the likes of Clint Eastwood and Donald Sutherland and so on.  The last 5-star reviewer was right- the reviewers of this film do fall in to two categories.  What he doesn't have right is what those categories really are- those who know when to hit the eject button, and those who don't.",995328000,2,2601,4.505330490405117

1415413,1,B00005ALS2,"Note: this review is spoiler-free.
My father and I, who I watched this with, both had high hopes for the movie, although we didn't know much about it.  It has a GREAT cast of talented actors, and for all we knew was about ""space flight"".  By the end of the second act, we both agreed that this was turning in to one of the worst, most boring movies we had seen in years.  From there on, it got both better and worse, speeding up the pace but ultimately hurting what was already a tedious movie.
Oh where to start.  It's hard to decide, since I cannot think of one thing this movie even did right.  How 'bout the dialogue- it can only be described as cheesy and hammy.  It almost never adds anything to the plot, and half the time (mostly during the second act) rates quite high on the cheese-o-meter.  Sitting there with my father, who happens to be one who appreciates a well-written movie, it was almost embarrasing to sit through it.  The plot was dragging at an extremely slow pace, muddled with weak sub-plots (which seemed to want to turn in to the main plot due to the weakness of the actual plot, hurting it even more); the movie just seems to go on forever before you really figure out where it's trying to go.
Then suddenly, as if the writers realized the script was becoming tediously slow and boring, the movie completely changes gear in to one big fast-paced space action scene.  None of it relates to the rest of the movie in any way, making you regret even watching the first two ""acts"", and making the third ""act"" seem as if it totally came out of left field.  But even this part of the movie is badly written and terribly cliched, and ultimately disappointing.  And then at the very end, they pull an Armageddon on us.  Utterly sappy, and hardly any moral ambiguity about it.  Just a cheap way to end the movie.
Seeing as how this movie has quite a few decent-to-good reviews, it's hard for me to honestly say you *won't* enjoy the movie.  But I honestly cannot understand how anybody could find enjoyment in this sappy, slow-paced, tedious and awefully-written movie with one of the most under-developed ambiguous plots I've ever had the misfortune of experiencing..  It simply has no artistic merit whatsoever as a film.

Part Magnificent Seven, part Right Stuff, part Armageddon, part Mission to Mars...this flick is entertaining, even if Clint Eastwood isn't the greatest F/X director around.  And yes, the ""get the gang back together"" schtick isn't the freshest, but it's perfect for a flick where we get to see Eastwood, Donald Sutherland, James Garner and Tommy Lee Jones banter wryly off one another while sweating and puffing their way into a spaceflight to save the world.
Of course, it would have been easier to ask some geek at MIT to pull up a small program he created on his TRS-80 computer back in junior high that would have reset the satellite, but then we wouldn't get to see these guys mug it up.  We wouldn't get to see Tommy Lee Jones hit on a woman half his age, Eastwood gripe about age discrimination, James Cromwell pose and preen like the archetypical Washington bureaucrat, or Sutherland seduce anything in a skirt.  Of course, all James Garner has to do is talk to the people and he's all right in my book.  That drawl says it all.
Its a dream camp for middle agers who were ready to go to space when that gig was young and hot, but who can only look back on those glory days and lost hope of being the first man to rocket himself to the moon on a thermonuclear warhead.

In fact, it's pretty much what you would expect given the cast. It's surprising to find Eastwood directing something like this. In fact, this is referred to a bit in the DVD features. The requirements of making a special effects movie (like CGI) don't sound like they would fit well with Eastwood's directing style which tends to have an almost exclusive focus on actors and story (and possibly a less than obsessive attention to detail). In other words, in making this kind of movie the work goes slowly and Eastwood likes to work quickly. But as it turns out, this is actually one of the better special effects movies, possibly because they generally take a back seat to the story.
If you want to see a movie that is simply fun, moves quickly (great editing) and particularly if you like Eastwood or Tommy Lee Jones, this movie is great. But don't expect to see 2001: A Space Odyssey or the Seven Samurai.",992649600,3,1046,4.5396825396825395

The plot revolves around a crisis in space that is triggered when a Russian satellite malfunctions and is due to collide with Earth in densely populated areas, unless someone can repair it in space. The problem is that the technology on the satellite is obsolete and no one knows how to tackle it except the inventor of that technology, retired Air Force pilot Frank Corvin, played by Clint Eastwood.

Corvin agrees to do so, but only on condition that he and his top gun crew of forty odd years ago go into space to do it themselves. Having been kicked out of the space program in 1958, he wants an opportunity for them to do what they had come so close to doing in the past. NASA agrees, but only if this now geriatric quartet can pass the physical. Their preparation for their big moment provides some laughs, as they ultimately prove themselves the physical equal of their younger counterparts and exceed them in experience and wisdom.

Permission for them to go into space is reluctantly granted, but much to their consternation, they ultimately realize they have been sold a bill of goods. Not only has NASA not been dealing in good faith with them, but they eventually discover that a much more serious problem than a satellite malfunction exists. Unfortunately, they do not discover it until they are out in space.

What happen in space will keep the viewer glued to his or her seat. There is action, pathos, tension, and heroics. It is a film that says that one is never too old for adventure.",992390400,34,1737,4.614886731391586
1415441,5,B00005ALS2,"Clint Eastwood. Tommy Lee Jones. Donald Sutherland. James Garner. That's the way to start a movie. The movie starts out showing the guys as young men in 1958. They main goal is to become the first men in space, but after crashing their 3rd test plane in 10 months, they find out that another agency, NASA, has been givin' that job. The movie then fastforwards to the present. A Soviet satelite is getting ready to come down, but the Soviets are pushing to make sure that it stays in orbit because it is their only communication satelite. The engineers can't figure out how to get that technology to work as it is outdated. So they go to get help from the creator who happens to be Clint Eastwood. After initially turning them down because of his hatred for their superior (you'll find out why when you watch this movie), he finally agrees to help. His idea is to send him and his 3 buddies up. The catch is they have to pass the physicals and all other test that all other astronauts would to qualify. This is filled with Clint & Tommy Lee's characters constantly competing against one another which is hilarious throughout. Pretty soon, they are on talk shows and in newspapers everywhere and are making NASA popular again. But before they get to go up, one the crew is diagnosed with cancer. After some arguing, in which Clint believes his ""enemy"" is trying to keep him from going to space again, he finds out that the Vice President is insistent that they are sent into space to fix the satelite. And this is where it gets really exciting. With excellent acting, some great comedy in the beginning, and super special effects, this movie is a keeper. They constantly are making fun of their age and continually beat the odds. They also have an extended version from the movie of the guys on Jay Leno's show. It's pretty funny.

Sounds like a great story full of symbolism and sub-text.  But the rich thematic elements are undermined by a weak script, sub-par performances and poor direction.
>The action scenes were confusing and left me bewildered about what was happening.  A preamble set in the 1950s clumsily uses black and white, lots of shadows and voice overdubbing to portray the protagonists as young men.  It was pretty obvious.

If you are willing to suspend some belief for a little while this is an entertaining, fun film.  The movie is divided into two parts.  The first being an hilarious take on the training before the mission format of  Full Metal Jacket or Armageddon but with senior citizens.  There is some subplot with the villainous James  Cromwell character which seemed a little unnecessary, but wasn't as distracting as it could have been.  The  introduction is interesting but I found the dubbed voices of the older actors on to the young actors a little  gimmicky.  The training scenes are absolutely hilarious with the prerequisite scenes of the older more clever  Clint Eastwood and crew outwitting the young ""punks"".  There is definite chemistry between the four stars.
The second part of the story concerns the disarming of an ancient satellite carrying nuclear missiles.  The movie  shifts gears and turns less humorous.  I found it to be exciting and I was caught up in the action.  The ending is  touching but not maudlin.
This movie was compared to Armageddon when it was released but there is only a superficial resemblance.

Tommy Lee Jones- stick to movies you're good at like THE FUGITIVE and MEN IN BLACK.  Stay away from these kinds of movies.  And what is this business with you and that 25 year old chick???
Another point- They were only in space for 20 minutes of the 130 minute movie...
Eastwood- you can make UNFORGIVEN, star in THE GOOD BAD AND THE UGLY and even star in IN THE LINE OF FIRE, but you aren't a SPACE COWBOY!!!!  This movie fails everywhere!
There is no excitment in this movie!  There isn't much humor in this movie (except for the scene with TOMMY LEE JONES and the crazed teen who wanted a death-rush joyride on his birthday), the acting wasn't the best, the backround set for space stunk, and the movie was just too darn long to be this bad!!!

The end of this movie reminded me too much of Armageddon which is not a bad thing but it is almost like a copy how Tommy Lee Jones sacricficed his life to save earth, I saw that story 2 years ago, overall good film for Eastwood fans and movie fans in general.",988675200,,619,4.141666666666667
1415466,4,B00005ALS2,"I expected nothing from this film and found myself liking it immensely.  That is due to the charisma of the 4 stars playing old poops finally getting their chance to go into space after having been cheated out of it when they were young. (I loved the opening with the F-15 type jet tearing-up the stratosphere).
Cut to today and there is some cockamamy reason why these guys have to go up in the Shuttle to fix a Russian satellite.  Great fun is made of their age in training and this first half of the film hooked me.
It lets down somewhat in the space segment of the back half of the film, but Clint Eastwood is not a director to waste time and he moves quickly through the plot points and dilemmas, so I didn't lose interest.
I was somewhat disappointed with how low-key and detached he handled Tommy Lee Jones' situation in space, but he redeemed all of that with the closing shot.  ""Fly me to the moon and let me play among the stars...""
It's just entertainment, and it was a lot of fun with some old pros. 3-1/2 to 4 stars depending on your mood.",988588800,7,1052,4.276381909547739

One I was ready to see coming from these guys.  BUT.........it was a drama with with a FEW light hearted  clips.....the further along you got the more serious it got.  The whole this disapointed me.....the last 20 mins. of the film was the best of the whole thing.  It should of been a WHOLE lot better with a strong cast like this......I ""expected"" way more that i got.",988588800,,509,4.195876288659794
1415468,4,B00005ALS2,"For pure entertainment value, this is one of the better films of 2000.  Although the plot is contrived and derivative, the comedy is endearing and the four veteran actors are as brilliant as they have ever been.  From a directorial standpoint, Clint Eastwood is excellent, wringing as much comedy, adventure and suspense as could be imagined from the screenplay and the cast.  I was particularly impressed with the realism of the space scenes.  The weightlessness is beautifully choreographed, and the visual effects, especially for the EVA's, are stunningly realistic.
The acting in this film is wonderful.  Each of the four leads gives his part something unique and special.  Clint Eastwood provides toughness, James Garner gives it charm, Donald Sutherland offers mischievous humor and Tommy Lee Jones adds audacity.  You can't help but cheer for these guys, even though it is easy to predict how things will turn out.  James Cromwell and William Devane round out an experienced cast playing their straight dramatic roles to perfection.  The Jay Leno interview is a scream, the climax of which is an infinitely funny line by Donald Sutherland.
There isn't a lot to say about this film except see it.  I rated it an 8/10.  It is great fun and highly entertaining.",988329600,4,1265,5.033653846153846

1415478,2,B00005ALS2,"Right from the start where the voices didn't quite match the faces of the pilots I was weary. Things got worse. All the way though, I kept thinking the director wasn't up to the job. Compare the gung-honess of Armageddon with this? You can't, there wasn't any gung-honess. All the space action passed by without so much as a triumphant fanfare, or any cheering from mission control. It was just too loose. After and hour and forty-five minutes I grabbed the DVD box to see which director was responsible for ruining what should have been a cracker. Uh-oh, how could I have not known. It was Clint himself. Doh!  Oh and after it was over I suddenly realised that I couldn't remember 1 note from the score. There might as well have not been one. Still there were 4 top notch actors to watch!

1415480,1,B00005ALS2,"Watching ""Space Cowboys"" was like watching a train wreck happening in slow motion.  I only sat through it by a perverse fascination with seeing how bad it could get.
Seriously.  This is really bad.",987811200,12,197,4.764705882352941
1415481,3,B00005ALS2,"Clint Eastwood trying to save the world in outer space?  Great! Or so I thought until watching this movie.  While the movie was pretty entertaining with some good acting and special effects, it truly lacked many things that make different movies original and good.
  When I first sat down to watch this seemingly full blown space drama and action extravaganza, I was thinking: Excellent!  It's the next Apollo 13!  Don't get me wrong, it was a good script, right up until the part where it ceased to be Apollo 13 and slid into becoming more like the Hollywood blowout, Armageddon.  There were indeed many accurate belivable parts of the movie, and some not so believable parts.
  The storyline starts out with a flashback of 1958 when Clint Eastwood and the boys were young, flying supersonic planes as test pilots. All of them were beaten away of their dreams of going into space by the rise of the National Areonautics and Space Administration (NASA).  Forty years down the road, NASA wants Frank Corvin (Eastwood) to help them send a falling Russian satalite back into geosincronous orbit around the earth.  Eventually they strike up a deal where the original four person test pilot team gets to go into space-- mainly because of Frank's expertice in the satalite's design (his design) and the short amount of time they have before the satalite re-enters the earth's atmosphere.  Pending tough physical training, they eventually do get to go into space and attempt to fix the satalite (really old test pilots this time in liu of oil drillers).  When they make it into space though, they learn that the mission the're on is not all it's cracked up to be, for a few interesting reasons...  To summarize, in light of the low character developement and a few over used Hollywood scenarios, it was an okay movie.
  I recommend this movie to: Anyone who liked Armageddon, anyone who liked Apollo 13, or anyone who wants to see Clint Eastwood go into space (he's still a great actor!).",987811200,5,1981,4.7823529411764705
1415482,3,B00005ALS2,"I'd have more to say against this movie if I thought it had been meant to be taken seriously. Most of the old guy stuff was all right although ""He's dead now"" seemed to come up pretty often. I kind of liked the way these guys didn't rely on computers to get things done, cheated on eye exams, lots of other details. They had a lot of help from NASA and it shows everywhere, that combined with ILM space scenery made this movie really something to watch. I had wondered how an American could repair an old Soviet satellite, turns out the KGB stole his design work. The Russian satellite was the worst part of the movie, big as MIR or SKYLAB and we didn't know about it or the nukes in it? I could accept the young hothead doing things his own way on repairs and almost getting them all killed but I'd think that beating would kill a shuttle, not just cripple it. I also question the ability of a 40 year out of date pilot with little training being able to land the barely functional thing. Tommy Lee Jones riding the nukes to the moon to get rid of them was very noble, having enough air to get there is left unexplained.",987724800,,1121,4.21860465116279
1415483,3,B00005ALS2,"Totally likable film.  Tommy Lee Jones and the boys were just wonderful.  Always wanted to know the reaction to those test-flight jockeys who were turned down by the space program in favor of a monkey.  Watch their reactions, especially the actor portraying Eastwood...priceless!
For all of us who grew up with NASA this is a warm-hearted, salute to its pioneers and today's space scientists.
The references to well-known space travellers: Shepard, Glenn and of course Yeager was much appreciated.",987724800,,497,5.265822784810126
1415484,3,B00005ALS2,"As a big fan of the space program, I had pretty high expectations for this film. Sadly, after watching, I came away feeling vaguely dissapointed. Like another reviewer suggested, there seemed to be something missing. I watched a summer action movie when I was expecting a more tight knit drama. Maybe I've just seem Apollo 13 too many times. I just couldn't form any sort of emotional attachment to these characters which frankly is a real shame. We've got way too many 'action stars' in Hollywood films these days, and not nearly enough heros. Surely with over two hours screen time the plot could have been tigher and the subject matter a more epic quality. I won't even go into the various plot holes. Int he real world, NASA and Russian space officials would probably be sacked, or perhaps deported for some of the things they pulled.
 Still, it's not all bad. Watching such great veteran actors chew each scene is sheer joy, and worth the price of admission, although Garner and Sutherland seem to take a backseat to the films two 'big name' stars. The rest of the cast does a fine with the material onhand.  The special effects are of course stunning, ILM's usual high standards. And of course as I said being a NASA fan, I loved the Space shuttle launch and landing footage. But then, I could watch that sort of thing all day.
 All in all it's a fine film. The DVD features excellent sound and picture quality along with several well done behind the scenes documentaries. A commentary would've been nice, but I suppse we can't have everything.
 I guess the problem is perhaps I was expecting too much.",987724800,,1608,4.631578947368421
1415485,2,B00005ALS2,"Let me say something to begin.  Clint Eastwood is a very talented director and actor.  I have loved his other ventures, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil and True Crime.  Both were excellent.  This one on the other hand was something else.  The beginning of Space Cowboys was good.  Funny.  It has some great star power in the means of James Garner, Tommy Lee Jones, and Donald Sutherland.  All are great actors and they made a few good jokes in this film.  After the first half, which mainly deals with these older gentlemen trying to get back into shape to go into space, the second half is too dramatic.  It stands out way too much than the first half and leaves you with a, ""Why did I just watch this"", kind of feeling.  That is just my opinion, but you might want to reconsider buying this one.  It is one to watch though.",987465600,,833,4.303225806451613
1415486,3,B00005ALS2,"What can be said of a movie in which four geezers are shot into space?  The sheer premise alone just about says it all: ""Armageddon"" with old folk.
There's the whole theme of resentment from the younger, ""better-fit,"" hotshots.  The ""fighting team-mates"" theme (which, of course, means that one of them must die).  There's even the ""fledgeling-romance-on-Earth"" theme!
Yes, we've seen all this before, but somehow it all seems to work this time around.  How could that be?  I would give a lot of credit to the performances of, of course, Eastwood, Sutherland, Garner, and Jones.  These guys realize that, to some extent, this film is the story of their careers.  (If only Harrison Ford had been available!)  So they sit back, gear up the punchlines, and let the metaphor work for them.
All in all, this is a bit of a mixed bag, but it's worth checking out, if only to laugh along with the geezers.",986256000,4,897,4.6687898089171975
