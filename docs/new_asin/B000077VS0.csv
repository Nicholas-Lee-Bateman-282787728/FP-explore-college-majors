1801873,4,B000077VS0,"The French are masters of subtlety and here's another film that proves it.  Vincent, a quiet family man, keeps up the appearance of having his job to make his family--wife and three kids--feel secure with him.  But there is another force working at Vincent, inside him and it is just as powerful, if not more so, in his game-playing.
He is in thrall to his father, a wealthy businessman who, thanks to his great success, has been able to not only raise Vincent well but also psychologically tie a noose around his neck his entire life.  Although this does not seem to be a major theme, it becomes crystal clear near the end of the film.  Vincent's own ""success"" is a mockery of his father's as he scams people left and right, lies to those he knows and loves, and engages in criminal activity.
This subtle display of familial dysfunction is a brilliant psychological character study and for that reason alone, makes this a film worth not only watching but owning.  It's possible not too many others will have this interpretation of the film, but from my perspective, that's what it is.
Highly recommended.",1088985600,6,1105,4.675257731958763
1801874,4,B000077VS0,"Vincent is on a route where he is out driving trying to find something, while hiding that he has been laid off from his family.  The anxiety of displaying failure to his family and parents seems to be overwhelming for Vincent and he begins to pretend that he has quit his job for a better job in Switzerland.  Through his idea of lying about his newly acquired job, he is lead astray from reality, and he must cover his lies by providing the necessary means for his family.  He does so by scamming his acquaintances and friends for large amounts of money.  In return, he offers a large profit through his pretend job, however, this is overheard by a man in a hotel lobby.  This man interferes with Vincent's plan, but in return he finds a new profitable business through this stranger.  During this, Vincent is struggling with to keep his family happy and content, but the wife begins to smell a rat.  Time Out is an intriguing slow paced thriller about a man's pride and his search for happiness, which provides well developed characters and ingenious cinematography that enhances the quality of the film.  Ultimately, the audience is provided well-rounded story that is presented through an astounding cinematic experience.",1050796800,10,1225,4.8
1801875,5,B000077VS0,"Vincent is an average working stiff family man who suddenly lose his job. Finding another job is not really the problem, something deeper than unemployment is troubling this man.  His old job so consumes him, yet at the same time is so meaningless to him, that he panicks and become slightly unhinged.  He doesn't tell his family, and pretend to be still working, spending his days driving around the country side, sitting in parks.  Gradually, he descend into moral seediness.
What's disturbing is that this guy has a very loving family and good, decent friends. It's the man's relationship with his work that's troubling.  The movie didn't really come together for me until the very last shot, where the themes of the movie that bubbled under the surface rise up in the subtle emotions of his face as a quiet trap close over him.
Some people may say, ""Well, he is bored with his job, so what?  Many of us are!""  But I think that's merely the surface of what he is going through. He is a lost man desperately searching for meaning and passion in life.  In that aspect, his struggles are like many of our daily struggles amplified, and deserve our sympathy.",1043971200,8,1157,4.642156862745098
1801876,5,B000077VS0,"My girlfriend and I went to go see this movie a bit ago at an International Film Festival here in Minneapolis, not knowing what the movie was about, or who was in it. Although she hated, I absolutely loved it! The story revolves around a man, Vincent, who loses his job and doesn't have the courage to tell his family. To cover for his failure, he concocts an outrageous story about a new job he has gotten for the United Nations, and as the film progresses, we watch as his life goes into a downward spiral. Perhaps the most impressive aspect of this film is the fact that it is truly realistic, both in dealing with the idea of failure and the idea of hopelessness. It's painful to watch, as Vincent wastes away his days doing nothing, while calling his wife to tell her that work is going great, yet at the same time, we can identify with his situation. Pride is one of the greatest human flaws, and the film expertly examines it. Overall, a great film, one that I strongly recommend. Action fans, though, will be very disappointed, as it is truly a character examination piece.",1043798400,4,1081,4.4646464646464645
1801887,4,B000077VS0,"I saw this film on a total whim one day when I was walking around downtown in my local city and it happened to be playing at a local theatre which is known to show more off-beat and foreign films.  It was quite an unexpected pleasant surprise to come across this film because I don't usually watch many foreign films.

This film really touched a chord with me as I feel that my personality is very similar to Vincent in the film.  I've been fired from jobs so many times due to circumstances completely beyond my control due to situations in my life.  I know the feeling of having an ego and wanting to pretend everything is working out fine to your friends when in reality you're really up-the-creek.  So you end up creating an elaborate cover for yourself and keep burying yourself deeper.  I just had to purchase a copy of this film.  This is one of those personal films for me that I don't really think any of my friends or family members would understand the appeal of.",1197676800,4,974,4.377777777777778
1801888,3,B000077VS0,"I should point out that I don't know French at all, and that I watched this film with subtitles. This can in theory be to blame for my claim that ""Time Out"" does not really build the quiet tension as affectively as it tries to be. Perhaps this is because I have encountered more than one career pretender in the workplace and cannot sympathize. I rented ""Time Out"" because of its presence on few critical Top Ten lists and it is well made.

Recoing plays a senior-level manager who has been released from his job in finance. He drives around France and Switzerland to keep away from his wife and family, who grow suspicious of him. His schemes include scamming associates, who are desperate to invest their money (as many well-off Europeans do) in ways invisible to the local tax collectors. Despite his good status at his old job, he lacks real knowledge about global finance (basic concepts, really) and has to siphon what he can from inside an office building. His growing alienation from his wife (played by Viard) becomes a central theme of the film; this relationship is excellently conveyed by the two actors.

The plausiblity of the plot is 100%, the principal acting is perfect and the pacing is consistent throughout the film. So why is ""Time Out"" not as entertaining as ""Fargo,"" about another white-collar scammer buried under his own lies, or ""Glengarry Glen Ross,"" about toxic competition between salesmen? Maybe some of the subtlety is lost across the Atlantic: there are immense differences between American and European work cultures.  Maybe I missed some things (Ebert wrote that the wife had suspicions about his actual job before the firing, but I didn't pick that up). Maybe unemployment is just not as big of a deal in the social state of France, and anxiety over not having a job seems a little out of place to me. My suspicion is that the subplots involving the children and family members detract, rather than supplement, the main story. Weak members of the cast abound, and its hard to distinguish intentional awkwardness from unintentional awkwardness.

Recommended for the patient viewer, but I prefer the Belgian film ""Rosetta,"" a story about desperate unemployment with its own subtle elements.",1137456000,2,2223,4.888594164456234
1801889,4,B000077VS0,"When I scanned the blurb on the cover of this DVD I thought that this film was a dramatization of the story of Frenchman Jean-Claude Romand from the book The Adversary: A True Story of Monstrous Deception (2000) written by novelist and screen writer Emmanuel Carrre.  However, Carrre did not write the screen play for L'Emploi du temps, nor is the story in the film the same or even close to ""A True Story of Monstrous Deception.""

True, Vincent, the central character, does practice a deception, but it is hardly monstrous.  In fact it is so ordinary and banal that many viewers may find it boring.

The film opens with a man pretending to be working while in fact he is just driving around in his car, talking on his cellphone and telling his wife lies about where he is and what he is doing.

What is going on?

I won't say anymore because part of the effectiveness of this very subtle film stems from not knowing why Vincent is driving around pretending to be working.  If you haven't seen the film I recommend that you not read any reviews on it until you have, because it is difficult to write a review of this film without revealing something that will spoil it for the viewer.  If I had known what Vincent's predicament was prior to viewing, I don't think the film would have held my interest as well as it did.

So let me compliment the director, Laurent Cantet, on his fine direction, make note of the interesting and professional camera work, and the fine acting by Aurlien Recoing who plays the lead with excellent support from Karin Viard as his wife, Muriel, and Serge Livrozet who plays a mysterious petty criminal.  And let me add that the theme of the film involves the fear of failure and the dehumanization of life within the modern corporate structure, and that it is replete with the sort of vacuous dialogue heard in corporate biz-speak in which vague but seemingly impressive generalities are bandied about in lieu of saying anything specific for fear of giving away too much information.

In a sense this is a dismaying satire of the business world, to be compared (distantly) to such films as In the Company of Men (1997)--a sociopathic study within the corporate structure--and  David Mamet's striking Glengarry Glen Ross (1992).

I had mixed feelings about the resolution of the film (which of course I will keep vague).  It seemed that the movie could have ended the scene before, the haunting scene in which we hear the voice of Vincent's wife on the cellphone telling him she loves him while we see him walking away from the headlights of his Renault van over the snow toward the blackness of the night.  If the film had ended with that scene how different would our experience have been!  I wonder if originally that was indeed the ending, with the other ending an afterthought.  How different our understanding of Vincent the man would be depending on which ending we experience.

Of course if you haven't seen the film, this is way too vague, but I mention the endings because when you do watch the film you might think about how the ending effects the story and our understanding of the film.  Most of the time for me the ending doesn't matter that much.  It's the treatment and the development of the story and the theme, the artistry of the players and the camera work and the direction that count.  Endings sometimes are even arbitrary.  In this film however the ending is important.

See this for Aurlien Recoing who elicits our empathy over the course of a long and demanding role.",1135123200,2,3520,4.62379421221865
1801890,5,B000077VS0,"Vincent has a wonderful wife and three kids, a nice house, a decent car and everything else to be considered a successful person. He also has a wonderful job in Switzerland in one of UN's sections, or has he? At least that's what he tells everybody accepting his wife. In reality he's got fired from his last job several months ago and was afraid to tell. Now he's lying more and more constructing rather shaky and fragile plot of his occupation.

This brilliant film everybody is talking to be long and boring isn't that at all. For two hours I couldn't get my eyes off of the screen just like I was watching some thriller. Well, it is a thriller except there are no guns, chases and murders here. It's a thriller from our everydays life and therefore may be close to many. It is unbearable to see the agony of this man, who's a good husband and father, who's kind and sensitive person, but we know that those lies are like cancer - when you know the diagnosis it's already not a matter of whether you'll stay alive or not, but of how much time is left. We know and Vincent knows that soon everything will surface but he can't do anything about it. And therefore even more tragic is the outcome when we see everyone is ready to help and forgive, because it emphasizes one more time a man's loneliness in our world. We don't know the people we live among, we are afraid and don't know what to expect, we are not sure if we're loved... And one of this movie's messages - if you are in trouble - just reach out your hand, there are people who are ready to give you theirs.

""Time Out"" is a brilliant, intense drama with excellent directing and outstanding acting. You won't regret if you buy it. Definately one of the best films I've seen during the last year.",1129420800,4,1758,4.340425531914893
1801891,2,B000077VS0,"Ok, it is boring..... ~ 1 hour of watching a guy drive around?  please.....

But it is also intriguing.  What makes this guy ""tick""?  How will he resolve this mess he's created.

No masterpiece, no bomb, but interesting in a thoughtful (not action) way",1125014400,,252,4.636363636363637
1801892,5,B000077VS0,"Disturbing character study appropriately shot with the style and feel of a docu-drama, the movie explores a universal truth- our innate fear of failing- both to ourselves and to others. There are those who may do virtually anything not to acknowledge it. A mesmerizing, cautionary tale.",1124755200,3,286,5.239130434782608
1801893,4,B000077VS0,"While I don't think ""Time Out"" is quite the four-star masterpiece depicted on the cover box of the US DVD release, it is a spooky, worthwhile viewing that ought to make any member of the labor force more than a little uneasy.

Underacheiver Vincent (finely played by French theater actor Aurlien Recoing) drifts slowly to the edges of working society.  Suddenly unemployed, he tries to keep the secret from his wife.  Think of this small lie as a snowball tumbling down the top of a hill - in no time Vincent has a series of stories spun from whole cloth he has to keep in the air, like plates he has to keep spinning at the end of poles...working for the UN, some half-baked investment scheme, a new car on borrowed money.  The whole thing is very unsettling because it's completely plausible to see how Vincent has step by step fallen into this abyss.

The ending here isn't the strongest resolution in the world...sort of a cop-out really.  And, for this reason, I don't think 'Time Out' is the great undiscovered French movie that you'll rave to friends about.  *That* movie is Jacques Audiard's ""Read My Lips"" with Vincent Cassel and Emmanuelle Devos.  That's the best movie you've never seen.",1121299200,,1198,4.671428571428572
1801894,5,B000077VS0,"Have you ever been in the hard situation of having been fired after a magnificent social status?

That is the relevant question of that smart and intelligent movie: the responsible father of a relatively media class family is out of game. And he will make all what he can to apparent nothing has happened creating the illusion of normality during seven months until the true finally appears.

The fertile creativity of such engaging script will keep you hold on your seat till the end.

Overwhelming acting of our Aurelien Recoing and the rest of the cast works out in the same level.",1114905600,,584,4.705882352941177
1801895,5,B000077VS0,"When Vincent--a tall, quiet, morose middle-aged man--is fired from his job, he finds himself unexpectedly cut loose from society and set adrift from life as he knows it.  Instead of looking for a job, he casually cons some family and friends out of substantial chunks of money in order to support his wife and three children while he spends week after week driving through the European countryside in winter.  A subdued but inescapable tension builds for the audience as we continually fail to understand what motivates Vincent to risk so much, and this tension becomes only more profound when we realize that Vincent himself does not understand his actions.  ""Time Out"" is a hypnotically sad story told at a measured, melancholy pace with a haunting musical score that circumscribes Vincent's strange, incomprehensible mystery.",1093305600,13,828,5.2105263157894735
1801896,1,B000077VS0,"'Time Out' is a typical French film in that nothing much happens. It is at first a relief not to be confronted with explosions, shootings, computer-generated aliens, or the other staples of Hollywood films. There is, however, nothing of substance to hold one's attention. After two hours of watching the lead character wander around trying to convince others (perhaps even himself) that he has something 'big' in the works, I finally screamed at the screen. ENOUGH ALREADY! It's simply BORING and LONG. Perhaps the director is trying to communicate to us the feeling of hopelessness and restlessness that the unemployed main character is experiencing. That's just what we need: the cinematic equivalent of waiting in the unemployment line. No thank you!

Those who are about to snore salute you!!!

7974215,3,B000077VS0,to the economic times the world is going through.  Middle aged men are often terrified of starting a new career from scratch and this story shows the lengths one man will go to save face in front of his family and friends.  I like that he wasn't a victim and that perhaps this was a phase he had to go through.  It's a little depressing for my tastes though.,1353888000,,358,4.159420289855072
7974216,4,B000077VS0,"This film deals with a number of things that most men face in their lives. Sure, you could be nasty & say some vile things about the French in particular, but the fact is that men in the US can also see themselves at least to a certain extent in the main character of this film. Getting fired is not an extraordinary thing, it can happen to most anyone, & doesn't mean that you're a loser. I was warned by a woman who was my boss to beware of women bosses - they could be very vindictive, she told me. She was prophetic in what she said, later I was fired by a woman who succeeded her, & it was an act of vindictiveness. Well, that was not the only time I was fired. In this film, Vincent makes some very wrong choices, & has to eat humble pie as a result. In the end he tells his family that at least he did not desert them, & he was right about that. I gave the film 3 stars because I liked it - then another because it was very well made, written, acted, & directed.",1352851200,,969,3.9489795918367347
7974217,3,B000077VS0,"This is a mid-life crisis that is not triggered by some tragic event but by the overwhelming inability to keep caring.  Vincent's apathy in his professional life slowly unravels one thread after another until he is practically asking to be fired.

When his passive aggressive non-strategy invokes the reaction he desperately craves, he is at a loss as to how to deal with it.  He still desperately wants to enjoy the lifestyle his job enabled, he just does not want to, you know, actullay do the job.

This takes him down a strange road where he realizes that he has to decide how he will deal with the issues that he has created.  Vincent finds a a few options but, perhaps not surprisingly, the one he does not explore is changing his consumer/material life to be in accord with his new corporate-refugee circumstances.

The final banal choice made by Vincent is the most realistic of all.  And for that, is is the most depressing knowing what we know about Vincent.

As with seemingly every great French film, this one is 30 minutes too long.  If I have to include the disclaimer ""you may want to tap the FF button on the remote, but it's still a great film!"", then it drops to 3 stars no matter how much I enjoyed it and recommend it.",1342396800,,1238,4.491071428571429
7974218,4,B000077VS0,"Spoiler Alert (This review contains spoilers): There is a subtle and dreamlike quality to this movie: a haunting and sad tale of a man truly disenchanted with life and the system. Vincent (played with a quiet strength by Aurlien Recoing), on the surface, lives an idyllic life we all aspire to achieve. He has a loving wife and three children, owns a comfortable home in a good community, and has plenty of friends and family near reach. But, underneath it all, he's living a lie. Unable to tell his wife and family the cold hard truth of his recent unemployment, he fabricates a bountiful and busy life, calling his wife from the road between meetings and informing her of his many business affairs. However, as you can imagine, without gainful employment, money is running low. This is where the lies take on a more sinister tone. In desperation, Vincent chalks up a loan from his father for a fake purchase of a house in Switzerland, where he deceptively states he will need to relocate during the week for a new job he has landed with the United Nations. In order to repay the loan, he begins a Ponzi scheme, victimizing close friends and associates. But the lies and deceit do not fool everyone, and a clever black market business man takes pity on Vincent and offers him temporary employment. But Vincent can't restrain the lies, which are spiraling out of control, causing rifts between him and his family as they grow suspicious of his odd behavior. Predictably and inevitably the truth makes its way to the surface, and Vincent is confronted by his family, and, miraculously, is given a second chance. Forced by his father (a man of influence), to interview for a normal job, the very idea of returning to a normal life proves to be an impossibility, for as the camera closes in on Vincent, we can glean from his expression that it is only a matter of time before he will make a mad dash for his auto and drive off again... running away from the intolerable banality of his existence. And, in those final stirring and chilling moments, we are left with the hapless dread that this man will never be happy... and to wonder how many of us are also like Vincent?",1337472000,5,2168,4.604651162790698

7974220,2,B000077VS0,"Evidently getting fired or laid off in France is more traumatic than in the US, judging by this film in which a man is so freaked that he can't tell his family he's jobless. Instead, he kills time hanging around and eventually sinks to selling counterfeit goods with a semi-crook. In the end, he gets a new white collar job. More than two hours of moody non-action. You're never quite sure what's going on, but actually very little is. I don't understand the great reviews.

I don't know where people get off giving this four or five stars for, this movie reminds one of the work of a film school student who came up with half of a good idea and successfully pitched it but when it came to finishing the story ran out of poop.  The movie starts off promisingly; a man is fired from a career job and to hide this from his family concocts a story about being hired to an important position at the UN, and a scheme to swindle his family, acquaintances and business associates so that he can afford to live the lie presumably until he lands on his feet.  Alas the promise of the story is strangled by the numerous sections of the film filled tedious, over-wrought and downright tawdry sections of nothing but morose music and rather pointless shots of the protagonist driving, or walking or thinking or sitting.  Meanwhile the audience is yawning or fidgeting or groaning or snoozing.  Fast forwarding through these bits of self-indulgent rubbish takes five to ten seconds so you can imagine how long it takes to view them.  Furthermore, the director attempts to create a family dynamic that is both adrift and riven by tension but utterly fails simply because there is no real point to it; it is misery for misery's sake.  Which, by the way is just like the movie on the whole.  The reason being that while the story does start out with some promise, it never develops into anything.  The 'star' creates a ponzi scheme to bilk his friends AND gets caught at it by a mystery man with ties to the underworld and even gets involved with the fellow, THEN has his ponzi scheme called by his friends, THEN gets found out by his family and yet NOTHING HAPPENS.  Not a thing happens and this is the problem with this really, truly, genuinely poor movie. To put it nicely it's like getting kissed but not conjugated.",1205625600,2,1859,4.505952380952381
