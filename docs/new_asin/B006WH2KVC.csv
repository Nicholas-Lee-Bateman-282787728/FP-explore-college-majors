The artwork even has the audacity to have the ""DVD"" logo on it, but it is the purple back disc we have grown to dislike since they seem to not hold up as well as the silver back DVDs. Also, this movie is known as ""Inside Amy"" which is a decidedly less lurid title so I'm sure that has a great deal to do with the name change. I'm not going to go into the details of the movie itself, but I have gotten a bit annoyed with the majority of the DVD reviews here on Amazon as time and again people fail to mention the specs of the DVD itself, which I can't be the only one who finds that info important. This is a full screen transfer as indicated in the product notes. It's maybe slightly better than VHS quality and a bit better than most PD titles. If you are looking for a fun, even paced slasher flick, look elsewhere. You don't see much of the few kills that are presented, but the aftermath of the kills can be a bit gruesome at times, but nothing that wouldn't be trumped ten fold a few years later by Tom Savini. Any ways, the title was misleading so I felt the need to clarify that AND the fact it's a DVD-R. You are now armed with more knowledge than I had when I purchased this.",1331683200,22,1291,4.046875

Well, thanks to Apprehensive films  it is now available.  It was made in 1975  and it is a pretty good little flick!  Charlie hears about all these women at a ""swingers party"" and tells his wife Amy they should try it. Big mistake for Charlie as it does not work out so well for him.  However his ""hot wife"" Amy seems like a natural once she goes to bed with another man. Charlie is frustrated and now wants no part of the ""swingers"" scene but Amy is now into this and wants to go party!!  Its not much of a massacre but I don't want to give away the ending. However, this movie has a good plot and is worth a watch.  There is no gore in this film but there is a little nudity. ""Hats off"" to Apprehensive films for releasing alot of these old rare films that the major studios would take a pass on!",1330300800,7,954,4.0588235294117645
