8625322,5,B00GO55QIQ,"""Hanging Shadows"" is a wealth of knowledge, shedding light on the horror genre from Italian points-of-view. It gives insight to very specific projects like ""Demons"", ""Cannibal Holocaust"", and ""Once Upon A Time In America"". Plus the documentary gives us an understanding on the love- hate relationship the Italian film community held for the masters of horror and the whole ""fantasy"" film concept. It goes without saying that the Western, English speaking world had a higher respect and love for the films than Italian counterparts. Not my American pride, the issue is addressed in the documentary.

This is a film to get, I imagine watching it over and over. Mostly because the stories, collaborations and perspectives come from men whose films I have watched over and over. ""Hanging Shadows"" is a fascinating collection of information, Italian directors discussing how they met one another, experiences on set, and the publics reaction to the films at the time of their release. There isn't much more that I can really say other than this, ""Hanging Shadows"" is necessary for horror fans, if you want to understand the films and the people responsible for giving them to us, then why not let them tell you in their own words. Which is exactly what you get with this documentary. It is the best perspective on Italian horror on the market.",1432080000,,1338,4.973214285714286
8625323,5,B00GO55QIQ,"If you are a true horror fan like me, then you probably realize how much we owe Italian directors for the frights and gore that we have today.  Much of what the modern genre is for us is a result of what Italian filmmakers did decades ago.  But if you don't understand just how much influence these European masterpieces hold, then this documentary is definitely for you.  HANGING SHADOWS is an in-depth at some of horrors most influential Italian filmmakers, and it is a film that every single horror fan should own.

Ive been waiting for a documentary like this for a long time.  It is chocked full of interviews with some of the greatest horror filmmakers of our time.  No horror fan in his or her right mind can refute the influence of Bava or Fulci or Argento or Deodataso it is a real treat to see them onscreen.

HANGING SHADOWS is pretty simplistic with its presentation; the majority of the film is made up of the interviews.  There are a few cutaways to film clips, but these are minimal.  This is not a negative by any meansbut I feel I must mention it so you know what you're getting when you buy this DVD.

I particularly like hearing the mindset of each director as they discuss some of their most influential works.  For example, a couple of them don't like gorebut have them in their movies anyway.  I am not going to divulge names here because you need to watch the documentary!

HANGING SHADOWS is a big win for me, and any fan of horror cinema needs to own a copy.  Whether you are well-versed with Italian cinema or not, chances are you will be after this film is over.  It is available now, so give it a look.",1405382400,4,1630,4.368770764119601
