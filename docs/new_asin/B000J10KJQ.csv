2665832,4,B000J10KJQ,excellent workout for men.  I am in real good shape but this workout really pushed me and that is good.  the thick accent Australian accent is bit difficult to understand at times.,1169683200,4,180,4.59375
2665833,3,B000J10KJQ,"The exercises were correctly executed, the music was fine.  The pace was fine, I liked the different levels, the exercises seemed appropriate for each level.  Some of the stretches were really good.

The Instructor is from Australia.  The accent is a bit hard to take. The description of the pelvic floor for men was pretty funny ""As if you are stopping yoursef from breaking wind"".  Also she showed a bit of moon-cleavage, which my teenage son kind of enjoyed!

I might recommend it to a male client.",1169596800,7,501,4.7011494252873565
2665834,4,B000J10KJQ,"I bought this for my husband.  He believes it helps his back and flexibility, which have been problems for years.  His only complaint is that it is very long (about an hour) and sometimes he has to create his own stop and start points when he wants a shorter routine.",1169078400,20,267,4.32
2665835,5,B000J10KJQ,"As a sports lover who has suffered many injuries, and is looking for alternatives which can stimulate and strengthen without causing further damage, I have found this DVD [a gift from my wife] the exact thing I was looking for, and the exercises within it surprisingly challenging.  The relaxation section is also excellent.  The explanations are very clear to follow, and if you are like me and don't like to exercise with music in the background - it may be switched off and replaced with your own choice of music... excellent!",1167782400,19,529,4.802197802197802
2665836,5,B000J10KJQ,"I thought this routine would be easy- well it's tough-thats good though.  I still can't make it through the some of the routines, it will take time.  Lifting heavy weights gives no advantage with this exercise-helps me with endurance sports.  The routine is about 45 minutes long with 15 minutes of hardcore bonus exercises-can't do those yet.  The instructions are easy to understand- the video production is fine.",1364083200,,415,5.0588235294117645
2665837,1,B000J10KJQ,this dvd was too easy and boring for me. wasn't any different than any other pilates dvd i've watched. Not geared for men. just labeled that way.,1297123200,3,145,4.407407407407407
2665838,1,B000J10KJQ,"I bought this DVD in an attempt to introduce my boyfriend to Pilates. I thought it would be perfect to have a video made for men, so he didn't have to endure the typical ""girly-ness"" of most Pilates DVDs. Unfortunately, this DVD had the right idea in mind, but failed to accomplish it.

The instructor is one of the most boring & downtrodden that I have ever seen in a fitness DVD. Not only does she never smile, she speaks in mono-tone & behaves as though she is even as bored as you are!

The workout is very slow-paced & we didn't find it at all challenging. If anything, I would have thought it would be a bit more intense, as it is supposedly designed for men - NOPE! Also, the video quality was poor - slightly fuzzy & a lot of times, was filmed at a distance where you couldn't even see the move completely for guidance.

Looking for Pilates for men? Look elsewhere!!",1273363200,8,874,4.284848484848485
2665839,4,B000J10KJQ,"I haven't actually bought this DVD yet, nor have I used it. This review is based on a single viewing of a borrowed DVD.

This looks to me like it will augment nicely my fitness regimen. I've been looking for something a bit less intense to work into the mix, and this looks like a really good alternative. I'll probably be buying it and will end up using it during a certain portion of the fitness year. In case you're wondering, my fitness year revolves around the bicycling season, which is my main fitness passion. I have recently worked in some strength-training as well, which I do pretty much year-round, twice a week. So I'm looking to Pilates as an alternative at some points in the year to my current strength-training routines.

I found the exercises in this video to be explained and demonstrated well. The instructor can be a little hard to understand (for us Americans) at times owing to her British accent. I actually got a bit turned off about Pilates after reviewing the book ""Pilates for Men,"" but viewing this DVD has got me interested again in incorporating it into my routine.

The pros of the DVD are listed above. About the only con I might mention is the length of the workout. The workout demonstrated on the DVD is almost exactly 1 hour in length, which is pretty long. Add to that the warm-up, which is 11 minutes in length, and you have a really lengthy workout. So, if you don't have about 1.25 hours to devote to a workout, this one won't be for you.

I should also mention that there's a separate 15 minute segment called the ""bonus power section"" on the DVD. The routines demonstrated in this segment appear to be a bit more intense than those shown in the regualr, hour-long workout. They don't really explain on the DVD how this segment is to be used. Perhaps if someone is pressed for time and/or just wants a shorter, slightly more intense, workout, one could combine this with the 11 minute warm-up for a workout that would last a little less than .5 hour.

I see that this DVD has gotten some negative reviews. Here's a suggestion for potential buyers that may save you from ending up with a product that doesn't suit your needs. This DVD is available in many public libraries in the U.S. Do yourself a favor and check out the DVD from your local library--or order it through your library's inter-library loan dept., like I did--and review it before buying.",1260230400,3,2394,4.545243619489559
2665840,5,B000J10KJQ,"Got this DVD and book with same title (different authors): watching basic lesson now. Besides being very well produced, the instructor provides a -lot- of detailed info as the workout progresses (two guys - 1 novice, 1 advanced). Have taken Pilates classes in past at my fitness club but as the only guy in a class of 30 and being a beginner, I didn't feel particularly comfortable.

Can't yet speak to whether Pilates itself will do what I want (fewer back issues, lose some weight) but the core routines look very good, especially as complementary workout to weightlifting, cardio.",1259280000,,583,4.888888888888889
2665841,4,B000J10KJQ,"I know there is a stigma with pilates workouts being geared towards women.  Most likely because the focus is on building your core strength, which revolves on your pelvic area.  Well I'm here to tell you to get over the stigma.  This is a great workout for men that can't do heavy impact training and men that cannot do intense cardio.

I have had bulging discs in my lower back for years.  I cannot find too many suitable cardio options, such as running, because the impact wrecks havoc on my lower back.  Due to the economy I cannot keep up with my gym membership, so I have no choice but to find an alternative at home.

Pilates for Men is well explained and easy to follow.  They have a low intensity workout and a more intense workout for you to follow.  The moves are easy to follow, but you may want to watch the DVD once to get an idea for them.  You going to notice right away that although the moves are slow and intense, they can be tricky at times, but in the end you will see and feel results.  There are a couple of moves that were a little straining on my neck, but I just modified them a little bit.  The workout is prefaced with a great stretching warm up as well as a cool down.  The main workout is around 40 minutes.  Not exactly something for those on the go, but also included is a shorter, more intense workout meant for those days you don't have a lot of time.

Besides building core strength, I found this workout helped with my flexability, and even cleared up a nerve issue I was having in my leg.  I've also noticed an improvement in my posture, due to a stronger core and proper pelvic positioning.  As to the claims of improving sexual performance....let's just say your not going to go from dud to stud, but since your building strength and flexibility, you may be able to move into different positions or stay in a position longer.",1257033600,7,1863,4.307471264367816
2665842,4,B000J10KJQ,"For the most part, a good workout, but I wish the main workout was divided into separate scenes to give you some flexibility in customizing your workout.

2665843,2,B000J10KJQ,"I was excited to get a Pilates for men workout, but when I ordered this I hadn't realized it was by a woman. I guess what I mean is I expected a tougher, drill sargent. I know that's not really what Pilates is but it made me feel like I was doing a womanly workout.  I guess I wanted something a little more fast piced, this bored me to death. I couldn't get through the entire thing the first time because Lindsey's voice annoyed the hell out of me. I am extremely disappointed with this, the only redeeming quality about this dvd is the 15 minute workout at the end. What a waste 0f $22.",1214784000,13,589,4.121739130434783
2665844,5,B000J10KJQ,"This video is stellar!  With her impressively proficient, professional expertise, she walks you through a program that not only enhances other physical activities, but seems to be ideal, even as a replacement for the weight training I've done for years!  Truthfully, being from the old school, I never thought of embracing these types of training and fitness techniques (I used to assume they were more for women), but this is an overall, well balanced workout for all guys!  It's fun, much more convenient, and comprehensively all-encompassing! Makes you feel great all over!  Wow!!",1193702400,5,583,5.236559139784946
2665845,5,B000J10KJQ,"I am a soldier in the US Army. I have found this DVD to be a useful tool to stay in shape when pinched for time and work space. It's easy to fallow, requires minimal space, and requires minimal time. I find it easier to sholder my gear, My back pains are reduced, and I feel less tired when on mission for long periods. I do the exercises on the army issued mat and an able to exercise in a small area. It pumps me up for mission, keeps me in shape, and dosn't overwork your muscles to the point of muscle failure (which is very important if you go on mission in a pinch right after.) I would refer this product to any soldier that does not have time to hit the gym.",1173312000,38,666,3.9776119402985075

Do feel that my core is getting stronger. Look forward to seeing a performance change after 30 workouts. After 30 workouts will incorporate this once per week into overall fitness program.

I was watching more than exercising at first. Now I'm working on the technique and building strength.  The rest will come will come with time.",1387065600,,499,4.450549450549451
