There is a theft of a diamond. Two older women visit, Watson receives the Garrideb sisters. They rent rooms and have a case for Sherlock Holmes. The Prime Minister wants Holmes to recover the Mazarin diamond. But Sherlock is away in the Highlands so Mycroft fills in. The Garrideb sisters tell of a financial offer from an American, who is searching for others named Garrideb. Mycroft visits Count Sylvius, the last visitor to that museum. Mr. Garrideb visits Watson to warn him about interference.

Mycroft visits a diamond jeweler and learns about an offer. Count Sylvius is a friend of the Prince and Princess of Wales. Watson reads an advertisement, the Garridebs are suspicious. Mycroft keeps records on Count Sylvius and questions him. Sherlock sends a note to Mycroft. Watson learns more about Nathan Garridebs room. Mycroft arrives to stay with Watson. John Garrideb arrives to search the cellar. Winters talks after Mycroft questions him. Mycroft goes to the place where the boat is and finds Count Sylvius. He recovers the diamond, the police capture Count Sylvius.

This combination of two stories is the worst in this series. Brett was sickened by his medication and could not appear, so Mycroft took his place. One of the clues is the differences between English and American. Noah Webster tried to simplify spelling, hence jail for gaol, plow for plough, etc. Brett was diagnosed as bi-polar, this may explain his acting in some of the stories.",1478736000,,1482,4.991902834008097

This movie is based on the story ""The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone"" (1921) written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859 to 1930).  This Doyle story is actually an adaptation of his play ""The Crown Diamond,"" first performed in 1921.

What's unfortunate about this episode is that the incomparable Jeremy Brett who plays Sherlock Holmes is only in about 30 seconds of it (20 seconds at the beginning and 10 seconds at the end to shout out the line that titles this review).  He was unable to act in it due to his illness.  Another thing that's unfortunate is this story is not entirely faithful to Conan Doyle's story since it combines another Doyle story (""The Adventure of the Three Garridebs,"" 1924) with this story.

Thus, what we have is the presentation of two unrelated Doyle stories with one being investigated by Dr. Watson (Edward Hardwicke) and another being investigated by Sherlock's brother, Mycroft (Charles Gray).  A connection is found between the two cases.

In this episode, ""The Three Garridebs"" is the lesser story to ""The Mazarin Stone.""  This is why this episode has the title it has.

Therefore, this episode will appeal to two different types of viewers.

The first is those viewers unfamiliar with this series.  They will find that the story presented is quite good with plenty of action and with the fine acting of Charles Gray.  They might rate this episode 4 stars.

Those viewers familiar with the series (like me) will probably have a different reaction.  As mentioned, no Jeremy Brett and not a faithful adaptation to Conan Doyle's original 1921 story.  For me, this episode turned into a standard crime drama and felt contrived.  They might rate this episode 2 stars.

My final rating is an average of these two separate ratings.

Finally, as with all the episodes in this series, the costumes, background music, attention to detail, and cinematography are quite well done.

In conclusion, I have to give credit to the writers for their creativity for making the best of a bad situation and coming up with a decent story!

7859729,3,6304025882,"The shortcoming of ""The Mazarin Stone"" noted by other reviews is real.  Jeremy Brett is the strength of this Holmes series, and this episode was made when his illness prevented much participation.  The few scenes he does have are well-acted, but saddening.  But the episode has a treat for those who appreciate the BBC version of Richard II. One of the highlights of that production is the dilemma of the vacillating, easygoing Duke of York (Charles Gray) as he's torn between his nephews, Richard II (Derek Jacobi) and the usurper Bolingbroke (Jon Finch), with Bolingbroke riding rough-shod over both.  In this Holmes episode Gray (as Mycroft Holmes) and Finch meet again with reversed results.  The sparring of these two deft actors is so enjoyable that I've ended up watching this episode more than the others from the last Holmes season.  The camera work, always superb, is at its best in this epsiode - especially in the beautifully transferred dvd version.  What a shame the dvds for this series aren't packaged individually!",1121299200,,1031,4.994152046783626
7859730,3,6304025882,"The Granada series is full of top-quality productions, clearly done by people who loved Conan Doyle's stories and were willing to go the extra mile to make Victorian/Edwardian England come alive.  As for the title character...as far as I'm concerned, that keen-eyed, black-clad man on the screen isn't Jeremy Brett at all, it's Sherlock Holmes incarnate.  His Holmes is by turns brilliant, arrogant, mischievous, sneering, moody, insufferable, and kindhearted, and Brett earns high marks for making him both larger than life and touchingly - at times almost heartbreakingly - human.
If you're new to the series, however, ""Mazarin Stone"" is a terrible place to start.  As other reviewers have noted, Brett's poor health kept him off-camera for about 95% of the film, and he leaves an unfillable hole. Edward Hardwicke (Dr. Watson) and Charles Gray (Holmes' brother Mycroft) are fine actors who do far more than just make Brett look good, but they can't carry an entire episode by themselves.
And yet...the Granada team deserves credit for their creative efforts to circumvent two major problems with this episode.  The first was their source material; ""Mazarin Stone"" is widely regarded as the worst Sherlock Holmes story in the Canon.  By filling in the plot with elements from another adventure (""The Three Garridebs""), they created a solid hybrid, making eminently watchable television out of a barely readable story.
The second problem, sadly, was Brett himself.  Age and illness dimmed neither his acting ability nor his deft touch for the subtleties of Holmes' character, but after a certain point, they did keep him from looking the part.  Holmes led a rough, unhealthy life, and he's not supposed to be good-looking, but he *is* supposed to be thin to the point of emaciation and relatively young - in his 30s and 40s at most.  Brett was a slim and youthful 50 when he started in the role (if anything, he was too handsome for it back then), but as time passed, he aged and put on weight.  I saw some of the later episodes on PBS in the early `90s and was underwhelmed; brilliant actor or no, he simply didn't look like the gaunt, high-strung sleuth I'd envisioned.
Keeping Brett off-camera, therefore, had its merits, and the manner in which it was done made the best of a bad situation. From his mysterious departure at the beginning of ""Mazarin"" to his dreamlike and dishevelled reappearance at its conclusion, the absent Holmes broods over the story like an enigmatic spectre.  It's an interesting psychological effect, and one almost wishes Granada had taken the bold step of making the episode entirely posthumous - using it to show Holmes' continuing influence over the two men who knew him best and turning his quiet ""Brother mine...bravo!"" at the end into an eerie benediction.  Overall, ""The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone"" is compelling not so much what it shows, but for what it doesn't.",1063756800,2,2906,4.971134020618557
7859731,3,6304025882,"A Holmes episode without Sherlock? Unthinkable, it would seem, but somehow this reworking of two Conan Doyle stories (The Three Garridebs and The Mazarin Stone) comes together reasonably well, thanks largely to the charisma of Charles Gray, and a trio of amusing supporting players in the roles of the three Garrideb siblings. Edward Hardwicke is also on hand to lend solid support as Watson, and provides this episode with much-needed continuity in the absence of the incomparable Jeremy Brett. The latter does appear briefly at the beginning and the end, and his presence curiously permeates the entire episode. Brett's scenes were filmed at a later stage when he was in better health, and the previous reviewer is quite incorrect in stating that this was his final outing as Holmes. The series actually concluded with The Cardboard Box, filmed a month after The Mazarin Stone, and featuring a memorable performance from Jeremy Brett.",1038009600,,936,5.1644736842105265
7859732,1,6304025882,"From the short story generally agreed to be Arthur Conan Doyle's worst -- ta-da! -- it's the worst (and last) of the Jeremy Brett series. In fact,  you should be warned that Brett, clearly a dying man, only appears at the  end of this episode to cry out ""Bravo, Brother!"" or some such  nonsense, after an hour of lame deductions and absurd melodramatics from  Charles Grey as Mycroft and Edward Hardwicke as Watson... A travesty and a  sad note to end a fine series on.",965952000,4,469,4.470588235294118
