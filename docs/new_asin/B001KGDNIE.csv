8314974,4,B001KGDNIE,Expected more. I guess I was a little disappointed by the fact that it only covers 4 songs. I need more Dave!,1502064000,,109,4.0
8314975,4,B001KGDNIE,"Not perfect but still valuable. This doesn't include tab and the host that sits with Dave occasionally leaves out questions about the exact fretting Dave is doing. That said, you can figure out most of it by watching the close ups of Mason's hands. I received the most value of just watching the close up of the solos and learning his technique.",1491350400,,345,4.580645161290323

8314977,2,B001KGDNIE,"This dvd was very misleading & lacking in everything it advertised ! Had only some intro licks to his tunes, no solos in tab, no full songs , etc. Just a very little bit of miscellaneous noodling. Check out Leslie West, The Story DVD for an example of what this kind of artist instructional should be. This is no reflection on Dave Mason. He's one of my favorite musicians. The content of the dvd was pathetic. The empty, incomplete tab booklet was a dead giveaway of the dismally underwhelming content. A great injustice to a creative guitarist song writer like Dave Mason.",1377734400,,574,4.637254901960785
8314978,5,B001KGDNIE,"I've always wanted to play the songs from Alone Together and this disc is great instruction. Most of the parts are not that difficult to play.  The trick is in the tunings, which they explain and help you tune to exactly.  I only wish he would do another one to finish out the songs from Alone Together.  I am amending my old review because the only DVD player that won't handle this disc is the one in my computer.  I had played other DVD's in the past, and this one had the misfortune to be the first that wouldn't work.  Now it won't play any DVD's.  Sorry for the misunderstanding.",1377388800,,585,4.2727272727272725
8314979,5,B001KGDNIE,"This dvd is wonderful. It is of Dave being prodded to give up his licks and methods. When he continually replies, ""I don't know what I did, I just do it"", and then asks his assistant to tell him what it was that he did, it is just fabulous. The songs he goes over are from his solo career. A little disappointing that he doesn't show some of his ""Traffic"" magic. Maybe for legal reasons, maybe he doesn't want to haggle with Winwood and Capaldi. When he confides that he got this from Stills, and this from Lennon, you are getting an inside look at one of the true survivors.",1259625600,4,575,4.236363636363636
8314980,4,B001KGDNIE,"All those fans that are lucky enough to know about the talents of Dave Mason, don't need to read this review. If you have ever been fortunate enough to see Dave in concert, you know what I'm talking about. Not only does this dvd include some great secrets for guitarist, there's also some really good concert footage included here.",1239926400,,331,4.627118644067797
8314981,5,B001KGDNIE,"Dave Mason was one of the best musicians and songwriters produced by the sixties era of music. In addition to his great songwriting and vocals with traffic I was always impressed by his very straightforward guitar style. For the first time this DVD gives real insight into his seemingly effortless guitar style. Prompted by a young musician who is knowledgeable about Daves music, Dave reveals open tunings he learned from Stephen Stills, rhythm phrases and lead parts to each of the four tunes in this lesson. Dave is forthright and forthcoming, the interviewer asks just the right questions, and there are lots of amusing anecdotes by Dave. This is a very good guitar lesson if you are interested in this era of music and desire insight into how some of its best songs were put together.",1237334400,4,789,4.8088235294117645
8314982,5,B001KGDNIE,"What a treat -- sixty minutes of lessons from one of the greatest guitarists of all time. This DVD covers all of the essential licks for playing Only You Know and I Know; Look at You, Look at Me; You Shouldn't Have Took More Than You Gave; and We Just Disagree. Since guitar instruction doesn't seem to come natural to Mason, an emcee accompanies him, coaxing Dave for those nuggets of detail about each song. It's an arrangement that works well. Mason politely complies with every request to ""play that lick again"" or ""play it slowly."" In addition, the DVD includes clips of Mason and his band playing live in concert. If you're a guitar player and, in particular, a Dave Mason fan, you'll want to own this DVD.",1236038400,6,712,4.5271317829457365
8314983,1,B001KGDNIE,"If you are looking for an hour long guitar lesson from Dave Mason, this is it.  Unfortunately, I wasn't.  The Amazon online description does not say anything about it being a guitar lesson and so I was expecting it to be a DVD of Dave Mason's music.  Wrong.  A big surprise and most people do not like complete surprises in the products they are purchasing.",1229472000,2,357,4.446153846153846
