8268498,3,B00186DF2A,"Although Alexi may play very good, the DVD lacks depth into his style, notes, reasons of composition and what he is doing.... if you just wanna copy and really know nothing else.... this is it....each song is just a sampling 2 - 3 tabs most on a smallest scale of his songs......I'm glad he paid a bunch for making this DVD....he seems a bit nervous most of the time in his demonstrations of techniques etc..... this DVD is just a hook to get you to sign up online for their onile guitar bass, drums, vocal programs.  Other than that its kinda nice to see his guitars and how he dresses usually.",1369267200,,595,4.36036036036036
8268499,2,B00186DF2A,"Alexi is a great guitar player but he wouldn't have a clue how to teach you to replicate any of what he does. He shows you the notes he plays, then plays them himself at full speed ... nothing you couldn't get from a Guitar Pro file! Plus he seems grumpy as all heck in this video, so it isn't even pleasant to watch him talking about what he's doing. Wouldn't buy it again if I had the chance.",1330473600,,394,4.0
8268500,4,B00186DF2A,"I must say, very good. Alexi shows some awesome solos and riffs, and there is a booklet with full transcriptions of what he plays. You can also download backing tracks at the rockhouse website, which makes it even better. So this is what I like about the DVD.

Here are the downpoints: nothing from first three albums!!!! (which are the best ones!)
Numerous typing errors in the booklet, such as writing 15 instead of 17 in the are you dead yet riff.
The first page of the are you dead yet solo is...missing. He who wrote the booklet ""accidentally"" pasted the in your face solo where the are you dead yet one should have been! The idiot! However, Alexi plays the solo at a slow speed first, so its pretty easy to pick out what he's doing just by looking at him.

Buy it!",1214956800,4,770,4.340277777777778
