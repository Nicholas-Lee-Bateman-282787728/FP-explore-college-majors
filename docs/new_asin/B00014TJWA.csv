8006451,5,B00014TJWA,I love this CD so much! This is my second copy. I teache 18 months to 2 years old Sunday School and 2 & 3 year old children's church. I have used this CD for going on 10 years. Now I  needed a new copy because we have worn it.,1453593600,,226,3.52
8006452,5,B00014TJWA,"i liked it because it doesn't have all the modern, snazzy stuff in it,  of today , I think it has a 2003 copyright,  although it was done by a psychologist,{ and Christianity and psych., don't mix}  I think it conveys what we would want to present to our grandaughter in a simple honest way  Clyde",1356912000,,297,4.25

8006454,5,B00014TJWA,"We received this video as a hand me down from family.  This is the ONLY video my child, who is 15 mos, will watch through. I purchased the entire collection of Praise Baby dvd's and he likes them but not near as much as he likes this one.  Often times when he is fussy or fighting sleep this dvd soothes him where he will calm down and eventually go to sleep.  My son is NOT entertained AT ALL by baby einstein, he is totally NOT interested in those videos and to me those are painful to watch.  I LOVE THIS VIDEO!!!  This video is slow paced songs, most of them solid old church hyms and my son loves them! I would recommend this video to anyone and am shocked to hear of negative reviews!  high praise from our household!!",1184457600,2,724,4.172661870503597
8006455,5,B00014TJWA,"I was shocked to read the other reviews for this series of dvds. I borrowed this one from our library and I can't wait to purchase it. I have three children, ages 6, 3, and 2 and all three enjoyed it very much. It is a combination of Baby Einstien and Cedarmont Kids. The songs are the perfect mix of hymns, choruses, and preschool songs and are well sung. The dvd mixes animation, live action children, and shots of toys and puppets for a nice diversity. Several times between songs there is a prayer said or a interjection about God. I found it very peaceful to watch and felt it really drew my kids into God's presence. I prefered it over the Praise Baby dvd collection. A real blessing to watch!!",1104624000,,700,4.351145038167939
8006456,1,B00014TJWA,"I'm very glad I did not spend my money on this DVD.  I had heard of it, then checked it out from the library.  This movie was not well made.  It absolutely could not hold the attention of my 1 year old.  He loves his Baby Einstein movie & I hoped this DVD would be on par with that, but it is not.  They do not seem to have a grasp on what kind of images will hold the attention of babies.  There is one song where the whole song just shows a little girl kneeling next to a teddy bear, and she just picks and pulls at the bear the whole time.  Unbelievable.  The whole thing was painful for me to watch, and my 1 yr. old found better things to do.  An older child might sit still for this (my 6 year old did watch it through, but she did not ask to see it again after that).  It's a great concept, but they need to go back to the drawing board.",1102204800,,844,3.7988505747126435
