8522295,4,B007VTEE8M,"This instructor is really good and seems to know his material inside out.  Presindation is a little disorganized, but would highly recommend this tape.  It seems to have techniques that would be valuable to anyone regardless of age.",1495324800,,232,5.078947368421052

8522299,4,B007VTEE8M,"Sifu Clear is very good in projecting the basic skills and moves to help the student understand how the moves of Xing-Yi can be used in actual self defense. What I like is that the different fists of the Xing-Yi moves connect with one another. If you have some experience in a combat system, you can see how practical the hand and arm moves and position help in defending against an incoming strike, allowing to move the body using body shifting and positioning to get to a vulnerable area to strike. If you analyse this you learn to strike with many parts of your body. I recommend this DVD.",1388793600,7,592,4.440366972477064
8522300,5,B007VTEE8M,"I have studied martial arts for quite a long time.  In my later years, I have taken up Tai Chi Chuan because of some age and profession related physical limitations.  I discovered Sigung Clear's work while searching for applications of Tai Chi to self defense.  I have been a fan and a student ever since, even visiting his school in Tennessee.  He has an excellent presentation and a far-reaching set of experiences and skills in a number of the martial arts, developed over thirty years of active study and instruction.  If you wish to study the self-defense side of Tai Chi, and you really want to learn at home, Clear is your guy.  I highly recommend any of his DVD courses.  They deliver what they advertise.",1358467200,9,713,4.611111111111111
