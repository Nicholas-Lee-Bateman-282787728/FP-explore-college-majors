3085585,5,B0012909QS,This workout is not for beginners! This is ADVANCED. One thing most advanced exercisers appreciate is the combos not being broken down too much. After you get them down you can just cruise through the workout without slowing down from then on. Amy is great with creating choreography that is FUN and intense. And I'm not usually one to enjoy much choreography. This is one of my all time favorite kickboxing videos. It may take you once or twice to get it down totally but that won't keep you from getting a great workout til then. Just keep trying its worth it! The music is great and energizing as well. Amy has a fun personality.,1215129600,,632,4.504347826086956
3085586,1,B0012909QS,"My dvd is practically brand new. I only used it once and will never again. I was able to follow along the warm up just fine, but anything past that, forget it! There is absolutely NO cueing, she rapidly changes moves with no warning and throws out terms that i have never heard before. It was impossible to follow along. Absolutely a waste of money!",1214179200,9,349,4.384615384615385
3085617,5,B0012909QS,"I am SO glad that I did not let the reviews on here *SCARE ME* from ordering this DVD! As others have written, if you are experienced in kickboxing, this workout will not only challenge you, but provide you with an excellent calorie burn, along with great results to your physique. The moves are complex (not all), approximately 50% are complex. After completing this video for the 3rd time (just this morning) I was able to keep up with 90% of the workout AND I burned almost 600 calories in 81 minutes (total length of workout). This is a great workout to do on a weekend or day when you are off work. I do this on Saturday or Sunday, first thing in the morning, so I can devote my time to completing the entire workout and focusing on the exercises, without having to rush through it. If you have some ""rhythm"" lol, and enjoy a challenging workout, that is effective in buring calories, then don't listen to negative reviews - GO FOR IT!! :-)If you don't ""pick it up"" the first time, keep doing it, you will pick up the moves, the more you do the workout!",1356739200,,1058,4.348484848484849
3085618,5,B0012909QS,"If you are experienced with kickboxing, do not let the reviews on here scare you. The choreography is complex but by no means inaccessible.  I watched the DVD once, and after a couple of times through at a slow pace I had it down.  This DVD is very appropriate for advanced users because Amy doesn't waste time slowly talking through and breaking down the moves, which annoys me with a lot of other DVDs.  Besides, who wants to waste money on a DVD you can do perfectly the first time through?  I have trouble finding a video that gives me an adequate challenge, but Amy's videos always give me something to strive for.
The DVD has five combos and five surges.  The full routine has combo 1, surge 1, combo 2, surge 2, then 1 and 2 together, followed by combo 3, surge 3, combo 4, surge 4, 3 and 4 together, and finally combo 5, surge 5, then a full run of sequence 5 (combo and surge together).  Then there several ""mixes,"" which recombine the combos and surges into shorter workouts.  I prefer to start off with the full routine and skip around rather than select one of the premixes.  The way the DVD is recorded this is very easy to do, and more often than not I realize that I'm having so much fun I want to do the whole thing anyway.
The combos are punch/kick drills that have a lot of variety (front, back, and side kicks, jabs, crosses, hooks, elbows, jawbreakers, speedbags, jump kicks, knees, ducks, etc).  The surges are mostly varieties of jump kicks but include punching as well.
There are a few things about this workout that make me love it more than others I have.  For one thing I like that there is a lot of footwork.  In a lot of kickboxing DVDs I feel like I'm standing in one spot doing the moves, but Amy has you shuffling around and really using the floorspace.  Even if you don't have a lot of room you can shuffle in place and get an awesome bonus to your workout.  The other aspect of this DVD I love is that it is extremely adaptable.  It seems like whether I am in the mood for something really challenging or need to take a light day I can follow this workout.  It's easy to take it up a notch and throw in a lot of jumps and put some bounce in your shuffle if you want intensity.  But when I had a foot injury this DVD saved my sanity because I was able to do it and have a lot of fun just by staying grounded and cutting out the jumps.
All in all, if you like kickboxing you want this DVD.  The moves aren't like anything you'll find in other DVDs, it's a lot of fun, and despite what you'll read on here it's pretty easy to follow.  Give it a chance and you won't be disappointed!",1335744000,5,2612,4.19
3085619,3,B0012909QS,"This was the first DVD from Amy Bentos I have ever ordered and I must say I was very disappointed.  I ordered it because I generally love kick boxing moves AND it was a long workout however I was so frustrated because I couldn't keep up with her.  By the time I finally did get the hang of a sequence, she was on to another and so I don't feel I got the heart pumping I was use to with The FIRM DVD's I have or Jillian.",1327881600,2,419,3.8045977011494254
3085620,4,B0012909QS,"I was warned by previous reviews of this product that ""Xtreme"" was demonstrated not only in the intensity of this workout, but also in complexity. My review is no different. Yes, Bento ramps up the cardio training with high-energy combos and intervals. This is definitely an endurance challenge. HOWEVER, at the same time, Bento's combinations have no sense of progression. Instead, they basically go from complex to even more complex. It can be a little frustrating at first, especially for beginners. But, I am sure that doing this workout repeatedly will make things easier. Even advanced kickboxing lovers (e.g. those who have done workouts like Billy Blanks many times) will have trouble. Regardless of her fast pace, I recommend this video because of Bento's intense, non-stop cardio drills. Just, be patient with yourself!",1320969600,,829,5.2406015037593985
3085621,5,B0012909QS,"This is a high impact, high intensity long workout filled with fun, high energy choreography.  Lots of jump kicks and jumping in general. You definitely feel like you've given your all when you're done. I was at a full tilt sweat after the warm up. :) I like that she does not slow down to teach the steps so that once you learn them, you don't have to slow down every time you use the dvd.  She does break up the steps into groups, though, which helps. It also helps to have experience following choreography. I also like that the workout is seamless- you don't have to stop and select another segment to get a long enough workout like with many other workout videos.  It does have the additional boxing segment, though, for people who have boxing equipment, and a stretching segment.

 Unfortunately, I had stabbing pains in my feet, ankles, and hips after a couple of days, but I did already have lots of joint problems to begin with. She does have a pregnant lady who does the workout with a few modifications.  This is no ordinary pregnant lady, though- she's majorly tough! It's very motivating because you think in your mind, ""I should be able to do that!"" Do NOT do this workout, even with the modifications, if you are pregnant or injury prone.  Stick with Walking with Leslie Sansone if that is the case. All in all, it's a great workout for someone looking for a real challenge and the music's good, too.",1303862400,,1415,4.50390625
3085622,5,B0012909QS,"I have been doing this workout three days a week for three weeks now, and I no longer make any mistakes.  It takes time to learn the routines, yes, but that's because it is a nonstop cardio workout that unlike so many other workouts of its kind does not get boring.  It has to be complex to prevent boredom for me, and this DVD delivers.  Yes, at first it was complex and a bit hard to follow, but I was expecting much worse after reading the reviews here.  If you focus, do it several times a week and are an experienced exerciser, you will have it down in no time.

This DVD is NOT FOR BEGINNERS.  If you don't know basic kickboxing and need instruction on proper form for punches and kicks, go buy something simpler, because Amy does not explain them, and that is just fine by me.  There is nothing more annoying to the intermediate to advanced exerciser that having to go through slow, boring repetitions of learning basic moves.  That is not what I wanted, and this DVD won't do it.  You will not slow your heart rate while the instructor explains things for beginners, which is why this workout is so effective.

I was also surprised that people said this DVD had bad cuing on the part of Amy Bento - I think the cues are perfect considering the speed at which the workout is moving.  Amy does a great job at keeping things moving while giving good instruction and cues.

You will sweat and burn calories like crazy with this video, and if you take the time to do it repeatedly, you will catch on to the moves quickly.  Great workout and it will stay in my regular rotation for a long time.",1301097600,,1596,4.315436241610739
3085623,1,B0012909QS,"Its not that this is a bad workout; it just wasn't for me. This is an aerobic choreographed workout with some kicks and punches, not a kickboxing workout. I don't to do grapevines and bouncy steps. That's so 80's. I was looking to kickbox. Right from the start the video irritated me. All the girls wear matching workout wear have smiles pasted on their faces and the heaviest girl of the bunch is the one who will be doing the ""modified"" version. It felt like high school. And I hate the barn doors in the background. I want to do a workout that a guy would come to, not a soccer mom routine that looks like it was filmed in a strip mall.",1295049600,6,639,4.203252032520325
3085624,4,B0012909QS,"I love this video!  Its complicated at first but I just watched the steps carefully and rewound a couple of times for the steps that were harder and i was fine.  I'm not a kickboxing expert and was able to catch on after the second time of doing the video.  She kick's your butt and I cant wait to try more of her videos - definitly gives you a great work out.

THe only thing i wish was different was that she incorporated weights into the workout instead of the bands.",1286409600,,470,4.131868131868132
3085625,5,B0012909QS,"This is my go-to workout whenever I'm feeling tired and in need of energy lift.  No matter how sore I am from a prior workout session, or how tired I am, this workout always leaves me pumped and smiling.

The workout consists of:
**5 kickbox sections, with each section followed by an intensity blast.
**a core section
**a relaxing stretch.

There's also a bonus heavy bag section and lots of premixes.  You will never get bored with this workout!

What I loved about this workout:

**the music keeps you smiling and moving.  I'm just as energized on the 5th section as I am when I start the workout.
**the wonderful stretch that includes a little tai chi, some gentle yoga stretches and some general stretches.  I tend to skip the last stretch when I'm short on time, but I always look forward to this stretch.
**Amy's teaching style.  She breaks down part of a move, goes on to the rest of the routine and then puts it all together.  You then do 2 sections together, so you can further practice the moves.
**the quasi-complex moves. I love routines that make me think and this workout does just that.  The moves are terribly complicated, but they're a bit more involved than hook, upper cut, punch, punch.

I highly recommend this workout to anyone wanting a fun kickboxing workout that gives you lots of options.",1283040000,3,1315,4.5965665236051505
3085626,5,B0012909QS,"I love love love this DVD, I've done several kickboxing dvd's ie. Taebo, and consider myself intermediate/advanced..but this is like no other. I love the kickboxing techniques, its a lot of moving (which I love). Its definetly not for beginners. I was sweating within the first 20min. The music is great and keeps you pumped up.

3085637,5,B0012909QS,"I would suggest this DVD to anyone that wants a super charged workout!  It's not easy and takes some coordination, but you will get it!  You want to loose weight and inches, they will melt away (or sweat away) with this DVD.  Amy Bento is hardcore, I LOVED IT!!!",1271980800,2,262,4.3061224489795915
3085638,4,B0012909QS,"the packaging the video was shipped in was horrible, but fortunately the dvd still played with no evidence of damage from the scratches it acquired.",1265760000,,148,4.96
3085639,4,B0012909QS,"Let me start off by saying this is an excellent workout. I believe if you did this 3-4 times a week  with some weight training on the side you will get yourself into amazing.  But just be warned this isn't a super easy workout. If you are easily frustrated or terribly uncoordinated then this might not be for you. I am dripping sweat at the end of this workout.  It really sculpts the arms, abs and shoulders.  You see results after about 8 workouts.

Be patient. Give yourself time to learn the routine. Don't expect to finish the entire dvd the first few times you do it. Amy Bento is one of my favorite instructors.",1263600000,,619,4.3478260869565215
3085640,4,B0012909QS,"so eh.. me and my roomate did attempt this workout. it was very hard!!! which you know it's working when your covered in sweat!!! she does have clueing issues, but just like in a real kickboxing class, you have to get familar with it and try again! will buy more of her dvd's.",1261526400,,276,4.226415094339623
3085641,4,B0012909QS,"This is a really challenging and difficult DVD. Which is what makes it fabulous! Yes, the moves are difficult to learn. I am uncoordinated, but love a workout that will challenge me. You must be patient and learn the routines, and you must do it in order! Do not do the pre-mixes until you go through the DVD in order a few times. You will be rewarded! If I can learn these routines, anyone can. And remember, even when you are making mistakes while learning, you are burning tons of fat!",1256860800,,488,4.373626373626373
3085642,5,B0012909QS,This is a great workout for those at an intermediate/advanced fitness level.  It helps to have already done some kickboxing classes in the past.  I love the high intensity intervals between each segment.  It has a great core workout at the end.  The nrg mixes are great also so you can mix up the workout order.  Amy's moves are creative and fun.  And of course she always has great motivating music.,1246838400,,400,4.563380281690141
3085643,5,B0012909QS,"I originally didn't like this workout, because it left me frustrated with its complexity (like other reviewers here). However, I love Amy Bento and own everything else she comes out with. I consider myself advanced and have tackled other complex workouts recently, so I dared to pull this one out again. I must say, I'm so glad I did. This time, I was able to follow along quite well with just a few modifications and was amazed with Amy's perfect, careful cueing. How could I miss this before? I think I wasn't listening. If you pay attention, you will be able to follow and get a fabulous, fun, sweat-filled workout, plus you'll feel accomplished being able to do it. I also added weighted gloves to increase the intensity. If you like Tap Less-Step More, Seasun Zieger workouts, and Amy's newer hi/lo and kickboxing DVDs, you will be able to do this. But if you don't enjoy complex choreography don't try it and then give it a bad review - not fair at all!!",1246838400,6,960,4.554913294797688
3085644,5,B0012909QS,I like to exercise at home. I am especially interested in kickboxing. I liked this DVD a lot. It's challenging and fun. One warning: it's not for beginners. I recommend it for people who have some experience in kickboxing. I loved it.,1246838400,,234,4.595238095238095
3085645,3,B0012909QS,"Amy Bento is hard-core.  All her workouts are probably not for beginners.  I love cardio-kickboxing, but this one is a bit too complicated in the combinations (and this is coming from a Step instructor!).  I don't feel like she focuses on form enough, either, so I worry about people injuring themselves without proper form and trying to follow tricky steps. If you like Amy, try her Boot Camp DVD...it's a real butt-kicker too, but easier to follow.",1243468800,10,450,4.818181818181818
3085646,5,B0012909QS,"I'm an intermediate exerciser.  I've been cardio kickboxing for many years.  I think this is a challenging, but rewarding workout.  The moves aren't that difficult, but it did take replaying certain combos the first few times I did them because of the quick changes.  Once you know the workout, the cues are sufficient.  I like that you can play the workout the whole way through, or pick ""mixes"" based on the time you want to work out (36, 45, 74 minutes for example) or the type of workout you want to do (all combo, all intervals, or mixes of the two, etc).  There are some special sections, one with a workout bag that you can do with or without one, one section uses a body band for some core work, and two cool down sections.  Even though there are two cool down sections, I thought they were short and didn't really stretch the legs enough, considering the intensity of the workout. However, you can always do your own stretches. The warm up is a good one.

It may be difficult for someone new to kickboxing to catch on to the moves, but the most interesting thing about this dvd is that the woman doing the modifications is pregnant.  Yes, that's right, she is pregnant.  I'm not sure why they chose a pregnant woman to do the beginner modifications, but if a pregnant woman can do it so can you!  Now don't let the thought of a pregant woman fool you into thinking this workout is easy.  I definitely have felt an improvement in my cardio and some weight loss, since starting to use this DVD.  I will definitely try more of Amy Bento's workouts in the future.",1243036800,,1568,4.421602787456446
3085667,2,B0012909QS,"Mine is the perspective of a 26 year-old guy who works out 30 minutes to an hour every day, who loves cardio kickboxing and bootcamp/interval training. So, I was really looking forward to trying this DVD when I got it from Netflix, since Bento combines kickboxing cardio with intervals (presumably of plyometrics). In some ways, I was very impressed, but ultimately the flaws of this workout hinder it from taking a role in my regular routine.

On the good side, the intensity level is right where it should be. Bento's regimen is intense enough for a person of moderate to advanced fitness. Her style reminds me a lot of Cathe Fredreich, whose cardio kickboxing offering (""Kick, Punch, and Crunch"") is one of my favorites. While this is generally a good thing (she has a similar attitude and style, which is to my liking), I also somehow felt like maybe she was trying to copy Cathe... but, then again, it could just as well be the other way around for all I know. Bento's moves are diverse and compelling, and her various intervals really get you moving, breathing, and sweating. Her approach to kickboxing is more in-depth and perhaps even maybe a bit more authentic (using the word ""authentic"" with a wide degree of latitude). I'm willing to bet that there are more real moves borrowed from actual kickboxing in Bento's routine than in Billy Blanks or any others I've tried. But, in a moment I'll explain how all this is a moot point.

What I was most impressed with, however, was the DVD itself. I've absolutely never seen a fitness DVD that made such excellent use of DVD technology. The workout is, all-in-all, well over an hour long. It consists of a fairly lengthy program that proceeds from warm-up to cool down, as you might expect. But most fitness programs only use chapters to divide the major parts of the workout (ie: ""warm-up"", ""cardio"", ""cool down"", etc). Bento's intuitive design breaks the workout up into individual routines, small sets that allow the user to jump between various combos and sections. So, for example, if there's a particular combo that's too intense or not intense enough for you, skip it. If you have favorite sections, pick and choose and re-order the workout to meet your desires. If the workout is too long, skip around and just do some of the routines and when you feel tired skip to the end. If you finish and still feel like you want more, you can easily skip back to whatever particular excursive you want to revisit.

The best thing, though, is that they include a special feature called ""NRG Remixes"". These are alternate playlists that rearrange the sequence of the routines and tailor them to particular needs. This is a great idea and should be the future of fitness programs. For example, there first NRG Remix is ""quick"" and cuts out several routines to cut the total time almost in half while still being fairly intense. There are various other ""levels"", too, so you can work your way up to doing the full workout with all the routines. These also change the order of sequences to mix up your workouts, keep things a bit interesting, and challenge your muscles by limiting repetition. This would work even better as Video on Demand, because they could use a larger number of routines and essentially randomly mix workout routines on the fly. But I digress. I hope more fitness instructors adopt this format.

Alas, all the great things about this DVD and the workout itself are overshadowed by a huge flaw that other reviewers have already pointed out: the routines are just too complicated and hard to follow. There is a huge learning curve. Every workout routine that includes new moves is going to take a little getting used to, but Bento uses very intricate and convoluted combinations and sets of moves that are just frustrating to keep up with--not because they are necessarily so physically taxing, but because they are hard to remember and repeat without error. They also demand a great deal of balance and coordination. Bento often strings together several different sequences of moves and then alternates them in ways that I found confusing and annoying. This is really not necessary, since it's perfectly challenging (perhaps more so) to do one intense small set of moves and then move to another. Bento seems bent on turning my kickboxing workout into a lesson in choreography, which just slows me down and keeps me from getting my heart rate up as high as I could otherwise. After about 30 minutes, I gave up trying to follow yet another series of complex moves that required way too much space, memory, and coordination for me. This might be appealing to those that like something akin to dance, but that's not me.

Also, Bento compounds this flaw by not building up her moves slowly enough so that new users can catch on and follow along. She's not a good instructor, in that she doesn't ever stop to explain proper form, help you get the moves down, or even to adequately explain what it is that she wants you to do.

I've been doing kickboxing workouts for over 2 years now with series from at least 4 or 5 different popular fitness personalities, and I've never been this annoyed trying to follow along with an instructor. If I could ever actually get the sequences down, then I might enjoy this workout and I'd love the DVD. But, who wants to keep trying the same workout DVD over and over again trying to remember the overly complicated sequences of various punches and kicks? In the mean time, you'll just be constantly confused rather than energized and pumped: ""wait, we're on that side now??"" ""!#$@, now we're kicking again?"", ""UGH! Which side are we on???"" ""Which leg is doing what now???""... and so on ad infinitum.

In the end, what could have been a GREAT workout DVD is instead reduced the equivalent of trying to play Simon, and it's hard to get a good workout when you're constantly yelling at the TV and getting angry that you're on the wrong side or that you've missed yet another transition.",1241654400,61,5980,4.711281070745698
3085668,5,B0012909QS,"This DVD is amazing and I love how quickly Amy get's into the routines.  This is not for beginners and not for those who have not been working out in awhile.  I can only last 15 min without a break (my heart rate monitor agrees), and I workout EVERYDAY!  I love that it keeps moving and it keeps that pace, I hate DVD's that spend more time showing how to do the workout than actually giving you a workout.  I feel like I'm right in the gym with this DVD and as a trainer, that's what I was looking for.  You do need to give yourself enough space in your home.  I don't have much space so I don't do all the walking side to side and forward and back, but you can always mimic the moves.  I think the other best part about this DVD is that kickboxing is CARDIO!  We all hate the treadmill or like me, running in general, and kickboxing was my alternate way of getting in my cardio when I couldn't make it to the gym.

Like I said, NOT FOR BEGINNERS.  Lots of people don't like this DVD because they can't follow her quick movements and no instructions.  If you workout daily and pick up quickly on movements, or even just wants to learn some moves that may come in handy, this is it!  Love it!

It took me four or five times before I got the workout down without having to pause and rewind, but now that I know the entire routine, I love how it flows together without the breakdowns.

This one is fun, but it does require a bit of space, which is why I didn't  give it a full five stars.  (For instance, I work out in a spare bedroom, and I have to keep the closet door open so I have more room to do my side kicks.  I also can't take as many steps front and back as Amy does.)  I also feel like Amy is more serious in this kickboxing workout than in her In the Ring workout, so I tend to do that one more often since it's more fun for me.

Overall, it's a tough, fun workout, and a serious calorie torcher!",1227052800,,844,3.988095238095238
3085675,5,B0012909QS,I love this exercise DVD.  It is A LOT of hard work but the time passes quickly because it is fun to do.  The choreography is a little tricky the first few times but that's part of what I like.  Exercise DVD's get boring quickly once you have them totally mastered.  I workout regularly and I am in pretty good shape but I do have to slow it down once in awhile with this DVD. I find Amy Bento very encouraging and straigh-forward. If you want a good kickboxing workout with new and unique combinations I highly recommend this one.,1225929600,,531,4.28
3085676,5,B0012909QS,"I'll be the first to admit that I really don't like kickboxing workouts with a hi/lo flair, but this workout is amazing.  It is intense and extremely fun after you get the hang of it.  I agree that advanced exercisers love workouts that don't have a lot of breakdown because after a while you just get tired of hearing it.  It took me a while to buy this workout, but I'm so glad I finally did.  It's one of my favorites.",1221609600,,421,4.160493827160494
3320082,5,B0012909QS,This workout is not for beginners! This is ADVANCED. One thing most advanced exercisers appreciate is the combos not being broken down too much. After you get them down you can just cruise through the workout without slowing down from then on. Amy is great with creating choreography that is FUN and intense. And I'm not usually one to enjoy much choreography. This is one of my all time favorite kickboxing videos. It may take you once or twice to get it down totally but that won't keep you from getting a great workout til then. Just keep trying its worth it! The music is great and energizing as well. Amy has a fun personality.,1215129600,,632,4.504347826086956
3320083,1,B0012909QS,"My dvd is practically brand new. I only used it once and will never again. I was able to follow along the warm up just fine, but anything past that, forget it! There is absolutely NO cueing, she rapidly changes moves with no warning and throws out terms that i have never heard before. It was impossible to follow along. Absolutely a waste of money!",1214179200,9,349,4.384615384615385
3320114,5,B0012909QS,"I am SO glad that I did not let the reviews on here *SCARE ME* from ordering this DVD! As others have written, if you are experienced in kickboxing, this workout will not only challenge you, but provide you with an excellent calorie burn, along with great results to your physique. The moves are complex (not all), approximately 50% are complex. After completing this video for the 3rd time (just this morning) I was able to keep up with 90% of the workout AND I burned almost 600 calories in 81 minutes (total length of workout). This is a great workout to do on a weekend or day when you are off work. I do this on Saturday or Sunday, first thing in the morning, so I can devote my time to completing the entire workout and focusing on the exercises, without having to rush through it. If you have some ""rhythm"" lol, and enjoy a challenging workout, that is effective in buring calories, then don't listen to negative reviews - GO FOR IT!! :-)If you don't ""pick it up"" the first time, keep doing it, you will pick up the moves, the more you do the workout!",1356739200,,1058,4.348484848484849
3320115,5,B0012909QS,"If you are experienced with kickboxing, do not let the reviews on here scare you. The choreography is complex but by no means inaccessible.  I watched the DVD once, and after a couple of times through at a slow pace I had it down.  This DVD is very appropriate for advanced users because Amy doesn't waste time slowly talking through and breaking down the moves, which annoys me with a lot of other DVDs.  Besides, who wants to waste money on a DVD you can do perfectly the first time through?  I have trouble finding a video that gives me an adequate challenge, but Amy's videos always give me something to strive for.
The DVD has five combos and five surges.  The full routine has combo 1, surge 1, combo 2, surge 2, then 1 and 2 together, followed by combo 3, surge 3, combo 4, surge 4, 3 and 4 together, and finally combo 5, surge 5, then a full run of sequence 5 (combo and surge together).  Then there several ""mixes,"" which recombine the combos and surges into shorter workouts.  I prefer to start off with the full routine and skip around rather than select one of the premixes.  The way the DVD is recorded this is very easy to do, and more often than not I realize that I'm having so much fun I want to do the whole thing anyway.
The combos are punch/kick drills that have a lot of variety (front, back, and side kicks, jabs, crosses, hooks, elbows, jawbreakers, speedbags, jump kicks, knees, ducks, etc).  The surges are mostly varieties of jump kicks but include punching as well.
There are a few things about this workout that make me love it more than others I have.  For one thing I like that there is a lot of footwork.  In a lot of kickboxing DVDs I feel like I'm standing in one spot doing the moves, but Amy has you shuffling around and really using the floorspace.  Even if you don't have a lot of room you can shuffle in place and get an awesome bonus to your workout.  The other aspect of this DVD I love is that it is extremely adaptable.  It seems like whether I am in the mood for something really challenging or need to take a light day I can follow this workout.  It's easy to take it up a notch and throw in a lot of jumps and put some bounce in your shuffle if you want intensity.  But when I had a foot injury this DVD saved my sanity because I was able to do it and have a lot of fun just by staying grounded and cutting out the jumps.
All in all, if you like kickboxing you want this DVD.  The moves aren't like anything you'll find in other DVDs, it's a lot of fun, and despite what you'll read on here it's pretty easy to follow.  Give it a chance and you won't be disappointed!",1335744000,5,2612,4.19
3320116,3,B0012909QS,"This was the first DVD from Amy Bentos I have ever ordered and I must say I was very disappointed.  I ordered it because I generally love kick boxing moves AND it was a long workout however I was so frustrated because I couldn't keep up with her.  By the time I finally did get the hang of a sequence, she was on to another and so I don't feel I got the heart pumping I was use to with The FIRM DVD's I have or Jillian.",1327881600,2,419,3.8045977011494254
3320117,4,B0012909QS,"I was warned by previous reviews of this product that ""Xtreme"" was demonstrated not only in the intensity of this workout, but also in complexity. My review is no different. Yes, Bento ramps up the cardio training with high-energy combos and intervals. This is definitely an endurance challenge. HOWEVER, at the same time, Bento's combinations have no sense of progression. Instead, they basically go from complex to even more complex. It can be a little frustrating at first, especially for beginners. But, I am sure that doing this workout repeatedly will make things easier. Even advanced kickboxing lovers (e.g. those who have done workouts like Billy Blanks many times) will have trouble. Regardless of her fast pace, I recommend this video because of Bento's intense, non-stop cardio drills. Just, be patient with yourself!",1320969600,,829,5.2406015037593985
3320118,5,B0012909QS,"This is a high impact, high intensity long workout filled with fun, high energy choreography.  Lots of jump kicks and jumping in general. You definitely feel like you've given your all when you're done. I was at a full tilt sweat after the warm up. :) I like that she does not slow down to teach the steps so that once you learn them, you don't have to slow down every time you use the dvd.  She does break up the steps into groups, though, which helps. It also helps to have experience following choreography. I also like that the workout is seamless- you don't have to stop and select another segment to get a long enough workout like with many other workout videos.  It does have the additional boxing segment, though, for people who have boxing equipment, and a stretching segment.

 Unfortunately, I had stabbing pains in my feet, ankles, and hips after a couple of days, but I did already have lots of joint problems to begin with. She does have a pregnant lady who does the workout with a few modifications.  This is no ordinary pregnant lady, though- she's majorly tough! It's very motivating because you think in your mind, ""I should be able to do that!"" Do NOT do this workout, even with the modifications, if you are pregnant or injury prone.  Stick with Walking with Leslie Sansone if that is the case. All in all, it's a great workout for someone looking for a real challenge and the music's good, too.",1303862400,,1415,4.50390625
3320119,5,B0012909QS,"I have been doing this workout three days a week for three weeks now, and I no longer make any mistakes.  It takes time to learn the routines, yes, but that's because it is a nonstop cardio workout that unlike so many other workouts of its kind does not get boring.  It has to be complex to prevent boredom for me, and this DVD delivers.  Yes, at first it was complex and a bit hard to follow, but I was expecting much worse after reading the reviews here.  If you focus, do it several times a week and are an experienced exerciser, you will have it down in no time.

This DVD is NOT FOR BEGINNERS.  If you don't know basic kickboxing and need instruction on proper form for punches and kicks, go buy something simpler, because Amy does not explain them, and that is just fine by me.  There is nothing more annoying to the intermediate to advanced exerciser that having to go through slow, boring repetitions of learning basic moves.  That is not what I wanted, and this DVD won't do it.  You will not slow your heart rate while the instructor explains things for beginners, which is why this workout is so effective.

I was also surprised that people said this DVD had bad cuing on the part of Amy Bento - I think the cues are perfect considering the speed at which the workout is moving.  Amy does a great job at keeping things moving while giving good instruction and cues.

You will sweat and burn calories like crazy with this video, and if you take the time to do it repeatedly, you will catch on to the moves quickly.  Great workout and it will stay in my regular rotation for a long time.",1301097600,,1596,4.315436241610739

All the girls wear matching workout wear have smiles pasted on their faces and the heaviest girl of the bunch is the one who will be doing the ""modified"" version. It felt like high school.

The workout consists of:
**5 kickbox sections, with each section followed by an intensity blast.
**a core section
**a relaxing stretch.

There's also a bonus heavy bag section and lots of premixes.  You will never get bored with this workout!

What I loved about this workout:

**the music keeps you smiling and moving.  I'm just as energized on the 5th section as I am when I start the workout.
**the wonderful stretch that includes a little tai chi, some gentle yoga stretches and some general stretches.  I tend to skip the last stretch when I'm short on time, but I always look forward to this stretch.
**Amy's teaching style.  She breaks down part of a move, goes on to the rest of the routine and then puts it all together.  You then do 2 sections together, so you can further practice the moves.
**the quasi-complex moves. I love routines that make me think and this workout does just that.  The moves are terribly complicated, but they're a bit more involved than hook, upper cut, punch, punch.

I must say, I'm so glad I did. This time, I was able to follow along quite well with just a few modifications and was amazed with Amy's perfect, careful cueing. How could I miss this before? I think I wasn't listening. If you pay attention, you will be able to follow and get a fabulous, fun, sweat-filled workout, plus you'll feel accomplished being able to do it. I also added weighted gloves to increase the intensity. If you like Tap Less-Step More, Seasun Zieger workouts, and Amy's newer hi/lo and kickboxing DVDs, you will be able to do this.

I don't feel like she focuses on form enough, either, so I worry about people injuring themselves without proper form and trying to follow tricky steps. If you like Amy, try her Boot Camp DVD...it's a real butt-kicker too, but easier to follow.",1243468800,10,450,4.818181818181818
3320143,5,B0012909QS,"I'm an intermediate exerciser.  I've been cardio kickboxing for many years.  I think this is a challenging, but rewarding workout.  The moves aren't that difficult, but it did take replaying certain combos the first few times I did them because of the quick changes.  Once you know the workout, the cues are sufficient.  I like that you can play the workout the whole way through, or pick ""mixes"" based on the time you want to work out (36, 45, 74 minutes for example) or the type of workout you want to do (all combo, all intervals, or mixes of the two, etc).  There are some special sections, one with a workout bag that you can do with or without one, one section uses a body band for some core work, and two cool down sections.  Even though there are two cool down sections, I thought they were short and didn't really stretch the legs enough, considering the intensity of the workout. However, you can always do your own stretches. The warm up is a good one.

It may be difficult for someone new to kickboxing to catch on to the moves, but the most interesting thing about this dvd is that the woman doing the modifications is pregnant.  Yes, that's right, she is pregnant.  I'm not sure why they chose a pregnant woman to do the beginner modifications, but if a pregnant woman can do it so can you!  Now don't let the thought of a pregant woman fool you into thinking this workout is easy.  I definitely have felt an improvement in my cardio and some weight loss, since starting to use this DVD.  I will definitely try more of Amy Bento's workouts in the future.",1243036800,,1568,4.421602787456446
3320164,2,B0012909QS,"Mine is the perspective of a 26 year-old guy who works out 30 minutes to an hour every day, who loves cardio kickboxing and bootcamp/interval training. So, I was really looking forward to trying this DVD when I got it from Netflix, since Bento combines kickboxing cardio with intervals (presumably of plyometrics). In some ways, I was very impressed, but ultimately the flaws of this workout hinder it from taking a role in my regular routine.

On the good side, the intensity level is right where it should be. Bento's regimen is intense enough for a person of moderate to advanced fitness. Her style reminds me a lot of Cathe Fredreich, whose cardio kickboxing offering (""Kick, Punch, and Crunch"") is one of my favorites. While this is generally a good thing (she has a similar attitude and style, which is to my liking), I also somehow felt like maybe she was trying to copy Cathe... but, then again, it could just as well be the other way around for all I know. Bento's moves are diverse and compelling, and her various intervals really get you moving, breathing, and sweating. Her approach to kickboxing is more in-depth and perhaps even maybe a bit more authentic (using the word ""authentic"" with a wide degree of latitude). I'm willing to bet that there are more real moves borrowed from actual kickboxing in Bento's routine than in Billy Blanks or any others I've tried. But, in a moment I'll explain how all this is a moot point.

What I was most impressed with, however, was the DVD itself. I've absolutely never seen a fitness DVD that made such excellent use of DVD technology. The workout is, all-in-all, well over an hour long. It consists of a fairly lengthy program that proceeds from warm-up to cool down, as you might expect. But most fitness programs only use chapters to divide the major parts of the workout (ie: ""warm-up"", ""cardio"", ""cool down"", etc). Bento's intuitive design breaks the workout up into individual routines, small sets that allow the user to jump between various combos and sections. So, for example, if there's a particular combo that's too intense or not intense enough for you, skip it. If you have favorite sections, pick and choose and re-order the workout to meet your desires. If the workout is too long, skip around and just do some of the routines and when you feel tired skip to the end. If you finish and still feel like you want more, you can easily skip back to whatever particular excursive you want to revisit.

The best thing, though, is that they include a special feature called ""NRG Remixes"". These are alternate playlists that rearrange the sequence of the routines and tailor them to particular needs. This is a great idea and should be the future of fitness programs. For example, there first NRG Remix is ""quick"" and cuts out several routines to cut the total time almost in half while still being fairly intense. There are various other ""levels"", too, so you can work your way up to doing the full workout with all the routines. These also change the order of sequences to mix up your workouts, keep things a bit interesting, and challenge your muscles by limiting repetition. This would work even better as Video on Demand, because they could use a larger number of routines and essentially randomly mix workout routines on the fly. But I digress. I hope more fitness instructors adopt this format.

Alas, all the great things about this DVD and the workout itself are overshadowed by a huge flaw that other reviewers have already pointed out: the routines are just too complicated and hard to follow. There is a huge learning curve. Every workout routine that includes new moves is going to take a little getting used to, but Bento uses very intricate and convoluted combinations and sets of moves that are just frustrating to keep up with--not because they are necessarily so physically taxing, but because they are hard to remember and repeat without error. They also demand a great deal of balance and coordination. Bento often strings together several different sequences of moves and then alternates them in ways that I found confusing and annoying. This is really not necessary, since it's perfectly challenging (perhaps more so) to do one intense small set of moves and then move to another. Bento seems bent on turning my kickboxing workout into a lesson in choreography, which just slows me down and keeps me from getting my heart rate up as high as I could otherwise. After about 30 minutes, I gave up trying to follow yet another series of complex moves that required way too much space, memory, and coordination for me. This might be appealing to those that like something akin to dance, but that's not me.

Also, Bento compounds this flaw by not building up her moves slowly enough so that new users can catch on and follow along. She's not a good instructor, in that she doesn't ever stop to explain proper form, help you get the moves down, or even to adequately explain what it is that she wants you to do.

I've been doing kickboxing workouts for over 2 years now with series from at least 4 or 5 different popular fitness personalities, and I've never been this annoyed trying to follow along with an instructor. If I could ever actually get the sequences down, then I might enjoy this workout and I'd love the DVD. But, who wants to keep trying the same workout DVD over and over again trying to remember the overly complicated sequences of various punches and kicks? In the mean time, you'll just be constantly confused rather than energized and pumped: ""wait, we're on that side now??"" ""!#$@, now we're kicking again?"", ""UGH! Which side are we on???"" ""Which leg is doing what now???""... and so on ad infinitum.

In the end, what could have been a GREAT workout DVD is instead reduced the equivalent of trying to play Simon, and it's hard to get a good workout when you're constantly yelling at the TV and getting angry that you're on the wrong side or that you've missed yet another transition.",1241654400,61,5980,4.711281070745698
3320165,5,B0012909QS,"This DVD is amazing and I love how quickly Amy get's into the routines.  This is not for beginners and not for those who have not been working out in awhile.  I can only last 15 min without a break (my heart rate monitor agrees), and I workout EVERYDAY!  I love that it keeps moving and it keeps that pace, I hate DVD's that spend more time showing how to do the workout than actually giving you a workout.  I feel like I'm right in the gym with this DVD and as a trainer, that's what I was looking for.  You do need to give yourself enough space in your home.  I don't have much space so I don't do all the walking side to side and forward and back, but you can always mimic the moves.  I think the other best part about this DVD is that kickboxing is CARDIO!  We all hate the treadmill or like me, running in general, and kickboxing was my alternate way of getting in my cardio when I couldn't make it to the gym.

Like I said, NOT FOR BEGINNERS.  Lots of people don't like this DVD because they can't follow her quick movements and no instructions.

She isn't in it for the ""cute"" of it.  She works hard and she will work you hard. As it was mentioned before, her form isn't exactly the best, and I wish she would coach more on that especially if you are not familiar with correct form, but if you haven't done kickboxing before you probably shouldn't be choosing this wo anyway!",1231718400,,488,4.126315789473685
3320171,4,B0012909QS,"As a previous reviewer mentioned, this is definitely an advanced workout, and there is not a lot of breaking down of each segment.  It took me four or five times before I got the workout down without having to pause and rewind, but now that I know the entire routine, I love how it flows together without the breakdowns.

This one is fun, but it does require a bit of space, which is why I didn't  give it a full five stars.  (For instance, I work out in a spare bedroom, and I have to keep the closet door open so I have more room to do my side kicks.  I also can't take as many steps front and back as Amy does.)  I also feel like Amy is more serious in this kickboxing workout than in her In the Ring workout, so I tend to do that one more often since it's more fun for me.

Overall, it's a tough, fun workout, and a serious calorie torcher!",1227052800,,844,3.988095238095238
3320172,5,B0012909QS,I love this exercise DVD.  It is A LOT of hard work but the time passes quickly because it is fun to do.  The choreography is a little tricky the first few times but that's part of what I like.  Exercise DVD's get boring quickly once you have them totally mastered.  I workout regularly and I am in pretty good shape but I do have to slow it down once in awhile with this DVD. I find Amy Bento very encouraging and straigh-forward. If you want a good kickboxing workout with new and unique combinations I highly recommend this one.,1225929600,,531,4.28
3320173,5,B0012909QS,"I'll be the first to admit that I really don't like kickboxing workouts with a hi/lo flair, but this workout is amazing.  It is intense and extremely fun after you get the hang of it.  I agree that advanced exercisers love workouts that don't have a lot of breakdown because after a while you just get tired of hearing it.  It took me a while to buy this workout, but I'm so glad I finally did.  It's one of my favorites.",1221609600,,421,4.160493827160494

It keeps me on my toes and doesn't get boring. The time flew by and the DVD is long enough that I feel like I'm getting in a good workout.  Also, the workout itself is tough, but without being so hard you dread doing it.  I'm looking forward to pushing play many more times so I can learn the choreography.  Other reviews are correct that this is not a beginners workout!  And if you don't like challenging choreography, don't buy it.",1454371200,,580,4.314814814814815

8244753,5,B0012909QS,I loved this dvd!  I enjoy kickboxing and find that Amy really knows how to cue and build upon moves where even a clumsy person like me can catch on!  You will work up a sweat and challenge both you mind and body.  I'm definitely going to buy more fitness videos from Amy Bento.

8244754,5,B0012909QS,I love this work out ! I would suggest watching it first . I had a few stops and starts the first 2 times I did it while learning the moves and getting accustomed to the cueing.  It's a fast paced hard workout that is challenging,1421539200,,229,3.9782608695652173
8244755,3,B0012909QS,"I have a fair amount of workout videos ranging from P90X and Insanity to Jillian Michaels, Biggest Loser, Bob Harper, etc. I found this video to be a good workout. While I am accustomed to following a routine and essentially choreography, I found it to be a bit difficult to predict or keep up with the instructor's next move. It didn't ""flow"" as nicely as I had expected. Will the video get your heartrate up? I'd say so. As long as you are moving and your heart rate is up, that's all that really matters. Would I recommend it over my other videos? No. I would recommend looking into Jillian's kickboxing video. I purchased this to try to add variety.",1414886400,2,653,4.45
8244756,5,B0012909QS,"I choose this rating because of the challenging levels in this DVD. I have never seen Amy Bento's routine before but I am hooked!! Each Combo and interval is such a great workout, I really worked hard to keep up with her. Love Love! I recommend this dvd to an intermediate level person familiar with kickboxing and anyone who loves to exercise...What a great way to work off some steam!",1392681600,,386,4.5285714285714285
8244757,5,B0012909QS,"First, a little background about me, which will hopefully help you put my review into perspective:  I'm 24 years old and regularly work out to videos featuring such fitness queens as Cathe Friedrich, Kelly Coffey Meyer, Michelle Dozois, and Jillian Michaels. I've also done Insanity and really enjoyed the interval training and plyometrics. In other words, I gravitate toward workout videos that are more athletic and intense.

Given these fitness predilections, I expected to love Amy's Kickbox Xtreme, and I wasn't disappointed. At first the sheer duration of the workout intimidated me a little, as I had done Amy's Kickbox Surge & Core Training already and knew that the workout would be 60+ minutes of *nonstop* work, unlike some workouts that purport to push you hard but actually fill up 1/4 of the time with chatter while you stare at the screen. However, once I got started, the duration was the last thing on my mind; Amy sets up this workout in such a way that the time simply flies by.

You start with about 10 minutes of a high-energy warm-up, and then Amy takes you through 5 combos. Each combo is followed by an interval (higher intensity ""surge"" of cardio, though I wouldn't call this plyometrics - it's not quite explosive enough to qualify). You'll do combo 1, then combo 2, then 1 and 2 together (including the surges). Then combo 3 followed by combo 4, and then string 3 and 4 together. Lastly, Amy takes you through combo 5.

There is a 5-min. core section at the end which uses resistance bands (I subbed dumbbells) and a step (not necessary - you only use it to increase your range of movement for Supermans). This section alone isn't great for core work, but it's a good 5-min section to cap off the intense workout. I don't think I could have handled anything longer or more difficult after the 60 minutes of pure cardio.",1388966400,,1846,4.688271604938271
