3872672,4,B0028FGSQ0,"Ben's back in another DVD with 5 episodes from the second season.  They include ""Alone Together"" where Ben and a Highbreed get stranded, ""Good Copy, Bad Copy"" when Ben meets a clone of himself wielding its OWN Omnitrix, and ""Save the Last Dance"" where Kevin attempts to go to the prom with Gwen but he gets sidetracked.

The special feature is a sneak peek of brand new characters - some of which are introduced in this DVD.

Ben, Gwen, and Kevin know that there's more adventures to come and frankly, it'll be chronicled on the next DVD.  Keep watching Cartoon Network for more new episodes as well as the new movie ""Ben 10 Alien Swarm"" !",1259625600,2,639,4.482758620689655
