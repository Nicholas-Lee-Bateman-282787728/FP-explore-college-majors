4572723,4,B00559SGFC,"This is a very very good movie that really shows Chinese culture. The reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I was told when I was getting it that it was dubbed but when I got it, the movie was mandarin chinese with english subtitles.",1360454400,4,239,4.0
4572724,5,B00559SGFC,This movie was amazing! The songs were great and it was way better than our high school musical! There was more of a connection between the characters!,1356652800,,151,4.62962962962963
4572725,4,B00559SGFC,"Ok, so I love this movie, but it is not so great for little kids, one it says a bad word twice though it's rated G, and you have to be able to read. But, all and all, it is a great movie, I think that these actors may dance better, and maybe sing better. I love it and ya'll!",1338163200,,275,3.6
4572726,5,B00559SGFC,"I bought this movie to use with my middle school students. Every other month we watch a foreign film. This has definately been the best one so far. It will definately spark a discussion about the differences in culture between the east and west! For example, the parents of one of the main characters move so that their daughter can live closer to her school. The story is centered around the students finding balance between their studies and their love of dancing/music. It is completely different from the American version, in which the academics seem to take a backseat, and the parents have no real role (with the exception of basketball coach, who is also a dad). The parents in this version have real roles, and even sing. My students loved this, and begged to me to let them watch it again. I was sad that I had to say no. Warning: the songs are pretty cheesy sometimes, but at the same time very catchy. This also does not seem to be a ""made for tv"" movie like the first HSM was. The scope of this is larger. They obviously had a big budget for sets/choreography/costuming etc. I definately recommend, especially if you are looking for a good movie for your students. My tenth grade students also really enjoyed this movie.",1330560000,17,1232,4.579185520361991
4572753,3,B00559SGFC,This is a staged (not real natural) presentation. It's like a modern version of Chinese musical. Some good humor from a Chinese humor viewpoint. I only gave it 3 stars because I feel that it paints a picture of fame and riches that is not realistic. Is that Disney?,1408320000,,265,4.428571428571429
4572754,1,B00559SGFC,This movie is something I frown upon.  Its taking the best movie in the world and beating it down.  I would not buy this movie ever.,1407715200,,132,4.038461538461538
4572755,5,B00559SGFC,This movie was a lot of fun to watch and had some really entertaining characters as well as a good plot. It had similarities to the American version like the male lead played basketball in both but it also had it's differences. An example of one of the differences was the fact that his best friend actually encouraged him in his singing and supported him with the singing contest.,1398643200,,381,4.536231884057971
4572756,5,B00559SGFC,"I showed this to my after school Chinese kids at the community center.  They loved it.  So did I.  Pretty predictable plot, but it is a kids movie after all. I have watched it a few times, and it gets better each time.  Guo Degang has a brief role, and he is really funny. The best thing-- there is no swearing, no potty jokes.  Kids respect their teachers and parents.  How about that?",1387411200,3,386,4.219178082191781
4572757,3,B00559SGFC,"The whole family sat down and all agreed that it was not as good as we had hoped for. We had previously seen Disney's 'Rock It' which is a High School Musical type story set in Germany and loved it. I am not sure why they have not made that one available in the US. The cast in the China version was good, but the writing was lacking in our opinion. We watch a lot of dramas from Korea, Japan and China and this movie just wasn't up to the same level.",1385251200,3,451,3.9130434782608696
4572758,4,B00559SGFC,"I am currently showing this to my beginning Chinese class at a high school in South Carolina.  They love it!  Some of them say they enjoyed it more than the American version.  High School Musical China uses many similar themes as the original movie.  It also has half a dozen or so unique and fun characters.  It is interesting to compare the cultural values, as well.  One of the first songs in the movie, which takes place in a classroom and is led by the teacher, is about the importance of math and its relevance to everyday life.  This was quite different from some of the values presented in the original movie.  Basically, it is a fun movie and good for understanding Chinese teen culture and for expanding your language skills.",1381622400,2,735,4.557251908396947
4572759,5,B00559SGFC,Was pleasantly surprised to see the Chinese version of the popular High School Musical.  Enjoyed the glimpse of modern China and those talented kids were fun to watch.,1378598400,,167,4.964285714285714

4572761,4,B00559SGFC,"It moved at a fast past with lots of activity going on. The dancing was great, the actors were great, and I really liked how they had their ending number the same as High School Musical 1 but with different lyrics.",1367366400,,214,4.2439024390243905
4572762,5,B00559SGFC,The plot-line of HSM makes a lot more sense in this context than in the US. That's why I appreciate this movie more than the original.,1362441600,,134,4.1923076923076925

8457712,2,B00559SGFC,"I haven't seen this, and I'm sure it is an amazing movie, but the rating at the top looked a little funny without a two stars.  So I took initiative and did what needed to be done.  Thank you all for your support.",1423180800,,213,3.9302325581395348
8457713,1,B00559SGFC,"I paid to rent this and it is horrible, I am trying to finish watching it but it is terrible, the acting is bad, the singing is bad, it is mostly rap and all it basically sings about is ""do your homework, clean yourself, and do what your told""",1419465600,,243,3.979591836734694
