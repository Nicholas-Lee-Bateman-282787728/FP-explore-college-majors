3445668,4,B001A5ESAC,"My 4 year old son loves snakes so when I was searching for a dvd to get for him to watch, I let him look at various dvd covers on Amazon.  One that he really liked for me to get for him was Best of Dangerous Encounters with Brady Barr.  One episode that my son really likes is called ""Snake Bite"" and it involves Brady getting bitten by a python and he has to go get stiches as a result.  It's amazing to watch and see and it shows how dangerous these creatures can be.  My son really enjoyed watching it and I would recommend getting this dvd just for the episode called ""Snake Bite,"" especially if you want to develop a healthy respect for the ""man eating python,"" as my son calls it.  A truly enjoyable and entertaining dvd that is sure to entertain the snake lover in your family!",1314316800,,784,4.1655629139072845
3445669,5,B001A5ESAC,"Although Brady is a bit eccentric at time the show is great for nature and animal lovers, especially if you like reptiles like Crocs. I enjoy his travels and seeing his antics. This guy has some ba**s if you know what I mean. If you can put on a hippo suit and walk next to live hippos for research your nuts. He does this because he loves the wildlife and a lot of his show has to do with preservation and education regarding venom and species etc. Great show comparable to River Monsters with Jeremy Wade on Discovery .Wish they brought this show back for a new season.",1304035200,,571,4.296296296296297
3445670,5,B001A5ESAC,"- The picture is beautiful and sharp.

- The narrator actively interacted with the animals. He's just not passively filming them. For example, in Snake Bite episode, he entered one of the caves in rain-forest jungle of Indonesia to catch the giant pythons. He waded in bat-dung mud that was hip high. The scene where one of the snakes took a big bite out of his thigh is terrifying.

- The DVD shows some of the species I've never seen before like the almost-extinct crocodiles of China.

- The film poses an interesting question ""Which living animal has the strongest bite?"" The methods used and the journeys taken by Brady to answer this questions are both exciting and suspenseful.

- In short, this 2-discs DVD set is worth every penny. I own it.",1257897600,2,750,4.616541353383458

3445688,5,B001A5ESAC,"This collection of the Best of the Nat Geo TV show, Dangerous Encounters, is easily the most gripping set of adventures ever captured on film. Brady Barr is quite literally, the worlds formost herpitologist. A few of these shows capture instances of life and death events with large crocs and snakes. The best is when Dr. Barr is bitten by a huge python in a cave in Indonesia, in filthy water up to his neck. This is a stunning collection of unscripted, real life addventures with some of the worlds large, dangerous creatures.",1427241600,,528,4.688172043010753
3445689,5,B001A5ESAC,"Folks, this is a hidden gem of comedy history.  Ready made for a SNL skit with Will Ferrell as the overconfident but actually cowardly ""expert"", this episode of Brady Barr being bit by a ""big python, big python"" will have you laughing so hard you will cry.  From the beginning of the episode where he tries to measure the largest python in captivity and gets in over his head to the climax where he is bitten in the cave even though he is pushing his partner toward the snake, you will keep asking yourself ""Is this for real?  Can anyone be this clueless?"" It's like an old cartoon episode of Hong Kong Phooey where the sidekick always saves the day and HKP thinks he's the hero.  Don't miss this as it truly should be a part of the comedy canon.  Aieeeeeghhhhh!!!",1415404800,,764,4.390070921985815
3445690,5,B001A5ESAC,This is a really great movie on snakes and Dr. Brady Barr's exploits in the field and his research. If reptiles are what you like and you enjoy National Geographic then this is the movie for you!,1343692800,,195,4.297297297297297
