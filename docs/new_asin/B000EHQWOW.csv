2520363,5,B000EHQWOW,"""Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater"" produced by Tim Sakamoto is a wonderful walk-through, not of a building, but instead of the mind and heart of an architect who not only dealt in this masterpiece with the relationship of man with himself, with his family, but also his relationship with Nature. This is a creative description of the juxtaposition of contrasting elements that give Fallingwater its splendor.",1202860800,4,409,5.3076923076923075
2520364,5,B000EHQWOW,"This video gives the viewer the opportunity to experience Fallingwater:  the vistas that open up as you move through the house, the close continuous connection between inside and outside between nature and art, the way the house changes from one season to the next.  Definitely the next best thing to having the opportunity to seeing the house in person!",1201910400,11,354,4.983050847457627
2520365,5,B000EHQWOW,"The first disc includes a rich history of this iconic Wright commission, with many historic photos. There are also extended interviews with Lynda Waggoner, the director of Fallingwater, and with Richard Cleary, an architectural historian.

 Waggoner spoke at the recent Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy national meeting about her almost life-long involvement with, and love of, the house. Her enthusiasm for her work is contagious, as she takes us on tour, and talks about the house and its history. Her tour is a good precursor to one's first visit to Fallingwater (the 2008 Conservancy meeting will be at Fallingwater, in September).

 Talking about E.J. Kaufmann and Wright, who sometimes clashed while the house was being built, she says, ""They were similar people. They were both big thinkers, men who liked to make things happen, men who had great vision. What held them together was this shared vision of creating something extraordinary...You don't have to be very knowledgeable about architecture to have the building speak to you personally.""

 She paints vivid word pictures for us (""Suddenly nature is presented to you at the level of a bug. Wright had this unique ability to present nature to us.""). She ends her interview telling us, ""A masterpiece is something that has a timelessness about it...I think Fallingwater is doing well over the test of time...""

 Cleary has a more academic view of the house. Their intimate knowledge of Fallingwater is woven with Sakamoto's photography, which takes us to places we cannot go in person.  The camera is just to our right during the interviews. Cleary and Waggoner tend to look at the camera, rather than at the viewer. We would be drawn into the story of the house even more if they engaged us directly during their interviews.

 The second disc of the set is an interactive visual tour of Fallingwater, including panoramic views of exterior of the house, and of the grounds. The disc includes copies of original plans and presentation drawings, as well as dozens of contemporary photos.",1201651200,18,2054,5.0652818991097925
8110108,4,B000EHQWOW,"Not sure when this was shot, maybe around the mid 90s, and unfortunately that is the problem as it is in the old square format, not widescreen. Would be great if someone updated this with the benefit of HD. Still for anyone who has in an interest in Frank Lloyd Wright and the story of the Kaufman's this is worth the price.",1464998400,,324,4.241935483870968

8110110,4,B000EHQWOW,Same as the Taliesin West set.  If the computer panoramas were in HD it would be worth the cost but not as is.  Wish I'd know this before buying both.  Should just be priced for the cd.,1434499200,,185,3.945945945945946
8110111,3,B000EHQWOW,"This is really an interesting set of information about Fallingwater.  Disk 1 is a DVD Video about Fallingwater, featuring interviews with Lynda Waggoner, the Director of Fallingwater &  Richard Cleary a Professor of Architecture at the University of Texas at Austin, School of Architecture.

Disk 2 is a PC/Mac DVD that lets you do a photo exploration of Fallingwater in a nice little app that places the pictures in the right locations within the house and grounds.

Overall, the information provided is good, solid stuff.  Ms. Waggoner knows Fallingwater well, and is entertaining and informative.  Professor Cleary clearly has a love for the architecture of Wright and provides excellent information.

In between the interviews, the viewer gets to look at still photographs given the ""Ken Burns Treatment"" (the camera zooms in on still photos to give you a sense of motion), and the absolute gem is probably about 1-2 minutes of old home movies taken while Fallingwater was being constructed.

So why the average review?  There's really not much content here that I couldn't find on the web (including the pictures).  In particular, it puzzles me there was no video of the inside of Fallingwater, as Ms. Waggoner would have made a perfect host for this purpose.  There's nothing wrong with the content, there just isn't a lot of it.

If you're considering this video, I would pair it with the Ken Burns special on Frank Lloyd Wright, and add the book ""Fallingwater"" edited Lynda Waggoner available on Amazon as well&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fallingwater-Lynda-Waggoner/dp/0847835995/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fallingwater Lynda Waggoner</a>",1389139200,4,1694,5.57421875

8110113,5,B000EHQWOW,"We were fortunate to be able to visit Falling Water this summer, and this DVD is probably the next best thing to being there.  If you've been there, you will love it for bringing back the memories of this truly special home.  If you haven't been there, this will make you want to go!",1357516800,,283,4.222222222222222
8110114,4,B000EHQWOW,"This is a comprehensive dvd covering the creation to the restoration of Fallingwater. The expert commentary gives you all the information you've ever wanted to learn. My only complaint is that the dvd has almost no actual footage of Fallingwater. It is nearly all photographs, which is quite disappointing to someone like myself who have stared at countless photos, and craved to see (and hear!) Fallingwater alive. I would've loved a slow video walk-through when showing the home instead of step by step photos. Also Lynda Waggoner ends the dvd on a surprisingly negative note. Still a ""must-have"" for Wright fans!",1356393600,2,615,5.099009900990099
