7845563,4,6303356567,"Ballistic is unfortunate in that the parts making it a good film aren't necessarily the ones that B-movie action fans typically find appealing. The amount of time it spends on its characters will make adrenaline junkies itch for action, and when those awaited fight scenes don't blow em away, its easy to be disappointed. Nevertheless, the pictures got charm beyond its means, and its obscurity makes it a rare find for an appreciative fan like me. Despite its price tag, Im sorry I waited so long to get my hands on it.

The story: When a straight-shooting police officer (Marjean Holden,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BeastMaster/dp/B00474XADE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BeastMaster)</a>) is falsely implicated in a murder, she battles time to prove a conspiracy between the department and a sleazy arms dealer (Sam Jones,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flash-Gordon/dp/B0038ZITIE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flash Gordon</a>).

Whats simultaneously infuriating and refreshing about the film is that, even though this is Marjean Holdens sole leading credit, she doesnt hog the spotlight. Its clearly her vehicle, but the amount of prominence given to costars Joel Beeson and Richard Roundtree is surprising. While its easy to write this off as Holden being unable to carry a vehicle by herself, the story highlights the interrelationships between characters and makes what would otherwise be a bunch of stock figures seem interesting and easy to invest in. This isn't a masterpiece of drama, but if more B-movie action yarns spent this much time making you care about the people in it, the genre might have a better reputation. Also, its one of the few films of this sort wherein Richard Roundtree actually earns his highly-placed credit, and for that it deserves praise.

Theres a good amount of action here, mainly in the way of fistfights, but the quality is inconsistent. Holden is a better onscreen fighter than, say, Mimi Lesseos but she doesnt approach Cynthia Rothrocks standard. The late Joel Beeson has at least as many fights as her and is a respectable kickboxer, though nothing out of the ordinary. The brawls range from basic karate-style encounters to pro wrestling-inspired bouts and even the odd weapons-themed showdown. Holdens final opponent is bodybuilder Corinna Everson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Double-Impact/dp/B0000542CD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Double Impact</a>), and while their match is interesting, its not the showstopper you're hoping for. Supplying some much-needed pizzazz is Michael Jai White in a rare indie role wherein he actually fights. White has a few matches and his acrobatic moves vastly outclass those of anyone around him, to the point that you wish hed get an opponent who can keep up with his skill.

Production values are above average for this kind of picture, comparable to a really good PM flick. Its rolling pace and engaging tone make it a good starting point for newcomers to low budget action flicks. Again, viewers who are all about the action might not go for this, but at this point its their loss. Among the hills of schlock and mountains of trash this genre has accumulated, this ones a diamond.",1519862400,,3293,5.659919028340081

7845565,5,6303356567,"I wanted to say that this is one of the most under-rated films in the action genre to come out,,I had it on laser disc and I loved it. I have looked for the dvd for years. Jones is a good villain,Beeson a great fighter and so good to see Richard-Shaft-Roundtree in action,,,and Marjean Holden is great as the heroine and quite beautiful to boot,,,come on release this on dvd or better yet blu ray..",1347494400,2,398,4.32

7845567,5,6303356567,"Ballistic (aka Fist of Justice) is a great showcase for the action prowess of both Marjean Holden (MK: Annihilation, Philadelphia Experiment 2) and Cory Everson (champion bodybuilder and video fitness instructor/producer). Marjean has three classic fight scenes and Cory at least two. This movie ought to be released on DVD! Where else can one see an incredibly foxy black chick in black leather jump kick a corrupt off-duty cop, right after putting him down for playing ""Nintendo""? Or watch as a beautiful blonde bodybuilder in stilleto heels tosses the same dude around (in slow motion, no less) before snapping his neck? Classic early '90s to-video stuff.",1164326400,4,658,5.216981132075472
