8349390,3,B0021SGO7C,I expected more in depth treatment and more pyramid sites in the presentation. I either did not read or a complete description was not given.,1363392000,3,141,4.68
8349391,1,B0021SGO7C,"I was very disappointed by this History Channel production. Although it is entitled ""Mexico's Great Pyramids"", it spends little time on the pyramids themselves or the city known as Teotihuacan.

The DVD begins with the pyramids themselves and the city surrounding the pyramids. The DVD swiftly moves on to wildly speculative conjecture on the nature of the society that flourished there for hundreds of years. I was shocked by how the DVD would literally invent a culture and society from thin air!

After a brief introduction to the pyramids, the video launches into an interpretation of the ""Teotihuacanos"" (because they were a pre-literate people, they left no written history or literature and we don't even know what they called themselves or their city) as a kind of proto-communist society that created a utopian city of social equality...but, with human sacrifice. ""Experts"" speculate that the Teotihuacanos did not develop a writing system because writing systems at that time were tools of kings used to record royal geneologies, wars, diplomacy, etc. and the Teotihuacanos didn't want to be ""elitist"". Much of the video is like this with interviews with ""experts"" who create history ""out of whole cloth"". There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever for the conclusions reached in this DVD!

The video ends with the telling of the confrontation between the Aztecs (who did not build Teotihuacan and never lived there) and the Spanish under Cortez as well as modern mystics meeting at the pyramids at solstices.

The DVD spends little time on the pyramids. It doesn't tell you what they're made of, how large they are, describe the other structures that appear to have had ritual significance in the city, the layout of the city with the ""Avenue of the Dead"" connecting major structures, etc. There was a lot they could have covered and I'm at a loss as to why they would instead launch into a completely phony invented history.

This DVD offers no useful information and instead creates a phony history. This DVD gets one star.",1358121600,4,2036,5.029673590504451
8349392,4,B0021SGO7C,"This program focused on the city of Teotihuacan with the pyramids magnificent as those of Egypt.  It makes one wonder why no writing system left to tell their culture and civilization.  Who were these people with the wisdom, energy and craft in making this city?

It document the pyramids where people come all over for the sun festival, pay tribute and connection with heaven.  Why the ancient practiced human sacrifice? Why they left nothing to tell their story?  Is is the newcomers after Columbus who attempted to control and convert and burn, kill and ransack?  Luckily and unluckily, there were a few items left in cracking the code.

This is a quick tour of this great place with a good introduction to explore and research more on this ancient American civilization prior to Columbus.  It will be a wonderful journey to go for.",1315094400,2,835,4.79020979020979
8349393,3,B0021SGO7C,"Photos were great, dialog was poor. No mention of how they were built, not much was said about the various theories about why it was built, not much said about the people who built it either...",1304380800,4,193,4.388888888888889
8349394,3,B0021SGO7C,"There wasn't a lot of pre - purchase product - description information for this. I'd expected a program dealing with pyramids found all over Mexico (including the Chichen Itza & Ek Balam sites near Cancun). But this program deals exclusively with the Teotihuacan site near Mexico City. Still, not bad for the price.",1296777600,9,315,4.962264150943396
