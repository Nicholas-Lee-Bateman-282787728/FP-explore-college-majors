7539157,5,B0184GSAWG,I always enjoy this series,1474156800,,26,4.4
7539158,5,B0184GSAWG,"It is 1953, the year of the coronation of young Queen Elizabeth II. Bodies practically litter the ground in Father Brown's Kembleford, tucked into the western Cotswold. All the regulars are on hand to help the Father sleuthe: Lady Felicia (prominent parishioner and good friend), Mrs. McCarthy (Father Brown's housekeeper) and Sid Carter (Lady Felicia's loyal chauffeur cum ladies man cum petty criminal). Inspector Sullivan, for whom Father Brown was a thorn in the side for two seasons, has moved on. His replacement, Inspector Mallory is altogether different, sarcastic, bombastic and a bit cartoonish.

I found the Season 4 episodes to be, overall, more improbable than previous seasons. But I also laughed out loud a lot. And the episode ""The Daughter of Autolycus"" has a great plot.

....Episode 1  ""The Mask of the Demon"" Father Brown reads the Gloucester News, where the headline is ""Cardinal Sets Up Studios in the Cotswold."" No, it's not his Cardinal, it's Cardinal Studios, in town to film a Dracula movie. Lady Felicia knows the lead actor and finagles a tour of the set for herself, Father Brown (who loves monster films) and Mrs. McCarthy (who's signed a petition to run the blasphemous film company out of town). Which is why Father Brown is on hand when there's a murder.
....Episode 2  ""The Brewer's Daughter"" Last night, Sid met Grace Fitzgerald, the love of his life (so far), at the pub. After spending the night together at his caravan, she returns home, next to the Brewery her father owns. Except she finds her father dead, and she's sure it was murder.
....Episode 3  ""The Hangman's Demise"" Edie and Henry Lee are celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary with a dinner at the church. Father Brown is happy, ""A most commendable milestone."" Lady Felicia replies, ""I agree, Father. Even if one does get less for manslaughter.""
Henry is a retired hangman. His very last hanging comes back to haunt him, in a most murderous way.
....Episode 4  ""The Crackpot of the Empire"" Two years before, Father Brown assisted in the involuntary commitment of Uncle Mirth, a music hall ventriloquist who lost his way. He's just been released, and has invited Father Brown to a Welcome Home Party. Except it isn't anything like.
This episode has a good take on the ""And Then There Were None"" plot.
....Episode 5  ""The Daughter of Autolycus"" Father Brown is washing dishes in the presbytery, when the radio announcer says, ""The Pope's coronation gift for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth has left Vatican City on the first leg of its journey to London. The Pelagius Cross, a magnificent necklace composed of emeralds and rubies is said to be beyond price."" And the entourage accompanying the gift will be stopping at the Gloucester Diocese! Father Brown's first thought is that this is just the kind of challenge the arch-thief Flambeau will enjoy. And so he is, but not in the way Father Brown suspects. This episode has a GREAT plot! And seeing Father Brown get his way without violating the sanctity of the confession is a treat.
Incidentally, there really was a monk named Pelagius, but its doubtful the Vatican would be bestowing a gift with his name. He was declared a heretic in 415 a.d. for not believing in original sin.
....Episode 6  ""The Rod of Asclepius"" Lady Felicia has a new car, a convertible roadster, and she takes Mrs. McCarthy for a spin. They are bickering back and forth when she runs off the road and hits a tree. Lady Felicia breaks her nose and Mrs. McCarthy has a broken arm. They end up in the hospital next to each other and find themselves investigating a murder.
....Episode 7  ""The Missing Man"" Father Brown is officiating at the wedding of Margaret and Geoffrey le Broc. Yes, her name is already le Broc, because her husband died in the war and now she's marrying her brother-in-law. Except for the fact that her very un-dead husband turns up before the ""I Dos"". How convenient it would be if he dies a second time.
....Episode 8  ""The Resurrectionists"" Young Alexander Moore is killed in a motorcycle accident, his head cut clean off. So it's a closed casket service. The morning after the burial, they find his grave has been robbed. As Father Brown says, ""There's something unpleasant going on here."" And more death on the way.
....Episode 9  ""The Sins of the Fathers"" Everybody looks forward to the annual Kembleford Variety Show. Many egos are involved, to be inflated or deflated. There's some real talent in the area. Such as the young obnoxious pianist, Calvin Twyman. Unfortunately, as the day of the show dawns, he won't be competing. He was strangled at his piano the night before. In a house locked and bolted down from the inside.
....Episode 10 ""The Wrath of Baron Samdi"" A jazz band comes to Kembleford, with a beautiful lead singer, Yveline Lafond. She's just left Haiti to make her way with the band and the band leader who loves her. But she's followed by her ex-boyfriend, who invokes the Vodou spirit, Baron Samdi, to wreak revenge. Or does he?

""Father Brown Season 4"" originally aired in January 2016. The 10 episodes average a bit more than 40 minutes each (without commercials), totaling 442 minutes of mysteries. The BluRay and DVD sets include English SDH subtitles.  There are no Bonus Features.

I used to hope that the length of the Father Brown episodes could be lengthened and give the stories more depth. But now I think that the intent of this series is to remain light with quirky story lines. It isn't a ""Foyle's War"" or even a ""Midsomer Murders"". But I still enjoy it and much appreciate the humor.
4.5 stars rounded up to 5.

My favorite season so far is Season 2:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Father-Brown-Season-Two/dp/B00KJ17HCE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Father Brown: Season Two</a>. Season 5 is in the works, and will include the first ""Father Brown"" Christmas Special.

7539163,3,B0184GSAWG,"Overall I like Father Brown (there have been very good godly moments of showing God's love through this character) and this is the new season on PBS right now and I caught most of #4 (the show according to the TV guide) and was dismayed that they had to get a lesbian message in there (at least, that's how I took it with the little bit I saw). Human hormones get ""excited"" at seeing two dogs ""getting busy"", for God's sake, that doesn't mean humans and dogs should get together and shouldn't be taken as an endorsement for human/animal sex! This is true esp. with the young with hormones surging. It seems Father Brown must endorse homosexual behavior like all entertainment now (a reason why I won't be watching the new season of Grandchester when it is shown on PBS), I think mostly because there are so many homosexuals in the entertainment industry, so their opinions are tainted.",1464393600,19,885,4.6075949367088604

7539195,3,B0184GSAWG,"The earlier seasons were much better. They have an actor playing police inspector Mallory who is terrible.  His acting is so bad, it makes the show far less entertaining. I had to fast forward through his scenes. He is just awful. The character is one dimensional and the actor's hammy, terrible performance just makes it worse.",1492214400,,328,4.857142857142857

Have liked the series so much on PBS that I bought all four seasons. . . which is saying a lot because I'm an atheist Jew!

7539242,5,B0184GSAWG,"The Father Brown series by G.K Chesterton is a very old mystery series updated to the mid 20th century with great attention to costumes, sets and all sorts of period props. Mark Williams is the definitive Father Brown, intelligent, gentle and always hoping to save a soul rather than break the reed. The supporting cast is excellent, each one adding a great deal to the richness of the stories. When Mrs. McCarthy gets hurt, you can't wait for her to get back to the rectory. The aristocratic lady adds class, her chauffeur adds the other side of the culture and knows things that Father Brown shouldn't know about. The police inspector is a bit harsh, considering how many murders in the village have been solved by Father Brown. You'd think he would be grateful. I like the fact that the thief, Flambeau, shows up once in a while and enjoy the sparring between him and Father Brown. I have all 4 series because even if you know 'who-dun-it' the cast and the village is fun to revisit. Highly recommend to those who are addicted to British period mysteries.",1478390400,26,1058,4.632978723404255
7539243,4,B0184GSAWG,"Another very good season of Father Brown -- Mark Williams and cast do a great job.

I thought it was odd, however, that episode 6, ""The Rod of Asclepius,"" adapted plot elements from the classic British mystery from the 40s, GREEN FOR DANGER, starring Alistair Sim and Trevor Howard, without any credit to the screenwriters (Sidney Gilliat and Claud Gurney) or the author of the underlying novel (Christianna Brand).  Possibly there's an explanation for the lack of credit, but there can be no doubt that that's where this plot of this episode came from -- the similarities are so specific that it can't be a coincidence.  (The episode isn't identical in every way to the movie -- the overlap is in what the murderer did.)

In any event, it's a good episode, very entertaining like the others in this series. I'll be looking forward to season 5.",1477180800,6,844,4.72108843537415

8741395,3,B0184GSAWG,"The previous seasons were worth four stars.  This one trailed off in quality, particularly toward the end.  By the last episode, I was predicting to my wife who the murderer was--and was correct--because he was the only light-skinned suspect remaining, and indeed Father Brown somehow knew that the two black characters couldn't possibly be suspects.  But an even bigger problem is that in season four, the main reason Father Brown seemed to be a sleuth was solely because everyone else was so incompetent.  The characterizations were still good, which is why it rates three stars, but once a mystery series reaches this sort of predictability point, it's time to give up on it.  This will be the last season we'll watch.",1522195200,,721,4.925619834710743

8741398,3,B0184GSAWG,"I enjoy Father Brown mysteries. However, these adapters appear to be trying to make them more modern and edgy. Instead they are less interesting. A disappointment when one pays for them.",1518998400,,186,5.032258064516129
