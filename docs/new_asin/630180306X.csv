Terence Knox plays an awesome role as a man on a mission, to avenge his wifes death at the hands of sick criminals. A group of business people on a mountain excursion get mixed up in the middle. Also stars Jerry Travolta.",1266883200,,287,4.236363636363636

Terence Knox is great in this movie.  The ending was different than what I expected.",1019606400,4,305,5.08
