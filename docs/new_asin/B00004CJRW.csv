1340209,3,B00004CJRW,"Ian McKellan made his feature film debut in this sensitive 1981 biographical chronicle of the impassioned, infuriating life of D.H Lawrence.  Janet Suzman, Ava Gardner and John Gielgud co-star.  The clever, often understated direction of Christopher Miles works exceedingly well in creating an authentic feel of another time and place.

Beautifully photographed, we follow the late writer's life beginning in the summer of 1914, just before the First World War when D.H. married his German wife Frieda and moved to Cornwall, England.  The slightly fictionalized life story examines the tumultuous pinnacle of the volatile author's late career as he travels with Frieda to America, Mexico and finally Italy, seeking a quiet place to complete his explosively controversial masterwork, Lady Chatterley's Lover.

Yes, it's an OK movie.  Slimmed down and lush-looking, but it's not a full-bodied D.H. Lawrence.",1319328000,4,905,5.569343065693431

I have loved this movie since it came out and each year have viewed it at least once. At just over two hours, it was well paced, had towering performances- Janet Suzman is magnetic and Ian McKellan quite fine. Now, in its latest incarnation at 99 minutes it is a travesty. It is the 'Director's Cut' of the film and he excised the humanity of the time, the locations, and the people right out of it. Now there is no texture, no atmoshere, no feeling. It is like a Readers Digest version of a very good film. WHAT WAS HE THINKING???
D. H. Lawrence did not bow to public opinion. In his explanation for the cuts, Mr.
Miles said he took out an early scene between Suzman and McKellan because it is hard for an audience to be interested in a man fighting with his wife. Not so. We are shocked by Lawrence's behavior but we stay with it. His is an artistic temperament. And Frieda is no shrinking violet. She is a fighter herself. Sometimes when two people are so evenly matched, there will be fireworks. And the fireworks throughout most of this film have been eliminated. What was a thought provoking screenplay about love and literature and the people who make both has turned into a rather turgid love story.
Among the other items missing was a terrific epilogue that was bittersweet and funny and uplifting. Gone. Mr. Miles has missed all the things that made his original film so memorable. I only have a sad VHS copy and was so very looking forward to a new release of this wonderful film. My disappointment is enormous.
Further, the melodious music which did a beautiful job underscoring the action is now completely overpowering- alienating the audience whereas before it supported the actors.
Anyway, the picture itself is better- but the film is disjointed with the actors going from one crisis to the next with never a chance to see the transitions that got them there.
If you have never seen 'Priest of Love' take a look. If you are among the lucky few that have treasured it- don't bother.",1308873600,31,2026,4.568681318681318
1340211,3,B00004CJRW,"This 1981 production features Ian McKellen in his first leading role in a film.  Fans will not want to miss his bold but detailed characterization of D. H. Lawrence, played here as volatile, quirky, charismatic, and very difficult to live with.  As his wife Freida, Janet Suzman bristles with wit and spit and vinegar, but also the fierce love that makes her performance the heart of the film.  In a low-key supporting role, Penelope Keith turns in perhaps the loveliest performance of the film, as Dorothy Brett, friend of the fiery pair.

There are many other nice turns by actors in smaller roles, but none of them manages to save the film from being less than it might have been, considering the subject matter.  The film never quite comes together to tell its tale well.  However, it's worth watching for any fans of McKellen, Suzman and Keith.

The only real drawback is the tape itself.  I am not familiar with HBO Cannon Videos, but if this is an example of their work, their products should be avoided.  The picture quality is extremely poor: blotchy and muddy and murky, as is the sound.  It is like a tape made from a TV broadcast, or a tape duped from another tape, rather than like a transfer made from the film itself.",1231977600,7,1232,4.584474885844749

Actually I saw the original and can't remember significant scenes which were cut. This DVD is worth it and until recently not available in USA format. Visual excellent, great acting and the story line provides a representative view of the author's life and views on war (thought it was insane losing men to political nonsense), sex (prudish actually....thought masterbation and sex for sex sake a sacrilege to real passion), and the need for monogamy although close relationships with the same sex (not necessarily erotic) very important. The actual scenes show it better.

I recommend Women in Love by Ken Russell and starring Alan Bates as D.H. as a wonderful supplement.

(Amazon incorrectly lists a 115 minute running time when a once 125 minute film now clocks in at a mere 99)

Whenever people have asked me ""Who is / was D H Lawrence?""  I immediately sent them in search of the Original 1981 Release Cut of this film. That film manages to not only uncannily resurrect the historical personages themselves but place them accurately within the context of their time and place.  Not only do you get (more or less), accurately well-told story, you receive a taste and a sense of a specific time, sensibility and place.  This particular quality rarely well-acheived with films generally, is quite rare in films which depict the Life of the Artist. Most films sensationalize ( and discredit) the Creative Life with details of a perceived and indirectly judged Salacious and the Outrageous.  This film managed to provide illuminating vignettes with care, tact, and (mostly) detached 'reportage'.  Central, whether actually taking center stage in the narrative or visual, was the powerful presence of two unusual and unusually civilizing Individuals, their marriage, their reflexive milieu and its personal and public effect.

Without exception, all people I sent to this film  and they were from all walks in life  returned with that look: Spellbound, Fascinated, Intrigued -- even CHANGED.  They were not only taken with the fine acting, the beautiful cinematography and the moving score --- they were intrigued by its over-all 'suggestion' regarding the subject's personal truth. Because not everything in the film was fully spelled out, many of these viewers committed to further research and -- guess what? --- they began or began again TO READ.  What they found was a 'dusty old author' who had something very relevant to express concerning their day-to-day lives.

Uncannily, a film experience did this.  Twenty people I know became avid readers; no lie.
What an impact and legacy from a mere 125 minute film

Unfortunately, I will NOT be the sending the further inquirers to this denatured, dumbed down for 'spoon-feeding the masses' Directors Cut without fair warning.  What was once a sensitively nuanced honorific to be proud of, has become a middle-of-the-road attempt to obviously 'crowd please'.  It lands with a crassly, 'bourgeoisie' thud.

Tedious, confusing, pandering and at times really boring. Stripped of its vitality, we now have a D H and Frieda Lawrence --them eccentrics  (barely) explained to your Uncle Harry and Aunt Jane.  Even with the explanation, what is left will never convince them if they'd even bother to watch it at all.

The intelligently effective music score  truly one of the best of many a film  lent a potent support and a moving, near-elegiac response to whatever was being played-out.  At times, it and we as viewers soared in the celebration of two lives well-lived. The Directors Cut rearranges the musics placement for a series of awkwardly reassigned contextual realignments. It also levels out one of its previous glories: precisely-chosen sonic swellings; an old-fashion cinema touch that was never mawkish and truly worked.

In a word, the music's additionally-informed support has been effectively rendered Movie Muzack.

Though there's no intricacy of foundational spring-board really left anymore, the last 20 minutes of this Director's Cut comes close to restoring the power of the original. But then, for some unknown reason, the wryly ironic and elevating coda of the Forgotten Urn Episode at the very end is removed. The closing shot of the hands placed in solidarity on his urn was such a clever metaphor for the immortal uplift of Lawrence's spirit..  You could see in that moment what Lawrence meant / means to people -- warts and all --Then and Now. That was a near-classic-end-of-a-movie scene -- now it's gone. KAPUT.

The film literally and metaphorically now ends in the grave.

Wheres the mystical halo shot of DH Lawrence at the films beginning?  Where's the Phallic Erection Shadow McKellen refers to in his interview? Why does the intimate scene with Frieda and DH cut-off abruptly? Where's the hugging of the Life-Column? Director Miles, in the included Deleted [Pieces of ] Footage states that people didn't like the halo because it made Lawrence look like a religious figure.  Well, thats how many of Lawrences contemporaries perceived him.  And its an out of the ordinary grace note which draws in our attention.  The ""out of the ordinary"" which interestingly compromises much of the deleted material, was an important -- if not central -- part of Lawrence's work and life.  It was so nice to see the 'rare' and the 'different' validated by inclusion.

The film originally had quite a few of those grace notes.
Now in a purification -- not unlike the burning of Lawrence's books -- theyve been removed.

You have to wonder:  What really gives here with the Director's Cut sanitizing?
Did The Puritans complain? Was Queen Victoria ""not amused""?  Is this a sign of our times??

Even the visual restoration -- although lovely --- is ""off"". Its too hard-edged (too digitalized) and aggressively colored.  I remember sun-suffused desert haze and Mediterranean humidity; everything subtle and delicate with punctuations of strong hue. The visual schema often resembled landscape paintings being created in Europe and southwestern USA at the time.  This painterly quality also aided, along with careful period detail, a near-clairvoyance of being ""there"" while the film unspooled.

Now it's an artificial ""movie-look"" story-telling reality -- beautiful in its own way but looking like most ""everything else"": a professional cinematic product.

I get the feeling Miles listened too much to ignorant-of-the-subject critics and didn't trust his own instincts and commonsense. (For some unknown reason the usually culturally astute NY Times DID pan the original ????) The 1981 Version along with his quietly realized -- and in need of full restoration --THE VIRGIN AND THE GYPSY [1970] are among the best of D H Lawrence-related films. Both films convey quite accurately the Lawrentian mix of the Romantic with the Modernist Psychologically astute. They affirmed my rightness in loving the D H Lawrence Particulars in his body of work. (In hindsight, really too bad this director didn't get to put his hand to THE PLUMED SERPENT as had been planned)

Please, Christopher Miles, bring back your original film. Your PRIEST OF LOVE once had lightness, airiness and Lawrence-like Emotional Intelligence to spare.  It also betrayed an obvious real love for its subject -- its humor and its seriousness -- and a core need to get that out unapologetically on its own terms to constructively enlighten, educate, and entertain.

I'm giving this neutered rearrangement three-stars, instead of two, to draw attention to a superlative original worthy of seeking out.

Old HBO/CANNON VHS tapes can still be found of the original. Muddied in pan-and-scan visuals and erratic in aural quality they are at least ragged testimony to what once was a Gold Standard biographical film.",1494892800,2,7131,5.161739130434783
7920272,4,B00004CJRW,"Sometimes the so-called Directors Cut is not always the best.  Director Christopher Miles has gone back and removed twenty-five minutes from his first 1981 release of the film.  But in doing so he removed some interesting scenes such as one person describing Lawrence as The one who writes the dirty books, which is a perfect summing up of the general publics perception of him and why he got into so much trouble with the authorities. Another was when he was in Mexico and a fortune teller said he had eighteen years left to live  tremendous good news for him as early illnesses in his youth made him realize the closeness of death, and how Frieda was devastated that the prophesy was false and he would die when he had so much work still to do.  Another scene cut was where we see author Katherine Mansfield in a fit of tubercular coughing, foreseeing her own death of the disease that would claim Lawrence, though I didn't know that was who it was.  Director Miles said he made the cuts as they distracted from the main story of Lawrence and Frieda, but they sure take away some of the enjoyment and understanding I got from the original 125 minute version that I saw on cable in the 90s
.
 But all this scene-hacking aside it is still an exquisite picture portraying the last eighteen years of Lawrences efforts to write, live and find peace.  It begins with his arrival in Taos, where he stayed for two years and did his part in the establishment of Santa Fes overblown arts reputation.  He wrote an elaborate essay about the regions spiritual benefits for him, even though a lot of residents like me can just say Meh. The tourist industry has certainly cashed in on his having been here: even if it was only for two years they regard him almost as a native son.  (There didn't seem much to Taos at the time except for a few artist types and the Pueblo.  So the great attraction for the place was that it was isolated from humanity and the Native-American culture was the one showing you where it was at.  Besides, the formidable Mable Dodge Lujan, who single-handedly formed the Taos art colony, made have had a way of making you think you had no other choice in this philistine world but to join her out where she had found The Spot, and where no one else wanted to live.)

 For all his self-describing himself as a priest of love, he and Frieda seemed like two of the most hateful people there ever were.  They seemed to treat everyone they met like dirt. Is this the so-called artistic temperament? I don't know how they managed to make friends.

 The highlight of the film of course is the writing and publishing of  Lady Chatterleys Lover, with Lawrence starting the process with his indispensable pen and little notebook (he hated typewriters), to poring over and discussing things in the larger-sized manuscript (just to show his working methods I suppose, an invaluable lesson for would-be writers), to the setting and rolling of the presses in Italy, and Lawrence giving a proud kiss to the first edition.

  The great Ian McKellen gives a performance in his first starring role that is truly awesome.  I had trouble though with Janet Suzman as Frieda: they had her doing the most abrasive German accent that made her seem like the most spiteful character you ever laid eyes on.  Why didn't they just hire a German actress? I know nothing of the real Frieda Lawrence but Suzman presented her as quite a character.  She and Lawrence both were.  There is also the great Sir John Gielgud as puritanical (oh!) Victorian-minded public censor Herbert G. Musket, Lawrences sworn enemy.

  So, for all its director-imposed hacking, a great picture.  We can just hope that director Miles will one day see the error of his ways and restore the full version at just over two hours.  I think D. H. Lawrence himself would prefer that",1486771200,2,3835,4.606774668630338

H. Lawrence and his circle - as they were. However, it also seems that none of those real life people were particularly likable. One Psychology Today blogger wrote that Lawrence lived to fight, and would sometimes take contradictory positions, depending on which position would get a rise out of the person he was speaking or writing to. I didn't like the characters, but they fascinated me, and so, kept me watching to the end. So if you are fascinated by quirkiness, and sometimes disfunction, you will like it.
