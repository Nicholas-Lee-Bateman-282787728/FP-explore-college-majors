5119300,5,B008220AGC,"Finally a movie that is not ""cookie cut"".  I laughed, I cried, I felt some kinda way.  This movie woke me up and kept me feeling something the entire time.  It was raw but not ridiculous.  I enjoyed it very much and look forward to purchasing a copy for home.",1342137600,7,259,4.12
5119301,3,B008220AGC,"Quvenzhan Wallis makes ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" her film. You follow her right from the very beginning and her narration instantly captures the thought process of the average little boy or girl. ""Average"" isn't the right word for it though. Hushpuppy's life is pretty extraordinary given the circumstances. The way she has to listen to every creature's heartbeat was one of the most interesting aspects of the entire film. Her explanations, quandaries, and conclusions that she makes throughout the film hit you much harder than you expect a six-year-old's demeanor to.

Dwight Henry delivers a great performance, as well. Wink is very selfish, angers easily, and is out of control for most of the picture despite claiming otherwise. He has this tough love thing going on with Hushpuppy and he only wants what's best for his daughter even if his actions in the meantime seem to suggest otherwise. Their chemistry is the foundation of the film.

The score is spectacular, as well. It's so minimal most of the time and is usually just a combination of strings, piano, and a simple drum beat but it throws in banjos, washboards, and whatever else you'd expect from New Orleans type music. It just captured the tone of the film perfectly.

Many of the film's issues seem like they could've been resolved so simply if the characters weren't so stubborn, especially when it comes to whether or not to leave ""The Bathtub"" and Wink's illness. Obviously that more than likely would've altered the message the film was trying to give, but it's incredibly frustrating seeing characters in a film struggle with something when the solution is lingering right under their noses.

The camera work was also distracting more often than not, especially in the first half of the film. Shots are purposely blurry and out of focus for long periods of time and while it was probably done to add some sort of artistic value to the film, that inner voice of yours will be screaming, ""FOCUS!"" after the first few times you experience it.

The message the film gives is an incredible one; facing your fears, overcoming difficult odds, accepting death, something along those lines. The way ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" goes about portraying that message is a bit off-kilter. The Aurochs mostly come off as unnecessary and their final scene is a bit of a letdown. What they represent is one of the driving factors of the film, but they just feel out of place more often than not. Here's a sequence of people struggling to survive a flooded environment where all their sources of food have died out and here's a contrasting shot where giant, mutant boars are running across the countryside and eating each other.

""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" features some exceptional, layered characters the likes of which film rarely sees, strong performances from its lead actors, an impressive score, and has a pretty powerful message. The down side is it's portrayed in this really askew and artistic light that you'll either love or hate. Whether or not you enjoyed ""The Tree of Life,"" will probably be a factor. There are definitely things to enjoy in ""Beasts of the Southern Wild,"" but overall it just comes off as bittersweet. It's as if it's too artistic for it's own good.",1342137600,5,3245,4.8589511754068715
5119302,4,B008220AGC,"Beasts of the Southern Wild is a meditation on outsider status. At least it wants to be that, I think. Both the first-time director (Benh Zeitlin) and the six-year-old star are relative outsiders who will remain outsiders so long as they remain uncommitted to any single cosmic, social, or political vision. This is the unique power and vantage point of the first-time artist: he/she is unaffiliated with any one vision and so open to all. Its a compelling place to be. This film delivers you back to that very primitive and very sophisticated frame of mind, that ground where formative and transformative imagination are as essential to survival as, well, the survival instinct itself.

The director sets this tale of primitive/instinctual survival in (or at least near) New Orleans for its there perhaps more than anywhere else in the US that ""outsider status"" is so integral to a place's creative identity and practices. He also sets the tale there because this city is a place that is currently re-orienting itself in regards to its relation to the mainland/mainstream society that it both courts and rejects (in equal measures). The film itself is a saavy eclectic blending of commercial and underground elements/styles/themes/characters. One of the thrills of viewing this film is that the filmgoer feels like he/she has been given access to a world/reality (or set of worlds/realities) that has heretofore been viewed by mainstream culture as inaccessible. The casting of unknowns was essential. Had the film starred Will and Willow Smith, for instance, it would not truly feel ""independent"" and ""outsider."" But even if the film had starred Will and Willow Smith there is nothing mainstream about this story of an absent mother and sometimes present, sometimes absent father trying to raise a young girl with nothing but his own sometimes inventive, sometimes self-destructive habits of body and mind. The father is no hero (by independent or mainstream standards) and, to his credit, director Zeitlin is not afraid to show the father's many failings but Zeitlin's also imaginative enough not to judge him too harshly and to provide the viewer with a glimpse of what makes such a man tick. This father is no model parent but he has plenty of imagination/spirit and a single-minded desire to live by his own terms and make his own sense of and peace with the universe (he is someone readers of William Faulkner and Toni Morrison novels will recognize). His enemy is anyone who stands in the way of his sense of place and self which are inextricably intertwined, thus some people read a political message in the film, but, to me anyway, its more a cosmic vision than a social or political one--the ""message"", if there is one, is not reducible to a commercial or campaign slogan, its more about man's attempt to belong to a place that often feels inhospitable and overhwelming. At times the father seems to thrive in the heap of chaos that he has built and calls home, at other times he seems to be losing both his battle to remain independent (its a battle every film director knows well) and his battle to tame the chaos within and without. What the father conveys to his daughter is that she must be tough enough to survive but that survival alone is meaningless unless one does so with a certain level of dignity (independence) even though the father does not always display that level of dignity.

The film very much wants to be a statement of artistic independence. It both is and isn't that. The comparisons of this film to Terence Malick's Days of Heaven and Tree of Life make sense because both directors make use of young narrators whose views are largely unfiltered by ideology (or reason for that matter). Malick and Zeitlin's naive narrators still view the world with a sense of awe (which is what these directors are interested in capturing and conveying) but neither Malick nor Zeitlin tell coming-of-age stories in any conventional sense because the enemy of artistic vision/poetry, according to their respective world views, is ""coming of age."" The key to artistic vision/poetry for both directors is retaining contact with those pre-rational processes that inform a much more instinctual connection to the world/universe than the one afforded by ideology/reason/mainstream currents of thought. But this is where both Malick and Zeitlin divide audiences: They both assume that children (and animals) are purer than adults and more in touch with awe and wonder and the sublime (which is most accessible by those least indoctrinated by civilization). This assumption/cliche annoys (some) critics but appeals to mainstream audiences. Its an idea with a long history and its more than a little suspect. The films of both directors work only if you buy this central conceit. If you buy the conceit and the sublime naivete of the narrators rings true for you, the films of Malick and Zeitlin stand as authentic documents by independent, even maverick, directors who stand their own ground no matter what. If you find this central conceit unconvincing, you will not be quite as impressed.

The films of Malick and this first feature by Zeitlin are attempting (with varying degrees of success) to create film poetry (using naive narrators as bridges to and deliverers of awe and wonder and ultimately the sublime) but I also suspect that both Malick and Zeitlin are populists at heart and that they want to create poetry that sells. Each director courts that popular audience in a very distinct way. Malick has the clout to attract stars (Pitt and Penn in the case of Tree of Life) and thus guarantee critical and popular attention even when his material is not commercially viable and divides both critical and popular audiences. Zeitlin, on the other hand, relies on heavy doses of humor delivered by a charismatic child actor as well as a resonant setting (a pertinent and appealing setting in the current popular imagination) to make his film commerically viable. Arguably Malick's film would have been better had it contained a bit more humor (or any sense of humor at all) for humor is what makes Beasts so much more palatable to both the critical and the general public.

To me, Malick and Zeitlin are interesting because their work is compelling even though we suspect its built on untenable ground/assumptions and takes place in a largely imaginary literary space. After all Faulkner and Morrison are still considered great artists even though their own naive narrators sound more like their author than real people.

Compelling cinema!",1341878400,,6558,4.990859232175502
5119303,5,B008220AGC,"A good film is a confluence of many variables. A good director orchestrates these variables into a finished form. Beasts of the Southern Wild is such a film and Behn Zeitlin is such a director. And the brilliance of Zeitlin is that he manages to take all manner of seemingly contradictory elements and make them,as a nameless boat captain says in the film, cohesive.

One such variable is story. Hushpuppy is a six-year-old girl who lives with her father on the wrong side of a levee in a fictitious Southeast Louisiana town called The Bathtub. The film follows her point of view, and the world of her active imagination and the real world around her often intertwine on screen. The film is your standard coming of age story, but it is this unique perspective of Hushpuppy and her understanding of the world around her that is the foundation of the film and its magic.

Another variable is music. The director worked closely with his friend and composer Dan Romer in creating the score for the film. The result is one of the best scores in modern cinema. Just like the film, the music is a beautiful blend of contradictions. It's uplifting yet tinged with sadness, vast yet intimate, wise and noble yet naive and playful.

And the final variable I'll mention is performance. Other reviewers have made mention of the non-actors that occupy this film. This is another example of the director taking the contradictory and making it cohesive. It would seem unlikely that those untrained in the craft of acting would be able to aptly portray such subtlety, humor, love and pathos yet there it is, captured on film for all to see.

Beasts of the Southern Wild is a film that will simultaneously break, mend, and uplift your heart. Do your soul a favor and see this film.",1341705600,196,1764,4.680645161290323
5119304,5,B008220AGC,"A six year old child, beasts, and the portrayal of a Fine Line between Fantasy And Reality! For some reason, certain events reminded me of ""THE SIXTH SENSE"" in the chilling aspect of what was real and what was the Imagination. Regardless, there are no dull moments in this one as chills go up your spine to see what happens next. Acting Performance Excellent And Highly Recommended to all Thriller lovers. Enjoy the Ride!",1341014400,5,421,4.702702702702703
5119305,5,B008220AGC,"It is difficult to find the words to describe the mysterious enchantment of this film.  So much depends on the performance of young Quvenzhane Wallis, a child who is not a trained actress- and yet she more than holds her own compared to seasoned actors. She shines, brightly,  in her role as 6 year old Hushpuppy.

The film focuses on life in ""The Bathtub"" , a poor section of Louisiana. Surviving  there is precarious and everything can be swept away if water overflows the levee system. Hushpuppy has a world view which helps create order amidst chaos but it is about to be severely tested.

The Bathtub community, so vividly seen through Hushpuppy's eyes, is one layer of this film- the words and soundtrack add depth and resonance which result in a film poetic enough to take your breath away. And the images...from Hushpuppy's expressive face to a homemade boat floating on water...they are also hypnotic.

I urge you not to focus only on what is literal or seems true to life in this film. Watching it is often like dreaming while awake. This is not to say that Beasts of the Southern Wild is too artsy. But the plot is portrayed most strongly through the eyes of an imaginative and sensitive 6 year old.

And this is always the part of a film review where I hesitate to provide any information that would spoil the film. So I will only add that there are many intense moments, some  full of  pain and resilience, here. If you see any film on the big screen this year, make it this one. It deserves to be experienced that way.

I do want to add that Hushpuppy's  father, Wink, is also played by a nonprofessional actor ( Dwight Henry) .He is utterly believable in his portrayal of a strong yet flawed man who is deeply loved by his daughter.",1341014400,68,1747,4.496835443037975
5119306,5,B008220AGC,"BOTSW is easily the best movie of 2012 so far (although I loved 'Moonrise Kingdom' too), and the stars should get ready for Oscar season.  The pacing may be off-putting to some, but if you can handle artsy fare, you're sure to love it.  The story tells the tale of eight year old Hushpuppy, who must save her father, friends, and herself from mysterious beasts in what may or may not be the end of the world.  The lines between fantasy and reality are very blurry, which makes this movie a great discussion piece for a group.  One thing I will note is that while everything about this movie is exceptional, the score is one of the best I've heard in a long time.  I went to a screening with the film's director and two stars, and they spoke to how organic the entire film process was, and how elements in the script were rewritten for each of the leads so the dialogue would sound authentic to the deep south.  Every detail is watched carefully, and this is truly a must-see.",1340150400,138,975,4.359116022099448

5119324,5,B008220AGC,"Finally, I was able to see this absolutely stunning film. From start to finish, my eyes, ears and virtually all senses were open and awash in the absolute ""feeling"" of this movie.

I know a lot has been said about the depiction of this little girl, and changing her from boy to girl to boy, the way her father basically refuses to let her be a child, any child, girl or boy; and I get that and see it, glaringly so, but I also realize it's not a great idea to judge the characters. Instead of the awfulness of Hushpuppy's upbringing, which was not a way any child should be raised, you could see the fierce true love that Wink has for Hushpuppy. Is she constant danger? Always. But honestly, though the statistics are different, aren't we all, to some degree? Yes, there is child abuse and again, no child should ever have to live like that. But there are children still begging for food in the streets!!! There are horrible war torn countries were children will never know the meaning of the word ""child"", because tragically, they are forced into adulthood before the age of five. This is our world, and we have to change it; but to say we shouldn't know about or see these conditions, makes an awful lot of ignorant ostriches.

Here, there is such a resonating of a sense of place. These are the people of the land. They are the stewards, they are living off of every part of Nature. This is not only man against Nature, but Man alongside Nature.

The peace before the storm, the feeding of the animals altogether, was just a reminder that there often is careful caring for creatures in the wild. The spirit of ""beast"", is a representation of the independence and individuality of the South that has been disappearing by the encroachment of civilization and proper society for such a long time.

Maybe this movie, at its best is just pure fantasy, and it probably is, but the message, clearly that to hold onto one's own self against all odds, to refuse to be tamed, isn't terrible.

The Herd of Aurochs such a brilliant addition, and that they were roused from sleep and now tramping forward towards Hushpuppy and the flooded marshland, that she would face them, as she's lost her father, as she is alone in the world, sends us all a message, about how we choose to meet our insurmountable obstacles in life; will we cower? Do we bow down? Or do we acknowledge a greater power, do we instead face the fear, and say, yes, but I am here TOO and I ALSO am meant to survive. It's not always about fighting, rather, holding onto one's identity and existing within the danger all around.

To me the movie was largely an Ode to the Good people of the South who have just had to endure SO much loss and suffering since Hurricane Katrina and the results of a catastrophic oil spill, more and more Hurricanes, yesterday Katrina, today it's Harvey; they just keep on.

I just can't fault this movie, certainly not for showing characters with all their flaws and all their heart and brilliance. The Actors and Actresses in this movie, obviously, Ms. Wallis, and Wink, were just so moving, real and fiercely individual. VERY well done! To the finest degree. That's just my humble opinion.",1503705600,,3178,4.535776614310646

It is hard to explain but you go to movies to be entertained and there are lots of movies that do that and do it very well but this movie moved me. This movie is not one thAt you will watch and forget, it will stay with you.  Maybe its because I am from South Louisiana and have seen ans experienced this or because it brings to mind the beauty as well as the challenges of living where the world has forgotten you or you the world. I can't explain my love for my home, South Louisiana or why I love her so but I can tell you this movie certainly captures my whY.  People don't understand why we stay....this so portrays the whY.  WOW beautifully made, beautifully told . Once you watch this movie you will not forget it",1471651200,4,1059,4.3232323232323235

5119433,5,B008220AGC,My husband and I have watched Beasts of the Southern Wild several times.  The first time we both sat on the sofa with our mouths opened almost through the entire film.  We were horrified and mesmerized at the same time.  It is a fascinating story that is both beautifully tender and jarringly harsh.  The father and his daughter are captivating characters.  The soundtrack takes the film to another level.  It was perfect for movie.,1469577600,,432,4.77027027027027
5119434,1,B008220AGC,"As many other reviewers have mentioned here, I had very high hopes for this film based on what I had read about it. But magic and joy?  No--they're not here at all. What is here is an extremely thin plot that can't sustain itself and flat characters that don't bring out a bit of sympathy or caring from me. The father is an abusive idiot, but still flat, flat, flat as a character. About half-way through both my wife and I wanted to turn it off, but I convinced her to finish it out in the hopes that there would be some redemption by the end. None. I don't think she's going to forgive me for a while, though I do have some bonus points stored up for having watched the Twilight movies with her.",1469404800,,698,4.17037037037037

5119457,5,B008220AGC,"I had to watch this moving allegory several times to really understand it. As a parent, it touched me deeply as it explores how a poor, uneducated, dying father with no resources  sets about trying to prepare his little girl to face the dangers of life on her own. It is about self sacrifice, love and the power of community however disheveled and chaotic that community may be. The superb cast of actors, especially Ms. Wallis, lends a feeling of reality to this allegory, which by definition, has elements of fantasy to it.",1468627200,,525,4.645161290322581

5119511,5,B008220AGC,"Having lived in New Orleans and Houston, I am familiar with the hurricanes but have never lived in the swamps shown in this movie.

I noticed that the Amazon Review included the word ""feral"" in the description of the child's life, and I think that ""feral"" captures a lot of the power and the fierceness that is shown in the kind of lives that the people lead.

As others have written, the acting, directing, and visuals are superb.

I do think that some ""poetic license"" has been taken with the depiction of the child's behavior.  For example, I don't believe that a six-year-old would hold up a crab to her ear in order to see if she can hear its heart beating.

Other than a few details in the depiction of the child's behavior, I think that everything ""rang true"" to what I have seen and would guess about the beauty and the terror of living so close to - and in -- nature as these people live.

Like the cavemen to whom the child refers as her ancestors in some ways, these people have a beautiful, timeless, intimate relationship with nature.  Each species must fight to survive and has laws of survival.  These people are ""gatherers"" who live off the fish, shellfish, and alligators of the swamp.  Wink, the child's father, keeps chickens, as well, and perhaps a small vegetable garden.  There is a warm gentleness in their treatment of each other, but their lives are precariously tied to the bayous and the storms.  One can't help feeling that the beauty of their freedom is impoverished by alcoholism and the hazards of poverty.

I cried for the child when she cried.  I work with children and was saddened by her powerful loneliness.",1454803200,,1643,4.566552901023891

The people look natural in many ways, but they also seem like caricatures. Again, confused. Are we going for realism or fantasy? I get that the story is told through the eyes of the child, but it doesn't really hold to that the whole way through. (Ironically, the tugman says he likes feeling cohesive. Meanwhile the story really isn't).

If you want a trip to a foreign culture, this is it. I've been to LA many times, but have never seen anything like this. I appreciate that someone said this is how it is because I would not have believed it otherwise. It seems way over the top. If I were from ""The Bathtub,"" I am not sure whether I'd be insulted or complimented. Still, as a piece of visual art, it's lovely. The ""actors"" did a great job. Maybe I am dense, but I think I would have enjoyed it more if it had been stitched together a little tighter. Great elements. No cohesion.",1435881600,,1041,4.3061224489795915

5119700,4,B008220AGC,"This 2012 film (93 minutes) is an extremely well-acted, fictionalized survival tale of Hurricane Katrina. Set at an indeterminate time in the ""bathtub,"" a fictionalized strip of bayou land on the wrong side of the levees and located right off the Louisiana coast, a six-year old girl and her unstable father refuse to be evacuated when a hurricane hits. Dwight Henry, a New Orleans native who survived Hurricane Katrina, lends authenticity to his role as the dad who refuses to leave the bayou even after the storm. But the young actress who plays the girl is at the heart of the story, as she uses a mix of imagination and high spirits to endure all that follows from the storm's destruction.

Louisiana location footage and realistic acting from non-professionals help bring this adaptation of a stage play to life. The film's real heart is the determination of the little girl, who imagines herself facing down prehistoric boars (the titular beasts) and conversing with her departed mother as the world seems to be ending around her. The film's greatest asset is that it makes us care about the characters and particularly about the tough little girl's struggle to grow up quickly as her father declines and the world around her collapses.

If there is any flaw here, it's that the film suffers from a certain predictability and familiarity. Early foreshadowing scenes make sure there is rarely a point where we can't predict the film's direction: A storm will hit, the father will decline, and the little girl will learn to survive in a world of rural poverty suddenly made even poorer. What makes the film worthwhile, despite its stagey and predictable plot, is the winsome acting that makes the setting come alive. Many of the interactions between father and daughter, and between them and other local survivors, are so delightful to watch that we never feel like we're just waiting for the next scene. It's not the greatest film ever made, but it's the best Katrina-themed survival tale I've seen on film.

5119726,5,B008220AGC,"A masterpiece. It's about the beginning and the end of the world. Magical realism is very sparingly employed, to great effect.

The film depicts a world unto itself, a place so specific, so utterly culturally unique, that it is almost mythical. It's a place surrounded on all sides by water.  It's a sandbar/swamp perched barely above sea level, in waters beyond the bayous of what must be Louisiana.  It might as well be a floating village, a bunch of rafts just lashed together somewhere out in the ocean.

The maybe two or three dozen people who live there call the place that they live ""the Bathtub.""

They are able to swim to the mainland, but it's not easy. Moreover, they would never choose to live there, among people who live on solid land.

The outside world is little more than a myth to these people. (The film might be compared to a great book about a similiarly tiny and isolated village -- ""Suna no Onna,"" or ""The Woman of the Dunes,"" by Kobo Abe.)

The people live symbiotically in a tumbledown village of shacks barely held together by scraps of paper, wood, road signs or posters, or whatever other debris floats their way, all patched together.  They and their village are perpetually on the edge of extinction, not only because of the tiny size of their population and their utter isolation, but because any real rise in the waters could simply erase their community from the map.

They live precariously in abject poverty on the very border of existence and non-existence. But they are not hungry.  And they are very happy, content, tight-knit. They have a little school, where the teacher sometimes shares her beliefs, speaking passionately but informally about the beginning and the end of the world, sharing some of the mythology that is actually tattooed on her body. For the teacher personally, it seems like some kind of mixture of religions, some kind of cajun voodoo. And of course the kids are impressionable. The people live in nothing more than bare subsistence, third world conditions. But again, they are happy.

These people have an intimate relationship with Nature. This is partly because of the watery world they live in, their extreme poverty living in sand and mud, largely open to the elements. It's partly because of their intimate relations with their food sources. They catch or kill with their own hands everything that they eat. It's hand to mouth, daily. It's partly because of their extremely small population, which fosters closeness and interdependence. These people live in close quarters in the sense that the very land under their feet is nothing more than a tiny sandbar surrounded by sea, sky, mist.

In this mix is a very little (tiny) girl who has tremendous dignity, beyond her years. Though not visibly apparent, we gradually find that she seems to have an inarticulate -- or unarticulated  -- but almost superhuman comprehension of the world she lives in, an almost magical grasp of the nature of, and the frailty and durability of, life and death.  Interestingly, the viewer of the film does not even know whether these qualities are necessarily unique to her, or qualities common to her people. She's the protagonist, so we see everything through her eyes.

The little girl sees past, present, future, dreamtime all intermingled, co-existing.  The film has absolute temporality and specificity of time and place -- but it is a place so specific, so unique that you cannot know whether such a place actually exists.

We only ever know the little girl as ""Hushpuppy."" That's what she's called, and for all we know, that's her actual name.

A flood comes. Given the precarious and only semi-terrestrial existence of the village, the flood is of truly biblical proportions.  It is devastating, leaving carcasses floating in the water and washed up in the mud. Meanwhile, Hushpuppy's father (her only parent) is dying of some kind of illness.

The father is nothing but gruff with the little girl throughout the film, but it turns out that this demeanor is misleading.

The truth is that he basically sees and therefore treats his tiny daughter -- who is little more than a baby -- as an equal, as if he knows the strength or magic she has. And we don't know how much of that strength or magic is a result, actually, of her upbringing by this man.

The father's treatment of the girl seems for a good part of the beginning of this film to be abject, what you'd call criminal, neglect. He disappears for days without even telling the girl that he's leaving. She wanders for days in the mud, in her underwear. Then he shows up again. He apparently assumes that while he's gone, she'll wander to someone else's shack and they will take care of her, or that she'll get hungry and simply kill a chicken or something. He doesn't disappear because he's drunk or anything. He has his reasons for disappearing. Still, he doesn't so much as mention to this little girl that he's leaving or where he's going or where he's been.

Ultimately, the little girl, Hushpuppy, sees the apocalypse -- directly, with her own eyes -- but simply rejects it, out of strength, principle, loyalty, and a sense of belonging. It's as if the world actually ends, but she simply wills it back into existence.

Her father dies. She wraps and ties his body up in a blanket, sets him in a boat, sets the boat ablaze, and pushes it out to sea. Life goes on, because she tells it to. She's barely more than a baby, with a profound sense of heritage and belonging.

The film, made in 2012, is the story of a kind of bayou disaster with intonations of disastrous climate change as seen through the eyes, imagination and fears of a young child, named Hushpuppy, played with exceptional evocation by Olivenzhan Wallis.

Hushpuppys six-year-old world view is colored through her innocent perspective and imagination, but it is nonetheless real, as are her fears, which she comes to confront as the events that sweep her up lead her to realize her own inner strength and independence.

The screenplay, by Lucy Alibar and director Benh Zeitlin, was adapted from Alibars stage play, and is as imaginative as are Hushpuppys memories of her mother, relayed to her by the stories of her father, struggling along with her to survive the harsh trials of disaster and poverty.

The spirit which lives through to the end of this story, along with Walliss performance, made it a favorite at the Sundance Film Festival and make it well worth the time to immerse oneself into its undeniable magic.",1425427200,,1144,4.942708333333333

This movie is a mess.  What's even worse is that this hot mess got multiple awards for WHAT-THE-HECK-EVER......I guess all the mad vegetarian hipsters on bicycles came out to vote for it.

The camera work was awful - frequently looked about as focused as iPhone p*rn - and the directing was willfully absent most of the time, and downright stoned the rest.

5119849,4,B008220AGC,"BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD is one of those Oscar-winning movies that I missed out on seeing the first time around, and I really didn't have much of a motivation to actually watch it since the Academy Awards aren't terribly important to me. Still, I am glad that I finally decided to break down and watch it because there were aspects of it that really spoke to me on an emotional level.

 It stars Quvenzhane Wallis as Hushpuppy, a young girl who lives with her father in a Louisiana bayou community called the Bathtub. There isn't a concrete story, per se, instead following Hushpuppy around as she learns how the world works and is gradually exposed to what a harsh place it can be. One central theme is the fragility of human communities, and how one thing going wrong can lead to loss of balance and equilibrium. A prime real-world example of this, and one that I think the film took inspiration from, is Hurricane Katrina. This is never addressed in the film, either directly or indirectly, but the specter of that natural disaster hangs over it like a cloud. There is also fragility in the sense that the levee is the only thing that keeps the Bathtub functioning and thriving, and its destruction radically changes life for its residents.

 Another theme, which was more applicable to me than the proudly defiant and resilient Bayou community, was that of bravery and courage in the face of death. Having recently (yesterday), just gone through the loss of my grandfather, the way in which Hushpuppy has do deal with the impending loss of her father hit very close to home. And connecting to the previous theme, her father is a vital part of her world and losing him is something she has to come to terms with, even for being so young and impressionable. This brings me to my general impression of the film, and that is a child's view of the world, innocent and optimistic. We often try to shield our young from the trials and travails that life sometimes has in store, but inevitably they will experience these things and we need to prepare them for when that time comes.

 As far as quality goes, I could take or leave the handheld shooting style but I will at least admit that it works in a naturalistic sort of way and meshes well with the naturalistic performances given by the cast. The performances themselves were decent, and Quvenzhane Wallis was particularly good, although I would probably chalk this up more to the director than Wallis herself. I also appreciated the on-location shooting which shows off the natural beauty of the Lousiana bayou. What didn't quite work for me, and maybe it's because I didn't quite ""get"" it, was the aurochs. The metaphorical use of these extinct creatures came off as a little too pretentious for me and the film probably would have been just as effective without them. Perhaps they were supposed to represent the ""beasts"" in the title but there were already enough real animals in the film to illustrate Hushpuppy's connection with them, and of course the ""human animal.""

 Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I actually enjoyed this film. It started off a little bit on shaky ground, but as the film progressed it grew on me and I was completely on-board with it by the end. It might be too artsy for some due to its meandering story structure and ponderous voiceover, but it does a good job of probing the psyche of a child and examining how we as humans fit into the natural world. If Terrence Malick is too difficult to get into for you but you still like a thought-provoking, imaginative film, then this will probably do just fine.",1421193600,,3604,4.646781789638933

Hushpuppy's mom is gone, so she imagines that a sports jersey is her mother and talks to her.  Her teacher tells her about the beasts called Aurochs who went extinct when the Ice Age ended, but they used to eat children (she says) and Hushpuppy is afraid that if everything is not right in the world the icecaps will melt and the frozen Aurochs will come back to kill them. They are happy in The Bathtub and they do not want to leave, but a hurricane causes a massive flood and the government tries to rip them away to a sterile shelter...their solution was to burst the levee and the waters went down but the government officials don't care. Aurochs begin to ravage the land again.  Hushpuppy and her friends try to stay but when her dad is taken away, she finds him ""plugged into the wall"" and although we are never told what disease he has, it is fatal and he wants to die at his home.

5120055,5,B008220AGC,"This movie is animated by genius the likes of which I have never witnessed before. The music, the camera, and above all the people vibrate in a way that caresses some deep part of the human soul. It is a grand work of art but more than that it is a raw tribute to authentic decency. It looks like a documentary because everything in it is unprocessed and real. It feels like life because it is life, because it honors life, because it is meticulously and lovingly respectful of life, of people, of animals and of the totality of life that is the natural world.
This is the display of sight and sound, at the highest level. It is often said that films dishonor books that conceived them. But  in this instance, no book could ever do this movie justice because this movie is a new sort of art that very few films ever achieve. It is a pure film that uses light, sound, editing, acting, direction and camera work de-novo. There is simply no way to write it down because it is essentially and entirely cinematic.
To put it another way, I am unable to explain the plot in words. Whatever I might try say by way of narrative will certainly miss the point and to me, the point is the experience of the film itself. It REALLY is an experience and it is so well done that it brought me to tears and leaves me in awe. Give it your full attention and you WILL be affected.",1409270400,2,1361,4.254826254826255

The young child actress carried the film with her compelling personality but her diction was weak.

5120161,2,B008220AGC,"This film has several things to commend it, starting with the acting, which is outstanding. Also, the idea of a place like the Bathtub, a vibrant community where everyone seems happy despite almost surreal poverty, is compelling. I could not help liking Hushpuppy, who is introduced to us as a child who is always picking up animals and listening to their heartbeat or ""code;"" this is amusing when she does it to a crab. I also liked the idea of leaving pictures for the ""scientists of the future,"" who would know ""there was a Hushpuppy who lived with her father in the Bathtub."" The aurochs was a nice touch, although they were hardly the meanest and most dangerous animals of their time (or whatever the lady with the tattoo called them); they were a large type of cattle. The saber-tooth tiger or the cave bear would have made more sense, although the scene with Hushpuppy facing what looked like a gigantic hog with bull's horns was powerful enough. The problem is the atrocious camerawork (I've seen home movies that were steadier) and the director's failure to capture the beauty of the place. This film would have been vastly improved if it looked like ""Scent of Green Papaya."" Some reviewers said it moved too slowly, but this is the fault of the meandering, directionless script. What the film really needed was to move even more slowly, to linger over this strange environment and show us its details. In the hands of another director, it could have been great. As it is, it has nothing to recommend it other than the exotic locale, the exceptional acting, and the independent, ""artsy,"" non-Hollywood presentation that will automatically endear it to many people. And before anyone gets offended, I mean someone such as myself that wanted to like the film as soon as I heard about it.

One cannot help but wonder if the lead actress' unique name (she pronounces it ""Kwa-VEN-ja-nay"") contributed to her being selected for the role. ""Quvenzhane Wallis"" definitely adds a level of interest that ""Betty Smith"" doesn't have. Her sister's name, Qunyquekya, is even better.

Everything I heard about this film pointed to the little girl leaving to search for her mother. I kept waiting for this to happen and it never did, unless the ""search"" consisted of her having an imaginary conversation with her mother as if she was in the room, and her periodically going outside and screaming.",1402876800,,2411,4.790865384615385

--- excellent character development

5120256,4,B008220AGC,"Little Hushpuppy and her papa, Wink, live in a place called The Bathtub, a fictional marshy island that is fast becoming one of the early casualties of a rapidly warming planet. It is a world of great poverty, but also one where the people live in harmony with the environment and each other. They are generally a happy people, quick to party and to find joy in life and in each other's company, but there's a dark side too, for the residents appear to be living on borrowed time, as the sea gradually rises, threatening to submerge their land and destroy their homes.

Hushpuppy, however, has more immediate problems of her own to deal with, including a father whose mercurial temperament may mask a more serious health issue, and a mother who left years ago and whom Hushpuppy expects to return any day now. Hushpuppy believes that she has a gift for communicating with animals, which is a very important power to have in a place where beasts are celebrated and cherished for the sustenance they provide the community. Though still a little girl, Hushpuppy already has a guiding philosophy for her life: ""The entire universe depends on everything fitting together just rightif you can fix the broken piece, everything can go right back."" And indeed, throughout the course of the story, she spends a lot of time trying to fix broken pieces. And while sometimes broken things just remain broken, Hushpuppy also learns that true power can only come when one recognizes that all elements of nature are inextricably linked to one another in some vast cosmic web, each part having its own unique role to play. It's an insight that indigenous peoples, i.e., those who live closest to the land, have always seemed to have had a better grasp of than those who boast of a more ""civilized"" style of life.

The village faces an existential challenge, a possible prelude to what lies ahead, when a huge storm floods the island, making it virtually impossible for the community to continue sustaining itself there. But they are determined to try, despite the well-meaning government officials who have orders to evacuate them to a shelter back on the mainland.

The movie has a gauzy, hallucinatory quality to it at times, as Hushpuppy has dreams and visions of both her absent mother and some exaggeratedly large marauding beasts that may or may not hold the key to her understanding of the universe.

Based on a one-act play by Lucy Alibar, adapted by both her and director Ben Zeitlan, ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" serves as the vehicle for Quvenzhane Walllis , whose work here earned her the distinction of being the youngest person ever to be nominated for a Best Actress Oscar. Wallis is transcendent as she embodies all the wide-eyed innocence and shrewd comprehension of a young girl intensely in touch with the world around her. A nonprofessional, Dwight Henry is also excellent as her irascible but loving father who's trying his best to raise a child despite all the physical and emotional struggles he himself is going through.

Replete with a soaring score by Zeitlan and Dan Romer, ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" offers a lyrical and life-affirming glimpse into a fascinating, exotic world.",1396310400,2,3192,4.84954128440367

But having just awoken from a nasty nightmare, clearly the result of this film, I'm pissed. Mainly because this film was represented as a magical, mystical story of the little girl, so I waited, and waited, and waited.  But what I got was a eye/mind/heart full of severe human depravity and disfunction, and a bloody nightmare chaser.

5120259,5,B008220AGC,"""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" opens with a landscape of hardscrabble poverty that could be many places: I was totally unfamiliar with the plot, and thought perhaps it was set in Africa). Gradually the story is developed, centered on the lives of six-year old Hushpuppy, the introspective and often isolated daughter of Wink. They live on what most would consider the wrong side of a Louisiana levee, in an isolated community known as ""The Bathtub"".

Wink and Hushpuppy are both struggling with abandonment (Hushpuppy's mom left the family under circumstances never fully explained), and Wink also suffers from other maladies. His drinking (and that of many of The Bathtub's adults that are his peers) is evident from the beginning. It's also clear that he has other medical issues. Eventually, after a hurricane has come and gone and profoundly disrupted The Bathtub's residents way of life, Wink has to tell Hushpuppy about the leukemia that is killing him.

Throughout this movie, Hushpuppy is influenced by other adults, some that come and go and some that stay: the Bathtub's regulars, the women who populate a floating catfish restaurant and nightclub, the folk healer who teaches her and her and other Bathtub kids some of the hard truths about the world (""we are all meat...""). She is also aligned with the natural world around her, the rhythms of rural livestock, and their eventual role in placing food on the table.

The beasts of the title are aurochs, symbolic of fear and loss that appear in Hushpuppy's visions of the world. And make no mistake about it: it is a world that is wet and dirty, with adults streaked with violence, devoid of true warmth or connection (""I can count the number of times I've been picked up"" she says at one point).

For a PG-13 movie, the subject matter is serious and intense; tread carefully before exposing younger viewers to this movie.

But by all means, watch it. It's far afield from the usual offerings on the big screen, and will take you to surprising places at the end.",1396137600,3,2022,4.832369942196531

Watching the adults celebrate the incoming storm (by everyone shouting ""Yeah!!!"" for absolutely no reason while spraying dangerous fireworks all over the tinderbox woods), it's hard to see why the kids should not be taken away to shelters away from these brain cell free morons in their ""community"".

The community that Hushpuppy lives in does not produce anything, does not build anything, does not repair anything, does not maintain anything. They seem completely isolated from the outside world, yet somehow have an economy that supplies them with fireworks shipped from distant China, and bottled label beer from outside their community. There is a small plot of Hushpuppy's Dad having some sort of plague, or is it the symptoms of his 24/7 alcohol diet? From the adults in the movie, this story goes a long way towards showing what happens when people become so dependent on a benevolent government that they are unable to think for themselves when a hurricane is looming. That's the only factual connection with Hurricane Katrina, where mayor Ray Nagin and Lousiana governor Kathleen Blanco were criminally incompetent and clueless and failed to evacuate people or follow their own state guidelines and procedures.

Back to the movie, we are shown giant boars unleashed for the next Ice Age by a vengeful nature. At first I thought only Hushpuppy saw them, a symptom of her father feeding her wood alcohol I presume. But all the kids scream and the adults run when the boars show up to acknowledge Hushpuppy as their Queen of the new age. The boars disappear as the surviving community marches to the civilized land, waving flags and apparently giving up to return to the land of Wal-mart. If all the drunken idiots in this movie drowned while drinking their 5th bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey, I doubt they'd notice. Good riddance and I hope there's not a sequel for this exceedingly mindless Hunger Games Lite.",1391472000,,2226,4.981182795698925

This is a film about garbage pile-up, wherein an off-the-scale group of drunks destroy themselves and any animal warmth that exists in their human countenance. If an empty tin can becomes a child's mirror, then what you get is a permanent bulldog mask. Little Hushpuppy, a desperate six year old's cavernous hunger and rage are projected into nearly psychotic fantasies of cannibalizing wild pigs. ""I'm meat. You're meat. We're all just meat,"" says (or something close) Hushpuppy's spiritual teacher, a crazy lady living in what the film calls ""the bathtub,"" which would be better named ""the hell heap.""  Her  knowledge thirsty student kids get rammed with the most hideous baseline of object lessons. Eat or be eaten. You're nothing but a bite on someone else's food chain. We watch Hushpuppy bullied and abandoned as she sinks further and further into a helpless stupor of fear and horrid hyper vigilance. Little Hushpuppy already has nothing to lose. She NEVER smiles. Any wrinkle of feeling in her has long ago died, leaving her eyes as lifeless as the world she inhabits. It's a cruel cruel world without even a slip of redemption. And whatever Hushpuppy does, this preschooler may never ever cry about it. Ever. When two tears are let loose, her wooden face absorbs them.

There is an authenticity about Beasts, reinforced by a cast made up of ordinary, townspeople (including the local baker as Hushpuppy's father) - no household names here - that lends the film gravitas, and makes it into the particularly powerful and haunting social statement that it is.

Finally, the sense of community and commitment to looking after one another among the abject poor is affectingly portrayed and, indeed, as recent academic studies have reported, mirrors reality.

The result is an astonishing and slightly mind blowing independent film of the highest quality.
The story tells about a band of ragtag yet proud residents of the Louisiana coastal region living in ramshackle living quarters outside of the levee despite government warnings and subsisted on meager daily needs.
Among the group there was a 6 year old girl nicknamed 'Hushpuppy""  living with his ailing and half crazed father.
Her mother was long gone/disappeared and it was the girl's quest to seek out her wayward mother.
The film's original source material was a stage play.
The result is a magical, lyrical, poetic and amazing film.  The Oscar nominated(Best Actress) Quvenzhane Wallis who played the girl is superb, as well as his father played by a local shopkeeper.
The script, the direction, the production design, the music and the acting (by mostly non-professionals) are of the highest order.

5120518,5,B008220AGC,"Beasts of the Southern Wild didn't strike me as a movie I would enjoy watching or even purchase - however, after some very insistent prodding from my better half, I rented this movie from Amazon video and then promptly purchased it after finishing.

Why did I purchase it?  Well, this movie is told from the mind of a small female child, whose life is modeled after that of a person living in the southern bayou of Louisiana (I do not believe the state is every directly mentioned, but it paints a vivid and candid picture).  This child and her father live in an old mobile home like structure and survive off the land and the good graces of their neighbors and friends.  Each person in their community looks out for the others.  While this sounds lovely - there is some heavy drinking going on and some less than stellar parenting (no judgement, just what the movie attempts to portray).

Throughout the movie the viewers are treated with glimpses of some larger than life wild beast rampaging towards the little piece of bayou that this young girl calls home.  These beasts seem to be the young girls method of coping with the realities that are her life - poverty, a less than attentive father, and her premature need to grow up to fend for herself.

Overall, all these facets of the movie lend to a very entertaining and worthy performance.  Unlike some other recent ""glimpses into the mind of children"" films, this film captures your emotions, depicts the wonder that is a child's mind, and shows a part of American life that not so many of her citizens are truly aware of.

5120521,4,B008220AGC,"It was Quvenzhane Wallis' Academy Award nomination that drew me to ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"", as well as the stunning soundtrack that played over the trailer, two reasons which are as good as any to sit down and watch a film. The best part was that I had absolutely no idea what to expect, since the promotional material portrayed the film as being anything from a serious family drama to a post-modern fairytale. As it turns out, it's a bit of both.

The story is set in Southeast Louisiana, specifically a small settlement known as the Bathtub. Far from the usual romanticized portrayal of the Old South, this is a region where the swamps are filled with death and decay, where hurricanes and floods are devastating, where outsiders are well-meaning but unwelcome, and where the Gulf Sea is slowly but surely encroaching upon the land. The Bathtub is separated from ""the dry world"" by a levee, and its residents live in poverty - some might even say squalor. It's unclear whether any of these people actually work, they just live, and as is established early on in the film, the place enjoys ""more holidays than the whole rest of the world"".

Most of their food seems to come straight from the sea or swamp, there's always plenty of alcohol on hand, and during their night time revelries adults fire guns into the air while children run around with lit fireworks in their bare hands.

If this sounds like it's hedged with negative connotations, it shouldn't be, because all of the above is portrayed in a hugely positive light.  This is the truth about how these people live, and as the movie progresses it becomes clear that the Bathtub's residents are all exactly where they want to be, and nothing is going to keep them from their homes and lives for very long.

This is where six year old Hushpuppy (Quvenzhane Wallis) lives with her father Wink (Dwight Henry), her mother having walked out on them. Well, not lives ""with"" him exactly, as she has her own ramshackle house of her own, joined to her father's only by a bell rope. Most of the time she's left to her own devices, wandering around the area in her gumboots and underwear, talking to her mother's clothing, sharing her food with the dog, and using a flamethrower to light the gas cooker. It takes a while to get a proper fix on the father/daughter relationship, and for the first twenty minutes or so I had Wink pegged as a deadbeat abuser. He gives his daughter a slap early on and then disappears for a period of time, only to turn up again in a hospital gown with no other explanation as to where he's been.

But the relationship deepens, and it's soon apparent that Wink is not only unwell, but deeply concerned with the need to make his daughter self-sufficient. In this he's a hard taskmaster, teaching her to kill a fish by hitting it on the head, verbally goading her into various challenges, and insisting that she never cry. He's clearly trying to prep her for his imminent death, even as he attempts to withhold the truth about the seriousness of his condition from her, and it results in this tiny six year old being forced into some very intense situations.

(But also some very funny ones. At times Wink seems to forget that he has a daughter, and has her yelling ""I'm the man!"" and declaring her the king - not queen - of the Bathtub. Plus Quvenzhane Wallis has this little high-pitched squeal that's just adorable, particularly since it's meant to be her equivalent of a war-cry).

As a consequence of her father's illness and the impending storm that floods the Bathtub with salt water, Hushpuppy's life is filled with fear and anxiety. Her voiceovers demonstrate that she's acutely aware of her own mortality and of time passing, of unstoppable natural forces and the grim realities of death, and she's determined to leave evidence of her existence so that future scientists might know of her. She's full of the little quirks and idiosyncrasies that make up childhood - like the way she puts almost everything to her ear as though it's a seashell, whether it be baby birds or dead crabs or fallen leaves, in the hopes of hearing what any of it has got to say.

Her teacher tells her of creatures known as the aurochs: giant prehistoric boars that are released from their icy prison thanks to the melting polar icecaps, and which gradually make their way across land and sea to Hushpuppy's door - though whether these creatures are real or just an elaborate fantasy derived from the mind of a traumatized girl is a matter of debate. What really matters is that the story is very much told from her perspective, not only in regards to the voiceover narration, but in the filming techniques that convey a child's point-of-view. Most of the time the camera angles are low, and the conversations of the adults are nearly impossible to discern due to the muted sound (surely you remember when you were a kid and the discussions of the adults around you were little more than gibberish - that's the atmosphere that's captured here).

It results in a particularly vivid rendering of Hushpuppy's perception of the world, keeping her the focus of the film no matter what unexpected directions it takes. About halfway through the action moves to the mainland once officials have rounded up the Bathtub residents and placed them in a shelter, a place that Hushpuppy describes as ""a fish tank with no water"". In the third act, the film suddenly veers into magic realism, in which Hushpuppy and her cohorts swim out to sea to find her mother, get picked up by a vessel whose captain tells them it'll take them where they need to go, and are dropped off at a brothel where Hushpuppy meets a woman that is assumed to be her missing mother.

But the most remarkable thing about the film is the performances, particularly since neither Quvenzhane Wallis nor Dwight Henry had any prior acting experience. I believe this was also a first time effort from director Behn Zeitlin, and perhaps it's the raw and unpolished simplicity that all three bring to the project that give it its unique flavour, topped off by the truly extraordinary score. I find it impossible to describe music, being entirely without any musical talent myself; suffice to say that this is one of those soundtracks that carries such resonance you feel as though you've been hearing it throughout your entire life.

Many films try to portray poverty as an ugly thing, or as a worthy thing by projecting it through a lens of false sentimentality. ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" depicts death and destruction and squalor as beautiful by being as truthful about it as possible: showing that though it may be tough and uncompromising, it's all part of the way these people chose to live. One striking scene in which this attitude shines is when the children arrive at the brothel. Your heart initially sinks, assuming that they're in a terrible place where their innocence is about to be ripped away from them by what they find there. But instead there is a soft, dreamy scene in which the prostitutes and the girls slow dance together, very gently and lovingly, each child as safe as they would be with their own mothers.

So there is kindness and wisdom amidst the destruction and sordidness, and though Hushpuppy suffers great loss, by the end of the film she has become like a little Moses figure, leading her people - children and adults alike - back to the swamplands of the Bathtub, even as the watermark spills up and over the road they walk on.

The cover shot was the only joyful scene in the movie and there is nothing magical in it other than a child imagining prehistoric animals coming back to life. (Magic is when something like that actually happens and not just imagined.)  The movie was a look at the harsh realities of life in that area of New Orleans and ends on a downer.

5120636,1,B008220AGC,"Beasts Of The Southern Wild or Beasts as I will refer to it, is one of the WORST films ever made, certainly the worst movie that I have ever seen personally. I didn't really know quite what to expect from Beasts, other than it was supposedly fanciful and whimsical, at least that's what Oprah said about it. Oprah Winfrey profiled this film, the director, as well as the actors on her new talk show; on her new network. Since I like Oprah, I thought Beasts would be worth my time. Let me say that this film is so awful and amateurish, so ugly and disgusting, that I will NEVER watch another film that is recommended by Ms. Winfrey again; not without checking with other reviewers first. This film is so terrible that it makes me wonder how or why so many people could give it good reviews, and this is a well reviewed movie! The film depicts poverty and squalor, alcoholism and child abuse in a way that seems to condone these awful conditions. The acting is unprofessional, and never convincing. At no time did I believe in or care about the characters. At no point in the movie could I even buy the premise that this was anything more than a effort to manipulate the audience with a cute little 5 year old in something that was, at best, a home movie. I was scratching my head the entire time wondering to myself, HOW DID THIS CINEMATIC CATACLYSM EVER GET MADE? Did Oprah finance this train-wreck? Is that why she recommended it? I'm being totally serious here, words alone cannot convey just how awful, terrible, ghastly and horrendously loathsome Beasts Of The Southern Wild really is.

5120638,3,B008220AGC,"This film is well made: the visuals are awesome, the soundtrack good, the props perfect, the acting stellar, the pace pitch perfect, it kept my interest, and the overall vision of the filmmaking process is sound.  And yet, I don't like this film.  I don't believe the lives depicted.  I think the characters come right out of someone's imagination and that those characters are alien to the people who live in any kind of place or way in reality, which is depicted as ""the bathtub"" in this film.  If you haven't seen it yet, don't read past here.  Spoiler Alert!!!!!!!!!  I'm about to critique serious plot pieces to this film.

The squalor and lack of pride of place that is depicted strikes me as how an outsider would see a world ""off the grid"" and in poverty, such as the Bathtub.  For example the film has a scene where food is just poured on the floor for children to eat who are under a table.  Being from the South I have seen a lot of ""casual"" dining.  Not everyone turns to Martha Stewart for tips.  If there is a pit or grill folks get it going without a lot of fuss, but no paper laid on the floor first, not even a paper bag?  This is my point.  The film shows us foreigners to our cultivated society in America, foreigners who are unquestionably American.  But how it depicts these foreign folks turns them into ""beasts of the southern wild,"" and in the process minimizes their humanity, which absolutely exists even in ""off the grid"" communities that are different from the mainstream.

Of course those folks would lay paper down for their children to eat off of, especially after a disaster like Katrina.  But what if there was no paper around?  Then the eating place for those children would have been prepared as best they could.  Even if these folks are ""beasts"" like the beautiful beasts of this world, beasts still have pride of place.  You may see a cat nest and think it is squalor, but believe it, those cats do not think so.  They have prepared, with care I would stress, that place.  And a film about ""beasts"" that really gets them, unless the film is purposely showing a breakdown in the inner workings of these ""beasts,"" has to show that care, that pride of place, even as it simultaneously shows us pride of place which is different from our accepted version.  But this film doesn't.  It keeps a foreigner's eye.  It depicts the Bathtub inhabitants ""lacking"" pride of place in order to show ""difference"" in pride of place.  This is repeated throughout the film in shocking ways.

And a scene where the Bathtub inhabitants blow up the levee is simply gross.  Why is that in this film?  It would HAVE to be seven years (by DVD release date) since Katrina for a film to take a bold, hurtful, and fanciful step like suggesting that poor people, the same ones by demographic that the systems and norms of our country left to die (it's true), are actually the ones that caused those levees to break in the first place.  This is irresponsible to the point of being monstrous.  The work that this depiction does is to lay most of Katrina's damage at the feet of the population most killed by Katrina.  This is the exact opposite of real life.  The breaking of those levees caused, some say, the majority of the filth and disease and damage from Katrina.  And there was bureaucratic and political breakdown that caused the levees to be as unstable and inadequate as they were.  And that Bureaucratic and political breakdown was as far removed from the populations that the Bathtub depicts as you can get because those populations didn't have any power, bureaucratic or political.

So when this film depicts that event, and then LAYS IT at the feet of the very population the Bathtub residents would be a part of in real life, I wonder why and how the filmmakers could or would do that.

The filmmakers seem to be telling a myth about the human experience.  But the issues I have described cause that myth to get bogged down in the mud of our very real American culture with its blindnesses and fear of telling the truth.  This film has many merits, but it is also painful in many ways.",1374796800,2,4105,4.519674355495251

I just wanted to watch it because it was an Oscar nominee at the time and I wanted to see it before the awards ceremony.

The story is intense.  The star of the movie is most definitely Quvenzhane Wallis.  What a talent this young lady exhibits.

This film is gritty and emotional and surprising.  It makes you wonder just what the hell's going on, but it also speaks to the human condition that is present in all of us...the fight for survival.  There is family, fellowship, love, loss, and fear.  And to quote a certain book's passage...the greatest of these is love.",1374624000,3,741,4.462686567164179

It is about a backwater, neglected bayou community that sits just beyond the protective levee. Many of he actors are not professional, but actual members of ""Bathtub"", which enhances the reality of the film immensely. The primary theme is about the evil corporate world vs. poor, indigenous people who live simply and are attached to their land and their culture. The other focus of the film is the heroic 6 year old daughter, her relationship with her mentally unstable father and the challenges she faces growing up. Her acting is outstanding, a powerful and endearing performance.

The movie is nuanced, complex and moving. There is much to enjoy and much to think about after it's over.",1374624000,,825,4.9352517985611515

I wish they would have focused on the big picture a bit more, and maybe shortened the film slightly.",1372204800,,416,4.2784810126582276
5120694,2,B008220AGC,"First I say its misleading because this is what is  on the back of the DVD:

""Teeming with magic, beauty and pure joy, this crowd-pleasing winner at the Sundance Film Festival has emerged as one of the year's most acclaimed films. Newcomer Quvenzhan, Wallis delivers an ""Oscarr-worthy performance"" (Philadelphia Daily News) as Hushpuppy, the six-year-old force of nature in an isolated bayou community. When her tough but loving father Wink (Dwight Henry) succumbs to a mysterious malady, the fierce and determined girl bravely sets out on a journey to the outside world. But Hushpuppy's quest is hindered by a ""busted"" universe that melts the ice caps and unleashes an army of prehistoric beasts.""

That description, coupled with the picture of the girl on the front makes you think its a interesting movie about a child for children that adults would enjoy. At least that was the impression that I got with terms like :

""Teeming with magic, beauty and pure joy, this crowd-pleasing""

""...tough but loving father Wink...succumbs to a mysterious malady, the fierce and determined girl bravely sets out on a journey to the outside world.""

""But Hushpuppy's quest is hindered by a ""busted"" universe that melts the ice caps and unleashes an army of prehistoric beasts.""

The truth is that this movie is about a little girl who lives in poverty  in a community that is populated with drunks who have given up on everything but staying put in their  shanty town. Her mother is a prostitute that abandoned her. Her father is a drunk, possibly mentally slow individual who suffers from seizures and seems to be dying of blood poisoning.

Periodically you see these huge boars with tusks that are traveling towards the shanty town. She confronts the boars with a couple of sentences and they leave . It does not seem like she saves her father ( at least it seems like she does not, but to be honest, now I cannot even remember) and her mother does not come to stay with her either, she is left homeless.

Yeah so I am assuming that the ""magic"" is the boars? The beauty? I must have missed that when I sneezed. I do not know where the joy of life comes in to play because the entire movie is what Child Protection Agency nightmare.  I will say this though, believable acting.

But I was severely disappointed with this movie, mostly because the description alluded to something much different.",1371686400,6,2385,4.773722627737226

5120713,5,B008220AGC,"I hate to be a part of the over-hype squad, so I tried to wait for my enthusiasm to simmer-down, but no luck. I can't stop myself from saying this was hands-down the film of the year, for me, and possibly the greatest movie I have ever seen. I'm sorry if that makes you defensive or overly hopeful for something else, but this movie truly fired on all pistons.

It is wonderful to go into a movie so blind to what I can expect. All I had heard was that there was a very young girl at the eye of a tornado of hype. I was neither prepared to love nor hate her. Neither the director nor the cast seemed to have any reputation at all beyond the center star and the controversy about her award nominations.

So, we got this DVD in the mail from Netflix, and I was excited to see what all the chatter was about. We pressed play, and went on a wild ride. In the opening scenes I was still getting my bearing on the look of the Super-8 film, and what kind of genre I was experiencing. It looks like vintage Disney nature show footage, and initially you may be expecting a slower pace more typical of these up-close gritty films like Take Shelter. In many ways this was similar to that film with emotional highs and lows, except Beasts has a clearer fantasy element to it's plot, and the central character propels the film with her hopefulness like the tiniest Skywalker in the dingiest spaces imaginable.

But, as I eased into the first hour, I felt increasingly drawn in and mesmerized by the story and the performances that propelled it, until I could hardly blink for fear of missing something.

This movie is far from the slow crawl of most low-budget quirky indie films, as evidenced by the small group of critics calling it irresponsibly violent, etc. That perspective was more valid for the movie Drive (also a film I really liked), but while Drive collected together all the greatest scene elements from multiple classic suspense, gangster, and horror films, Beasts seems to rather break away completely and establish a new sub-genre, that pays homage to no other specific film.

As far as the violence, critics are obviously referring to the abusive father, who slaps her, punches a catfish, etc. Although I had a fantastic father, two people very close to me had abusive fathers, that would leave to get wasted and show back up whenever they wanted with their hearts full of a passion for God-knows-what and a fleeting concern for everyone else, placing ridiculous people and priorities above the welfare of their family. His very real portrayal combined with the Super-8 camera look gave the film a slight documentary/reality-show/biopic quality.

The presence of the giant pigs pushes the film into fantasy territory with a mostly subtle use of special effects. Some of the images of the pigs traveling were not as natural as I wanted, but when they arrived then they didn't seem quite so mechanized. That is truly the only negative I have to say about it.

The plot had that George Lucas type effect of creating such an elaborate sense of purpose and symbolism to this alternate world, built out of very humanistic elements, feelings and ideas. It's easy to forget that sort of Ray Bradbury style sci-fi that is less focused on futurism, and more focused on turning a mirror to humanity with a ""what if"" scenario used to amplify and exaggerate reality until we can see it with new eyes.

That being said, and despite all those great parts, this entire film is largely carried on the back of one amazingly hypnotic six year old girl. From the second she enters the frame, my eyes followed her like a cat to a laser pointer. The director was so good at getting out of her way, and keeping the camera angles shifting at a natural pace. With a script this poetic, a six year old actress this captivating, and a wildly belligerent supporting actor, it's hard to give the director the credit he deserves for stringing it all together, but he deserves all the future offers I anticipate he will receive, as will the rest of the prominent people involved, I hope.

This is a masterclass in film making, script writing, acting, and plot design. I hesitate to say this, but right now I feel this may be the greatest movie of all time. It's poetry is pure and hope-filled, it's talent comes out of nowhere, and it's story design is so rich. For my tastes, this is as close to perfection as I could ever hope for.",1370908800,,4406,4.567088607594937

It is the quality of life and the friends you keep that make the Bayou way of life desirable for those whom live it.

Everything you need to tell your children about life is in the script and it lends just the right amount of fear to drive the point home. Hushpuppy sets an excellent example of a child who learns empirically instead of asking 10,000 questions. She is eloquent and poised, stoic and brave.

But Moondonkey!  Ohhhhh... it is so unique.  Ohhhhh... it is so raw.  Ohhhh.... It is so meaningful.  Blah.  Blah.  Blah.  Get your pinky out of the air while sipping your tea.

I have a theory on this. Well, perhaps not so much of a theory as a statement of fact.  My theories tend to be universal truths.  Anyway - my theory is that self-righteous snobs love to praise things that suck because it makes them feel elitist.  They find it ""profound"" or some such nonsense and the rest of the uneducated masses just don't understand it.  Sort of like reading Faulkner or something.  Have you ever read Faulkner?  Don't.  It sucks.

Since I was bored, I looked at the most popular 5 star reviews of this freak show and took a quote from each.  Below, I present the quote and its translation:

""Beautiful elegy"" = suck
""...a confluence of many variables"" = suck
""... a powerful performance"" = suck
""Powerful, moving film..."" = suck
""surreal..."" = suck
""Poetic, raw, magical"" = suck
""unconventional and extraordinary film"" = suck
""an astounding, original , brilliant and visionary film..."" = suck

Poetical, raw, and magical?  Really?  Poetic... raw... and magical?  This film is about a bunch or run down morons living in shacks.  There is nothing poetic about it.  The girl's dad treats her like garbage and makes her live in a separate shack until she burns it down. What is so ""moving"" or ""visionary"" about a group of transients living in a floodplain who are too ignorant/stupid/lazy/mentally ill (you choose which) to make any attempt at living a normal life.  Being worthless doesn't make you special... it just makes you worthless.  You can quote me on that.  I think it would look good printed on a tshirt.

*FYI - I used the word ""normal"" intentionally because I know it will get the self-righteous anti-capitalist buffoons reading this something to get irritated about.  The argument is ""Well what's normal? Is our greedy capitalistic society normal?  Maybe it is our greed and misguided values that caused this situation in the first place.  We are the one's who are screwed up... not the people living in the bathtub...they suffer because of our greed...""

While the community members struggle to survive the hurricane and other impending calamities, Hushpuppy sets out to find her long-lost mother on her own.

The actual film is more mystifying (or confusing) than the synopsis suggests, often blurring reality and fantasy. ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" has some beautiful and evocative images (its opening and ending especially) while its shaky digital camera often annoys us. The film also has a message about the way we live, most obviously seen in the crab-eating scene. The message, fine as it is, is weakened by some of the community member's behaviors (child neglect is just one of them).

Usually, these conflicting characteristics help enrich the film's content and make its storytelling subtle and nuanced, but this does not happen in ""Beasts of the Southern Wild."" Here, you either like the film and see the merits only, or hate it for its flaws.

The story is mythic and alien to a lot of us, and hard to get a reading on if you're looking for motivation or reason; but that's what makes this film such an achievement in both storytelling and cinema. It's hard to look away from the life these people live and harder to explain why things are like that for them. It's dificult to stop trying to layer one's own social sensibilities on top of this skeleton of startling poverty and squalor. At times, it's like looking at a documentary about a third-world country in chaos. The viewer must constantly remind himself of the fact that this is America, and that everything you think you know about our life in this country is just not pertinent to some groups of people in some places. But if you drop your moral outrage for a moment and just allow the story to unfold, and give the characters space to be themselves, you realize that there are some universal truths being told here: that hope isn't something that comes from the new and the shiny, that heroism isn't always something elevated beyond our basic instinct for survival, and that even a nightmare is still just a dream.

5120831,5,B008220AGC,"Beasts of the Southern Wild has taken top prizes at Sundance and Cannes and has now racked up nominations at the Oscars. The talk of the town is Quvenzhan Wallis. A six year old at the time of filming, and now eight, the young actress plays Hushpuppy, a girl who lives with her father, Wink, in a Louisiana bayou town. The town is dubbed The Bathtub and is a fictionalized, self-enclosed village, separated from the modern world by a levee. In their solipsistic existence, the residents of The Bathtub live life fishing, drinking, and having a good time, living in houses constructed from debris and waste, perfectly content to live day-to-day without the complexities (or ugliness?) of contemporary society.

Hushpuppy wants to be a man. Or at least wants to be her father; or at least that's what her father wants. This is to prepare her for the uncertain future ahead of her as Wink is slowly wasting away from a health condition. Hushpuppy screams ferociously to assert herself, tries to belch like a grown man who's had too much beer, and is not afraid to punch Wink.

The Bathtub's children all go to a small school taught by Miss Bathsheba, who tells them about the village's folk religion about the Aurochs--these large prehistoric, tusked hogs that are preserved in the arctic ice--and how they may be released due to the melting ice caps. As the film progresses, the Aurochs break free of their cold bondage and rush toward The Bathtub as a hurricane begins to form. The hurricane's course trajectory includes The Bathtub, but the residents refuse to evacuate.

I will leave the rest of the story for you to find out for yourself on your home televisions. Beasts of the Southern Wild is one of those films you can't get out of your head because of its sheer ingenuity and novelty. In many ways, it's sui generis in the world it creates in Louisiana. With magical realism that will remind viewers of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's novels, Hushpuppy has what A. O. Scott has called ""juvenile narcissism"" at the New York Times. It is through this lens of juvenile narcissism that the whole movie is cast. The Auorchs, the magical world of The Bathtub, the desire to be a grown man that can take on the world--these are building blocks of a Hushpuppy-centric world. Beyond this, there isn't much of an anchor to the story other than her relationship with Wink, her father. The rest of the narrative swirls around them almost spasmodically in a most charming fashion.

Reviews of Beasts of the Southern Wild have been divided, with most praising it, while a significant minority have found it uninteresting both in its storyline and its character development. I am personally torn about how to react to the film, and would say that it's a film of art that is to be savored and appreciated, more than to be enjoyed. I would not watch it again for its entertainment value. I think audiences are more engrossed by the world of The Bathtub as strange and curious, rather than attached to the characters or intrigued by the plotline.

As with many films, we can read into the symbols the director has provided us with. Is the hurricane and the melting ice caps a platform for an environmentalist message? Are the Aurochs a personification of Hushpuppy's coming-of-age as a frightening prospect? How much of the film is a commentary on Hurricane Katrina and the government's response (there is a mandatory evacuation imposed on The Bathtub by a government agency)? All these are discussion points raised by Beasts of the Southern Wild, but I personally found the tension between youth and maturity, embodied in Hushpuppy, to be the most compelling theme.

Hushpuppy is a young girl that's expected to act as a grown up, but what her father teaches her about being mature fall along the lines of being bold and acting like a man (burping, drinking, feeding yourself). These ideals derive from Wink's overarching goal of making Hushpuppy fit for survival after his imminent death. I'm not making a judgment call as to the morality of the film, but merely pointing out the reason for the fascination with Hushpuppy and how it drives the movie. Within our psyches, there's an attraction to coming-of-age stories, where children confront the ""real world"" and become adults as they adapt to it. Hushpuppy, on the other hand, appears to conquer her fears, not by casting away the magic of her youth, but persisting in her faith in The Bathtub world and its surrealism.

So what exactly are the beasts of the southern wild? I haven't actually read anywhere anyone addressing this question. I'm inclined to say that the beasts are the residents of The Bathtub, but the word ""beasts"" here is not derogatory. Rather, in a Rousseauan turn of phrase, they are the independent, noble savages, who are left untarnished. As a soon-to-be-independent resident of The Bathtub, Hushpuppy is not required to throw off the magical realism of her younger years, but can remain in it as something noble.

Beasts of the Southern Wild is already on DVD and you can watch it on Amazon, rent it from Netflix, or get it from whatever source of cinematic goodness you so desire. I recommend watching it, not for entertainment, but for the art of being transported to another kind of universe.

The unstated statements about community, education, pollution are uncompromising as the love father and daughter have for one another.

5120987,3,B008220AGC,"To say this a strange movie, would be the understatement of the year (century?).  It is a fantasy yet it deals with abject poverty, an irresponsible, abusive (but loving) dying father, a mother who presumably has abandoned her family, global warming, unfeeling bureaucracies and big corporations, animal abuse (at least to a fish), a whorehouse filled, of course, with prostitutes with hearts of gold, the wise `witch doctor,' the requisite gaggle of wonderful `quirky' uneducated alcoholic neighbors (where racism appears to be completely eliminated in this utopian communal setting (in the Mississippi Delta!),  and finally the prehistoric beasts of the film's title  - hardly a candidate to be a double feature with Disney's Peter Pan or The Lion King.

Clearly the movie has the wonderful work of the two principal actors, the little girl, Hushpuppy, played by Quvenzhan Wallis (justifiably nominated for a best actress Academy Award) and the father, played by Dwight Henry, both who never acted before.

Yet ultimately I spent a lot of time wondering how Hushpuppy's white boots in the next scene were always pristine white after wandering around in mud over her the top of her boots, why (caution: spoiler alert!) no one seemed to be concerned when she burns her home/shack to the ground, why there is a bus conveniently parked and ready to go when the residents escape from the detention center, and finally what the hell do those title beasts represent?

I gave it 3 stars because it certainly provides the viewer with lots of food for discussion, and how many movies can you say that about?",1365724800,,1599,5.0150943396226415

5121066,2,B008220AGC,It is movies like this that I fear are viewed worldwide and establish the image of America with the viewer.  A very sad tale.,1365033600,,125,4.208333333333333
5121067,2,B008220AGC,"This is the fantasy story of an impoverished African American girl (HushPuppy, played by Quvenzhan&eacute; Wallis) living in a Louisiana bayou community with an abusive, alcoholic father (Dwight Henry).  Their community gets hit by a hurricane, and, as a result of global warming, ice chunks containing frozen beasts (aurochs) from the ancient past float toward the Louisiana coast, where they thaw and release the now live animals. The movie follows the girl's life as the fabric of her community unravels, and as she ultimately faces the beasts.

This movie has great cinematography, and both Wallis and Henry do an excellent job portraying their characters. But I found that the film fell short of the critical acclaim that has greeted its release.  The main problem for me, a person who grew up in the South near a very poor community, is that the movie was written by white middle-class people, and it shows.  There are many fanciful notions about how the poor live. The animals are better fed and cared for than the children. The squalor the film's characters inhabit is depicted as more of a Rousseauesque state of innocence than the public health hazard it truly is.  Images of caked dirt and mud are supposed to show us that these people are ""close to the earth;"" however, most of us who've spent much time in homes like the ones in this film would certainly not romanticize the experience.  There is also racial stereotyping, as the ""words of wisdom"" that come out of this precocious girl's mouth are variants of the sort of folk wisdom uttered in general by people of color in films done by college educated whites.

Also problematic is that the adults in this community are alcoholics and completely unable to properly care for their kids or anything else.  The movie portrays this ""happy-go-lucky"" community as being colorful, indeed whimsical -- but it is not.  Communities like this in real life can be terribly hard on their young, and they don't generally produce wise, saintly, healthy and good-looking children like the main character in this film. Furthermore, the filmmakers heavy-handedly portray the middle class ""squares"" who come to take the residents to a post-storm shelter as evil ""mainstreamers"" who don't respect the poor folks' superior, more natural, mode of life.  This is plain silliness.

Finally, the ending does not ring true.  Hush Puppy and her father share a moment that drips with sentimentality, such that all the preceding abuse now becomes thickly crusted with treacle. Thus the authors completely sidestep the ambiguities of the pair's troubled relationship in their quest for a climactic tear-jerk moment.

Beasts of the Southern Wild exemplifies the cloying side of postmodernist filmmaking.  The emotional excesses that Norman Rockwell used to champion the plain vanilla goodness of the bourgeois classes are here employed to promote the moral authenticity of the poor. But whereas Rockwell grew up in the class whose virtues he extolled, this movie's makers seem to have had little experience of the milieu which they portray.  Thus they give us a culture that has been bent by artsy caprice into an exotic experience that the viewer can enjoy safely, voyeur-like, from his living room armchair.

In this way it is exploitative, using the poor as entertainment props in a film for viewers who will never have to live in an unplumbed shack or eat chicken boiled in water over a wood stove.  And in the service of political correctness, it fails to criticize the flaws in the culture it explores.  Instead, by minimizing the effect of the community's problems on its children, the film applies a feel-good patina over dirt, disorder, ignorance, drunkenness, neglect, and abuse. This allows the viewer to observe how the other half lives and feel no sense of social responsibility.  And finally, in true post-modernist fashion, the film skims over the surface of many issues (global warming, social inequity, the plight of the poor, the relationship between civilization and wilderness, etc.)rather than exploring any in depth, thus ending up a hipster collage of fashionable ideas.  The fact that the film has been so popular, especially with critics, speaks to a lack of ethical awareness of how cultural groups are exploited for the entertainment industry, even by the most well-meaning artists.",1365033600,3,4344,5.074438202247191

I did however find parts of the film quite offensive -- such as the ""wisdom"" imparted by the adults in this unusual community, that one of the worst and most reprehensible things one can be, is akin to a slang word for female genitals.  THis conveys a very ugly misogyny apparently built into a central place in the culture, that I don't believe helps anyone to be part of this movie.  Surely a marginalized folk community could be better portrayed without this.  The other offensive element of the film was the violent, hostile and abusive character of the protagonist's father. One got the sense he could not say anything without screaming or yelling it.  Nearly every motion he made was made with hostility.  He was portrayed as having a soft side as well, but I don't see the value of making him such a hostile character -- I think that doing so exacerbates racist perspectives.",1364515200,5,1056,4.620320855614973

5121159,4,B008220AGC,"Beasts of the Southern Wild, nominated for nearly every film award possible, is a bit of magical realism from the place where magical realism literally grows on trees: the bayous of Louisiana. It's the story of 6 year old Hushpuppy, who lives with her dying father Wink on a barrier island in a place called The Bathtub. When a storm (Katrina?) comes, because the polar ice caps are melting, the village is inundated and nearly destroyed. Along the way, Hushpuppy's vivid dream life resurrects her dead mother (who may or may not really be dead, but might just be working in a brothel), helps her father escape from a makeshift shelter/hospital that's caring for (or maybe killing) storm survivors, rescues her friends from giant wild boars, and learns to fight, eat a crab, and confront life-changing loss. Sometimes the magical realism is a bit overwrought and the messaging (climate change, class warfare) a bit strident, but this dream-walk through a child's-eye view of tragedy and love is worth the rent. See it twice though: unless you speak fluent Cajun, you might miss some dialogue the first time around.",1364342400,,1114,4.930851063829787

5121182,5,B008220AGC,"NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW.

CAVEAT: this is NOT a film appropriate for a child to view.  It has a short scene of child abuse,some scenes where a drunk person is out of control, and some dream sequences that would be very scary for a child.

I can't tell you if this film is realistic in its portrayal of a ""backwoods"" (for lack of a better word) community of people in southern Louisiana, but I was captivated from beginnning to end.  From the very beginning I was fascinated by the main character - a little girl living in poverty and without electricity with her father.  It was so skillfully filmed that at times I felt I was seeing the world through her eyes.  How in the world anyone was able to coach a child so young to give such an incredible performance I cannot understand.

It's not a cheerful movie, but it is so fascinating and beautifully filmed that I didn't feel depressed afterward by the sad parts of the story line.  I have tremendous admiration for everyone involved in this film - whoever came up with the story, whoever wrote the script (there are plenty of moments without dialogue, where you just see and hear things in nature, and thus feel like you are THERE), the actors (especially the little girl), and the visual/camera and auditory work that went into it.",1364169600,,1287,4.517241379310345
5121183,5,B008220AGC,This movie was breath taking. I got it. It showed a group of people in the crunch of life. They are making the best of what they have. They are poor people not sad people. Making the best of the only life they known. Q was born to act.,1364169600,,235,3.816326530612245

5121216,5,B008220AGC,I liked this movie although at times it was hard to watch. The scenery is both breathtaking and harsh as it chronicals the story of a five year old and her father. Not for the faint of heart as people do live the way it is depicted.,1364169600,,232,3.9574468085106385

5121221,5,B008220AGC,This movie was great. It was done in good taste. This movie portrayed the very many conditions of humans behavior under the stresses of life and choices made or thrust upon you.

There are some scenes that some might find unpleasant but they are important for her character development and growth.  This is not for the uninititated.

5121354,4,B008220AGC,"Initially this movie was a bit confusing because there was no obvious plot. However, as the film progressed the plot emerged. Seen through the eyes of a six year old girl named Hushpuppy, the viewer enters her environment that is primitive and hidden from mainstream society. She and her father Wink live in a coastal area known as the Bathtub. They play a waiting game with nature; the inevitability of flooding is always with them. They and their neighbors live in severe poverty, but communally they are tied to the only home they have ever known and shun the ugliness of society and progress. A monumental storm with the ferocity of Katrina hits and they see their home destroyed as well as the homes of their neighbors. Compounding an already dire situation, Wink is sick and plagued with seizures. Hushpuppy's mother is not with the family, but is present to her daughter as a distant light. Hushpuppy manages to survive a multitude of adversities as the movie plays with themes such as a vanishing way of life, resilience, and determination.
The way this film is photographed shifts between an almost bitter reality and a dreamlike state. Nature is portrayed at its cruelest but is also seen as beautiful and wild. The film also portrays the mistrust the residents of the wild have for traditional society which they see as the interloper taking away their way of life and their existence.
Hushpuppy drives the film as everything is perceived from her point of view. She deals with the inevitable death of her father with a child's stoicism while she yearns for the mother she has never known.
Quvenzhan&eacute; Wallis portrays Hushpuppy and delivers an astonishishing performance that is deep and heartbreaking. I had a hard time stiffling the tears as I watched her. She was so cute and endearing and totally believable. Frankly, she left the rest of the cast in the dust with her Hushpuppy.
What else can I say. This was a beautiful movie but also more than a little depressing. It made me sad to think of hiw many people live like this and are marginalized by society.",1363392000,,2079,4.777777777777778

I thought it was a movie about lions, tigers, elephants in Africa. I thught the little girl wandering there was a crazy way to introduce a jungle movie. I hung in to see where it was going and was she going to wrestle a lion.  OK I admit, I am the stupidest person on the planet, and slo at checking out after paying for a movie.  I finally realized this is not what I thought it was. The southern wild was the Gulf, the beasts were the people living there who chose to remain wild and not be conformists. My most learning moment was when the ""welfare"" people caught the little girl, cleaned her up and put her in a beautiful blue dress. She did not belong there (in a beautiful dress), She belonged in her t-shirt, shorts, and white fisherman's boots. We are not all the same, we do not all belong in the same way of life.

5121444,4,B008220AGC,"This is a compelling movie, wonderfully cast and fairly well written. All in all, it is mesmerizing. The movie depicts a world, maybe in the present and maybe in the future, where people survive on their own resourcefulness alone, yet exist with at least some degree of joy and hope. It takes the viewer's mind to the limits of the question we ask in this age of natural disasters and societal crisis: ""What if I lose everything?""

The best thing about the movie was the performance of Quvenzhane Wallis, who was remarkable as a 5-year-old acting as realistically and poignantly as a brilliant adult actor. The novice actor playing her father was equally as effective in a role as a man with no assets other than his pure force of will.

I believe the little girl should have won the academy award for Best Actress.

I also loved the movie's point of view from the perspective of the little girl, and the literal way she internalized messages from adults who tried to prepare her for her world.

But the plot can be hard to follow at certain points, when visual images alone are supposed to portray key plot points. And the special effects (the ""beasts"" as seen in the child's imagination) were sometimes silly and unrealistic....which could break the suspension of disbelief needed to remain transported by the premise of the movie.",1363219200,,1333,4.732758620689655

However, this film was sloppily disjointed and condescending towards the bayou peoples, depicting them as excessively uneducated and possibly mentally impaired.  The blood disease that the father in this movie had was not believable at all.  Most things in the movie did not make sense, and the film reeks of inauthenticity.  The little girl in the movie was adorable and was one of the more redeeming qualities of an overall sloppily crafted movie.

5121446,2,B008220AGC,"It wasn't horrible, but it definitely didn't live up to the hype. It is definitely a misrepresentation of some of the people it claims to depict. I guess I could see its appeal to those far removed from the location and culture, to which the scenery, situation and the people alone would be novel. People like to be able to say that they sympathize or can relate to people that they are far removed from and have no understanding of, and I suppose this movie provides an easy, zero-personal investment way to do that for those who won't pick up on the inaccuracies, which for me, made it difficult to look past to stay with the story line, at least until well into the movie.

The characters in this movie almost seemed more of a caricature, and less a characterization, especially in the earlier scenes. From the community, to the culture and relating of the people to one another. And, although they hired actresses/actors from the region, some of the accents were pretty ""off"". Granted, accents vary greatly across parts of Louisiana (although to folks outside of the region, I understand they may all sound the same), but many of the ones in this movie were not consistent with those of the folks I have known that are actually from the pier house and houseboat communities of the area during my time growing up/playing/working in the region. If they were accurate, 90% of you would have had to watch it with subtitles on.

In closing, don't get your undies in a bunch, this is just one man's opinion, and a warning before watching to those who are familiar with the culture depicted. If you found it incredibly profound, more power to you. I wasted my money; you didn't.",1363132800,,1675,4.617449664429531

5121503,4,B008220AGC,"An independent film that burst on the scene, Beasts of the Southern Wild is a harrowing depiction of life in an impoverished, deep southern community.  It focuses on how an isolated town responds to a disaster and, in particular, one little girl who sees the world through a prism.  A little gem of a film, it boasts superior performances by an amateur cast.

In the Bayou country (and narrated from her point of view), a rebellious, young girl named Hushpuppy (Quvenzhan Wallis), has a very personalized vision of life in her world where there is a natural order of humans and wild, prehistoric beasts who rule the land.  Abandoned by her mother, her angry and sometime abusive father, Wink (Dwight Henry), is the only family who is there to care for her.  When not drinking to excess, he encourages her to hone her survival skills in the wild.  The two share an extremely poor existence living in rundown shacks and sharing camaraderie with other locals.  As a prophesied, destructive flood uproots everyone's lives, she must learn to survive and grow up fast.  When personal tragedy strikes, she must come to terms with her family and her place in the world.

Shooting on location in the rural south has a colorful flavor and adds to the film's realism.  Using amateurs in the key roles makes the film authentic, and Wallis is the revelation here.  In a role that would be challenging for a teenager, she shines, and never once do you think that this is a performance by an actor.  Henry interacts wonderfully with her as the troubled father, and his was perhaps an overlooked, award worthy role.

It shows how a way of life can be changed forever when disaster strikes and how people respond to the major changes in their lives.  The tight knit community has character and a closeness that transcends natural disasters and personal loss.  They come together to help one another.  Although Wink is stern and an alcoholic, he still teaches Hushpuppy the lessons in life and the art of survival in the wild.  His rage and health problems are belied by the love for his daughter.  Perhaps that's the only way he can show her his love until the bittersweet end.

There is a surreal sequence where Hushpuppy and her friends make a trek to a distant bar where they meet a gregarious collection of seafarers, barflies and hookers.  It is there she is befriended by a woman who cooks her a meal.  Could this be her mother?  The final scene between Hushpuppy and Wink is a touching moment of truth that distills all that has transpired before and reinforces their relationship. Despite all the hardships and conflict, there is ultimately the love of a father and daughter.

With mythical and allegorical overtones, this is a spiritual film that must be experienced to appreciate its unique take on a slice of the world as seen through the eyes of a girl whose fascination with how the universe works and her desire to leave her mark on the world is only exceeded by her love for her father and `family'.",1362873600,2,2997,4.677480916030534
5121504,3,B008220AGC,"Why you shouldn't see it:

If you have a hard time relating to poor people or people who can't speak English, you might struggle with Beasts of the Southern Wild. I'm not talking about ""poor people"" as in they can only afford a feature phone instead of a smart phone, and I don't mean ""poor people"" as in they are forced to shop almost exclusively at Wal-mart. I'm talking about poor people in the sense that they haven't even heard of feature phones or Wal-mart. And I'm not talking about people who can't speak English because they were taught some other language as tykes; I'm talking about people who can't speak English because they are physically incapable of getting words of English out through their horribly creole lips.

The setting of this film is in a place called The Bathtub, which is a fictional... ""neighborhood""? just outside the levees that protect New Orleans from flooding. These people live in a surreal sort of world where they seem to not only survive but thrive on their natural surroundings and the trash of civilization. Their lifestyle is actually fairly reminiscent of many takes on post-apocalyptic storylines. So really, anyone reading this review should have access to a computer and, therefore, be light years ahead of the good people of this movie and be largely unable to relate. Or so I assume.

I've stated before that I'm pretty good at watching movie trailers, and I'll still stand by that claim. But every once in a while, my skills will fail me, and various other factors will lead to my expectations of a movie being fairly different from the movie itself. This is one of those occasions. Specifically, the trailer and synopsis for Beasts lead one to believe that it is a much more fantastical film than it ends up being. With the exception of one part of the story, nearly every bit of it ends up being pretty firmly grounded in (a somewhat harsh) reality. It didn't help my opinion of the movie much that I thought the acting of 9-year-old Quvenzhane Wallis didn't strike me as any better than ""decent"" for a girl of her age, despite all of the rave reviews I had heard to the contrary.

Why you should see it:

While I don't anticipate any one of you being able to empathize all that strongly with the living squalor in which the protagonist of this film finds herself, I do imagine some of you can relate to her loss of a parent. Though I hope for your sake that you can't relate to her losing a parent and then having to deal with the other parent becoming seriously ill.

The metaphorical nature of the storytelling upon which Beasts is built is fairly evocative, with the world of a little girl literally coming apart while she has to deal with her father's illness. I can only imagine what it would be like to go through such a situation, but I don't believe it would be much different from how it is portrayed in the movie. In figurative terms, at least. I rather doubt that if I had, at any point, lost my parents, it would have been in the shambles that these people consider their homes.

In Short:

Beasts of the Southern Wild is as straightforward a coming of age tale as you can get while still involving the backward people of the Louisiana Bayou and mythological prehistoric beasts. The metaphor is effective, if not terribly complex, and it results in a quaint tale of a little girl's struggle with her particular lot in life. I rated it a 7 out of 10 for its successes despite its relative simplicity, and will recommend it as worth watching once, though I don't expect it to leave any powerfully lasting impressions.

Exceptions to the recommendation:
- if thick accents lead would lead you to turning on subtitles if only you didn't hate reading your movies;
- if you suffer from hydrophobia;
- if you suffer from cryptozoophobia;
- if you suffer from parthenophobia;
- or, more simply, if you prefer your women (particularly your pre-pubescent women) to be of the more passive variety;
- people who struggle enough with the parents who haven't left them.",1362873600,,4018,4.6241234221598875

My take on it was somewhat different. I really loved the film, because to me it was about how scary it is to grow up. I thought it was beautiful and touching the way it shows how humans deal with hardship and tragedy by creating mythologies around issues we are unable to face without the edifice of a larger world beyond ourselves. The fact that it was through a child's eyes was disarming, especially, since as adults we have information the child does not, knowledge of the hardships of that region, the politics, and the impossible life she has ahead of her.

5121546,4,B008220AGC,"For all the hype that Moby Dick gets, let's face facts.  It's a book where the story takes a huge back seat to colorful descriptions of what life's like for whalers, and of the mysteries of their prey.  While this must have been fascinating in 1851, to anyone who grew up watching Nature or the Discovery Channel, it's all kind of dull.  Whales aren't a mystery, because we've grown up knowing all about them.

I was reminded of this while watching Beasts of the Southern Wild.  As a movie, it's kind of so-so.  The little girl is awesome, I'll give you that.  But I cared less for the story than I did for the compelling look the film gave me into a world I didn't even know existed.  It's the modern day equivalent of the fascination that 1850's me would have felt reading Melville's endless pages about whale taxonomy.

It is a unique tale of love and perseverance in times of trouble.  Some have criticized the film for its mythologizing of New Orleans after the levees broke.  Others have objected to the depictions of Hush Puppy's unsupervised life and to the Beast life of the Bathtub where she lives.  I find these criticisms to be part of the film's appeal.  I rely on art to provoke me to look closely at things and people I have disregarded, taken for granted, or never known.  This film has helped me to think about my place in the balance of things, the times I have broken faith, and the ways one can (or cannot) make amends for one's critical missteps.  Quvenzhane Wallis as Hush Puppy is a wonder as is Dwight Henry who plays her father.  The narration is poetic and compelling.  The characters are beautifully-complex.

Moving on.  This movie is wonderful and funny and heartwarming and heartbreaking all rolled in to one.  The acting is FABULOUS!  There is a reason this little girl was nominated for Best Actress.  And the most amazing part is none of them are established actors.  The dad runs a bakery in real life and the little girl was too young to audition and lied about her age.  But their characters are so real and so believable that you want nothing more to cheer for Hushpuppy who lives in the Bathtub.

5121607,5,B008220AGC,"With Beasts of the Southern Wild, Benh Zeitlen shows you a world you've never seen. But he doesn't show you the mechanics and the politics of it. He show's you it's HEART. He shows you it's spirit. The audience is drawn right into a beautiful, fragile world in the deep American South, as seen through the innocent eyes of the young girl Hushpuppy.

Quevenzhane Wallis - a brilliant 9 year old actress, was nominated for an Oscar for her perfect, incredible role as Hushpuppy - a young girl ""who lives with her Daddy in the Bathtub."" Critic Roger Ebert described her as ""a nine-year old force of nature."" And he's completely right. Quvenzhane's incredible performance as Hushpuppy - an equally incredible character- is worthy of any and all praise you can give it! It's acting that equals the best that I've seen an adult do.

And let's not forget Dwight Henry as Wink. Now this is a man that has no previous acting experience - a family man who owns a bakery, who plays a difficult, meaty, scene-stealing, complex role as Hushpuppy's wild father Wink. His is a character that at is at one moment violent and alcoholic, and at the next a strong and fiercely loyal father. In my opinion, he IS one of the beasts of the Southern wild. The film is populated with brilliant, incredible characters such as these.

I would also like to mention the amazing cinematography, score, and CGI. The Aurochs look perfectly realistic, and, while they're obviously CGI, don't detract from the film one iota, one atom! The cinematography is beautiful!
Colourful, real, magical, beautiful, haunting, stirring, incredibly vivid...all these and more describe the cinematography of Beasts of the Southern Wild.
And the score was one of my favourite parts of the film. It complements the film perfectly: enunciating but not detracting from the more emotional scenes, and used to great, heart-rousing effect in the closing scenes. It's really worth a listen.!

The combination of all these amazing elements is a movie that is sometimes hard to watch, sometimes sad, but always magical, always original, always brilliant and beautiful. I didn't really like the story all that much - it's pretty straightforward and it could be better, but man does this movie pack a wallop!

There is so so much more to cinema then Hollywood. Beasts of the Southern Wild is the future - an independent film with an unknown star that dazzled audiences worldwide, and transported them to another world of beauty, fragility, and magic.

Lots of people find this film hard to understand. I like that in a film. But honestly, I'm not inclined to try to understand it. I have the same joyous feeling of reverent incomprehension that I get when I gape at a Byzantine icon or a terra cotta warrior from ancient China. I know it's superb. I know it meant something profound to its creator. Knowing that is enough to make it compelling for me.

I suppose I could extract an explicit No-Man-is-an-Island philosophy from the little girl Hushpuppy's voice-over monologues. If I did that, however, I'd have to confront the incredibility of such thoughts emerging from the mind of a six-year-old. John Donne and Baruch Spinoza had to work harder to achieve such resolution.

The movie is clearly a fantasy but set in a very realistic situation.  It is an absolute celebration of the spirit....if not of anarchy.  The father in the movie deserved an Oscar nod as much as the young actrress who is the star.  In my opinion.

I know that liking a movie is a huge matter of subjective preference, and that this movie is in a rare class, but it is hypnotic in its portrayal of people who are connected to the earth and one another in a way that those who live in pricey subdivisions are not.

5121789,2,B008220AGC,"Beasts of Southern Wild is a film that was more or less hailed at the Sundance film festival, as well as receiving some important Academy Award nominations for both Best Actress as well as Best Film of the Year. None of which were deserved. In a nutshell, Beasts of Southern Wild is really just a 90 drudging minutes of mentally unbalanced poor people doing nothing interesting and making stupid decisions the entire time, which illicits no sympathy from the audience, but tries to at some points, failing completely in the end. So what makes this film such an overrated disappointment? Well, let's see.

The film opens by introducing us to a very small community of poverty stricken and from what can be seen as mentally unbalanced people living on the forgotten bayous of what I can assume is the southern United States. The main character being a little 9 year old girl who has no mother but only lives with her dad in a small shack mess of a house, where their relationship isn't exactly close but the father does randomly try to have fun with her (it really happens about twice in the movie). Right off the bat you can tell he is somewhat ill, and though he does care for his daughter, he only does so out of obligation, not because he actually enjoys her as a person in any real way. Then a far-fetched scene of a party ensues with this small community of people who seem to have a decent amount of things to live on, but are only surviving by their skin of their teeth (you wonder where they get the stuff they do live on, perhaps the garbage, because it appears they all have zero dollars to their names). Nothing is sanitary and you wonder the entire time if any of them actually work for a living, or have ever tried to. Given that they express opinions of never wanting to be a part of real society, you get the impression that there is something mentally wrong with them, yet also don't feel the least bit sorry for them, as it seems their poverty is really their own fault. What can turn some people off completely is that there are infant babies within this community, and the fact that these people are left to take care of a bunch of kids who will eventually grow up to only go to no real place in life is enough to make you not only not care for these characters, but to also outrightly dislike them.
The girl and her father don't say much, but the father does most of the talking in the movie, whereas the girl just narrates a lot. Lots of the film is just them sort of living day by day. In one scene a girl attempts to make herself a real meal by cooking cat food, and then almost breaking out a fire and almost burning their shack down. Surprisingly enough, nobody seems to care about the fact that they almost died. The father then is inexplicably missing for a while (at which point we are made to feel like an actual plot will begin), but then is found by his daughter wandering the marshes in a... hospital gown? He seems to not recognize her, yells at her to leave and then is suddenly back at home doing his normal routine. ...yea, I don't know, just a random attempt at characterization that builds no character. The two go back to this small tent they need to temporarily stay in due to the fire, and on a technical level the film's cinematography just looks uglier than you really want. The characters ""bond"" a little more by just doing random junk like arm wrestling, and you keep wondering to yourself - you people don't have to live this way!! It only becomes irritating because the movie at about a half hour in still has done nothing to make us care. The movie goes on.
We are then introduced to a junkyard ""school"" where one woman who looks like she's on crack/cocaine is given a group of about 6 kids who ""educate,"" which really comes down to her giving them her opinions on life. It is at this point where we learn about how the world is ending because the drunk lady tells of how the world will be drowned due to the water rising. Now we begin what is perhaps the most purposeless, senseless, tacked-on attempt at a running parallel in movie history. We get flashes of ice caps melting and giant prehistoric beasts surviving and floating away in ice blocks (get it? Beasts? Like, because the movie title has the world beasts in it? ...yea, exactly).

Next there is talk of a storm coming, so then again we feel like a plot will ensue. We see our main characters build a boat once this rainstorm does come and things are later shown underwater. As the movie drudges on we see the small community band together elsewhere as well as the father showing symptoms of some skin illness. He even randomly falls over early in the film, so we have major hints of an ending that we've seen 100 times before. The girl shares thoughts of her missing mother, as well as more scenes of the small community drinking together. All this done of course by your typical dark Sundance indie film cinematography and cliche shaky cam. It's really a method of filmmaking you have already seen done a billion times, it's a wonder these filmmakers couldn't think of another way to do it.
The movie you start to feel is almost a combination of documentary and actual film. Why? Because NOTHING HAS HAPPENED YET! At least not anything in a vain of character appreciation, suspense, conflict, etc. By this point we are almost an hour into the film and you sit there wondering when the movie is actually going to get on it's feet, this elongated introduction will end and something will finally HAPPEN.

Finally we see pieces of a normal society as the people are caught by authorities due to a mandatory evacuation of the area. Since the people have no televisions or way of contacting the real world, the real world authorities are almost made to look like evil alien types, just wanting to destroy their ""harmonious"" way of life, although any person with any sense will just be grateful that these poor idiots can finally be helped. Due to the hillbilly community's insistence on never being part of the real world, the filmmakers failingly try to use this part of the film to make the authorities look like the bad guys, when in fact we know they aren't, and that these poor people are just a bunch of stubborn morons.
Anyway, so the group is now at a help rescue center, where there are nurses and doctors treating people, and the little girl is actually dressed up and cleaned, and it is again, at THIS point in the film where we are made to believe the real plot will finally being (an entire HOUR into the film). But guess what? Any sort of attempt is then thwarted because these inane poor people choose to ""rebel"" and escape the rescue center they are being treated at (even the father decides to escape and refuses to take medicine, even though it is clearly seen that he is dying of whatever illness he has... gee, I WONDER what will happen to him? hmmm.... *eye roll*). So they go away yelling and screaming, and again this is an implication by the filmmakers that it is the real world that are the ""bad guys"" and these poor people are the ones who have it right because they are not tied down by societal norms, but instead can be free in all their sloppy, unsanitary, unhealthy, dangerous, and foolish independence.

The last 20 minutes of the film takes the focus away from the adults, and focuses on the kids, um, wandering around for some reason, as we see that the little girl's father is laying on his deathbed (wow! didn't see THAT one coming!) So this running parallel of the beasts have broken out of their ice cubes and are making their way towards these people, in a small lot of about 5. We don't know whether these beasts are real or imaginary, or even if they are within the girl's mind, but it is safe to assume they are not real and have some sort of parallel to these people; although absolutely NO parallel or explanation is made known to us as the audience, thus we see this as just dumb filler. The raggedy kids talk to a few other adults who say nothing memorable, and then make their way back to the dying father. It is here that these beasts are shown coming right up to the people (although it seems only the girl can see them), and the big pigs just kinda lay down and do nothing after staring at her. Whatever sort of point or moral these pigs are supposed to represent is completely negligible, as there really is none. The whole parallel was a huge waste of time (plus the special effects look terrible anyway, but since this is indie, it's forgivable). So the father dies (don't worry about this being a spoiler, you really see this one coming from the first 10 minutes of the movie) and the girl and kids are then taken by the remaining adults to a bayou bordello where some women and their male clients are dancing. The girl sees a person who she assumes is her mother (and it only took the ENTIRE movie for anything relevant to finally happen, since this assumed reunion happens with about 5 minutes left of movie time). We are never told whether this is the girl's mother or not, but if the girl thinks it is... well, I guess she thinks it is. Although due to this kid's crappy performance, she shows no sort of excitement at all about her discovery. Credits roll, the end, thank God.

In summation, what makes this movie such a failure is the fact that there is no real relevance to anything. There is no conflict between any characters, no sort of real tension, and we are never made to care for these characters because they are all so stupid and mentally unbalanced that it is very difficult for any real logical person to feel sympathy towards their situation; especially since they are endangering the lives of their children throughout, and don't care in the name of their own selfish idiotic freedom. Their poverty and living situation is really their own fault, so even as a characterization aesthetic, the movie does nothing. Next, there is no real plot to speak of, this film seems to tease at moments where an intriguing plot is to take place, but nothing even does.
Just cause I'm a nice guy, here are some suggestions to what COULD'VE happened to make this film, well, not suck so much: 1. The dad goes missing entirely and the girl must learn to survive on her own 2. the dad is abusive (this is hinted by never happens) and the girl must escape or learn to grow 3. The girl disagrees with the community's choice of lifestyle and insistence on their poverty and must break free and help them (no, this girl is just as dumb as the rest of them) 4. a tension or conflict between the kids and adults of any kind 5. beasts are real and threaten the lives of these people 6. the people TRY to get out of poverty but the real world shuns them, and then the real world can ACTUALLY be displayed as the bad guy in all their materialistic political superficiality, etc. 7. The little girl tries to create a closer relationship with her dying father...
These are just some suggestions, but they could've been used to make this film even mildly interesting. But no, what we have is just 90 minutes of poor people doing dumb things with no relevance, no underlying points, no morals, no plot, no anything. The fact that this film was so hailed by critics just once again proves that art-house critics are the most pompous people in the world and like believing they are smart enough to see things that normal movie lovers don't see. Even as a piece of filmmaking art this thing fails. The little girl's performance does not warrant an oscar nomination in any way whatsoever.

So in closing my point is pretty clear. Avoid this film. If you have to rent it, do so, but don't make the mistake I did and purchase it at full price. Just another overrated annoying mess.",1362268800,,11724,4.455772811918063

She had no one to go to and had to eat dog food to survive. The scenes where she was having to try to cook her own dog food and gravy dinner, light a stove with a blow torch and within moments it all explodes. She runs for cover and fear, not just from the fire, but the wrath of her father...she hides in a cardboard box. The fire is all around her and one waits for her to be consumed by the smoke and flames. Suddenly her father appears and chases her out. They race through the swamp, she in terror he in a drunken anger. The scenes of all the drunkeness from the men and women and the wildness of the children...I did not find to be anything but painful. The flooding of the Bathtub area was sad and the hundreds of animals drowned was a reminder of how horrific this storm was. How little help was given left me wondering. They tried to give help but the people did not want to leave what they had...I understand that, but I did not find this to be all that great a film. I guess the father taught the daughter how to survive, and as he was dying it was evident he did love her, but it left me wondering about her future. I have been orphaned, abandoned, homeless, and terrified, but I lived in a major city and had three jobs at one time to try to survive. I guess it is a city person trying to understand a backwoods-swamp existence. The hopelessness was not to my liking. This child seemed like a half wild animal running through the swamp, screaming and shouting, and the filth...I just wanted to bath her, dress her in clean clothes and show her there is something better.

Positives: Spectacular performance by Quvenzhan Wallis as ""Hushpuppy,"" as well as everyone else in the cast.

Negatives: Although it still somehow works on a limited scale, the plotline is disjointed and virtually nonsensical, and the whole scope of the film is very limited. The mythos concerning Hushpuppy's unique powers, the melting of the icecaps, and rise of the prehistoric aurochs is intriguing but maddeningly underdeveloped.

5121945,2,B008220AGC,"This movie was so highly recommended that I expected great things.  I'm ok with less than ideal living conditions and elements of a dark theme.  But one always hopes that there will be a silver lining, a positive message that shines through.  No dice with this flick.  Its one of those experiences where 1/2 of the way through, you are saying ""Surely this is going get a lot better soon.""  Then 2/3 of the way through you begin to think that isn't going to happen, but you hang on and keep watching even though your depression is increasing every 5 minutes.  At that point, you think that you've invested so much time in the film that you will stick it out.  I've seen a lot of movies and know that some of the BEST movies are those that really make you think and involve symbolism with a profound meaning.  The two of us struggled to find it.  Perhaps one has to have grown up in abject poverty in the south to understand and enjoy certain nuances.  If there is a greater meaning, someone please tell us!!  What were the prehistoric hogs about anyway?  How did they get all the way to the Bayou?  Too many questions.  It would seem that they represented the little girl's fears and strengths !??!  Honestly, I would have only given it 1 star, but this little girl's performance is nothing short of spectacular.  She IS the one shining star.  I'm looking forward to many outstanding performances in the future from her.

5121949,5,B008220AGC,"My wife and I watched the brilliant and utterly unconventional ""Beasts"" the night before the Academy Awards show, which put both the triviality of most entertainment and the promise of movies in just the right perspective. It is a perfect mind-cleanser for the craven artificiality of everyday media, from animated features to ""reality"" shows to thrillers and of course the evening news. It's a simple story: a little girl, her father woefully unprepared to care for her, and their neighbors locked in a brutal struggle to survive on the wrong side of a levee of the Mississippi in Louisiana. They live in desperate poverty within sight of the high-tech world of comfort and sophistication that you and I live in. The script does not manipulate, the actors do not strut and posture: how amazing is that? Yet the conclusion is unavoidable that our affluence cares for their state in no meaningful way.

From the first scene I was riveted to my seat with interest in the lives of people who ask nothing more than the dignity to be left alone. The girl cries out for security and comfort her father can't give her, but manages to find self-expression and delight in horrifying conditions. Her father is consumed by putting food on the table to the exclusion of almost all sentiment, but clings desperately to his will to live and scant memories of joy.

Yes, this is what life without education and opportunity looks like, and we should do better. And if we do it will be because the hunger to exist, to love, and to feel is ineradicable.",1361836800,2,1535,4.723880597014926

5122002,5,B008220AGC,"This movie is designed  to stimulate viewers to go far beyond their boundaries and delve into the lives of those Americans whose lives are never depicted in mainstream American media. As a former resident of the state of Louisiana and an activist in the Civil Rights Movement in the '60s, I was challenged to ""go on the plantations"" and into the homes of the poor workers who supported the sugar cane industry. Much like our plantation workers, the residents of the ""bathtub"" lived lives of absolute deprivation as compared to modern standards. But what came out of that movie was an incredible understanding of love of family and friends, the indomitable spirit of the human connection and that no matter where or how you live your life, pride and self-respect is yours to keep.  Quvenzhane Wallis was absolutely brilliant in this movie and it saddens me to think that while she was nominated for an Academy Award, that she was not recognized as a 6 year old child who grabbed your heart at the beginning of the movie and still has not let go. Excellent movie all around and I would advise anyone to purchase if  ""your heart is captured by this movie"" you will want to see more than once the brilliant performance of ""Hushpuppy"" and the creative energy of all those who made this picture a seminal piece of American art.",1361750400,,1321,4.660944206008583

The story was an interesting look at a world few of us have experienced.  That said, I found myself partially bored though most of it.  I did want to see what happened to the characters, especially the girl, but a meandering story of some swamp folk told though the eyes of a five year old....I was expecting more imagination and flights of fancy.  Instead I got a depressing plot about some very ignorant people and a slightly abused little girl with a sick father. It was touching how they did love each other and he was preparing her for life without him, but that wasn't enough to make me want to go out and recommend this one to friends.

I bought a Blu-ray copy, invited over some friends (all lovers of alternative film), handed out the beer and chips and sat down to see what it had to say about Louisiana.. After about fifteen minutes of respectful silence we turned to each other and said...who are these people?

I have lived here all of my life and I'm well acquainted with people who live off the many bayous and wetlands, even impoverished ones. I have NEVER seen anyone live like this. To make matters worse for the non-native, a slurred dialect is spoken through much of the film and it is twice as challenging to understand because of poor sound quality. We did like the part where they blew up the alligator, but we don't do that either. You can add to the things we have never seen, boat motors on truck beds and black folks conducting Viking style funerals. All news to us. You should know that any decent funeral around here requires a brass band. We have had a few unique ones but the body has to be there to oversee the festivities. Google ""Uncle Lionel Batiste Wake"" for a look at just how creative we can be.

The people in the film did not seem like actors ... Dwight Henry must be Wink in real life and Quvenzhane Wallis must be Hushpuppy - otherwise, how could they do what they did in this film?

5122184,5,B008220AGC,"This movie just about killed me. I didn't know much about it other than a line or two I'd seen here and there. I kept hearing about Quvenzhan Wallis and saw an interview of her recently, which made me decide to rent this today. I don't know what I was expecting, but based on the bit I'd read about the movie, it wasn't this. At all. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I pretty much cried through the whole thing.

Quvenzhan is an amazing actress. There were times it almost seemed impossible that she was a kid, like somehow they'd found an adult to pretend to be a little girl. Even the way she narrated-- her tone alone gave indication of when she was fully believing what she was saying, and when she was just repeating something she'd been told and didn't really question it, the way kids do. But it wasn't only her. All the actors and actresses built this into a multi-layered story.

The way Dwight Henry's part was done was also very well done. It's hard to explain, but this movie does an excellent job of telling an adult story and a kid's story at the same time. I could see how things would seem to Hushpuppy because it made complete sense how she rationalized things, or when she got upset or scared. At the same time, I could read into her dad's actions and words to understand that there was something more happening in the background. It made it even more sad, because they were both trying so hard to be strong and powerful, but there are some things you can't fight against no matter how strong a will you have.

I also loved the way it was filmed; it built into the narrative very well, I thought, because it reflected the way Hushpuppy viewed the world-- stable and unstable, focused and unfocused, full of wondrous things and full of things that are painfully realistic.

I guess the short of this is that I was really impressed with this film and definitely plan to buy it.",1360972800,,1917,4.361344537815126

The existence this society leads, and their determination to maintain it, varies from dazzling to upsetting to unfamiliar. The landscapes provided by their living quarters, a hodgepodge of dilapidated machinery and augmented nature, are beautifully photogenic in an extraterrestrial sense. And while I'm sure some of those aspects were exaggerated, as were the bland, sterile confines of the film's brief stay in more ""civilized"" confines, the contrast between the two is remarkable and thoughtful, as intended. Although it can be self-indulgent and drawn out at times, the film is a real sight to behold and quite moving when it wants to be.

It is not easy for me to be so captivated, as I write drama and am always aware of technique.  But, not with his film!  I was transported to another world of New Orleans swamp people living in contemporary times.

The acting was superb!  Young Ms. Wallis deserves an Academy Award!  Her rough-and-tumble character, Hush Puppy, broke my heart but transported my spirit with her will to SURVIVE despite the ravages of poverty and not having a mother.  She only has a seriously ill alcoholic father and a band of other alcoholic, filthy swamp people to look after her, though they can hardly look after themselves-- but they are a family of sorts.

The texture of this film was so gritty and dirty, I still can't shake it off! The surreal quality reminds me of Lord of the Flies.  The juxtaposition of the basest elements of life against the magical, mystical moments of childhood  demonstrate the  writer's and director's belief that the human spirit is transcendent!

Wallis truly embodies the innocence and wild nature of how a child copes, and every copes, with adversity in nature. The Bath Tub isn't an imagined place but a place where people have formed their own culture outside the conventionality most people take for granted. Hushpuppy is the product of that sub-culture, and one not just of a mother and father, but an entire community and way of life; filled with their own tales and verbal histories told in allegory like in the days of old. When reality comes knocking and mother nature takes her due, this community's survival depends on their shared beliefs as seen through the eyes of Hushpuppy as she seeks to survive against an impending doom and questions of her own past.",1360627200,2,940,4.737804878048781

5122293,3,B008220AGC,"Not quite sure what to make of this unusual film.  It has a surreal fable-like quality  and is unlikely to be similar to much else that you have seen.  Little girl Hushpuppy lives in the bayou backwater with her single-parent Dad and a host of colorful, down-and-out characters.  Melting ice caps and global warming trigger severe weather and flooding of their idyllic backwater refuge, ""The Bathtub.""  Their cup (and island) runneth over, but they are nevertheless reluctant to abandon it.  As Dorothy said in The Wizard of Oz, ""There's no place like home.""

What follows is a Homeric quest by Hushpuppy to reunite with her mother, who apparently abandoned her earlier -- and to return with Daddy and neighbors to their sodden path of ground at The Bathtub.

Residents of the Bathtub are depicted as noble savages -- partying and having a good time despite the squalor of their conditions.  The film posits a tiresome dichotomy between their life and the presumed life of the more developed world across the levees.  Poor people = Good.  Developed society = Bad.

This Rousseau-like depiction breaks down for me somewhat, as the ""noble savages"" on the Bathtub isle seem to largely pass the time drinking, groping and passing out.  (Plus, they are in dire need of dental work.) The denizens of the developed world have their helicopters and megaphones, ordering the determined residents of the mud patch to evacuate, scheming to place them in shelters where they would receive a clean environment, food and medical care.  Why would anyone want to leave their muddy squalor for features like that?

Meanwhile, some menacing/mythical creatures called Aurucs are unleashed by the melting polar caps and swim to the Gulf to menace the populace of the Bathtub.

What will happen during the face-off between these beasts and Hushpuppy?  Will Hushpuppy reunite with her mother?  Will her father survive his illness?

5122407,1,B008220AGC,"***This review may contain spoilers***

Every year, the critics seem to fall in love with one horribly overrated film. Last year it was 'The Artist', a derivative tale filmed in the long-defunct style of a silent movie. At least 'The Artist' won points for capturing a certain style of filmmaking, but this year's candidate for most pretentious and overrated film, 'The Beasts of the Southern Wild', almost defies description.

Anyway, I'll try. Don't expect any attempt here to create characters that have any relation to real people. 'Beasts' is designed to enter the realm of myth. We're taken to a mythical land dubbed 'The Bathtub', a Louisiana Bayou community cut off from the rest of the world by a levee. The houses (if you can call them that), appear to be nothing more than ramshackle shelters, in what appears to be a post-Katrina environment.

Almost every critic seems to be taken in by the youngest actor ever to be nominated for a Best Actress Oscar: six-year-old (now nine) Quevenzhan Wallis. Wallis (in the role of 'Hushpuppy') really should be nominated for best acting in a horror film as she plays an emotionally distant, pyromaniac who is the victim of child abuse on the part of her father, Wink, who actually slaps the child, causing her to fall violently to the ground. If you can believe this, the rambunctious Hushpuppy retaliates in kind, by striking Wink, who briefly appears to lose consciousness.

Director Benh Zeitlin attempts to mitigate Wink's violent demeanor, by depicting him as some kind of 'tough love' saint, who saves the child through a raging Katrina-like storm, after constructing a floating shelter out of flood debris. At one point, Crazy Wink fends off the storm by shooting at the clouds, reassuring the now scared child. Later, he hatches an ill-advised plan to drain salt water brought in by the storm surge, by dynamiting the levee. The bottom line is that Zeitlin wants it both ways: Wink is both a violent child abuser but underneath, a self-sacrificing and devoted father. How touching!

If this isn't ridiculous enough, the townspeople are all dysfunctional with drinking problems. After everyone is evacuated by FEMA-like stooges, Hushpuppy's comrades all make a beeline back to their ruined, condemned community. These salt of the earth are particularly good at sucking the heads of craw-fish. David Edelstein in New York Magazine puts it best when describing the denizens of the mythical Bathtub: ""Late in the film, Hushpuppy's surrogate family is absurdly romanticized, their drunken dysfunction ennobled, as if living below sea level puts you on a higher spiritual plane.""

Don't ask me to explain the meaning of the actual 'beasts' of the film's title. In the beginning of the film, we learn that melting polar ice caps are releasing prehistoric creatures called 'Aurochs'. During a screening, I learned that a separate camera crew took ten days to film five-month-old pigs dressed up with horns, to suggest giant wild boars. Hushpuppy later bonds with the creatures after she returns to the 'Bathtub' with a coterie of inebriated allies.

Wouldn't you know it that Wink has contracted a terminal illness and Hushpuppy is there for a grand send-off at the funeral pyre. That, dear friends, is 'Beasts of the Southern Wild' in a nutshell. Everyone turns out to be wonderful in the end, including the former child abuser but now lovable (but terminally ill), Wink. And no one (including government 'fiends') can stop the wonderful salt of the earth from getting back to their roots in the Bathtub, including the oh so lovable but hyperactive Hushpuppy.

This time, it's Sundance that must take principal responsibility for releasing this drivel to the world. On the other hand, every festival can't be perfect. Let's forgive Sundance for this misstep and pray they don't make the same mistake when next year's festival rolls around.",1359936000,30,3891,5.040435458786936
5122408,3,B008220AGC,"Despite the mystical allusions of the title and a few dreamlike sequences, this is primarily the story of a very small girl growing up under extremely difficult circumstances. As such, for me it was neither joyous nor enjoyable to watch. The symbolism of ""the beasts"" is never made very clear; I kept waiting for a transformation or at least a spiritual revelation that never arrived. What does happen is a little girl soldiers up and hardens herself to meet adversity while still retaining the dreams and needs of such a small child. The cinematography is interesting, especially the party scenes, but the film is essentially gritty, showing the darkest side of a poor and deeply damaged bayou community. Another tough one to watch.",1359936000,,733,4.967479674796748

I highly recommend the movie and hope it wins everything.",1359936000,,418,4.819444444444445
5122420,1,B008220AGC,This movie was very depressing although the acting seemed good. The story also left too many holes unfilled. Don't watch this unless you want to see what happened to New Orleans' poorest areas after Hurricane Katrina.,1359936000,,217,5.055555555555555
5122421,2,B008220AGC,"Ah, the joys of poverty.  It's really a load off when you don't have to worry about being shackled to a job, or having to please your boss, or accumulating an excess of money.  The fortunate poor can spend their days getting in tune with nature or drinking with a few of their best friends.  Who needs money when mother earth seems so willing to spontaneously generate grains, potable water, and livestock?

 At least this seems to be the message of Beasts of the Southern Wild, the type of movie about a poor community in the South that could only have been made by a member of the bourgeois from Williamsburg, Brooklyn.  Beasts of the Southern Wild is an insidious film.  It purports to be about people struggling to make it in the world, but it's actually about the urban elite's desire to take a camping trip, get away from the hustle of the city, and maybe go canoeing.

 The movie doesn't take place in our world, not exactly.  Instead the movie attempts to craft a world of magical realism where a large scale ecological disaster can unfreeze giant boars and where crushing poverty is a choice rather than a failure of the economy.  And yet at the same time the film wants to be about the effects of Hurricane Katrina on the New Orleans's underclass.  It would be easy to claim that the movie can't have it both ways--that it can't be a fantasy world that also grapples with difficult real world problems.  But of course that's just not true.  Plenty of movies have delved into the world of make believe in order to get a better perspective on real world events.  The problem is that Beasts just doesn't do this very well.

 Beasts's protagonists is Hushpuppy, a girl about nine years old who lives with her drunken abusive father in a place called the Bathtub.  In what's assuredly one step removed from images of the noble savage, the movie portrays the denizens of the Bathtub as self-sufficient people who love drinking, dancing, and fireworks.  Their world is eventually upended when some sort of environmental catastrophe ends up flooding the Bathtub and everything else below a series of levees.  While a number of people choose to pack up and leave before they get hit with the flood, Hushpuppy and her father decide to face the storm head on, and they eventually hold up with several other men women and children who also refused to leave their homes.  Even after the flood they appear to manage pretty well until, that is, a group of faceless government agents apparently borrowed from E.T. come across these survivors.  The last residents of the Bathtub are taken to a hospital where they are forced to get medical attention and Hushpuppy even has to wear a dress.  But Hushpuppy and her folks haven't given up yet.  They organize a prison break of sorts, which, as far as I can tell, consists mostly of pushing over several doctors and nurses who seemed uninterested in chasing them down in the first place.

 If we are going to read this narrative as a corollary to New Orleans after Katrina (and the film seems to invite this reading), then there are a number of problems.  Where the film shows Bathtub residents choosing either to flee or wait out the storm, a large majority of New Orleans residents had no such choice.  Many people stayed in New Orleans prior to the storm because they did not have the money, the transportation, or the accommodations to get out of the city.  To represent this as a clear choice, and, furthermore, to suggest that those who left were running away like wimps (not the film's preferred choice of words), is at best lunkheaded and at worst offensive to those who died during Hurricane Katrina.  Later the film suggests that Hushpuppy, her father and the rest would have been fine if the ""gul' dern gov'ment"" hadn't gotten into their business.  The central problem after Hurricane Katrina wasn't too much government--it was that the government had essentially disowned an entire city.  In fact, the people of New Orleans had difficulty getting any substantive assistance from their own government for a number of days.

 I could go on about the film's uneven handling of alcohol, its narrative failures, and total lack of characterization beyond Hushpuppy.  But because my mother taught me right, I'll end by pointing out a few things I liked.  The visuals are at times striking (even if a little too reminiscent of those pretentious Levi's ads).  Quvenzhan Wallis turns in a great performance in the lead role, especially considering that she has to pretty much carry the entire movie.  I admit that I enjoyed watching her run around and yell like an animal.  And the giant boars were pretty cool.  Maybe next time the director should include more giant boars.",1359936000,5,4715,4.71638141809291
5122422,5,B008220AGC,"The acting by six-year-old Quvenzhan Wallis was astonishing. The story clearly depicts the cultural gap between the indigenous people of Gulf tidewater and the ""civilized"" people who seek to rescue them. The film has a mythic quality.",1359936000,,234,5.351351351351352

No, I don't mean that it was fun to watch people struggling to survive in such heart-wrenching poverty in New Orleans, but wonderful in that the movie shows the father's profound love for his child in the face of unbelievable harsh environment.  Two AMAZING actors beautifully played that indomitable human spirit.  Quvenzhane Wallis, the little girl who plays the daughter, certainly deserved to be nominated for Oscar, but where was the nomination for Dwight Henry, the actor who plays her father?  This guy is not even an actor, but a New Orleans BAKER!  He was EXTREMELY convincing as the drunken, terminally ill father who tried to teach his only child how to survive on her own.  (Did I mention that she was 6 years old?)  He can certainly compete with any of the nominees in the Best Actor's category!

Some people may find this movie bit ""artsy"" in that there are surreal images thrown in throughout the movie.  You either like it, or you don't.  Personally, I thought the images add to the rhythm of the movie.

I was looking forward to this highly praised movie. The young actress Quvenzhan Wallis did a terrific job, the movie showed the squalor these people live in very lively, and the devastation to their home was well-felt.
However, I cannot give it more than one star. I don't know what the director was thinking. Using the so-called reality format as a lame excuse to not buying a tripod does not cut it. The constantly shaking picture, in addition frequently going in and out of focus, quenched any positive viewing experience very efficiently. I got a headache and only sat through it because I really liked the little girl actress' performance.
An advice to the director and camera guy. Spend $100 and buy a tripod! In addition, learn how to focus a movie, and you'll get a result that will be so much better than this movie. I don't know why the critics went so haywire over it because using the reality format is just a lazy and stupid excuse for not doing the work properly.

5122619,4,B008220AGC,"At some point, anyone who watches this wonderful film is going to have to make a decision: what part of this is straightforward storytelling, and what part of this is fantasy?

""The Beasts of the Southern Wild"" cannot really be said to be 100 percent one or the other.

To simply suggest it is an allegory of how some of the extremely rural Louisiana bayou people (prophetically called ""The Bathtub"") survived a massive storm would be simplistic.  But to think that it tells a literal story would be just as incorrect.  The answer lies in young nine-year old Hushpuppy's visions--are they fantasies?  Are they prophetic?  And what part of what we are viewing is supposed to be ""real""?

For it is Hushpuppy (played flawlessly by Quvenzhane Wallis, the youngest person ever nominated for an Oscar) who forms the nucleus of ""Beasts,"" and it is her visions that create strange diversions from the narration.  Spurred on by the words of a Bathtub woman named Miss Bathsheba--who taught them about cave drawings of prehistoric man, and mysterious, marauding beasts called the Aurochs--these fantasies were as much inspiration as they were a retreat from fear.

On one hand it can be inferred that these visions denote a vast, End Time-like destruction--coming at the hands of global warming, the melting of the ice caps, and the release of these fearsome, wild Aurochs (giant, tusked boar-like creatures the size of elephants), or it may simply be that they represent childhood fantasies at work in her overactive imagination, a mental counterpart to the destruction of not only ""The Bathtub,"" but perhaps the place of her father in her world as well.

To be sure, Hushpuppy spends a lot of her life on her own, cradled by her supra-natural bond with the creatures of the bayou.  That she is constantly looking for her much-absent father is interesting, as she is evidently frightened of him as well.  Her father Wink (played by Dwight Henry) is a mess, less often helpful than he is abusive, and prone to drunken rage: ""Don't yo look at me!  Don't yo look at me! How m'I `posed to sleep yo lookin at me!"" Though he often says, ""I got it under control,"" there is rarely a time where anything he does makes the least amount of sense--at one point, as a peace offering, he actually makes his daughter drink alcohol with him.

One can understand the mixture of emotions he evokes in her: at one point she screams at him, ""I hope you die, and when yo die I go to your grave and eat birthday cake all by myself""

Spurred on by the teachings of a Bathtub woman named Miss Bathsheba--who taught them about cave drawings of the prehistoric man (as well as the Aurochs)--Hushpuppy is frequently seen creating her own ""cave drawings"" as well.  This by itself is not surprising...she is an impressionable child, after all.  But it is of interest that Hushpuppy draws them because she has visions of the demise of the Bathtub (at least): ""One day I see the things I made flyin all around,"" she says.  ""When I die, the scientists of the future, they can find it all.""

In fact, one wonders if the community isn't also a bit delusional, given their destitute lives and garbage-can homes they cling to like a second skin.  Their impoverishment is monumental, but they manage, and to them this world of theirs is their Eden, the life they want. One might argue that the impoverishment of these people is monumental, but ""Beasts"" paints them as citizens of their form of Utopia, living their own particular Life of Plenty.  Whether this, too, is a fantasy--this time on the part of the whole community--is also up for grabs.

What IS true, though, is that this magical, mystical movie is both moving and interpretive, and will mean many things to many people.  Certainly, one thing that most will agree on is the remarkable performance of Quvenzhane Wallis, an amazing find who will move you with her haunting eyes and manner, as piercing and unforgettable as her scream.

5122734,4,B008220AGC,"I think a viewer has to like magical realism and fantasy more than I do to fall in love completely with ""Beasts of the Southern Wild."" This tale of a completely unplugged society is better than OK, though, so four stars.

Six-year-old Hushpuppy lives in a waterlogged, racially mixed Louisiana Bayou community called ""The Bathtub"" with her father Wink. Hushpuppy's mother ""swam away"" shortly after Hushpuppy's birth. The inhabitants of The Bathtub all seem to have eccentric names, drink a great deal of moonshine, live in houses made of scrap metal and other junk, travel around on the water in odd vessels (Wink's boat appears to be a converted pickup truck) and live off the land and water. Wink feeds Hushpuppy chickens he raises, kills and cooks himself on a gas barbecue, and crayfish he catches. Hushpuppy rips the meat off the bones with her teeth, ""like a beast."" At school, instead of a typical curriculum, Miss Bathsheba teaches the Bathtub children survival skills and warns that because of global warming, the waters will rise and the community will wash away. In spite of this looming danger, or perhaps because of it, every day is a holiday in the Bathtub, Hushpuppy says. The tough residents of The Bathtub like their independent, slow-paced, free and easy way of life--""beasts"" and proud of it. No crying allowed, Wink tells Hushpuppy.

In response to government hurricane warnings, most residents evacuate, but Hushpuppy, Wink and a few other stubborn holdouts remain in The Bathtub, fortifying their homes and moving themselves and their possessions onto their roofs. The storm subsides and the high waters recede, but the storm's mixing of the salt water with the fresh has killed all the fish, making the old ways of survival impossible. At the same time, Wink becomes terribly ill. The drama centers around how Hushpuppy and the other Bathtub dwellers will weather these crises.

Quvenzahne Wallis, in her first role, lights up the screen as the fiercely independent Hushpuppy. The other performers, mostly residents of Terrebonne Parish in Louisiana rather than professional actors, do pretty well considering their lack of experience.

While I liked the settings, I tired of the jittery handheld camerawork in a hurry. The fantasy elements did not appeal to me.  The Hushpuppy character struck me as impossibly precocious and the Hushpuppy name as impossibly precious. I kept wondering why nobody had a name like Anne or Joe. I found the parallel between Wink's health and the health of the Bathtub too obvious and heavy-handed. I could not figure out where the people in the Bathtub got the money for fuel for their boats and barbecues and their obviously factory-made clothes.  Overall there were enough irritants to keep me from giving the movie five stars.

Still, this sweet film celebrates people who live in the present. It held my attention and I expect it will hold most people's. Worth seeing. Wonderful music.",1359158400,2,2944,5.032854209445585

had to overstate this film in such a grandiose way. I think it diminshed the obvious quality

The little girl put on a good performance.

The title is apt. The entire movie reminded me of the opening scenes of ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" (The Dawn of Man)

Cons:

Mediocre to poor photography, camera wobbled all over the place, bad editing.

Often-indistinguishable dialog.

No character development. One feels sorry for the girl but not because one gets to know her.

No real story, per se, just a sliver of a common thread across many confusing, disjointed scenes.

Mostly a ""feel bad"" theme (some graphically unpleasant moments).

Comment:

Perhaps this movie merely intended to portray a few days in the life of the Bayou in all of its primitiveness and ghastliness. I suppose it succeeds.

5122802,4,B008220AGC,"Quvenzhan Wallis proves that great things do come in small packages, as she delivers a bravura performance that elevates this small budget film to epic proportions.  There is a lot one could quibble over in the way of story, but the natural acting and visceral situations more than make up for the strange turns and plot holes in the script.  Benh Zeitlin and Lucy Aliber have given us a wonderful post-Katrina parable.

The idea of a ""Bathtub"" community riding out Katrina and relishing the momentary embarrassment of riches that came in the way of fish is soon belied by the fact that there is no fresh water to sustain this bountiful new world.  Hushpuppy soon realizes this and seeks to find an answer to the dilemma while her father plots to blow up a levee to end their drought.

The confrontations that ensue are pretty much what you would expect, but the writers keep this film floating between fantasy and reality like a Gabriel Garcia Marquez novella.  Hushpuppy and the girls go in search of their mothers, a scene that poignantly sums up their sense of desolation while at the same time giving them renewed hope.  It really is remarkable how Zeitlin was able to draw so much from these first time actors, making the story all the more compelling.

The aurochs are a bit too much like Terrence Mallick's dinosaurs in The Tree of Life, but work within the world of Hushpuppy's feverish imagination, as she tries to make sense of what Miss Bathsheba has been telling her.  I found the scenes where the community is rescued and takien to a shelter a bit incongruous and hard to figure how they all so easily ended up back at the ""Bathtub,"" but I suppose Zeitlin and Aliber felt it necessary to make a connection with the outside world.  Would have probably been better to maintain the distance, but otherwise great movie!",1358899200,,1829,4.669781931464175

I was hovering over London when the film ended and I remember struggling to process everything as I was hustling to get from one terminal to another and I had planned on watching it a second time while on my second flight only to find out that there were no inflight movies going forward.  I had to wait another month before I could get my hands on the film a second time, but it was that second viewing that cemented all I thought I knew and actually helped grow the film in my personal esteem.  It is a beautiful work of art; a film that is so special and so unique that little else I can even think of compares the strength with which it propels its prose.  Saddled on the shoulders of two non-actors, and prodded along by a first time director, `Beasts of the Southern Wild' is a film that could and probably should have failed and yet every minute detail feels so richly uncovered and it is one of those films that certainly grows with each repeat viewing.

It is beautiful.

`Beasts of the Southern Wild' tells the story of Hushpuppy, a young girl living with her alcoholic father in the Louisiana bayou.  Hushpuppy's home life is less than desirable.  Her mother is absent and her father is not only dependent on the drink, but he is emotionally unstable and thus reacts in ways that shun and alienate Hushpuppy.  Still, the Bathtub (the area in which they live) is her home and all she knows and so when her life is threatened by an impending storm, things take a drastic change of pace and thrust Hushpuppy and her father into a new adventure.

While some may balk at the progression of the film, I have to stand back and say that this film NEEDS to be considered as a whole, because it is in the rapturous finale (yes, tears were rolling down my face) that the whole thing comes together in such a beautiful way.  In a way, `Beasts of the Southern Wild' reminds me of `Where the Wild Things Are' from 2009.  It finds such complex and adult ways of addressing childhood and the necessity (sadly) of growing up so fast.  Hushpuppy is such an insightful young child growing up in a dark and scary place and yet it is home for her and it is something she knows and understands.  The heartbreak of childhood is explored with such depth, yet it is never heavy handed (Zeitlin's Oscar nomination is so richly deserved).  The search for Hushpuppy's mother and the connection with her father Wink is done so beautifully, and the organic performances by Wallis and Henry are such beautiful centerpieces for this fantastic film.

Honestly, the more I think about this movie the more I'm convinced it is a masterpiece.",1358726400,,3042,4.480072463768116

5122842,1,B008220AGC,"OK, so here's the synopsis: a little girl of six or so is living in the most abject filth and squalor with a physically and emotionally abusive father, an absent mother and an isolated collection of misfits who seem to spend most of their time drunk and carousing. For an hour and a half the little girl uses her imagination to conjure up Aurochs, bovine animals extinct for several centuries now and improbably played by pot-bellied pigs dressed up in nutria skins and foam horns and tusks who emerge out of glaciers in Louisiana to help her cope with circumstances she can't control. With me so far?

Through storms, fires, beatings, alcoholic rages, sabotage of government property (a levee), a revolt in a hospital, this ragamuffin gives her sage opinions about life from a six-year-old's insightful (?) perspective, stays filthily dressed except for a brief moment in the hospital when she is bathed, her hair brushed, and she is given a dress. And at the end of the movie no one is any better off than they were at the beginning and they have learned nothing from their adventures. Terrible plot premise, clumsily executed and emotionally manipulative. A total waste of time.",1358726400,26,1181,4.846534653465347
5122843,1,B008220AGC,"I saw the movie in an art film cinema last weekend and I am still angry about two lost hours. The trailer looked promising like a fairy tale for grown ups or postapocalyptic film like ""Mad Max"" or at least like Peter Weir's classic ""The last wave"" but ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" does in no way meet these expectations. What thus could be a surprise turned into two long hours of disecting the uninteresting and poor lives of dysfunctional outcasts in a Bayou called ""the bathtub"".  The story focusses on a single dad who is keeping his small daughter Hushpuppy in her own trailer yards away of his own cabin of dump because he avoids any emotional contact. He is a hopeless drunk and so are his friends who inhabit the only shabby bar of this place. The shaman female of the village who is also the teacher of the community predicts the meltdown of the arctic glaciers to her students and that a big storm and flood will come. The flood comes and with it some black pigs with glued-on horns filmed in slo-mo to make them ""look dangerous"" (very poor special effect but intended to look artsy). Why they are called aurochses remains unclear but they feast on small kids like Hushpuppy and are supposed to be frightening (but are not). Since after the storm most houses are gone and due to danger of plagues from rotten water the ""bathtub crowd"" is rescued to a shelter against their will. There Hushpuppy's dad is diagnosed with end-stage cancer but refuses treatment because he wants to live ""free"". So do his friends and they all escape the shelter by kidnapping a bus, except Hushpuppy who takes her little friends on a swim to a boat which brings them to a shabby love shack where Hushpuppy's mother is the chef. She prepares deep fried alligator nuggets which have ""magic abilities"". Hushpuppy takes them home to feed her dying father with them and he dies anyway but recalls that his wife has cooked the same dish before she left him. The aurochs pig beasts are tamed by Hushpuppy, who has conquered her fear of them and they are sent back to where they came from. Hushpuppy sets the family boat with the corpse of her dad on fire as a funeral ritual while the ""bathtub crowd"" who is mourning on the shore behind her is witnessing that Hushpuppy has become a 6 year old looking grown up. End of story and unfortunately there is really nothing behind it. I have seldomly seen a film like this where no single character raised any interest or sympathy with me. Of course, some critics may now say: But these Bayou people wanna live free and the kids are becoming so independent when deprived from any positive role model and forced to crack the crab's shell with plain finger force and no cutlery. In an opening scene the father throws a roasted chicken at Hushpuppy and she mauls it with her fingers and shares parts with a dog and a pig. Wow, this is so tribal , primitive and pure (irony). My answer is if they are so happy, then why is everybody always drunk or drinking? And where do they get the money to buy food, drinks etc. since no one seems to work? If it was not for the storm the cheap shacks would have collapsed in short time anyway burying the people in all the dirt and mess. I guess it is easy to ""envy"" these people as being free and living simple lifes but then return to the own cosy and neat home, which is nothing but voyeurism and exploitation especially since most of the people act like being imbecile or on crystal meth. And to portray people in the Bayou like that was surely not the intention by the filmmakers I guess. Several moments of the film were quite depressing because of scenes so full of hopelessness when people were victims of the elements. They were so thrown back to themselves and their low lives being unable to handle it, which was almost physically painful to watch. However, the performance of the little actress playing Hushpuppy is quite good for her age, but her esoteric sentences from the off like ""everything is connected"" or ""at night it is darker than at day"" and the like reminds one of books like Sophie's World and other pseudophylosophic nonsense made me really angry after a while.

I replayed that at least 10 times on TIVO and couldn't figure it out.  So if that was the key to the whole thing, it went right by me.

If the point of the movie was to show the absolute squalor that some people have to endure in this supposedly greatest country in the world ... or if it was to show how some children adapt to it ... then this movie did a wonderful job.

This ""slice"" rests on the most destructive and redemptive aspects of love as seen through the wisdom and blindness of a child.  At the end of a beautiful and horrible story, I realized it was was also based on an adult fairy tale........about the right to live independently,  without thought beyond subsistence,  without responsibility, without connection to a greater world,  maintained by a steady infusion of chemical happiness.  After all the credits rolled and I sat in the quiet dark, I saw the movie as a choice. In the end there was nothing.........a group of people surrounded by nothing, knowing nothing,  We have met a strong, courageous child  with not one bridge to what is before her.

The viewpoint is screwy.  All of the adult characters in the movie are complete reprobates, but they seem to be the heros of the film.  This may be because the story is told primarily from the viewpoint of a child, and I can understand the idea that a child that age thinks that the adults in her world are basically good.  That would make for an interesting film.  But if this is the point of the film, then it is too subtly made, as you can see if you read the positive reviews here.

Instead the people living in this town are glorified as some sort of primal humans, almost like a indigenous tribe heading for extinction. But they're not.  They are just a bunch of idiotic alcoholics.

So I was pretty much cheering for social services to come take this child to the mainland the whole time.

I couldn't wait to get the package open when it came today, and I can't wait to watch it again. There are so many layers of human experience and wisdom packed into this seemingly simple, little film. The performances by these residents of southern Louisiana are extraordinary. I imagine they are really playing themselves, an extremely difficult thing for most people to do. Dwight Henry is gut-wrenching as the troubled and troubling father, Wink. If Quvenzhane Wallis does not win the Oscar, it will be a crime against nature. Her narration is totally compelling.

Ben Zeitlin says to his troop in the making of video that this may be their one chance to make a movie - I devoutly hope he is wrong.

This is not a film for some in the American audience. Too human, too true, too honest. It is about character, not explosions or car chases. Don't get me wrong; I love those too if they're good, but this is a film for the thinking viewer; the one who hopes to learn something that may change their perspective on life and the world we all live in, even when it seems so very different from ours at first.

Depressingly optimistic and beautifully ugly. Beasts of the Southern Wild makes contradictions work to its extreme benefit. Beasts of the Southern Wild is a movie that audiences experience more than simply watch. The truly amazing thing is not only do they experience a unique story with interesting visuals but they experience it all through the eyes of a child.

One of the most unique stories of 2012 Beasts takes place in a small island separated by the mainland by a man made levee. The residents of this small island affectionately call it the Bathtub. The residents have a unique sense of community and feel that this place is not only their rightful home but is true freedom. Newcomer Quvenzhan Wallis plays Hushpuppy a little girl growing up rough with only her angry father as a guide. Hushpuppy is a strangely optimistic child when the audience first meets her despite her tough upbringing. Wink (Dwight Henry) is Hushpuppys father. He is a harsh man but he loves his daughter in his own unique way. Wink teaches Hushpuppy how to cope in their limited scope of the world and his life lessons are harsh and strange to outsiders but seem to be what Hushpuppy needs for life in the Bathtub. Hushpuppys life gets turned upside down by massive events out of anyones control and Beasts becomes a story about children in extreme circumstances.

Saying the movie is depressingly optimistic is very literal. Hushpuppy leads a hard life and she is surrounded by hard ship. When things look grim they somehow always get worse. The optimism comes from the purity and innocence of childhood. Part of Hushpuppy being able to cope with the hardships she faces is her unique education and rough upbringing. The other part is how a childs mind perceives and processes things differently from an adult. The scenes with Hushpuppy and her father coming to grips with things together are spectacular. Hushpuppy also has her own unique way of seeing the world. Much of the movie is shot at very low angles so the childs point of view is quite literal. There are also scenes that are real enough to be believable but also skewed just enough to be seen through her eyes.

The audience never questions whether any of the actors are actually from the Bathtub. The movie could almost be a documentary instead of a Drama with the realism portrayed in all of the characters. Hushpuppy was Quvenzhan Wallis first job acting. Having to lie about her age to be old enough to tryout she won the part and showed that she truly earned it. In a year full of astounding performances from some of Hollywoods biggest names one of the most impressive performances in any movie was that of a six year old who had never acted professionally before. As the story progresses you are not only engaged enough to see how it all turns out but you truly care for the future and well being of the child. Almost equally as impressive is Dwight Henry as Wink, Hushpuppys father. Another new comer to acting, Henry had to play abrasive and rash while still showing immense love for Wallis. Playing mean opposite a small child can never be easy and playing mean opposite a child with kind and caring undertones has to be even harder. Both Wallis and Henry deliver flawless performances. The rest of the cast is two-dimensional. Witty nicknames and some long established inside jokes between the characters show them as staples in the community but no one is really given material to dive into since the story focuses on Hushpuppy.

Beasts of the Southern Wild is a must see. Some of the best acting in any movie in recent memory is showcased in this original story. Quvenzhan Wallis may be the best child actor of all time and her career will be very interesting to watch develop. There is no mystery why Beasts is a 2012 Best Picture Nominee.",1358121600,,3807,4.71021021021021
5123119,4,B008220AGC,"I was naturally curious to see how a nine-year-old could have landed an Oscar nomination as Best Leading Actress, and clearly director Benh Zeitlin found a gifted child in Quvenzhan Wallis, who was actually only five during filming. As Hushpuppy, she provides the precocious voice of this fascinating 2012 film that mixes a stream-of-consciousness narrative with elements of magical realism, the combination of which can be both jarring and moving at the same time. Although the story is steeped in the harsh poverty of the coastal parishes of Louisiana, the movie comes across as a fanciful parable because Zeitlin, along with co-writer Lucy Alibar (whose one-act play ""Juicy and Delicious"" provides the basis of the plot), has effectively captured something celebratory about the struggles of a community who subsists on a bayou island cut off by a levee, appropriately dubbed the ""Bathtub"".

In sharp contrast to the unconditionally loving spirit shown by her neighbors, Hushpuppy's father Wink is alternately abusive and protective toward her. As it turns out, he is gravely ill and preparing her for life without him. For a novice filmmaker, Zeitlin does a surprisingly dexterous job of melding the fantastical with the realistic, although I have to admit that the periodically stampeding appearance of the long-extinct Aurochs, a primitive and much larger ancestor of today's cattle, comes across as increasingly contrived. There are similarly anomalous passages throughout the film, but what grounds the fantasy is the volatile relationship between Hushpuppy and Wink. Wallis is a captivating presence that packages a unique blend of innocence and fearlessness into a preternaturally wise child.

Another non-professional, Dwight Henry, a baker by trade, turns in an unexpectedly powerful performance as Wink, bringing out the desperation of a broken man with little time to sort out his anger and fear. Credit should be given to cinematographer Ben Richardson, who brings a unity of vision in an otherwise chaotic whirl of activity, even if taking Hushpuppy's perspective means the handheld camera brings a wobbly intensity that can get a bit nerve-racking. A versatile talent, Zeitlin also co-wrote the stirring, evocative soundtrack with composer Dan Romer. Despite a handful of flaws, including a nagging similarity to Terrence Malick's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tree-of-Life/dp/B005HV6Y5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tree of Life</a>, Zeitlin has made quite a poetic allegory that could have easily missed had he not presented Hushpuppy's world the way she sees it as an adventure marked by a tenuous search for both adventure and purpose.",1358121600,,2707,5.665024630541872

To see a beautiful little girl and her friends being ignored, abandoned, and mistreated by the adults who are supposed to care for them?  No matter how badly she is mistreated by her drunken father, adorable, little Hushpuppy loves her daddy. If watching people drink themselves to oblivion, abuse children, choosing to live in abject poverty and squalor is something that you find entertaining, then you just might find this depressing film entertaining. Even if using the excuse that all the people depicted in the film are mentally ill, it is a heart wrenching view of the effect on children of choosing that lifestyle. Being poor does not have to mean living the way shown in this film. The father finds the means to always have alcohol readily available, but the child is shown eating cat food. Toward the end of the movie she says she remembers being picked up and held twice in her life.  That to me sums up the entire overwhelming sadness of the movie.",1358035200,2,1213,4.712264150943396

5123159,5,B008220AGC,"Beasts is without a doubt the best movie of 2012.

Unlike Django Unchained, Beasts of the Southern Wild, features an interracial cast in a richly textured, honorable and mesmerizing masterpiece. Quvenzhane Wallis is a force of nature, as Hushpuppy, a little girl growing up without her mother in a close knit community called The Bathtub, an island off the Louisiana coast. Her strong willed father played fiercely by Dwight Henry is training Hushpuppy to be fearless and resourceful in the Wild and in life as he faces his looming demise.
The plot is simple and it is Quvenzhane Wallis who carries the film from the ordinary to the extraordinary. She is in every scene, as well as speaks the haunting voiceover. Hers is breathtaking performance, and the fact she was only 6 years old during filming makes her portrayal even more remarkable.  Wallis deserves all the accolades she is receiving and I believe she will nab the Oscar too. The musical score is earthy and emotional and the cinematography is lush and inviting.

Of course I would have rather seen this movie on the big screen,  but watching the Amazon instant video on my laptop was intimate and satisfying. I feel so lucky to have experienced this film and I highly recommend.",1358035200,2,1239,4.830188679245283

After all the buzz surrounding this film, I was ready to be wowed.  Then I read an amazon review that called this a wonderful movie to watch with your kids.  So I did, with much anticipation, fire this up for an evening at home with my offspring, expecting us both to be moved.

You know, I'm sure, the tale of the Emperor Who Had No Clothes.  The sycophants in his kingdom all raved about his wondrous garments.  A child in the crowd cried out that the Emperor was butt naked, and suddenly the tide turned.

I doubt my little review will turn this tide - once the media machine is cranked up, no amount of truth telling is able to dial it down again, at least not until the fad has subsided and the parade is receding into the darker corners of cultural memory.  Susan Hayward in ""Smash Up"" - chewing up the sets and bouncing off the walls won her an Oscar nomination many moons ago.  It now looks pretty darned lame.  It WAS pretty darned lame.

Here's the truth from my perspective - and out of the mouths of babes - including my reasonably unspoiled and perceptive twelve year old daughter.  This is a horrible little movie. Perhaps in La La Land, where the sun shines all day and the movie industry lives in a bubble of pumped up ta tas and botox and Mercedes convertibles, this mess passes for a ""revelation.""  Yes, now I see, there are poor people in the world. Imagine that!  However, jumpy hand held cinematography depicting a drunken father who whacks his young child around the way some folks kick their dog, that ain't heartwarming, informative or revelatory.  A six year old who gets ticked off and decides to torch the squalid trailer in which she lives - alone, because her father won't live in the same space with her.  Her teacher, who exhorts a classroom full of tots not to 'act like a bunch of pussies.'  No, not really my idea of a good time, or an education, or whatever it is supposed to convey.  A baby race, with muddy infants with numbers in magic marker on their diapers crawling through muck to the finish line, while drunken buffoons urge them on -- what's this, a new form of dog racing, or cock fighting?  Now cut back and forth to footage of melting glaciers, sunsets, refineries in the distance.  Ooooh.  Symbolism.  Sly socio-political commentary. Sure, if you're a sophomoric 15 year old who hasn't spent much time outside of Brentwood.

This parade will have to march on by without me, or my daughter.  She pronounced this movie frightening and pointless.  I am inclined to agree.  I will admit, we could not bear to watch to the end.  Perhaps we missed the epiphany, the boffo finish.  Maybe it's like turning off Seven Samurai before the conclusion.  If so, then mea culpa.  I'm a guy with an open mind, and I will probably take 90 minutes out of my life again one evening, sit down by myself and watch this film intently, from start to bitter end.  If it changes my mind, I will change my review.

But I'll tell you what my daughter and I did, as we tried to get our appetites and enthusiasm back so we could enjoy a movie and a big bowl of popcorn with lemon beurre blanc -- we watched Ratatouille.  Sure, it's big budget, big studio animation.  It doesn't have the Sundance/Indie cred.  But it certainly has a lot more depth, wit, charm and slyly intelligent things to say about what it means to be human -- and hell, the main characters are mostly rodents.",1357948800,6,3690,4.546282245827011

5123167,4,B008220AGC,"Watching or rather experiencing BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD is `like looking in on another universe through a keyhole.' The film is visual poetry, illuminating a unique corner of the world and making it a mystical magic message. It could not come at a better time when all the media is FINALLY paying attention to the fact that we are destroying our planet and that we may be closer to the last days of life as we know it than we even imagine. But before this film was made there was a play by Lucy Alibar called JUICY AND DELICIOUS about a boy in Georgia who feels like the whole world is collapsing as his father is dying. Alibar and director Benh Zeitlin adapted the play to a screenplay, carrying through the same themes of loss and strength, all set in a mythical world that's as brutal as it is beautiful: it is now related through the eyes of a small girl in Bathtub, Louisiana and is about people having the courage to love and defend the people and place they call home.

Hushpuppy (Quvenzhan Wallis), an undauntable six-year-old girl, lives with her father, Wink (Dwight Henry), in the Bathtub, a southern Delta community at the edge of the world. Wink's tough love prepares her for the unraveling of the universe; for a time when he's no longer there to protect her. Real-world villains (terminal illness, indifferent authorities) and folkloric foes (an apocalyptic storm, a rampaging herd of mytho-prehistoric creatures or aurochs) prove no match for Hushpuppy, Wink, and a ragtag bunch of bayou dwellers. When Wink contracts a mysterious illness, nature flies out of whack, temperatures rise, and the ice caps melt, unleashing an army of prehistoric creatures called aurochs. With the waters rising, the aurochs coming, and hot-tempered Wink's fading health fading, Hushpuppy goes in search of her lost mother, learning the ways of the 'civilized world' beyond the intrepid levees and learns the way of courage and love.

While most of the talk about this film is about the performance of Quvenzhan Wallis as Hushpuppy, though most of her `acting' is reading lines off screen with only a few moments of actually interacting with the visual story an the characters about her, The true magic of the film lie in the brilliant metaphors of the script: that is what makes this film important. Yes, the story as it unfolds before our eyes is unique and touching  and Director Zeitlin has managed to gain authoritative performances form an untrained cast (too little is written about the extraordinary performances by Dwight Henry (a pastry shop owner) and Gina Montana as Miss Bathsheba and the other actors who give the story credence by their simple honesty.  Does Quvenzhan Wallis deserve an Academy Award for this first venture by a child in a film in which she is only a part of the mission? No more so than nominating the cast as an ensemble effort.  But instead of concentrating on `the youngest actor to ever be nominated for an Oscar', best to approach this film as a prediction, more than an omen.  And for that reason it deserves high praise.

5123175,4,B008220AGC,"See this film, if only to savor the performance of the remarkable Quvenzhan Wallis. As a critic I greatly respect says, nominating her for an Academy Award, while predictable, is inappropriate because in most ways she was not acting. She was being her own single-minded 6-year-old girl and doing it extremely well. It remains to be seen if she is an ""actor"" actor.

The story line of the film is not particularly unusual, but the context and location of the film are quite out of the ordinary. It takes place in ""The Bathtub,"" a large artificial bayou of near-stagnant water locked behind a levee. The place is barely inhabitable to start with, but a Katrina-like storm destroys whatever is viable in the Bathtub and drains it, creating conditions of impassable mud and fetid pools. Some of the inhabitants decide on a solution that compounds the disaster and places them in the sights of state welfare agencies and state ""benevolence"" that the survivors cannot abide. In the end the little girl must face down multiple inevitabilities and dangers, something she does with great fortitude.

I haven't mentioned the wild boars. And I won't., other than to say that they gallop through the movie until they meet an indomitable mastery.

5123200,4,B008220AGC,"This movie is a refreshing break from the usual formula Hollywood films, and features an unusual lead actress, Quvenzhan Wallis, who today became the youngest ever Oscar nominee for Best Actress in a Leading Role.  She plays Hushpuppy, a young girl living in ""The Bathtub"", which appears on a map as an island just south of mainland Louisiana, and is a community living on the fringe.

Hushpuppy's mom is gone, and her Dad, who is well meaning, doesn't quite cut it as a parent.  What he DOES excel at, though, is teaching Hushpuppy to become independent and able to take care of herself - mostly.

I liked the first two thirds of the movie the best.  Events in the plot caused things to move into high gear about 2/3 of the way through, as is common, and I found the last third far less satisfying, because it played as if the filmmakers had run out of time and money, and had to rush it to its conclusion.

It is not a perfect movie, but I am rating it four stars which on Amazon means ""I Like It"".  Seeing it once was enough for me, one reason I would not call it five stars (""I Love It"").

The actress, who was in kindergarten when she was cast, and with no prior acting experience, delivers a quietly stunning performance.  She portrays Hushpuppy, a strong-willed ""wild child"" living in a bayou in squalid conditions with minimal supervision and little affection from her alcoholic father.  Her mother has abandoned them. Her father has a terminal illness and is determined to teach Hushpuppy how to survive without him.  At the same time, her world is torn apart by a tropical storm that swamps their isolated community on the wrong side of the levee, followed by the forced evacuation of its close-knit residents.  Hushpuppy's vulnerability is heartbreaking.  She has developed her own philosophy to deal with a world she struggles to understand.  The beasts of her imagination become a metaphor for her fears.  I love the score, and I am astonished that this young director got this level of performance from a cast with no prior acting experience, particularly his tiny star.  The film, which feels more like a documentary, is gritty and probably too intense for younger children.  It is not a ""pretty"" film.  I've seen ""pretty"" films that were pretty ordinary and pretty forgettable.  I will not forget this one.  I look for the young actress to be nominated for an Academy Award.

The basic plot is well detailed by the descriptions and summaries found on the Web as well as here on Amazon. Nothing particularly new there. What makes this movie good and interesting is the execution, the rawness of the emotions, the fantastical elements, the overall atmosphere that arrives in your brain like regular pulses of morning mist that just can't be burned away by the sun because it wants to keep playing with the sunlight instead.

5123274,5,B008220AGC,"I think those who dismiss this film as another film about poverty are missing the point.  This film demonstrates that one can be happy and strong despite living in less than ideal surroundings.  The film focuses on a six year old girl, Hushpuppy(Quvenzhane Wallis) who lives in a ramshackle shack with her father on an island in the Louisiana gulf called the Bathtub.  It isn't really explained but Hushpuppy's mother is absent and her father (Dwight Henry), though hardworking, likes to tip the bottle.  This requires resilliance and strong intestinal fortitude for Hushpuppy to perservere and she is up to the challenge.  A hurricane hits the region putting the residents of the Bathtub in chaos and Hushpuppy is forced to dip even further into her reserve but also tend to her sick father.  ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" is a wonderful film with a central performance by Wallis that is monumental not just for her tender age but for an actress of any age.  The Oscar nominations are coming out shortly and it would be criminal if Wallis isn't nominated.  An associate who is a member of the Screen Actor's Guild said she might not be nominated because she isn't a member of the Guild.

5123315,3,B008220AGC,"Beasts of the Southern Wild shows us what happens to the isolated rundown community called the Bathtub, which sits precariously in the waters off New Orleans. Society has pretty much forgotten the area and its inhabitants, who live in slum-like shacks, appear never to wash and also drink far too much. Right away we have the first challenge for the director: these folk are not particularly attractive or interesting. Why should we care what happens to them? We see most of the action through the ideas of six-year-old Hushpuppy, who lives in squalor with her increasingly sick father. She is for some reason fascinated by the giant and extinct auroch, a cow-like beast which lived in prehistoric times and an animal she associates with great and unpleasant changes.

  Talking of which ... a great Katrina-like storm pounds the area and the flood waters start to rise. In desperation Hushpuppy and her father set off in their ramshackle boat and look for other survivors. It's at this moment the movie slips off into a state bordering on incoherence. Even though we're clearly watching a fable-cum-fantasy, it still has to obey the basic rules of film-making, one of which is ""Try to make sense at least some of the time"". A stuffed crocodile packed with dynamite makes an appearance, and then a crazy man on an even more ramshackle boat takes Hushpuppy and a few young pals to a bizarre dance club where scantily-dressed women pirouette with the kids. Fellini might have got away with this but that's because he was Fellini. Handled by another lesser director, it only serves to irritate and confuse.

  The authorities intervene and take the Bathtub's survivors to a high-school cum hospital, where they feel miserable and soon manage to escape. By now the film is really making little sense and we are not helped when the aurochs make an appearance. The aurochs were cows, yet the film maker uses dressed up Vietnamese pigs instead, and this adds to the confusion. Pigs are not cows, people. This film was a disappointment. Yes, I know it's meant to be an allegory and a fantasy, but even so, it needed a better script and a more interesting set of characters.",1357171200,8,2165,4.822102425876011

The non-actor cast was totally remarkable, especially Quvenzhane Wallis who was only 5 1/2, 6 years old when the movie was filmed.

A poor child lives with angry, stupid and lazy people who live their life as a party all of the time and put their lives and those of their children in jeopardy because of squalid living conditions. The predictable storm occurs, they get rescued then escape... just to live in the mud again. The metaphorical beasts rush towards the girl, then Kneel? For what?

5123392,5,B008220AGC,"This movie invites the viewer to dig deep, but you can also just sit back and enjoy it!

This gorgeous film is about a hero who must cross over an enchanted landscape inhabited by monsters in order to find herself. There are constant nods to Greek mythology, from the neighbor named Achilles, to the Elysian Fields were the young child is briefly reunited with her mother. This time Persephone herself is the seeker. Her Odyssey includes witches, Sirens, bachanals, shipwrecks, faithful fellowship. Libations are poured, supernatural beings are summonsed---it's all there in a uniquely American setting.

Zeitlin has done his homework not just in the classics, but also in the local history of Terrebonne Parish, which includes isolated fishing villages that are so off the grid they didn't have any roads up until the 1940's. There are elderly Native Americans living on tribal lands there today who do not speak English. The children did not enter public schools until 1964. Before then, they attended mission schools, which could have been just as strange and folkloric as the school depicted in The Bathtub, the community of stubborn outsiders where the film is set.

While the film is considered to be a work of magical realism, there is a lot of recognizable truth to the independence, material conditions, and most importantly, the resourcefulness of the characters who live in The Bathtub. The local Houma tribe---not yet Federally recognized---having never been displaced from the region, could very well retain much of the Shamanism that colors this film.

Middle class city folk have expressed horror over the squalor of The Bathtub, but they are missing the point that poverty can look different from the inside, and that having a sense of independence, ownership, and freedom outside of the cash economy can make a person feel richer than being marginalized as a minimum-wage worker struggling to cover rent. Poor people have survived for centuries on their own terms, and while it's hard to believe that there are people in America who eschew modernity for a medieval lifestyle---by that I mean one that does not include modern medical interventions, the concept of alcoholism, plumbing, etc.---ask anyone from Maine, New Mexico, or other states where there are still isolated ancient communities, and they will know of people whose lives resemble The Bathtub one or two generations ago, or even now.

The young director/screenwriter/composer of this film is a talented Renaissance Man who has managed to attract an ensemble of equals to work with him. Zeitlin will be the Orson Welles of his generation. This film has too many layers to discuss in a short review. Most first time film-makers and novelists try to cram all of their ideas into their first work, and Zeitlin is no exception, but he managed to pull it off, probably because he had an experienced, highly skilled editor in Affonso Goncalves, who also edited Winter's Bone.",1356825600,3,2949,5.0847107438016526

What struck me above all was the ability to portray another ""lifestyle"" with sensitivity and dignity, never judging or inflicting ethno-centricity into the mix.  There is a poignant scene where Hush Puppy is ""rescued"" and sent to an evacuation center and school, allegedly in a ""civilized"" environment...you can truly feel the oppressiveness and sterility, and are enormously relieved when she ""escapes"" to return to her ""real"" life.

The same holds true for depiction of family.  At first, you find yourself being critical of the father, but as time goes by, you begin to understand that simply because it isn't ""our"" norm doesn't mean it is wrong or bad.  If movies could be made to give us a clearer understanding of each others' differences and teach us acceptance and tolerance, we might just begin to have a truly more civilized world.

I should also add that the visuals in this movie are outstanding, and the acting is amazing, especially considering that these weren't Hollywood regulars.

5123404,3,B008220AGC,"I do totally understand why people found this movie poetic and engaging.  It's a pathetic, plotless saga of very sad and likely unredeemable lives.  I just didn't get why it was particularly ""cohesive.""  Where do these people, who appear chronically unemployed, get the money to stay preposterously drunk all the time?  I don't get the acceptance of child abuse.  Sorry.  I'll watch it again, because you all love it.  Seriously, though, nothing for a moment cuts through the gloom, and even in Shakespeare's darkest tragedies, he incorporated some wit and a contrapuntal moment of comic relief.  Drunk people lying unconscious on the pissed out rotting floors of their shacks does not constitute humor, at least in my book.  I'll take another look, I promise.

But days after having some really bad nightmares inspired by the drunk squalid setting, I'm still not convinced it's a good movie.  Metaphors, what metaphors?  Are the beasts representative of an oppressive society that looks down upon alcoholic child abusers?  Is the little girl somehow emblematic of the ""human spirit because she sets fire to her miserable shack?""  Is the father the Ulysses of Shrimp?  Does the levee represent the border between ""free life"" society, and the horrible existence of a clean hospital that tries to save these sick pathetic creatures?

5123405,5,B008220AGC,"I had read reviews of this film since it first appeared in theaters (summer, 2012).  But I didn't get a chance to see it until Thanksgiving when we watched it at home on streaming video.  When I asked my friends and family none of them had seen it (released mainly to ""art"" theaters) or had even heard of it.  I knew then what I was giving as Christmas presents: DVD's of ""Beasts.""

""Beasts"" is a fairy tale for our time, and little Hush Puppy is its brave heroine.  Six-year-old Quvenzhane Wallis is totally believable as Hush Puppy, her very first acting role.  Similarly, newcomer Dwight Henry is perfectly cast as Hush Puppy's father Wink.  And first-time director Benh Zeitlin, who also co-wrote and co-scored the movie, is another ""natural"" to help bring to life this American fairy tale. His parents are both folk-lorists, he's been making home movies since he was six, and he lived through the devastation of hurricane Katrina while residing in New Orleans.  Plus, Zeitlin wisely reworked the script in places to make the dialog of Wallis and Henry conform more closely to their own idiomatic preferences.

The Oscar buzz is on for ""Beasts.""  But there is also resistance:  Zeitlin not a ""Hollywood"" director; actors not members of SAG, Wallis ""too young"" to be nominated for best actress.  We'll know the first results on Jan 10, 2013 when Oscar nominations are announced.  Regardless of how the politics of awards play out, those who have seen ""Beasts"" will not question its emotional impact or deny that they were totally captivated by the soon-to-be legendary performance of Wallis as Hush Puppy.

Still, she is scrappy enough to weather the storm, literally, and later on to deal with something a bit closer to home.  She must face the beasts--her fears--in order to go on, even with her innate resiliency.

5123429,4,B008220AGC,"The opening scene of Beasts of the Southern Wild is one of the best I've seen lately. Immediately we're introduced to Hushpuppy (Quvenzhan Wallis), a curious and adventurous 6 year old who plays with animals around her shack within a bayou community. Her father, Wink (Dwight Henry) yells ""Put your pants on man!"" to her, and soon after calling her in for ""feed up time."" Later on the whole community takes part in a party full of music, grub, and fireworks. It's a strange yet beautiful opening scene that shows a different world, but one that we suddenly want to know more about.

The rustic and fascinating community is soon shaken up as a giant storm threatens their livelihoods. Having seen Katrina, and more recently Sandy, the storm as well as the theories for its cause, is all too familiar to today's society. The writers put a unique spin on the tragedy however, most notably the arrival of aurochs (ancient giant cattle) who begin to emerge after the melting ice caps come crashing down with the storm.

As if the storm wasn't enough, Hushpuppy comes to the realization that her father has become quite ill. This forces her to become ""the man"" as her father puts it, and she does so fearlessly. The six year old, though scared of what lies ahead, takes it all head-on. Through the storm and the journey thereafter, she put through a series of events that test her strength and prepare her for the world. Through love she finds that she can handle anything.

The film had me sucked in from the get-go. The scenes were almost magical at times, while being emotional, funny, and serious all at the same time. Quvenzhan Wallis steals the show with her powerhouse performance as Hushpuppy. If you forget for a moment that you're watching a movie, you'd believe she is Hushpuppy. The supporting cast is just as fantastic and make the community seem all the more real.

I did feel, however, that the film drifted off a little towards the end. The runtime may have been a little too long for the story material, but even so there was always something interesting happening on screen. There are a few strange scenes that push the boundaries between imagination and reality that really get the viewer thinking, and there are plenty of colorful characters to observe. Then towards the ending there are some very powerful and moving scenes that bring back the same magic that the introduction brought.

Though I had the fear of losing interest during at least one point of the film, I give high praise to this film for its unique manner of storytelling and tragic yet beautiful atmosphere. I ended up loving this movie, everything from the world it depicts to its characters. The feeling a film gives you is much more important than how much it entertains you, and this film gave me a lot to feel as well as think about.

5123430,5,B008220AGC,"[Spoilers abound.]
Many who are critical of this movie are taking it as a literal story of a dirt-poor child and the questionable parenting skills of her dying, alcoholic father. But the movie's narrative and its imagery are anything but literal. The child speaks about her place in the universe, about adversity in the form of prehistoric beasts marching toward her, and about survival and acceptance in a harsh and pitiless world. It demonstrates the value of solidarity of family and community in the face of insurmountable odds. Her search for her absent mother is the not unlike the searching we all do for things that we need, but can't always get. She greets the little satisfaction she receives with gratitude, rather than with bitterness or disappointment. She accepts the death of her father with sadness, but also with the understanding that death is an inevitable part of life. She says of the prehistoric aurochs that represent her father's impending death that ""...in a way, I know that they're my friend."" If you're looking literalism and simple-minded storytelling, you're sure to be disappointed. If you're in the mood for a secular prayer to the human spirit, you might find it here.",1356652800,,1201,4.980099502487562

The acting is pure passion, honest, uncorrupt, heartfelt and strong. The child is a force of nature. It would be a crime to not get to see this child again in film. A spirit that strong is inspiring.

5123621,1,B008220AGC,"""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" is a charming story about a way of life little-known outside the bayou.  Quvenzhan Wallis as Hushpuppy gives a compelling and polished performance worthy of an actor with decades more experience (she is 6 years old).  The setting and cast are authentic; no sound stage, few if any professional actors.  Normally I would give a film of this quality five stars.

But I cannot give ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" anything above 1 star because of the incredibly poor camera work throughout the film.  Every shot -- all of them clearly done with a handheld camera -- jumps around like the worst home movie you ever were forced to sit through.  Even when the camera is not panning or the operator not moving he/she is unable to hold the shot without constant twitching and thrashing.  This ceaseless jumping became so annoying that I had to force myself to stay through to the end of the film, despite the compelling actors and setting.  I frequently closed my eyes to avoid nausea.  Many scenes were badly focused and poorly lit as well.  All in all a complete disaster from a technical standpoint, and extremely disappointing because I really wanted to love to this film.

I assume the director used this technique with some end in mind -- to show authenticity or something.  Instead he utterly destroyed what could have been a classic movie people will be watching 50 years hence.  What a waste.  This affection turned what should have been a masterpiece into a virtually unwatchable piece of trash.  The technical aspects of a film should add to, not detract from the experience.  Apparently the director was absent from film school the day that lesson was taught.",1355011200,46,1691,4.779310344827586

5123674,5,B008220AGC,"This is the first movie in which childish nightmares are no longer about nuclear holocaust but about melting icecaps - it won't be the last.  The incessantly moving hand held camera brilliantly and poetically captures a world that is sinking into watery chaos.  The movie has a post-apocalyptic feel, the world reduced to bestial squalor on one side of a levi, and overly-controlled sterility on the other.  It also feels eerily NOW, as people in Louisiana, Mississippi, New York and New Jersey can attest. Neither side of the levi is appealing, but the film comes down on the squalor side, where at least people are still passionate about nature and independence.  Complicating this sur-reality is that the story is entirely seen through the imagination of a six year old.  I don't think this movie misses a beat in its gut-wrenching, tragic, and ultimately uplifting take on a child's view of the apocalypse.  When little Hushpuppy as narrator says that scientists of the future will know that ""Once there was a Hushpuppy, and she lived with her daddy in the Bathtub,"" she seems to realize that she and her kind are approaching extinction, like the feared prehistoric Auroxes of her waking nightmare who are frozen in the icecaps and come back to life to eat her when the poles melt.

5123687,4,B008220AGC,"Beasts of the Southern Wild is an eccentric, non-linear tale which is hard to fathom but is held together by utterly absorbing performances from its two leads, most notably six year old Quvenzhan Wallis who gives a striking, powerful and heart warming performance reminiscent of Anna Paquin's Flora in The Piano. That earned Paquin (then 11) a best supporting actress Oscar: Wallis is 6, and a leading role, and Beasts is sufficiently unconventional a picture that that would be expecting a bit much here, but nevertheless mark it that, how little else you get out of this film, the relationship between Hushpuppy (Wallis) and her Dad Wink (Dwight Henry, also a first-time actor) is a remarkable and wondrous thing. Quvenzhan Wallis is, as Roger Ebert puts it, simply a force of nature.

Hushpuppy's mother is gone: Wink says she swam away. Hushpuppy expects her back sometime. Until that day, she and Wink live in a pair of ramshackle sheds - one each - connected by a cowbell on a rope, filled with totems and items from their lives. These sheds are somewhere between shantytown shacks and found object assemblages, and I believe are among the pieces credited as artworks of Elizabeth Behl, a New York sculptor credited as ""Scenic Artist""). All reside together with a rag tag collection of other oddballs the won't side of the levee on a fictional island on a fictional bayou, but it's a lot like Louisiana and the gathering storm - foretold by Wink - is a lot like Hurricane Katrina. Before it arrives we revel in the madcap, but vibrant, life all live within the ""Bathtub"", disconnected from the Grid and set free of the corporate constraints of the rest of the planet, glumly symbolised by a giant energy plant hulking in the distance beyond the levee.

Hushpuppy has a vivid imagination - or perhaps is a swamp sprite - and battles doggedly with the disrupting forces in her life, which also happen to be the stabilising ones. Her mother is gone and her father ails, from we know not what, but is preparing hushpuppy for a time where he isn't there. We have no doubt she's ready for it. She imagines the arrival of the ""aurochs"", mythical beasts which draw ever nearer and threaten calamity.

Calamities arrive in the shape of the Hurricane, which floods the bathtub and lays waste to much of the locals' life, but doesn't seem unduly to bother them, and in the deterioration of her Wink's health. Hushpuppy scans the horizon for signs of her mother, and in the winking light of a distant lighthouse, sees one. If mum won't swim back, Hushpuppy will swim out to her. So she does.

There are large stretches of Beasts of the Southern Wild which didn't seem to have an obvious purpose: it felt rather like a assemblage of collected footage rather than a linear composition of deliberately shot and acted passages which the director aimed to capture in the first place. This didn't awfully matter as long as the relationship between Wink and Hushpuppy was progressing, and Wallis and Henry were sufficiently captivating that was never in doubt.

This is a remarkable, unforgettable piece of film making.

5123688,5,B008220AGC,"I am a coonass.  I am from Southwest Louisiana and am a part of the joie de vivre culture of South Louisiana.  This world has embraced me and rolled up in its cocoon of love of place, of family, of celebration all my life.  Beasts of the Southern Wild comes the closest of any movie I have ever seen to expressing the truth of the sheer beauty of life in the swamps.  Through the devastation of hurricanes, the opression of the wealthy, and the well-meaning of outsiders, we survive.  And yet our world is dying.  We know it as surely as we can see the trees dying on the marshes as the salt water moves further inland, because our buffers are dissappearing.  We know it when we drive the roads and watch the waves lap against our tires or roar against the sides of our cars.  We know it when we fish and see the open water where once there was land.

This movie, better than any other, cherishes these truths and films them.  I'm grateful that Zeitlan chose not to embrace Cajuns in this movie, because that aspect of our culture has become so commercialized and is so foreign that all people pay attention to when given that in a film are the quaint accents.  He chose a creole culture (that does exist more or less) in a place (that also does exist, more or less) and gives it nickname that expresses many of our worst fears about what can happen to cherished lands after a bad flood and storm due to the levee system that was designed, in many cases, to protect some interests only.

Many of the aspects of this movie were drawn from real-life.  Levees have been blown up in the past to the decimation of entire creole cultures.  Hurricanes come with regularity and destroy much; ome people do not have resources or the ability to leave and some stay out of sheer cussedness.  Thanks to coastal erosion, our world is disappearing and will be gone one day into the warm waters of the Gulf.

And yet Zeitlan could not end it there.  He tells a story of destruction and death, but one in which children lose all and yet grow up and contain the magic inside them and take the strength of their miraculous orgins with them and can rebuild.

This movie captures who we are, in all our squalor and all our glory and all the uniqueness of the many shifting ethnic and cultural groups that make up this place and this time and make us unique and it captures why it is so heartrending that one day, perhaps not in my lifetime, but perhaps in Wallis's, it will all be gone and only our land's children will be left to bring the strength of this place with them.",1350864000,684,2554,4.341052631578948
5123689,3,B008220AGC,"After watching the trailer for this movie, I was really excited to see it, and I had also heard it was really good. So I was disappointed when not only was the camera too shaky (didn't make me feel sick or anything, but it annoyed me), but the story was so bizarre that it left something to be desired. During the movie I found myself more than once looking at my watch, and afterward, my friend and I stayed through the end of the credits and left the theatre with no discussion of the film we'd just watched. Later (the next day!) we talked about it, and both agreed it was just too ""weird"". Weird is fine, in terms of quirky, and odd. But it's hard to know what the message, the ""point"" of this movie was....and one thing bothers me more deeply:

 I have heard that these actors are real locals of the general area. But the people who  lived in ""The Bathtub"", in this movie's story, seemed so stubborn as to not only border on, but cross into, stupidity. They were stereotyped as alcoholics and dumb people. If you were from that locale, wouldn't you want to represent the people of your region in a more positive light? I don't know; but somebody else brought up this point and I think it is terrific.

On the other hand, the acting really was terrific. Wallis, the girl who plays Hushpuppy (the heroine of the movie), is truly a fantastic actor, with a wide range of emotions that she portrays well. The actor who plays her father does a great job as well, showing himself in different lights.

The first review of this that I saw on Amazon mentioned ""another"" great film of 2012: Moonrise Kingdom. I have to say that I saw ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" first, and after that very odd and not-so-great experience, I was wary to watch another ""indie"" film (Moonrise Kingdom) so soon after. I know this is a page about ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"", not ""Moonrise Kingdom"", but suffice it to say that Moonrise Kingdom achieves the quirkiness and oddities of situations and characters, which Beasts of the Southern Wild fails to do.",1350432000,7,2034,4.471698113207547

Sometimes the food scenes were just reviling, other times the director seemed to take pleasure in submitting the audience to up-close food-related cruelties that appear to be happening to actual living things. I did not stay to the end of the credits but I am reasonably sure that the array of life forms scooped up out of the murky water for dinner were real.  Other than that, prepare for a grim, claustrophic visual domain, a glum plot and unlikeable characters. The kids were good, yes, adorable, but the in-your-face, depravity slice-of-life angle was too far over the top to appreciate.",1347840000,7,758,4.9140625

5123692,5,B008220AGC,"I walked out of the theater Sunday completely awed. My eyes were swollen from the crying, my neck was sticky from the tears. I could even feel the color in my face separating into blotchy red and white patches. As a rule, I don't cry in public. The effect is just too humiliating. So if you look over in the theater and I'm unashamedly weeping, you know I have been absolutely emotionally compromised. I suspected Beasts of the Southern Wild (Benh Zeitlin, 2012) would be moving, but this... This was unearthing.

Winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, Beasts of the Southern Wild is director Benh Zeitlin's first feature film and Quvenzhan Wallis's acting debut. The film's plot is best summarized in Hushpuppy's (Wallis) own words at the end of the film: ""...once there was a Hushpuppy, and she lived with her daddy in the Bathtub."" The Bathtub, whose exact location is never clearly established, is a poverty-stricken rural area with a very tight-knit community. When a storm floods the Bathtub, Hushpuppy and those around her must find a way to survive, all whilst being chased by aurochs (which look like very large half-pigs-half-cows).

While the film was well-received by critics, I want to know why everyone isn't talking about this movie. Poetic, raw, magical... This film blew me away. All too-often the box office is flooded with either fluffy feel-good movies or depressing angst films that send viewers spiraling into an oblivion of darkness. Good films--the best films--can reach down into the tragedy of our existence, accurately portray the violence of our world, and rise from the pit with hope. Beasts is one of these films, waking and shaking you in your very bones.

Wallis's performance topped anything I've ever seen from anyone, let alone a five-year-old. If ""heartwarming"" wasn't one of the most overused words slapped onto movie covers, I'd use it now. From her first scene, Wallis has you wrapped around her little finger, drawing you in to her character's fierceness through the most beautifully delivered lines and powerful facial expressions to reach the screen in, well, ever.

The film itself was a visual stunner. Zeitlin's ability to use imagery instead of dialogue is masterful. His cinematography is breathtaking. What Terrence Malick attempts to do in Tree of Life (2011) with extensive scenes of cosmic glory, Zeitlin does seamlessly with sometimes-beautiful-sometimes-grotesque shots of life in the Bathtub.

And let's not forget the fantastic score, which somehow takes instrumental folk music and transforms it into a thing of inspiration. It was Mumford & Sons minus the lyrics plus all the emotional pull of any James Horner movie score. And it was composed by none other than the film's director, Benh Zeitlin, along with Dan Romer.

Beasts was flawless. Flawless, I tell you. There wasn't one thing at the end of the film that I wished was different. Just be sure to take a Kleenex box with you. I wish I had.

I wouldn't be surprised if this movie wipes out the Oscars. It had all the fairy-tale magic of The Fall (Tarsem Singh, 2006) and Moonrise Kingdom (Wes Anderson, 2012), all the honesty and charm of Little Miss Sunshine (Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, 2006), and all the breathtaking cinematic effects of Tree of Life. But somehow, Beasts is still a thing of its own, a fictional story made all the more beautiful because it is true.",1346976000,43,3414,4.947643979057592
5123693,3,B008220AGC,"""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" tries not to romanticize the heroine's wild world of poverty and primal freedom. The six year old Hushpuppy lives in the Bathtub, a bayou community that lives off the grid. Trained by her father Wink to be self-sufficient, they live separately, surviving off of fish and a livestock, including chickens, goats, and pigs. The alcoholic, occasionally abusive Wink sometimes disappears for days on end, and Hushpuppy misses her long absent mother.

Still, like many children, Hushpuppy loves her father and revels in the Bathtub's independence. She is told they are better off than those in the ""civilized"" world. The jubilant opening scenes feature unconstrained revelry. These citizens would rather live and die on their own terms than submit to the regulations of modern life. The plot itself involves melting icecaps, ancient creatures, and a tremendous storm.

Quvenzhan Wallis plays the adorable, strong, and sympathetic Hushpuppy. Her performance is perhaps the film's greatest asset.  The rest of the actors are also excellent, including Dwight Henry as her father. Few films examine a messy father-daughter relationship, in which anger and love go side by side. Very few focus on characters who aren't white and upper-middle class.

There are several very funny moments and imaginative scenes of whimsy. Hushuppy's quiet yearning for a mother figure and the sense of community spirit powerfully pervade the film. Though sometimes distracting, the soundtrack conveys a sense of wonder. The beautiful environment is shot mostly with a shaky camera. (Why does destitution often call for a shaky camera?)

However, the film's loyalties ultimately lie too obviously with the poor and rough heroes. The difference between their world and that of most American moviegoers is demonstrated in a scene in which they gleefully escape from a sterile, prison-like hospital to the bright colors of the Delta. In one troubling sequence, the Bathtub dwellers blow up a levy to reset nature's equilibrium. How many people did this act kill? The film never addresses this.

The characters express a typical New Orleanian desire to expel sadness with celebration. But, as tough as their lives are, is repression really the best way to live? The idea of dying before being beholden to others is a very American ideal. But ""Beasts"" doesn't address the more dangerous, long-term aspects of isolating children from the rest of society, teaching them to fear and loathe the outside world. Hushpuppy's father has flashes of violence, but this plays into another stereotype about poverty: disadvantaged people tend to be violent.

Many viewers will either ignore or admire these undertones. This is understandable, as the movie is a coming of age tale rather than a political statement. As such, the movie is an original fantasy. But some will find the movie's messages uncomfortable and ultimately unfulfilling.",1346630400,6,2922,5.29805615550756
5123694,5,B008220AGC,"This is the best film I have seen in several years. It has immediate impact as the viewer is engaged in the life of a little African American girl in what are probably the swamplands of Louisiana. The story can certainly be taken on several levels as it reveals a rich tapestry of experiences on the edge of civilization. It is the story of little Hushpuppy and her marginally sane father. But it is the brilliance of the production that it is simultaneously the story of the end of coastal towns due to global warming and the story of little Hushpuppy facing the fear of abandonment, symbolized by giant beasts that have emerged from the thawing glaciers of the far north. The film is engaging from start to finish and is an excellent family film despite some slight sexual suggestions. The reason I recommend this film to families is that it deals with a very real fear of most children, the fear of losing parents and being alone in the world. Any parent would want to prepare their child to survive in the event of the tragic loss of a parent or a natural disaster. Hushpuppy's father is far from the ideal father but he does the best he can, which in the end is all we can ask of any parent. I loved the film.",1346198400,4,1214,4.376106194690266

5123696,2,B008220AGC,"Publicity for this movie set my expectations in completely the wrong way. I found one part accurate: the little girl in the leading ""Hushpuppy"" role is incredibly cute, and carries herself with all the solemnity of a child trying to understand the grown-up world and find her place in it. Her presence was the only thing I actually liked about this movie.

Outside of that, I found it a believable but stomach-turning study in the deepest kind of American poverty, a culture where failure is not only the norm, but is all that anyone in it is worth. Fantasy elements did enter, but only rarely and did little to change affect the main themes. They seemed to consist mainly of huge boars (the biggest animal Hushpuppy knew anything about), with horns borrowed from aurochs, which had been painted by a teacher as terrible threats to early man. They neither rose above the general squalor of ""The Baththub,"" nor exceeded the actual ruin caused by Hurricane Katrina.

Perhaps there was something good in this movie, beyond child actor Quvenzhan Wallis's role. If so, it eluded me.

5123697,3,B008220AGC,"I have the same general complaint for the excess shaky-cam use.  I though many of the close-ups were a bit too close, especially with shaking.  While it was apparent it was hand-held, it was shakier than most home videos, so I assume they were intentionally shaking it. (my wife had to leave the theater for a while, feeling sick.)  I guess they were trying to add a sense of being there yourself (while jumping around chaotically), but even some scenes where the subjects are calm still have a jumping camera. I don't quite get what affect this is supposed to add.  Fortunately, this seemed to occur less later in the film (or did I get used to it).  I really think that it would have been better to keep moving shots a bit more fluid and less jumpy (with a nice stead-cam set-up) even when running along with the people, and calm shots would have been better completely still (Tripod anyone?).

Other than that, I did enjoy the story, and the world breaking from the little girls perspective and imagination (thinking she was somehow part of her father breaking), while she tries to ""fix"" it as best a small girl can.  The bathtub is certainly a strange world for most of us on the dry side of the levee, but the message transcends many walks of life, and there may come a time when anyone may need to become a beast to push through the hard times.
(From some other reviews, it looks like some people may have not grasped that much of the fantastical aspects are from the mind of the little girl, from imagery that she formed from her teacher's stories.  Just keep in mind that the story is primarily from the perspective of a 6 year-old girl in dual crises (her father and the storm)).

I probably would have given at least a 4 star if not for shaky-cam style used for filming.",1344816000,11,1780,4.435582822085889
5123698,4,B008220AGC,"""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" (92 min.) brings the tale of a wide-eyed 6 yr. old girl called Hushpuppy (played by then 5 yr. old Quvenzhan&eacute; Wallis) and her dad (played by Dwight Henry), in a place called the ""Bathtub"", some forsaken area near New Orleans. Their fragile existence is uprooted by a flood, which makes their place uninhabitable. And on top of that, ""Daddy"" becomes ill. To say much more of the major plotlines would not do you any service, believe me.

Even more than that, while of course there is a major plot line going through the movie, I'm not even sure that it is all that important, as what is being presented to us is a tale of magic realism, and you have to accept certain things that show up in the story which are not explained and do not seem possible, yet create an incredible atmosphere, almost like a fairy tale.

Kudos of course to Quvenzhan&eacute; Wallis, although can a 5 yr old really act or do you just film her like she is? Even more of an eye-opener for me is the performance by Dwight Henry, also in his first starring role. What a talent! Sign that guy up for more acting roles, pronto! This movie is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare, so if you are in the mood for something bland and mainstream, I would not recommend this to you. If on the other hand you are into quality indie movies, by all means, do not miss this! One of the best of the year, period.",1344124800,18,1415,4.356060606060606
5123699,5,B008220AGC,"This film defies my standard approach repertoir to watching and reviewing movies.
It has a cute main actress but it is far from being a cute film.
It has very little plot but never bores. The handheld camera made my daughter seasick, though.
It has fantasy elements but it is shockingly realistic.
It has elements of naturalistic criticism of society, but it has no message, least of all solutions for the problems it shows.
It is implicitly critical of a part of American society, but the basic attitude is defiantly individualistic and thus American.
It is set in the most dysfunctional family, but it is fiercely family oriented.
It seems to despise the alcoholic wasted population of the bathtub, but it stays loyal to them till the end.

I need to compare films to other films and books in order to make sense of them. This film could be compared, in a broad sense, to Irmgard Keun's book Child of All Nations, though it is not funny and it is totally not international. It could be compared to the gorgeous fantasy film The Fall, but it has no fairy tales for consolation. That book and that film both have little girls in focus, with their own views of the world. Here ends the comparison. Though both those girls are living in reduced circumstances due to their families' social situation, there is no comparison to Hushpuppy's misery.

The Bathtub is a slum area outside New Orleans. Hushpuppy lives there in a shack with her sick father. Katrina comes and the world as Hushpuppy knew it goes under water. Not that that world was much to grieve about, but we learn that everything can still get worse.
Quite possibly one can find a reactionary philosophy somewhere in here, but the film is too gripping and puzzling to bother too much with interpretation.

A final comparison: think of Winter's Bone without a plot.",1344038400,5,1824,4.69375
5123700,2,B008220AGC,"I have to say that I went into this film very much prepared to like it.  The trailer looked promising, it had gotten abundant critical praise, and had won the Camera d'Or prize at Cannes for best first film and the Grand Jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival.  Within the first five minutes though, I found myself regretting it.  So in preface I must say that my opinion is almost certainly a minority one and I would recommend reading other reviews before making a decision on whether or not to see this film.

It's very difficult to attempt to describe Beasts of the Southern Wild.  On the one hand, it has as its biggest positive a remarkable performance by newcomer Quvenzhan Wallis as Hushpuppy, the young girl who serves as the film's central character.  And there are moments in the film where you have these beautifully framed shots - usually around Hushpuppy - that give it a certain almost mystical grace.  As do the occasional moments of poetic clarity delivered in the form of Hushpuppy's inner narrative, in lines like this one:

""The whole universe depends on everything fitting together just right. If one piece busts, even the smallest piece... the whole universe will get busted.""

But then there's the rest of the film, which unfortunately consists of a rambling, chaotic and largely incoherent mess.  And therein lies my problem with Beasts of the Southern Wild.

The plot - as near as I can tell - begins with a little girl named Hushpuppy who lives with (well, next to, actually) her father, a man named Wink (Dwight Henry) who seems mentally disturbed half the time and dying the other half, as part of a sort-of community called The Bathtub which exists somewhere along the Gulf Coast, most probably Louisiana (where the film was shot) though it's never made clear.  Their home consists of two ramshackle hovels - with a small intervening space left to separate the two - seemingly made from pieces of mobile homes and vehicles apparently scavenged and salvaged from somewhere.  As does the rest of The Bathtub, whose residents seem to either lay about in a vaguely social stupor or else get agitated about someone possibly coming to move them out of their squalor and into a shelter.

Then, in what feel like random sequences, we learn that Hushpuppy has an almost mystical attachment to living things.  That her father always seems to have a plucked chicken ready to cook up that he gets from a beat-up cooler that never has any ice.  That somewhere ice-caps and glaciers (footage of same inserted) are breaking up. That sometimes her father suddenly turns up in a hospital gown with a tag on his wrist even though we never saw him leave, never saw the hospital he went to or how he got there and back.  That Hushpuppy for some reason starts a fire that burns up her residence.  Oh, and that it starts raining and the water suddenly starts to flood the area, though whether this is because of the rain, or the melting ice, or a levee that exists nearby is never made clear.  Nor is it made clear why suddenly there are these creatures called aurochs - think giant hairy hogs with elephant tusks sticking out of their mouths and foreheads - wandering around.

Is it set in the present or the future?  I don't know.  Is it fantasy? Science-fiction? Magical realism?  An ecological cautionary parable?  I don't know.  Does Hushpuppy get reunited with her mother?  Do we even figure out who her mother is?  I don't know.  Does anything that happened in this film have any point or make any sense at all?  Sadly, I do not know.

I did say ""rambling, chaotic and largely incoherent"", yes?  It's like there were two vastly different people involved in making this movie.  One - the one who came up with the occasional beautifully-framed shots and Hushpuppy's moments of inner narrative - who knew what they were doing.  And one - the one responsible for the rest of the film - who didn't.

It is probably worth noting some of the background to Beasts of the Southern Wild as it may offer some possible explanations for why the film is the way it is.  The film is director Benh Zeitlin's first feature film after having previously directed three short films.  The script was written by Zeitlin and Lucy Alibar, adapted from Alibar's one-act play Juicy and Delicious.  It is her first writing credit.  (Note: although Beasts of the Southern Wild is also the title of a short-story written by Doris Betts in the 1990's, there is no connection between that story and this one.)  The film was shot in 16mm by a professional film crew on a comparative shoestring budget of $1.8M in Louisiana with a cast of mostly locals, so it's the very definition of a small indie film.  But quite frankly, most small indie films I've seen were more coherent and better made, a prime example for contrast being Colin Trevorrow's Safety Not Guaranteed, another small indie film released at about the same time that had an even smaller budget of $750K but which I enjoyed much more.  Without knowing more of the background, the only possible explanation for the problems with Beasts of the Southern Wild seems to be the relative inexperience of the writers and director.  And almost certainly the editors, Crockett Doob and Affonso Gonalves as well.

If Beasts of the Southern Wild is worth seeing at all, it is for Quvenzhan Wallis's performance.  With a remarkably expressive face and genuine screen presence, particularly for a six or seven year-old, she is truly a natural and the camera loves her.  It would be inaccurate to say she steals every scene she's in.  Any cute child actor can do that.  Wallis _owns_ every scene she's in.  Or at least she does when the chaos isn't overwhelming the scene and the camera will stop jumping around long enough to let her.

As I said, my opinion definitely seems to be in the minority, but in all honesty I cannot recommend Beasts of the Southern Wild on its own merits.  The only reason I could recommend it would be if you're willing to put up with its serious flaws in order to see the first performance of a truly remarkable young actress who probably has great things ahead of her.",1343779200,15,6131,4.662942271880819
5123701,5,B008220AGC,"This remarkable film was shot with a first time director and a cast of amateurs that is a story in and of itself.  Benh Zeitlin directed and co-wrote, with Lucy Alibar.  They create this fantasy/drama based on Ms. Alibar's one act play called ""Juicy and Delicious.""  The movie was filmed in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana which is essentially the marshland south and west of New Orleans.  The story takes place in an area known as ""The Bathtub"" which is land surrounded by water.  These are a cluster of small islands.

They are inhabited by a hearty self-sufficient population who live off the land and the water.  Hushpuppy (Quvenzhane Wallis) is the six year old daughter of Wink (Dwight Henry).  The mother left shortly after Hushpuppy was born.  Hushpuppy stays in a trailer that was originally occupied by her mother.  Wink lives ""next door"" in his own shack.  Wink isn't a perfect father but clearly cares for his daughter.  He has a medical disorder and insists that Hushpuppy learn to provide for herself.  Wink is also a stubborn man and like most of the residents, insists on staying put rather than relocate to civilization, even with an approaching tropical storm.

Somehow this unlikely cast and crew (aided by a great score) create a believable world but add some fantastical creatures known as ""aurochs"" from the imagination of Hushpuppy.  As the storm (very realistic thanks to some nice sound work) creates havoc and a life-threatening aftermath, the small community must pull together to survive.  This terrific film was shot in 2009 when young Quvenzhane was only 5.  Her performance is exceptional as the catalyst and narrator throughout the film.  She should be on an Oscar short list.  Dwight Henry is also noteworthy as the tough love father.  The actor's real day job is a baker!  The film premiered at Sundance in January, 2012 and won the Grand Jury Prize and later 4 awards at Cannes.  ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" is an unconventional and extraordinary film.",1343174400,20,1986,4.900900900900901
5123702,5,B008220AGC,"This was the most thought provoking movie I've seen in quite some time.  Definitely a ""must see"".  The ability of this 6 year old to convey such indept feelings is amazing. We were totally enchanted with this young actress and her narration was second to none. The love and dedication the community of ""The Bathtub"" shows for one another is heartwarming.  I definitely recommend that you take not only your family and friends, but tell YOUR COMMUNITY about this wonderful and loving film.  We always wait until the movies get to the Dollar Theater, but after having read all the great reviews, thought we'd splurge and spend the $20.00 for 2 people and it was worth every penny.",1343174400,15,678,4.720338983050848
5123703,3,B008220AGC,"The main actors are very strong in the portrayal of their characters. The plot is not complicated; it's more characters drama rather than a story.

But I'm deducing stars for bad camera work and photography. Even though IMDB says 16 mm film was used, it feels like the whole movie was shot on a damn cellphone. Camera is extremely shaky, like the operator had hangover all the time. Some takes seem digitally zoomed in post-production which makes them extremely grainy. Any $1000 camcorder would have done better job.",1343001600,4,517,4.875
5123704,5,B008220AGC,"On the surface, ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" is a movie about an assortment of misfits and rejects living in ""The Bathtub"" a flood-prone outlying section of New Orleans. The film is seen through the eyes of Hushpuppy, a nine-year-old girl living with her alcoholic dad, whose heart is one the verge of giving out. The pair live in a Mad Max house trailer - a concoction of junk and scrap metal that barely holds together. Their boat is made of an old Chevy pickup bed lashed to some plastic barrels. Their neighbors are the local drunks and nuts who refuse to budge when a hurricane comes barreling down on them. This collection of fools and madmen is unsympathetic, to say the least. Being a young girl in the care of these well-meaning loons is frightening.

But the movie also operates on a deeper level that parallels the surface story. Hushpuppy has grown up without a mother, and longs for a presence other than her loving, violence-prone, sometimes-absent Dad. Her day-dreams involve her child's version of aurochs, those fabulous beasts of the Paleolithic, which she sees briefly as a tattoo on a woman's leg. The aurochs, frozen in ice, break loose and provide a visual symbol of her burgeoning need for female connection.

Truth be told, these conclusions came long after seeing the film. While watching, I was physically ill - whether due to some bad nachos, the deliberately shaky camerawork or the unending parade of unsettling food - overflowing baskets of crawdads, greasy fried gator, wriggling things in glass jars and dead animals fished out of swamps. But the mythic aspect of the film continues to fascinate. BOSW was hero's quest of mythology, transferred to the bayou. Princesses and wounded kings were projected onto Hushpuppy and her father. A distant lighthouse stood in for the siren's song, drawing the hero to wholeness. Some fried gator meat was the priceless medicine that would bring healing. The expertly imaged quest to balance the male and female aspects of the soul would have made any Jungian proud.

If you are an analytical person, you might experience the film, at first, like me - a baffling and distracting mess of bizarre, awful people. But if you see with the heart, you may get the movie right away. BOSW is a masterpiece, even if you need to undergo your own abdominal hero's journey to get through it.",1342396800,11,2348,4.8213399503722085
