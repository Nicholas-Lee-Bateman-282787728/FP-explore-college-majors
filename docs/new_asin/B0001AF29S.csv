8009229,5,B0001AF29S,"This film is a lost gem.  Marcello Mastroianni is hilarious as a rich Italian aristocrat who talks and walks with his imaginary wife.  His family thinks he is insane and try to have him committed. Lino Toffolo plays his friend who has the same likes as him, like playing classical music.  Adriano Celantano is likeable as the mobster Pimp.  I hope this film gets a proper release in its original Italian language.",1331769600,,413,4.694444444444445
