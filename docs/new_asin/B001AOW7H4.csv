8278401,5,B001AOW7H4,"Laura McKenzie's Traveler program was so well done that I had to get the DVD for myself.  I would have liked to see her do programs that featured only one place - like Prague!  This would have allowed her to venture more deeply into the location.

However, I was very favorably impressed with the program as presented.  She didn't act like a lot of ""travelers"" do.  She was totally professional and didn't waste my time.  She showed us a lot in the short time she had.  Thank you, Ms. McKenzie.  Keep up the good work - and thank you, Amazon, for having this DVD in stock and sending it to me promptly.",1414454400,,602,4.3125
