8448805,2,B004YST7PI,"I was pleased to see some of the videos of the route through Wyoming and into Utah. I traveled on the CofLA during college in the late 60s, and this brought back many memories.

That's the good part. The disappointing part is that this is just a remake of an old video with some new graphics. The narration is most often disconnected from and unrelated to the video scenes and some graphics being shown at the moment. While laying out the history of the Union Pacific, there are views of the CofLA more modern E9s and passenger cars and scenery with horrible text overlaid in a very crude fashion. So you have to detach somewhat from the video in order to follow the narration, and vice versa.

This is certainly not worth the high price that Sunday River Productions is charging. Buyer beware.",1409184000,,794,4.545454545454546
