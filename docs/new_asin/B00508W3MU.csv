4513547,2,B00508W3MU,"RATING: C-C+.  To anyone with knowledge of aviation, this movie is not an excellent movie or even an interesting movie; it is not remotely in the same league as The Bridges at To Ko Ri, The Right Stuff, Twelve O'Clock High, The High and the Mighty or Island in the Sky. The cast cannot overcome the unimaginative, unrealistic plot. It is a standard issue 1950's style movie, with a leaden dialogue and a better cast than it deserves.  It is advertised for its ""exciting"" aviation sequences, but the flying sequences are few and far between, and not exciting or even credible from either an aviation or a military perspective.",1322006400,,625,4.724770642201835
4513548,5,B00508W3MU,"I give TOWARD THE UNKNOWN five stars for its aerial photography and decent verisimilitude when it comes to Air Force aircraft of the 1950s.  For me it ranks right up there with THE HUNTERS and STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND in those qualities.  No models, such as in THE BRIDGES AT TOKO-RI (although those were excellently done), and a minimum of studio cockpits and aircraft interiors.  The sequence of an ejected pilot's parachute streaming is harrowing, and of a formation landing of a crippled jet and its chase plane on a dry lake superbly filmed.

As a drama, the movie harkens to the modern archetypal themes of military leadership from the front (and the challenges to aging professionals), exemplified by Lloyd Nolan's General Bill Banner, and being given a second chance after apparent failure under stress, posited by William Holden's portrayal of Major Lincoln Bond.  If this sounds a little like a re-working by Beirne Lay Jr. of his TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH, that's because it is, with a little of STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND thrown in, and spotting scenes, plot devices, and characters lifted from the originals is a hoot.  The tale is very much a retelling of TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH from Ben Gately's perspective rather than Gen. Savage's.  Lay updated his script, written with Gen. Frank Armstrong in mind, to reflect his admiration of USAF icons Bud Mahurin, Frank Everest, and Al Boyd.  His original partner Sy Bartlett did much the same several years later in A GATHERING OF EAGLES.

If you're an Air Force, test pilot, or jet airplane buff, well worth acquiring just for its entertainment value.",1321920000,2,1593,4.936329588014981
4513549,4,B00508W3MU,"Interesting look at the early days of Test Pilots at Edwards Airforce base in California. Done better in THE RIGHT STUFF, never the less this is a good film with a fine performance by William Holden as a flyer with a cloud over his head due to something that happenned while he was a POW in Korea.  Great scenes of flying and nice footage of early jets, the story holds water and presents it self well.  A good little picture",1320364800,,425,4.3
4513550,5,B00508W3MU,"I suppose that the decision whether or not to buy this DVD-R of Toward the Unknown depends upon how long you've wanted see this movie on home video. For me it has been decades--waiting for a VHS, a CED disc, a laser or a DVD of this terrific movie. I've got the DVD-R and it is okay. There is some color shifting during dissolves between scenes but other than that this widescreen look at Edwards Air Force Base in the middle of its golden decade is sensational. If you, like me, wonder what became of the wild blue yonder you will be delighted with this release. Don't think twice--aim high, go for it.",1317859200,35,603,4.345132743362832
4513551,5,B00508W3MU,"""Toward the Unknown,"" released on October 20, 1956, and FINALLY available on DVD, is, in my opinion as a lifelong airplane buff and recently retired aerospace engineer, simply one of the very best aviation films ever made, bar none.

A thrilling showcase of Cold-War-era jet and rocket aircraft and harrowing flight test operations, filmed on location at California's Edwards Air Force Base, it stars William Holden as Air Force Major Lincoln Bond and Lloyd Nolan as General William Banner. In the screenplay by Beirne Lay, Jr., Bond is an ex-fighter pilot who carries the stigma of having broken under the pressure of communist brainwashing while he was a POW after being shot down over Korea. The steps that he forces himself to take in order to prove to General Banner that he is fit enough to fly the supersonic rocket planes then being tested at Edwards is an interesting and absorbing tale, if a bit drawn-out dramatically.

But the aircraft are the real stars of the show, and ""Toward the Unknown"" has them in abundance, with outstanding aerial photography of planes you will not see anywhere else in filmdom. For example, this is the only place to see actual footage of the Martin XB-51 bomber in flight (disguised with fake markings as the ""Gilbert XF-120""). You'll see North American F-100 ""Super Sabres,"" Lockheed F-94 ""Starfires"" and many other classic, historic jets that were really flying at the time. One of the most significant aircraft featured at length in ""Toward the Unknown"" is the Bell X-2 rocket plane. Carried aloft by a Boeing B-50 ""Superfortress,"" the X-2 investigated flight at speeds and altitudes far beyond those of the X-1, in which Captain Charles E. ""Chuck"" Yeager first exceeded the speed of sound on October 14, 1947. There's no CGI here--these airplanes are the real thing, and they are absolutely thrilling to watch!

For about 25 years or so, I've had a videotape of ""Toward the Unknown"" that I recorded in Denver from broadcast television in Beta format (remember that?) and then transferred to a VHS tape after Beta disappeared. You can imagine the picture and sound quality. A few years ago, I bought a DVD of the show from an ""independent"" source. It's okay, but not spectacular. Now, finally, with this official Warner release, I can donate all my previous versions to the library, where, hopefully, they will inspire a new generation of aviation enthusiasts.",1311292800,63,2403,4.943069306930693
4513552,5,B00508W3MU,"TOWARD THE UNKNOWN IS ONE OF THE GREATEST FLYING MOVIES EVER MADE.  WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS MOVIE IN A THEATER ON A GIANT SCREEN IT LITERALLY BLEW ME AWAY.
  IT WAS ONE OF TWO MOVIES AT THE TIME, THAT SHOWED THE AIR FORCES WAY OF TESTING NEW HIGH ALTITUDE AIRCRAFT.  IT WAS A WELL ACTED PIECE, WITH WILLIAM HOLDEN AS A FORMER ACE TEST PILOT TRYING TO REGAIN HIS HONOR AFTER THE KOREAN WAR, BY TESTING NEW JET AIRCRAFT.  THE GENERAL PLAYED BY LLOYD NOLAN IS WONDERFUL AS THE MAN WHO GIVE HOLDEN HIS CHANCE. THE MOVIE ALSO HAS A GREAT CAST OF WELL KNOWN ACTORS, WHO SHINE IN EACH OF THERE ROLES. THERE ARE ALSO SOME GREAT ACTION SCENES OF AIRCRAFT BEING TESTED, ALONG WITH A LITTLE TRAGEDY MIXED IN.

4513559,3,B00508W3MU,"The movie itself is terrific; but the experience of watching the manufactured-on-demand DVD is seriously marred by the indoor scenes being so dark as to only reveal the human characters' faces but little else on the sound stage set.

Around 5 years ago, Warner Bros people tried to accommodate me by replacing the DVD 3 times, but all were the same poorly-lighted video quality for anything that was shot on an indoor set. So, the problem is obviously with the ""remaster"" from which WB is making copies on demand. The lighting for outdoor scenes is fine (as one might expect) except for the outdoor night scenes at the start of the film which are also too dark to show much detail. Unless you're watching a scene involving outdoor sunlight, the rest of the DVD is going to be WAY too dark.

I can only conclude that whoever supervised the transfer or ""remaster"" apparently never watched the film on VHS and never watched his or her finished product after creating the ""remaster"". I have a 20-year old incomplete VHS copy (taken off the old cable channel ""Plex"") which is very well-lighted and much more enjoyable than the DVD. Were it not for the poor lighting due to the poorly-done ""remaster"", I would easily give this film a solid 5 stars. I was hoping that Warner Bros. might eventually re-do their transfer to DVD to correct the poor lighting, but apparently that is not in the cards. Very disappointing for such an otherwise exceptionally good film.",1479859200,,1455,4.724409448818897

4513587,4,B00508W3MU,"For once I bought a movie on Amazon that lived up to the high scores on reviews.  The token love story wasn't bad and worked for this one.  Acting was excellent, especially and as usual Holden.  And per other reviewers here, the aviation footage is spectacular.  All in color.  A very important of United States pioneering aviation history preserved!

Note early on in the movie Holden walks past the X-2 and the cockpit windows design is an identical match for the helmets of Darth Vader's storm troopers of Star Wars fame.  No joke, Spielberg and Lucas clearly lifted it from this movie and used it for the helmet design. No, I'm not crazy.  Take a look!  Just like they also lifted the Star Wars I death star attack sequence cockpit crew camera shots right out of ""Mosquito Squadron"" starring Cliff Robertson.  Go on.  Take a look at that one, too.

I also think parts of ""The Right Stuff"" was also adapted from this movie.  Notice the far off crash smoke from James Garner's plane matches that seen in ""The Right Stuff"" when Yeager's F-104 crashes in the desert.  The camera angle and cinematic photography is a match.  The only thing ""The Right Stuff"" has on this flick is the advanced production capabilities brought by decades of growth in the movie-making industry.  But that's all.  I liked this movie much better.  Because of the whole ""Edwards AFB"" real looks and the real shots of the aircraft of the time, it just seems more real to me.  This movie was made when all the advances in aviation depicted in ""The Right Stuff"" were actually and simultaneously taking place.  I think this gives it a much more authentic feel as a result.

I really enjoyed this movie.  More than worth the purchase price.  As other reviewers have noted, you'll watch it multiple times for the chance to see these historic airplanes fly again.",1416528000,,1832,4.65625

I never ever, forgot this movie in all those years, it left such an impression on me ... & a remaining love for Aircraft.
It has never appeared on TV in Australia as far as I know & I have been trying to get it on DVD for years !
Now thanks to the Internet & 'Amazon', it is mine to keep & to review as much as I like.  Great Stuff !
This would be one of the first serious & sensible movies about the 'quest for speed' & to fly as high as a man could possibly fly without being an Astronaut ... the 'Sound Barrier' had already been broken a few years before by Chuck Yeager, the Race was on to pioneer the Outer Limits !  The 'flying scenes' once again are such a rare & authentic time capsule, it's a privilege to be inside the Zone.
No Digitizing or trick photography here, this really is an early version of the 'Right Stuff ' ...
Dignified acting by William Holden ( his production company produced the Film ) & an equally mature & familiar supporting Cast.
'Edwards AF Base' was ( & maybe still is ) an area of mystery, bravery & unimaginable daring, always the scene of 'things to come'.
It so vibrates with the memories of such Legends as, Glen Edwards, Joe McConnell, Chuck Yeager, Bob Hoover, Scott Crossfield, Ed White, Neil Armstrong, John Glenn & so many, many more, unassuming modern Knights of the Air.
What also strikes me as quite fascinating ... is the affect, that considering the delicacy & value of both the precious Machines & Manpower of the time & the considering the job at hand, the Crews often operated out of crude tin & slab huts in their desert environment.  The 'Budget' certainly went into the Machinery & 'Operation of ' ... not for comfort !
Pilots were quite often housed in very modest quarters & survived on just there regular pay cheques & survival mode, no frills here !  But in their eyes it was heaven next stop & wouldn't swap it for quids !  Just like Ernest Gann's very poignant Title
 'Fate is the Hunter' ... these often battle experienced Pilots from W.W.2 & Korea couldn't believe their luck, that they had arrived at their destiny, the absolute 'Cross Roads of Aviation' that occurred from 1945 to 1960'.
This quite rare & 'Airworthy' movie, attempts very nicely to interpret this period of US military aviation.
A 'Must Buy' for the enthusiast.  Enjoy !

4513605,3,B00508W3MU,"""We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex.""
-- President Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1960

If you're looking for what Eisenhower was talking about, this film might be a great place to start.

Seriously, the Air Force lent so much ""help"" to Warner Bros; and the studio's access to Edwards Air Force Base and the latest, cutting-edge aircraft of the period is so complete, that The Air Force had effectively made Warner Bros Studio their propaganda arm. As circumstantial evidence, I submit that the Air Force surely approved the script, as well as providing truckloads of technical advice, fuel, and privileged access to everything they had going on over there. The cost of the technical support may well have exceeded the cost of the film itself.

""Toward the Unknown"" is a sister film, as well, to Warner Bros' subsequent 1957 film, ""Bombers B-52"", where Warner's collaborated again with the Air Force to google over what was, at that time, America's largest mega-aircraft. The new Cinemascope was the perfect format to demonstrate to the public the awe-inspiring spectacle of America's latest WMD's.

In the throes of the Cold War, America was ready to accept the message of these films, in which aerospace technology had ascended to the status of a religion...and Sputnik hadn't even happened yet. It was a heady time for the aerospace industry, especially in Southern California. I know, because my Dad was a mathematician for Rocketdyne, and aerospace played a ""strategic"" role in the California economy.

What brought me to Toward the Unknown, however, was a burning desire to see every film Bill Holden ever made. However, for years the mysterious ""Toward The Unknown"" was tantalizingly unavailable, as it had never been released on home video. According to some sources, it was a rights issue with the Holden estate.

The film is in Warnercolor, which was an early single-strip color format film process (as opposed to three strip technicolor, the previous industry standard), so the colors do look a bit strange, mostly strong in the red and blue records. Greens don't render  well, flesh tones look a bit off, and dissolves are often loaded with blurry grain and artifacts.

However, the sound quality of this transfer is pretty good and has the feeling of mag film, not optical sound.

William Holden, as test pilot Major Lincoln Bond, is trying to fight his way back into an Air Force career after being tortured by the North Koreans. They broke him, forcing a confession that provided a propaganda bonanza for the enemy. Now Bond is fighting for his reputation and career; but luckily his boss, General Banner, lets him get his foot in the door as a test pilot.

After a series of struggles on the base, both personal and technical, Bond gradually works his way up to state-of-the-art rocket-powered aircraft. Holden fans will not be disappointed by his reserved, unassuming performance, but the script and supporting cast seem at times wooden. James Garner and Karen Steele (""Eve"" from ""Mudd's Women"") are fascinating to watch in their early roles, but Lloyd Nolan is leaden in his role as General Banner, lacking both the authority and sympathy necessary to bring the character to full fruition.

The control tower and some other scenes on the airbase were achieved with an imperfect process screen of some type, such as sodium or blue screen.

Still, it is a rare look at life on what was probably at that time America's most elite Air Force Base, where some of the most exciting research and development took place. For aerospace fans, this film is a mother lode. The aircraft have a pride of place in the story that exceeds that of the characters, if you don't mind that sort of thing. It is a showcase for America's military-industrial-aerospace complex during a unique and exploratory time in aviation history.",1381968000,,3910,4.989247311827957

It also uses actual footage of some of the exotic test aircraft and devices in use, such as the rocket sled, the ""X-planes"" and the dangers faced by test pilots. It's an historical classic and I highly recommend it for anyone interested in military aviation, especially as we transitioned to jet aircraft and into the early space age.",1380844800,2,538,4.73404255319149

4513609,3,B00508W3MU,"Unfortunately, this movie is the remastered version and IS NOT the version you might be lucky to catch on TCM late at night. Specifically, a scene where William Holden is riding in an auto on the tarmac at Edward AFB with rows and rows of C-119s in the background. For some reason it has been edited out of this remastered version. This is James Garner's first movie appearance (1956) and he is worth whatever they paid back in those days.",1376697600,,439,4.5

4513611,2,B00508W3MU,"This is a ""just in time"" production of an old movie with limited market.  They did not check the quality of the rip before they burned the DVD - the indoor scenes are very dark - only ghosts of people can be seen.  Outdoors is a bit better, you can make out the people and surroundings, but still too dark.

But I guess we were warned.  The DVD case warns that this limited production DVD can only be viewed on some types of equipment.  Not clear if the problem is a shoddy rip of the original content or the limited run DVD production.

You would be better off finding an old VHS copy - an off the air broadcast version would be easier to watch.",1370131200,4,646,4.128

What I do care for and the movie delivers big time on, is the footage of the XB-51 and the other early jets and x-planes!
What a tribute.
I have seen the movie in the past and I can tell the difference remastering made for it.
Very much recommended to US jet history aficionados.",1366243200,,330,4.171875

4513615,4,B00508W3MU,"Although this isn't a great film from the point of view of character development, or even acting performances, it has some milestone events that are important to consider ... and for me, it was an amazing experience because I had seen it in 1956 (4 times actually, and got into big trouble for leaving for the movie theatre at 10:00 a.m. and not showing up at home until 10:00 p.m. ... at the age of nine years).  I loved aviation movies then, love them now, and this one has some key scenes of '50s military aircraft hardware that I haven't seen in decades.  It's also James Garner's first movie, which makes it interesting from that viewpoint.  I'm not certain that someone who did not sit, enthralled by this heading-for-the-edge-of-space movie, during their formative years would find it as exhilarating as I did, but for anyone who is an aviation enthusiast and has an interest in the pioneers of this era, this is a very interesting film to watch.  It isn't a documentary, but it's based on enough factual data to make it a credible and enjoyable experience.",1358467200,5,1064,4.67379679144385

4513617,3,B00508W3MU,I purchased this film to see the stock footage of the Martin XB-51.  That footage was good.  The acting and plot seems to have meant as little to the cast and crew as they did to me.,1351900800,,182,3.891891891891892

4513619,4,B00508W3MU,"It's odd that TOWARD THE UNKNOWN, actor William Holden's only film as a producer, took this long to reach DVD release. But this version is worth the wait---the film's spectacular aerial photography looks great, and the extensive location filming at Edwards AFB's Flight Test Center documents that remarkable time and place in aviation. (The story-line has a hefty component of 'Hollywood' about it, but we can't totally blame screenwriter Beirne Lay Jr. It went with the territory any time a major studio made this sort of thing.) Holden plays a former POW who seeks to redeem himself as a test pilot; Lloyd Nolan plays the hard-nosed commanding general who ultimately becomes a friend. Virginia Leith plays Holden's onetime girlfriend, now the general's secretary. But the actuality of what we see onscreen---test-flights of the Bell X-2, and superb footage featuring most of the Air Force's front-line aircraft---make the whole film work. Recommended.",1340409600,,953,5.317880794701987
4513620,3,B00508W3MU,"This film is partially based on the treatment of some actual pilots, like WW II and Korean War ace Walker Mahurin, that were captured by the North Koreans and tortured into signing fake confessions of atrocities. Some of these men were treated pretty badly by the Air Force upon their return to America. William Holden's character is one of those men. The real reason to watch this is the really impressive shots of Edwards AFB during the early years of the jet age. The panorama of real aircraft on the ramp and the aerial photography are the best parts of the film.",1330732800,15,567,4.568627450980392
4513621,4,B00508W3MU,"I've always loved this movie, great flying sequences, bold color, etc.  However; there is a fair amount of misleading information in the blurb for this dvd edition.  First it has not been re-mastered, second it's not wide screen, and third it's not a dvd...it's a dvd-r. I was all set to buy this as soon as it was released, but the initial price was $25.99 if I'm not mistaken.  That's grossly over priced, and when it finally dropped down to $19.99 I bought it.  Compare this product to Twelve O'Clock High and you get the idea.  If the distributors were not willing to do this release properly, why not just make it available for download and be done with it.",1328054400,7,662,4.483333333333333

8450913,4,B00508W3MU,"Great movie.  Sadly, not pressed, or burned on M-DISC

I completely understand that obscure movies like this may not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would have gladly paid a dollar or two more for a disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. M-Disc last 100s of years.  (You can burn an M-Disc at home too.)

This review is for the actual item I received from Amazon. If you are after a, ""pure movie review"", I suggest you look at the International Movie Database. There you will find many reviews without regard to the delivery mechanism.

All airplanes that never made it to the silver screen in many other movies are featured here in glorious living WarnerColor. Set against a backdrop of a pilot  (William Holden) brainwashed as a POW during the Korean War and struggling to regain his self-respect and the respect of his peers,this look at the Edwards AFB of the mid-1950's is a real time capsule and feast for the aviation enthusiast or Historian. While bootleg copies have circulated in the past , this is the first legal release of the the movie in any form ( VHS, DVD,Blue-Ray) ever ! The print it was made from fared badly in storage, so some of the color is off, but the scenes are still worth it. When was the last time you saw an XB-51 doing barrel rolls ? James Garner ( later the star of ""Maverick"" ) gets his first screen outing in a minor part . Lloyd Nolan stars as the gruff USAF General with a soft spot for good pilots ( is there any other kind of USAF General ?). There is of course the obligatory love triangle ( both Holden and Nolan have a thing the Nolan's Secretary, who was Holden's girlfriend once upon a time, etc., etc.) to fill in the blank time between the flight scenes, but the real stars of the movie are the aircraft.

  For those interested in the USAF culture of the 1950s ( both on and off duty) this a a great peek into the past.  Highly recommended",1484006400,2,1436,4.343283582089552
