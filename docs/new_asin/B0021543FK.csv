8348821,5,B0021543FK,"Russell Brand is brilliantly hilarious.  I've seen this show, and loved it.  I was thrilled when I heard it was being released on dvd. But when I went to Amazon to order it, I saw that it is only available in the PAL/region 4 format. This format is incompatible with 98% of dvd players in America, mine included. So Russell, if you read this: if your American sales of this dvd are dismally bad, it's because of the format problem, and does NOT mean Yanks don't love you! We totally do! (or at least I do)",1243555200,18,505,4.25
