7130334,1,B00WDQO5WI,I am being generous to even give this a one star.  The actors were awful.,1480636800,,73,3.8666666666666667
7130335,1,B00WDQO5WI,"Story line intriguing, however poor acting is superseded by the terrible sound recording. it is so poor you can hear the lead ladies jacket pulling across the microphone as she removes it. I enjoyed many xmas specials, this is just not one.",1480204800,,240,4.738095238095238
7130336,1,B00WDQO5WI,Cheesy and terrible acting,1480032000,,26,5.75
7130337,2,B00WDQO5WI,"VERY amateur family production (with pretensions of professionalism) with extended (seemingly never ending) segments of really strained/bad acting, obvious casting-as-able (less than optimum or credible), and a vanity script (with extensive narrative).
If -- in the spirit of the Christmas season and with charity -- you wish to contribute to a family's vanity production and willingly suspend disbelief, go for it.
As with life, there are -- in regard to this movie's reality and fantasy --so many ""if onlys.""  Regrettably, there are many matters relating to this film about which there is reason for regret.
In sum:  A very flawed production may still have some value especially if reality does not intrude in your thinking-while-viewing and you suspend rational thinking.",1479513600,,774,5.441666666666666
7130338,2,B00WDQO5WI,"I agree.  Low budget and poor quality.  Half the time the images were blurry due to poor camera work.  A nice story, but pass.",1479340800,,126,4.166666666666667
7130339,4,B00WDQO5WI,Ok Xmas movie,1479254400,,13,3.6666666666666665
7130340,2,B00WDQO5WI,"VERY amatuer. Low budget, low quality.  Thin plotline, and very poorly written.  Reminds me of a neighborhood playhouse with actors who put on a Christmas play in their spare time after work. Actors even flub their lines on camera. Not even cheesy like a Hallmark Christmas movie. Very hard to even get through.",1479254400,,311,4.849056603773585
7130341,5,B00WDQO5WI,Love it!,1478822400,,8,3.5
7130342,5,B00WDQO5WI,Great,1473033600,,5,5.0
7130343,5,B00WDQO5WI,"A truly heartwarming story of a lonely bachelor who yearned for a warm Christmas back in his life many years after celebrations had ended with the passing of his parents. Excellent casting combined with good editing lends to the plot as we see that if we are willing to learn, miracles really can happen in our lives and the lives of others. Keep the tissues close. Loved it!",1449705600,,375,4.529411764705882
8712909,5,B00WDQO5WI,"Wonderful  Christmas movie  Watched it  on TBN and had to have it, This is more like a stage production than the typical Christmas movie.",1523059200,,137,4.625
8712910,5,B00WDQO5WI,"I saw this movie on tv last night and that is why I am ordering it today! Very good and I cant wait to watch it again. I was surprised at all of the negative ratings. This is a nice, clean movie and I appreciate that because there are so many sleezy, violent movies these days, it is refreshing to see a movie like this. People need to get the heart of the movie instead of complaining about the acting. However, I thought that the acting was good,  Very good movie to start off the holiday season. One reviewer said that it was a blessing and I totally agree!",1511568000,,560,4.137614678899083
8712911,4,B00WDQO5WI,Great story theme but sound was not good. Really hard to hear some of the actors at different times.,1501459200,,100,4.315789473684211
8712912,1,B00WDQO5WI,"Too painful to watch- had to turn off.  Very amateur, poor acting.  Horribly awkward.",1489622400,,85,5.0
8712913,2,B00WDQO5WI,It is too fake!!,1485129600,,16,3.25
8712914,1,B00WDQO5WI,Such terrible acting!  One of those movies that you can't stop watching because it is so terrible!  My children are still making fun of it a month later... yes... it really was that bad!,1484697600,,186,4.4411764705882355
8712915,5,B00WDQO5WI,great Christmas Movie,1484092800,,21,6.333333333333333
8712916,4,B00WDQO5WI,interesting theme.  Liked the positive approach and always like a happy ending,1483401600,,78,5.5
8712917,4,B00WDQO5WI,"As to the low ratings, it is clear that this film was made on a tight budget, so there are some deficiencies in some of the acting, the set, the script.  However, for those of us who find it difficult to find good, clean movies with a good story line, this film is a blessing.  I was able to enjoy the film for what it is, and not dwell on what it is not.  If you can't enjoy something with flaws, this movie is not for you.  But if you are not overly critical and enjoy a good heartwarming story, give it a try.",1482019200,2,512,3.894230769230769
8712918,1,B00WDQO5WI,The acting was so terrible and the video so amateur that I couldn't finish it. The story seemed to be Ok.,1481155200,,105,4.0476190476190474
