5444860,1,B00AK51NYW,"The show started off well. Then you realize that it's all about David Chang. He tries to give you the impression that he's an everyday guy and he's cool, but that's not the truth. He went to very expensive prep schools and obviously got major help from his parents starting his restaurants. I kind of got lost around the 2nd or 3rd episode, and his personality is extremely grating. Oh yes, that's what lost me in his episode, the completely unnecessary science bits that are poorly integrated into the show. He just HAS to prove how intelligent he is to the audience, instead of just letting the show roll and flow. I think that said a lot about Chang, IMO.",1375660800,3,658,4.491666666666666

5444862,5,B00AK51NYW,"Entertaining. Intelligent. Irrelevent in the correct way. Totally unpretentious , which is refreshing in the televised food world. I learned a lot, and the guest chefs are not the usual gang of ok chef/top tv personalties.
We get Sean Brock not Bobby Flay, Wyle DuFrense (spelled wrong and should nickname him shawshank) instead of Tom Colicchio, etc... real innovative chefs and real insight. Genius. Best Food Show since original Iron Chef. Mr Chang, you are why I left snooty fine dining. No obligitory hot chick chef either, but love to see an Elka Gilmore or the intense woman chef from crustacean in LA. Having Bourdain narrate is ok, he is still cool, like Jimmy Page or Tom Waits.",1371340800,5,688,4.838983050847458
5444863,5,B00AK51NYW,"If you love real food that's full of flavor and shared by someone passionate about their craft... then David Chang's Mind of Chef is a must see video. As founder of Famous Dave's Legendary Real Pit Barbecue, I am always on a quest to learn from others at the top of their game. David Chang is not your usual ""foodie"" type of chef but someone who has real street-smart type food wisdom that is not pretentious like a lot of celebrity chefs. Watching David work his craft, you will immediately know you are watching the real deal! This video is a great video to share with anyone who loves the real world of food right down to the nitty gritty! I had to watch this video several times and I picked up different ideas and perspectives about the development of great tasting recipes, plate presentation, and robust flavors... by one of the most exciting restaurateurs who goes by no one else's rules but in the truest sense of the word...this is one chef who truly follows his gut!

5444865,1,B00AK51NYW,"I loved series so much, I pre-ordered and waited for months. Once it arrived I popped in and it stayed frozen on main screen, there was no selection cursor to play, or go to individual chapters. I returned and awaited my replacement copy. I just received that copy and it doesn't work either. Same problems, I even tried in multiple players. Now I don't know what to do? I want a working copy more than anything but am getting tired of the hassle.",1365984000,3,447,4.397590361445783
5444866,4,B00AK51NYW,"Great TV show, but -1 star for the video aspect ratio. It's 2013 and they are still releasing DVD's that are encoded for 4:3 TV's. Ridiculous.

Note that even though this TV show was filmed in 16:9 widescreen, and the DVD is listed as ""Widescreen"", the actual video format is 4:3. The individual episodes and bonus scenes are 16:9 letterboxed to a final 4:3 aspect ratio. There are horizontal black bars encoded into the video (see uploaded screenshot), so if you watch this DVD on a widescreen TV, you will see horizontal bars encoded into the video and vertical black bars because the content is 4:3. Hopefully your TV or DVD player has a ""zoom"" feature.

8552916,3,B00AK51NYW,"Decent series. I got it after watching it on Netflix and they took it off. However reason I didn't give it 4 stars isn't because of the content but because the disc has 2 flaws, 1, I think critial and the other an annoyance. The annoyance, is at the beginning and end of each episode is an commerical from breville. I can see why this would be since it's PBS and they need funding. The flaw one though I thought should have been there is a play all button. You need to individiually select each episode to watch rather than just autoplaying them. This seemed to me like a no brainer to have as an option.",1484006400,,604,4.2155172413793105
8552917,5,B00AK51NYW,"I recently stumbled upon this truly magical gem at my local library. Good God!  David Chang has changed my life. This was my very first time watching these travel cooking shows with chefs, literally ever. I was ""off put"" by Anthony Bourdaine talk trash upon Rachel Ray years back. So I had never bothered with his show. But good, I get it now. The difference between a cooker and a chef.... I GET Anthony Bourdaine.

Now I'm not a foodie per say, but I do love food and a damn fine cook. But watching this series by Chef David Chang has stretched by brain to new dimensions and help me elevate my appreciation of food, and test out some of his techniques that he presents. (and purchase new kitchen gizmos... yay Amazon! ) Bravo, PBS simply brilliant!!! Had to buy it for myself & as gifts, it was THAT good.

One final item.....  ""Yakatori Chicken Wing""  OMG!!!",1467504000,,862,4.464968152866242

8552925,5,B00AK51NYW,"I don't consider myself much of a foodie but I grew to enjoy David Chang's approach to cooking after seeing one of the shows on PBS.  He does a good job of explaining terms and concepts.  I find the show entertaining. After seeing the most of the series on cable, I wanted to be able to share it with my foodie brother & niece.

There is an issue with the DVD format but as far as content- it is excellent. I really enjoyed the series.",1376006400,4,435,4.094117647058823
