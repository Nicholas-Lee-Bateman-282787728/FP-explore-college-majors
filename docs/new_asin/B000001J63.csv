7902044,5,B000001J63,"It was great fun to watch the stars of the old show perform some of their material current day with the same vigor they had low those many years ago.  What talent they exhibit!  I particularly LOVE the Lennon Sisters, a lovely group of entertaining and talented women then and now!
