4471366,3,B004UXUWEC,"I really like the cast of this small-scale 2011 comedy directed by Jesse Peretz, and Paul Rudd has certainly proven to be a likeable comedy lead not afraid to make a fool of himself (2009's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Love-You-Man/dp/B001PR0Y6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Love You, Man</a>, for example). Whereas he usually plays nebbish versions of the overly sensitive male, the actor goes in quite a different direction with this character-driven vehicle playing Ned Rockliffe, a bearded, long-haired man-child so gullible that he gives everyone the benefit of the doubt, much to the consternation of his constantly frustrated sisters. The concept is amusing on the surface, but the execution is on the messy side with a surprising, perhaps unintended amount of misogyny informing the storyline. The approach could have been more forgivable if there were plenty of laughs, but aside from a few unexpected sight gags, the humor is more  observational in nature and generated only a few chuckles from me.

Co-written by Evgenia Peretz and David Schisgall, the movie opens with Ned ignorantly selling marijuana to a cop at his weekend organic produce stand. After he gets released from eight months in prison, he gets dumped by his organic-farmer girlfriend Janet. She not only selfishly keeps his beloved dog ""Willie Nelson"" but had already started shacking up with a new hippie boyfriend Billy who actually sympathizes with Ned. Homeless and without any means to take care of himself, Ned looks to his three sisters for shelter. First, he stays with Liz, the mousy, constantly exhausted mother of two whose filmmaker husband Dylan is cheating on her with his documentary subject, a comely Russian ballerina. When Liz, a severe pacifist, finds Ned teaching her son karate moves, he moves in with Miranda, a pretentious writer for Vanity Fair, who will stop at nothing to secure a cover story about a scandalized socialite who also takes a liking to Ned. Finally, when Miranda tires of his unintentional meddling, he shows up at the door of his youngest sister Natalie, a space cadet who can't make up her mind about committing to her lesbian partner Cindy.

Rudd is one of the few comic actors who can get away with playing the title role in such a deceptively facile manner. Emily Mortimer and especially Zooey Deschanel nicely play Liz and Natalie to their accustomed types, but I was most surprised how well Elizabeth Banks channeled the brittle edginess of Parker Posey to play Miranda with such fierce comic conviction since she usually plays distaff versions of Ned in her comedies. The three actresses definitely manage a convincing sisterly rapport full of judgment and pettiness. In a reversal of the wet-blanket role she played in last year's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-Do-You-Know/dp/B003EYVXXC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How Do You Know</a>, Kathryn Hahn goes for spiteful as Janet. The cumulative effort of these actresses does not offset the ""sour grapes"" attitude that the script has them convey to react to Ned's careless yet well-meaning behavior. Only Shirley Knight survives the estrogen-filled scorn with her sweet turn as the alcoholic mother. Steve Coogan, Adam Scott, Hugh Dancy, T.J. Miller, and Rashida Jones all show up in smaller roles. The disappointing ending appears slapped on as if it belonged to some more mainstream comedy.",1320710400,,3461,5.477528089887641
4471367,4,B004UXUWEC,"this movie isn't for everyone. and if you're looking for a movie that's just an overall ""laugh-out-loud"" this isn't it.

REMEMBER: this is a dramedy!!

however, i liked it. paul rudd's character is fantastic and really gets to you. he makes you wanna enjoy the little things and be nice to everyone. he has his flaws, but he never intentionally means to ruin anything. if i could choose to be anyone it'd be his character. he doesn't care about, well, anything except his dog. and that to me is just awesome.
the movie overall gave me just a few laughs, but it's more of an inner-enjoyment then anything. some people have to give it a chance because it can be slow, but if you watch it all the way through you shouldn't be disappointed. unless you're looking for a stupid comedy (i have no problems with these, but i'm just saying.)",1319932800,,832,4.503311258278146
4471368,4,B004UXUWEC,"Our Idiot Brother is a dramedy about a family with undiscovered problems and the good-hearted idiot that goes to jail for selling pot to a uniformed officer. Quirky and risqu, it hits on all modern comedy cylinders. But what sets Our Idiot Brother apart are the surprisingly uncommon scenes: the horribly mismatched romantic subplot between Lady Arabella (Janet Montgomery) and Ned (Paul Rudd) that ends in a sudden but fantastic fashion, a horribly botched threesome, and the bond between dog and man-child.

Ned (Paul Rudd) is the only brother of three lovely but unknowingly tormented sisters. Zooey Deschanel plays a non-homosexual lesbian, Elizabeth Banks plays the quintessential job-obsessed shrew, and Emily Mortimer plays the non-sexy, clueless, stay-at-home mom. When Ned goes to jail for trying to help out a depressed uniformed police officer with a few ounces of weed at a local farmers' market, his rehabilitation and parole thrusts him into the lives of his sisters. Idealistic but clueless Ned stumbles through each of their lives, inadvertently exposing all the problems that rest just beneath the surface. Each encounter mixes the cute and goofy with the awkward and dramatic, and while the ending flirts with cheesy ""only in the movies"" perfection, it is hard not to smile and think, ""that is how the world should work"".

While the script takes chances that differentiate this movie from all others like it, the writing is really the cast that brings this film its joie de vivre. Paul Rudd plays the blissfully ignorant ideologue to a tee. In every scene his mannerisms and his character's love of life are captivating. Elizabeth Banks and Zooey Deschanel each bring a peculiar brand of comedy that seems to fit this movie perfectly. And Emily Mortimer's Liz bursts with heart. While each of these characters are a joy to watch, the bottle scenes where two or more of the characters are together really resonate, both comically and dramatically.

In Our Idiot Brother there were a few too many ""bros"" and ""mans,"" in response to a confrontation, one character actually utters something akin to, ""I'm only gonna respond to that with love,"" however, despite edging on too granola for a wide release, the real flaw to Our Idiot Brother is the transparency of the script. Each conflict is hinted at too early in the story: one sister's husband is a little too cold and distant from the onset, another sister is portrayed a little too straight to be gay, and the last sister's inability to have already fallen in love with her best friend is apparent to everyone but her (Spoilers, I guess). For a script that was refreshingly unique, these spoon-fed conflicts seem to indicate the filmmakers' hesitancy to push their audience too far. And in a movie with a shockingly frank portrayal of a threesome gone wrong, hesitancy must be abandoned.

Our Idiot Brother is the hilarious portrayal of a man who loves too much and the devastating effects it has on those he cares about. If you can handle the Woodstock hangovers (dreadlocks, communing with nature, and ""man"" included, sadly none of the music) and the not-so-subtle conflicts, the laughs are worth the price of admission. Stay for the credits. The bloopers of this cast that obviously enjoy each other, both in the film and out, leaves you parting without any ill will for the price of the ticket.",1315785600,10,3364,4.959219858156028
4471369,4,B004UXUWEC,"Our Idiot Brother premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival and was well-received enough that the Weinstein Company picked it up for distribution. With an indie sensibility strongly intact, it's not a film typically found in wide release, despite boasting actors well-acquainted with the mainstream and story elements similar to those found in more mainstream fare. The independent style of the film, not reflected in the look or quality of the film, just the way the story is told, may alienate mainstream viewers unable to accept the quirky nature of the characters.

The premise is pretty simplistic. We first meet Ned (Paul Rudd), the idiot brother of the title, working at a farmer's market alongside his dog Willie Nelson. Ned is yanked from his peaceful existence after he sells weed to a police officer. A police officer in uniform. After he is released from prison, Ned, whose beard and scruffy appearance make him resemble Jesus, finds that his hippie girlfriend (Kathryn Hahn) has moved on and refuses to return Willie Nelson to him. Ned has three sisters: Liz (Emily Mortimer), an insecure housewife and mother, married to Dylan (Steve Coogan), a heartless documentary filmmaker; Miranda (Elizabeth Banks), a journalist for Vanity Fair ruthlessly attempting to publish her first article; and Natalie (Zooey Deschanel), a bi-sexual hipster who lives with her girlfriend Cindy (Rashida Jones) and five other roommates. The script places Ned in the care of his three sisters, where he proceeds to intervene in their lives and wreak havoc.

There's not much more to it than that as Our Idiot Brother is rather short on plot, but makes up for it with an almost unheard of amount of emphasis on character. The characters in the film are well-developed, with distinctly drawn personalities that ultimately set them (and the film) apart from traditional Hollywood fare. The characters inhabiting the film (with only a few exceptions) are perpetually nice, particularly the ""idiot"" of the title. Ned is achingly sweet, very trusting, easily manipulated, easy-going, and seemingly incapable of lying. His character is a person that could make the world a better place and he's not so much an ""idiot"" as a very gentle soul. Paul Rudd, who possesses a charm and likability that is unequaled by his contemporaries, really carries this movie and is most responsible for making it work. Ned is such a warm character that he's nearly impossible to dislike, even if you don't like the film itself.

The sisters of Our Idiot Brother don't fall into the Hollywood trapping of being tired clichs, although some of the characterization may initially seem familiar. Just the idea that three siblings can be so vastly different, with their only similarity being their love for each other is kind of a clich at this point. What's refreshing is that familiar elements like Liz being an insecure housewife unaware that she's married to a snake and Miranda being a bossy, ruthless journalist attempting to establish herself while alienating male attention are developed enough that it's easy to accept and believe. Even Natalie isn't the typical Hollywood lesbian, as her character's sexuality doesn't seem to be used to provoke a reaction. It's treated with realism, with only the slightest acknowledgement that it's out of the ordinary (for some people). All three are very capable actresses and they carry the film just as much as Rudd. Deschanel brings a deadpan-perfection to her role and is able to play with the most original character arc of the three. All three sisters bring different styles of humor, but I found Deschanel most amusing, although this could be a biased evaluation due to my complete adoration for her. All of the characters are quirky, as is the norm for an indie comedy, but the script fleshes them out and makes them three-dimensional. The film makes a valiant attempt to draw its comedy from the characters rather than relying on contrived situations and clever quips to make up its humor. Our Idiot Brother has its share of clever dialogue certainly, but it's much more pre-occupied with character interactions.

This movie will have its share of people who dislike it. Marketed as a comedy, Our Idiot Brother is not a full-blown comedy in the vein of Judd Apatow with laugh-out-loud moments every few seconds. Remember that `comedy' is defined as ""a movie of light and humorous character with a happy or cheerful ending."" A comedy is not required to make its audience laugh every few seconds or even once, for that matter. The dialogue between Ned and his parole officer (an amusing performance by Sterling K. Brown) early on is very funny, but the majority of the film simply maintains a tone of comedy without becoming a complete laugh riot.

During the first half of Our Idiot Brother, I wasn't sure if I was actually enjoying the film. It seemed a bit uneven, wasn't hilariously funny, and its ""witless man helps better the lives of those around him"" plot has been done to death in Hollywood. What I found was that Our Idiot Brother is a slow-build that sinks in as it progresses. The script/film is not perfect, but takes a familiar story and does something effective and successful with it. It's a heartwarming film that works on the strengths of its characters and the emotion it draws from you on their behalf. By the time it reached its ""cutesy"" ending (strongly reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/500-Days-of-Summer/dp/B001UV4XUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">(500) Days of Summer</a>), I accepted it as a perfectly logical conclusion. Opinions will be sharply divided over the film, but there's plenty to like about the characters that inhabit it and the performances that carry it.

4471370,3,B004UXUWEC,"A loser brother is released from jail after selling pot to a uniformed police officer. He creates havoc among his siblings and must try to straighten himself out. I like the premise and the cast, but at times I felt the film meandered a bit and I wasn't sure where it was going. It wasn't quite as funny as I had hoped, but it does have its moments. Toward the end it seems to come together a bit, but I was disappointed. This is movie that is not bad, but it's not all that good either.",1314489600,2,487,4.083333333333333
4471371,3,B004UXUWEC,"Toward the beginning of Our Idiot Brother, Paul Rudd's character Ned says ""I like to think that if you really give people the benefit of the doubt, see their best intentions, people will rise to the occasion.""  I bring this line up because it really is the crux of the film's story.  However, after giving this decidedly uneven comedy the benefit of the doubt, I still walked away disappointed.

Our Idiot Brother, as the title suggests, is about the idiot brother of a family.  Ned, the lovable idiot that he is, is released from jail after stupidly selling pot to a police officer.  Upon release, his girlfriend moved on with her life and Ned has nowhere to go.  Ned's sisters (Banks, Deschanel, and Emily Mortimer) decide to step up and help him out by letting him stay at their places briefly.

The best, most charming moments of the film involve Ned and his very caring personality.  As much of an idiot as he is (and believe me, he lives up to the title), he really does mean well in what he does, and it's absolutely heart-warming when we see Ned being a great uncle or a caring brother.

That's just about where I stop piling praise, however.  The film was advertised as a comedy, not a melodramatic one.  That's where director Jesse Peretz hits some speed-bumps.  Peretz mistakes gooey giggles for righteous laughs one too many times, and the results are extremely uneven, to a point where I was constantly checking my phone in the theater, which is NEVER a good thing.

BOTTOM LINE:  While it is very heart-warming and inspiring, Our Idiot Brother doesn't really deserve to be considered a full-fledged comedy.

Paul Rudd plays a character - a man child in his thirties who is so trusting to all people that he has no filter on what information to keep to himself and what to share with the rest of the world.  His mix of being kind, naive and not so bringt, puts him in a situation where he needs help from his family once he is out of jail, jobless and with no means to even feed his dog.  In his search for the temporary living arrangements while on parole, he floats between family members.  This in turn creates less than favorable situations for them all as disclosure of the events outside of their well maintained lives seem to show not so perfect situations and people they are surrounded with.

She lacked all chemistry expected of a lesbian relationship. Simply a blah performance for an otherwise talented actress.
Having said this, Rashida Jones did such a great job. She had fun with it and at least attempted to appear authentically, which I appreciate thoroughly.

Not exceptionally well-written or plotted, and with a dearth of fully formed, sympathetic characters (his sisters are all fairly objectionable sorts, exemplified by the wooden and snarky Elizabeth Banks), Our Idiot Brother fails to generate the momentum necessary to maintain keen interest. I found myself smiling goofily (like Ned) and alternating between naps and trips to the kitchen for caffeine.

Rudd's performance is about what you'd expect- an affable, kind, fun uncle you just want to take home and hang with.

4471505,2,B004UXUWEC,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

'Our Idiot Brother' reminds me of two other films involving a passive interloper who affects the lives of a group of siblings. They are the Spanish Academy Award winner for Best Foreign Film of 1994, 'Belle Epoque' and the 2001 Irish/English import, 'About Adam'. In both, a young Lothario is the catalyst for awakening the sexual impulses of various family members (in Belle Epoque, it's three sisters and in About Adam, it's three sisters and a brother).

'Our Idiot Brother' is a variation on this theme. Ned Rochlin (Paul Rudd) is by no means a Lothario, but is definitely a passive interloper who acts as a catalyst, eventually transforming the lives of his three sisters, for the good. Ned, a latter day hippie, hardly represents the spirit of Bacchus (as in the other two films), but rather a type who inspires spontaneity. The best part of 'Our idiot Brother' is Paul Rudd, who plays the likable Ned and one finds him charming and offbeat (except maybe for moments when he acts like a complete fool, allowing himself to be conned by uniformed a police officer, who convinces nave Ned to sell him some marijuana at a local market).

Unfortunately, the women Ned plays off against throughout the film simply lack the charm of the film's protagonist. For starters, there's his girlfriend, Janet, who was living on a biodynamic farm at the time Ned is arrested, and when he returns, promptly shows him the door, having shacked up with another hippie type, who is just as goofy as Ned. What's worse is that Janet covets Ned's dog (whose name is 'Willie Nelson'). It's hard to like a humorless character like Janet, whose main characteristic is to be a foil to Ned, in her unrelenting pursuit of good old 'Willie'. Ned's sisters are no more likable than Ned's ex. Take for example, Liz (Emily Mortimer) who's married to Dylan, a pretty much repulsive documentary filmmaker, who Ned unwittingly exposes as a cheating philanderer. Before things break down between Liz and Dylan, Liz has trouble accepting Ned's exhortation that they treat her son River like a normal kid (the parents can't stomach Ned's promotion of 'violent' activities, such as martial arts instead of more 'cultured activities' like ballet dancing).

Then there's another unpleasant sister, Miranda, a journalist, who uses Ned to obtain a gossipy personal story from a royal celebrity, who takes Ned under her wings, after she's drawn to his honesty. Ned won't betray the celebrity's confidence, and surly Miranda boots Ned out of her apartment. More unpleasantness: Cindy, the lesbian girlfriend of Ned's other sister, Natalie, who should be the most ethical of all the characters, since she's an attorney, concocts this sad plan to go with Ned, and steal his dog back from his ex-girlfriend. It gets even more unfunny, when Ned blurts out that Natalie has been having an affair with a man, much to the chagrin of Cindy, who had no idea that Natalie was bisexual.

The 'dark moment' of the second Act (if there is a dark moment) is when Ned admits that he's been smoking marijuana again, to his parole officer, who's forced to arrest him. Ned doesn't want to be bailed out of jail until the sisters are able to find a way to procure Ned's beloved 'Willie Nelson', which they do, when Ned's ex-girlfriend's boyfriend, decides that giving Ned the dog, is the 'right thing to do'.

Ned's good-naturedness finally pays off when Liz decides to start dating again, Miranda begins a relationship with a neighbor she was really meant for and Cindy supports Natalie, as she decides to have her baby. As for Ned, he starts a candle shop with his ex-wife's boyfriend and then meets a woman, who he instantly falls for (note that the woman's dog is named 'Dolly Parton').

Our Idiot Brother's denouement unfortunately is unearned. That's because we ultimately don't find the sisters' positive transformations engaging due to not feeling invested in them earlier. Instead, the film's scenarists needed to make them more nuanced, and certainly more sympathetic, despite their shortcomings. In that way, Ned's affability and trustworthiness, would not have gone for naught.",1388448000,,4171,4.933048433048433

4471526,4,B004UXUWEC,"""Our Idiot Brother,"" despite its title and its comedic billing, is a surprisingly heartwarming tale of Ned (Paul Rudd), a well-intentioned but rather naive fellow. When the movie begins we see him selling produce from the farm on which he is living at a local farmers' market. A policeman in uniform comes up to him and hints strongly that he would like to buy some pot. Ned resists, but after much protestation by the policeman that he really wants the weed and won't arrest him, Ned gives him a bag (along with some rhubarb) and refuses to take payment. Only after much cajoling on the part of the policeman does he agree to take 20 dollars, at which time the policeman arrests him. Ned spends nine months in jail before he is released. (This was one of the few things in this movie I found improbable, since it is obvious that this is a clear case of entrapment.) When Ned returns to the farm, he finds the girl with whom he was living with another man. All Ned really wants, however, is to take his dog (named Willie Nelson), but the girl refuses.

Ned then lives in turn with his mother and his sisters, as each pawns him off on one of the others. During this time he continues to commit various blunders which create more problems for him or his sisters (such as telling his sisters about the infidelity of their partners and, unprompted, telling his parole officer that he has smoked a joint with a younger fellow).

In the end, Ned finds his niche as the proprietor of a candle shop. (His business partner is the fellow who had moved in with his ex-girlfriend.) He is doing what he wants and is happy. (And he has been reunited with Willie Nelson.)

Although this movie is not at all profound, it does a good job of portraying Ned as a fellow who, despite his naivete and his occasional lack of common sense, is a totally goodhearted and likable person, one whose presence makes the world a somewhat better place.",1381708800,,1921,4.482857142857143

4471542,4,B004UXUWEC,"Paul Rudd has tended to stay in a certain groove that could be damaging to his career. Though this doesn't stray far from that groove it's still a nice respite.

Here's the scoop. Ned (Paul Rudd) is the only male in a litter with three other sisters. He's kind of a dim bulb but, he's a true innocent, and just not in tune with how lousy people can be. He ends up doing some time for selling pot to a uniformed cop. When he gets out his girl has evicted him from their organic farm while she takes up with another beau. He now needs the support of his sisters and mom to get back into the real world. His innocence ends up causing his sisters no end of difficulty and things come to a head.

This is a big-hearted film. His sisters get ticked at him because they feel he's screwing up their lives, while in reality, it's their dishonesty and poor choices that are doing them in. He simply doesn't realize that he is exposing that side of them. Rudd finds the right note for his character. He's a sweet guy with a great capacity for love. He just needs to find the right groove to let it all happen. His sisters are a mixed lot. Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) is a high-powered writer for a magazine trying to score her first big article. Liz (Emily Mortimer) is married to a documentary film maker. She has let herself go after the birth of their recent child and her husband treats her like an ashtray. Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) is sexually confused and it's causing grief with her lover Cindy (Rashida Jones). This is some shrewd casting. All the actors have appeal to a like-minded audience and all have appeared in similar movies, so the producers are pretty much pre-selecting their following.

The acting, directing, editing and music are on par with the project. Some of the scenes are a bit clunky, but others are really well written with a squinty eye on how overly in tune we are with ourselves and the society around us. This is a very ""now"" movie.

This isn't quite worth the four stars I gave I but it is an enjoyable, feel-good flick that will easily pass the viewer's time. This isn't a fine wine. It's more like a good craft brew. Enjoy.",1378425600,,2148,4.389447236180905

4471564,4,B004UXUWEC,"There were moments during this movie when I felt like I was being totally manipulated. Paul Rudd plays Ned, a man looking for some kind of stability in his life, after his stint in prison. Despite the title, I wouldn't call his character an idiot. Yes, he did sell marijuana to a uniformed police officer, but this opening scene reveals more about his personality than his seemingly dim wit. Rather, Ned is a kind of model of a man who only sees the good in others, and tries to live his life to the service of these people.

Of course, this means others often take advantage of him. Over the course of the film, Ned tries to raise enough money to move into a barn at the farm where he worked, prior to his stint in jail. While he does this, he lives, for a short time, with each of his three sisters. As you can imagine, his time with each sister ends with them completely frustrated at him, and passing him along to the next. The sisters are all played by talented actress. Initially, I had trouble accepting them all as one family, one sister even has a British accent, but the story was so well written that I soon forgot about this completely.

This film is never splashy in its delivery. There are some moments in particular where you could feel the whole production trying to make you feel a certain way. It worked! Despite my head telling me how ridiculous the entire thing was, I couldn't help but to be sucked in to all of the emotions of the characters.

4471584,1,B004UXUWEC,"It's been a while since I watched a comedy that doesn't even *try* to be funny nor delivers any kind of noticeable storyline either.  Instead it settles for the most generic type of pointless ""plot"" ever- a man with good intentions played by Paul Rudd finds himself in several awkward and clumsy situations and nobody wants him around but... much to everyone's dislike (mine most certainly included) he never leaves.  He just hangs around doing basically nothing... the WHOLE time!

Let's see, playing karate with a little kid and trying to get him out of dance class.  Is this where the humor is?  This is stupid.  How about when the little boy imitates karate moves in front of others while his parents are watching?  Still not remotely laughing.  How about Paul's character pretending to throw a cup of urine on another guy while struggling to use the bathroom only for the cup to be empty?  Or when he walks in and sees his friend naked with a woman?  And people actually think this is not only acceptable for a movie, but *funny?*

Only if you've been living alone on a deserted island for 30 years and desperately craved any kind of jokes or human contact would this satisfy your needs.  Our Idiot Brother is the kind of pointless film that girlfriends drag their boyfriends to the movie theater to see on Valentine's Day.  Please don't watch it.",1360713600,7,1352,4.654008438818566

4471604,3,B004UXUWEC,"Our Idiot Brother is a forgettable time waster, but it does have its moments. I enjoyed watching Paul Rudd be a truly sweet and kind character who fails miserably at most of his pursuits.

While there was some comedic value to lines uttered by the three starring actresses, I found them to be a bit whiny and unsympathetic. However, the interactions that Rudd had with Elizabeth Banks, Zooey Deschanel, and Emily Mortimer during the times he spent with each were funny and touching at a handful of times. Steve Coogan, who plays Mortimer's insufferable cheating husband is pretty funny, and the viewer gets to see nearly all of him in a scene (hands over the kids' eyes, folks).

Although it was pegged as a comedy, the film is much darker and much less comedic than I expected it to be. I do like that that sort of movie, generally, but if I'm expecting a comedy, I'd like it to be funnier.

4471621,4,B004UXUWEC,"Paul Rudd is excellent in this smart little quirk of a film that slyly but clearly portrays the ways in which we rely on mutually agreed-upon lies to make it through our lives. As the ""idiot"" brother Ned of the title, Rudd infiltrates the lives of his three sisters, each successful by her own definition: Natalie (Zooey Deschanel), the pansexual lesbian-ish sister in a loving monogamous relationship with Cindy (masterfully played by Rashida Jones); Liz (Emily Mortimer), the hyper-conscious and sensitive Mom committed to raising self-actualized kids; and Miranda (Elizabeth Banks, who bears a very spooky resemblance to Parker Posey in this film), the cutthroat journalist who writes for Vanity Fair. By sheer virtue of his almost child-like honesty, Ned manages to learn secrets about each one of his sisters--secrets that, once revealed, have very amusing but also very profound consequences. The script is intelligent, the performances are superb all around (including Adam Scott, T.J. Miller, and Shirley Knight in supporting roles), and the comedy is leavened by a very subtle wisdom that permeates the film. In some ways, this is a male version of a ""chick flick,"" and I mean that in the best way possible.",1355097600,,1216,5.177664974619289

When the trailers were shown long ago, I figured it would be one of these popcorn, Saturday afternoon with nothing to do kinda movies to watch, nothing special but nothing to criticize. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy a single scene of this movie. Not one laugh. Rudd was OK in the role of his innocently naive character, but his clumsiness that seemed to get him and his family in trouble with every mistake -- which would usually be a funny setup -- didn't elicit any laughter.

4471650,3,B004UXUWEC,"Though this film falls into that general category of potty mouth no-brainer genre that floods the airways and cinemas today, it does have some redeeming points. Jesse Peretz (who also directs), Evgenia Peretz, and David Schisgall came up with this stew pot story, populated it with some fine actors and the result isles disappointing than expected. When a line by the `idiot brother' Ned states `I like to think that if you put your trust out there; if you really give people the benefit of the doubt, see their best intentions, people will rise to the occasion' then we know that some thought was invested in this otherwise indulgent silly comedy.

Ned (Paul Rudd, of course) lived a happy hippie life growing organic vegetables on a farm with his hippie girlfriend and his dog named Willie Nelson, but unexpected troubles arise when in a sting when he gives marijuana to a police officer and takes money for the transaction - recipe for jail. When he gets out of jail, he at first lives with his understanding mother (Shirley Knight) and then is off to live/freeload with his sisters - Zooey Deschanel, Elizabeth Banks, and Emily Mortimer - each with her won problems of infidelity (Steve Coogan), pregnancy while in a lesbian relationship (with Rashida Jones), and falsified news gathering. While Ned is still happy, his sisters are much less so after he manages to screw up one marriage, one job opportunity, one budding relationship and one domestic partnership. He sees those problems as breakdowns in communication, but his sisters see him as an idiot. It is the aftermath of the comedic blowups that gives a bit of reality testing to the sisters.

One can wonder why actors of the caliber of Emily Mortimer, Shirley Knight, and Hugh Dancy (in a brief cameo) align with duds like this, but times are tough for everyone and probably the producers thought this film would appeal to audiences in the theaters...wrong. Catch it on Video on Demand and settle back for a series of tired jokes with a few moments of insight. Grady Harp, September 12",1346630400,,2049,4.818181818181818

4471652,4,B004UXUWEC,"Paul Rudd grabbed me in this movie. His portrayal of sweet, kind-hearted, happy-go-lucky Ned is captivating, charming, and downright funny. He is the perfect comic relief next to his too often uptight and exhausting sisters.

Ned's trusting nature lands him in jail and when he is released he finds that his former life is no more. Forced to live with first one sister before moving to the next, Ned manages to hold on to his true nature - he is able to see the good in even the most horrible person. And although each of his sisters manages to enmesh herself in a complicated situation (relationship, job, etc.), Ned remains the one constant in the family and the one whose light ends up prevailing.

I have to admit that I expected this to be another juvenile movie, poking fun at stoners and dragging out the same tired cliches about life in the fast lane and the benefits of slowing down and taking each day one at a time. There are those elements here, but this movie suprised me by the quality of the writing and the depth of the characters. While perhaps not an Oscar contender, this is a charming, sweet, funny, touching and worthwhile movie. I enjoyed it and have happily recommended it to others.

After he is released from jail, his girlfriend (the brilliant Kathryn Hahn) is dating another guy and she decides to keep his beloved dog, Willie Nelson.

We don't choose them, we don't always like them. But in the end we cannot deny our love for them.  And, no matter how deeply that love is buried it's there and will quickly make its way to the surface when that love is all that's left.  That's what this movie is about.

In a sense, this movie is a roller coaster mimicking real life family relationships, and how convoluted they can become. Of course, Paul Rudd is the idiot brother, all though in reality, he's really more like the naive brother rather than an actual idiot. I won't talk about the story too much, but I thought the casting was stellar and the concept was well thought out. The movie itself was charming even as it delved into a few real issues. I just really enjoyed watching it. I debated how to rate this, but reflecting upon it, I felt satisfied and content. It wasn't the greatest movie of all time, but it was really good.

The funniest parts of the movie were almost all present in the trailers. Combine that with a cliched formulaic script where someone comes in and messes with peoples lives, only to find out in the end that it was all for the best, and you end up with a weak boring movie. Paul Rudd is the generic hippie organic farmer, and while I enjoyed his performance, the role just didn't have enough life or believability. His sister's problems have all been done before, there's a frumpy housewife with a troubled household & a cheating husband, a bossy reporter that's too busy to notice to love of her life right next door, and a lesbian couple with one partner going through a bisexual crisis. The three sisters' idiot brother comes into their lives and seemingly screws everything up, but when the smoke passes they realize that he was only bringing to light problems that were already there.

With a loaded cast and a simple, engaging direction, it's got the right pieces in place to build a sleepy, optimistic comedy about the nice guy (a very dude-like Paul Rudd) who almost always finishes last. Instead, it wastes most of its time egging on the self-centered, spoiled women around him, basking in the glow of their vapid, hollow lives while they carelessly take advantage of his somber situation. It's humorous at heart, if not particularly funny, and often steps away just as things seem to be about to turn the corner and erupt into wild chaos. The only thing more depressing than watching Rudd's poor, well-intentioned, passive hippie get repeatedly stomped into the mud is seeing how insufferably predictable the plot can become. A total paint-by-numbers watercolor job that doesn't seem to mean the happy message it throws up on-screen before the credits.",1337644800,2,919,5.0130718954248366

4471759,2,B004UXUWEC,"Have you ever seen a movie where you saw the trailer and thought man that looks funny...only to be completely disappointed once you saw the film? Welcome to OUR IDIOT BROTHER.

Ned Rochlin (Paul Rudd) is an innocent. Well not quite. I thought more of him as a waste head with visions of a grander world where no one does wrong to anyone else. It's the ideas that the hippies had in the sixties, a peaceful world where everyone can do what they want without affecting anyone else. Too bad reality always seemed to creep in.

As the film opens Ned finds himself arrested after selling grass to a local policeman. He was duped into doing so when the policeman convinced him he didn't have a problem with Ned selling drugs and needed it for a headache. Ned is convicted, spends his time in jail and when released comes home to find out his girlfriend dumped him for a new guy and doesn't want him around. Not only that, she refuses to give him back his dog Willie Nelson that she honestly could care less about. With no place to go, Ned returns to his mother's home and looks for ways to save up money so he can buy into the organic farm he and his girlfriend owned together.

Into the picture arrives Ned's three sisters and along with them their own problems which he places himself in the middle of as he roams from one to the other living there while working. The first is Liz (Emily Mortimer) who is a stay at home mom married to documentary film maker Dylan (Steve Coogan). The couple is the stereotypical by the book parents whose skills are learned through the things they read and hear about as opposed to living life. Their child must get into the right schools and behave the proper way even though he hates the things they make him do. Ned finds a connection with the youngster and they become quick friends but not quite so much with his folks. Ned takes a job working with Dylan carrying his equipment but one night finds him ""shooting"" his subject, a Russian ballerina, in the nude. Yes, they're having an affair and Ned accidentally leaks this to his other two sisters and causes a stir.

The next sister is Miranda (Elizabeth Banks), an up and coming writer for a classy magazine who is hoping for her big break. She has a chance to interview an heiress and the magazine wants her to get as much dirt from her as she can since the heiress was involved with a rather nasty fellow who videotaped their sexual escapades. Ned is working as Miranda's chauffer and inadvertently strikes up a conversation with the woman resulting in getting more information from her than Miranda does since the woman insists on not talking about the scandal. So determined to get the scoop and the job she covets so much, Miranda uses the information Ned got while simply talking to the woman, information he doesn't want her to use, that she'll go to all lengths to get it. This of course leads to Ned moving in with sister three.

Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) is a wanna be stand up comedian and part time nude model who is anything but funny. Ned moves in with her and her lesbian girlfriend but soon learns that Natalie is pregnant from a one night stand with the artist she poses for (and who Ned poses for as well). You can see where this is heading right now. Ned accidentally reveals all to the girlfriend as they attempt to retrieve Willie Nelson from his ex.

So here is the big problem with the movie. You find yourself in the company of a group of people that you could care less about. Not only could you care less about them, you find yourself loathing each and every one of them. I found myself wishing each of them would move on and I wouldn't have to hear any more about them. Ned is the sympathetic character here but he's such a dunce at times that you just want to slap him and say bud, wake up and smell the coffee.

I guess this means the actresses do a great job here. After all none of them can truly be as terrible in real life as they appear here, right? And Paul Rudd is always good in nearly everything he does. His Ned is a guy you'd love to spend time with, just not telling him anything about yourself.

The worst sin of all that this movie commits is that it never makes you laugh. That's pretty bad for a movie that was advertised as a comedy. Looking back I think I may have chuckled once or twice from start to finish, but being a comedy that's low praise. With all of the better movies out there to rent or watch this movie falls into that category of avoid at all costs. Only die hard Rudd fans will get anything out of this. Others will just be tossing good money away.",1332806400,2,4595,4.353558926487748

After watching the trailors on TV for this movie, I sort of expected something slightly like ""Dumb and Dumber"" maybe. The humor was too subtle or something and there seemed to be long stretches where there was no humor at all. At the end, Paul Rudd's character was pretty much the same as the beginning. Quite honestly, I felt that the storyline just went nowhere.

My husband watched this movie some months before I did either on pay-per-view or one of the movie channels on our satellite and he told me he wished he'd have known I was getting it from Amazon because he would have saved me the trouble. He didn't like it either and generally he likes comedies a lot more than I tend to.

His family passes him around like he is some kind of toy because they do not understand him. However, if the family would look closer they would realize that they are just as messed up as Ned is in one way or another. Throughout the movie you see Ned get into a lot of mischief and mishaps that only makes his family stronger and makes his sisters understand him better.

I think this movie is more of a drama than a comedy but it is still a really good movie. I was anxious to see it though because I am a big fan of Zooey Deschanel and I'm glad that I did.

The film doesn't have the huge laughs that you would expect with the talent of the cast, but it really doesn't need to. The story itself is clever and delivers a realistic view of relationships. Personally, I was expecting the brother to be a real idiot, like knife-in-the-toaster dumb, but he is actually quite honest and trustworthy, albeit very naive. Definitely worth watching, perhaps even a second time if it's on TV and you're looking for something easy to watch.

And not just the character, but the actor who plays him, too.

So, the character being played by Rudd is Ned Rochlin, a likeable loser.  In the opening moments of the film, he is gently coerced into selling some pot to a uniformed cop.  He was trying to ""help a guy out,"" but this is why people think Ned's an idiot.

Eight months later, he's out of jail early for good behavior.  Having nowhere else to go, for the bulk of the film he bounces between the homes of his loving mother (Shirley Knight) and three very different sisters portrayed by Emily Mortimer, Elizabeth Banks, and Zoey Deschanel.  In his own sweet way, Ned tends to cause havoc in the lives of those around him.

The film is more of a family dramedy than a flat-out comedy, but there is plenty of humor.  The performances of this ensemble cast are uniformly terrific.  And what a supporting cast it is!  In addition to the actors mentioned above, look for Steve Coogan, Katherine Hahn, Hugh Dancy (who I barely recognized in his small role), Rashida Jones (also playing way against type), TJ Miller, and other recognizable faces.

I won't claim that every moment of the film is pure gold, but overall I found it very enjoyable--and the last 15 minutes were just fantastic.  It's a film I'll be happy to view again.

Furthermore, there is a nice selection of DVD extras on the disk.  There's a fairly typical 15-minute making-of film featuring cast and crew.  There are four deleted or extended scenes, including an alternate ending.  (The one they went with was stronger, but it's always fun to see these things.)  And there's feature commentary with the director.  As is often the case, he probably could have used another person to play off of in the commentary, but it was interesting nonetheless.

I'm actually surprises me that this film wasn't more successful.  Yes, it's a little quirky, but I come back to the tag line on the film's poster, which cracked me up the first time I saw it:  Our Idiot Brother--Every family has one.  LOL.

I felt it relied way too much on drastic overuse of the f-word. Seriously, it was everywhere, and I am personally one of the word's biggest fans. But here, it was just too much.

Paul Rudd plays this guy who really nice and sweet, and he's got these three sisters who are pretty self-absorbed, superior, and selfish. They look down on him, and on their mom, who is similiar to him (their dad must have really sucked). He gets into a bit of legal trouble, he gets dumped by his girlfriend, he goes to live with each sis in turns. He messes up! Big time! Oh no!

You see where this is going, I hope. Because it's very VERY obvious. You'll probably be entertained for a little while, but this isn't the best movie you'll see all year. Rashida Jones and TJ Miller are in it, which is awesome, because TJ Miller is freaking awesome. He actually plays almost the exact same character that Paul Rudd is playing, and they are really sweet guys. Steve Coogan is also in it (but not nearly enough for my liking), playing Emily Mortimer's character's husband, with a fantastic line regarding her body.

The characters all felt one dimensional, maybe there were just too many people to focus on anyone in particular.  The ""idiot"" brother was not really funny, not really nice, not really anything that was worth watching.  I guess he was dumb, but it all felt forced and superficial.  The relationships between the people were all very shallow and forgettable (with the possible exception of the middle sister and guy next door?).  Key moments where interactions were supposed to matter were brushed over too quickly and handled without any depth.

I couldn't find much of an overall plot.  I think we were meant to root for the brother, but I just wished they'd lock him away and the movie would get on to something more interesting.  The hippie thing's been so overdone, it's hard to even know what to make of it anymore.  And while I liked the open-mindedness of the addition of bisexual and gay relationships, I didn't feel it really contributed anything to this movie in particular, it just made everything feel that even more forced and chaotic.

4471841,4,B004UXUWEC,"Paul Rudd is Ned. A biodynamic farmer who genuinely expects nothing but kindness from those he meets, Ned is affable to the Nth degree. He is so taken in by people that when a uniformed police officer asks him for marijuana and insists on paying for it, Ned (Rudd) is completely taken aback when said officer arrests him and sends him to jail for eight months.

  Upon his release he is evicted from his own property by the girlfriend who decided to dump him while he was in prison but never told him. In addition, she's decided to hang onto their dog out of sheer spite. And so Ned seeks shelter and assistance from his genuinely loving mother and his sisters who only help out of guilt and only until it becomes inconvenient for them. His sister Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) is a Vanity Fair journalist writing a profile on a member the royal family and half-heartedly involved with a neighbor who wants more but doesn't expect to get it. Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) is a bisexual ""performance artist"" living in a studio apartment with her girlfriend (Rashida Jones) and five other people. Liz (Emily Mortimer) is married to a documentary filmmaker (Steve Coogan) who shows no interest in maintaining their physical relationship and with whom she has a son who is being raised in a manner devoid of even the comic violence of The Pink Panther.

  As they all suffer various setbacks, the sisters seem intent on putting the blame for those setbacks on their brother despite the fact that those setbacks are the result of failings in their own character or the character of those around them. Ned is ostracized and, soon enough finds himself back in jail after revealing to his parole officer that he has violated the conditions of his release by smoking marijuana.

  Paul Rudd as Ned is a very endearing character. The sisters (Deschanel, Mortimer and Banks) are self-involved and less than endearing but their eventual growth and that of their relationship with Ned is enough to turn their roles in the story. There's no real redemption for the ex-girlfriend (played by Kathryn Hahn) but the shoe eventually ends up on the other foot. I really enjoyed this movie.",1326499200,3,2161,4.772117962466488

4471869,2,B004UXUWEC,"Obviously the people who made this movie couldn't decide what they wanted to make: (1) a mostly family-friendly movie about a man who is oddly naive (and oddly likeable) who goes through life making ridiculous choices that get him in trouble and whose sisters, unlike the rest of the population, don't think much of him.  Or (2) an edgy, adult comedy about the quirky sex lives and weird family dynamics of several sisters.  Just as I would start almost enjoying one movie, the other one would creep in and take over and I would have to adjust to that movie.  The part about the brother was funny in places, though not really all that engaging, but then these sex things would all of a sudden pop up for no discernable reason and I'd find myself losing the plot while I pondered what the point was in putting in this or that subplot.  And it's not that there were so many sex scenes, either, or that they showed much more than just kissing most of the time.  Just one now and then, when you didn't expect it.  I kept getting the sisters confused with each other, also, so it was hard to keep track as to who was having sex with whom.  However, I'm pretty confident that one brother-in-law was having some fun while he was supposed to be in a meeting (this one included some nudity), one sister is bi-sexual and possibly cheating on her lesbian live-in (two of the sisters looked a lot alike, so I had trouble knowing who I was seeing sometimes) and so on and so forth.  I got tired of trying to keep track of what was going on and realized that I didn't care how it ended.  I figured the brother would come out alright.  In spite of the title, he was the only one in the family with any brain cells, so far as I could see, and that is NOT a compliment to him or his family.  And I figured the sisters would either wake up to the fact that he's smarter than they are, or they wouldn't and I really didn't care which.  There was also some profanity, which nearly always turns me off, especially if there isn't any real reason for it.  If all this sounds intriguing to you; rent it or wait till you can get it a lot cheaper, but my advice is, skip it.",1325376000,3,2148,4.2481572481572485

4471871,4,B004UXUWEC,"I remember seeing the previews for this film and wondering how they were actually going to pull off an edgy, adult-themed comedy with a cast primarily filled with ladies. I mean, we've all seen Paul Rudd in his Judd Apatow comedies, slinging one amazing profane-laden zinger after another. He's become one of the constant's in the world of the ""Hard R"" comedies. And it felt like the previews were trying to push it in that direction. But that is not what this movie is-not by a long shot.

What it ended up being was a sweet, light-hearted drama with comedic elements. We watch as Paul Rudd's character tries to make his way through the world in his very innocent and well-meaning way. For his part, Rudd is absolutely fantastic and imbues the role with an utter sense of being genuine. Yes, there were times that his naivete and inability to see people as being bad was pushed a tad too far and stretched the imagination beyond its reasonable limits, leaving me rolling my eyes. But overall his portrayal was quite believable for the setting.

It's also to be commended that Rudd was loaded with such a talented supporting cast. Zooey Deschanel just keeps getting better and better. She and Elizabeth Banks play fantastic, world-weary counterpoints to Rudd's eternal optimist. The film is loaded with so many stars and each one turns in a well-rounded and never over-the-top performance.

I quickly came to realize that this was a film that my parents would probably enjoy far more than I, which is a surprise considering it's a Paul Rudd vehicle. But the man is versatile and has shown his acting chops time and again for the better part of two decades. This is definitely not for anyone looking to see another 40-Year Old Virgin or Superbad. This is lighthearted dramatic fun with nice touches of humor laced throughout in a story that's a bit of a heartwarmer.",1325203200,2,1865,4.7323076923076925

Nighty, night.",1324771200,3,311,4.571428571428571
4471873,5,B004UXUWEC,I love Paul Rudd.  This guy can do no wrong.  He should be a superstar.  He's probably underappreciated because he takes a lot of chances.  Instead of going the blockbuster route he takes off-the-wall parts in small disarming films like this one.  His Ned Rockland might be his most disarming and indelible screen role yet.  The film starts with Ned selling weed to a uniformed police officer.  After his release from prison circumstances lead him to live with his family.  Ned is a trusting soul who takes people at face value.  This trait is born more out of naivete then idiocy.  Each of his three sisters have built lives that are as precarious as a house of cards.  When Ned comes into their lives his blunt honesty causes the charades they've each devised to come tumbling down.  The results are both heartbreaking and heartwarming.  This is easily one of the funniest films of the year.,1324771200,4,893,4.683870967741935
4471874,4,B004UXUWEC,"This is a fluffy, fun little movie. Paul Rudd plays Ned, the sappy sweet naive ""idiot"" brother that acts likes he's deadened quite a few brain cells smoking pot. He is innocent, honest, and just wants to help - a dangerous combination when combined with three very different-thinking sisters.

If you're expecting something similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-40-Year-Old-Virgin-Unrated/dp/B002NWUBDY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 40-Year-Old Virgin (Unrated)</a>, you're going to be disappointed.  The humor is much subtler in this movie.  There's also family drama, romance, infidelity, the mandatory dog (actually two dogs) - and Ned just blithely tiptoes through the movie until you reach the end and realize - maybe he's not such an idiot after all.

I would consider this to be mostly a ""chick flick"" but there's enough humor and good-looking women that guys will enjoy it too.",1324598400,2,938,5.977611940298507

While you can find the plot and other details elsewhere, let me tell you why I think this movie just works. Ever since his supporting role in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knocked-Up/dp/B001CW7ZUS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knocked Up</a>&nbsp;P. Rudd in my opinion hasn't delivered a performance as deep as in this movie. What separates protagonists from supporting cast is depth in their character development. In this case that's what he does. He fleshes out a performance and underhandedly then some more. In my opinion he did what every good actor does: he plays an insightful idiot. This helps him navigate the story and deliver the range he does in this movie. I say stop reading, rent it or buy it and see for yourself.",1324166400,4,927,5.4
4471879,4,B004UXUWEC,"I wish more people in the world were like, Ned, ""the idiot brother."" Even with the great cast, I thought that this would be a typical gross-out comedy, using bathroom humor, raunchy jokes, and uncomfortable situations. Not that there is anything wrong with that humor; however, I was pleasantly surprised by the family nature of this of this movie. There were some ""naked"" humor moments, rest assured, but that is not what the movie was about.

Ned, is a trusting, nice man who loves his dog and his family. While not the brightest, he is good-hearted and has the best intentions. I enjoyed this movie and found myself laughing out loud. I was pleasantly surprised by this movie and recommend watching.",1323907200,4,702,4.801652892561983
4471880,4,B004UXUWEC,"I really like Paul Rudd, and my boyfriend really likes Zooey Deschanel, so....we kind of figured that even if this movie were terrible, we'd both at least be willing to sit through it. Luckily, it wasn't terrible at all (which, honestly, kind of surprised me), and we both really enjoyed it.

Paul Rudd plays ""the idiot brother"" -- a sweet and simple guy who isn't stupid, but whose unflagging belief in the goodness of the people around him sometimes leads him to do pretty stupid things. Honestly, the little blurb on the back of the case is a pretty good synopsis. Rudd is well-intentioned but somewhat naive, and while it leads to mixed results for him, it sometimes effs up the lives of the less well-intentioned folks around him, mostly his sisters. But, surprise surprise, eventually those around him come to see the benefits of living more in line with Rudd's philosophy.

So, the story is not earth-shattering or surprising, *but* the movie is genuinely sweet and genuinely funny. They achieve some of this funniness through various forms of vulgarity -- if not for this, it would probably be a pretty family-friendly movie, but then it also probably would have been rated PG and no one would want to see it. If you're not into vulgarity or explicit (if not graphic) sexuality, this may be enough to turn you off. If, however, you like a mix of ""human"" funniness and raunchy funniness, and you don't mind kind of fluffy feel-good stories, this is a good one.

4471881,4,B004UXUWEC,"The film starts with a hilarious scene of Ned agreeing to sell drugs to a policeman. He goes to prison for it, and is released to find his girlfriend has moved on and kept their dog and he no longer has a place to live. He is forced to look for shelter at his mom's and sister's, which take turns attempting to reform this peculiar guy. Not only is he extremely trusting and somewhat innocent, but he seems to have come without a filter when conversing, because he is stupidly honest in the most awkward situations. His strategy for living a peaceful life has been adopting a hippie and relaxed trouble-free existence, which has made him a sort of wandering soul living one day at a time, with no regard for the pressures of society.

The arrange of situations and the variety of characters made me overlook the lack of constant laugh I was expecting, and I ended up labeling in my head as more of a soft and smart comedy, that could be compared to Little Miss Sunshine. Which means, that instead of being just stupid meaningless laughs, it was more of a submerge into the out-of-the-ordinary family structures and dynamics that defy the accepted recipe that so commonly populate our society today. Something that is rarely explored outside of comedies. It made me relate and appreciate the movie much more.

My reaction to this movie was initially a tad negative just because of my expectations. Hollywood has forced upon us a series of romantic comedies and cruel laugh-out-loud ones, that influenced me to expect something along the lines of one of those two. But after digesting it a bit, I could see how my disappointment created by the lack of two-hour humor, had clouded my enjoyment of the rest of the components.

It's a very colorful, hopeful and spirited film, that lightly deals with strong mature issues, and brings out a little of the free-soul child we all have and would love to be, when seeing Ned. It made me think of how unnecessarily complicated we can make our lives to be, when there are other, more relaxed ways to go through life. And it also sends an implied message of acceptance into a society that, in my opinion, still needs it.

Overall, this is a very original and fresh film, with great acting, that represents America today and is very entertaining to watch.",1323734400,4,2291,4.635467980295567
4471882,4,B004UXUWEC,"Not nearly as broad and goofy as the film's title and advertising make it out to be, ""Our Idiot Brother"" is just a nice little comedy/drama (yes, there's actually some drama here), about Ned (Paul Rudd) a naive but open-hearted guy who shakes things up when he moves back in the vicinity of his three sisters after a stint in prison for committing a non-violent and truly idiotic crime.  The sisters (played by the talented and fetching Elizabeth Banks, Zooey Deschanel, and Emily Mortimer) all have their own problems- revolving around their jobs, families, and/or love lives- which become further complicated when Ned's antics are stirred into the mix.

Ned isn't truly an idiot, just a guy whose too-trusting nature often results in idiotic situations that gum up the works for him and, now that he's back home, his siblings.  Of course, Ned's personal craziness also illuminates the truly idiotic and crazy situations that his sisters have either created or tolerate in their own lives.  Does Ned, despite being eye-rollingly annoying most of the time, help nudge his sisters back on the right path?  And in return, do they help Ned free himself from his own eccentriciites and put him on more stable footing, too?  Unless you've never seen an American comedy/drama before, you'll see the ""yes"" answer to both of those questions coming from a mile away.

But that's okay.  With films like this one, it's the journey that counts, not the need for an unpredictable conclusion.  ""Our idiot Brother"" functions as perfectly fine cinematic comfort food, giving viewers exactly what they expect overall, but still peppering a handful of small surprises along the way (mostly in the laughs department).  I had a good time watching this at home one evening, and you probably would, too.",1323734400,4,1781,4.966329966329966
4471883,5,B004UXUWEC,"I have to admit that, before watching ""Our Idiot Brother,"" I was thinking that it would be a movie with the type of humor of ""The Hangover,"" ""The 40 year old Virgin,"" ""Bridesmaids,"" ""SuperBad"", ""Knocked Up,"" or along those lines. After all, Paul Rudd, who plays the main character in this film, has appeared in some of them. What I watched, instead, was a light, charming comedy, which left me with a nice smile at the end of the film. In other words, it is a feel-good movie, with a little twisted humor, that will conquer your heart.

Paul Rudd is Ned, a good-natured, nothing-worries-me kind of guy, who also happens to be quite nave in the ways of life. Right at the beginning of the movie, he is arrested for selling pot, trying to be good to be a cop. He is released after a while, and, penniless, goes to live with his girlfriend. Unfortunately for Ned, she now has a new boyfriend, and doesn't want anything to do with him. Ned then goes to live with his mother, who loves him, but things again don't work out for him. However, he has three sisters and he tries his luck by spending time in their homes. He moves in with Liz, who is married to Dylan (Steve Coogan), an obnoxious fellow that doesn't like Ned. Ned also tries living with Miranda (Elizabeth Banks), and her boyfriend Jeremy (Adam Scott), who likes Ned better than Dylan. Ned is also allowed to live with Natalie (Zooey Deschanel), who happens to be lesbian and shares an apartment with Cindy (Rashida Jones), where he is accepted by both. To his bad luck, and due to his naivet, Ned is too sincere in his statements when he opens his mouth, and gets people - his sisters included - in trouble. Add to this, all three sisters have different personalities and problems of their own, and you will have volatile and funny at times situation.

""Our Idiot Brother's"" main message, I think, comes with Ned himself. He believes in the good in everybody and always gives people the benefit of the doubt, thinking that they will reciprocate to his goodness. We all know that this is not the case in real life, but we would love it to be that way. The Blu-ray edition of the film includes commentary by director Jesse Peretz, deleted and extended scenes, and a making-of feature. (USA, 2011, color, 90 mins plus additional materials)

4471884,4,B004UXUWEC,"This movie surprised me, and that is always the best kind, although it doesn't say much about the marketing campaign for this film, which had made me think this would be more of a men-behaving-badly type comedy. Instead Paul Rudd is something of an innocent - a bohemian, good-hearted, trusting soul that never quite gets his act together partly because he gets stepped on quite a bit. He has three sisters, played by Elizabeth Banks, Zooey Deschanel, and Emily Mortimer, and after he gets out of jail for selling marijuana to a uniformed police officer (even knowing this in advance doesn't keep it from being funny) he stays with one after the other in succession, while trying to get back on his feet. In each case he complicates their lives by innocently telling the truth - truths they don't want to come out. Much family drama ensues. Throw in a hilarious boho-Buddhist ex-girlfriend and you have lots of quirky, character driven comedy.

The film doesn't have any plot beyond that - it's just day to day life as this family drama unfolds. It perhaps does have a message, in the form of the heart and integrity that Paul Rudd's character embodies, which serves as a kind of lightening rod for everyone around him. But not a lot of action, so if you are looking for a big climactic scene with car chases or interrupted weddings etc. you won't find it here. But if you appreciate smart writing and acting, and comedy based on character with a bit of heart, you will like this film.",1323648000,3,1485,4.625

4471909,2,B004UXUWEC,"There aren't many actors out there more inherently likable than Paul Rudd, it seems; he might come across a little smug from time to time, but just try to resist that adorable, guileless smile of his. Our Idiot Brother makes the most of this likability by casting Rudd in a role that requires him to be perpetually happy, unflinchingly credulous, and, therefore, more than a little nave. Ned is a simple farmer who believes strongly in the honest goodness of others; when an unlucky run-in with a cop gets him booted off the farm, he takes turns living with his three sisters, who all think he is, well, an idiot. Over time, the sisters, whose routine lives are stressful in their own right, begin to see that Ned's outlook on life isn't so idiotic after all. I enjoyed Our Idiot Brother well enough, Rudd's innocent charm in the title role is a big plus, even in the midst of the film's uneven tone, and see fit to give a 2 stars. It might be a little too cute and coy for some, but it also just might make you go, ""Awww, well isn?t that nice?""",1323475200,2,1045,4.364102564102564
4471910,5,B004UXUWEC,"Really, this movie is a simple morality play:  the problems come when the characters let shallow considerations get in the way of a simple, basic value.  Love, in this case (and truth, as the essential test of love).  But not ""love"" in the sense of a typical romantic comedy.  Love between brother and sister, sister and sister, uncle and nephew, partner and partner.  Man and dog.  It accomplishes absolutely everything a movie of its type could hope to accomplish -- thus, the 5 stars.

It's hard not to describe this movie in a way that doesn't sound cliche -- it is in a way following a well-trodden path.  But cliches be damned, this film is charming, and not for lack of a better description.  The movie is charming in all of the best senses of the word.  When you think of ""charming"" in the context of other films, the weakness of description is the fault of those other movies, not this one.  The characters are quirky ""types"" but they effectively convey that there is a little bit of each one in all of us -- the characters don't wind up feeling like stereotypes.  Instead, they feel real and totally sympathetic even though the comedy format doesn't attempt (or allow for) any sort of deep character development.  You wind up loving them, warts and all, without feeling like you were cheated by cheap tricks and empty shells -- not an easy task in the comedy genre.

The actors are wonderfully cast.  Paul Rudd is the ""idiot"" hippy brother, and he manages to somehow be totally endearing in the role while being (if this is even possible) almost understated in the role.  Zooey Deschanel is the new . . . well, Zooey Deschanel (fell in love with her in Elf before I ever knew her name).  Charming, beautiful, so authentically quirky, her offbeat comedic talent perfectly complements Rudd's low-key portrayal.  Elizabeth Banks is perfect as the climbing fashionista sister.  She reminded me of a less attention-demanding version of Parker Posey, with a similarly keen understanding of ironic comedy and timing (which I consider a very high compliment -- I love Parker Posey).  Emily Mortimer, the third sister, is overshadowed by her counterparts, but that's by design, and she totally fulfills the role -- there are only so many glory parts in any movie.  I don't know if it was intended as a Paul Rudd vehicle, but it comes across much more an an ensemble film, with each actor contributing significantly to its success.

This is not earth-shattering film-making, but it's a light comedy for crissake.  It's the kind of movie I can imagine seeing played over and over again on non-premium cable channels . . . and that I would be more than happy to watch again every couple of years when I was in the mood for something that could touch the heart without weighing it down.  I think this is an unheralded but possibly lasting gem.  Badly marketed (I at least was hesitant to rent it based on the marketing), but brilliantly cast and really well written.  Watch the movie -- you won't be disappointed.  Unless you are essentially mean spirited and possibly evil.",1323388800,4,3071,4.702247191011236
4471911,4,B004UXUWEC,"I was expecting Our Idiot Brother to be a hilarious comedy based on the previews, but after watching the movie it wasn't exactly ""hilarious.""  It had this quirky kind of humor and only one time did I truly belly laugh.  Unfortunately most people probably wouldn't find the scene nearly as amusing as I did because it took place in this ""steam tent"" where Paul Rudd's character, Ned, passes out.  It really made me laugh because I do hot yoga and I could totally relate to the feeling.

I was a bit dismayed with the title.  Ned isn't exactly an ""idiot.""  Instead, he assumes the best in people so if someone tells him something, as implausible as it may be, he's willing to trust that person even though it's clear that he thinks it's odd.  (Like when his brother-in-law is having an affair with the star of his documentary, but he's willing to believe the story the brother-in-law gave him even though the look on his face made it obvious that he didn't think it made sense.)  In another case he could totally help out his journalist sister, but doesn't because it's not the right thing to do.  Ned is just a good guy.  Not an idiot.

I rated the movie 4 stars because it's still an entertaining movie and makes for a good night in.  It's NOT 4 stars because it's some deep movie that will ever become a classic.",1323388800,,1313,4.425

This it does by further perpetuating the cultural meme of successful, savvy, sensible, or principled women versus their imbecilic, directionless male counterparts.  The residual memetic ""implant"" of this film, and scores of others like it, is the notion that women have evolved into creatures vastly superior to men, the latter of whom are still mired is their vestigial, knuckle-dragging ways.  This is also reflected in the manner in which men are often portrayed as feckless dullards in commercials and TV shows whenever a couple or family are involved.  This is clownish entertainment for the feeble-minded and those of you who find this sort of film amusing do nothing more than celebrate your own enslavement.",1323129600,10,931,5.145695364238411
4471914,4,B004UXUWEC,"Paul Rudd's very sweet and endearing comedy about a stoner who just likes living a happy life in our cynical and often cruel world is a welcome comedy in this recent era of gross-out blockbusters (many of which you can find Rudd in, courtest of Apatow).

Ned (Rudd) is an organic farmer who is just too nice. So nice that he readily sells marijuana to someone he KNOWS is a cop. Of course, he only accepted money from the officer because said policeman INSISTED on paying for it... Ned was just going to give it away.

That tells you the kind of person Ned is... nice to the point of stupidity.

Once he gets out of jail and on probation, he pretty much plays a game of round robin, living alternately with his three sisters who each have their own issues that Ned can't help but complicate. Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) is trying to track down a story that she could source Ned on... if only he would lie (which he won't). Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) is pregnant, normally something to celebrate if she weren't in a committed relationship with another woman (Rashida Jones), a fact which Ned can't keep to himself. And, finally, Liz (Emily Mortimer) is married to a frustrating git of a pseudo-artiste husband (played here brilliantly by Steve Coogan as the guy you love to hate) whom Ned finds out is cheating on her.

Jesse Peretz has put together a great cast that gels well in all of their roles and the movie only suffers here and there in terms of delivery, pacing and overall plotting.

I loved Katy Hahn and TJ Miller as Ned's ex and her new boyfriend respectively. It especially worked in the denouement when we finally find out Ned's fate in terms of life and love. TJ Miller usually annoys me as he's typecast as the jerk slacker in most of his other roles (She's Out of My League, Cloverfield), but he really settled into his part of overly-helpful Billy. Really, he's just another Ned in the world and, even though we only see him in a few scenes, it worked.

The main problem I had with the film was just how quickly the third act resolution occurs, when the sisters all finally have their ""duh"" moment and realize that Ned's way of looking at the world is better than theirs. It all felt rushed, as if the story focused too much on how Ned unintentionally knocks down their house of card lives and not enough on how they would have to put them back together.

Still there was a lot for me to love about this film. I'd recommend at least a rental, if not a purchase. It's definitely worth seeing for all the feel-good laughs to be had, even if there's nothing really laugh-out-loud until you get to the outtakes.",1323129600,29,2622,4.472803347280335

Even in the special featurettes, the actors all seemed to be doing someone (the director, their friend) a favor by being in this movie. It had its moments, but overall, this movie is a pretty big waste of time. I love all the actors in it too, which makes it an even bigger shame that it turned out this way. It fell flat, seemed to be poking fun at caricatures of people who don't exist (very very stereotypical ""hippie"" characters and ""hot slutty lesbian""--I know, sounds great, right? WRONG).

The movie itself is entertaining enough - it's a story about three sisters and their idiot brother.  It opens with the Paul Rudd as the brother, getting busted doing something really stupid - it's just that he meant well and he was trying to help a ""friend"".  He ends up in jail, and upon his release has to depend on his sisters to put him up while he's on parole.  Obviously, he exposes that they're more effed up than he is, but they're also so caught up they don't see it and - surprise - they each end up learning a life lesson from him.  Oh, and there's the thing with his ex and his dog.

I enjoyed the movie, but mostly for Rudd, who is pretty much perfect for the role.  The plot is thin and obvious, but it moves along and there are some good jokes about how ""trusting"" is often mistaken for ""stupid"".",1322956800,,991,4.23404255319149

I got caught up in the turn around though. I just couldn't go for it. Like any other movie, the characters all have their own particular points of view, and generally, there's a ""turn around moment,"" often the climax, where their point of view changes. So anyway, I found that moment in this movie to be lame which made the end of the movie rather unsatisfying.

I don't like chick flicks or mushy movies, and this was neither of those.

The movie wasn't laugh-out loud hilarious for the most part, but I found it thoroughly engrossing. I was entertained the entire movie. Paul Rudd amazes me with how incredibly adorable and loveable he manages to be in EVERY movie in completely different characters. His childishly irresponsible, carefree hippie attitude could EASILY have been frustratingly annoying but managed to be sweet and quirky instead. Some of the funniest scenes were between Paul Rudd and his hippie ex-girlfriend; ""Stop the violence, man! You're making me raise my voice!""

The characters were superb, from Elizabeth Banks as the driven, high-maintenance, bossy sister, to Emily Mortimer as the sweet, mousey, loving mommy-sister, to Zooey Deschanel as the wild, carefree, experimental sister with growing up to do. All of the characters (including Paul Rudd's) manage to grow throughout the movie. The only character who was a bit vague was Paul Rudd's mother played by Shirley Knight, an actress I love and therefore wanted to see more of.

This was definitely intended as a sweet, quirky, feel-good comedy and pulled it off quite well. I would definitely recommend this movie. The movie could probably have been PG-13 in my opinion. There is probably the one 3-some scene that pushed it into R but that was definitely one of the funniest scenes of the movie and nothing ""bad."" The movie allows you see through Ned's (Paul Rudd) eyes; a person who deeply believes in the best in people. Because of this, almost every character is loveable and has redeeming qualities.

It made me think more than I wanted and I laughed a lot less than I would have liked.  The first 75 minutes or so pretty much dragged.  I did enjoy the last 10 or so minutes.  At least it concluded okay.

This was the story of a very dysfunctional family.  There are 3 sisters, the brother, a mother, and the son of one of the sisters.  The little boy is the only normal one and his mother is trying her hardest to keep him from being that way.  The brother keeps wrecking havoc in his sisters' lives.

I'm gonna get this out of the way from the get go, I loved this movie. It's full of true to life situations that happen everyday lead with standout performances by some of Hollywood's best up-and-comers...and Paul Rudd. The way they approached the situations, the way you could see these characters flaws and cracks, and the way they presented a normal family life were all so well done that, at times, I found myself wondering what I would do in that situation.

Make no mistake, Our Idiot Brother is not the laugh riot it has been made out to be. Yes, it has some very funny parts and I did chuckle throughout, but it wasn't laugh out loud funny. I'm okay with this though. I like movies that portray real life objectively.

In my eyes, Ned isn't even an idiot per se. I think he just cares too much and trusts too easily. Idiot qualities? Sure. I found myself sympathizing with him more times than not. Therein lies the reason I probably enjoyed the movie so much...I have those same qualities. I found myself getting mad at his family for treating him so badly and being so quick to pawn him off on someone else or talk down to him for no reason. But that works. They don't understand why he is the way he is. Like I said earlier though, once they start to understand you see that guilt, those cracks, and you genuinely feel like they want to right the situation.

For everything we were promised through trailers and TV spots, Our Idiot Brother delivers something better, something with more substance and believability. The laughs are there though, and the acting is perfect from beginning to end. Highly reccommended.",1322870400,3,1716,4.508038585209003

The movie demonstrates that ""loserness"" depends on criteria that can be superficial or more meaningful.

The movie reveals the superficiality of our normal, automatic judgments about people.

The innocent brother could have been replaced with: the spunky kid, the grumpy grandfather, the in your face dog, and so on.  We like Paul Rudd and that's why we ordered the movie.

4471951,3,B004UXUWEC,"When I first saw the trailer for Our Idiot Brother Advertised, I was semi interested due to the cast. Honestly, the cast is great. Everyone has a very solid character and performance. I could not really relate too much to any of the characters because the stupidity was so over the top. There were no surprises and many situations were very clich. However when it comes to story, Our Idiot Brother is very lacking and just plain dumb.

Parts reminded me of Dumb and Dumber simply because Ned (Paul Rudd) says some really stupid things and cannot keep a secret. Ned is a very nice guy and quite easy to get along with. So easy that everyone tells him their secrets, and then he tells everyone else. It tried to be like Juno or Little Miss Sunshine or another cute indie film, however it failed miserably. At the end of the movie when the credits rolled, so did my eyes and I felt like I just wasted the past 90 minutes of my life on a film which I got nothing out of. There were are few time where I did chuckle, however the situations were so outrageous that I did not find it humorous, I found it stupid.

I have watched many new movies recently and this one is by far the worst. Our Idiot Brother tried to be something it's not, then tried to give you that warm ""heart in the right place"" movie feeling, which is also failed at. The cast is amazing and it seemed so close to being a funny flick, but I ended up feeling bad for Ned, and the rest of his family because of all their bad situations and horrible choices. Ned simply was honest with them.

Also, quick note; I was very disappointed with Zooey Deschanel. Zooey is my reason for getting out of bed in the morning. I hope one day her and I meet and we fall in love and run of into the sunset together. Anyway, I greatly like her acting and singing, however her role in this film was not a great one and I ended up judging her character and her as an actress for picking a role like this.

4471953,5,B004UXUWEC,"""Our Idiot Brother"" is a funny, engaging, and charming movie.

All of the characters are interesting and pretty well-rounded; and the story flows smoothly along. In many ways it is a meditation on innocence and the effects it has on and in a ""realistic"" world. Paul Rudd does a great job playing an overly easy-going character who is smarter than Forest Gump, yet no less charming for all his simplicity. It almost makes one think of Dostoevsky's main character in his novel, ""The Idiot.""

The morality of the film is modern, and so as Rudd's character finds his way in and out of situations that are morally ambiguous, the viewer finds certain value judgments being made on things such as the acceptability of homo-sexuality and casual drug-use being implied in the film. Other issues are dealt with more humorously, and the sense of a strong moral ethic is maintained by the film throughout.

The film succeeds well at capturing the tension between humor and seriousness, and revolves around Rudd's character and his three sisters whose lives he is thrown into after a certain mishap in his life. The film is then the progressive unpacking of these lives as people interact with his disarmingly sincere and incredibly bumbling simplicity.

 Unfortunately, Ned's sisters do not share his idealism.  Forced to take him in when he becomes homeless, they find that his honesty and positive attitude clashes with their personal lives.

Aspiring journalist Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) gets pissed at her brother when he refuses to help her get that ""big story,"" and bi-sexual Natalie  (Zooey Deschanel) is not too happy when he reveals to her partner (Rashida Jones) that she is pregnant.  Yet, despite the immediate mayhem that Ned's openness causes these three women, the ultimate result is a positive change in all of their lives.
