2156978,5,B00061Q9JE,"I have numerous Pilates workouts but Rael is the most thorough and knowledgeable instructor I have ever had the pleasure to work out with.  This is TRUE PILATES and not the ""McPilates"" of Winsor and the likes!  Although I have been doing pilates for a while, Rael has taught me better techniques for positions I thought I knew well.

I bought the 3 dvd set which came with the beginners 7 which has 7 main positions; intermediate 17 which has 17 and the advanced 27 with 27 positions.

Buy any/all that you can afford and you won't regret it.  Rael knows what mistakes you will make and cues perfectly - explaining in clear detail and demonstrating the right and wrong way to perform each position.

7 will be a challenge for anyone new to pilates but you will be learning with perfect form and this will give you a strong core and the knowledge to move on to 17 and 27.",1150329600,31,870,4.372670807453416
2156979,4,B00061Q9JE,"Beginners should start with RAEL PILATES SYSTEM 7, a survey of the seven basic Pilates positions essential for training. Beginners receive a thorough exploration in visual demonstration and words of how Pilates workouts and techniques are achieved.",1145404800,5,248,5.72972972972973
2156980,5,B00061Q9JE,"I have tried other Pilates beginning instructional videos and I must say this is by far the best one. Rael is obviously peerless as a expert and a master in his instruction. Each pose is broken down and really emphasizes where the attention and focus should be.  Even a novice like me can understand how to do Pilates correctly. I lost a belt size and five pounds after doing this workout for only three weeks. The workout starts with a gentle warm-up and continues into a very challenging workout for beginners, all in 25 minutes. The visual camera work and production (it says shot in High-Definition on the box) is in perfect sync with the instruction and is  any video I've tried. I am looking forward to starting the System 17 ( for intermediates) next week.",1143244800,9,763,4.602941176470588
2156981,4,B00061Q9JE,This is a great into. to exercise if you're out of shape.  If you're in shape go for the System 17!  This one is great for those of us who haven't been doing what we should have to keep ourselves fit.  A great starting place and something to build on so you don't get discouraged and quit.  I could do these right away without having my kids laugh at me (or show me they could do it and I couldn't:)),1137024000,11,400,3.9625
2156982,1,B00061Q9JE,"I bought Rael Pilates System 7 online without knowing much about pilates. I finally got the chance to use it today and while I was feeling the different movements I was being walked through and was getting into it and ""feeling the burn"" it suddenly stopped. It was at best a 10 or 15 minute work out. I then read the back of the DVD (something that had not been mentioned when I bought it) and it said that you needed to buy 2 other DVD's to get the rest of the workout.

I recommend pilates because like I said, I was definetly into the workout but I do NOT recommend this particular one. Spend the extra couple of bucks or you will regret it like I did!!",1126742400,10,656,4.125

8036481,5,B00061Q9JE,"Not only does this video offer two levels of exercise dependent on your skill level, but it is easy to understand with an aesthetically appealing background. Rael's voice is very soothing (yes, even my husband thinks so...not just a female thing) and his positivity is a wonderful and unexpected bonus! Not only do I feel physically looser and stronger after the video, I also feel cheerier : ) Thanks, Rael!",1426377600,,408,4.8428571428571425

8036484,4,B00061Q9JE,"A Pilates instructor that I worked with on Reformer recommended this to me.  This is the first of a three part series, the beginner one.  You could skip this one if you already have practiced Pilates for a time.  However, it's simple but not ""easy"" it is a really great start.  If you did only this basic, simple series, you would improve your posture, low back pain, and whittle your middle.  Rael is really inspiring without being annoying (no cheesy lines).  He's calm and focused and incredibly fit from this practice.  An affordable way to learn and practice ""real"" (Rael) Pilates.",1363392000,,586,4.742574257425742
8036485,3,B00061Q9JE,"i am a beginner in pilates with background in yoga. i have had a lot of injuries and have poor alignment which makes strengthening challenging. i like it that this is a very gentle system, which emphasizes a lot on form, which i believe is very important. i did expect it to be more advanced than what it is, but at the same time, i don't mind going from the very basics to make sure my alignment is correct.

some movements are basically yoga poses with different or not-so-different names.

here's the negative for me. and it is just a very personal thing. i don't know if it's just me, but is anyone creeped out by the way he touches the woman demonstrator? i'm all for hands-on instruction, but there's something really unecessarily sexual with a lot of unecessary stroking motions that he does on her. i'm a liberal person who is usually very comfortable with touch, and i love affectionate, touchy-feely people. so many of my friends are. i also believe that touch is very important in this kind of body work, and am usually the one snickering at others who have all kinds of hang-ups about it. but somehow what he does seem unprofessional, and, again, creepy to me. personally it is enough to be actually distracting for me. and maybe one thing leads to another, but i find his voice annoying and grating as well.

i also tend to get put off by self-advertising in exercise videos. there is a montage of him teaching, playing with his family on the beach, etc... *rolls eyes* like gandhi says, ""my life is my message."" your dvd is already your message-to teach. i'm not going to buy another series because you look great swinging your kid around with your pant legs rolled up in that montage, but how you well teach. you know? i'd rather just be able to get down to work without having to forward through all that stuff. this kind of egotism bothers me and strikes me as unnecessary advertising.

obviously i don't like the guy! maybe these negatives sound trivial enough for some. but it is important for me to like the instructor. i'd like to feel open to their energy and not having to have any resistance. this is not the case for me, unfortunately.

however, despite all this, i still may give the next system up a try. as i do find the exercises themselves helpful. i really wish that he didn't rub me the wrong way so much!",1230940800,8,2337,4.489411764705882
8036486,5,B00061Q9JE,"I bought the 3 pack but I have only done the System 7 so far.
The DVD has three options
1 - the workout
it's 25 minutes long of 7 basic pilates movements. Rael talks you through them, he knows you might lean into your arm so he warns you not to. He has a model and had clips of himself and it flows very smoothly. I am used to doing more hard core strennuous exercise but I have to say that doing these moves I really felt it and I really appreciate his dedication to good form. It is obvious he is the best at what he does

2 - a break down of each of the 7 movements, so u can click on each one and get walked through it. (so cool!)

3 - Interview with Rael, he talks about pilates, inspiring.

This is a great DVD. I got it because I need to work on my posture and my physical therapist recommended. I can't wait to move forward to the next DVDs 17 and 27.

8036487,5,B00061Q9JE,"Rael has the knowledge that most beginner videos lack.  I'm starting over from scratch, after a long time away, and was looking for a workout that had some real content.  While this is a video with only seven basic ""exercises"" the explanation on how to execute them is so important in Pilates, so this deserves a 5 star rating.  I will probably only need to use this particular video for another month before moving onto the next one in his system, but it will be great to have when I need a refresher course!  I look forward to doing more exercises but want to learn the correct way, and not rush through a program just to say I've done it!  Recommended for anyone looking for short, gentle and safe way to work out (especially beginner and older exercisers!)",1188950400,5,760,4.478260869565218
8036488,3,B00061Q9JE,"I had never tried Pliates before and I read alot of reviews for alot of different DVD's and decided on trying this DVD.  The first time I tried the DVD I was confused with the breathing instructions.  I gave up, ordered another DVD and tried that one.  This DVD, although I didn't have to try and understand the breathing instructions (none were given) was so fast that I could not keep up.  I went back and tried the Rael Pliates again and now I am hooked.  I have found this DVD to be a great teaching tool for the true Pilates beginner such as myself.  I never feel rushed, I can understand the movement and now I can understand the breathing.  It is definately a great DVD for the Pilates beginner and I highly recommend it!",1169078400,5,728,4.3088235294117645
8036489,5,B00061Q9JE,"This disc comes with a 5 min interview with Rael, comes in 5.1 sound, the music is not annoying & the director & producers have won golden globes, emmys, etc. for other tv shows. The workout is 25 min long.
Rael Isacowitz has been doing Pilates for 25 years, is one of the few who can perform the entire repertoire & teaches other pilates teachers. He has a masters in dance which shows in how he moves & speaks. He is very graceful when he moves, has a lot of charisma when he speaks & doens't miss anything when showing how to do the movements. He sees the body as a dancer & is amazing in knowing how the body responds to small differences in movements such as which way the palm should face.
The set is simple orange with Rael guiding & speaking with an in shape female in gym halter top & pants doing the movements on a pilates table. Rael tells you how to move, what to watch out for all while keeping perfect pace of always telling you when to inhale & exhale in charming manner that's never annoying. He also demonstrates the more advanced way of doing each movement w/perfect precision & grace, even the roll ups. The pace is relaxed to emphasis body awareness.
The movements are: breathing, pelvic curl/yoga bridge pose, lying spinal twist (knees tucked), chest lift (crunch), roll up (laying to sitting), spine stretch (sitting), both legs side lift (lying down), basic swan (yoga cobra/upward dog), cat/cow & child's pose relaxation.
Some of the moves I felt were easy as well, but the more advanced way was plenty challenge enough for me.
If you want to learn pilates from a real master & get true body awareness to avoid spams & muscle injury, get this dvd.

You can see trailers for his system 17 & 27 at collagevideo com & get more info at raelpilates com",1165276800,10,1771,4.449230769230769
