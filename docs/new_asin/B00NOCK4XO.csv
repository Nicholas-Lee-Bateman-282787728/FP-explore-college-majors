6674149,1,B00NOCK4XO,"This is just an awful, awful movie in so many ways.  It's like a precocious high school freshman got together with her friends and made a movie.  Just  idiotic and pretentious and self-important.  Plus some of the worst acting I've ever seen in a film.  The only reason this disaster somehow got made is that Clara Mamet is David Mamet's daughter.",1449100800,,347,4.622950819672131

6674151,2,B00NOCK4XO,"Considering the age of Clara Mamet, a very nicely done movie. However, a little weird and sorta ""Monty Pythonish"" in parts. Jared Gilman is a very talented actor (Moonrise Kingdon verifies that fact) but he is poorly directed here. Poor Bill Macy - not sure why he took on this role, but not every movie is an Oscar contender, I guess.",1422835200,,335,4.508196721311475

6674153,2,B00NOCK4XO,"It seems like a home spun Dada inspired film made by college students in the late 90's.
A lot of things are random and the story line and script do not make sense.",1420243200,,163,3.9696969696969697

6674155,5,B00NOCK4XO,"Clara Mamet wrote, directed, and starred in this quirky indie comedy. Maude (Mamet) is a depressed dead-pan teen who broods about life. She has a very active imagination, which is presented to us, and lives with a dysfunctional family. Dad (William H. Macy) reads books while laying under the furniture. Her younger brother (Jared Gilman)  has 10 slices of toast for breakfast and looks at life as if he had a camera. Mom (Rebecca Pidgeon-real life mom too) is totally clueless about life as she says, ""It's college. I wonder what they do there?""

The setting for the film appears to be  circa 70's  plus or minus a decade. In order to appreciate this film, you must pay attention to the dialogue as well as the background setting as it all circles back. The meaning of the title is explained near the end of the film. Her best friend is Jenny. played by Ella Dershowitz, another celebrity child.

It is the type of film you would want to watch twice to pick up stuff you missed the first time. Great first effort in this semi-biographical tale.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1419033600,4,1079,4.59375
6674156,5,B00NOCK4XO,"Claire Mamet has undoubtedly picked up her father's talent for writing, directing and acting and is quite impressive in this truly ridiculous creation! Audiences will love her and even love to ""hate"" her at times, but this is an interesting movie from beginning until the end. William H. Macy and (one of my favorites) David Paymer were perfect additions to this insane (and sometimes inane) cast!",1418256000,,397,5.03030303030303
8679489,1,B00NOCK4XO,"Awful awful awful awful. It looks like a high school freshman wrote it, directed it and edited it. The professional actors who agreed to be in this sophomoric mess must have owed Mamet a favor.",1484956800,,193,4.542857142857143

8679491,2,B00NOCK4XO,"The best part - She finally tosses her cigarettes.  WAY too much smoking.  She has some nice perspective at the end, seeing a broader view of her actions and acknowledging her own mistakes.  That's really nice.  Some of the dialogue was fun.  I generally enjoy watching Mamet.  It's like a cool throw back to the 70s.  She has a very natural style.

I think the directing/acting was suited to the tone of the movie - it did maintain it's tone well - but the acting overall was mediocre.  Mamet clearly wrote to her strengths - dry humor.  It's a shame she didn't challenge herself as an actress.  The dialogue is too long winded.  A good editor would have chopped it up more, better cinematography could have helped as well - more cuts, better angles to add at least some visual interest during the bland points

As far as story, it's absurd to think the character would undergo such a dramatic transformation simply at ""discovering"" she is a writer.  The choice not to go to college yet to try to be a writer - well, it's a Hollywood film.  I guess they can afford to live in the fantasy that college wouldn't vastly improve her writing.  But that's all it is - fantasy, as evidenced by the average screenplay.  I think the gross attorney summed it up - she has talent, but she's young and the adults in her life clearly aren't tutoring her as well as they should, unless we assume they are all mediocre talents themselves.  The climax of the film was brought on by the F word.  Seriously.  The emotional climax is when she is cursing at her therapist.  I guess that's all it takes considering the overall lack of emotion and self-absorption of all of the characters.

If this were written by an adult, I'd say more, but I'm taking it in context.  This came after The Neighbors was ended, so the love story Maude comes up with is really funny given that broader context of Mamet's life.  Whether it's really related or not.... well, I don't care enough to research timelines.  A much better film called Hotel Sorrento actually brings up the question of whether or not woman are capable of writing anything that isn't somewhat autobiographical.  An interesting question here.  The fetal father always sleeping in tight, dark places.  The artistic mother who is self-absorbed.  And yet, as long as they acknowledge their daughter's artistry everything is okay, that's all that matters in her life, in her character, etc..  I really don't like films that deify the artist.  Unfortunately, that's my biggest take away from this film, not explicitly, but given the tone, the style, etc., it pays much to much homage to the artist.  So for that particular theme: Puke.",1472947200,,2663,4.648068669527897

8679494,2,B00NOCK4XO,I can't say I hated it because I didn't watch it thru to the end.  But I couldn't get past the first 15 minutes.  It was excruciating and painfully slow.  All lot of off beat weird dark humor that didn't fit.  Not my type of movie,1465862400,,230,3.9347826086956523
