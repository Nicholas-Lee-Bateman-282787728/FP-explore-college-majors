She loves it!",1482278400,,61,4.166666666666667

8436405,2,B004N53D7K,I was disappointed in the quality of the DVD.  The VHS tapes were better quality than this.  Very grainy and blurry (both movies).  I would not recommend this.,1426464000,,159,4.607142857142857

8436408,5,B004N53D7K,"Whether you're a Shirley Temple fan because you grew up during her ""peak"" popularity, or because your mother or grandmother introduced you, people of all ages can appreciate this dvd containing Curly Top & Dimples.  The Shirley Temple movie tradition has been passed onto its 4th generation in my family, which speaks to the timelessness.  While there are limitations to how much the original movie quality can be enhanced, it is appreciated that you can still buy her movies in the latest media format.  My little niece of 3 years loves these movies (whether we have it on the color or black & white setting) and to sing and dance around like Shirley.",1400198400,,652,4.752212389380531
8436409,5,B004N53D7K,"I simply love Shirley Temple movies so ordering this was an easy sell for me. I love having her movies on DVD and I am trying to purchase as many different titles as I can.  My grandchildren enjoy them and it gives me an excuse to watch Shirley Temple movies (not that I need one). For me Shirley Temple movies are a time honored classic that I will always enjoy watching. I loved how the secure envelope this movie(s) arrived in was decorated with smiley faces and little messages. A little gift pack of bubble gum was included, lol and I thought how sweet!",1342742400,2,558,4.365384615384615
