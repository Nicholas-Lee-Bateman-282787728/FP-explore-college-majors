8286297,4,B001C9FQGG,"Tsui Hark's debut, The Butterfly Murders is one of those impossible to find films that seemed to exist only as a glowing reputation, so it's a surprise to find out that it's a highly enjoyable Hong Kong fantasy thriller that's surprisingly original. It's plot-led (there's very little action at all in the first half-hour) and comes with lashings of dark atmosphere, even managing to make its premise of killer butterflies work surprisingly well, and it makes good use of Goldsmith's Planet of the Apes score, pilfered alongside Morricone's Moses for the occasion (about the only genuinely original cue is a funky Meko-esque disco title song!). Oh, and it has a very cool suit of black armor that any of the villains in Mad Max would kill for.

Mei Ah's remastered DVD shows up more than a few problems with the neg - there's a lot of water damage leading to noticeable yellow splotches in some scenes (mostly noticeable in the few daylight sequences) and the sound hums a bit - but it's still probably the best version available, with an otherwise decent 2.35 widescreen transfer.",1229299200,3,1081,4.8432432432432435
