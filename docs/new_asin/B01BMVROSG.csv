7664357,5,B01BMVROSG,"Yet another excellent entry in ESPN's 30 for 30 series, this time chronicling the Buffalo Bills team of the 1990s who made and lost 4 straight Super Bowls. Having grown up watching football during this time, I really enjoyed this particular episode b/c not only does it chronicle the 4 time AFC Champion Buffalo Bills but also a lot of other great NFL teams of the time (Cowboys, Giants, Redskins, etc.) and finally gives this unique Bills team the respect and historical perspective they deserve. I'm a lifelong Cowboys fan and to see what the Bills fans endured having their Super Bowls dreams dashed 4 times in a row, really makes me realize how spoiled us Cowboys fans truly are and how all fans from all teams could take a cue from the unwavering loyalty and support that the Bills fans provide. Also even more compelling, seeing what some of the former Bills players (mainly Jim Kelly) have also endured in their personal lives helps you simultaneously appreciate their inner strength while further appreciating that there are much more significant things in life than your job. You don't have to be a fan of the Bills to appreciate this documentary, fans of the NFL and sports in general will appreciate it and hopefully gain some appreciation and admiration for what this team was able to accomplish.",1472774400,9,1308,4.792035398230088

7664361,5,B01BMVROSG,"The four falls of Buffalo is another very interesting documentary about the great Buffalo Bills teams of the early 1990s who made it to 4 consecutive Superbowls in a row only to lose each one.  Only the Vikings have been to that many and failed to win one.

The Bills have never really recovered since they made it to that last Superbowl, besides the Music City Miracle game (Which they lost) I cannot remember the Bills making the playoffs for over a decade.

Make no mistake these were exceptional teams and several of the star players rightfully belong in the NFL HOF despite not winning the big game.  Watching Thurman Thomas in this movie you are reminded how awesome he was as a running back.  Jim Kelly went to the USFL and wanted to play anywhere but in Buffalo until he actually started to play there and have success.  Bruce Smith was easily one of the premier defensive players in the league.  Andre Reed made spectacular plays look easy like Jerry Rice.  I had forgot than Don Beebe was traded to the Packers at the end of his career and on the 5th try he finally won the Superbowl on that Brett Farve Packers team under Mike Holmgren.

The documentary is very good whether you like the Bills or not.  It gives you an insight into the NFL during that time period.  I did not remember that the Bills handily beat the Giants toward the end of the 1990 season only to lose to them in the Superbowl.  Same with the Cowboys during the 1994 season the Bills beat the Cowboys only to get stomped on in the Super bowl against them again.
A lot of those Superbowl losses fall on the coach as well as the players.

XXV

Bill Parcels outcoached Marv Levy in Superbowl 25.  The Giants game plan was pretty simple don't get beat by the K-Gun offensive.  The Giants moved back the safeties, corners and linebackers preventing any big pass gains.  The Giants were inviting the Bills to run the ball right at them and they didn't do it.  Granted that Giants team had one of the best defensives in the league and some dude named Lawrence Taylor.  The game was exciting and set up one of the best finishes in Superbowl history Scott Norwoods kick that sailed wide right.

XXVI

Defensive Coordinator for the Bills Chuck Dickerson made some stupid comments about the Washington O-line which was full of quality players.  Nothing like a little incentive to fire up the opposing  team.  I found it fascinating that Thurman Thomas couldn't find his helmet and several of the plays that were designed for him were not executed because he was not in the game.  Jim Kellys 4 interceptions really cost the Bills in this game.  The only points the Bills were able to score were in garbage time late in the game when the fate of the game was already decided.  Don Beebe and Reed both dropped passes in this game that could have really changed the outcome.

XXVII

The Cowboys just flat out steamrolled the Bills in this one.  With Jim Kellys early injury nothing seemed to go right for the Bills.  Granted that Cowboys team was loaded in every area, offense, defense and special teams.  All the fumbles and interceptions by the Cowboys sealed the game, by halftime the game was already over.

XXVIII

In the Bills final trip to the Superbowl they outplayed the Cowboys during the first half, but failed to score a touchdown on the final possession before halftime.  Troy Aikman pointed out that he saw a look of defeat on the Bills players faces as they walked off the field, they were not excited or jazzed about being ahead at halftime like they should have been.  Once again fate frowned on the Bills and the Cowboys dominated the second half of the game.

Overall the documentary is a very good film.  I didn't know that the next year Scott Norwood didn't miss a single kick the whole year even in the playoffs.  I also didn't know how good his teammates acted so professional after he missed the kick that lost them the game.  It goes to show that these were a unique group of guys.  I think the documentary is 4  star film.",1462320000,2,4013,4.4937759336099585

8750730,4,B01BMVROSG,"Triumph and tragedy with the Buffalo Bills, four time conference champion and four time Super Bowl loser. Buffalo's story is one of perseverance, of epic highs and humbling lows, the forge of many a rich human character.

Starting quarterback Jim Kelly is a prime example, a hot-headed kid who joked at the city's expense before jilting them for a rival league after the draft. During his early years in the NFL he was a petulant prima donna, throwing teammates under the bus and running his mouth at press events. The adversity of four straight bitter pills changed him, though, steeled him, prepared him for what trials his life held in store after his career was through. Scott Norwood, whose errant kick spoiled the team's first championship try, lives every day with the guilt of that one defining misfire. He also wells up with pride in reliving the days immediately after the game, when the community taught him lessons in compassion and forgiveness.

These teams are rife with such stories, of morals wrenched from each player's deepest disappointment. It's a bittersweet tale - of course there's no Hollywood ending - but also a resonant lesson in humility, acceptance and personal growth.",1537401600,,1198,4.985

To all sports fans, it is a compelling story that you wonder ""how the heck did they hold it all together?"" For 4 straight years they won the AFC Championship. Never before done, will never be repeated. They just faced four equally or superiorly strong teams that got the better of them.
