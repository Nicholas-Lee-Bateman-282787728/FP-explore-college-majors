2163565,5,B00062IYYQ,"Spencer Williams had he not played Andy on ""Amos'n'Andy"" in the shirt-lived television series of the early 1950s might have been recognized for pioneering sound in motion pictures and producing, dricting and acting in African-American films made for a black audience. Like Ed Wood and John Waters, he worked on a show-string budget and hard a difficult time finding a distributor for his films. He should have had a Star on the Walk of Fame in Hollywood, California! See and enjoy these and bring a large bucket of buttered popcorn, a tall glass of sodapop and kick back and enjoy the film!",1353974400,,590,4.794117647058823
2163566,2,B00062IYYQ,"I thought I would try out and see how these great men came to live in a nation so one sided. The actors do or seem not to put their soul into it. It does not matter if it is a B-cut movie or a major class movie, i am sure there could of been better actors who can really show the love and detail in playing a roll to make the movie more Life Like in the real world. over all 1 to 10, 10 being the est and 1 the worst, I have to give it a 4.8.....Just cause it is not something i would just stick in for a movie, I am gong to keep the movie in my collection of westerns i have already been building for over a decade. thanks al'",1302998400,,627,3.6176470588235294

2163569,3,B00062IYYQ,"""Race movies,"" a genre unique to the United States between 1915 and 1947, were quite popular with black Southern audiences and in Northern industrial cities that had large African American communities. After the successful legal desegregation of the film industry in 1948, this type of movie vanished, literally. Today, only a fifth of the original 500 race films still exist.

SYNOPSES:

""Big Timers"" - This musical short tells the story of a poor girl and her mother who don't want her well-to-do suitor to know of her humble status.

""Dirty Gertie From Harlem USA"" - A Harlem club dancer hides from her backer/boyfriend in the Caribbean, where her seductive stage manner makes her a sensation at a local resort.

""Harlem Rides the Range"" - A typical 'B' western with all the standard elements. There's a struggle over a radium mine, a frame-up, an escape, and of course, some music. Singing cowboy Herb Jeffries is accompanied here by the Four Tones and the Four Blackbirds.

""Moon Over Harlem"" - Fragments of this movie have been lost, so it suffers a bit from lack of continuity. It's the story of a woman and daughter who fall victim to her new husband, a gangster with no redeeming qualities. While stealing from his bride the man lusts after his step-daughter.

2163587,4,B00062IYYQ,"""Race movies"" bring us some of the most valuable footage of outstanding African-American performers who were otherwise ignored by the major studios, even as ""box-office-worthy"" subjects for the ""B"" pictures that comprised many of the double features of the '30s and '40s.  Commodore Records, which released Billie Holiday's ""Strange Fruit,"" when Columbia refused to do so, was a small ""race label.""  Alfred Lion's legendary Blue Note Records, which produced some of the most important, soulful jazz of the 1950s, was a company dedicated to releasing ""race records,"" or recordings by black jazz artists playing largely to the black community.  When an artist attracted a sizeable audience, one representing a broad cross-section of the American public, performers such as Miles Davis and Jimmy Smith quickly jumped on the bandwagon of the companies--Columbia, Verve, RCA--with the greatest circulation and the richest returns.  As a result, shortly after the mid-'60s, Blue Note went bankrupt.

Race Movies seemed to go into a rapid decline in the '40s, though their disappearance leaves open to speculation and debate the cinematic fare that replaced them with black audiences.  Certainly, ""black cowboy movies"" were a phenomenon of the 1930s.  Spencer Williams appearx to have been the key figure in their success, briefly replicating that of the major studios (""Westerns"" remained the most popular genre with white America from John Ford's ""Stagecoach"" (1939) to the long-running ""Gunsmoke,"" which drew higher ratings than any other television program until the present millennium.  Herb Jeffries is perhaps best thought of as the ""black John Wayne"" of this unique sub-genre while Stepin Fetchit was the clownish side-kick, the ""black Andy Devine"" of the genre.

There's little about the script, the filmmaking, or the acting to recommend any of these four films, yet each proves fascinating to the viewer who is interested in yet another ""representation"" of the Wild West (as many of us finally learned, John Ford's version was far from accurate).  Moreover, the films are equally entertaining and instructive to the viewer who brings to them a historical perspective and a genuine curiosity about the way black America interpreted and saw white American as revealed in the films.  In general, I'd have to give the films an ""A"" for their treatment of women.  They're still marginal in the frame, but when spoken about or given dialog, they're treated with restraint and respect. (I realize some would argue that the ""femme fatales"" of film noir, though villains, are complex characters who reveal, more than anything else, males' insecurity and fear around women.  The same was no doubt true for black males, though at this stage it's only males' respectful deference toward the other sex that is allowed to be shown.)

Don't expect HD quality or gripping drama, and your chances of enjoying these films (which I have yet to see on any television channel) are all the greater.  Moreover, you should know that Herb Jeffries went on to success as a vocalist in the Duke Ellington Orchestra (""Flamingo,"" 1941), then married burlesque queen ""Tempest Storm, then appeared in a movie with Angie Dickenson, and as far as I know is still riding the range at the ripe young age of 100 years.  The obscurity of his story practically speaks for itself.  Why hasn't white America gotten hip to his truly amazing life and career?  At the fairly least, the man deserves a biopic if not a postage stamp.",1375056000,6,3491,5.1486725663716815
2163588,3,B00062IYYQ,"The production values of these films are so low as to be essentially unwatchable.  They appear to have been copied directly from the source material..and the introduction goes so far as to apologize for it's poor condition. There were many jump-cuts (intentional or not) that seriously ravaged continuity..if, indeed the plotline followed any predictable pattern at all.  I wonder if the American Film Institute ever gave any consideration to salvaging these films, if only to maintain some semblance of history from the genre of storytelling..

I bought several of these DVDs to gain some insight into the mindset of the era.  Even at the reduced cost, these movies were greatly overpriced!",1373846400,,691,5.198198198198198

It also revealed the religious inspiration of Southern Women of the time.  This movie was out of sorts a bit because Madam Curie and her husband only got a film of radium out of a few rooms full of pitch blend ore.  The pitch blend ore was what was left for mining the silver ore.  .",1489881600,,457,4.255813953488372
