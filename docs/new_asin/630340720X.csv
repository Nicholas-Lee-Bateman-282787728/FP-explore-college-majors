639032,5,630340720X,"This is a brilliant adaptation of the classic book by Robert A. Heinlein. It is much better than the adaptation of ""StarShip Troopers"" staying closer to the story line and adapted well to the current state of  technology. The minor differences between  the book and the movie are well  thought out and add, rather than detract from the story. My only regret is  that it couldn't be adapted closer, ie: that the entire midwest, central  Canada and Mexico  as well as unknown parts of the USSR are infested (after  the initial landing). The actors are well chosen and Donald Sutherland is  the crusty head of the 'Agency', Dr. Niven, plays the part almost as a twin  to the description in the book. All in all,  a well done thriller with the  minimum amount of blood and gore, more thought provoking than the usual  Sci-Fi invader story.",924393600,11,835,4.6438356164383565

639143,4,630340720X,"The book of the same name, written by Robert A. Heinlein, was published in 1951.  It was meant to be futuristic, taking place in 2007.  The ""slugs"" came from Titan.  The movie version tried to be as faithful as it could be considering the number of rewrites Disney forced Terry Rossio & Ted Elliott to make.  The Disney executives wanted a movie that would make them a ton of money.
The story involves an invasion by parasites that attach themselves to people.  They hope to conquer the world but forgot to factor in the possibility that we, as a whole, are rather germy.  Jack Finney's novel The Body Snatchers (1954) follows a similar line of thought but spawned more film versions.

I like this movie in spite of the casting of one-note Sutherland.

639150,5,630340720X,"Based upon the Heinlein novel of the same name written in 1951.  My dad made me read it when i was 10.  Fantastic book. The movie? well what's not to like? Due to differences of opinion between the script writers, don't remember their names, a few things from the book never made it to the screen.  Happens a lot but some movies overcome that and this one does.  Sutherland has always been a favorite of mine since The Dirty Dozen.  He excels here as the no nonsense 'old man' leading a team of government officials on the trail of an alien invader. His son(EricThal) co- leads the investigation.  Superb acting all around (Thal's and Warner's performances of being possessed by the alien are darn good)  even a cameo from comedian Richard Belzer wasn't to stilted.

639186,4,630340720X,"Note: There may be a spoiler here, not sure, but read on anyway, if you choose. This movie was enjoyable, though mainly predictable. It is not a great movie by any stretch. The alien predators were well done and creepy enough to keep interest, but one can't help but wonder (?) if the idea was stolen from the ""Alien"" series of movies where the alien ""birthed"" from the chest. This one didn't birth from the chest, but rather latched on to the back of its chosen host. The prong part of the alien penetrated into the back of the neck, where it could infiltrate (and read) the mind of its host, hence the ""puppet master"" theme. Although the movie didn't actually go there, I couldn't help my own mind making a connection with the reptilian brain in humans, as it seems that when the afflicted began behaving in a more reptilian, cold blooded way, losing the higher human qualities of good will toward others, empathy and compassion. As usual, Donald Sutherland was great in his role; the others were okay.",1397952000,,1004,4.583333333333333
639187,4,630340720X,"A satisfying sci-fi romp mixing ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" with Roger Corman's ""It Conquered the World"" with a dash of Dustin Hoffman's ""Outbreak"" thrown in.

Alien invaders, this time hubcap-sized parasites that have a nasty whip-like proboscis that finds its way into the victim's brain, invade earth so they can live conveniently off their hosts.  Donald Sutherland (himself a lead in one of the actual ""Invasion of the Body Snatcher"" iterations) heads a small deep cover government anti-alien task force to terminate the baddies.  Good moments of guessing who's infected with more than the usual amount of testosterone thrown in make this a tame 'R' experience for today--it would likely garner a PG-13 rating now.

I saw this in theaters back in the day.  Holds up well and translates nicely to the small screen.",1397606400,2,823,5.066666666666666
639188,3,630340720X,"This late entry to the paranoid the enemy within aspect of science fiction films is an anachronism in that it is based on a book that started the alien symbiotic-parasite phenomena in science fiction back in 1951, but then was copied by other films such as Fiend Without a Face, The Brain Eaters, and many others. It was until 1994 that a film was titled The Puppet Masters was made and credit given to Robert A. Heinlein, after all those other unauthorized rip offs. It has been decades since I read the novel, but I remember that the Nivens family of the scientist intelligence division had an incestuous relationship, and they were a twisted, perverse type of family that were in a position to save the world from aliens. This survives in the film in the father-son relationship tension, but in the book the Mary character was a sister, not someone brought in from NASA. The Walt Disney Company had delete the incest factor of the heroes, but heroes with problems of their own often make more interesting characters. By 1994 the idea of the enemy within had been film too often for it to be an interesting idea. Also the idea of Communism as a beatific hive-mind commune (which is what the aliens wanted to create) as something evil is too late. I suspect Heinlein hated the hippie ideology of communes and all is one thinking. For this film (the book more so) emphasizes the libertarian hyper-individualism that is so American.  This film itself is an exercise in paranoia, that our individuality is taken from us and we join a telepathic collective, and such an idea is evil. The film stretches out too long, is violent, militaristic, and casually destructive, all hallmarks of a Hollywood action film. It tries to make a horror film from the idea of an alien symbiosis, and so comes off as a relic and ridiculous. But then, there are right-wingers who think communes are evil and wicked. A horror film for the hyper- individualists, a joke for those who lived through the hippie times of the sixties.",1396051200,,2006,4.682719546742209

Any time a book is transformed into a movie often book readers are left disappointed. This is a great SyFy film. The acting isn't ""wooden"" it is just simplified because the characters in this story are not emotional people. They are serious and always mean business.

639236,5,630340720X,"The Puppet Masters is quite the excellent sci-fi movie with an alien theme.

This film has absolutely *zero* flaws.  It's about a group of people who investigate a sighting in the woods where aliens make a surprise landing.  From there, the storyline kicks in.

It turns out these aliens are not your typical big-eyed creatures that many people associate with the word ""alien"".  Instead, these particular type of aliens are tiny stingray-looking, blood sucking creatures that attach themselves to peoples backs.  When this happens, the aliens then completely take control of the human, and to add to the suspense, their personality changes as well.

It then becomes a suspenseful adventure figuring out which people contain the aliens, and who will be saved.  In order to find out, the person has to take their shirt off to reveal the alien so action can be taken.  Obviously if an alien IS controlling them, they won't take their shirt off willingly.

Julie Warner was quite the attractive woman for this film.  I completely forgot about her as an actress.  She does a great job in this performance.  Donald Sutherland is an actor I never really paid a whole lot of attention to until I became a fan of his son Kiefer from the hit TV show 24.  I certainly see some similarities between Donald and his son.  Every once in a while the two of them will share similar facial expressions.

Anyway, the Puppet Masters is a really good film about aliens.  In all honesty it's not a particularly scary movie- just a really good action film with the occasional startles and screams.  I highly recommend it to all alien lovers.",1286150400,,1618,4.758992805755396

639287,3,630340720X,"Robert Heinlein's ""Puppet Masters"" is a classic chunk of sci-fi... so inevitably it got semi-mauled by the movie industry.

And the movie adaptation is sort of a half-and-half affair. Stuart Orme manages to maintain an intelligent, genuinely creepy atmosphere throughout the first half of the movie, only to spend the second half gleefully throwing in lots of gun battles, chases and really atrocious acting by Eric Thal.

Government agency head Andrew Nivens (Donald Sutherland), his agent son Sam (Thal) and NASA exobiologist Mary Sefton (Julie Warner) arrive in a small Iowa town to investigate a UFO hoax.

But they soon learn that it's no hoax -- the town has been infected by body-snatching alien manta rays (which would make an awesome band name), and they accidentally bring one back to Washington. The aliens are spreading through Iowa and Washington, they're strong nd smart, and there's almost no way of getting one off without the host dying.

And to make matters worse, Sam is even briefly infected with one, which almost leads to the president being possessed. With only a matter of days before the entire Earth is overrun, Our Hero leads a special military team to.... rescue his love interest. Oh yeah, and maybe save the world while they're at it, if he stumbles across the solution.

""The Puppet Masters"" is a true classic -- it spawned ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" ""The Faculty"" and even a ""Star Trek"" episode. It's a pretty intelligent look at the societal changes that might come from alien parasites, and ""The Puppet Masters"" sticks to that for quite some time.

In fact, the first two-thirds of the movie are a pretty faithful adaptation of Heinlein's novel, with plenty of haunting suspense and scientific exploration. It's an atmosphere where nobody can be trusted, and anyone who attempts to stop the aliens will become their new slaves. There are some truly harrowing glimpses of what the aliens do to people, and creepy moments galore (such as the ""Do you miss me?"" message from a posessed chimp).

Unfortunately about halfway through, Stuart Orme decides to throw in a cliche damsel-in-distress story, with the required gun battles and airborne wrestling matches. And it's riddled with fairly obvious plot-holes (why don't people go shirtless to show they're not possessed?) that leave you wondering how such stupid people got into uber-powerful government agencies.

And the cast is a very mixed bag -- Donald Sutherland is simply brilliant as Niven, exuding a sort of stern paternal feel, while being willing to do whatever it takes to save the world. We never find out why his son loathes him, though. Warner does a decent job despite being nothing more than the Required Love Interest for the main character, and Keith Warner is quite good as Sam's military sidekick.

Eric Thal is a total disappointment, though. His acting is embarrassingly bad in any scene that requires major emotion -- which he usually conveys by twitching and opening his mouth. He seems to have been hired mainly for his oft-displayed hot body, including the worst post-trauma shower scene I've ever suffered through. Seriously, it's basically an excuse for Thal to slither around naked on the tiles.

""The Puppet Masters"" starts and proceeds as a smart, eerie sci-fi thriller, but starts deteriorating into another dumb Hollywood blockbuster by the last lap. At least Sutherland keeps things worthwhile.",1238976000,,3416,5.062277580071174

639291,4,630340720X,"It's probably worthwhile to mention that I have not had an opportunity to read the source material, in this case a novel by Robert A. Heinlein published in the early 1950s, that the film The Puppet Masters (1994) was based on, so I can't speak towards what made it into the movie and what didn't...co-written by Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio (both of whom worked on films like Small Soldiers, Shrek, and Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl), and David S. Goyer (Dark City, Blade, Batman Begins) and directed by Stuart Orme, the film stars Donald Sutherland (Animal House, Space Cowboys, Cold Mountain), Eric Thal (A Stranger Among Us, Six Degrees of Separation), and Julie Warner (Doc Hollywood, Tommy Boy).  Also appearing is Keith David (They Live, The Quick and the Dead), Will Patton (Armageddon, Remember the Titans), Richard Belzer (""Homicide: Life on the Street""), and Yaphet Kotto (Truck Turner, Alien).

The film begins as we witness a strange phenomenon in the sky in a small, midwestern town, drawing the attention of a number of slack jawed yokels.  Shortly afterwards some gooberment people show up, namely Andrew Nivens (Sutherland), head of a secret agency called the Office of Scientific Intelligence, his son Sam Nivens (Thal), an agent of the aforementioned group, Dr. Mary Sefton, an exobiologist on loan from NASA, and some scrub agent played by Belzer.  The cursory investigation turns up some interesting things, the main thing being that people in Iowa seem especially strong and exhibit violent tendencies.  Well, it turns out some wee, flat, cartilaginous, fish-like, intelligent, parasitic aliens have come to our little corner of the universe, latching onto the backs of humans, giving them complete control over the actions of their hosts.  The trio manages to capture one of the buggers and return with it to Washington for further investigation.  The big question now seems to be exactly what do these visitors want?  Now I'm no rocket scientist, but I'd guess it would be something along the lines of planetary conquest...and sure enough, various plans come to light, one involving an attempt on `assimilating' the big cheese hisself (I'm speaking of the President of these here United States).  As Mary and her team work desperately to better understand the creatures (and uncover exploitable weaknesses), the gooberment deploys the army to contain the sinister invasion, but these efforts are in vain as the aliens seem to be multiplying at an exponential rate, eventually taking over the great metropolis that is Des Moines, Iowa...quoting a line from another film (specifically 1986 feature Aliens), ""I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit""...ultimately events occur, someone within the group is `taken', and a rescue is attempted as agents try to infiltrate the hive.  Is the human race destined to become soulless automaton hosts for mini-stingrays from outer space?  Perhaps, but would that really be so bad?  I mean think about it...how swell it would be to have something else making all your decisions for you, alleviating you of all responsibility?  Freewill is over-rated anyhow...I say acquiesce to your slimy, alien masters and enjoy the ride...

As I've said, I haven't read the original source material for this film, so I can't say what was kept and what was changed, but I did enjoy this movie.  It starts quick out of the gate and maintains a brisk pace throughout, keeping its focus well.  I thought most all the performers did well and I appreciated the chemistry, especially between Thal and Warner's characters.  I will say their burgeoning relationship seemed to come on a bit quick, but given their relative appeal, it wasn't completely unbelievable that they should have the primal desire to shag each other.  I was slightly disappointed that Warner's character devolved a little as the film carried on, appearing less of a character and more of a classic, sci-fi stereotype (the female in distress needing rescuing), but she does gain some strength again near the end.  I really like Sutherland's character, a suave, no nonsense, intelligent, and pragmatic individual willing to sacrifice much in the line of duty.  Thal did well in the role of Sam, a character who seemed to get the beating about once every ten minutes throughout the film (the aliens, in controlling their hosts, also imbued them chemically with strength beyond that of normal).  If he wasn't getting slapped around or kicked in the head, he was being thrown down the stairs...he did manage to get in a few good licks, though, along with showing us the splendor of his nekkid hindquarters, which I really didn't need to see (I'm sure many a female viewer appreciated it), but whatever.  It would have been nice to see a little skin from Ms. Warner if only to offset the visual of a nekkid Eric Thal, but if you want that, you'll have to catch it in one of her other films, a feature titled Doc Hollywood (1991).  My favorite scene occurs near the end, as we see our protagonists racing to catch a helicopter, trying to stay ahead of some alien controlled hosts intent on doing them great, bodily harm...as the helicopter, which landed on a rooftop, begins to move off the roof, one doofus makes a leaping effort to grab onto the landing gear, missing it by a mile...it just seemed funny seeing this valiant effort fail miserably, as if the alien completely underestimated its hosts abilities, and paid the ultimate price.  I thought the parasitic creatures looked pretty cool, although I didn't understand why in various scenes people were asked to take their shirts off so that the unaffected humans could see if there was an alien on their backs (other than a chance to get see people without their shirts on).  Given the size of the creatures, one could have easily determined this with a simple pat down.  The biggest bone to pick for me was the ending, something another reviewer has already brought up...I don't want to give anything away, but essentially we see everyone relaxing under the belief the threat is over, but it really isn't, which results in a climatic aerial sequence.  While exciting, it felt tacked on and unnecessary, adding very little to the overall production other than an over-the-top ending.  Oh well, that's Hollywood for you...other than a few aspects, overall I thought this feature, albeit by the numbers, relatively well written and just a whole lot of fun.

The picture, presented in widescreen (2.35:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs, looks very sharp and clean, and the Dolby Digital Surround Sound audio comes through clearly.  There are no special features included, but there are English subtitles.

But then along came the Puppet Masters and I was pretty happy with this really great movie despite a few cosmetic changes to make the movie doable without a huge budget; while flying cars might have been kind of cool, not having them didn't make a difference to the spirit of the movie or the book. Nor did I miss seeing a lot of people running around near-naked like in the book.

While the movie is not 100 per cent true to the book, it's still a very good adaptation and any fan of the book would enjoy it nonetheless. My only gripe is with the DVD itself: I had seen this movie on Showtime, and not in the restrictive widescreen format that the DVD has. While this may be great for very large screen TVs, the letter-box format doesn't work for me at all and we consummers should be given the choice to buy wide screen or full screen versions.

And, then too, there are no other special features which would have been nice. So those few matters force me to give this DVD only four stars instead of the five it deserves but it's still pretty good.",1147392000,6,1215,4.255411255411255

As others pointed out, the movie starts well, but ..

.. it goes downhill fast. The end scene had me squirming in my seat, had to fastforward, couldn't watch anymore. Just get this damned movie over with.

So my questions are:

1) Did I miss something - the first human to have the alien removed killed himself from withdrawal symptons, (pity none of the hospital staff saw that coming, since I did). Yet later we see our heroes and several million other people having the aliens detatched with no apparent withdrawal.

2) Did Heinlen really write a scene in the book which has two heroes exchanging machine gun fire with aliens in an enclosed space apparently immune to all the bullets that come their way, yet hitting their target every time?

3) Why would the head of a secret government agency be messing around in an area which is obviously not secure yet - couldn't see that scene coming?

If I had a couple of hours to waste, I'm sure I could find many more questions, but sorry this film just isn't worth it.

639294,4,630340720X,"I was apprehensive about watching this movie because of the generally poor professional reviews.  Thus, it has taken me nine years to get around to watching it.  I'm glad I did.  The book is reasonably faithful to the well-written book by Robert A. Heinlein.  There are departures from the book to keep the movie moving along, but the essence of the movie remains faithful to the story.

One of the interesting things about the book and the movie, which some reviewers have pointed to as poor acting, is that Donald Sutherland (as Andrew Nivens) and Eric Thal (as Sam Nivens, Andrew's son) seem to be relatively expressionless.  Heinlein described both characters as being rather stoic, nearly emotionless people in his book.  It's difficult to portray that type of character on the screen because the acting can come across as wooden or emotionless.  Eric Thal acted Heinlein wrote Sam Nivens.  I am not sufficiently familiar with Eric Thal to comment on his acting abilities in general, but I reasonably satisfied by his portrayal of Sam.  His acting could have been better, but it was acceptable.

One point that I found rather distressing is that in Heinlein's original story, everyone was pretty much running around with minimal clothing by the end of the story to prevent the slugs from hiding in pants or loose underwear, as the slugs were fairly small.  The movie minimized this exposure, likely because it might have distracted further from the movie.  However, one of society's first reactions in this situation would be to have everyone nearly nude to prevent slug-ridden people from infiltrating those that were not.

Unfortunately for this movie it came much later than many other movies that may share similar concepts.  However, consider that the original novel was published in 1951, and pre-dates the vast majority of movies such as ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" ""Alien"" and the great host of other alien possession movies.  Thus, all these other movies may be derivative from the book ""The Puppet Masters,"" but not the other way around, particularly considering how faithful the movie was to the book.

There have been few movie-makers brave enough to attempt filming a Heinlein book; unfortunate, because Heinlein is one of the most influential science fiction writers of all time.  The two recent movies based on Heinlein's books are B-movies (this movie and ""Starship Troopers""), but for all their flaws they are a very rare treat for hard-core science fiction fans and for Heinlein fans.

The movie is based on Robert A. Heinlein's SF classic of the same name, which was written at around the same time as Jack Finney's similarly-themed _The Body Snatchers_ (one film adaptation of which, incidentally, also featured Sutherland). The book isn't Heinlein's best work but his worst is at least readable.
Likewise, the movie is mostly watchable. It just doesn't maintain its crackle all the way through. And at this late date, we really need something more impressive than the usual run of 'pod people' to justify making this movie, since Finney's book has already been done _three times_. (And yes, I _do_ want a movie -- and a book -- where somebody asks why the aliens 'hate' us. Was _The Day the Earth Stood Still_ filmed in vain?)

After the opening titles, we are introduced to the main characters, a field of government agents headed by Donald Sutherland (who has mastered the art of subtle earnestness in his career), and populated by Eric Thal (remember him as the young Hasidic scholar who becomes involved with Melanie Griffith in A STRANGER AMONG US?) and Julie Warner (who exudes both passion and intelligence in this role).  After some portentious signs, there are two or three truly exciting action sequences, one right after another.  The problem is, after all of this, I looked at my watch and found that there was still over an hour of movie to go.  That's when the film becomes, as my title says, dull as dishwater.
In the last hour, which seems more like two, this film endlessly repeats itself, in scene after scene.  Plans of attack are presented to us, and then played out of us in the same exact way, so that there is no suspense.  After three or four such consecutive scenes, there begins to be no interest, either.  Then, there are the agonizingly long scenes involving Eric Thal and Julie Warner alone together, played out slowly and without soundtrack as if suddenly turning into Steven Soderburgh's sex, lies and videotape (truly a great film; however, that same style does NOT fit into this ""thriller"" well at all).  What we end up with is a very ungainly, uneven film that alternates between high-charged action/sci-fi scenes and those containing long stretches of dull-as-dishwater dialogue.  By the end, I was very happy--that it was over, as I nearly fell asleep ten times in the last half-hour alone!
Now I know why this film received largely negative reviews when it was initially released in theaters in late-1994.  It's too bad, as it is from the classic novel by Robert A. Heinlein; unread by me, the basic concept is fascinating and reminds me of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (both 1962 and 1978)--except both of these classic sci-fi/horror films are more exciting than this one. Come to think of it, Donald Sutherland was in the latter BODY SNATCHERS film, and did much better in that much better film.  Thank God I spent less than the Amazon price for THE PUPPET MASTERS DVD!

  The cast is good, if not extraordinary.  The big name talent of the film was Donald Sutherland, who did an excellent job of capturing the character found in the book.  I was pleased with Julie Warner's perfomance as Mary, and both pleased and surprised by Eric Thal's perfomance as Sam.  Granted he did have a disturbing habit of exhibiting emotion with his mouth, but he was a pleasant character.
  If you haven't read the book, I highly suggest that you do, it is better.  At the same time, I felt that the changes that were made were good ones.  It modernized the concept to fit with our current culture and technological level, as opposed to Heinlein's hypothetical, and unrealistic future depiction.  The movie flowed fairly well with the exception of the end.

I'll admit that I watched this film not because I was aching to see it but because it had an interesting sounding premise for a sci-fi film - one that seemed very familiar.  I'm not a huge sci-fi buff, but I'll give them their due when warranted.
I do like Donald Sutherland.  He has truly been a venerable screen actor.
In this film, Sutherland plays a government operative charged with discovering the truth about an possible UFO landing in Iowa.  Joining him is his secret service-like son, played very well by Eric Thal.  Rounding out their investigative group is a NASA scientist played by Julie Warner.  Thal and Warner are both very attractive and athletic looking.  Thal has the looks of a fashion model and the body of a tri-athlete.  When he peels off his shirt you can see every sinuey muscle in his chest and abdomen.  This is not a guy that I would want to have to go up against.  And that fact plays out as he and the team are forced to face a formidable foe in the aliens who have landed.
The Puppet Masters is supposedly the source material for the Invasion of the Body Snatchers films.  Written by Robert Heinlien, the book (I've not read it) is supposedly very similar to this movie, but not to the Body Snatcher movies.
The aliens in this film don't envelope the humans as in the early films and then replicate them.  They are parasitic and take over their human host's minds.
This movie has many exciting moments and will have you on the edge of your seat quite often.  I found it refreshingly simplistic in its approach - lacking the early films' attempt to maintain Heinlien's supposed inferences to the McCarthyism of the 1950's.  Instead, I saw a pure sci-fi film that really was believable but for one key point.  Richard Belzer becomes infected with an alien and then has it removed.  He goes through severe withdrawals when the creature is removed and ends up committing suicide.  Subsequent removals of aliens from victims do not result in withdrawals Belzer experienced and certainly do not result in suicides.  In fact, the freed victims seem to have a strong resolve to them.  You might write this off to a stronger resolve than Belzer's character, except that he is a government agent who should have such a strong resolve.
That one point aside, the movie does maintain as much continuity as can be shown and maintains its ""believability.""

However even though ""The Puppet Masters"" is arguably one of the best sci-fi *stories* ever written, the movie (as usual), does it no justice at all.  All the essential social elements have been removed and as is so often the case in science fiction movies the scene has been moved to the present day presumeably to make the audience identify with the characters more and also to save money on special effects.
All the nudity and sex of the original novel has been removed in favour of a new (token) black character, a large rubber ""nest creature"" and a *lot* of shooting and marine-type lingo like ""lock and load"" etc...  I guess this makes it more of an ""action"" movie?
Despite what the other reviewer says, Sutherland does not overact and is his usual great self, the big flaw in terms of casting is the CREEPY Eric Thal as the lead guy (how can you identify with that?), and the repulsive Julie Warner doing a bad Barbara Streisand impersonation as his sexy??? girlfriend.  (I mean when the damsel is in distress you should want the guy to save her whereas I found myself cheering for her execution.)  The fact that this movie is eight years old now and neither of these two actors have done anything of note since, says it all.
All that being said, for some reason I find myself pulling this movie off the shelf much more often that it deserves.  It's a stinker, but somehow comforting to watch over and over again.

The movie plays around with themes of dehumanization and invasion from without and within. Partial and full nudity is used intelligently to suggest emotional nakedness and vulnerability.
