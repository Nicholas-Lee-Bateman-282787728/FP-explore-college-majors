1921260,4,B0000D1FG4,"Once more Anthony Mann revealing before us as a director with multiple concerns ; he was a real prism . In this film he focuses his attention on the French Revolution.

Both forces are after possesion of a secret diary containing valuable information. This will be the sparkly starting point to put on screen a lively and more exciting costume adventures .

1921261,1,B0000D1FG4,"Reign of Terror, or The Black Book, is one of the great Anthony Mann's very best pictures - a nightmarish tale of the French Revolution shot in the style of a film noir expressionistic nightmare with superlative production design from William Cameron Menzies. But I'm loathe to say any more that might encourage you to buy this disc simply because this is without doubt the very worst DVD I have ever seen - the poor contrast and appalling definition ruining John Alton's brilliant cinematography, while the variable transfer speed makes slurs of many of the witticisms. This is a neglected masterpiece crying out for the kind of treatment that MPI have given the Sherlock Holmes films, but whatever you do, don't make the mistake of thinking this terrible transfer from Alpha/Gotham is worth the low price - it isn't, and that's a real crime against cinema.",1077148800,48,858,4.883561643835616
1921262,2,B0000D1FG4,"This movie is a gem, but to view it in these poor conditions (the frame is off-center, the blacks are light grey and the pictures fuzzy) is really an offense to the original material.

1921274,5,B0000D1FG4,"Why this cinema gem, ""The Black Book"" (aka Reign of Terror 1949) has been hidden so long from general circulation is disturbing. I can only reason that its director, Anthony Mann, is on someone's black list, or they're afraid it would dislodge ""Citizen Kane"" from its ranking. Never mind these postulations, buy this title and be amazed what others have said, this is a historical adventure film of the highest order shot in unmatched blacks, whites and silvers. This is high drama recorded as fine art in each frame. The plot contains unsurpassed intrigue and betrayals to restore freedom to France in her darkest moment. The cast is superb: Robert Cummings, Arlene Dahl, Richard Basehart (Robespierre) and the most duplicitous, cunning fiend in this film, Arnold Moss(evil Foucher)with Norman Lloyd, Charles McGraw (well-disguised) and Beulah Bondi in supporting parts. This is an incredible, suspenseful adventure story with a touch of romance that burns dimly at first, later to thrive. This is absolutely thrilling high art.

1921276,2,B0000D1FG4,"This film arrived new and played fine.  My issue is the poor quality of the transfer.
The image quality is fair at best, not clear or crisp.  It is a weak transfer of a master that was not digitally cleaned up.  It is in Standard Definition, 480p 1:33.  I don't care how the transfer was labeled.  If the producers of this content, a fine and interesting movie, had really cared about it, they would have cleaned it up and given it the good SD transfer it deserves.

As the star of ""The Black Book"" he plays a daring agent seeking to ""save France"" from its own revolution.

It is suspenseful and easy to follow, but I would recommend that viewers have some knowledge of the French Revolution before watching it.

1921296,3,B0000D1FG4,"The story is still good after all these years, although Bob Cummings as the hero is a little presumptuous of his talent.

Other movies to buy and round this one out are ""Marie Antoinette"" with Norma Scherer, ""The Scarlett Pimpernal"" with Leslie Howard, and ""A Tale of Two Cities"" (1935) with Ronald Coleman.  If you are interested in fictional prequels..re: Louis XIII and Louis XIV....the ""Three Musketeers"" (1948)with Gene Kelly and ""Man in the Iron Mask"" (1939) with Louis Hayward.

1921300,5,B0000D1FG4,"This completely unorthodox, unusual film, demonstrates that in the hands of brilliant talent even seemingly screwy ideas can be realized into marvelous entertainment and even art.  Anthony Mann and his cinematographer, John Alton, took all the trappings of film noir and made a period piece about the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution and, on an obviously very slim budget, created a fast paced, exciting, thriller.  It rips along with incredible tension and atmosphere created by a fine cast and the skill of the two aforementioned gentlemen.  The limits in scope due to budget contraints, is more than made up for by the film noir elements: all light and shadow, camera angles and focus.  And it works marvelously, the deep blacks and slanted light fitting perfectly for the mood of terror for the eponymous era.

The cast is uniformly excellent, with Richard Basehart a nicely fanatical Robespiere, Arlene Dahl stunningly gorgeous, a stalwart Bob Cummings, and most especially Arnold Moss, as a slyly duplicitous Foucher. Other fine performers are here in small rolls: Norman Lloyd, Buleah Bondi, Charles McGraw etc. There is enough actual history to ground the fictional melodrama in reality, and the violence and fear of the era is certainly captured.

This fine, strange film has finally gotten an acceptable transfer in this Sony addition.  The prior DVD release of this title, as many have pointed out, was atrocious.  This version is a vast improvement. Slightly grainy at times on BluRay player/big screen but perfectly viewable.  And unless they create a BluRay version, this is likely the best we're going to get.  I would give it 4 stars for the limitations of the film, but I give it 5 here because Mann and Alton did so much with so little, and it is like no other film you're likely to see.",1343347200,17,1817,4.947368421052632
1921301,2,B0000D1FG4,this is an interesting film by quality film makers -- but the quality of the print on the DVD STINKS! Not sure where one can find a good clean print of this public domain film... However the vendor that shipped the DVD was excellent.,1335657600,,233,4.318181818181818
1921302,1,B0000D1FG4,I saw this film on AMC and thourghly enjoyed it. I was shocked when I saw this DVD. Who was the inept clown who edited out many of the most important sequences and made the DVD version so patchy as to be almost unwatchable? The film was not that long and did not need to be edited. If you only watched this DVD you would be hard pressed to discern a cohesive story line. I will not purchase anything more from this distributor as they should be ashamed of themselves.,1322352000,,467,4.2
1921303,1,B0000D1FG4,"Can't I give it a zero-stars rating? Shucks! Well, Alpha Video transfers tend to be inferior, but this surpasses their usual race to the bottom. about 20% of the picture is missing on the left side, which is odd considering that fitting it to the TV format meant only trimming it from 1.37 to 1.33. So what they've done is taken some off either the top or bottom as well as the left side. Titles and credits are offset to one side, and not by just a smidgen. The video quality is totally sub-par; obviously, they haven't made the least effort at restoring the film. Finally, the audio is barely comprehensible in some parts, and poor in the least-worst parts. I didn't even bother finishing the movie. It's going directly in the trash.
Based on my previous experiences, my recommendation to everyone is to avoid an Alpha Video transfer. Unfortunately I did not notice they were the publisher. Equally unfortunately, theirs is the only copy that's been published.",1320796800,,962,4.732142857142857

1921305,4,B0000D1FG4,"The Black Book, 1949 film

The story begins on July 26, 1794 in Revolutionary France when Maximilien Robespierre was in power, but had his enemies. The Marquis de la Fayette sent an envoy to France. Danton is condemned to death by Robespierre. Did he outlive his usefulness? Can Robespierre become dictator? Du Valle from Strasbourg arrives at an inn. Will he be disturbed? A woman brings a message from Barras. Next Fouchet, the head of the Secret Police, visits him. Robespierre wants his missing black book, a list of enemies who will meet the guillotine. Du Valle must find it in 24 hours, or else. Charles meets Madeline again. The ""Black Book"" can be used against Robespierre. There is a surprising upset to their plans. Will those who could have the ""Black Book"" be silenced? ""Dead enemies make good friends.""

Du Valle visits Barras in prison. The murders were to spread fear and distrust among Barras' party. What will happen when Du Valle's wife arrives in Paris? Will there be a surprise? There is a chase for action. Charles makes a deal with Fouchet, and they search a room for the Black Book in a room full of books. There is fighting, Charles escapes again. But the soldiers search near where he is hidden. They escape from Paris after showing their papers. Soldiers follow to the farm, but they stay hidden. When questioning a young boy St. Just shows his character. There is drama in simply taking a nap! Can they recover the Black Book (which lists Robespierre's enemies) and get away to Paris? Fouchet has a plan to get the Black Book.

The Convention meets with cheering for Robespierre, the Friend of the People. That Black Book is passed around to the representatives, who scan its contents. Whose names are recorded there? This has a revolutionary effect on the representatives, they now oppose Robespierre. Can his rhetoric turn the situation around? No, a shot muffles his voice. Now it is Robespierre's turn to meet the guillotine. Fouchet talks to a soldier. ""I'll try to remember your name.""

This is a very good dramatic story that is based on the events of July 1794 when the reign of Robespierre came to an end. It was followed by a committee or directorate that ruled France. France continued to be threatened by its enemies, the aristocracy that wanted to keep its powers and privileges to exploit people. In time, France was conquered and a king put back on the throne. But the slogans of ""liberty, equality, fraternity"" won the hearts and minds of the people. A good history book will give you the facts behind this movie. [I wonder if this story reflected the concerns of 1949 America? Were there those who spoke against past politicians to gain power and privileges for their selfish interests.]

1921306,1,B0000D1FG4,"Essentially a fake DVD, apparently ripped from a VHS recording from a television broadcast and missing about twenty percent of its running time.

1921307,2,B0000D1FG4,"I didn't realize that there was a better, but still bad transfer of this, that also has more of the film.  This version is very blurry.  You can tell that it is a gorgeous film, so Mann fans should see even a poor version.  The secondary actors are well cast.  Arlene Dahl is beautiful, if not much else.  Robert Cummings isn't all that good, but he doesn't overact dreadfully, as I've seen him do in other movies, so I sort of liked him in this.  While not all that accurate, the film does deal with some of the factual happenings of the revolution and has a great air of menace.",1233792000,,580,4.2272727272727275

It requires muchvideo adjustment to get it to a comfortable image. It is a shame for it has many first class features:(1) A script, reasonably faithful to actual history, but obviously cut to come out as a basic thriller,(2) a splendid cast, with the exception of Cummings, who however does not spoil the drama,(3)Arlene Dahl, one of the great beauties, who did not havetoo much luck with her assignments.

1921309,1,B0000D1FG4,"This is a comment on the Synergy Entertainment release of Anthony Mann's ""The Black Book"" (AKA ""Reign of Terror""). This splendid film just can't get any respect on DVD! The running time of this version is 75 minutes, making it 14 minutes shorter than the version on Alpha Video!  Critical scenes are missing, with Synergy imposing its own fade outs on entire sections.  Even the previous reviewer who called this version ""passable,"" noted the gaps in continuity.  Visually, the print is much softer than Alpha's, with many jumps and splices, with much more of the picture area cropped off, and it goes in and out of focus.  I previously thought that the Alpha release was the worst transfer of a movie I had ever seen, but this travesty put out by Synergy is a total disgrace, and should be avoided at all costs!",1219017600,27,812,4.6573426573426575
1921310,4,B0000D1FG4,"After reading disgruntled reviews of two other DVDs of this classic film, I decided to take a chance on one that had not been reviewed.  While the intensity of the excellent acting holds interest, and the atmosphere, start to finish, is suitably jarring, suggestive of that particularly horrific period in French history, black-out breaks in the action (original to the film, or the result of splicing and editing--hard to tell which)detract from the presentation a bit.  In the climatic conclusion, when the arch villain gets his comeuppance, we see him addressing the angry mob, hoping to bluff his way out of the situation.  In the complete version, Robespierre is shown getting shot in the throat, but in this cut, in an instant, he goes from speech to speechless, a bandage wrapped about his neck sans visual explanation.  If I had not seen the full scene on a TV broadcast, I would not have known what happened.  Still, the image is easy on the eyes.  Facial expressions and other details are clear and readable.  Overall, a good effort to preserve all of the elements of the original film.

When my library purchased this restored version, they displaced it so it would be noticed. I didn't know what to expect. I had just watched ""Black Book"", which is an excellent movie about the underground Netherlands resistance movement during WWII. Interesting that similarly named movies would be about parallel universes. I was not disappointed and enjoyed every minute of it.
