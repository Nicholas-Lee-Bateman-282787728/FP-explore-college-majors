8562983,5,B00B5OW0RG,I found this fascinating. I didn't realize how much politics was involved in building the empire and what a quick study Temujin was.  He was more than a military genius.  I first found the series on Netflix but here you have more discs and superior quality which makes reading the English subtitles easier. And it was a meritocracy. I've only gone thru it once but its a keeper. :),1373241600,2,381,4.507246376811594
