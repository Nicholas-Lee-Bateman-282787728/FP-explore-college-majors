6649247,5,B00NGAJJGC,This drama was another one of the best to come out of the 90's. It's witty and entertaining. I never get tired of watching it.,1527984000,,126,4.08
6649248,3,B00NGAJJGC,"Was a gift for my mother in law. She really enjoyed the packaging. However, the DVD's were mediocre in quality. Some work fine. Others would freeze, skip an episode of not play at all. Yes, we cleaned the player and tried it on 3 other plans same issues. If only I knew sooner I would have returned them. Disappointing!",1526601600,,319,4.423728813559322
6649249,4,B00NGAJJGC,"I'd been wanting to watch this show since I read the Lee Goldberg books, and since this contains the entire series, I figured I'd splurge on it. I adore this show, but I'm a little disappointed to find out that there is absolutely NO option to add subtitles. This is essential, since where I live I often have to watch tv with the volume low, and the sound quality is enough to make the characters difficult to understand as it is. I can still watch the discs on my laptop and use my ear buds, but I'd much rather relax on the couch and watch it on a 40"" screen. Other than this, I would highly recommend this product for any murder mystery fans.",1526342400,2,646,4.217741935483871

6649253,5,B00NGAJJGC,"Would love to give this a 10, but 5 is my 10 on Amazon!  This is a fantastic TV series (filmed '93 through '02).  Loved the characters in this series.  That Dick and Barry Van Dyke are such good lookers and you will love their deep masculine voices.  If I could rob the ""rocking chair"" and place Dick next to me in mine and then rob ""the cradle"", it would be Barry--love their masculinity.  Loved it when Dick Van Dyke would ""cut the rug"" and sing and dance at times in the episodes.  Thought that was great!  You will love the Amanda, Jesse, Jack and Norman characters.  Seems like Jack and Norman disappeared early in the series and were missed, but the series remained strong despite them leaving.  I missed them and wish they could have weaved back in and out as they could for the viewers sake.  You will enjoy watching them solve crimes and the zest for life they all have.  A SERIES WORTH ADDING TO YOUR FILM LIBRARY!",1523750400,2,924,4.345029239766082

6649264,5,B00NGAJJGC,I own all 8 seasons. I absolutely love this show but please where are the subtitles?  Most elderly love Dick Van Dyke but we need subtitles.  I watch it up close  in my kitchen but would be happy to buy a whole new set with subtitles so I can watch it in my bedroom.  Dick Van Dyke has such warmth and charm.  It just makes you feel good to watch him.,1519948800,,351,3.887323943661972
6649265,4,B00NGAJJGC,Bought as a gift for my adult daughter. She loves the independence of watching at her leisure and absence of commercials. We are happy with the purchase.,1519171200,,153,4.703703703703703
6649266,5,B00NGAJJGC,What a great value. Enjoyed every single one of them.,1519084800,,53,4.4
6649267,5,B00NGAJJGC,"My young adult and teen children enjoy watching this with me and my husband, who grew up watching it.  Van Dyke's vaudeville skills are often displayed and we all enjoy that, especially since we loved him as Bert in Mary Poppins. There are a few misses, as to be expected, but most episodes are enjoyable and we all find it a great relief in comparison to the dysfunction of what is mostly on tv today.  We love watching ""Chachi"" early on and enjoy the rest of the cast very much as well.",1518825600,,488,4.293478260869565
6649268,1,B00NGAJJGC,"There are no subtitles, not even any closed captions.  Diagnosis Murder is absolutely worthless to me without one of those.  I thought they were required by law to at least have CC, so I tried to send it back for a refund.  But they never replied to my request.  Disappointed!",1518825600,,276,4.46
6649269,5,B00NGAJJGC,I was very happy with this purchase.  The picture quality was very good and only had a few issues with sticking.  I liked the fact that VEI is willing to deal with the DVD issues if there were any.  I like that they are willing to take responsibility for their product.  It had unique packaging which I personally liked.  I was working nights when this series first came out and only saw a few of them.  The stories have  generally held up over the years and it does not seem dated.  Dick Van Dyke is wonderful!,1518739200,2,511,4.25
6649270,4,B00NGAJJGC,I was disappointed that there were no closed captions.,1517961600,,54,5.111111111111111
6649271,5,B00NGAJJGC,"We've viewed the First Season, and it is all that we were looking for.  It's been a prime time series, been in syndication, and now we can watch it at our leisure.  Not tied to cable or satellite providers.  And you can watch the episodes as often as you like.  How much better can it get.  Oh, by the way, Doc is driving a CLASSIC Jaguar roadster.  Not exactly my first love, automobile speaking, but close (MG-TC was the first) I am envious of Dick Van Dyke for getting to drive this GEM.  I hope it doesn't suffer the same fate as other series, where classics are deigned to be destroyed.
Like a good, mostly FAMILY rated (by me) mysteries, this is it.  Like Extreme Violence, Extreme Language, Sensual Situations, look somewhere else.  The Family friendly situations and the logical conclusions is what took us to ordering this series.",1517875200,4,839,4.577181208053691
6649272,4,B00NGAJJGC,"Very good collection of all DM episodes (plus five of the movies).  Four stars because the case is just a cheap plastic box and the DVDs are in a very flimsy paper/plastic sleeve holder.  Also, no subtitles/closed captioning.",1516838400,3,225,4.894736842105263
6649273,2,B00NGAJJGC,"We have been enjoying watching this set for a year now working our way from the very start. Unfortunately at Season 5 discs 4, the last four episodes are out of sinc. The sound is about 2 secs behind the picture! We struggled through 'Promises  to keep' but the rest of the disc continued too out of sinc. It has taken a year for us to get this far into the set. If only there were subtitles, then perhaps we could have turned down the sound, but it was too annoying. Before buying this set, I had read reviews about sinchronization issues, but I hoped for the best thinking this may be only some customers. My belief now is that it is probably this disc on the complete production run. I even considered buying season 5 alone and swapping the discs, and I can see on the Season 5 reviews that this did solve the sinc problems for another customer, but the season 5 set has seven dics and in my comlete set, season 5 is only four discs so a direct swap wouldn't fit into my set. Anyway 'buyer beware'.",1516406400,,1001,4.2408376963350785
6649274,5,B00NGAJJGC,"I purchased this as a gift for my mother, so I can't review the show itself. The Blu-ray set seems a good deal for the money and my mother is happy with it, and that is good enough for me. One good thing about this set is that each season is in a separate case which all fit into a slipcase package - much better than those ungainly big cases that hold an entire series in one case.",1515628800,,382,3.91025641025641

Mark and Steve get help from Amanda Bentley and Jack Stewart in the first two seasons and then from season three on Jack Stewart is replaced with Jesse Travis.  They work together to solve crimes that happen in the city of Los Angeles.

6649279,3,B00NGAJJGC,"I bought the series earlier in the year and just finished watching it.  I am disappointed with the quality of at least two of the DVD's. I tried watching the first of the movie DVD's last night and spent a half hour trying to get it to play.  It alternated between skipping and freezing so much that I couldn't watch any of the three episodes that were on it. When I tried going to the next episode, it just kept returning to the main menu. I thought something was wrong with the player but another DVD works so that wasn't the reason. I also had one other DVD that had the voice/action way off sync so I couldn't watch it.  I don't know how to go about getting replacements for those 2 flawed DVD's. I enjoyed the series other than that. I expected better quality from Amazon.",1504310400,5,777,4.272108843537415

To me it brings back the time when you could just turn on your TV and watch good clean TV and did not have to pay $100.00 a month.  So maybe the picture is not HD, get over it and just enjoy the plots, something not many programs have today.  This is just my opinion.",1487721600,20,377,3.857142857142857

8677955,3,B00NGAJJGC,I'm still working my way through the set but am finding flaws in some of the episodes.  Some were just short periods but one made the episode un watchable.  Picture freezes then slow motions then normal again then repeats.  I don't know what action to take re problem or who to address it to.,1528588800,,292,4.37037037037037
