203212,4,193323301X,"May 31st 2014 is the 125th  Anniversary Of The Terrible Catastrophe we call, ""The Johnstown Flood"". This Documentary 'Short' film won the Academy Award in 1991. But a longer expanded version was subsequently created by Charles Guggenheim The one hour long expanded version is the one to buy, this is the short half hour long original version that is sold for just $ 26.95 by the Johnstown Flood Museum's online store.  Avoid the DVD narrated by the actor Richard Dryfuss it has been sanitized to hide the culpability of the Southfork Fishing & Hunting Club that was resposnible for the Disaster in May of 1889.

The American Experience aired the new extended version on PBS back in the 90's.  It has disappeared except for a copy available FREE on You Tube, you should get that and make a copy as it is not sold anywhere, and is by far the best documentary available on the subject.  David McCullough, the Pulitzer Prize winning author also wrote his very first book, The Johnstown Flood, and he narrated the introduction to the film, and its conclusion.  His book is the best and most complete account of this important part of American history.
I edit this in April 2014.  I add that the excellent extended version of this 1/2 hour video, the one hour version may be purchased at the web site for Charles Guggenheim, though it was not possible before.  I also located the entire 1 hour extended version on You Tube, though the quality may be less than desired.  This is the version to own especially as we are only about a month away from the 125th Anniversary of this greatest of one day disasters in the United States before the massacres of September 11th, 2001 during the hugely incompetent Bush-Cheney administration.",1314144000,3,1724,4.72
203213,5,193323301X,"Our family saw this film while visiting the Johnstown Flood Museum.  It mixes rare footage with recreated scenes to vividly tell the story of what happened in May of 1889.  Although short in length, this is an exceptionally well crafted documentary film that places you in the midst of a tragic event in U.S. history.  It kept the attention of even our youngest children for the full 30 minutes and we all came away with a better understanding of the unfortunate events that contributed to the flood.",1271116800,11,500,4.724137931034483

7801721,4,193323301X,"This DVD is called ""The Johnstown Flood"", but is really a short cut version of Len Cario's original full length Academy Award Winning movie, ""The Johnstown Flood"".  Same name, different messages.  The award winning movie was concerned with who was involved, who wasn't, and how it all could've been avoided in the first place.  The Johnstown Flood was Not a natural disaster but a man made catastrophe about to happen, and did.  The book is a lot better.  We are giving this version a generous 4-stars, only because of it's historical significance.",1412035200,,548,4.913043478260869
7801722,4,193323301X,"The late Charles Guggenheim created  this film and won the Academy Award for Documentary Short in 1991 2 years after the Centennial he made the film to commemorate.  The Charles Guggenheim web site did have the one hour expanded version he created available as well.  That was created when a lady who had seen this called Charles Guggenheim and offered him the photo's taken by a relative of hers that was present at the South Fork Fishing & Hunting Club, before the disaster.  Those turned out to be the only existing photograph's of that infamous club and its activities.  No other documentary has them, only the 1 hour expanded version of this film.  Incidentally, do not waste your money on the newer film narrated by actor Richard Dryfus, it is a sanitized invention devoid of any mention of the people and the club they owned that was responsible for killing 2209 people, wiping out the city of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and all the subsequent human misery their abject neglect and ignoring of warning caused.
The richest Americans of the time owned that club, and their lawyers managed to keep them from paying a single penny in compensation to their victims, adding to the burden of the families they destroyed. The Dryfus Film leave  all mention of them out of that film, rendering it worthless to all who seek to learn about this great disaster in America. Tomorrow is the 125th Anniversary of that death & destruction.  May God have mercy on those who were made victims that terrible day.",1401408000,9,1498,4.77906976744186
7801723,5,193323301X,"The Johnstown Flood, films to date it still one of the most Shocking stories, I find this DVD is similar to the one out by Richard Dreyfuss Documentary , being that said I would like to see this stories on the BIG SCREEN other than 30 minute film, may be Amazon could get the Johnstown Flood word out to Big Film Directors thanks for looking",1391644800,,341,4.2615384615384615
7801724,1,193323301X,The video  was overpriced for the 30 minutes it took to watch it...I was hoping for a Ken Burns documentary! Sadly disappointing...it was just to artsy for my taste. Take your time and read David McCullogh's book.,1384905600,3,213,4.756756756756757
7801725,5,193323301X,"Having recently visited the area, we were reminded of this tragic event and wanted to learn more details.  This film is being shown in the museum in Johnstown but our time constraints did not allow us to visit the museum or view the film.  We were able to purchase this documentary from Amazon and learned about the events leading up to this tragedy.  Very well done!",1350345600,,367,4.53030303030303
