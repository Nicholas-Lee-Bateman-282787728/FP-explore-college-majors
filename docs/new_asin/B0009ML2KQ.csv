2300542,5,B0009ML2KQ,"Undoubtedly, John Wayne's finest acting performance.  Set on-board a DC-4 flying enroute from Honolulu to San Francisco, this ""air disaster"" film has everything: passenger gunfights, failed engines,  fuel leaks, to squabbles in the cockpit bewteen the pilots.  Couple this  with a fantastic musical score, and you have a film whose plot has been  copied, unsucessfully, for the last 30 years.",952905600,,392,5.466666666666667

2300551,5,B0009ML2KQ,"This is one of the best, probably one of the earliest of the disaster movie genre.  Its an in-depth character study of the passengers and doesnt fail to hold the viewers attention.  Despite starring some of the biggest names in the industry during the mid-50s, nobody gets a long period of time before the cameras.  The outcome is in question right up until the end.  Recommend for young teens and older.  I was about 12 when this movie came out, and it kept me interested from beginning to end.",1507420800,,495,4.51685393258427

2300578,5,B0009ML2KQ,"As a 9yo child our family was on a supposed to be no stop flight from Chicago to LA California. Approaching the Rockie Mountain range our DC 6 lost thrust in an engine. Captain feathered the bad engine and made unscheduled landing n Las Vegas airport. AS fate would have it I had just watched on TV the powerful classic inspiring movie High & the Mighty. I knew than as a child 9yo I wanted to be a pilot. Turning 19yo I took ground school and Cessna 150 student flying  lesson at Chicago Midway Airport (MDW). I passed the  FAA flight test a couple years later after starting and stopping and restarting flying lessons. FAA private pilot rated ASEL. The movie is one of MY all time LIFE best movies. The scene in the movie where flight 420 shoots a ""straight in approach"" with the runway lights turned ON high bright -- the movie sound track audio playing in the back
round -- John Wayne calls out """" NOW I LAY ME DOWN  TO SLEEP -- (prayer) "" with  the white moving ""rabbit"" light pointing to the threshold  to the runway ALWAYS draws a TEAR in my eye and gulp in my throat. Soon after my success at age 22yo earning my FAA "" ticket"" I did get to shoot a FULL ILS approach to Midway Airport runway 13L (left) -- I radioed  MDW tower to turn the ""rabbit"" ON HIGH -- tower respond """" Cessna 22 Tango -- """" the rabbit is lite -- cleared to land.

2300581,4,B0009ML2KQ,The movie is corny in some ways - some of the passengers are not very believable - but the flight crew including John Wayne does a good job of making the situation seem real.

2300586,5,B0009ML2KQ,"An almost forgotten but truly good classic film.  It has a deep cast of known actors and they all play their roles magnificently.  John Wayne is excellent as one of the flight crew pilots and so is Robert Stack.  The film is an old fashion cloak & dagger drama of a flight from Hawaii to Calif. that suddenly becomes in distress.  The film runs through the personal lives of many of the passengers and really does a credible job of making each of those characters personable to the viewer of the film.  It's also a story of how strangers working together can overcome a shared adversity.  It's a rather long film but it is gripping and will hold your attention.  You almost never see this film on television and many don't he know it exists, but it is a must-watch film and one you should purchase because you never know when it may vanish from availability.",1475712000,,858,4.461538461538462
2300587,4,B0009ML2KQ,"Put a disparate group of 17 people in a small plane and head for San Francisco.  Give several a drama filled past shown in flashbacks then vibrate the plane into a crisis, past the point of no return, losing fuel, engines on the fritz, an automaton pilot (Robert Stack) having a breakdown, and theres a nut in the back with a gun!!!  Fly the friendly skies you bet.  John Wayne has to bitch-slap Stack to keep him from ditching the plane in the ocean.  We learn a bit too much about some of the passengers and not nearly enough about the ones who at least act normal.  This is almost a disaster flick but it could have used more disaster and less chatter.  Still, this albatross does get off the ground.  It may not be a smooth ride but it is an interesting one.",1474848000,,762,4.25

2300623,4,B0009ML2KQ,"This is a classic old John Wayne drama from 1955. Yes, it's dated by the actors, acting, events, etc....but it's still an entertaining movie to watch. The musical score withstands the test of time and is still a pleasure to listen to. John Wayne projects the typical old school hero type that is rarely portrayed in this way much anymore. He takes over when needed to save the day and get everybody safely on the ground with a safe landing in the end. I really enjoyed the smaller things revealed in the movie...things that were acceptable in the mid fifties, but would no longer be allowed. Like what? Carrying hand gun onto the plane in your pocket, having your fifth of booze on board with you, everyone smoking on the plane, an unlocked door to the pilot and crew, a 4-man cockpit crew including a navigator, a cot for the crew to take turns resting in on long flights, and comfortable looking passenger sets...it's an eye into the past in many ways. Some of the ""shine"" is taken off the movie from the readily recognizable scenes that were borrowed from ""The High and The Mighty"" in the making of the comedy movie ""Airplane"" nearly 25 years later. Still it's a fun movie to watch when nothing else is on and you want some enjoyable alternative entertainment to today's movie selections.",1456531200,4,1291,4.6173913043478265

However, I remember it as a most compelling film with that haunting soundtrack that I can never forget.  I don't consider myself a John Wayne fan, but this film is an exception, revealing a depth and a side of him that I don't often encounter in his work.  The interactions between him and the younger pilot played by Robert Stack are engrossing.  In fact, I was impressed by the entire cast and the development of each character aboard the seemingly doomed flight.  The fact that there are four aviators in my immediate and extended family has also served to heighten my appreciation of this film.",1449532800,,715,4.5546875

2300660,5,B0009ML2KQ,"Great old John Wayne movie, but it is also a groundbreaking movie of its type. It was the first of many airline disaster movies and is still one of the best. One of the things that makes it more dramatic is it is a propellor driven plane rather than a jet so when the engines fail, you can see the prop slowing down and almost stopping. You don't see anything with a jet. While not intended as such, it is a documentary of life as it was seen in the 50's with the attitudes of the day particularly the male/female relationships. Very entertaining and the introductory comments by Leonard Maltin are worth listening to as well.",1444003200,,626,4.405172413793103

2300681,5,B0009ML2KQ,"Although many will accuse this movie of being campy, and even stupid, the truth, as I see it, is that within the context of a much more primitive technology that existed during its time (1954), namely a time when aircraft traveled at much lower speeds and so forth, and airline pilots were largely leftovers from World War II conflicts in the air, the movie is not campy or stupid. Get this movie, especially if you are a John Wayne fan. Also, the technical quality is fairly good. If for nothing else, get this movie because of its breathtakingly beautiful theme music. It has never left my memory since I was 5 years old, when I first saw the movie with my mother on its theatrical debut. It has replayed in my head many times since then, and it wasn't until recently, as an adult, that I rediscovered the name of the movie it came from, so that I could purchase the movie to get the music.",1438646400,,892,4.379518072289157

2300699,4,B0009ML2KQ,"John Wayne sends waves of crowd appeal yet again playing the character of, well, John Wayne.

I had never heard of this film before this viewing.  Though Wayne played in lots of westerns and war films, this is neither (OK, so he played in all kinds of films...I know, I know).  But I have to admit that I was interested to see how many times the iconic ""John Wayne walk"" could appear in a movie set for the most part aboard an airplane.

Spoiler...I counted three conspicuous times the John Wayne walk appeared...the opening scene, and you'll have to watch to find the other two.

I was surprise by the number of prominent character actors that appeared in this film, it was like sitting down and watching a film featuring Wayne and a cast of familiar characters.  You'll see.

The character development was at times loaded with overacting, but was nevertheless quite good.  The small cast contained in a limited space was somewhat reminiscent of the old B/W movie ""Lifeboat"" though not quite as dramatic.

I have to admit that I was surprised to see that the running time for this film was nearly 2.5 hours.  It was an enjoyable time though, and I'm glad I watched it, adding this memory to my selection of John Wayne experiences.

2300724,4,B0009ML2KQ,"The High and the Mighty, 1954 film

This is a story about a flight from Hawaii to California on a C-54 four engine propeller driven airliner. It tells about the crew and passengers stories and lives. [This echoes Chaucers Canterbury Tales from medieval times.] It serves as a witness to the culture and attitudes of that era. Note the little boy who wears a toy pistol on the trip, the smoking in the cabin. [Do they still use the term dumb bunny?] People could carry a pistol on board, the Right to Keep and Bear Arms was respected in those days. What if one passenger starts to make trouble? The others solved this problem.

Some notice an unevenness in the engines. One engine has a fire! This is extinguished but the speed and altitude are decreased. A local ship gets their radio message and relays it to San Francisco. A rescue team is alerted so it can fly towards them. This airliner passed the point of no return; they can only go forward. The Coast Guard lives up to its motto (Semper Paratus). The loss of fuel means they will have to ditch in the sea. The passengers are told what to do. Baggage will be discarded to lighten the load. If the wind changes they may reach the coast. The crisis affects people, we hear them speak their minds.

The navigator recalculates their position, his original calculation was wrong, they cant make land. Eleven more minutes of fuel would allow them to land. Is there a way to compensate? Life vests are passed out to everyone on board, they will be inflated when they go into the water. The co-pilot has a plan - shut down another engine to save fuel. They approach the coast, they are warned of their lowered altitude. The airport lights are turned on. Another engine acts up, its blades are feathered. Full power for the remaining two engines. Wheels and flaps are lowered, and they land safely! The passengers and crew leave the airliner. One is arrested by the police, we see the family of another [for comic relief].

This is an entertaining movie that does not have a lot of action for its dramatic story. The use of ships for long distance travel declined in the 1950s and flying grew in popularity [after the sinking of the Andrea Doria in 1957]. Was this movie designed to promote air travel? A song associated with this movie was very popular.",1427846400,,2302,4.539759036144578

As to the airplane shuddering, DC-6 and 7s did shudder when going near stall speed.  and in those days dumping passenger stuff overboard probably was a good thing to do.

2300840,5,B0009ML2KQ,I remember seeing this film in the theater when I was a young man. It has been kept in the vaults for years and finally it has been released to the public after all these years. I remember whistling the tune for weeks after seeing the movie. Another classic movie that only John Wayne could make. If you love John then you have to add this film to your library.,1414972800,,361,4.171428571428572
2300841,2,B0009ML2KQ,"Okay, let's get the John Wayne element over with first.  John Wayne is John Wayne, period.  If you like John Wayne, you'll like/love him in this movie.

As for the rest of it, well, I remember seeing it as a kid when it first came out.  And naturally I was impressed.  The plane, the music (I'm still impressed by that), all those adults talking about their very adult problems.

But when I finally saw it again last night, I couldn't believe how cardboard those characters all were.  Pure soap opera with lots of overacting.  The script stank (even Spencer Tracy said so when he turned down the John Wayne part).  And the passengers, when they weren't engaging in histrionics about their private lives, were like zombies.  Never said, where the heck's dinner?  Never even got up to go to the bathroom.  And the sole stewardess--everyone's gal pal Doe Avedon--just strolls back and forth in the aisle, chatting here and there (where the heck's the drink cart?) as though stewarding were a breeze (unless there's a crash threat, of course).  She could have knit an extra-large sweater during the flight, for all she had to do.  (Except, again, for the crash threat.)

Jan Sterling was the campiest of all.  Looked like a drag queen and acted like one.  And here's the kicker: her whole angst was about the fact that the guy she'd been corresponding with and who wanted to marry her, hadn't yet seen her in real life.  He'd only seen an old (very old) photo of her, and was basing his amour on that.  And here she was now, looking like she'd had more knocks in life than a bad engine.

Okay, so they finally all land in Frisco, and there's the guy waiting for her.  He takes one look at her, then puts his arm around her and they walk off together.  Well, that's not enough!--not after the hysteria Sterling put us through.  We want a solid scene between them.  We want mush!

But I guess that would have taken screen time away (this is already a lonnnngggg movie) from John Wayne's finale of whistling off into the non-sunset.

BTW, Sterling's boyfriend is played by a very hunky--what little we see of him--William Hopper (of Perry Mason fame).  And his real life mother just happened to be that nasty-tongued/minded columnist Hedda Hopper.  (How he came out of *her* is something only God can explain).  And we know that if he'd brought Sterling home as his wife-to-be, Hedda would have cut her to pieces and Sterling would have run off sobbing into the night.

A much better idea: since in William's one pre-airport scene, he's shown with a ""friend"" in the wilderness he's living in--a fawn--he should have climbed up the stairs of the plane, took one look at Sterling--and then made off with the stewardess.  Because, in terms of believability, if he's attracted to fawns, a Doe would be right up his alley.

The best review for this film was given by the little boy in the movie: he slept through the whole flight.

Bottom Line: 5 Stars for the whistling and the very discerning little boy; 1 Star (if that) for everything else.",1414886400,,3032,4.597014925373134

He is always fascinating to watch.  A natural and I can never get enough of him.  He is a victim and a hero in this one and THE DUKE plays his part like the consumate actor he is.  Is it full of special effects, fighting and sex NO, but just good old acting back when the scripts really had to be well done.

  I'm not high and mighty,
  But I have what's worth,
  All the gold on earth,
  I have you and I give my heart,
  Forever and ever to you, you, you ! ""

  Song can be heard on you tube and sounds much nicer than it reads.

  I noted that someone said this film is dated.

  I don't think that's very fair.

  When this film came out, I was all of 2 years old. Now I'm 61.

  Technology in films and aircraft have changed, some for the better and some for the worse.

  But when this film was made, it was state of the art and the people in it portrayed characters who all were going down different life paths, some to death, some to a new life, some to dissolution.

  All the characters came together and we get to see how people react in a crisis where failure may result in death for them all.

  This film wasn't seen for years and with the release recently ( as was the case of the very different Island In The Sky ) we finally get to see a film that was the first Grand Hotel like film that laid the path for all other air disaster films which succeeded it.

  We see Wayne dominating the film as only he can and a supporting cast of familiar actors and actresses who show us a bit of what the old Hollywood was like when faced with the pressures brought on by television and even the inferred first instance of a couple joining what later was called "" the mile high club "".

  Hawaii is 2000+ miles away from the mainland and in those days there were no jets, you either took a passenger ship or flew taking the risk that something might occur in the air along the way.

  This film is a classic, had an Oscar winning song and had people whistling the theme for months if not years.

  You get to see a very young William Campbell as well as Robert Stack in one of his early roles. Phil Harris is great in it as are so many of the supporting cast and the stewardess was a major fashion model before and after the picture was completed.

I only have one problem with his movie. If they can re-release the picture quality in Hi-Def then they should also be about to improve the sound quality as well.

2301088,5,B0009ML2KQ,"This movie made me a Robert Stack fan.  I first saw it on TV in the late 1950s, when I was ten or eleven years old, and thought it was an excellent movie.  This was not long before Robert Stack created the role of Eliot Ness on TV in ""the Untouchables."" The High and the Mighty set the mold for airliner-disaster movies, notably the Airport series of films, which to my mind came nowhere near this one.  (And Airplane! is as much a satire of The High and the Mighty as it is of the Airport movies, and possibly owes more and pays more homage to this movie than to those later ones.)

The High and the Mighty is an old-fashioned character study, showing the reactions of flight crew and passengers to an extreme emergency situation.  It is the finest of its kind, and no one came anywhere near it until nearly fifty years later with another excellent disaster film, which depicted a true story and a truly heroic one, and that is Apollo 13.  In those crucial few minutes as the airplane reaches the coast, but experiences a communications blackout, I thought immediately of those tense minutes during the real Apollo 13 event, when the astronauts were in a communications blackout and we wondered if they were going to make it.  The High and the Mighty has the same edge-of-your-seat quality.  I made a transcontinental flight about three years after having seen The High and the Mighty on TV, flying from my home in Florida to visit relatives in California.  That flight was in a four-engine, propeller-driven airliner (jets were just coming on line as passenger aircraft and were not serving smaller airports yet), and I was mindful of the movie from one coast to the other.

I just saw this film again on our Amazon Prime account, on our 47-inch TV, and it was the first time I had seen it in color.  It's beautiful.  The characters are played by accomplished actors, making it a wonderful study.  I was alwas happy to see John Wayne in parts that had more depth than his usual cowboy or soldier action-adventure fare, and next to The Shootist, this is his finest two-and-a-half hours.  It's on my wish list, and I think 'm getting it for Christmas tomorrow.  I'm excited!

Robert Stack always was a restrained and subtle actor, one who makes you watch him to see what he's doing.  The restraint in his performance most of the way through the movie makes his fear believable when the time comes for him to begin falling apart.  It also enhances his joy when it does look like the airplane will make it safely to the ground.

Today, there is too much emphasis in movies on external action, shoot-em-up, overt sex.  This movie stands out even more than fifty years later as an insightful character study.  I also read Ernest K. Gann's book, on which this movie is based, and the film was as faithful to the book as any I've seen.  I recommend that fans of this film, or people who just appreciate it, read Gann's book, too.  That will make the movie experience even better.",1356307200,,2973,4.536585365853658

2301094,4,B0009ML2KQ,"Finally available on DVD after years of legal troubles, this is one of the least known John Wayne's movies and also one of the few, in which he deliberately accepted to play a second role.

This film was the very first ""air disaster"" movie, in which a civilian airliner finds itself in deep trouble. Made in 1954, it preceded the much more known ""Zero hour!"" (which was made in 1957) and is generally considered as an inspiration (at least partly) for the later ""Airport"" franchise - and therefore also an ancestor of the already legendary ""Airplane""...

The film begins with the boarding of passengers for a flight from Hawaii to California. The plane is a Douglas DC-4, a pretty huge four engines airliner. Passengers are relatively few and the plane will fly half empty - which allows to better know all of them during the dramatic flight. The boarding scene is a pure delight, as it is really an insight into a world long since gone...

The main hero of the film is Captain John Sullivan, played very well by Robert Stack. John Wayne plays Dan Roman, the First Officer. Dan Roman is much, much older and much more experienced than Sullivan - but both his career and his personal life were mostly destroyed years ago... Doe Avedon, a gorgeous former model, plays the Flight Attendant, Mrs Spalding - spunky, funny, charming but also very tough she is absolutely excellent in what was only her third role. Soon after this film Doe Avedon married director Don Siegel and abandoned her movie career - which I think was a pity... Passengers are a colorful bunch, with Mr Locota, for whom this is the first flight ever, being my absolute favourite.

We have some little warning shots in the beginning of the film and they are pretty well done, even if ultimately not much happens. But just after the plane passed the point of no return, one of the engines catches fire... and then things only get worse...

Now, this is a very old film and almost 60 years ago the world was different, the films were different and actors were different - and we must take all of this into account when watching it. Some situations and conversations can seem slightly funny today, especially for anybody who saw ""Airplane"" (by the way, the makers of ""Airplane"" absolutely insisted on having Robert Stack amongst the cast, precisely because of his role in ""The high and the mighty""). But still, this film really preserves a good suspense and much tension until the end. And the final scenes are quite touching, although in a way that probably could not be shown anymore in modern cinema.

I ultimately rather liked this film, even if it is not really a masterpiece and it is now slightly aged. I recommend it to all fans of John Wayne or Robert Stack - and also to all those who want to see the great ancestor of ""Airport"" and ""Airplane"" series. Enjoy!",1349136000,,2831,4.629482071713148

2301107,3,B0009ML2KQ,"This film is very much of its time, over 50 years ago. But if you can put yourself back in the days when the planes that flew from Hawaii to San Francisco used propellers and took 12 hours to make the trip, you can appreciate this movie.

John Wayne is the co-pilot, even though he's had more experience than the pilot. Why? Because a couple of years earlier he had a terrible crash. Everyone on board except him died, including his wife and son. But he's still an excellent pilot, as this trip demonstrates.

About the first half of the movie, we are getting to know the passengers, who are an interesting mix of people. Not racially mixed, though. There's one Chinese lady, but no blacks or Polynesians or other Asians, despite the fact that they are coming from Hawaii. There's one little boy flying alone because his father lives in Hawaii and his mother in San Francisco. The rest are adults, and we get to know them and their interactions pretty well, including the guy who brought a gun on board. (I TOLD you this was an old movie!) We find out why he brought the gun (hint: He's NOT a hijacker), which also tells us why he bought his ticket at the last minute.

Then one of the propellers breaks off, lighting a fire in the fuel tank of the wing it is on. Can they make it to San Francisco that way, or have to ditch?

With John Wayne at the controls, how can you doubt? But it is pretty harrowing, and gets very involved with the emotional states of everyone on board.",1337126400,,1477,4.340579710144928

2301127,2,B0009ML2KQ,"When Leonard Maltin in the introduction advises the viewer to suspend time and travel back to the fifties, warning bells rang straight away for me.  This dreadful film simply does not stand up. The script is hopeless and while some of the acting is OK (Jan Sterling, Laraine Day and Phil Harris of all people), most is awful (Robert Stack takes the booby prize). This is not an aviation thriller, even if the prescursor to later and much better ""Disaster Movies"", but a multi-star melodrama in the vein of ""Grand Hotel"" or ""Executive Suite."" It is a long hard slog with excruciating dialogue and cliched corny situations. John Wayne survives simply because his part is relatively small and he retains a degree of sobriety. The film is hilarious if one thinks of ""Flying High."" The director William Wellman does a competent job of holding all the multiple subplots together but as a director who specialised in action packed aviation films, surely he was dispirited by the histrionics (or lack thereof).  The best thing is the epic theme music which justly won an Oscar.

The good news, however, is that the print has been lovingly restored and the colour and sound are spectacular. There are many extras included in the package but they are surprisingly lacking in much detail and rather dull.

All in all, this is a fair package of a genuine dud. Watch at your peril.",1315958400,,1368,4.7594936708860756

2301135,5,B0009ML2KQ,"Pilot Dan Roman (John Wayne), who had been flying planes since 1917, and who had taken part in the Allied bombing of the Ploesti oilfields during WWII, is on a routine Honolulu to San Francisco Flight. The routine aspect disappears just halfway into the flight.

First, the plane has episodes of vibration. Then a passenger shoots at another, puncturing fuel tanks and setting one of the engines on fire. The fire goes out, but the engine is not only disabled but also distorted, causing additional drag on the plane. The crew is frank with the passengers about the magnitude of the emergency. For now, the crew manages to keep the plane airborne.

Some passengers are horror-stricken. Others resort to gallows humor. One woman, for instance, faces her impending death with the satisfaction that she will never have to be an old woman. A couple on the verge of divorce reconciles.

The passengers and crew prepare for a landing in the water. The water is very rough, and the plane could sink in minutes instead of hours. The navigator makes a serious miscalculation as to the plane's location. The pilot, certain that the fuel is all but gone, initiates a water landing. But pilot Dan Roman has other ideas...",1257033600,,1209,4.802884615384615

At the time I was only 4 or 5 years old and was sitting through the movie by myself. I was so impressed by how cool John Wayne was, in the picture, that I actually ended up sitting through the whole movie and then even watched the second showing. To this day, at 60, I can still recall well how on the way home, during my two mile hike, I would whistle the tune John Wayne would whistle through out the film. I had instantly became a John Wayne fan from watching the movie, twice yet. I would hope younger folks of today could watch the older 1954 movie and get into the excellent acting the cast of the movie did.

2301152,3,B0009ML2KQ,"They say that absence makes the heart grow fonder, and certainly there's nothing like a film being unavailable for years to help build up its reputation to near-mythical status without having to worry about the film itself shattering the illusion. Case in point The High and The Mighty. The biggest hit of 1954 and one of the first major disaster movies, for a couple of decades or more rights issues and a lengthy restoration process kept the film out of circulation and alive only in the fond memory of those who saw it in their youth. It's not just less impressive than director William Wellman, co-star John Wayne and novelist/screenwriter Ernest K. Gann's previous collaboration Island in the Sky, it's not very good at all. Now that the novelty has gone with six decades of airplane-in-jeopardy movies, much of what's left is clumsily executed hokum with a low-octane cast playing a planeload of annoying and extraordinarily badly written stereotypes facing a swim home when an engine catches fire and their plane loses the extra fuel it needs to make it to dry land. While Leonard Maltin warns in his DVD introduction that it's ""a film very much of it's time,"" even in 1954 this was remarkably unsubtle stuff and it really should be a lot better than it is: money has been spent and there's a lot of talent in the credits, with Wellman and Gann's own aviation experience promising much more than an overlong soap opera in the sky with dialogue and characterisation so risible that even Irwin Allen would have rejected it..

Most of the more prominent names in the cast - Claire Trevor's beaten up broad who ""never quite managed to make it legal"" and Robert Newton's Broadway producer and nervous flier who finds himself an unlikely voice of calm in particular - have little to do and not much screen time to do it in. Wayne's veteran co-pilot still traumatised by the crash that killed his wife and child (""The only man I know with the courage not to kill himself"") doesn't have a great deal to do either for most of the film, and it's all too easy to see why first choice Spencer Tracey (among other big stars sought for the passengers) turned the picture down. The presence of a sweating Robert Stack as the pilot at the controls ""whose nerves of steel are starting to rust"" brings up unhelpful memories of Airplane! for modern audiences, with only Doe Avedon (rather misleadingly billed in the trailer as ""a right gal who had to be nice to a lot of wrong people!"") making much of a positive impression as the plane's stewardess. Most of the rest of the cast are so annoying that it's the kind of film where you're rooting for the engine failure. It's hard not to agree with Lenny Bruce, who mercilessly lampooned the film in his 'Non-Skeddo Airlines' routine, that if they really wanted to lighten the plane they should have ditched the irritating 'cute' kid while he was asleep.

Very obviously shot almost entirely on the studio lot, the film only briefly kicks into life when Wellman gets to go on location to shoot the various rescue services preparing for the worst, but even these scenes are let down by the distinctly underwhelming big finale. Perhaps the most surprising thing about the film today is the amount of lightweight smut which, though tame today, does push the envelope of what was acceptable within the confines of the all-too easily offended Breen Office's censorship demands of the day - Phil Harris and his wife find themselves the target of a wife-swapping couple at their Hawaiian hotel while nauseating young newlyweds John Smith and Karen Sharpe decide that if they're going to die they may as well go out with a bang.

Aside from the grotty looking title sequence, the DVD transfer is quite superb, working wonders on the usually highly variable WarnerColor system and the lack of detail that was such a problem with the early 2.55:1 CinemaScope lenses. There's an excellent extras package too that's worth the price of the disc on its own, including a decent featurette on Dimtri Tiomkin, whose memorable score is one of the best things about the picture and was played at the Duke's funeral. It's just a shame that the film itself is so hokey.",1200528000,,4183,4.719562243502052
2301153,5,B0009ML2KQ,"Wayne, that incredible cast, brilliant color photography, and Tiomkin's haunting theme music (unfortunately the lyrics of the title song aren't sung during the film, that would come later when the great Johnny Desmond recorded it as a hit single) make this one of the greatest films of all.  When Tiomkin's theme blasts over the opening credits against a blue sky background, you know it will be a great plane ride.  50s Boomers will remember that in the ""I Love Lucy"" episode where Lucy meets Wayne, Lucy as well expresses her admiration for this epic.  She tells Wayne, ""When your engine conked out [in the film], I did, too!""  John is great as that old pelican, ""Whistlin' Dan"" who saves the plane, and the day, when copilot Robert Stack freezes up.

This film has some impressive cinematography, and several very suspenseful scenes, but in all honesty, it's really a melodramatic, 50s style soap-opera that wasn't very well written or well acted by the cast.
There are, however, two things that really lift this film out of mediocre territory.
The beautiful and haunting score, and the electrifying presence of John Wayne. The Duke dominates every scene he is in, and he's the main reason modern viewers keep watching this very dated film. When the movie is over, the viewer doesn't want to say it was average because of the efforts and accomplishments of Wayne. This may have been a ""big and adventurous"" film back in it's day, but in the year of 2007, it's entertainment value comes strictly from it's ""big and adventurous"" lead star.

2301175,5,B0009ML2KQ,"Being a classic movie fan born 5 years after this film's initial release, I have always heard about it, read about it, even saw a parody of its title (in a WB cartoon -- I think featuring Tweety -- called ""The High and the Flighty""), but have never seen it (nor heard the beautiful theme song), and felt I never would after John Wayne's death and hearing it was locked up in his estate.  In summer 2005 I went to a video store and the minute I saw the title, I knew I had to have it.  It's clearly a picture of its times, and the granddaddy of the ""Airport"" movies that followed in the 70s.

A couple of reviewers talked about how campy TH&TM is; well, I guess after you've seen all the ""Airport"" movies and the parody ""Airplane"", and almost anticipating every move in the picture, TH&TM would seem a bit quaint and campy.  Naturally, the producers didn't intend for it to be that way, but remember, this was air travel circa 1954; if you're going to create the disaster film genre, you have to begin somewhere.  (Actually there was a Jimmy Stewart-Marlene Dietrich movie about a doomed plane called No Highway in the Sky that came out a few years before TH&TM.)  Also, commercial flying was in its infancy and there were no commercial jet planes, people smoked on planes then, kids openly carried toy guns (and naturally no security checkpoints), and commercial jet flights didn't come around until the late 50's and early 60's.  And, of course, movies had to compete with TV to get people back into theatres with CinemaScope, Technicolor and stereo sound.  The 50s were also a time when the story -- not the special effects -- sold a movie.  TH&TM was a best-seller, enough cachet to make a good movie.

So TH&TM is a reflection of the 50's -- and a very good one.  I'm glad to finally see it.  Now if I can find the book . . . .",1157760000,7,1831,4.368731563421829
2301176,3,B0009ML2KQ,"I saw this movie when it was first released.  I was 12.  I remember being amazed even then at how effectively the cinematographer utilized the ultra-wide screen even though most of the film took place in the cramped passenger quarters of a commercial airliner.  His skill in doing that is every bit as evident today in this vibrant restoration.

It's the look of the movie, I think, plus its majestic score, that are largely responsible for the film's past and present popularity.  And it's somehow comforting to know that this prime example how movies evolved to compete with TV in the 50's has now been preserved for all time.  I think it's also true that the High and the Mighty carries with it a not-completely-explicable mystique that few other 50's movies can come close to matching.

The fact remains, though, that this is not a very good movie and despite it's enormous success at the box office, serious critics of the day lambasted the film in a way that's very similar to contemporary reviews of the DVD on [..]  In 1954, Bosley Crowther of the N.Y. Times complained about the corniness of the plot and the emptiness and banality of the back-stories of the passengers and crew.  The dialogue in particular, is often achingly bad and it's hard to believe that it was crafted by Ernest K, Gann, a competent writer who did this screen adaptation of his own best seller.  So let's not chalk up all of the film's creakiness to its age; dialogue that sounds shallow and contrived today sounded just as bad in 1954.

Some of the performances are decent.  Wayne, as usual, is great and I thought Jan Sterling, David Brian, Claire Trevor, and Paul Kelly were all pretty good.  Even non movie star Phil Harris, though saddled with some of the most grating lines in the film, is fun to watch.  The worst performance, in my opinion, is Robert Newton's, who seems to be completely tuned out to the proceedings and attempts to make his performance interesting by simply failing to make eye contact with the actors who are speaking to him.

The extra disk, which contains the ""special features,"" has been praised to the skies (no pun) by many of the reviewers on this site.  Personally, I found almost everything on this disk to be overly brief and disappointing.  The restoration segment, in particular, had little to say and even less to show.  While congratulating themselves for the stunning restoration, the restorers tell us, almost in a whisper, that the color separation negatives were found and used to restore the film.  Separation negatives were black and white ""color masks"" that were rarely made, except on expensive films that were expected to be re-released from time to time.  Getting a gorgeous color print from a separation negative is not quite as big a deal as the restoration team would like us to believe. That's what the separation negatives were for: restoration.  And the availability of these negatives is the main reason why this DVD looks so wonderful.

In spite of all my nit picking, however, I'd recommend buying this DVD if you are a Baby Boomer or older and have nostalgic memories of the movie and its era.",1157587200,14,3136,4.736648250460405
2301187,5,B0009ML2KQ,"As it happens, his film had a strong influence on my life - I went on to become an airline pilot, so it was wonderful after so many years to see it again. As one of the first films of this type one has to remember that many of the cliches of later ""disaster"" films originated with this one. The tension created in this small space is astonishing. Technically there are one or two minor lapses but these do not detract from the drama. Robert Stack's character is particularly truthfully drawn. The film faithfully creates the atmosphere of commercial flight aided by some great music and photography.

Despite improvements in technology the film reminds me that the human challenges of flight haven't changed at all.",1152921600,4,715,4.72
2301188,5,B0009ML2KQ,"For many years all that remained of ""The High and the Mighty"" was its famous theme tune, composed by Dmitri Timokin and supposedly whistled by John Wayne.  The film itself was unavailable, supposedly literally fading into obscurity due its unstable color process.  Indeed, when the film had last appeared on network television, it was quite obvious that the once-vibrant colors of this magnificent production were almost washed out.  The film was succumbing to the fate of numerous color films and there appeared to be little that could be done to save it.

""The High and the Mighty"" was filmed in Warner Color, Warner Brothers' attempt to produce a more economical process to compete with the expensive Technicolor film used in numerous American films.  Unfortunately, this color process did not hold up very well after many years and it was appeared the film would never be seen again.  It might very well have become a ""lost"" masterpiece.

When I first saw the film I was quite impressed with everything about it: the very fine, diverse cast; the dramatic story; the memorable musical score; and even the color.  It is wonderful that the film has been fully restored and may even look better than it did when it was first released in 1954.

For those of us who are true fans of John Wayne, the release on DVD of ""The High and the Mighty"" has been a welcome addition to our collections of the Duke's films.  When the film was made, Wayne was enjoying a very good, profitable relationship with Jack Warner and the result were a series of mostly memorable films during the 1950s.

In many ways this film is a virtual ""time capsule"" of a much different era in which flying, especially over the ocean, was still very much an adventure.  Vintage photos also show that passengers took flying, especially for long distances, quite seriously and treated it as a very formal occasion.  Thus, men wore suits and ties and women wore very fancy dresses.  That can be clearly seen in this film.  One has to marvel that some women could somehow wear the full skirts and petticoats of that time and fit into an airplane seat!

Before the advent of commercial jets, flying was much longer and slower.  It took many hours to fly from Honolulu to San Francisco and this film successfully conveys that.  This is NOT a routine flight, however, and the real drama comes when an altercation develops during the flight that affects the fate of everyone on board the plane.  It reaches the point where the viewer wonders if the plane will actually make it to San Francisco.

Director William Wellman, sometimes called ""Wild Bill,"" was, from all accounts, a very colorful, imaginative, and even gifted director who had a great love and appreciation for flying.  He was a pilot in World War I and later depicted some of his experiences and impressions of early aerial warfare in the first film to win a Best Picture Oscar, the 1927 Paramount production ""Wings"" with Charles ""Buddy Rogers, Richard Arlen, Clara Bow, Hedda Hopper (who later became a nationally-syndicated gossip columnists), and even a very young Gary Cooper!  Flying was a feature in future Wellman films, including his very last film, the 1958 production ""Lafayette Escadrille.""

Wellman clearly had a good relationship with John Wayne; they again worked together a year later in another Warner Brothers film, ""Blood Alley,"" which teamed Wayne with Lauren Bacall.  This film was a Batjac production, the company Wayne cofounded to produce many of his films; it took its name from a fictional company in one of John Wayne's Republic films.

The film features a very fine cast, including Claire Trevor, Laraine Day, Robert Stack, Jan Sterling, Robert Newton, Phil Harris, Paul Kelly, John Qualen, Regis Toomey, Paul Fix, and Douglas Fowley.  They all contribute their unique qualities to the unfolding drama that makes this such a memorable film.

The DVD set also includes a number of special features that clearly show how the film was made, how it was restored, what it was like to work with both John Wayne and William Wellman, how Batjac was created, and so on.  There are excellent commentaries by Leonard Maltin, who is regularly seen on ""Entertainment Tonight"" and who must be one of the greatest film authorities of all.

Amazingly, John Wayne continues to attract new fans through the release on home video of most of his major films, as well as some of his early productions when he struggled to make a name for himself in Hollywood after being virtually neglected by his mentor John Ford.  Fortunately, Ford finally rescued Wayne from grade ""B' Westerns and gave him a featured role in the 1939 film ""Stagecoach,"" establishing Wayne as a major star. (One of Wayne's costars from that historic film, Claire Trevor, has a prominent role in this film.)  There is so much to see among the John Wayne films and this is one of the best of them all.",1151020800,5,4895,4.812425328554361

  Sporting a superb cast headed by Mr. Wayne and the magnificent score by Dimitri Tiomkin this motion picture may be old but in no way is it dull or boring. The action is interspersed with the souls on board and their reaction to crisis. For film buffs of that period there is not one actor here you won't recognize. An exceptional performance by Robert Stack. A surprising stint by Phil Harris. Good stuff from Jan Sterling and Claire Trevor. The venerable Robert Newton having a mid-life resurrection. All, of course, being held intact by Big John himself.

2301191,4,B0009ML2KQ,"""The High and The Mighty"" had this aura of a legendary, beloved lost epic, out of the public eye for decades. It was supposedly this great film from the 50's that everyone loved (it was the top money winner the year of release) but could no longer see secondary to rights issues.

It's the seminal disaster film. It's the first one with a group of colorful people, trapped together in some calamity, where drama ensues. The movie poster had each actor's photo in a little box running along the bottom. Without this film, there would be no ""Airport"", ""Towering Inferno"", ""Poseidon Adventure.""

I leave it to you whether or not you think that's a good thing.

John Wayne is the ""lead"", although he doesn't have as much screen time as you'd imagine. The cast includes Robert Stack, Claire Trevor and a bunch of character actors you'll recognize. One guy you'll know as the voice of Baloo.

I realize the film is from the 50's, but I thought the acting was cheesy even for that era. This plane is filled with more hams than a butcher shop. The dialogue is laughable; check out the Asian character's lines. I dare you not to wince. Robert Stack's overly serious voice-overs, letting you know what he's thinking, made me laugh out loud. Some times I got the feeling I was watching ""Airplane"" and forgot that this was all supposed to be serious.

The plot itself is actually pretty good. I loved the look at air travel in the 50's. It's a time machine experience. There's a fair amount of suspense built up as well, as they try to make it to San Francisco from Hawaii. The discussion of ditching the plane in the ocean, in such a manner that you feel it was a commonplace option at the time, is often harrowing.

The extras are pretty sweet, giving you a great picture of how the film was made, the era in which it was shown, it's historical significance, and what the airline industry was like in it's infancy.

It's a great DVD package, but the film itself is kind of a goofy epic.",1143590400,14,1976,4.487465181058496
2301192,5,B0009ML2KQ,"The High and the Mighty is a very entertaining film that is well worth the two hours-plus that it takes to get through it. As many other reviewers have already summarized the main plot points, I'll skip that in my own review and stick to a brief recommendation that you won't be disappointed by it.

John Wayne is in the movie, and he is obviously the star (followed closely by a young and incredibly interesting Robert Stack), and yet he doesn't overwhelm the movie with an over-the-top performance. In other words, the viewer won't be thinking to him or herself, ""how much Duke is too much Duke?""

The other characters' back-stories and various crisises are total cliches now, though at the time of the movie's release they were probably more original. Original or hackneyed, the assorted personal dramas and physical air disaster are still interesting.

The main musical score is memorable and very listenable, but the rest of the score seems a bit ""too obvious"" and bombastic when there's a dramatic point in the film, or an emotional moment. As in, ""oh, the music got really, really romantic, so this should be a romantic scene."" Some of the dialog also seems contrived, though again, the movie is still very interesting.

Some of the language and stereotypes might not go over too well today, but in the context of the film are acceptable.

Examples:

- everyone, especially the flight crew, seems to be smoking cigarettes, even on

  duty

- stereotyped gender roles, especially in terms of calm men and hysterical

  women

- the only asian passenger in the movie is a quiet, extremely respectful woman

  who speaks perfect english, but does so in a ponderous manner to various

  Americans who condescend to her, and she is given to reflecting in a

  stereotypical fashion on her culture and past.

- the southern-european fisherman passenger is given to wild gesticulations

  whenever he speaks, and might as well be rolling pizza dough the way they

  portray him

- the stewardess (as flight attendants were then called) jokingly refers to the

  average American girl as a ""retard.""

These stereotypes, even though they're in the movie, still don't detract from the entertainment value of the film -- in fact, they help put it into the historical context of the time it was made, and the situation it was depicting.

the DVD extras, far from being ""throwaway"" and a mere hike on the price of the movie you really want to pay for, are actually very interesting, especially the mini-documentaries on John Wayne's film company, and the history of passenger flight in the 1950s.",1143504000,4,2590,4.8466819221967965

2301207,5,B0009ML2KQ,"The first time I saw this picture was the only time Cinemax ran it and since that time a poor VHS copy made off the cable (4 hour mode and monophonic linear sound track) has been one of my ""treasures"".  Before the official DVD was released I had made a DVD copy of that VHS tape to preserve it.

The new collector's DVD is a very well restored version of the movie.  The only thing it is missing is the song in the soundtrack which WAS present for a few days of the movie's theatre run to allow the song to compete for an award.  It was missing in most of the theatre run, and in it's few TV showings.  I wish they had restored it to the collector's edition DVD, or at least included it on the second ""extras"" disk.

The movie is true to the novel (the author of the book also penned the screen play).  As a private pilot myself I can relate to the story.  If you've never flown a plane with a constant speed prop you probably didn't understand what Dan did with the controls to save fuel, but they got it right in the movie.

He lowered the propeller RPM by increasing the pitch of the props and then applied full throttle.  This is sort-of like running your car on overdrive, it's harder on the engine but it saves fuel.

This restored version may have some extra footage over the version I've seen on TV (If my memory serves me).  The colors are bright and even the darker shots at night are clear. The sound track is great and has quite a depth of surround when run through a dolby 5.1 decoder.  It's been a long wait, but well worth it.",1139011200,4,1541,4.148148148148148
2301208,5,B0009ML2KQ,"When ""The High and the Mighty"" came out in 1954 the vast majority of people had never been in an airplane.  In fact, heavier than air flight was only 51 years old (it has been 51 years since 1954!).  However, it was only nine years since the end of WWII and the year after the Korean War ended, the airlines were growing, and the public was starting to travel to exotic places like Hawaii in propeller airplanes (jet travel for passengers didn't follow until the fifties ended and the sixties were under way).

This movie, dealing with a passenger flight that is at risk of having to ditch at sea, was a frightening concept to most people.  John Wayne produced the movie and was not supposed to have a role in the film.  However, Spencer Tracey turned down the Dan Roman role and Wayne took over.  The film was a huge hit and played for two years in New York's Time Square and was nominated for six Oscars.

This movie also began a film genre that continued for decades and culminated in the Airport films of the 1970s and then became a parody in the Airplane! movies.  From out vantage point, when flying in an airplane is about as glamorous as riding in a bus to summer camp, the interior shots seem far too spacious (although seats were bigger in those days), the inside dimensions are just too big for prop planes or even today's jets.  The exterior shots of the plane bobbing in the wind and rain with engines roaring then switching to a quiet interior where people can whisper to each other and be heard would only be believed by anyone who had never flown (which was everyone in those days).  But this cutting was made very funny in the first Airplane! movie.

This is a long film, about two and a half hours, and most of it focuses on the personal problems and relationships of the folks in the back of the plane, the crew, and how Wayne's washed up character fares with the Captain (Robert Stack) who disdains him.  All of this was copied again and again with different twists over the years and depends on the way these details hold the audience.  However, remember this was the original airplane disaster flick and The Duke pulls it off quite well (he made a couple of pots of money from this thing).",1137369600,2,2211,4.42962962962963
2301209,5,B0009ML2KQ,"This film has an almost angelic and spiritual look about it. John Wayne gives one of his best performances as Dan Roman a man who relives a tragic past as an airline pilot.

Director William ""Wild Bill"" Wellman a veteran World War I flyer turns in a monumentally suspenseful and emotionally charged adventure.

The cinematography is breathtaking, ominous yet calming giving one the impression that faith and the best qualities of man will persevere. This is classic filmmaking.

2301210,4,B0009ML2KQ,"1954's ""The High And The Mighty"", directed by William Wellman, has proven to be a tough movie for me to attach a specific grade to. I'm kind of stuck on the fence. I can certainly appreciate the several wonderful aspects of this good old-fashioned ""disaster-in-the-sky"" melodrama -- for example:

> That irresistible Dimitri Tiomkin signature theme music used for the Main Titles.

> The extra-wide ""CinemaScope"" framing of the film. This must have been one of the very first movies photographed in this wide aspect ratio, which measures a little wider than the 2.35:1 that I've seen advertised for this DVD. The Widescreen image measures 2.41:1 on my TV screen.

> The bold, warm color photography (which looks absolutely terrific on this gorgeous 2-Disc ""Special Collector's Edition"" DVD, which represents this film's very first home-video release of any kind).

> Some nice aerial shots of the four-engined propliner in flight.

> A good tension-filled ""will they ditch or make it to the airport?"" climax.

> A humorous bit part for Pedro Gonzales-Gonzales, who first appeared in the public eye as a very funny contestant on the Groucho Marx TV show, ""You Bet Your Life"", in 1953. That ""YBYL"" program with Gonzales-Gonzales is also available on DVD (via one of the multi-disc compilations of that TV series that has been issued by ""Shout! Factory""). A very funny episode too, with Pedro's last name(s) being the subject of a few of Groucho's sharp-tongued wisecracks.

> Robert Stack getting bitch-slapped by big John Wayne.

> And, of course, ""The Duke"" himself, which makes any film rise a little bit higher on the 'watchable' scale, just by seeing his name on the marquee. (John Wayne was 46 when he made this movie.)

------------

But, there are some drawbacks and debit points that counteract those plusses listed above (just in my own opinion of course). Debits such as:

> The somewhat heavy and overdone background music during some portions of the movie. Although, as mentioned, the main theme is priceless and one-of-a-kind.

> The awkward, choppy, and rather disjointed soap-opera-like storylines revolving around the airplane's passengers. Some of these ""mini dramas"" re. the 21 or 22 passengers on the Honolulu-to-San Francisco flight just don't ring very true. And some of these ""vignettes"" seem to spring up out of nowhere, without much rhyme or reason for them.

At times, it seems as if the characters are delivering ""monologues"", rather than engaging in one-on-one conversations. Plus, there's the fact that very few of these 20+ people are really all that likeable.

And the script is full of hot-and-cold inconsistencies......

Laraine Day seems to be asking for the back of her husband's hand in some of her scenes here (although the hubby is very restrained when receiving Laraine's spiteful invective and keeps his hands off and his mouth shut during her theatrical tirades).

But, via the magic of a movie script, Laraine's character does a complete (almost impossibly-fast) turnabout by the end of the film, as she suddenly becomes all smiles and kisses. Just didn't ring entirely true to me. But, as the saying goes, it's a woman's prerogative to change her mind. ;) (At any rate, it was nice seeing Laraine finally lose her frown and sour disposition and crack a smile near the tail-end of the picture.)

Robert Newton's character goes through a similar transformation at the drop of a hat, too -- with Newton's fear of flying so great at the start of the film, he is gripped with terror at the slightest turning of the plane (so says the stewardess, who asks pilot Bob Stack to go and calm down this white-knuckled flyer). And yet, somehow, after the calamitous engine failure (and now facing the prospect of plunging to a watery grave), Newton is suddenly perfectly composed and unfrightened. Not the slightest bit on edge. He even helps to calm down another passenger aboard the plane. Remarkable. And unbelievable.

> The lack of much ""background"" story provided on either one of the main pilots (Wayne or Stack). Via a third-party acquaintance of ""Dan Roman"" (Wayne), we do hear the story of how Roman got his bum leg in an earlier airplane crash which he, alone, survived. But other than one very brief ""flashback"" showing Wayne emerging from some burning wreckage, we really don't get involved at all in Wayne's character. And that's a pity. Because I think more background/flashback scenes with Wayne would have elevated his part more and would have benefitted the script better than, say, the weak subplot attached to comedian Phil Harris' character (and his hysterical wife, whom I'm guessing many viewers of this film wished had gone down in the sea by the final reel).

> Robert Stack's character is another negative IMO. I think Robert did a good job with his role here however. But, for most of the film, it looked like Stack was either ready to (pardon the pun) blow his ""stack"", or to spit nails. I guess maybe Bob picked the wrong week to stop sniffing glue or something. (Oops, wrong airplane flick.) ;)

> And that little boy who must have taken a whole bottle of sleeping pills before boarding ""Flight #420"". He never wakes up throughout the whole tumultuous ordeal in the air! This kid sleeps through turbulence, screaming passengers all around him, gun-waving fisticuffs in the aisle, and even the no-doubt deafening roar of having one of the plane's doors opened while in flight (yet another ""can you imagine this today?"" moment in the picture -- a cabin door being opened while in flight to lighten the aircraft's load by tossing all the luggage into the Pacific Ocean!). It's a rather humorous notion today indeed...especially when you consider that you'd be sucked out of the plane instantly if you were to crack open the hatch of a Boeing 747 while the plane is in the air and pressurized.

I suppose, however, the fact that Flight 420 only reached a fairly-low maximum altitude of 8,000 or 9,000 feet (per the lone stewardess' remarks made to a passenger at the start of the flight) made the safe opening of a door a realistic part of the screenplay. But it's kind of funny to see it nonetheless.

> The overlength of the movie (2 hours, 27 minutes). It could have been tightened-up and had at least 30 to 40 minutes chopped out of it, and it still wouldn't have been any the worse for wear as a result of such trimming, IMHO.

------------

So, when the reviewing dust has settled, I think I'm right about in the ""3.5 to 3.75 Stars"" range for ""The High And The Mighty"". That grand theme song deserves a full ""5 Stars"" though. And via this disc's rich Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround soundtrack, the opening credits are blissful. There's a DD 2.0 Surround track too. No Mono track offered up however. The title theme also can be heard (on a continuous loop) while the DVD's Main Menu is on the screen. Sounds darn good there as well.

On a different note ......

This film can be a pretty funny experience to watch in today's 21st-century environment (which is filled with fears of terrorists slipping aboard commercial jetliners and the stringent security at all U.S. airports). But in ""Mighty"", passengers can just walk aboard Hawaii-to-California flights armed with handguns in their coat pockets, with one such disgruntled passenger in the movie doing just that, as he packs a rod on the plane in the hope of settling a score with a fellow passenger while in flight. And even after the gun is taken away from this guy in a fight, not a thing is done by the Captain or the crew about the weapon for the duration of the flight -- with the gun-wielding passenger even getting back his pistol by the end of the movie. Can you picture that in your mind today?! You can't even take a plastic butter knife on board an airplane nowadays. LOL.

And then there's the unintended ""smoking"" humor provided throughout the film. Passengers and (especially) the cockpit crew are just a-smokin' the cigarettes like chimneys during their flight to San Francisco! Obviously, this was indeed commonplace in the 1950s. But it's another example of how ""dated"" movies of such an era can become. Can you imagine seeing your pilot and co-pilot emerging from the cockpit, both of them puffin' away on their Camels and Winstons while the plane is in the air? :)

It's difficult to not compare ""TH&TM"" with other disaster outings that would follow in its wake (""wake turbulence"" even?). Such as ""Airport"" (from 1970), which in my view has more positive things going for it, and is a better film (overall) than this one. For one thing, the ground-based airport scenes in ""Airport"" are far superior to those in ""TH&TM"". Plus, I believe the story and character development in that later aviation flick are better too.

This double-disc DVD edition of ""The High And The Mighty"" contains a goodly amount of bonus features (in addition to the great-looking Anamorphic Widescreen video transfer of the movie on Disc 1). There's a multi-person Audio Commentary Track for the film on the first disc, while Disc #2 contains a wealth of supplementary material -- including a multi-part ""Making Of"" program, an aviation featurette, newsreel footage of the film's 1954 premiere, trailers, introductions by film critic Leonard Maltin, and a photo gallery.

One of the bonus items is a 23-minute featurette called ""Flying In The Fifties"", which contains interviews with some old-time pilots and some vintage film footage of a few of the airliners from that era, including the majestic-looking ""Constellation"". One of the retired pilots made a quip during this program that had me chuckling. When reflecting on the question of why he became an airline pilot, he said -- ""Where else are you going to get a job where they give you a multi-million-dollar airplane, fill it full of booze and women, and send you out of town?"" ~LOL~

A Last ""Mighty"" Word (or two).......

Warts and all, ""The High And The Mighty"" still has the capacity to entertain an audience, and will immerse the viewer in high-flying, peril-filled, 1950s-style drama for nearly two-and-a-half hours.

So hop aboard Flight 420 to San Francisco and fly along with John Wayne. Or, better yet, just pick up a copy of this beautiful and well-crafted 2-Disc DVD set from Paramount Home Entertainment. It should easily satisfy anybody's ""High & Mighty"" cravings.",1131321600,3,10363,4.882118451025057

After seeing it again on DVD, I really have to say my opinion has improved on this film. Looking at it from a historical perspective, I think this film is very entertaining. Even the stories that we see in each of the characters that are on the plain seems intersting to me. They seem to help build the suspence at the end.

Is this one of John Wayne's best?  No, but is a very good film and I really enjoyed it. I'm glad that this film is back where we can see it again.",1129852800,3,614,3.904

The High and the Mighty is the first movie I actually remember seeing.  I had remembered the essence of the story fairly well, and recalled that the sound track had wonderfully captured the drama of the story.  Seeing it after 50 years was quite exciting and I found myself drawn into a reasonably successful effort in character development for the story.  The movie can't compete with modern fast action, quick cut, special effects driven films, and it shouldn't.  The story is not about a life-threatening aircraft failure, but how the crew and passengers respond to it an each other.  Special effects and caffeine-driven direction techniques would add little, if anything.

Granted, my high rating is influenced some by memories of my youth, but it is still a wonderful movie.  And seeing cowboy John Wayne as a convincing pilot helped validate my appreciation of the actor.",1129075200,3,1066,4.883333333333334
2301216,4,B0009ML2KQ,"There are a number of things that come to mind in reviewing ""The High and the Mighty""; the luxury of flying commercial airlines back then, the precursor to ""Airport"", etc.  However, the primary impression I got (and I assume others get as well) is the power of John Wayne's preformance.  He plays the pilot whose second fiddle status suggests a darkened incident in his past.  He is jovial and confident enough to accept his place.  However, when the prospect of disaster presents itself, it is he who shows the strength and courage to face the dangers while coolly taking control of the situation.  Much of the film is dawdled away with a soap opera-like examination of the passengers and their ""issues"".  We never seem to endear ourselves to the other passengers but, afterall, we came to see the Duke in action.  This is not his best role but it is as good a role as any to showcase his unique talent.  Wayne's strength is in his quiet yet forceful command and self-confidence.  This is the man we want in charge, this is the man who calms our fears and leads us to safety/victory/success.  It's good that this very good movie was released after being out of circulation for many years.  I had seen it quite a while ago.

2301230,3,B0009ML2KQ,"If ever a Hollywood movie was locked into its period (1954), this is it. ""The High and the Mighty"" is about passengers and crew aboard a plane in peril from Honolulu to San Francisco. It was produced by its star, John Wayne, who surrounded himself with name actors (among them, Claire Trevor, with whom he acted in John Ford's ""Stagecoach,"" his classic breakthrough). It was based on the best-seller by Ernest Gann and directed by William Wellman right after directing Wayne in Gann's ""Island in the Sky."" The movie made a lot of money and earned a half-dozen Oscer nods, winning one for its music by Dimitri Tiomkin.

Does it fly today? No. But it is watchable in an oh-no! sort of way. The exposition is clumsy, the dialogue alternates between clich and corny, the characters are stereotypes and awkwardly introduced, the music is turbulent when Wayne isn't whistling it (yes!), and the special effects aren't anything special. In fact, its great virtue is the appreciation it gives viewers for the advances Hollywood has made in producing potboilers and in technical competence. There's a reason they don't make movies like this anymore. Still, we couldn't have gotten here from there without first having gone there, and the trip back is sometimes campy fun.

Co-pilot Wayne quite literally slaps some sense into pilot Robert Stack, who thanks him for it. Party girl Trevor, taking the red eye in a blue evening gown, flashes a leg garter and flirts with tycoon David Brian; Sidney Blackmer tries to shoot Brian for once flirting with his wife. A troubled physicist comforts aging Jan Sterling, who removes her makeup and orders him to ""look at my face"" (gasp!) Comedian Phil Harris grins incessantly and fails to calm his hysterical wife. A poor fisherman and a Chinese immigrant are somehow flying first class. Through it all, newlyweds neck and a little boy sleeps soundly. Don't try to fight liking all this. You can't win.",1127001600,8,1931,4.884146341463414
2301231,5,B0009ML2KQ,"The High and The Mighty may not be the first all-star airline suspense disaster film; that was probably Five Came Back (1939), but it certainly fits neatly between that one and Doomsday Flight as one of the best of the genre before Airport.  Wlilliam Wellman's direction is fine, but the cast and Dimitri Tiomkin's score are outstanding.  I always remembered this as the one where John Wayne whistles the haunting theme several times during the film (the special features on the DVD include a revelation about that).

The film was unavailable for decades - never released on video (I came across a collector's copy recorded from TV or somewhere for $50 a few years ago, and they wouldn't even guarantee it was complete).  So it's about time they released it on DVD, and they did a fine job, too, the video quality looks great and there are plenty of interesting special features.

The plot follows the stories of several passengers and crew aboard a flight from Hawaii to San Francisco when something goes wrong - an engine burns and they calculate they won't make it to land, in any direction.  The suspense mounts as the pilot (Robert Stack, best known as Ellott Ness on The Untouchables) plans to ditch in the ocean, but the co-pilot (John Wayne) wants to try to make it by conserving fuel.  It turns out the navigator (Wally Brown, who I remember from at least one episode of Perry Mason) made an error and it will be too close to call.

A number of great actors play the passengers, including Claire Trevor (Stage Coach, Key Largo), Larraine Day, Phil Harris (The Jack Benny Radio Program, Goodbye My Lady, The Jungle Book),  Robert Newton (Long John Silver in Disney's Treasure Island), John Howard, John Qualen (who appeared in many John Wayne films including The Searchers, The Long Voyage Home, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence),  Ann Doran, Paul Fix (also a regular in John Wayne films including Island In The Sky, but better known as Mica in The Rifleman).  Other familiar faces in the cast include William Campbell (Trelane on the Star Trek episode The Squire Of Gothos, and other episodes) Douglas Fowley, Regis Toomey, Carl 'Alfalfa' Switzer (of The Little Rascals - he also appeared in Island In The Sky), William Hopper (Goodbye My Lady, Perry Mason), William Schallert (Flat Top, The Patty Duke Show) and many others.",1126915200,,2334,4.781094527363184

The true movie buff will love this 2 disc set, as much for the movie as the extras on the second dvd.

The movie itself will look a little dated to younger viewers. I can't imagine anyone under the age of 40 making any connection to the way things were then. But, if you're a grandparent, you can watch it with the kids, and tell them that, ""yes, that really is a view of life then"".

The acting is superb! You will finish the film thinking you know the characters intimately. It's a very human movie, and if you can walk away without whistling the theme song, as done by John Wayne, I'll be surprised.

There are  many classic movies out there. This is a very good one. I've waited a long time for it to be available. It was worth the wait. Enjoy!",1126915200,,945,4.114130434782608

top of the list.  This film came out within a year or so of another fine John Wayne movie: Island In The Sky.  In fact if one pays close attention, you'll find many of the same supporting cast members in both of these films.

The High and The Mighty does an excellent job of presenting how people how are at different stages of life. Total strangers to one another come together and find themselves facing the very real possibility of their own mortality.  Begin examining their lives, and the importance of life itself attempting to determine whats truly important and whats superficial.

Then we have the flight crew for whom flying had become a matter of ho-hum just another flight.  Now find themselves having to call not only on every bit of training and experience they have. But coming to the realization that they in fact might not be in

control of their own fate and that of everyone onboard.  That the only things which might save them are cool heads and divine intervention.  Will keep you on the edge of your seat, both in the cabin and in the cockpit.

This innovative idea goes blithely out to world to attract notice and admiration. But as familiarity breeds comtempt, the exceptional idea repeated too often becomes dry and hackneyed, and few of us remember its youth and winsome freshness.  Thus with The High and the Mighty. Whereas my husband remembered it as a riveting thriller, as he watches it now, he comments only on the stereotyped characters and the predictable course of the plot. Newly-weds incredible in their naivete, spoiled actors secure in their egos, aging glamour girls unaware of the value of their hard-won experience inhabit this film.

This is not an action film or a Western. It is a psychological thriller and focuses on the characters, and Wayne gives a magnificent performance as do all the others in the cast. This movie is a classic and I highly recommend it for fans of Wayne, the disaster genre, or of ensemble films of high caliber. If you've never seen this film before, you'll be on the edge of your seat. If you have seen it before, it holds up very well to repeated viewing as the cast pulls you in and makes you care about these people on a crippled plane over the Pacific who are trying desperately to stay in the air rather than ditch in the stormy sea, which would be an almost certain death sentence.

The screenplay piles on so many remarkably misguided cliches (which must have been hoary even then) you begin to think that somebody somewhere (probably Wellman) must have had his tongue planted firmly in his cheek.

The Ultra-Wide Cinemascope transfer is definitely a credit to those people who labor insanely to preserve America's film heritage, especially after the collapse of the studio system. ""The High and the Mighty"" is soap opera with suspense, just like every other disaster film, though it was the first. My interest was held, solidly, and the course of events entertained me. The ensemble cast was uniformly fine, with Oscar nods going to Claire Trevor & Jan Sterling, though I thought Paul Fix was deserving as well. Ralph Dawson's brilliant editing was also nominated. Keeping all this stuff coherent is the sure and confident hand of veteran William A. Wellman, juggling scenes and events that might otherwise come off as silly and incongruous.

The story is of an airliner on passage from Hawaii to California when it has engine problems. It is doubtful whether she will make it to land. John Wayne plays the co-pilot running from a terrible accident in the past and Robert Stack plays the pilot. The film is not about them, however, or even about their efforts to save their passengers. Instead, it is about the different ways in which people react to the stresses of the situation. It is a series of short vignettes. They are very well done and the movie is inspiring in a way that the AIRPORT franchise rarely was able to achieve.

It was something special for the two of us because we both loved flying. (I eventually became a pilot.)

Tonight I watched the DVD version (who knew it was filmed in color?)and saw my favorite movie for the first time in decades. I have read the novel many times in the intervening years and found it an excellent surrogate for the film because they are identical in spirit and almost identical in dialog. All the extra features that come with the DVD are worthwhile but, being fairly well versed in the aeronautical background, I found the most value in my distillation of all that Leonard Maltin says in his introduction: Take yourself back in time to when a movie depended more on story and characterization than special effects and a loud soundtrack. If you can do that, just a bit, you will eat this one up!

Then, there is the music. Everyone who saw this film back in the day remembers the fine themes and orchestration but I've never heard it like this. This must be how it sounded in the theaters when this was a first run movie. Put aside an evening to really enjoy this fine entertainment. Wallow in this very ""movie"" movie and the background features when you aren't pressed for time because it's pretty long. At long last, when you look through the windshield of that beleaguered DC-4 and see the runway lights at SFO appear through the fog and hear the music rise to meet the fast-descending aircraft, you'll feel the thrill of redemption I  felt as a kid. Then, just wait--there's a whole new musical theme  as the passengers deplane! I'm going to watch it again tomorrow night after work. I can almost forgive those who made us wait so long to see The High and the Mighty again.

  Oh, this is a John Wayne movie, too, isn't it? I never cared much for him (especially politically) but he's excellent in this. He portrays a character of about my age (though he was younger at the time) who I find admirable.

By no means am I an authority but I have a huge assortment of classic movies on DVD and VHS.  This film ranks among the best films Hollywood ever made and to use that time worn cliche', ""they simply do not make them like this anymore"".  What stands out here is that a film that has not been seen in nearly 50 years has been beautifully remastered thanks to the art of film preservation.  The colors are vibrant, the cinematography is spectactular, the acting is superb by everyone, and the screenplay is right on the money. Topping it off is the unforgettable musical score which won an Oscar for Dimitri Tiomkin.  The one star reviewer obviously only saw the picture once and could not appreciate it with one viewing!

The movie is not boring in the least.  The characters are established from the beginning and we see their lives through flashbacks but the flashbacks are interspersed perfectly with the present.  We could not understand the characters were it not for the flashbacks.  And the flashbacks are very few, anyhow.

The main focus of the story is ""survival"" in the midst of calamity in air travel during the fifties.  Full of suspense and real characterizations, the film holds up perfectly today and John Wayne holds the picture together.  Watch the scene where he talks to the passengers to inform them of their plight.  Also watch the dandy sequence and exchange between him and Robert Stack where Stack wants to ditch into the ocean and John Wayne smacks him!  Pure movie magic!!  And the whistling of the unforgettable song......ahhh.....folks, please enjoy this one!!  I am so grateful that it has been restored perfectly.  And there is also another disc full of dandy extras including:  John Wayne's film production company ""BatJac"" which produced the film and many others with actors testifying to Wayne's professionalism and kindness;  interviews with Karen Sharpe (the young married newlywed in the film), Doe Avedon (the Stewardess), the guy who played officer Hobie (I forgot what his name was) and Gonzales, Gonzales, the mexican dispacher.  There is a wonderful commentary too.  Also included is a William Wellman tribute, footage from the movie premiere in Hollywood, original theatrical and television trailers and a great documentary entitled ""Flying in the fifties"" with interviews from several Pilots and a Stewardess (as they used to be called then) about how things were back then at the beginning of aviation travel.  This DVD is well worth the price and a bargain at Amazon at only $13.49.  You can also get it at Walmart for $19.99.  Truly a film to add to your collection and one which you will watch over and over again!  All star power at its finest!!",1123372800,11,2795,4.8071278825995805

There is absolutely no action -- it's a bunch of people sitting on an airplane reflecting on their lives punctuated with some pathetic flashbacks.  It's interminably long, too.

2301292,5,B0009ML2KQ,"Cable tv will chop THATM to pieces and play it to death, with massive damage from commercials and banners. For many Baby Boomers this chestnut is a kind of 23rd Psalm, leaving everyone under 50 seriously puzzled: there's only one explosion (mostly off camera), no car chases, no bodies flying thru fake-glass windows in slo-mo, and most scenes actually last longer than 5 seconds.  Logical left-brainers will scoff, right-brainers will drool, and A.D.D. victims will go bananas during Wellman's skillfully orchestrated, uncut scenes. Yet 50+ years sees this old hit chugging along -- like Dan Roman it limps a bit but comes through in grand style. Director Wellman and a Warner cast and crew are still on course; small touches, much detail, great camera work, old-pro acting and pure schmaltz keep its ripe corn aloft without the need for preposterous aerial acrobatics or singing nuns in Max Factor Lite with carry-on guitars. Yes, there are goofs: an airline clerk claims the plane is overloaded, but it's not half booked. A fuselage exit door opens in the wrong direction. The soundtrack seems frantic at times, and today's airline screw-ups are so common that the '54 passengers seem unduly grim at being inconvenienced - though the actual risks are too, too real. Yessir, near the end there's a politically incorrect crucifix (shown twice).  Some shots of the plane reveal a non-computer-generated model (a 1954 audience might ask, ""What's a computer""?). You watch as if from a time capsule, often skeptically: Doe Avedon is an impossibly classy stewardess, Robert Stack is more berserk than simply fearful, nearly everyone on board is at a suicidal crossroad, and today many 50's sensibilities seem suspect or merely baffling (but dig Paul Kelly's crisp anti-proliferation rant, anticipating the 60's, and remember during the purposely sappy exchange between newlyweds that the word ""pregnant"" was verboten in 1954). Yet THATM, though formulaic then, achieves High Camp at each playing, with a human spirit far more involving than its goofy, even more generic imitators. You either hate it (born after 1950) or you're fascinated.  The DVD print is good, often supurb. The sometimes pale, reprocessed WarnerColor (Ansco/Eastman) looks great now.  Tiomkin's great Oscar winning score is intact, if at times a bit harshly ""digitized"" -- play it with Dobly 5.1, and you're in for a treat. The DVD extras make a great package, even if the runtime commentary sorely needs editing.  6 Oscar nominations.  Warning: Visually THATM really suffers on tv, needs a big screen -- if your player lets you blow up the image a bit, it's a vast improvement. Myth: when slapped, Robert Stack never says ""Thanks. I needed that"" (watch the movie for the actual line). 50 years ago, viewers expected more for their time and money than a comic book of special effects; in this case, there's a great collection of talent and narrative, and Wayne and Wellman keep it fueled and magically integrated. Get a load of the well-played scene between Wayne and Campbell during the ditching prep -- along with many other memorable scenes not likely to appear in today's megabuck 'FX-only' frenzies. And those last few seconds with JW and Regis Toomey are still a classic grabber. Get it!",1122681600,15,3260,5.072761194029851
2301293,4,B0009ML2KQ,"Fans of John Wayne have waited nearly 25 years for the release of ""The High And The Mighty"", a movie starring Duke Wayne that was originally released in theatres in 1954. It was last viewed on TV in 1981-1982, after which the rights to the movie were tied up by the Wayne family. The movie then languished in the Wayne film vault, suffered major water damage, and one reel of the three-reel movie was lost for sometime(!). Fortunately, the missing reel was found, the water damage meticulously restored to its Technicolor brilliance, and now it has finally been released on DVD in August of 2005. The question is: Is this movie as good as everyone remembers, and was it worth the wait?

The answer to the above questions is a resounding ""Yes""! ""The High and The Mighty"" is as good as fans remembered; I don't put it in Wayne's top-10, but it is not too far behind (therefore 4 of 5 stars). Wayne is handsome and engaging as the co-pilot of a damaged plane flying over the Pacific Ocean from Hawaii to San Francisco. Wayne certainly does not dominate the film, as the lives and backgrounds of many other characters on the plane are slowly brought to life. I say ""slowly"" because the film takes about 75 minutes to set all the characters in place before the mid-air crisis develops. The film then becomes a character study of how all the passengers and crew deal with the liklihood of crashing into the drink. The diversity of characters and their emotional reactions to the crisis keeps one's interest throughout the more than 2-hour long film.

This was the first real ""disaster"" film, and it set the stage for many others in this genre (Airport, Airport 1975, and the immensely funny spoof Airplane).

The DVD comes with a companion disk that is about 75 minutes long and contains interesting background information about the film's history, how it was restored, etc. It is interesting and entertaining, but the real star here is of course the movie itself.

I recommend buying it. It makes great family entertainment and even younger kids will like it. The special effects are amazingly simple and primitive compared to today's technology, but one buys the movie for John Wayne's performance, and for this reason it is more than worth the $14.95 asking price. I guarantee that you will be literally whistling a different tune after watching this movie, as Wayne ""lip-synchs"" a catchy whistle tune throughout the movie that sticks with you.

The movie is pure fun drama and I recommend it without any reservations. You'll have a good time watching ""The High and the Mighty"", and by the way, thanks for waiting for it!

2301294,5,B0009ML2KQ,"Like so many stars of the late 40's and 50's, the movie was built so as to be carried by A HOLLYWOOD STAR. Certainly Bogart. You had a period shortly before that with older leading men, John Garfield and Paul Muni; Fred MacMurray as a straight guy. Jimmy Stewart and Tyrone Power. Robert Taylor in the Medieval dramas. And of course, John Wayne, the Duke. Truly a man larger than life. (My favorite was ""The Searchers"" with a skinny Natalie Wood, but High and Mighty is an awfully close second.)

The High and the Mighty was a fantastic movie however the Ernie Gann's novel gave it more beef. Robert Stack was a Korean War ace and hero but more burned out than his copilot by the rigors of the war. Wayne of course had lost his family in a crash years earlier and there was a generational tension between Wayne, who had cut his teeth (if I remember correctly) in the Eddie Rickenbacker ""Hat-in-the-Ring"" squadron at the close of World War I. To a large extent, he's given the job as copilot out of kindness because he is the old pelican, and time and luck has passed him by. Hence his own reluctance to talk the skipper, Stack, out of ditching in an angry sea when the stuff has hit the fan.

The discovery of 'who they REALLY are' by the passengers, the arrogant becoming cowards, the shallow becoming Homeric, is really a brilliant subplot against the canvas of the doomed airliner.

The scene that stayed in my mind for 40 years plus is the scene where the coffee service is being prepared and the Flight Attendant, kneeling down before the steel kitchen cabinet,  looks up to see the coffee splatter from an unseen, unheard shimmy. Brrrr.

Great movie for everything. And the theme from the High and The Mighty from Dimitri Tiomkin - I don't know what else he did but that theme stayed with me for 40 years plus too. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury",1122076800,14,1847,4.4851190476190474
2301295,4,B0009ML2KQ,"""The High and the Mighty"", the granddaddy of air disaster movies, often falls into almost campy melodrama, but under the direction of the legendary 'Wild Bill' Wellman, and punctuated by one of Dimitri Tiomkin's most bombastic yet exciting scores (earning him an Oscar), the film maintains such a level of intensity that it remains constantly entertaining. With John Wayne heading an ensemble cast (including several co-stars from the past, as well as personal friends), it is certainly an essential for any 'Duke' film library.

Produced by Wayne-Fellows Productions, and 'owned', eventually, by the Wayne family's Batjac Productions (along with ""Hondo"", ""McLintock!"", and ""Island in the Sky""), the film was a BIG hit, when released, and offered one of Wayne's better performances, then gained even greater stature as it was unseen for a generation. I've always held the belief that the family planned to release the entire quartet of films in 2007, to mark the centennial of Duke's birth, but two events changed the plan; first, an unauthorized, 'remixed' VHS version of ""McLintock!"" was released, with rumors that a version of ""Hondo"" was also in the works, forcing Michael Wayne, then President of Batjac, to release authorized VHS versions of the two films, rather than have the market glutted with bad copies; second, with Michael's death, in 2003, the Wayne family rethought the master plan, deciding to release the entire collection on DVD earlier. For whatever reason, seeing ""The High and the Mighty"" again is a cause to celebrate!

Based on Ernest K. Gann's bestseller (which would inspire Arthur Hailey's later novel, ""Airport""), the story centers around a routine commercial flight between Honolulu and San Francisco, which becomes a life-and-death drama when one engine explodes, just beyond the 'Point of No Return'. With limited fuel, in deteriorating weather, the crisis brings out the best and worst in both passengers and crew.

Wayne as the co-pilot, is quite good, playing a character older than he actually was (the role had been written for Spencer Tracy, who pulled out, just prior to filming); Robert Stack almost foreshadows his character in ""Airplane!"" as the no-nonsense pilot who goes ballistic when stressed. For cockpit 'overacting', however, the award has to go to Wally Brown, as the navigator, with his bugged-out eyes, visions of his shrewish wife, and WILDLY unruly hair...

While the passengers are all stereotypes, several actors are quite good in their roles, with standout performances by Claire Trevor and Jan Sterling (both Oscar-nominated), Robert Newton, Paul Kelly, and Paul Fix. While Phil Harris attempts to inject humor into his role, it only works sporadically (and Ann Doran, as his wife, plays 'hysterical' so convincingly that you want to STRANGLE her!) Laraine Day, third-billed (and, with Trevor, a previous Wayne leading lady), is remarkably unlikable as a rich wife with a 'bought' husband (John Howard); Sidney Blackmer plays the 'mandatory' unbalanced type; and veteran character actor John Qualen adds another 'ethnic' portrayal to his long list, as a Latin family man (with a Norweigan accent!) A bit of trivia: The young boy onboard was portrayed by director Wellman's son!

Almost as fascinating as the story is seeing how much has changed, since the film was released; the plane's 'tail' is controlled by pulleys and wires in a rear compartment; the sole flight attendant is a ""stewardess""; and everyone smokes (especially in the cockpit). On a more somber note, there is NO security, and one passenger boards easily, carrying a gun. It is, sadly, a wiser world, today...

While no one would ever accuse ""The High and the Mighty"" of being a film classic, it's role in creating the 'airplane disaster' genre can't be denied, and it continues to be a vastly enjoyable John Wayne feature.

So this is not a great movie or a great Wayne movie, but it is interesting as a picture that set the form for later disaster movies.  As is true with those later movies, this one over did some of the dramatics.

What it comes down to, though, is John Wayne taking control only when he was most needed.  It was a quick scene, but as dramatic as the cavalry charging in one of his old westerns.  The viewer can watch and say ""YES!""

I probably didn't agree with a quarter of Wayne's politics except for his genuine love of this country, but I watch actors for their work, not their politics.

Now that it's out of the way, you can expect similar sentiments to follow!

This movie is rare, as it is definately one well worth waiting for! The attention to detail regarding the story is remarkable - it really draws the viewer into what really happens when a run-of-the-mill flight from Honolulu to San Francisco goes wrong. From the mecanical drama of the airplane, to the human drama of the individual passengers and crew, the viewer feels like they are right there, living out the experience with the passenger, the crew, and of course with John Wayne and Robert Stack at the controls.

Now that the movie is coming out again, I hope that a new generation of movie afficianado comes to treasure this masterpiece. A film afficianado who is looking for a real nail-biter drama without a icky sugar-coated treatment that so many of these type of movies now have, this is your movie!

Don't hesitate, buy it today. You won't regret it!",1116460800,24,1150,4.595121951219512

The wait is over...  Aug. 2, 2005

FYI - You can go to the Paramount site, and see all the DVD details and extras - quite a list. You will have to do a search for the title on the Home Entertainment page. It is not on the upcoming releases page yet.

For everyone reading this under the age of 45, you have to remember. A lot of people my age watched this movie a bunch of times on TV growing up in the 50s and 60s. It was a great story at that time, with lots of realistic scenes that were not the norm then. Ernest Gann, the writer and technical consultant, was an airline pilot. The director, William Wellman, flew with the Lafayette Escadrille during WW I. These guys made ""real"" movies during the fifties, that inspired guys like me to grow up and be a part of aviation into the new century.  William Wellman's movies, especially Public Enemy, the Ox-Bow incident, and Battleground, brought something to Hollywood unheard of at the  time of each movie - realism. A bunch of us have read all of Ernest Gann's (and Robert Serling's) aviation books. The High and the Mighty, and Fate is the Hunter are the best of the best of that time. The High and the Mighty managed to wrap an incredibly authentic aviation story around a pretty good ""Hollywood"" dramatic potboiler about a bunch of people re-evaluating their soon to be short lives... It has been copied hundreds of times since. If you are looking for today's version of realism - ""American Idol"" or ""Blind Date"", go back to your TV and tune them in. You will not be happy with any 50s movie, much less this one. If you liked ""Casablanca"" in black and white, or you have an incurable fondness for airplane flicks over the years like ""Twelve O'Clock High"" or ""The Battle of Britain"", both recently released on DVD, you will like ""The High and the Mighty"". In fact, you will love it. John Wayne limping off towards the darkness of the airport arrival gate, whistling the title song, is one of those things indelibly etched in my mind.

I was always an aviation nut and would ride my bike to Midway Airport in Chicago with my little sister on the handlebars and have been an Air Traffic Controller for 34 years now. This movie was the perfect melding of aviation and action. When I moved to Hawaii in 1980, I met a new neighbor, Captain William (Bill) Benge, who was the actual pilot of the aircraft in the movie. He used to tell tales of the final approach into San Francisco. They did several takes with the director Wellman constantly yelling: ""Lower Bill, Lower"" til Bill finally wiped out several approach lights with the landing gear and the tower controllers radioed"" That's it, Park it! You're through for the night!""  Bill was impressed with the cast and what real gentlemen and ladies they were. The Captain passed away this January but his legacy in this film lives on.

2301380,5,B0009ML2KQ,"I think this is John Wayne's best. With thousands of hours in his log book, he saves the day (night) by bringing Stack to his senses and pushes the plane and fuel to the limits. He is considered ""The Ancient Pelican"" by his boss, but he knows that he is the one who brings in this four engine piston/prop airliner.  The film details the personal stories of all the passengers aboard in this commercial flight from Hawaii to California.  It's amazing to see how far we have come in air travel today. The great music score by Dimitri Tiomkin is beautiful.  Hearing John Wayne whistling this tune in the movie is unforgettable.  Being an old pilot, the technical details in this film are superb!
John Wayne produced and starred in this one of the first airplane disaster films made.
Spencer Tracy was slated to take this role but never did. This film was never enhanced. Academy award winning music and a very well acted and enjoyable film that is a real find for John Wayne movie collectors!  I finally found a copy after many years of searching, although poor video quality, it still is a great film to watch over and over.

2301381,5,B0009ML2KQ,"A most unusual role for ""The Duke.""  Dan Roman is flawed; he once has failed, at least in the world's view.  This may not be actually true.  You don't know.  Previous to his ""failure,"" however, he participated in the fearsomely fabled ""low-level"" bombing raid on the Polesti oil refineries in 1943.  Dan Roman ""accepts"" the world's view of him and ""makes-do,"" perhaps because he has a personal rather than an institutional value system.  Eventually, he, the ""failure,"" is forced by circumstances to preserve an airliner and thereby the lives of a number of people.  And thereafter, he simply walks away.  Into the ""fog of night.""  ""The High and The Mighty"" is a highly interesting character study.  With age, one discovers that very few people indeed are ""without flaw.""  This doesn't mean they're unworthy.  In his cinematic creation of Co-Pilot Dan Roman, Mr. John Wayne projected this timeless theme to a remarkable degree.  And it's a lesson ""The Rambo Generation"" could well learn!

I wanted nothing more in life than to become an airline pilot after seeing that movie.  The theme song, which has continued to play in my head over the ensuing years, always reminds me of that boyhood dream.  Unfortunately my eyesight kept me from pursuing that dream and I've always regretted it.  Wayne was the perfect hero and the final scenes of the movie have styaed with me ever since.  Academy award theme song playing in the background, the station manager of SFO calling John Wayne's character an ""old pelican"" after he is insturmental in bringing the airliner home after six hours of terror over the Pacific, and John just walks off into the night in his beat up flight jacket saying nothing.
Maybe because I lived near the San Francisco airport and had flown out of there that summer on United to Seattle in an old DC4 and then on to Fairbanks, Alaska on Pan Am to visit my cousin made it even more meaningful.  Whatever the reason, I can still remember the great cast and scenes in the back of the plane where everyone was terrified.  Its the only movie that has affected me in such a manner.

  NOT ""unavailable"" as stated above, but being DVD issued in August 2005.  This is a legendary movie of the 1950s, long regarded as one of John Wayne's all time greatest films.

Gann, it featured a first-rate ensemble cast and a riveting storyline, as well as a theme song that became almost a musical icon of the period. But somewhere along the way this wonderful film got ""kidnapped"" into ""movie limbo"" and has drifted there ever since, mired in all manner of obtuse legalities and , ultimately, a seeming intention on the part of the late Michael Wayne to ""hold it back"" from general release to the public ""until the time is right"".

His character of Dan the co-pilot was excellent. Even than I could see he was the star. That was my first John Wayne movie. I was hooked. I lived in a large city, and I had never taken a flight anywhere. I became cosumed by airplanes. The different people, and how they were all connected to John's character.
The most dramatic parts were, just as they past the point of no return, and the problems that ensuded. I was on the end of my seat for the rest of the movie. One part was very significant to me. When John smacks Robert Stack around to shake him up, "" Fly the airplane"" then he was ok. At the end after they have gone through the fire, engines falling off, and all their problems, they finally land. They are meet by the station manager. He looks at the aircraft, looks at John Wayne, and says, ""You old pelican"" John just walks away. The End. It took me many years to understand what the meaning was. The pelican is the best flying bird in the bird world. The theme music won an academy award.
I was so moved I knew I wanted to be a pilot. I presued it throughout my life. The US Air Force, and Pan American Airways. I was very lucky to have acheived my dream. I am retired from flying now. It would give me gerat pleasure to see this movie with my childern.

2301428,5,B0009ML2KQ,"John Wayne and his supporting staff made this movie an aviation classic when compared to todays flying films.  When first viewed with my older brother the movie seemed so believeable. It had everything to make the movie interesting and memorable, the young and happy co-pilot, the near retirement aged flight engineer with visions of expected disaster, pretty stewardess and a host of normal looking passengers but each with a story of their own.  Of course, it had the captain who was the captain in the truest sense of leadership.  It followed a story line that had been traveled countless times.  However, in 1954 it traveled that same course but this time from the cockpit of a DC-6. This movie classic is different.  Not everyone is lifted from the page of a beauty magazine.  The actors are not required to fly the plane in a thunderstorm and at the same time transfer rescue
personnel through the broken windscreen of the plane at 250 mph.  They allow us to watch as a truely believeable situation unfolds and real people react and win in the end. If I am lucky enough to again view this movie classic, I'm sure my mind will at the same time wander back to the first time I stepped into the cockpit of a 1950's something airliner.  The smell of neopreme hoses used under the cockpit instrument panel is the same smell I would come to enjoy as a young adult when learning to fly.  The thrill of ""feeling the airplane in your hands"" is a real feeling.  But when the characters of that movie felt it, they went from a normal flight to the airplane telling them of trouble to come.  The movie is believeable because the characters did a very good job of not carrying the audience to feats of todays flying films.  This movie will not leave you tired of countless scenes impossible to accomplish but not impossible for Hollywood to top every year. While you know how it will end you really aren't sure until the very end. Hollywood needs to go back to movie school and watch this movie as much as us.",1011830400,37,2002,4.530555555555556

This is the original airplane disaster movie, which many people have tried to copy, but have not been able to get together anything like the cast and the story in this one.
Not having seen the film since it's release to the theaters, I'm sure the effects will be archaic - all the more for anyone not having seen it to view an absolutely absorbing movie about seemingly real people thinking they are about to die.

The film is a terrific ride from start to finish, with an excellent cast and a magnificent score by Dimitri Tiomkin. Alas, I believe that is the reason why we haven't seen this great film in years. The score, and the title song were both nominated for Oscars. The score won the Oscar....the song didn't. (""Three Coins in the Fountain"" won that year.) Some time afterwards, another composer accused Dimitri Tiomkin of plagarising his own work.....I can't remember who this was i'm afraid. The outcome being that Warners had to withdraw the film from circulation until the matter was sorted out. As we've never seen the film since, one can only assume that it's an ongoing situation, although I would imagine that who ever brought the complaint is long gone now (as is Tiomkin). They can show the FILM folks....but NOT with it's beautiful score, and, as anyone who has ever seen the film will tell you, the score is one of the Stars of the film.

It was so exciting and the theme music and sound track were so haunting and beautiful---it brought chills to me then and even recently, when I saw a retrospective on the films of William Wellman.
Approximately three years ago, I asked Turner Classic movie channel if they would show this movie and their reply was that they were in negotiation with the Wayne Estate on that very subject.  They projected that it would be shown in August of that year---well something must have happened, because it was never shown.  TCM never responded to my inquiries, but I read somewhere where Michael Wayne's house suffered flood damage and the film negative of the High and The Mighty suffered water damage.

I don't know, but I do know he has been waiting a LONG time for this wonderful movie to be released. I would like to be able to give it as a gift to him, and have my own copy as well.

The Duke was wonderful to us kids and  it was a real thrill to work with him because he was so gentle.  I will  never forget it as long as I live.  The story is an in-depth study of  different passengers' reactions to facing their own mortality and the toll  the millions of air miles places on the pilots.  The story is dated by  today's standards, but the emotions, fears, and reactions are the same in  the most modern of today's jetliners.

I have never understood  why it was not released on video. (I last saw it in 1973 on local TV in  Chicago.)
When The Duke died, I accurately predicted that the networks  would select the closing scenes of The High and The Mighty as his  epitaph--not She Wore A Yellow Ribbon, not Fort Appache, not Stagecoach,  not even True Grit.  And I was right--he went out with a loving ""So  long, you ancient pelican.""

2301454,5,B0009ML2KQ,"Tied up for years in the John Wayne estate has been the re-release of this 1954 movie, ""The High and the Mighty"". (which won the Academy Award for Best Song that year...look for a plaque at Mann's Chinese Theatre  in Hollywood when you visit there).
As a child growing up in L.A. in the  50's and 60's, I remember the then RKO TV station Channel 9 would show this  movie relentlessly for years on end.  Then it all stopped.  The movie  vanished.  And now it is being held hostage for some legal reason.
It  is a movie filled with surplatives though  younger viewers might find the  lack of hyberbolic special effects, sexual gymnastics,  de riguer corporate  disembowlment themes, blah blah....too unsurvivable for a start-to-finish  viewing. It is a vintage 50's type movie...at its best.
This is John  Wayne's best movie, in my opinion. He is excellent...taking him out of the  cowboy theme he ultimately became cemented into.  I will always remember  John Wayne in my mind as he was in this movie...especially the very last  scene which alone is worth the price of admission.  Fittingly, the Orange  County Airport is named after John Wayne, who had a career early on of  appearing in films with aviation themes.
Ernest K. Gann, who penned the  story, was an American Airlines pilot who churned out aviation novel, one  after another. His equally famous novel that was made into an excellent  movie, was ""Fate is the Hunter"". Both of these movies deal with  an aircraft incident/accident.  ""The High and the Mighty""  concentrates on the human dynamics of a flight crew and their maintenance  base trying to cope with a mechanical problem en route over the longest  single over-the-ocean route in the world: Honolulu to San Francisco.  It is  as dramatic and technically accurate as you could possibly get.  In fact,  ""The High and the Mighty"" had all the elements of the recent Jan.  31, 2000 Alaska Airlines crash northwest of Los Angeles.
""Fate is  the Hunter"" meticulously examines the post accident phase of aircraft  crash investigation.  It is almost like a Hitchock movie in terms of  suspense.  I don't think this movie is available either and that is a shame  since there is so much junk out there that is. Glenn Ford is the star of  this movie.
The exciting conclusion of ""The High and the  Mighty"" stays with you forever...much like the ending of the movie  ""The Spirit of St. Louis"" which starred James Stewart (also a  great movie and is available).
""The High and the Mighty"" is a  true aviator's movie...it has the feel and touch of a veteran pilot at the  yoke, Ernest K. Gann.  All of us down on the ground here can only hope and  pray that the powers to be let this great, great American film out of the  hanger and let her fly again....soon.",955756800,550,2762,4.689727463312369
