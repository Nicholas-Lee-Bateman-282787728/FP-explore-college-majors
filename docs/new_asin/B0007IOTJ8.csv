2213903,5,B0007IOTJ8,"This roughly four-hour documentary, ""Slavery and the Making of America,"" is a concise look at the nearly two and a half centuries of slavery from the first arrival of black indentured servants at the Jamestown Colony in 1619 through the end of the Civil War in 1865. In fact, this documentary also covers the rise of black political power in the South after the war and the impact of the Ku Klux Klan following the end of Reconstruction.

This four-part PBS series covers all the bases and manages to be both scholarly and enthralling at the same time. Here's what makes this documentary work so well:

[] Using Morgan Freeman as the narrator was a stroke of genius. His voice grabs the viewers' attention and doesn't let go. (Hey, he manages to keep my high school sophomores riveted!)

[] In addition to Freeman as the narrator, the makers of this documentary utilize numerous historians and scholars to tell the story providing not only facts, but their own perspectives. This variety of sources makes for compelling listening.

[] Throughout all four discs, personal slave experiences are told: John Punch, Mum Bett, Harriet Jacobs, Louis Hughes, Solomon Northup, Robert Smalls. Individual stories, but with shared experiences.

I use this in its entirety every year (along with reading Julius Lester's ""To Be a Slave"") to provide the necessary background before reading ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn."" Slavery all too often is trivialized in textbooks, and this documentary goes a long way toward providing students with a basic understanding of the slave experience. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1330646400,11,1598,5.10727969348659
2213904,4,B0007IOTJ8,"As an African-American I am interested in movies about Black history, Black culture, and life during slavery and historical black events.
As a result I purchased about a dozen DVDs on various subject matter which I am just now getting around to viewing.
This DVD gave me more insight into the slavery aspect during the period before we became a nation.
Each DVD was approx. 55 minutes long I would have liked to have had more because of the price, never less this is fine addition to my collection and I recommend it to others for its educational value.",1323561600,11,553,4.595959595959596
2213905,5,B0007IOTJ8,"The information provided in the cds was thorough, diverse, and accurate.  It gives the viewer the impression that the series was produced with the care that only serious lovers of pure history can provide. I also appreciated that the historians featured on the various cds were not solely of African American lineage.  There were well-rounded views and opinions expressed.",1259712000,20,372,5.288135593220339
2213906,5,B0007IOTJ8,"I have watched and re-watched this series on PBS, and with each episode I always go away having learned something. The researchers and writers were thorough, the re-enactments are well-played*, and the tempo of each segment is appropriate. Morgan Freeman is the perfect choice for a narrator (even better than Whoopie Goldberg in Unchained Memories); he speaks like a wise, maturing uncle versed in the intricacies of a long, unpleasant family history.

My favorite segments are those on David Walker's call to resistance; a certain Miss Freeman, who successfully sued for her freedom; and Col. Tye's band of 18th century guerilla warriors.

*Such re-enactments, when accurately presented, are essential to helping viewers understand the realities of the era, as there are so few photographs and no moving pictures in existence from this lengthy period in American history. (As the narrator says, ""America was a slave-holding society longer than it has been a 'free' society."")",1200528000,44,977,5.337662337662338
2213907,5,B0007IOTJ8,"I watched this over and over so that I could justify using it as a teaching tool to college and HS students. I grew tired of presentations on slavery ignoring or missing America's economic gain. Therefore, I was most impressed by this PBS series mentioning it. Yes, its inconvenient to say that the Industrial Revolution would not have happened without the free labor of slaves. (oh, yes, some African/Blacks did get 40 acres and a mule but, it was taken away by a former confederate soldier who later became a government official...). Henry Ford, J.P. Morgan, or even Bill Gates, hang on the coattails of the ""planters"" who made big money directly from African slave labor. The ""planters"" created the first IMAGES of superiority because they had more money, more control/power over many, and a ""position."" Believe me, slavery was building America's economic FUTURE not just imposing a sense of superiority. In a morbid sort of way slavery worked out pretty good for the American economy we live in today! Trust me when I say this, it means something to have an image of finacial power, even if you are poor, its the indelible IMAGE of having money, position, and power, that is most effective. A professor told me once that America is ""ahistorical"" I like that word. America concedes that slavery existed at one time and is over(whew!)but, the idea that some have benefitted financially, directly and indirectly from American slavery, might be an inconvenient truth. See ""Centrix Financial...apologizes...slavery..."" Something like that.",1169596800,57,1538,5.08300395256917
2213908,5,B0007IOTJ8,"I have kept my eyes on this for a entire year. I noticed one thing, I wasn't willing to pay 80.00 for this it was going to be used several times with adults to share with children, so I thought I would wait. Sometime in August it was down to $54.00 right here on amazon and at that time I was just about to get it. Now that it's martin luther king day and going to be black history month, the price will be HIGHER until about april and then your see a dramatic change. Keep your eyes open, people will onyl tell you what they want you to know. PBS has been asking for money for past 20 years that I can remember. One or two things should have happended. Either they got richer or they got poorer. Which one do you think happened?

This is a excellent tool to teach children and adults, please note that the high price has nothing to do with PBS, it's the system designed to make you think otherwise.

Please wait until this product goes down, cause it will.",1168646400,14,957,4.139784946236559
2213909,5,B0007IOTJ8,"When you pay the high price for a PBS production, you are helping PBS to pay for their cause. You are not being ripped off. This is a worthy reason why the cost is higher per minute of programming than other productions. The reviewer below apparently does not take this into account. Today DVD's cost $1 each or less in cost for the actual manufacturing of the disc. When a DVD is made and sold, the retail price pays for many things such as actors, production, and profit. If you look into how PBS spends their money, you will clearly note, it is not a profit making venture. This is an excellent series, worthy of the price. Yes, you can get a good deal here, lower than the retail price, from a Marketplace seller... or get yourself an even better deal (at a higher price) direct from the PBS web site, by supporting their cause... and the many more public productions to come. PBS... Possible Through Support From Viewers LIKE YOU.",1116806400,45,935,4.473684210526316
2213910,3,B0007IOTJ8,"When i watched this program on PBS, I knew I would get it immediately.  I am a tutor to young men in the Washington DC area and I saw in this program, a way to emphasize economics and the importance of finance in this country.

Unfortunately, the video costs $80.00!!!!!!!!!!  This has four discs with only 60 minutes of programming on each one.  That's a total of 240 minutes!  No special features or bonus material at all!  So you pay $80 for only the series.

Now to give you something to compare this to, I also purchased ""Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson.""  This program cost less than $20.00 and was on two discs; each having 110 minutes of material.  This series also had several special features and bonuses.

If you look at it from a per minute basis, you have:

Slavery and the making of America: $.33 per minute of material

(no bonus material)

Unforgivable Blackness:  $.09 per minute of material

(bonus material)

So ask yourself why Slavery and the Making of America is so expensive?  I bought it anyway because it's important for my mentees to see this, but if you don't NEED it, I would not suggest buying this DVD until the price comes down.  Just record it next time it comes on.",1112313600,39,1224,4.511415525114155
2213911,5,B0007IOTJ8,It is a heavy series.  It is heart breaking to see all that has happened to people over time who have been subjected to slavery.... that is also including human trafficking of today and still the oppression of the African American and other people.  It breaks your heart to think of people who have been so evil over time to enslave others and oppress them.  Truly worth getting.,1393200000,3,379,4.544117647058823
2213912,5,B0007IOTJ8,"I have many documentaries on slavery. This is the best one I have seen. Much of the set goes deeply into the problems the slaves have to face told by the characters themselves. Morgan Freeman (The Shawshank Redemption, Through The Wormhole) is the perfect narrator for this series. I learned a lot about slavery from this set.",1385942400,3,326,4.7368421052631575
2213913,3,B0007IOTJ8,Narration was fine; however the video footage was lacking in detail in parts of the documentary.  This left me with an unfulfilled expectation.,1383609600,2,143,5.217391304347826
2213914,4,B0007IOTJ8,this was a replacement purchase for me so I have no complaints about the product or the delivery it was what i needed.,1370736000,2,118,4.173913043478261
2213915,5,B0007IOTJ8,This is a great video series and all high schoolers should see it.  It makes me angry that so much fictional history was taught when I was in school.  This causes one to think about the US history of slavery and how it is still practiced today.  People are working longer hours for less pay...etc...etc....to get no where.  I once herad the works 'Voluntary servitude' used to describe life for the average US worker today.  This movie helps you to understand that issue.  Also what is happening today with the illegal mexican population in the US and why they are being imported in huge numbers.,1368057600,3,596,4.628571428571429
2213916,5,B0007IOTJ8,"I watched a number of films on Slavery and this set is by far the best one, the deepest dive and the most far reaching.  It discusses not only how slavery became to be what is now known for, but how it developed from the earliest stages around the globe and grew into the nasty beast it became in america.",1364256000,2,305,4.083333333333333
2213917,4,B0007IOTJ8,"Well produced and historically accurate.
Moving and informative with good commentary and solid information.
A thought provoking and emotional experience.",1363737600,3,153,6.7
2213918,5,B0007IOTJ8,I am trying to teach my children about the African American history other than slavery.  We have contributed much and I want them to know that.  This is the beginning,1361145600,3,166,4.5
2213919,4,B0007IOTJ8,I purchased this set to be incorporated into my family's Sunday Night at the Movies.  Every week starting in February we would watch a different movie so that my kids would know their ancestry.  This one was more a narrative or remake documentary not so much a movie.  We still learned quite a bit but i was not as enthused about this as I might have been if it were a movie.  I would still recommend this to anyone.,1359331200,,416,4.227848101265823
2213920,5,B0007IOTJ8,"I found this set of DVD's superb. It is not only factual and stimulating, it is also quite watchable. I teach a history class to senior citizens and plan on using it in my class. They will not only love it, but also end up much better informed about this central institution in our history.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slavery-and-the-Making-of-America-DVD-Set/dp/B0007IOTJ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slavery and the Making of America DVD Set</a>",1353283200,4,488,6.523076923076923

8047637,3,B0007IOTJ8,"It's not bad. It has great production value and it is certainly engaging. However, the narrative concerning the subject matter is a bit skewed. If one were to take the position offered by the commentators and the documentary series as a whole, one would believe that through sheer grit, the slaves freed themselves.
Don't get me wrong- determination played a significant role in achieving freedom. However, while the first two episodes of the series deals with the history of slavery, the second two episodes serve more as a series of personal narratives from past slaves and the commentary seems to suggest that these strong individuals were the reason for the abolition of slavery. In reality, though it is remarkably unfair, the historical truth is that the abolitionist movement gained steam thanks to those with political power and influence (ie: white abolitionists). Though voices like Frederick Douglas played a role in humanizing those who were previously thought of as ""property"" the documentary's unsubtle stance suggests that character and determination on the part of the slaves pulled them from bondage.
In truth, the abolition of slavery was a drawn-out series of political events that were dominated nearly-exclusively by white abolitionists and the documentary glosses over this fact in favor of offering lengthy praise to slaves who survived and were able to document their stories.
Heck, the Civil War itself was barely covered. Of course, it was not a Civil War documentary, but the discussions concerning the Civil War were not only brief, but dominated by discussions concerning the will of former slaves to fight for the union (again, the position of this documentary can be summarized as: ""The slaves freed themselves."")
The first two episodes were great, but the last two meandered and went way off-course and was bereft of a deeper discussion of the socio-political elements that prompted the demise of the ""peculiar institution.""",1451520000,3,1956,5.252396166134186
8047638,5,B0007IOTJ8,Excellent history on slavery that will surprise you.  You will be glad you did.,1450137600,,79,4.642857142857143
8047639,5,B0007IOTJ8,Saw it on TV but this is a must for anyone's library.,1444953600,,53,3.5
8047640,5,B0007IOTJ8,A depressing piece of American history that I cannot ignore.  I'd heard about this series and was delighted to find it on Amazon.,1435708800,2,129,4.608695652173913
8047641,5,B0007IOTJ8,Every American should see this video.  I think it is required viewing in many high schools and universities.  One understands todays' struggles with race in America after seeing this movie.,1428796800,2,189,5.266666666666667

8047644,3,B0007IOTJ8,"I was hoping for a less pedantic exploration of the topic.  If you want to use it in the classroom, it is a valuable teaching tool.  If you want to identify with the historical characters on any kind of an emotional level, it does not deliver.",1413417600,,243,4.260869565217392
8047645,5,B0007IOTJ8,Amazing DVD box set! I'm an African American history teacher at a high school and these videos address the origins of American Slavery; how it changed from indentured servitude to slavery based on race. Easy to follow and entertaining but appropriate for all ages. Highly recommended!,1398470400,4,284,5.195652173913044
