8028330,5,B00007JZVW,"I really like this review of the 2002 24hrs of Lemans. It covers the practice days, the qualifying, and the race. It also has interviews of the racers, which is what really brings the race to life. This was the year when Pirro/Biela/Kristenson won for the third consecutive year, the only trio to ever do that in the history of Lemans.",1379030400,,335,4.508196721311475
8028331,5,B00007JZVW,"The 24 hours of Le Mans dvd by duke is pretty good, My only compliant is that there are segments that repeat?(not a glitch but made that way) and there is not enough Corvette Coverage! Otherwise Despite some bad quality still good dvd.",1235865600,,235,4.488372093023256
8028332,4,B00007JZVW,"Profiling Audi's return to the top step of the podium for the third consecutive year, this comprehensive review of the 24-hour classic French endurance race is a must-have for any sportscar racing fan. The DVD covers the Le Mans testing weekend, scrutineering, practice/qualifying, and the race itself in great visual and audio detail. It also provides mini-features on Audi's recent dominance in the race with its pace-setting car -- the Audi R8 -- and the DVD also does a good job going over the on-track changes the organizers made to the historic course since the 2001 race.

However, there are some slightly disappointing features that hamper the quality of the DVD. First off, when the DVD starts, it goes straight into testing weekend coverage without going to a menu screen first. This is a small annoyance, especially if you want to jump to a specific chapter. Second, the DVD shows qualifying highlights twice, repeating some of the same information over again.

However, these are small flaws and true fans of Le Mans won't mind the rather tiny inconviences to relive the 2002 race.",1138924800,,1093,4.967213114754099
8028333,5,B00007JZVW,"You'll really enjoy this documentary of the 2002 race, it gives you all the lead up to the event, the sights, the sounds, and a sense of the length of time it takes to compete. For me, this was a special find because I attended the 2002 LeMans race and this was a great addition to my travel photos. This particular race was blessed with great weather, no rain, no high winds, perfect. While the Audi's ran away with it, there was so much to enjoy. The Viper/Corvette battle was fun to watch - the Vettes dominated in the end. The Ferrari was a surprise early on. The French were actually making a movie during the race and had two cars entered just for the film. I have not located the film just yet, but I will buy that too when I can.

I spent the entire night driving from one location to the next to get differnt views of the race (a very nice aspect of this race on mostly public streets) and this film captures great action at many spots. My seat was right at the finish line, so the view of the finish on this film brings it all back for me. Like I said, if you like LeMans style racing, if you have a tolerant family (or your own viewing area) you will enjoy this film a lot...and who knows, it may make you want to travel to LeMans and experience it for yourself.",1103587200,,1273,4.133064516129032
8028334,5,B00007JZVW,"If you're intersted to the speed and sights of lemans, this is the video you want to buy. It has a lot of moments captured before the race including the test days of may and qualifying. Its a great way to see cars such as the great 3 car Audi R8 squad, the lone but beautiful Bentley Speed 8, the very loud Panoz, and the wonderful engine notes of the Judd engine powered Courages and Dome. I think this DVD is something of a historic artifact to be collected as it is the last days running of the most prestigious team lemans has recently seen the factory backed Audis. The sight and sounds are great. This is for every fan who just wanna sit back and watch LeMans at home.",1089417600,,674,4.1923076923076925
