999021,3,6305240035,"A very cool movie with good actors. A young Vince Vaughn with a country accent takes a little time to buy into. I'm a huge VV fan, so it was all good. Seemed like if Joaquin's character would have had a little more honesty with the Sheriff then life would have been a lot easier for him. His tight lipped demeanor just kept snow balling his troubles onto himself. Also, if your not a smoker, you might be after you watch this. I'm pretty sure someone is smoking a cigarette in every scene. Haha!",1489276800,,495,4.276595744680851

999355,5,6305240035,"Saw this years ago and loved it. It's well-written (with unique characters), well shot (interior, often claustrophobic close-up scenes are often intercut with beautiful, empty western landscapes), and very well cast (everyone is practically note perfect).  It's funny as hell, but not in a hilarious LOL way -- in a quirky, black humor way.  It's also twisted, tawdry, and suspenseful.  The soundtrack is really well done too, from the songs chosen to the original musical score.

Joaquin's character is sympathetic, though you want to choke him as he lets things happen and the noose tightens. Janeane Garafalo is fantastic as usual, deadpan in her delivery, sometimes devastatingly so. Vince Vaughn is good as well, playing a sort of hyperreal western ""man on the make"" whose surface hides a dark interior. All the minor players are good too.

Clay Pigeons is a true indie flick, in that it defies categorization and crosses genre boundaries. That's probably why some people see it and don't like it -- I don't think they get the point.  It's kind of a mystery-thriller, but not entirely.  It's funny, but not a full blown comedy.  It's sort of a manhunt, but not really.  It's sort of ""an innocent man accused, while the real killer goes free"" -- but not completely.  It defies expectations. Heck, it defies the standard narrative (and Hollywood) ending requirement, to tie up all loose ends -- one of the things I like about it, though that will not go down well with some viewers.

Back when it came out, some critics compared it to Fargo. I agree that it has some things in common with Fargo, though mostly the humor, and minus the gore. There are certain tonal qualities to Clay Pigeons that make me think of Wristcutters: A Love Story, though W:ALS came out 8 years after Clay Pigeons. I would also compare Clay Pigeons (favorably) to some of the funnier episodes of the X-Files.

Specifically the humor and quirkiness of Clay Pigeons, and the unpredictability of the characterizations, reminded me of X-Files episode S3E04 Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose (the ep about the life insurance salesman who could see the future, but only how people would die) and S5E12 Bad Blood (the episode where Mulder and Scully have to get their stories straight to file a report on a kid that Mulder shot because he thought he was a vampire). (If you have seen the ep Bad Blood, there is also a female FBI officer getting a pizza in a motel room scene that will feel familiar when you see Clay Pigeons.)

Don't get me wrong; this movie doesn't deserve the Nobel prize or any Oscar nominations; no great philosophical problems are solved by this movie. And at about the two thirds mark, it starts to meander in terms of point of view. But it gets back on course, though that course does not follow the usual climax/denouement tendency of narrative/Hollywood films. The subversiveness of the ending (you'll understand after you see it) is actually one of the blackest things about it and one of the things I quite liked.

Clay Pigeons is one of those hidden indie gems.",1416009600,,3058,4.777988614800759

I must admit that I am not a fan of Vince Vaughn to begin with but he seems to me to be especially ill-suited to the part. His character is intended to have a magnetic, compelling personality and although he plays the part well, I found him unconvincing. His good-ole-boy persona is believable but the West, including Texas where I grew up, is literally full of personalities as engaging as his. For the premise to work, the character needed extraordinary charm, not just every day, cowboy appeal. Janeane Garafalo, of whom I am a fan and the basic reason I chose this film in the first place, played her much smaller part well and much of it seemed written for her--lines consistent with her comedic style.",1364601600,,895,4.707006369426751

Vaughn's range as an actor is showcased here. I couldn't take my eyes off
him and couldn't wait for him to be back on-screen. Joaquin Phoenix plays
the small-town rube to perfection. In fact, all the actors give nuanced
performances that just take you in and make you feel right at home. I

999605,4,6305240035,"Discovering Clay Pigeons was to me like discovering a stock certificate in my grandfather's attic and realizing it's worth some serious cash. Well, maybe not to that extent, but along the same lines.

PLOT: Clay Bidwell (Phoenix) is having a rough week. The dead body of one of his former girlfriends in found in a local lake, and a floozy he once hooked-up with is found stabbed repeatedly in her home on the outskirts of town. Everyone is suspecting Clay except for a amicable fella named Lester Long (Vaughn), who has a million dollar smile and the charm to back it up. It seems that everywhere Clay goes, death and Lester Long aren't far behind, smiling with a boyish grin and an ""I know something you don't know"" glare in his eyes.

It's hard to categorize Clay Pigeons. There are elements of hilarity and elements of suspense, but mostly, the film creates its own distinct vibe by taking the viewer into a bizarre world where death and humor are intermixed and the result is something rather brilliant. Phoenix and Vaughn both deliver masterfully in roles that suit their strengths. For Vaughn, playing a roguish miscreant who saturates his world with intellectual wit was something quite entertaining to behold. On the flipside, Phoenix is right at home in playing the role of a kid who is clinging desperately to his sanity as the world around him crumbles under the weight of accusation.

Overall, Clay Pigeons is a solid film that will keep you engaged to the end. If you're a fan of Vaughn or Phoenix, you won't be let down with either.",1214870400,4,1547,4.7011070110701105

999666,5,6305240035,"Clay Pigeons manages to combine the best of the dark comedy and psychological thriller genres, something that rarely works well (11:14 and The Boondock Saints might be two other good examples).  It's hands-down my favorite Vince Vaughn performance.  He plays a creepy lady killer (in the literal sense) with a charming twang and boisterous attitude.  As a viewer, I found myself empathizing with women who fall for serial killers!

Vince Vaughn plays the foil to small town boy Clay (Joaquin Phoenix), a nice kid who gets tangled up in a web of lies stemming from a desire to cover-up one romantic indiscretion.  In shocking succession, Vaughn's cowboy character racks up a series of murders and gotchas for the innocent Clay.  Toss in a sheriff who is straight out of Mayberry and a no-nonsense FBI investigator who occasionally imbibes in marijuana (Janeane Garofalo), and you've got a gripping crime story full of twists and comedic turns.",1176940800,2,942,5.04516129032258

The cast, camerawork, and direction are all outstanding but, as she often does, Janeane Garofalo adds so much to this darkly comic film. I never cease to be amazed at her range or sense of timing. Janeane actually has most of the more memorable lines in this film. It's really difficult to imagine anyone else playing agent Shelby as well as Garofalo.

The sequence with her and Vince Vaughn meeting at a local watering hole late in the film and the interplay between their characters is absolutely priceless. This scene alone is worth the price of admission.",1168214400,,655,4.6869565217391305
999670,5,6305240035,This is a great collection of performances.  Normally I can't stand Janeane Garofalo but she's amazing in this and she's the least amazing of the performances.  Both Vince Vaughn and Jaquin Phoenix are simply at their best.  Vaughn has such a perfectly disturbing blend of best friend and guy who would hack you to pieces if need be.  Absolutely great to see him in something with something he can chew on.  Phoenix does a great job as the scared rabbit caught in the middle of the twister ravaging the town.  Finally the score to this is pitch perfect.  It's a great all around film for those who like their comedies dark and biting but still with plenty of personality.,1140652800,2,671,4.588235294117647

Its scenes are exceptionally shot (the landscapes alone are enough to watch it, in my opion) and the acting is top of the line.  If you are attracted to the work of ANY of the members of this cast, you are sure to love their performances.

Now no, this movie isn't for the faint of heart, nor is it as light as a 'dark comedy.'  It's relatively intense, though not all that gory.  For sinister-veined, drama lovers, it's right up your alley.",1110153600,10,495,4.336956521739131
999772,4,6305240035,"If you liked Fargo, you'll appreciate this film. Very funny despite the dead bodies that start piling up. Vince Vaughn steals the show as Lester Long, with a creepy laugh sprinkling his unpredictable behavior. You'll feel sorry for Joaquin Phoenix's character Clay for the trouble he gets mixed up in, even though he's far from innocent, which you tend to forget along the way. My 7 year old was drawn out of bed by the sounds of Lester Long's big mouth, and he plopped down on the couch and immediately started laughing at Lester's antics and creepy giggling. The soundtrack was perfect, and you may find yourself with a little Elvis on the brain after you see this...I'll never be able to hear It's Now or Never the same way again....",1108512000,3,736,4.625954198473282

None of the characters are likable and the story is unbelievable. This isn't a sleeper, a cult movie, or an art movie. Its just a bad movie.

Earl commits suicide in an attempt to frame Clay for his murder...and with Clay's cover-up of that act, a chain of other terrible killings is sparked, as a charming, cowboy, serial killer, Lester Long (Vince Vaughn) senses an opportunity.
Dead bodies start turning up in ""Big Sky Country"" (Montana) and, unfortunately all of them, right under Clay's nose. Soon, the FBI turns up as well. Janeane Garofalo is great as the skeptical and sarcastic investigating agent.
This is a very well done dark comedy with a great cast - Vaughn is excellent, so are Garofalo and Joaquim Phoenix. Some great side characters are played by Scott Wilson (Sheriff Mooney), Vince Vieluf (Deputy Barney) and Phil Morris as the silent and brooding agent Reynard. A real keeper.",1032912000,27,1029,5.094674556213017
999776,4,6305240035,"I can't tell you much about the plot of the surprisingly well made Clay Pigeons without giving too much away. The movie's twists and turns are much of the fun. I can say that at one point, the town sheriff turns to young Clay Birdwell [Joaquin Phoenix] and asks him to quit turning up in places where a murder has been committed.
The picture is set in Montana, but most of its breathtaking photography was shot in Utah. The scenery underlines the story, for much of it is both beautiful and foreboding. All those vast open spaces hint at underlying danger, as well as vulnerability.
Joaquin Phoenix, whom we first saw ten years ago as a kid in Parenthood, has been very promising in movies like Inventing the Abbotts and Parenthood. Clay Pigeons should mark his transition into a serious actor. His speech patterns, facial expressions and body language make Clay Birdwell a character not soon to be forgotten. In the next decade, his imperfect, chiseled looks should make him a welcome balance to the pretty boy looks of talented actors such as Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio.
Clay shows us something not all of us want to see. A life can go on fairly routinely for years, then suddenly spin hopelessly out of control in one afternoon. What are we willing to resort to if that happens?
Vince Vaughn also shines in this picture. Here, his innocent school boy manner works much better than it did in the unfortunate remake of Psycho, where we all knew the story to begin with. Also first-rate is Janeane Garfalo, who plays an FBI agent. Garfalo is one of our finest character actresses. She's the type you've seen many times, but can never place her name. She is set to appear in no less than eleven movies this year. Her portrayal is a delight. I suspect she based it on Scully in X-Files. If so, hers is a wonderful parody.
Clay Pigeons succeeds in a very tricky genre, which I call black comedy about very bad things. You have to be very good at your craft to pull this category off. Usually, these movies end up being tasteless and offensive. An example of that is the current boxoffice hit Payback, which is among the most mean-spirited movies ever made.
Some will have a problem with Clay's choices at the end of the film. I liked it. It was refreshing to see a character not go for the easy way out.",1017187200,5,2305,4.5299760191846525

There is a lot of young and beautiful women being killed. But who killed them? Was it Clay Pigeons (Joaquin Phoenix is superb): stoic, ethical, quiet, and ...? Was is ""Lester the Molester"" (played so keenly and to utter perfection by Vince Vaugh): charming, lady-magnet, polite, yet deadly? You can ask the dominant, playful, ultra-spunky FBI agent who smokes pot. Or, you can ask the slow-witted and sleepy deputy sheriff who is so very funny in his ineptness.  But better yet; why don't you just buy the DVD? This is a perfect movie.  It's a thriller/comedy that is set in rural Montana in a town inhabited by the sly, the young, the corrupt, and the innocent.

It pulls you in and makes you wonder what's going to happen next. A few minutes into the film, however, it starts to show traits of some pointless independent movie. Luckily, it picks up when Janeane Garofalo, the dry and sarcastic FBI agent, steps in. Joaquin Phoenix, whose brilliance as an actor is becoming more evident with every progressive film, turns in a commendable performance. Vince Vaughn provides great comic relief as your stereotypical, insane cowboy. The rest of the cast is also brilliant, however subtle their roles are. Although not perfect, this film has a way of staying with you, with its quirky and fun soundtrack, offbeat performances, fast-paced and intricately woven plot, and desolate country setting.

999864,4,6305240035,"""Clay Pigeons"" has to be one of my favorite movies of all time. It isn't stunningly good or a film that is destined to be a classic, it's the equivalent of comfort food to me. I don't really have any comfort food, so I have a comfort movie. This movie makes me laugh so hard I almost die everytime I watch it and I have seen it about a million times. This is what a real comedy should be, hilarious but with humor that doesn't detract from the storyline. It doesn't contain jokes that seem to almost step outside the movie, like so many comedies do. It is great at taking horrific moments and somehow turning them into the most hilarious ones. Going fishing and having a body float up to your boat is not something anyone would find funny if it happened to them, but the scene in which just that happens has to be one of the funniest parts of the movie.  The acting is wonderful, too, which is definitely a plus. Of course everyone knows that Joaquin Phoenix is the greatest actor on the earth... or at least one of the greatest, so he is terrific in this movie as Clay, the main character. Vince Vaughn is great as well. His character is ridiculously funny, although I must admit, unrealistic. But he isn't supposed to be the kind of guy you find in real life, he is purposely a sort of cliche. I have seen this movie so much I almost think of it as being a tame family film, but really it isn't. With lots of murders and such going on it might scare some people. (i.e.-many people I know) But no one can argue with the fact that this movie succeeds brilliantly in its purpose--it is extremely funny.",969062400,,1601,4.2838283828382835
999865,4,6305240035,"In a small town out west, a target practice outing with a friend kicks off a chain of bizarre events that lead a man to involvement with murder and an  unsolicited alliance with a person of, shall we say, ""questionable""  character in ""Clay Pigeons,"" directed by David Dobkin.  Joaquin Phoenix is  Clay Birdwell, a regular guy whose lack of judgment and discretion catches  up with him unexpectedly in this dark, maddening tale of morality and fate  that is sometimes morose and disturbing, at other times darkly humorous, as  it deftly examines the trappings of the tangled webs we humans weave.  Clay  has become mired in a moral dilemma from which there seems to be no escape,  when he meets and is befriended by Lester Long (Vince Vaughn), a trucker  passing through town one night.  At a local bar, Lester observes that Clay  doesn't exactly have a way with women; it gets Lester's attention, which  leads to a game of pool and, later on, a casual fishing trip that, like the  target practice outing, proves to be a life-altering experience for Clay.  Phoenix is perfectly cast as Clay, ably conveying the effects of the dark  quagmire into which he is cast by circumstances he is unable to control.  His performance enables you to feel him sinking ever deeper as the story  moves along, and to empathize with him and experience what he is going  through.  You realize that he understands his situation, and it becomes a  matter of waiting to see if he will make the right decisions, regardless of  the inevitable consequences.  It creates a tension that makes you want to  yell at the screen to tell him what to do.  Vaughn is excellent as well as  the cowboy trucker with the winning smile, robust laugh and a closet full  of dark secrets.  There's a menace behind the good-natured facade he puts  on that becomes more pronounced as the events unfold.  Pretty early on you  know what this guy is all about, but somehow it only enhances the anxiety  of the whole situation as it becomes a cat-and mouse game (with some  unexpected twists) between Clay and Lester.  Another notable performance  comes from the charismatic Janeane Garofalo, who is surprisingly effective  and credible as F.B.I. agent Dale Shelby, who comes to town when things  take a turn and begin to heat up.  It's a credit to her talent and  versatility that she can pull this character off so well.  The  supporting cast includes Georgina Cates (Amanda), Scott Wilson (Sheriff  Mooney), Vince Vieluf (Deputy Barney), and Monica Moench (Kimberly).  There  are moments in this movie that absolutely make you want to tear your hair  out, a credit to the way Dobkin put this project together and delivered it.  ""Clay Pigeons"" is a nail-biter that will keep you going right up to the  end (which is terrific); Clay and Lester are characters you're going to  remember, and just to make sure there's a brief, inspired reminder at the  end of the credits (so stay with it all the way).  Relatively overlooked  during it's original release, this film should gain new life on video, and  deservedly so; this is one you'll be glad you took a look at.",966470400,7,3114,4.723364485981309
