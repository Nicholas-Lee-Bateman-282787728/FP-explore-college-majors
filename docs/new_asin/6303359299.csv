7844381,5,6303359299,This is a funny and crazy movie and it had us in stitches all the way through. I would recommend this movie for PG 17 and above because it has sexual innuendoes and adult content.,1369267200,,179,4.142857142857143
7844382,3,6303359299,"This movie is so incredibly dumb, but in a good way. That being said, if you enjoyed Airplane!, Top Secret, and it's ilk, you might enjoy this one as well.  I found it by chance in the local peddler's mall.  I brought it home to watch it, and within 5 minutes, I was busting up laughing! The plot is about Murray Creature, a 500 Lb alien who gets hooked on eating Italian.....people!!  My favorite parts, without giving any spoilers out, is in which 2 characters discuss the diffence between a pusher, a pisher, and a posher, using the exact same letters in every word: eg; ""The prussian posher in his Prussian porsha puts pressure on a pusher, who passes to a pisher."" It sounds dumb, but I found it hilarious. This horror/scifi spoof may not please everybody, but if you like stupidly funny stuff, this is for you.",1328832000,,816,4.5
