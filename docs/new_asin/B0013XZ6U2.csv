3120438,5,B0013XZ6U2,"First of all, you have to like the comedy of Bill Engvall to enjoy this DVD. If you don't think he's funny, the DVD will do nothing for you. But if you like him, as I do, the entire season without commercials is great!",1257724800,,218,3.977272727272727
3120439,5,B0013XZ6U2,"It's too bad Bill Engvall's show has been canceled!  This was one of the rare sitcoms our family of four could watch together and everybody enjoyed it:  parents, 10 year old, and 14 year old kids.  The cast was strong and kept things relatively clean AND it was funny!  It's a sad commentary on our society when everything -- and I mean everything -- these days is an ""unscripted"" show because they're so much cheaper to make.  Now we get served up 5 nights a week of Jay Leno in prime time?  Give me a break!  I agree with another reviewer that this was at least one show I didn't have to cover my kids eyes to watch all the way through.  Shame on the network for giving up on it too soon!  And please release the second season before my kids go to college (which is a not-too-subtle hint that there is a strong market for shows like this and others like it -- e.g., ""Family Matters"" which has yet to see the light of day on DVD and may not for another 20 years).",1254009600,2,964,4.139784946236559

3120441,3,B0013XZ6U2,"Thanks to the writers strike,there isn't much to watch on tv for the summer 08 season. So the alternative is too buy shows like this one to watch instead.

3120442,5,B0013XZ6U2,"We really enjoy Bill Envall's comedy, but living in the UK, we get to see precious little of his work. So we were pleased to see he had his own series available on DVD and weren't disappointed. It's great fun, with really likeable characters - this is well observed comedy and anyone with teenage kids will recognise many of the situations. It started slowly in the early episodes, but got better and better and it's just a shame that there were only 8 episodes in series 1. It left us really wanting more!
I read that the show has just started a second series on TV in the US, so hopefully there will be more episodes to enjoy this year and roll on the release of series 2 on DVD so that we can enjoy it here in the UK too!
Well done Bill.",1213228800,8,740,4.145833333333333
3120443,4,B0013XZ6U2,"This show is surprisingly good. The 8 episodes here feature some pretty original stories and solid writing. Engvall and Nancy Travis make for interesting if somewhat standard TV parents. The kids are your standard TV smart alecs but not as annoyingly so as most. The supporting cast, however, is less than good.
This is a fun little family friendly show and better than most sitcoms on TV these days",1211414400,6,399,4.797101449275362
3120482,1,B0013XZ6U2,"Tired, outdated, filled with stereotypes and lacking in real humor.  I watched this because I enjoyed Bill Engvall's comedy on stage, but his humor is watered-down here and the episodes are disappointingly dull.  Typical boring TV family: working dad, housewife mom, dumb teenage son, annoying teenage daughter, brainy youngest son, nasty neighbor, etc.  So predictable and mostly unlikeable characters.  Plus, there's a sharp thread of meanness that is woven throughout: cruelty to animals, gay bashing, sexism, etc.  Sometimes it just made me wince!  If you like Bill Engvall's comedy, watch his comedy specials.",1429747200,,614,5.548387096774194

3120487,3,B0013XZ6U2,"Mainly bought this to see some of Jennifer Lawrence's early work. She's clearly a background player in season one of this pleasant but underwhelming sit-com. But given the rare occasion, her talent and singular personality shines through.",1408320000,,238,5.45945945945946
3120488,4,B0013XZ6U2,"This series did not get off to a spectacular start.  It seems like standard mediocre fare at first, but it grows on you, thanks to some zippy dialogue and well-timed delivery by most of the cast most of the time.  Not bad for a live telecast (who even does those anymore?).  Give it a few episodes, and you may find a genuine chemistry emerging between characters both within and without the immediate family.  The snarky repartee among the children often carries the show and makes the sometimes anemic story lines worth it.",1402185600,,525,4.673913043478261

3120513,5,B0013XZ6U2,I chose the Bill Engvall Show because my family enjoyed it when the show was on television.

It's a pretty funny show.
