6094268,4,B00GNN3MO4,"I consider myself at an intermediate-advanced level of fitness.

Pros:  I worked up a major sweat and felt I got a great workout.  Unlike others in this series, there was less repetition of the sets which was great.  Doing 8 sets of the same thing can get a little boring.  The moves were simple and effective.  Production quality, camera angles, and music were all very good.  Backup dancer types were non-annoying (actually, the guy was rather inspiring considering the level of difficulty.)

Cons:  This really needs a music and cues only option on the menu.  This instructor is one of those with verbal diarrhea that talks non-stop.  On the one hand it is impressive that she can talk that much with such a tough workout.  On the other hand it is an annoyance that will only increase each time I repeat this workout.",1389398400,2,820,4.6573426573426575
6094269,5,B00GNN3MO4,I own all 3 Breathless Body workouts. What amazing workouts! I love the boxing influence in this one. I also love the ab workout at the end. Amy is so motivating but not annoying! Keep the amazing workouts coming please!,1388102400,4,220,4.525
6094270,5,B00GNN3MO4,"I call this accurate product naming. At least six of the eight segments does really leave you breathless. The moves were original and fun. Being able to choose your own level, is a big plus. I met the series with the third one but will definitely be checking the first two.",1388102400,2,273,4.372549019607843
6094271,5,B00GNN3MO4,I have the other two Breathless Body workouts and this one doesn't disappoint. This is a challenging workout that will have you pouring sweat and gasping for air. I can't wait for the next one!,1387411200,2,193,4.542857142857143
6094272,4,B00GNN3MO4,"Really 4.5 stars (can't give it a 5 till I've done it longer). This DVD is INTENSE. Unlike the last installment in the series, which focuses on a series of three exercises in each ""drill,"" BB3 focuses on one intense exercise in each drill (8 total) of four 40-second bursts with brief rest periods. Then on to the next one (with longer rests in between). As others have commented, some of the exercises are a bit complicated. To me, that's a bonus. It takes a round or two to learn, yes, but novel movements challenge and ultimately change the body. And that's what you bought this DVD for right? The visual countdown timer for each round is a bonus; it helps me get through the rough spots. If you're following the intermediate or advanced levels, trust me, you will be breathless.

I usually buy Jillian Michaels DVDS, so if that sounds like you, this will give you the sort of burn seen in BFBM, etc. Just when you finally finish with the tabata-style workout, they hit you with a round of very targeted ab moves. I found the whole thing really challenging and can't wait to do it again.",1386892800,25,1090,4.477386934673367
6094273,3,B00GNN3MO4,"I'm a big fan of Amy Dixon and was excited to receive this new DVD. A couple things that I didn't enjoy too much.  Several of the combos she did were too complicated and awkward for me.  Amy also wears a microphone on her head.  This video was not produced like Breathless Body 1 or Super Fit Bod.  In those videos I felt like she was talking directly to me, with that headset on, I felt a little detached and something was off.  I actually turned this DVD off mid-way.  I'll be doing her old videos tonight, the ones I love and the moves are more my style.  This might be a good DVD for those who are coordinated and pick up new moves easily, but it wasn't for me.",1386633600,6,665,4.069230769230769
6094274,4,B00GNN3MO4,"Wow, what a workout! I have her first 2 Breathless Body DVD's and looked forward to a new one. The first has been my favorite, I liked the setup and having only 3 people to watch. That is the case here too, Amy, Whitney for level one and Jason for level 3.
Each bodyweight drill lasts for 40 seconds followed by 20 seconds of light movement for recovery. The workout ends with a 4 minute boost going through all the exercises (similar to her Edge DVD) and a great pilates-style core blast for abs and a good stretch, something Amy is always great at.
I found this DVD much faster paced than her last and had to pause and look at some exercises the first time to make sure I was doing it correctly. A couple of exercises I changed because of my knees but kept the same intensity. I am hoping this new DVD breaks my new plateau as her old one did.
The ab segment was short but good and I was proud I could do level 3 after being humbled by the rest. ; )

A good, solid workout with Amy's trademark encouragement and cues. Just be prepared to sweat!",1386633600,29,1046,4.152709359605911
6094275,5,B00GNN3MO4,"Amazing work out!  I love this DVD entirely!  My body inside and out feels worked and ""breathless"" afterwards.  It is NOT for those that don't want to sweat or work out hard.  So amazing I had to order another one of these in Amy Dixon's series.  Have fun!!",1424131200,,257,4.270833333333333

6094279,4,B00GNN3MO4,My wife and I prefer BB 2 better.  This is good and we like the format but has more things like jumping on one foot and plane jacks that can be hard on knees and ankles.,1417305600,3,169,3.6944444444444446
6094280,5,B00GNN3MO4,Amy has again made anther great hiit workout. This one is different from her other two. The workout is 40 on and 20 off. And there is abs at the end of the workout.,1414195200,,164,3.8529411764705883

6094285,5,B00GNN3MO4,I love all of her videos. This one is a little tougher than the first 2 because the intervals are longer.,1408665600,,105,4.0476190476190474
6094286,4,B00GNN3MO4,Fun and GREAT that there are three intensity options depending on how you are feeling in a given day!  It goes by quickly too.  Would recommend.,1408492800,,144,4.5
6094287,3,B00GNN3MO4,"Good moderate workout. I just wish it was a bit longer so that I could burn a bit more calories (closer to 550). I didn't find the moves complicated at all, they are basic HIIT moves plus a bit of kickboxing tossed in. I like that she had 3 levels of intensity to choose from. I do wish however that I could mute her voice and just have music and the clock, I just found her talking very distracting if not annoying especially in the beginning.  I did the medium level the entire time and burned around 425 calories (using FT4 polar watch 125lb/5'3) here is my summary:
move 1 = 45 cal
move 2 = 55 cal
move 3 = 40 cal
move 4 = 30 cal
move 5 = 55 cal
move 6 = 40 cal
move 7 = 45 cal
move 8 = 30 cal
mb blast = 45 cal
abs = 40 cal",1407369600,6,728,3.6369426751592355
6094288,5,B00GNN3MO4,"I own the previous Breathless Body workouts and this one is just as challenging, if not more so. It's comprised of eight exercises that you do for four rounds of 40 seconds, with 20 second breaks in between. At the end, you do all eight exercises for 30 seconds each without stopping,  sort of like the end of Breathless Body 2. This is followed by a 4 minute abs routine and a quick cool down. Although some of the moves are from kickboxing, I didn't find the exercises to be overly dominated by kickboxing. I actually liked the change from the previous two Breathless Body workouts. As far as choreography goes, I didn't find the moves very difficult to learn and I'm not the most choreographically inclined. Amy Dixon is a fantastic instructor, who works out along with you and cues beautifully. Like the previous two, this workout also has three levels of difficulty, which I like very much.

The one downer and it was a big one was that this DVD did not have chapters. I didn't take away from the 5 stars because of this because this review is on the workout and not the DVD setup.  I did like that they added a timer on the bottom of the screen to show you how much time you had left. Perfection would be a DVD with both the chapters and the timer. I also didn't really care for the microphone set up. I felt like Amy was way louder than the music and the balance was nicer on the previous two DVDs.  I just have to mention that the picture of Amy with all the side boob is hard to look at on the back of the DVD case and on the disk itself. What?!

Bottom line is that this is a fun and challenging workout. I felt great after I finished and throughout the next day. Thank you for another amazing workout, Amy Dixon!",1407369600,,1723,4.256880733944954
6094289,5,B00GNN3MO4,"This is, by far, my favorite HiiT workout DVD.  I highly recommend!  It is an hour of one incredibly hard workout and it gets the job done. Since I've been using this and the other 2 Amy Dixon ""Breathless"" DVDs, I've lost 10 pounds and am in much better shape. I was already in great shape, but this type of workout has definitely increased my cardio endurance.",1407024000,2,361,4.373134328358209
6094290,5,B00GNN3MO4,"Great Workout, it will get you sweating!  However I still prefer the original Breathless Body...which kicks my butt each and every time.  But you will not be disappointed with this one.  Amy is a great instructor and you always feel energized after doing one of her workouts ....this one is no exception.... :)  I might be bias because she is the only instructor that really challenges my ability to do HIIT...lol",1406678400,,413,4.774647887323944

6094293,5,B00GNN3MO4,"I have all three of Amy Dixon's Breathless DVDs and have completed one of these workouts a week for the past four months.  They are a great way to supplement my running.  I consider my fitness level to be intermediate to advanced, and these workouts are challenging!  As I tell my husband each week after coming upstairs from the basement drenched in sweat, ""Amy kicked my arse again!""

I wouldn't say they are fun workouts, but I've never thought that HIIT workouts are fun.  They are meant to be challenging and to work your body at a high intensity.  Amy provides three different levels for each activity, and I have yet to be able to do the advanced level for all rounds.  It is great to have something to work up to!

I do recommend getting all three workouts to alternate through.  The exercises in each DVD are unique and the way they are completed are also unique.  For example, in Volume 1 there are 8 rounds of each exercise.  Each round is done for 20 seconds with a 10 second rest (Tabata style).  In Volume 3 there are 4 rounds of each exercise, where each round is done for 40 seconds with a 20 second rest.  Though it is the same amount of time, doing four rounds for twice as long has a very different feel (plus the exercises are different).  Volume 2 and 3 also have a metabolic finisher that are killers.

Thus far I have been sore after completing each DVD each week.  I also credit them for helping me lose 18 pounds of post-baby weight!",1401148800,4,1458,4.364312267657993
6094294,4,B00GNN3MO4,Not a fan of kickboxing blended in my workouts...the first will always be my favorite but amy delivers results with all her videos,1400025600,,130,4.695652173913044
6094295,3,B00GNN3MO4,"I recently purchased Breathless Body 3 and have done the workout twice. I also have Breathless Body 1. I really like the change in format-4 sets of 8 exercises. Each set lasts 40 seconds with a 20 second recovery. The moves are at times more challenging, which I like because it makes the workout more challenging. Amy is also very encouraging and her cueing is spot on. I only have one con.
I work out in the morning before my kids get up and doing a 60 min workout on a regular basis, just isn't practical for me. In the first video, the menu was set up in such a way that you could easily choose the circuits you wanted to complete or I could just do 4 or 6 of the 8 sets and then skip ahead. This allowed me to easily tailor my workout to fit the amount of time available to me on a given morning. You basically only have one choice on this video: play the entire workout. This morning I did two sets of each circuit and just hit the fast forward button. This did work but, I had to pay close attention to not fast forward to far. A bit of a pain. With the metabolic boost and core circuit, I was still pushing 45 min. So, for the most part I give this video a thumbs up, just wish it was easier to customize my workout.",1398211200,13,1224,4.041152263374485
6094296,5,B00GNN3MO4,The work out is great; I love her style and energy. I will buy more of her products in the near future.,1395014400,,103,3.727272727272727
6094297,5,B00GNN3MO4,"If you are looking for an intense workout, this is for you! I recently finished a bootcamp with a gym in my area and was looking for something at the same level. This was just as intense, if not more! i am no beginner to workouts, but I had to do many of the level 1 modifications in this workout. Amy is very encouraging, without being overbearing or annoying. She kept me going to the very end. I look forward to continuing this workout!",1394582400,,439,4.238095238095238
6094298,5,B00GNN3MO4,I am an advanced athlete and this one gives me a great workout and a challenge every time.  I have all three Breathless Body dvd's and it is my favorite of the three.  I love the sequence of exercises and the killer ab work at the end.  It's a total body workout and I'm always sore afterwards but feel like I took my fitness to the next level!,1394064000,3,344,4.029411764705882
6094299,5,B00GNN3MO4,"Amy Dixon does it again.  It's challenging, inspiring, and a great tabata style work out.  The end mega-workout that she does in VOl 2 is more manageable in this one since it's only 4 straight minutes versus 6.  I highly recommend this one.",1393891200,,240,4.534883720930233
6094300,5,B00GNN3MO4,"This Breathless is great! I love the other 2 videos from her Breathless series as well and was excited to purchase this newest one. Amy keeps the Breathless theme, but puts a different spin to each of the videos, which keeps you on your toes and reduces boredom. Keep on making these videos Amy!",1391472000,,295,4.481481481481482
6094301,5,B00GNN3MO4,I love this new breathless body working from Amy Dixon. I have all three of her breathless body workouts and each is great and different.  I like this one with the intervals being a little longer at 40 seconds and then only doing 4 of each move. In the first workout I got a bit bored of the same move after the 8 repetitions. I highly recommend this workout.,1391385600,,359,4.202898550724638
6094302,5,B00GNN3MO4,"A friend had given me the Breathless Body DVD to borrow and I absolutely loved it. So when I needed a few more items for Free shipping I added the Raise Some Bell DVD (another awesome DVD). And once again ran into the same issue and ordered the Breathless Body 3 because I've been reading how effective the HIIT can be and I have to say, I am so happy I ordered it.

I love the different levels every Amy Dixon offers in all of her DVDs, this one is no different. After completing the whole DVD I was surprised to see I was working out for over 55 minutes according to my heart rate monitor, while the work out was definitely challenging, the resting times and work outs keep you chugging along and not checking the clock! I love that this DVD also showed the time in the right corner.  It was nice to see how much time was left in each segment to keep you pushing a little bit harder. (BB 2 may have this, but I have not purchased that DVD at this time).

Overall, incredible work out that is still doable, I was dripping in sweat and burned over 400 calories. Thank you Amy! Another great home work out!",1391126400,3,1105,4.178403755868545
6094303,5,B00GNN3MO4,"I would actually rate it 4.5 stars, just because I do feel that the first Breathless Body is still the best in terms of being the most challenging; however, this one was even better than the 2nd one. I do all three of them now and enjoy them all. I'm a fairly advanced exerciser and stick to the intermediate to advanced levels in all of her workouts. I only did the intermediate level in this one and found it to be a great workout. Her format always makes the workouts go by so quickly for me, I think because you finish a drill and then move on to something else entirely. It just flows, and I'm never looking at the clock counting down the minutes as I do in other workout dvds, even those I like.

By far this series is my favorite of all of my at-home workouts.",1391040000,,767,4.147651006711409
6094304,5,B00GNN3MO4,"This is my favorite of the breathless body series.  It is fast paced and has just enough variety so the time just flew for me.  I was drenched in sweat at the end.  I like that there was a short abs portion.  I thought that the 40 second interval might be too much, but it was perfect.  It got my heart rate up and even with the 20 second recovery, my heart rate recovered slightly and I was able to complete the entire workout.  I actually like the longer work interval because it helps to push my heart rate up and it stays up.  The breathless body 2 is also a great workout for me.  I absolutely detest breathless body 1.",1391040000,4,624,4.099173553719008
6094305,5,B00GNN3MO4,Amy Dixon has made a very effective and fun workout. It has 3 different levels giving you the motivation to keep striving. Amy has really made a fun sweaty workout. She gives great form pointers and motivates you along the way. If you want to have fun while working out hard this is for you.,1390867200,,291,4.3090909090909095
6094306,5,B00GNN3MO4,"I absolutely love this HiiT workout from Amy - it has simple but powerful moves (with options shown for 3 levels), motivating music (I literally find it pushing me to work harder), and Amy's outstanding and upbeat instruction. The 40-second blasts with 20-second recovery breaks make for perfect drill sections to prevent boredom and give you sufficient rest after giving it your all. The moves range from plyometric to kickboxing to plank work, and you will definitely be breathless at certain points. And the beauty is, if you need to go easier or harder, the options are shown to you!

I hope Amy continues putting out the Breathless Body workouts - I have not yet been disappointed and there is no dread factor.

Keep up the amazing work, Amy!",1390867200,,747,4.782945736434108
6094307,4,B00GNN3MO4,"I found this one to be a bit tough on my knees.  I end up going for the beginner's versions of the exercises, but then don't get my heart rate up as much.  I'm also not a fan of kickboxing exercises, but I think that's because my form is off.  If something requires a particular form like that, I'd much prefer to do it in a separate video where the form is taught.  In this video, I feel like I'm flailing around with my kicks and punches in a manner that might end up hurting me (and if I slow it down, then I don't get my heart rate up).  So, overall, I really prefer the first two Breathless Body videos, and I hope Amy will steer it back in that direction.  I'd really like some more lower impact Tabata drills that will still get my heart pumping.  I was going to give this one a three-star review, but I added a star because you get an extra core workout with this one.  I enjoy having a little core work at the very end (since I don't get much in my daily life).

Update 4/12/14: I just wanted to mention that I've stuck with this workout, and my body has adjusted to it quite well.  I still have some trouble with a couple of the exercises, but overall, I've seen quite a bit of improvement.  The trick for me is keeping it slow and steady for the more difficult exercises, concentrating on form over trying to increase heart rate.  As my form gets better and better, so does my speed and therefore my heart rate.  I'm still hoping for some lower impact exercises in the next volume, but this is working out okay for me in the meantime.",1390780800,11,1545,4.144295302013423

This is my third Breathless Body video from Amy Dixon,and I continue to be amazed at how challenging,unique,and fun each one is! I With each of the Breathless body videos,I like how you can modify the exercises you want to,and still get an incredible workout. I am very picky when it comes to exercise videos,if I am not sweating buckets at the end,I feel dissapointed-not the case with HIT IT BIG or any of the other Amy Dixon videos.

6094311,5,B00GNN3MO4,"Love this video just like I love her first two in the series. Each one is set up differently, which is nice for the variety. Breathless Body 3 uses 40 seconds on, 20 seconds off unlike the other two which are 20/10. I don't prefer one to the other--I like the chance to do either depending on my mood. This one introduces some new cardio moves and as with the other two videos, all of them have three different levels demonstrated. In my opinion, this is a HUGE strength of these videos--the ability to modify based on the exerciser's level, so even a beginner could try these workouts, while those who are advanced can really get their heart rates up. As always, Amy is upbeat and motivating. She ranks among my favorite instructors, and I reach for her workout DVDs often.",1390780800,2,774,4.49645390070922

She is very inspiring and just when you want to give up...you push even harder to finish! I like how this workout incorporates the metabolic finisher AND the core workout also. It is the best way to finish up all that cardio with some abdominal work. I used my heart rate monitor and burned almost 700 calories!!! Another great part of the this workout, and all her workouts, is there is three different modifications to the workout, so if you are just a beginner to working out you can follow the beginner modification up to the advanced modifier if your looking for more.

8625132,5,B00GNN3MO4,"I've tried all 4 Breathless Body workouts and own 3 of them.  The only one I'm not fond of is 2, because I grew bored with it very quickly and did not feel as challenged.  3 is currently my favorite but it's a close tie with 1; 3 gets my heart pumping and 1 has a few moves that target areas I'm working on.  4 I primarily enjoy on days when I want to include light weights.",1485907200,2,374,3.831168831168831
8625133,5,B00GNN3MO4,"Breathless Body 3: HIIT It Big is a nice change from my usual Insanity routines. I purchased Amy Dixon's Breathless Body 3 and Breathless Body: Ultimate Calorie Burn based upon reviews I read as I needed something a little different to mix up my everyday routine from Insanity.  I should start with the fact that I am a Huge fan of Insanity and Insanity Asylum; I want to feel accomplished after my workouts by soaking in sweat and completely exhausted and challenged, but after 4 years of Insanity, I purchased these Amy Dixon videos to incorporate into those routines.  I personally like Body: 3 better than the original (Ultimate Calorie Burn), largely because of the longer routine intervals (40 sec on, 20 sec off, rather than 20 sec on 10 sec off as the first video).  I also liked the addition of the ab segment at the end.  My only wish if I could modify this video would to have a little longer and more challenging warm-up that included at least 3 minutes of stretching at the beginning.  Amy adds a good stretch at the end, but I like warming up and stretching prior to a workout as well as at the end; however, I just incorporate stretching into my 20 second ""breaks.""
As others have mentioned, 3 levels of workout intensities are demonstrated, so a beginner or someone a bit more out of shape could easily do this workout, I followed level 3 throughout so my comparisons are based upon that level.  This video is not Insanity as I do feel it is easier (Much easier than Asylum!) but for a workout variation, I enjoy it and I still am sweating and feel accomplished at the end.  The hour passes quickly and Amy does a nice job with explaining and encouragement.",1485302400,5,1673,4.5198675496688745
8625134,5,B00GNN3MO4,"This is an hour long and kinda tough. Trainers annoy me easily, she's not bad at all. With all her dvds there are two other people working out with her at different levels of intensity. She stresses that you can jump in and out of the different levels, the key is to keep moving. You will probably want to have her other dvds for variation, I can't see doing this one more than twice a week and I don't think you're supposed to.",1479513600,2,428,4.168674698795181
8625135,5,B00GNN3MO4,"Great workout, about the same intensity as the first Breathless Body.  Love the additional abs section,",1471219200,,103,5.4375
8625136,4,B00GNN3MO4,"This is my first Amy dixon breathless body dvd. I own a huge collection of exercise dvds as I prefer to work out at home (mornings , more convenient than going to gym!). I have a lot of Tae bo, michelle dozois, turbofire,insanity, so I'm fairly advanced.

I loved Amy's attitude. She is motivating without being annoying and I like the setup with Whitney and Jason doing the different levels. I also enjoy the TabAta style workout and it definitely is challenging! I found I needed to follow the intermediate instead of advanced modifications on some of them. Yhe reason for the 4 stars is because I dread burpees, not just because they are very challenging but that I get dizzy when I try them . There are burpees for one of the 8 drills. I ended up doing another plyometric move I learned from Michelle dozois' peak 10 dvds instead.
Overall, Im glad I bought this. I will try some of her other dvds and put them into the rotation!",1467158400,2,932,4.450292397660819
