8451829,5,B000U8CBMW,"I started in Real Estate sales when the market went down. At the time I was working with some prospects that I had a hard time getting to submit an offer. I wasted a lot of my clients and my time driving around and looking at homes.

I tried a lot of training materials that I paid a pretty penny for but none of them worked. Then I came across David Knox Real Estate Live DVD's and ordered 2 of them. The week after watching them, I submitted offers to purchase for both of my clients. I went from taxi driver to Real Estate agent over night.

I give credit for my first Real Estate commission to David Knox's Real Estate Live. His teaching is so easy to follow and he makes it fun to watch over and over again. His teaching is one of a kind and you will have a hard time not forgetting the important lessons he teaches. I had a couple of years of experience in sales before I became a Real Estate agent, 1 year experience as a Loan Officer, and it was not until I watched Real Estate Live that I knew what it means to be a sales person.

As a Licensed California Real Estate Broker since 2007, I highly recommend David Knox's products to every rookie and veteran Real Estate Agent that wants to increase their income. I use his DVD's for new agent training and had good results.",1221436800,2,1280,4.174089068825911
