189419,4,1572522380,"IRMA VEP is about the filmaking process, yes; it's also about the mysterious ways of people, how we choose to see the world, and want we want but, perhaps, cannot have.  Maggie Chung is lovely portraying herself as  the ""object"" of creative and personal affection.  The director of  a proposed remake of a silent classic sees her as the embodiment of his  artistic vision.  The character of Zoe, the person in charge of wardrobe  and costumes, sees her as a possible lover.  What's interesting about the  film is that no matter what expectation these characters have, there's the  question of whether they truly connect to reality?  In the end however,  does that really matter?  The ways of the heart, and art, are mysterious  indeed; sometimes benevolent, but frequently, as seen in the aspersions  cast rather carelessly by many on the film crew, self-serving.  Having said  this, Chung is nothing less than charming.  She radiates directness, and  perhaps as a dream sequence suggests, a little mischieviousness.  There's  humor to be found here, but also the heartbreak of missed connections; of  knowing or not knowing what one thinks or feels.  And yet, the creative and  emotional impulse seeks expression.  If you choose to view this film,  you'll be rewarded with a film of some insight into the human condition,  charm, and yes, a bit of melancholy.",953164800,3,1360,4.955357142857143
189420,1,1572522380,"It seems that director Assayas's lack of skills for storytelling made him try to disguise Irma Vep with some elements of interest (the remake of ""Les Vampires""; casting Maggie Cheung playing herself; trying to  show the making of a movie, etc..) just to hide he had nothing to say with  this film. There is no progression or development of characters or ideas on  this screenplay, contributing only to increase the lose of interest as the  film goes by. Everything that is said by different characters criticizing  American film industry and French intelectual movies just sounds  superficial when the movie you are watching cannot stand on itself because  of its own technical and artistical mediocrity.",920937600,4,704,5.12280701754386

189464,5,1572522380,"*In film noir the source of discontent is the tedious/repetitiveness of modern life, and the most tedious task we modern characters are forced to perform is the reproduction of (an unjust) social world. Film noir characters are thus rebellious sociopaths who refuse and resist in whatever way they can, but often the form their rebellion takes is itself tedious/repetitive and so these characters quickly become fatalistic/nihilistic.
*What is fetishized in film noir is crime itself. Because that is where the characters (and the audience members) experience their moment of rebellion, of freedom.
*Of course the crime can take many forms: a hiest, adultery, a murder, looking at a painting, reading or writing a book, watching or making or acting in a film, or simply being onself (off camera).
*Whats really wonderful about a fim like Beineix's Diva is that the crime is something as minor as illegally recording an opera and then stealing the diva's dress. In Diva, art (and art appreciation) is viewed as transgressive and exciting.
*And whats wonderful about a film like Lynch's Blue Velvet is that the originary crime is simply boredom which begets curiosity which begets investigation which begets spying which begets awareness of every other form of transgressive behavior which begets knowledge.
*In life most of us are forced to hide out from ourselves. We hide out from ourselves in jobs that we don't like, we hide out from ourselves in relationships that require us to act more socially presentable and acceptable than we feel like acting, we hide out from ourselves in suburbs, in family life, we hide out from ourselves in all kinds of ways. These jobs we take and the roles we play might be the very things that allow us to be ourselves, or at least certain versions of ourselves, but cinema is a place where we can acknowledge those other less social truths and less social selves that we must conceal in our everyday lives.
*Sometimes everything about life feels fraudulent and we can't wait to get to the cinema to get a dose of truth. At other times its just the opposite.
*Like Feuillade and Lang and Godard (and many other filmmakers), Assayas views the modern world as a series of enclosures and he locates the source of our discontent in the tedious professions that require us to occupy single enclosures and play single roles for extended periods of time. Godard's Breathless is wonderful because its about someone who is tired of playing a gangster but who simply lacks the imagination or will to perform any other role even though he seems like a natural actor. Irma Vep is wonderful because its about an actress who only comes alive (as herself) when she is not being viewed by anyone and can perform only for herself on the rooftops of Paris. In this film, the greatest thrill/crime is simply giving oneself the permission and freedom to be oneself.",1367366400,3,2880,4.89161554192229

189468,4,1572522380,"""Irma Vep"" is a 1996 cult classic about film and filmmaking written and directed by Olivier Assayas. It is a film for film buffs, which is its limitation. At the same time, it has a charming sense of humor not usually found in art house fare. Hong Kong actress Maggie Cheung, playing herself, arrives in Paris a the request of director Ren Vidal (Jean-Pierre Laud) to star in a remake of the 1915 silent French serial ""Les Vampires"". She is to play the leading role, that of Irma Vep, leader of a group of Parisian burglars who commit their crimes wearing black catsuits and hoods. The film's friendly costume designer Zo (Nathalie Richard) gets Cheung fitted into her latex catsuit and makes her feel at ease. But the director's state of mind is not as stable.

When I saw the holes in Ren's shoes, I suspected this might turn out to be something fun. Ren is a has-been director whom his own crew thinks past his prime and perhaps a little touched in the head. His recreation of ""Les Vampires"" does nothing to disabuse them of that notion. Zo doesn't like American films or the tendency of French directors to dwell in the past. Another crew member adores big Hollywood popcorn movies and disparages the French film industry for making films for themselves rather than for audiences. Maggie from Hong Kong is caught in the middle. Ren hates the dailies and might be having a nervous breakdown. And it's not clear why he would make a shot-for-shot remake of this old French classic -to him or to anyone else.

There is something delightfully realistic about the characters. Their minds are going off in different directions. Ren is losing his. Zo is having sexual fantasies about Maggie in the catsuit and hopes the actress is game. Maggie understands her character a little too well when she puts on that costume and begins to have criminal impulses. All of this on a chaotic, low-budget movie set. It's funny. The characters are fun to watch. It's easy to understand Ren's inspiration to cast the Chinese Cheung as a Parisian burglar. Maggie is captivating and easy-going. She's the calm amid the chaos who lets everything wash over her, like the audience. In English and French with optional English subtitles.",1319760000,,2213,4.745454545454545
189469,4,1572522380,"I feel downright churlish for not going completely crazy for this funny/sad look at movie-making -- specifically the rather absurd, doomed remaking of a real French classic, by an aging, out of style art-house director, starring Hong Kong action heroine Maggie Chung, who plays herself delightfully.

I enjoyed the film; its sort of a complex 1990s `Day for Night', with a paradoxical and sometimes confusing point of view about the nature of art and the state of film.

But I couldn't see it for the masterpiece a number of intelligent critics gave it credit for being.  Jonathan Rosenbaum, the terrific critic from the Chicago Reader wrote a very long, in depth analysis that went right over my head, and then added insult to injury by implying that people who don't see the film as
a deep investigation of the evils of capitalism, and the meaning of ART are somehow shallow.

I'm also surprised by the number of people who take the ramblings of an obnoxious reporter in the film about the death of French art cinema as being the film's point of view on these issues.  To me the film isn't taking sides, and seems to be gently satirizing, and yet embracing all of film.

Good natured, well acted, and occasionally brave (but also occasionally obscure) I quite enjoyed this and it did provoke some thinking.  But I couldn't see it as the super deep film some did. For me, it was fun, but the ideas are far less deep or radical then critics seem to want to give them credit for being.",1308096000,,1484,4.619771863117871
189470,3,1572522380,"Very modern and very French comedy about filmmaking, art and everyone else involved in the process.  Maggie Cheung arrives to Paris from Hong Kong in order to create her first ""art"" movie.  Her past acting experiences featured her athletic abilities in martial arts movies.  Her casting in the French director's remake of the silent movie about vampires is her chance to break the mold and casting stereotype.

Just observing the fuss and lack of organization of the film's crew is funny in itself.  What adds to the comedic feel is the cultural and language divide.  But the best part is watching Maggie in her black latex catsuit that makes the funniest little noises one can expect from the action figure ""cat woman"" bomb shell.  The obsession with Maggie's beauty is shared between the director and her costume designer.  When the original director goes through a nervous breakdown there is a change of guard and the enthusiasm for Maggie seems to disappear overnight.

This is definitely not a movie for everyone.  One must enjoy european cinema to get through this film.  But what I really liked about the movie is the soundtrack.  Some very, very French music and singing is what makes this film easier to tolerate.",1249430400,,1222,4.878640776699029
189471,3,1572522380,"Irma Vep (Olivier Assayas, 1996)

Assayas' homage to Contempt gets very interesting about an hour into the film, when we find out that Maggie Cheung (playing herself) is not all she seems. From there, it is riveting. Unfortunately, however, getting to that point may be something of a chore.

The plot: washed-up director Rene Vidal (Jean-Pierre Leaud) is hoping to revitalize his career by remaking Feuillade's classic serial Les Vampires. He casts Cheung, who speaks no French, in the title role, leading to a comedy of errors on the set. Costumer Zoe (Code Inconnu's Nathalie Richard), who is in lust with Cheung, quickly becomes her best friend and staunchest defender on the set, and much is made of the subplot of whether the two will get together. Much of the rest of the tension in the film comes from trying to figure out whether Vidal, who's getting more and more haggard as the shooting drags on, will be able to complete the film without having a breakdown.

The first hour of the film is desperately meta, aping the French New Wave whilst simultaneously paying it homage (and who better here than Jean-Pierre Leaud, who may have been involved in more universally-lauded French films than any other living actor?); all that's missing is Jean-Pierre Melville, but even his infamous and wonderful interview in Breathless is quite nicely aped by Cheung and an antagonist reporter (Antoine Basler). Still, if meta doesn't appeal to you, you're going to have a tough time with it. That said, once it takes off, it really takes off, and the final scenes of the film, when the cast and crew screen what Vidal has put together, are absolute genius. That movie I'd have paid good money to see. ***",1201564800,,1700,4.815068493150685
189488,3,1572522380,"Irma Vep is a fictional behind-the-scenes film.  Hong Kong actress Maggie Cheung stars as Maggie Cheung, a Hong Kong actress starring in a French remake of an old silent film.  The most interesting dynamic of this film are the interaction and tensions between these multiple layers.  Cheung's character starts to have trouble differentiating between the role that she plays and reality.  The director of the fictional French film chose the fictional Cheung because her previous Hong Kong work recommends her for the part;  viewers of the film Irma Vep will also be influenced in what they think of the character because of films of the real-life Maggie Cheung (Super Cop) that they have presumably seen.

The main tension of the plot revolves around four main plot threads:  the character Maggie Cheung seems to get too much into her Vampire-like cat burglar character, the formerly-great French director of the film seems to be going through a personal crisis and perhaps even a nervous breakdown, the rest of the crew--especially the assistant director--have trouble understanding the director's vision and the casting of Cheung in the lead role, and the costume director has a secret crush on Cheung.  Irma Vep is an entertaining film about a film production that is in the process of unraveling under the strain of all of these tensions.

The film is interesting, but there are problems in the execution.  I would have liked to have seen more of an exploration of the plot threads that I described above.  The film sets up interesting situations, but then leaves the viewer dangling.  In one scene the Maggie Cheung character tries out an act of burglary, but how does that relate to everything else going on in the film?  Is it simply a case of Cheung getting too much into character or does this have something to do with Cheung's strange reluctance to talk about her previous film production which apparently also suffered problems?  The lesbian crush subplot doesn't really go anywhere--after watching the costume designer's crush on Cheung throughout the film, this culminates in Cheung's embarassed giggling when she finds out about the crush.  There seems to be some kind parallel between the ways that the Cheung character is magnetically attractive both to the costume designer and the director--maybe this even has something to do with the vampire-like attributes of the character that Cheung's character is playing, but again the film makers hint at this without developing it.

Overall I enjoyed the film.  The open nature of the script allows different viewers to see different things.  I can appreciate this, but I guess I would have like to have seen more of how these interesting situations played out rather than just settling for an interesting setup where the viewer can imagine what it means and where it will go.",1152489600,3,2837,5.0127931769722816
189489,4,1572522380,"Irma Vep elicits two reactions from different groups of people: nay sayers who view it as yet another boring French film and people who focus on the film-about-a-film. I think it is seriously misleading to view the film in either of these lights. Irma Vep should be viewed as a series of short films, tied together by the ""plot""  of the film. Each mini-plot is fascinating and together make the film wonderful.

If you don't know, Irma Vep is a movie about a Hong Kong action star (Maggie cheung) who arrives in Paris to do a remake of a 1915 French film about the French underworld. The director is losing his emotional stability and eventually the crew unravels. A lot has been said about the ""film within the film"" aspect of the movie, so I won't say more.  What I think is fascinating is how the director tells a number of stories within this strange plot:

- The crash and burn of a film crew

- Zoe, the costume designer who is attracted to Maggie and she is rejected

- Maggie's desire to indulge in her criminal fantasies

- the director's strangely engaging mini-film

Since all this takes place in the middle of chaos, it can be hard to appreciate at first. There is really no beginning or end of the film. It is abrupt, which I think must reflect the experience of someone who arrives in the middle of turmoil. But each mini-plot is lovingly filmed and well acted. It also helps a great deal that Maggie Cheung is an attractive actress who can really carry well while wearing a latex suit the director insists she wear. The rest of the cast puts in a great performance as well, which allows you to engage with the other characters. On top of that, the film has lots of great shots - the weird footage at the end, Maggie sneaking through the hotel, the obligatory French dinner party, an incisive slam on the French film indusrty, etc..

Definitely worth it for people who can tolerate unusual plot structures and who enjoy beauty in unusual places. Check it out.",1097971200,24,1973,4.504201680672269

However, I did find ""Irma Vep"" to be a charming piece of work. I'll try not to be biased since I am a huge fan of Maggie Cheung. Maggie gives what else?...another delightful performance. Fans of her HK films will probably enjoy seeing Maggie in the flesh acting like a normal person. She looks radiant with very little makeup and dressed down in jeans. It is a good look behind the scenes and the squabbling on a movie set. I was unsure if this was supposed to be a satire since French cinema is not my forte.",1095120000,2,628,4.3760683760683765

This tale of a has-been director attempting a comeback with a re-make of a silent French serial (and using a non-French speaking real-life Maggie Cheung in the title role) is the ultimate exercise in cinematic intertextuality.  But it's also a lot ofe fun and not--as one of the film's own characters grouses about the state of French cinema--just intellectual navel gazing.  Not for everyone, of course, but for lovers of cinematic irony, it's hard to think of a more delightful feelm.",1078617600,,542,5.0
189492,4,1572522380,"I truly fail to understand those who consider this a serious cinematic masterpiece.  It pales in comparison, for instance, with other  Maggie Cheung vehicles such as ""In the Mood for Love"" or ""Song of the Exile"".  Indeed, one of the four rating stars is purely for the presence of Maggie as something at least close to her off screen persona (ok, I admit to a bit of a crush here :-).

On the other hand, it is not the abysmal drek others rate it.  The plot is drolly amusing, along the lines of a mid-level American TV sitcom.  And as one who has been in similar situations a few times, the depiction of Maggie's perplexity and detachment when thrust into making a film in Paris while speaking no French rings true.

The side-plot of Zoe, the costumier, who develops a crush on Maggie while fitting her with the black latex catsuit in a Paris sex shop, is amusing and well handled.  Nathalie Richard is just right (and dang cute) as Zoe, a grown woman regressed to breathless teenage puppy love.

Maggie wanders through it all with gracious aplomb as everything and everybody is falling apart around her, intrigued by Zoe's interest though ultimately declining.

For those who haven't read the previous hundred reviews, a brief summary: Maggie Cheung, playing herself, arrives in Paris on a movie set in chaos.  The director has chosen her to play the part of a cat burglar (Irma Vep) in a remake of a classic silent film, on the basis of obsessive viewing of Cheung's Hong Kong action films (I think it was Heroic Trio he was watching).  [Real life director Assayas was Cheung's boyfriend, later husband. Art imitating life, or vice versa?]  Maggie is the calm center of a swirl of studio politics, backbiting and romantic advances (male and female).  She goes to a late night party, and one night dreams (?) that she gets tricked up in her cat suit and burgles another room in her hotel.  The director, dysfuntional at best, eventuallly has a breakdown.  A new director decides he needs a French actress to play a classic French role, and Maggie accepts calmly(probably glad to get out of this mess).  The last we hear is that she has cashed in her return ticket for a flight to New York to meet an American director.",1066694400,3,2220,4.608142493638677

189495,4,1572522380,"Well, are we all sitty comfybold on our bottys?  Then I'll begin.
Olivier Assayas is such a great director with such an astonishing body of work, that as good as Irma Vep is, it is not one of his best films.
It is good enough that you really should buy it, if you have not already.  However, beyond that, in my typical whiny, frustration-driven way, I am going to spend the balance of this essay on things you (we) cannot yet buy in the hopes that one of the smaller and more rational DVD companies will rectify this.  None of the following are even on video in France, at least based on the Amazon.com.fr website.
Une Nouvelle Vie is a brilliant character study.  This film reconfirmed to me to the great and subtle talent of Judith Godreche, who has never let me down since.  (Of course, I did not see the DiCaprio foolishness she was in because that would have broken the No-DiCaprios Allowed rule.)  Ms. Godreche plays a complex and multi-layered character faced with a deepening mystery as she tries to find a father she has never known and is stalled by her half-sister and her father's lawyer who is apparently friendly, but clearly has some agenda of his own.  The use of the camera is simply staggering.  The camera circles the protagonists, alternating their points of view as the psychological games proceed.  This same effect was so very irritating in Branagh's Frankenstein because there it served no purpose.
L'Eau Froide is a 60's period piece which introduced me to the work of Virginie Ledoyen.  A simply plotted story of disaffected youth, which in less talented hands would have been cliched, is confidently and masterfully turned into something much more.  This film also has what I feel to be the most effective (because it is so sparing) use of ambient period music I have ever experienced in a film - turning a great scene into an utterly ecstatic sequence.  (The Big Chill indeed!!!!!  Hmpf.)
Paris S'Eveille was my fortuitous introduction to, not only Ms. Godreche, but Mr. Assayas himself.  The Walter Reade at Lincoln Center was running a series of films featuring Jean-Pierre Leaud.  Having seen all of the more easily available films in the series, I chose I Hired a Contract Killer because it was directed by Aki Kaurismaki and Assayas' Paris S'Eveille because the music was written by John Cale.  In fact, I had already had the bande sonore CD for a couple of years without knowing anything about the film.  I'm sure I would have run into the work of Mr. Assayas eventually (probably, ironically, at The New York Film Festival where I saw Irma Vep) but this jump-started a cinematic passion that endures to this day.
Everything is relative.  If you have not seen and do not own (anything worth seeing once is worth seeing twice - otherwise it is not worth seeing at all) Irma Vep then you owe it to yourself to make up for that loss.  When you do, pay particular attention to Nathalie Richard.  Even given the presence of Leaud and Maggie Cheung, Ms. Richard is the subtle heart of the film.  I wish that more of her films were available here.",1018137600,3,3074,4.645101663585952

Perhaps there is merit in filming soup cans and walls and splicing together a lot of scenes; this film is kind of like that in my view. Please don't expect any  vampire content or for that matter any real content at all.",1451606400,,385,4.065789473684211
7797694,4,1572522380,"A great performance by Maggie Cheung. It's the story of a Hong Kong actress( yea a stretch) who goes to Paris to remake ""Les Vampires"" which she takes the role a little to literally. Oliver Assayas made the film more as a series of vignettes than a whole movie. Might be a tedious to non cinephiles but for those who enjoy inside of movie making like Truffaults ""Day for Night,"" will most appreciate it. Non foreign cinephiles need not apply.",1446249600,,442,4.5375
