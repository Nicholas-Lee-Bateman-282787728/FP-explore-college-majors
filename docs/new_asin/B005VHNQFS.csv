It has the element of romance, history, and a little flavor of comedy all in one show. The lead actress  (Zhao Wei) was absolutely gorgeous for her role as  (Xiao yan zi). The supporting cast members, production, script were perfect as well.",1369526400,,338,4.6
8487477,5,B005VHNQFS,"I know this series as Returning Pearl Princess, but it is also known in English as My Fair Princess.  It is at turns zany comedy, Kung Fu action, love story, melodrama and for me it was an insight into the Chinese way of thinking...how power is dealt with, how one can get around official policy, how to find freedom in a highly structured society.  Above all, this TV series is full of charm.

The plot in brief:
Set in the Qing dynasty, this is the story of Xiao Yan Zi and Xia Ziwei.  Ziwei is the lost daughter of Emperor Qianlong who many years before had an affair with Ziwei's mother.  Ziwei, along with her attendant Jinsuo go in search of a way to claim her heritage and find her father in the Forbidden City.  On the way, they meet Xiao Yan Zi, an orphan and wild child who lives by her wits.  Just getting into the Forbidden City is fraught with danger, but pales in comparison with the perils of the royal court.

Huan Zhu Ge Ge launched the careers of three actresses (Vicki Zhao Wei, Ruby Lin and Fan Bingbing) and racked up the highest viewership of any television drama in Chinese history.  It is a MUST SEE for any aficionado of Chinese culture, even though this edition HAS NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES (one exists somewhere, but I have yet to see it for sale).  However, Vicki Zhao is so delightful to watch and fills her character, Xiao Yan Zi, with such energy and humor that its easy to get caught up in this story despite the language barrier.  This is a 2 DVD set that covers the first season and is very high quality reproduction.

I think that perhaps the key to the popularity of this series is not only the wonderful cast but how it encapsulates the struggles of an emerging youth culture VS established regime in China.  Xiao Yan Zi and Xia Ziwei personify the duality of China, the former a wild individualist, and the latter representing tradition and obedience.  A whole country could see themselves in this cultural mirror.  Danger is as present as the promise of a new life, consequences are real, but no personality or situation is carved in stone; a princess can be wise and foolish, a king imperious and kind and even an evil queen has her reasons as well as a soft side.

It bares repeating, there are no English subtitles.  The physical comedy and Kung Fu go a long way toward making up for that.  The main theme, the wish for a fulfilling and unrestrained life is made clear past any limit of language.",1357257600,,2434,4.431460674157304
