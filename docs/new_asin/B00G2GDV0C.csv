8620186,5,B00G2GDV0C,"I just saw this film in Tijuana, Mexico. I must say it was worth the trip from Los Angeles to Tijuana just to watch this film at the Jewish Film Festival in Tijuana, Mexico. It is a very difficult topic to develop in a contemporary film. The complexity of this region makes it hard at times to believe if it happened or not but the most important, at least to me, was the human side of both sides. It was marvelous on how in the main story both characters made a connection with the soccer ball and then the olive tree. Wow, I will recommend this movie to anyone who wants to expand their horizons in films and/or if you want to scape a bit from the special efx/ senseless car chases or movies that insult our intelligence etc... And yes I am buying this film to add to my collection of films.",1423353600,,793,4.189542483660131
8620187,4,B00G2GDV0C,"This film moves along well, tells an engaging story that is part coming of age and part buddy film, while at the same time providing a glimpse into the difficult dilemma of Palestinian/Israeli relations.",1400025600,,203,5.0
8620188,2,B00G2GDV0C,"The focus of the movie was suppose to be on the unlikely friendship between an Israeli downed pilot and a young Palestinian boy living as a refugee in Lebanon. The writer & director in downplaying/avoiding the backstory of the intense emotional and factual discord between Palestinians and Israelis results in a movie lacking realism. Also, little backstory on the boy's mothers death before the film starts or the boy's fathers death seemed shallow. Similarly we are given little in the daily life of this boy's family.

The entire episode of the pilot (obvious white guy w/visible handcuffs visible all the time) and boy escaping and traveling such long distances without drawing much attention seemed contrived as did the boy's warming to the pilot despite a life surrounded by Palestinian causalities incurred by Israelis; especially death that rains down from the sky.

Finally, the ending where the boy is sent back to what is likely to be his death for his role in the loss of such an important trade asset seemed unlikely. Also unlikely, given that an Israeli soldier is worth a thousand Palestinian prisoners or hundreds of thousands of dollars in reward, is that the boy received a pair of shoes and sunglasses as his remuneration.
More challenging and interesting would have been an Israeli boy and Palestinian fighter as prisoner.",1394928000,5,1342,5.04054054054054

8620190,5,B00G2GDV0C,"I'm a big fan of Israeli cinema.  I think of all the great films I've seen from there and put two of Eran Riklis's films in my top five:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lemon-Tree/dp/B004GL6ZXU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lemon Tree</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Syrian-Bride/dp/B000EHQ7JC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Syrian Bride</a>.  If pressed, I might declare 'Bride' my all-time favorite.  When I think of an Eran Riklis film, I think about borders...the Golan Heights (Bride), the West Bank (Lemon Tree).  When an Eran Riklis film gets near a border, great film-making is the result.  It happens again here in 'Zaytoun' when the director shifts his gaze north to the divide between Israel and Lebanon.

'Zaytoun' is carried by its two stars, Stephen Dorff, totally believable here as an Israeli soldier, and young Abdallah El Akal who plays Fahed, the unlikeliest of saviors to Dorff's Yoni.  The film also features good performances by Ali Suliman (a staple in this type of film) and Alice Taglioni, the French beauty who made such an impression in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Valet-La-Doublure/dp/B000SSQ7JC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Valet (La Doublure)</a>.

While I did enjoy Riklis previous outing,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Human-Resources-Manager/dp/B005J47QQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Human Resources Manager</a>, it was slow and perhaps just an acquired taste for those of us who'd read the book upon which that film was based (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Woman-in-Jerusalem/dp/B001OMHT02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Woman in Jerusalem</a>).  'Zaytoun' is a full return to form by Riklis and his winning formula.",1387065600,,1895,7.5
8620191,3,B00G2GDV0C,"Directed by Israeli director Eran Riklis (The Syrian Bride, Lemon Tree), Zaytoun - a film set in war-torn 1982 Lebanon about a Palestinian refugee boy who helps a captured Israeli pilot escape and make his way back to Israel - is not a bad film.  But that said, it's not a good one either, mainly because, for all of its merits and its potential, the only times when it isn't predictable are when it also simply isn't believable.

Fahed (Abdullah El Akal) is a fourteen-year-old Palestinian boy living in a refugee camp in Lebanon with his father and grandfather. The year is 1982 and Lebanon is one big war zone divided among myriad factions, from various Lebanese and Palestinian militias to Syrian and Israeli military forces, all vying for control. Some of the film's best scenes are the early ones which show what life is like for Fahed, his family and his friends, as they try to eke out an existence in a country where they're not wanted and where they daily take their lives in their hands just crossing from one part of Beirut to another. Fahed's father scolds him for risking his life just to earn what little money he can get from hawking gum, but at the same time knows that the family needs those meager coins to survive. His father clings to hope in the form of a potted olive tree that he carefully tends each day, a tree that he hopes to one day take back to the family's home in Israel which they had been forced to leave when Fahed was only a small boy and that Fahed can only barely remember.

After his father is killed in an Israeli bombing raid, Fahed becomes more involved with the local Palestinian militia, just when an Israeli jet is shot down over Beirut. The pilot, an Israeli named Yoni (Stephen Dorff), is captured and taken to the militia's headquarters where he is held with the intention of exchanging him later for a hundred Palestinian prisoners held by the Israelis. At first Fahed is understandably quite hostile towards Yoni, but when one of his friends is killed while trying to cross one of the zone boundaries in Beirut, Fahed decides to help Yoni escape and make it to the Israeli border - but on the condition that Yoni help him get into Israel so that he can return to his family's village and plant the olive tree his father had tended so carefully until he was killed. This is only the first of a number of implausible moments in the film which keep it from being as good as it had the potential of being.

Note: though it's never made explicit in the film, the title - Zaytoun - is the Arabic word for ""olive"". The symbolism is a bit heavy-handed, but even so it does tend to resonate and might actually have worked if the film had not been so simplistic in its approach and so implausible at various points, requiring things to happen because of the demands of the plot rather than flowing naturally from the needs of the characters.

For all of the problems with the plot, the acting in Zaytoun is quite good overall, in particular Abdullah El Akal's Fahed, who embodies the harsh realities of being a child in a time and place that doesn't allow for much of a childhood for anyone. I did have some trouble though in buying into Stephen Dorff's Yoni. Dorff came across as simply too American to be believable as an Israeli pilot, particularly when sharing screen time in Zaytoun - which was filmed in Israel - with real Israeli actors.

Recommended if you can live with minimal expectations and a willingness to periodically suspend disbelief.",1384041600,5,3492,4.534920634920635
