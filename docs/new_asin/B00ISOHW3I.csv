8645063,1,B00ISOHW3I,This is the worst Godzilla movie that I have ever seen. Because this movie takes place in a real world that the kaijus doesn't exist. This is the worst Godzilla film that I ever seen. It is the first Godzilla film that it's for children. Other Godzilla movies are great to watch such as Heisei series and more violent than this crap.,1519171200,,333,4.387096774193548
