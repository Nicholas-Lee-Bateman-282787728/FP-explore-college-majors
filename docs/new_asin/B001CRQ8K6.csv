Try what they suggest for a week or two, then make your own judgement.  You will, most likely, be completely amazed and thrilled!",1221868800,18,274,4.787234042553192
3517421,5,B001CRQ8K6,"I have effortlessly lost 20lbs in just six weeks! Adopting this lifestyle can potentially make Bariatric and Gastric bypass surgery obsolete! Statistically, 1.5 million Americans die from heart disease annually. This DVD will definitely change that! As a practitioner of Herbology and Naturopathy, I have finally discovered THE most critical element in the healing process. Without question, A PLANT BASED DIET IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN ANY HEALING PROTOCOL. If you suffer from ANY degenerative disease (Heart disease, Diabetes, Cancer, etc.), you must first part company with the Standard American Diet (SAD) and secondly you must adopt a plant based diet, in order to conquer and overcome your condition. Using a plant based diet, the Gerson Clinic (World renown for its Cancer therapy) has successfully cured Diabetics, in just two weeks! This DVD has changed my life and it will definitely change yours. It is truly a life saver! Buy it and share it with family and friends. Michael Anderson's latest installment, ""Healing Cancer from Inside Out"", is equally as dynamic! I highly recommend it. I give them both, FIVE stars! ""The greatest gift than one can give his fellow man, is the gift of health"". Michael Anderson has given us just that! Bravo!",1219276800,123,1259,5.146341463414634

3517423,1,B001CRQ8K6,"I had thought that it would be interesting and actually teach me something, but it didn't and is severely lacking in detail and logic.  Not far into it you'll discover that it's all about a vegan, raw food, plant based diet and nothing more.  Okay, I get it, some people believe that people aren't omnivores, but then it gets worse.  There are some interviews with doctors in it, but no studies are cited, no sources for any of these beliefs are cited, just claims which go from acceptable to nuts beginning with one person that feels better and more energetic to an HIV positive person that stopped taking her doctor's advise and changed her diet to vegan as a cure.  Come on!  Is this the best pseudo-science that they can come up with?!

3517428,4,B001CRQ8K6,"Low budget but high value. A lot of science based evidence for ditching the meat and dairy and cutting over to plant based, whole foods.

Heart disease, Cancer, Type II Diabetes, Alzheimer's, Fibromyalgia, Arthritis, Asthma, Erectile dysfunction, on and on,  The list of prolific killers and cripplers of Americans does nothing more than grow. We have the answer to prevent, halt and regress all these diseases and it isn't pills or expensive, life threatening surgery. It's literally right in our back yards, plants. No one will tell us and it's fairly obvious why. In a for-profit health care system such as ours, there's NO money in healthy people. We have GOT to advocate for ourselves and take personal responsibility for our own and our family's healthcare. The only way we'll beat the current, financially motivated and Government backed, system that is making us all sick is to stay out of that system. We have the power.

The documentary also goes on to talk about the environmental cost in raising and maintaining livestock for food. It's eye opening. So much energy is consumed feeding and raising these animals that ultimately will be eaten. A massive amount of the earth's surface is purely there to support the livestock industry. It's mind boggling. It's unsustainable and we need to get the word out.

From a personal standpoint, I went vegan some 8-9 months ago shortly after a Coronary Heart Disease diagnosis. I've lost weight, lowered my BP drastically, brought down my cholesterol and reversed my Coronary Heart Disease. I'm living proof this stuff works. It's down to YOU to take control of your life.

This documentary explains so much, and its content is mind- boggling.  I was first introduced to this documentary in college, by my health professor.  It astonished me so much, I had my family and friends watch it as well.  We try to eat less meat, my dad stopped eating meat, and feels much better, and more energized.  This video not only discusses the effects on the body, but on the environment as well.  Great Documentary, I would love to see an updated version, as this one is a few years old.

I was very disappointed in the loose use of facts however.  He makes broad unsubstantiated claims.  For example, half of our water supply goes to feed farm animals.  Half our water supply is polluted by feeding farm animals.  If that is so why do we have fresh water at all?
A lot of his pictures were meant to make us feel horror.  But they were pulled from all kinds of sources not really related to where he put the pictures.  Just picture after picture to have something on the screen to make our bellys crawl.  A picture of a lab monkey from the 1950's?  Why slip that one into the mix?

The first reason is for the film being very boring. The information in this film was presented in a way that made it very hard to get through. I would have not finished it, but I had to watch it for an ethics class. My professor is an animal rights activist convincing the class that a vegan diet is the healthiest in the world.

The second reason I gave it two stars is for the very information presented. The documentary talks so much about all of the propaganda in the food industry which I completely understand. My complaint is that this film also has a lot of propaganda in it. I could spend so much time on this subject that I could probably write a book about it. Simply put, the facts and studies mentioned in the film are very broad and vague. There is little to no science behind some of the claims in the film, just lots of testimony and facts about how common disease has become. I agree that diet and health are directly related, but come on, animal products being the cause of all disease? That's just ridiculous. Some cultures, including people from the arctic and even east africa, have a diet consisting of almost all meat. There are studies that have been done on these meat eating cultures, showing very low instances of heart disease and cancer. My animal rights activist ethics teacher had my class watch this in order to 'convert' meat eaters. It's too bad that it works too, because there are a lot of ignorant people my age who will believe anything they hear if it sounds compelling enough.

The third reason I have this documentary two stars is for my own personal experience with a plant based diet. I started on a plant based diet my junior year of high school because I was convinced by information on the internet that going vegan would clear my acne and relieve any other health issues that I had. To my surprise, the diet actually worked.... for about a month. After about a month or two eating nothing but lots of vegetables, fruits, beans, and experimenting with plant proteins, my health started to deteriorate. I developed bad digestive issues, my acne returned, my hormones were out of whack, and I developed reynaud's syndrome which means I felt cold all the time (especially my hands and feet). I had previously worked out a lot, but lost a lot of strength and muscle mass, and even developed anemia which I am now sure was due to a lack of quality protein. Convinced that the vegan diet was not the cause, I continued the diet for almost half a year, but was forced to stop because of how sick I felt! I finally set out to find out what was wrong with me. After almost three years worth of research and experimenting with diet, I am now very healthy and knowledgeable about what is good and what is bad.

The problem with a vegan diet is that it is a high inflammation diet with all of the grains and high poly unsaturated omega 6 vegetable oils. I had best success cutting out any foods that were high inflammation. These included wheat, most grains, some nuts, vegetable oils, and anything highly modified or processed. I eat strictly organic and minimally processed or non processed foods. My diet consists of vegetables, fruits, meats, probiotic kefir (fermented milk beverage), and gut healing foods like bone broths, glutamine, and coconut oil. I now have phenomenal digestion, have gained back lots of lean muscle mass, do not feel cold all of the time, and have cleared up my acne. My experience has taught me that the true culprits behind the health problems in the U.S. are the chemicals, antibiotics, hormones, genetic modification and processing that so much of the meat and produce are exposed to. Consumption of foods with empty calories is too much of a problem. Foods include sugary drinks, breads, starches, and candy. Again, I could write a book about all of the information that I have acquired through research and personal experience. Simply put, eat lots of living foods (fruits & vegetables), eat healthy fats, and make sure your meat is from a healthy animal. Forget about vegetable oils, highly processed foods, breads and starches, and anything that isn't nutrient rich. I guarantee that you'll feel a lot better. Do your own research and try to sift through all of the junk online. If it sounds too good to be true than it probably is. Curing all your disease by avoiding meat? Didn't work for me..",1386028800,8,4398,4.620204603580563

Per Eating, just skipping a single quarter pounder can save 3,000 gallons of fresh water since it takes 12,000 gallons of water to produce a single pound of beef when factoring in the irrigation requirements of the grain crops to feed the cattle, the amount the cattle consumes as well as contaminants with massive amounts of runoff from these factory farms as well as the water used / contaminated in processing and all stages from cradle to grave in CAFO meat production. Without subsidies to the industry meat produced via CAFO production simply would not be affordable. I was absolutely stunned how much beef is being imported into the US each year- and not just from Canada.  I was so stunned I googled it and found the facts on the USDA website.  Wow.. simply wow...

WARNING: the last 20 minutes or so is NOT for the faint of heart.... but very informative.  I watched this video during a week of practicing Vegan with 3 Raw Vegan days.  There's no way I could have consumed CAFO sourced meat with this video replaying in my head. In fact I have zero intentions of knowingly consuming meat from a factory farm ever again (traditional grocery or fast food or most franchise chains...)  Instead the bit of meat we still consume will be purchased through a supplier we trust or directly from the traditional family farm where the cattle (and chickens and pork and whatever) are always allowed to graze in fields of grasses and healthy fare in nourishing sunlight and are treated with full respect from cradle to grave. No hormones, no over-used anti-biotics, simply happy animals enjoying a relatively normal life, unlike the chickens unnaturally bulked up at just 6 weeks til farmed and cant stand without breaking their leg bones never seeing or experiencing a single ray of sunlight in their short traumatic lives. (I recently raised a small clutch of chicks from day 1 to 20 weeks, a very changing experience!)

I've watched about nine different documentaries on food and healing and all of them, even though they are focused on different issues, recommend a whole food, plant-based diet.  It's been a month since watching my first documentary on this subject and I'm slowly transforming my families diet to meals without meat and dairy.  The kids are having the hardest time with this change.  I've purchased several vegan cookbooks and have been pleasantly surprised at how good the recipes are.  We are doing the juices, too, and they aren't half bad!

Here is my list of recommended DVD documentaries if you want to get a good all-around eduction. All can be found on Netflix with the exception of ""Eating.""

Forks Over Knifes (I bought the cookbook also nd so far the recipes I've tried are delicious)
Foodmatters
A Beautiful Truth
Dying to Have Known
The Gerson Miracle
Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead
Eating
The Future of Food (disturbing about GMO's)

A few good books:
Orthomolecular Medicine For Everyone: Megavitamin Therapeutics for Families and Physicians by Abram Hoffer and Andrew W. Saul
Healing the Gerson Way: Defeating Cancer and Other Chronic Disease
The China Study: The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition Ever Conducted And the Startling Implications for Diet, Weight Loss, And Long-term Health

How am I not going to have a burger, or chicken quesadillas? ...but surprise there are so many great mock(imitation animal) products that are even better without any after taste. Morning Star prime grillers are my favorite burger, Quorn(brand) chicken diced, is good for anything with chicken; enchiladas, quesadillas, glazed chicken and pecan salads. Thank God so many people are making the products that it make changing a lot easier! If only the world knew that you don't need radiation, insulin, triple bypass surgery, or lots of medication to stabilize your life.
 I sort of knew that if you came down with an illness that water, juicing, and eating raw was your way back to health. But I ate everything because I wasn't dying yet. Also, I didn't know how bad animal product really are, or about the governments support to get us to eat our way to bad health.
Anyhow, it's awesome that they put this video together so you can teach friends and family that eating live food is the way to living!

3517557,5,B001CRQ8K6,"I have to say, this is one of the best DVD's out there in terms of getting straight to the point about the dangers inherent in the Standard American Diet (S.A.D.). What I really liked throughout watching this DVD, is the structure and way the information is presented. Mike Anderson discusses the current health woes of Western societies (and with the advent of globalisation--the world) in a very candid and easy to relate manner. Some DVD's come off as a bit on the 'preachy' side; but with Mike you get the feeling that he is making a sincere and genuine attempt to help those who have either been brainwashed by misinformation (eg that cancer, heart disease or diabetes is 'incurable'), or have simply never been exposed to the concept of a plant based diet.

By far one of the most impressive things about this DVD is how he systematically exposes the lies about the various foods we have come to accept as 'healthy' and 'essential'. For instance, this DVD planted the seed in my mind, which made me ask the following question about cows milk: 'Why are we the only animals who regularly drink the milk of another species?' Surely, mother nature in all it's wisdom, did not make us humans dependent on the milk of an animal that grows up to 750 kilos, as our most important source of calcium?  Questioning the conventional wisdom about dairy being 'healthy' because it provides calcium for strong bones, is one of the many earth shattering, conceptual changing paradigms this DVD forces you to question.

At the end of the day, most people living in Western societies are over-weight or morbidly obese. The sad truth is, that what most people have grown to accept as 'normal' weight, is in fact typically overweight.

Plenty of facts, figures and statistics are provided by this DVD (as one would expect), but what I really enjoyed are the stories about the dramatic health changes people made switching to a plant based diet (I really enjoyed listening to Dr Neil Pinckney's story, I could relate to him so well). Other topics besides health are discussed as well, like how what we eat effects climate change and the intelligence of farm animals.

Overall I found this a very important yet thoroughly enjoyable DVD to watch. It definitely serves as a great introduction for those just wanting to improve their health through a plant based diet, and want to get away from all the hoopla and charlatans that is the weight loss industry, or as further motivation for those who are already following such a path.

The information coupled with the cost of it just being a little of 6 dollars, warrants this DVD 5 Stars!",1327622400,5,2619,4.732456140350878

My wife and I, at age 70, watched this documentary and knew immediately that we had to start making some major changes in our diet.  This wasn't something we had to think about or ponder over for sometime.  At our age, if we wanted to greatly reduce our chances of acquiring the same major illnesses from which the majority of people were dieing, in greater increasing numbers every single day, we had to move on this NOW!

The sooner people view this awesome documentary and start correcting their eating habits, the sooner better health conditions can start to occur.  Some `things' that most people on this planet are totally unaware of can start to be corrected.  You'll have to watch EATING to find out what I'm talking about.  Hint:  It has to do with what is happening to the world's food and water supply.  Is that something we need to be concerned about?  Judge for yourself after watching EATING.

Universal Law:  ""If you want things to get better, you have to get better.  If you want things to change, you have to change."" Watching EATING is just the first step to making a lot of things better.

If you or someone you love suffers from any of the above or any other AUTO-IMMUNE DISEASE or chronic illness, or just have a weak immune system, you are doing your self a HUGE disservice if you do not WATCH THIS FILM!!!

I stumbled upon this video while shopping for something completely different.  I purchased it out of curiosity on a whim because it is inexpensive and the reviews are good.  I had NO IDEA I was getting the recipes to cure the auto-immune disease that plagues me and has pretty much ruined my life for the past couple of years!!  I am SO pumped!!

Man do I wish this movie were as popular as Food, Inc!!  If every American watched this and The World According to Monsanto, it would likely prevent a collapse in our economy.  This film absolutely blew me away.  I have watched a LOT of videos and have read a LOT of books about our food supply... but this one truly tops them all for me.  When it showed the details of how to cure cancer and disease, I immediately knew I would be back here to buy a copy for my dad and one of my dear friends who survived chemo-therapy (but are very sick as a result).  But when it showed the other parts toward the end?  Oh see.  I was truly riveted.  I have not come across that information in any of the other videos or books.  That was THE point of no return for me.

For the love of yourself, your child/grandchild, your husband, your pocket book, or just humanity as a whole... you can't afford NOT to watch this film.  I am here leaving a review before I literally purchase a copy for every single family member's household (all my brothers and sisters and my parents) and every friend that I care about and love.  Not kidding!  It's THAT important.  This movie (and The World According to Monsanto - available on utube) should be required viewing by every high school senior before graduation, along with the assignment of reading the book ""The Auto-immune Epidemic"".

It's less than ten dollars.  You have very little to lose and much more to gain than you can even fathom right now.  I can't recommend it highly enough.  This is truly a life-altering film.  You don't have to become a vegan or or vegetarian, but you owe it to yourself to gain this knowledge.  Knowledge is power.  And this knowledge can save your life someday, no joke!  I wish my dad had seen this before he went in for chemotherapy.  The chemo caused so much internal damage.  He has congestive heart failure today as a result, among a plethora of other ailments.  It could have all been prevented.  It's insane that the cure for cancer already exists and so few people know about it.  Why aren't the governmental agencies spreading this wonderful news?!  The video explains it all.  Again, truly a life-altering video for me.  I have two tumors in my body right now that are being monitored every 3 months in the event they turn cancerous.  I now know that I will eradicate them from my body.  I also was recently told if I didn't clean up my act I was headed toward diabetes.  It's totally amazing that diabetes can be reversed in as little as 5-7 days, two weeks for people with severe cases.  Like I said in the title:  W-O-W.  I've been suffering neurological symptoms of diabetes for a while now... and I know I don't have to anymore.  I have control over where my health goes from here.  And so do you.  WATCH THIS VIDEO!  I can't think of a person on the face of the earth in ANY situation that would regret doing so.  Not all of these are related, but still very good info to have.  God Bless!

I began shedding weight and felt more energetic. There were short term side effects that I attribute to the behavioral change and my body adjusting. But enough about me...

This film is a lot to handle for someone not initiated to the plant based diet. I would discourage anyone who is purchasing this film for the entertainment value, rather I would suggest the film 'Simply Raw' instead. 'Eating' is a full-on crash course of the major reasons as to why you should consider the plant based diet. There is no sugar coating of the material, it is served up raw and quick.

For someone like myself who is continually educating themselves on this subject, I found the film to be a five-star delicacy. But I gave this film four stars to prohibit the vegan-curious from purchasing this film and point them in the direction of buying 'Eat to Live' or 'The China Study' first. Also, the entertainment aspect could be much higher (I know, I know, I will get crud for that statement but it's true).

I have experienced several periods of ""detoxification"" (your body does this naturally as those vegetables go through you!) with accompanying low energy. This lasts maybe a day or two, then I feel much better than before.

Whereas I walked sporadically before the diet, I now walk 1-to-4 miles every day, simply because I feel better.

I became a vegetarian more than five years ago.  I feel this documentary sums up very well all the reasons why I became a vegetarian : to stop animal cruelty, to lower my ecological footprint, and to improve my health.

The first part of the documentary is dedicated to the link between eating meat and becoming sick.

On cancer, the point made in this documentary is that it will easily be held under control by a healthy immune system.  No doubt your immune system will improve if you eat a plant-based diet.  Cancer being caused by a dietary deficiency is also the core perspective of an excellent book by Edward Griffin&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/World-Without-Cancer-The-Story-of-Vitamin-B17-New-edition-revised-and-updated/dp/B001OXI7UW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">World Without Cancer: The Story of Vitamin B17 (New edition revised and updated)</a>.

However, I felt the documentary didn't really insist in eating *organic* food.  Dr. Epstein sees a clear correlation between the introduction of pesticides and the occurrence of cancer.  So you also have to take this risk into consideration.  I see no benefit in swallowing all the new fancy chemicals mankind introduced in the environment since the '40s of the last century, since our immune system never had to deal with DDT or PCB before.

What was totally new to me is that you can *completely* cure type-II-diabetes by changing the ""sad"" diet to a plant-based diet, in one week time - two weeks tops!  Wow !  This statement is convincing, since four doctors and therapists are interviewed and confirming their experiences : Dr. John McDougall, Dr. Thomas Lodi, Brenda Copp and Charlotte Gerson.

Finally, this documentary focuses on our environment and the cruel way the industrial society deals with animals.  This has an ecological impact on the whole world.  Tropical forests are cut just to make room for more animals - and the crops to feed them.  This means we can also save the environment with every bite!",1267228800,9,2224,5.339080459770115

3517593,5,B001CRQ8K6,"I was listening to the XM radio network last month when I heard golf legend Gary Player talking about what keeps him so healthy at his age. What it is that allows him to enjoy golf (and life) at his age. He suggested that all listeners buy a dvd that would ""Change your life"".

As an ER nurse, I have had many motivators to change my diet and alter my sedentary lifestyle. Something about watching people die of mostly avoidable problems does ""motivate"". I bought an eye opening dvd a few weeks back, simply titled, ""Eating"". Under ten bucks on Amazon. It forced me to evaluate my diet in a big way.

I am leaning towards being a vegetarian M-F and eating meats, dairy, and cheese on weekends only. Cut back to 1,500 calories and lost weight in the two weeks since starting my diet. I am 6'6"" 304.7 lbs. Well, I was that two weeks ago. Yesterday I weighed 289.6 lbs. My goal is 250 lbs. Just as importantly, I am not starving myself to loose this weight. I am eating good. If you watch the dvd, things will be very clear.

Namely, the role an increasing amount of calories from animal fats plays on our health. Especially as it pertains to cardiovascular disease and stroke. Diabetes type II of course is an issue for many. These conditions have grown at exponential rates in our country and our diet is the main reason. Asians have very little heart disease, stroke, or osteoporosis. However, Asians in the US that adopt our lifestyle (and diet) have the same problems we do. It is all about what we eat. Hippocrates said, ""Our best doctor is inside us"", referring to the old adage, ""You are what you eat"". Be open minded enough to watch the dvd if you want to be leaner, healthier, and increase longevity.

If you think eating more chicken and fish is the answer, you are exactly as stupid as me. Turns out, chicken has nearly the same cholesterol as beef. Shrimp has some 5-6x the amount of cholesterol as beef. ****, I hated learning that one. The cholesterol in eggs and cheese makes them bad of course. So we go through life eating all these animal fats and the ulitmate irony takes place. They kill us. That is right, the animals we eat get their revenge. Albeit a few decades later. Sobering if you think about it. Although I suspect a good many of you are laughing. I understand more than you can appreciate.

I am not a tree hugger or some liberal do gooder. I am more of a redneck type myself. Fishing, Harley Davidson riding, beer drinking, etc.. I also love meat, grilling steaks, etc.. Got a smoker a few months back in fact. I love eating God's creatures, always will. But what I recently learned has me ready to adopt a diet that consist more largely on plant based intake, and less heavily on calories from animal fats. In eating vegetarian (more or less) M-F, I will be cutting my animal fat calories by 70%. This is a compromise I am willing to make in order to live a longer and more fruitful life. I can still kick back a few beers and grill the steaks on weekends. Just won't be eating it everyday. I got three great vegetarian recipe books from Amazon yesterday. Tons of ideas and information on how to reduce calories from animal fats. Good looking stuff too. I am eager to try some recipes out actually. Consider buying a few books to give you ideas on a ""new"" way to eat.

Watch the dvd if you want to find out how a redneck turns vegan. Ha ha... Seriously, buy the dvd. If nothing else, this type of change will be a great way to lose weight in the short term. My goals were short and long term. Loosing weight now and fast. Also, interested in being healthier down the road. At 36 years old, now is the time for me to think about it. Not after the first stent is placed. Not after the back surgery. Not after I get put on insulin.

Food for thought guys. Food with less animal fat calories that is. Ha ha...",1265587200,9,3835,4.3552447552447555

3517596,5,B001CRQ8K6,"This DVD, like others by Mike Anderson, goes right to the heart of all the health problems plaguing Americans and the rest of the world, where ever plant based foods have been abandoned in favor of ""modern and tasty"" diets.

Unfortunately the problem stems from the food guidelines set forth by the USDA itself.  The people setting the dietary requirements are the very people who want to sell their dairy products, meat products and other animal based products.  Hence, the USDA dietary guidelines are baseless.  This has been fully corroborated by my own failures at restoring health despite strictly adhering to the USDA requirements.  However, after I switched to a plant based diet, my recovery and detoxification were very rapid.

After 20+ yrs of acute symptoms of various sorts, without a conclusive diagnosis from any physician, I was finally healed through detoxification and a plant based diet.  I know I'll be on a plant based diet for the rest of my lifetime.  In fact, I plan on growing my own leafy greens when I move into a house.  In the meantime I'll put in a container garden in the balcony of my apartment.

The results in my improved health speak for themself.  I had high and unstable BP, chronic and acute insomnia, acute sciatica, difficulty breathing, tiredness, chronic diarhea, joint pains and stiffness, edema etc.  However, after becoming a vegan and doing juicing and raw food living, all of my symptoms have simply vanished.

One has to make the changes and stay with them to see the incredible results.  Mike Anderson has done for the cause of health and elimination of cruelty to animals, what the saints have done to bring God's love into this world.  Mike's work is going to serve like the beacon from a lighthouse to all those seeking refuge from the barrage of misinformation presented by the food and drug industry, the govt agencies (USDA and FDA), the physicians and the health insurance quagmire.

The DVD below is is an excellent DVD.  One must watch the bonus feature  titled --  The Gerson Therapy: A director's Perspective.  It has several convincing case histories based upon the healing power of alternate approaches using the plant based diet.  The case histories in the bonus feature alone are worth the price of the DVD.

Modern medicine, the agribusiness, health insurance and the govt regulatory agencies have all gone comepletely astray.  They are all sending us to an early grave.  It is for us to wade through the morass of misinformation to arrive at the correct path of covalescing through proper nutrition.  One cannot depend on any of the above sources.

Steve Meyerowitz's books on sprouting, wheatgrass, raw foods, juicing and his other titles are also chock full of ""how to"" implement the plant based lifestyle.  He got it right!

If one detoxifies through a plant based diet, and takes to yoga, I can guarantee that such a person will never fall ill or need medical coverage.

This Eating DVD by Mike Anderson is a must watch.  I know I'll be buying many more to give to everyone so as to save them from a lifetime of disability and poor health.  Mike is right!",1263427200,24,3667,5.407407407407407
3517597,1,B001CRQ8K6,"While I do agree with the fact that, diet affects your health and that changing your diet can cure nearly all the modern ailments, I disagree that the only way is to become a vegetarian.  Many people have been cured of the same diseases by changing the KIND of meats and animal products they are eating.  They also gave up nearly all processed and refined foods and were treated by a chiropractor. (Check out the work of Dr. Mercola or Dr. Pompa)
The animal products produced by the modern factory farm is indeed very bad for you, but animals raised on a diet that they would have consumed in the wild 100 years ago, no pesticides, GMO's, vaccines, or drugs, and little to no grain (at least not in large quantities and absent from the stalks) do not cause the health problems that the author of this DVD attributes to all animals.

For a good example of this, check out the Inuit, 300 years ago.  Their diet was 90% animal based in the 2 month summer and 100% animal based in the winter.  They thrived and had long life spans, unlike the average city dweller of the time.  Many people see old photos of the Inuit and comment on how unhealthy and decrepit the people look.  Many people fail to recall that long before the camera, the white man was giving the Inuit white flour and white sugar in large quantities.  A diet like that will kill anyone, and it would not matter if they cut out all animal products.

Another point of disagreement is that farm animals are a major cause of global warming.  The sun is the cause of global warming (Sun spots and cosmic rays together).  The climate has always changed.  There were many instances in the past where the temperatures were far warmer than today, and I am talking the resent past.  One need only look into the history of life during the Medieval Warm Spell.  Around 1000 AD, England had many vineyards, Greenland was farmed by the Vikings, Leif Erickson found grapes in Newfoundland.  The world was far warmer 1000 years ago that it is today.  The ice caps no doubt melted some, yet the polar bears survived, the seals survived, the earth survived.  There were no cars or factories, a low human population and a huge animal population.  Some 60 million buffalo roamed North America and herds of unfathomable sizes roamed Africa.  Obviously, cows and pigs are not causing global warming.  Watch the DVD ""The great global warming swindle"" to see an alternative view and one that makes more sense than the one presented in this DVD.

3517602,3,B001CRQ8K6,"I watched this DVD and then tried this diet for 8 days.
Tonight I threw in the towel with a can of smoked
herring and a toasted muffin drenched in butter.
Almost immediately, I felt 100% more alive.

Lest you think I'm kidding, I'm not.  For eight days
I followed this diet without execeptions.  No packaged
or prepared or baked foods of any kind. No oil. No
dairy or animal products of any kind.  As a retiree I
had the time and interest to give this a try. As a person
who doesn't go to doctors or take any medications except
for anti-biotics for infection, Mike was preaching to
the choir with me in it.

Here's everything I ate in the last eight days (with a lot
of cooking by my wife):
home made lentils with carrots, home made brown rice,
avocados, raw cashews, zucchini stewed in plain tomato sauce,
steamed string beans, plain beets canned in water, Kalamata
olives, mushrooms baked with soy sauce, fresh home grown tomatoes,
salads made with lettuce, onion, cucumber, tomato and sprouts,
seasoned with plain rice wine vinegar, fresh fruit including
grapes, strawberries and clementines, black coffee
sweetened with honey, plain seltzer with fresh squeezed
lime juice, a couple of glasses of red wine and one bottle
of micro brew ale per day. Gardening and walking supplied
the exercise.

Because I avoid soy protein or soy milk products (due to a
prickly heat reaction), it was tough getting enough protein on
this diet from just the lentils, raw cashews and brown
rice. I wasn't able to down more than 1-1/2 to 2 cups of lentils
a day, and therefore only got a total of 1/2 to 2/3 of my required
80 grams of protein per day.  If I was eating a raw food diet like
many of the speakers in the video (I googled everyone with a name
identified in the video, and many of them are raw food vegans),
I don't think I could have gotten more than 1/3 of my daily
protein requirement.

I wanted this diet to work but in 8 days my blood pressure was
actually a few points higher than my normal 160/85, and my weight
at 219-1/2 was just a half pound less.  I did move my bowels 3 or
4 times a day (like Mike said), but I'm not sure that's always
a benefit. This diet was interesting and platable but not really
enjoyable. And by today, I was really feeling somewhat washed out.

Granted that eating this way may significantly improve the
odds against my getting cancer and heart disease.  But at 62,
I feel my life's been too short already for me to give up the
foods I really enjoy every day, like meat, fish, butter, eggs,
whole milk and cheese. I do agree with Mike about the cruelty
to calves bred for veal, and haven't touched veal in 25 years.",1250640000,14,2646,4.423868312757202

I can't imagine the type of people who actually need to hear this gospel would have the interest to. My father suffers from high cholesterol and because the doctor says eat less meat, as opposed to stop eating meat, he wouldn't sit through it. Yes, it's preachy and people don't want to hear that they have to really change their entire lives in order to have a life worth living.

Some of the testimonials were over the top and I agree with some other posters here, it felt like an infomercial at times, but it made me feel inspired to continue eating a plant based diet.

3517607,2,B001CRQ8K6,"This is an interesting concept, but... I have a few issues with the movie:

1. Too often it sounds like an infomercial, almost irritating. Perhaps, this was unintentional and plain clumsy, but it's there and hard to ignore.

2. Bundling a potentially revolutionary concept with a dubious one called ""global warming"" (even flashing pics of Al Gore and stills from his movie). I don't want to get into the whole global warming politics here, but the bottom line is - the two should have never been mixed together.

3. Plenty of catchy quotes throughout the movie, but very few meaningful scientific references. To fully benefit from the info presented, you need to go to the website (url in the movie) which provides tons of references. It would take months if not years to read all of them trying to verify all or most of the claims in the movie.

4. Spectacular claims, such as substantial reductions in blood cholesterol levels over amazingly short periods of time, just by switching to non-animal diet. Similar claims regarding spontaneous remissions of advanced cancers etc. Again, no solid, unbiased data from clinical research to support these, no imaging or laboratory evidence from the patients who allegedly recovered or substantially improved.

5. There are constant undertones of conspiracy by big pharma, big food industry, lobbies etc. No matter how real these are, their role seems to be overstated.

6. Towards the end of the movie, there is a short segment that is a fairly typical PETA propaganda. Just like with misplaced global warming, why inject something like this into the movie that is supposed to explain the health benefits of a certain diet? It would have been better to simply state a point in question, as clearly as possible, and document it with some compelling scientific data, instead of spicing it up with junk science and junk politics.

Even with all the described flaws, for some this may be a worthwhile info. Kinda elementary school or junior high level. If, however, in this day and age you still need someone to tell you that diets heavily based on animal products are not healthy, you probably don't need a movie like this one to begin with. Food can be a dangerous addiction, a lot more complex than just a simple matter of choices. It is a reflection of many layers of a society and should be addressed accordingly. This movie takes an important step in scratching the surface of the problem, but does it in a very awkward and at times misguided way.",1241222400,28,2493,4.8243559718969555

It deserves more than 5 stars because it is a real public service.  And unlike others who've made good films on the health benefits of the vegan diet, Mike Anderson charges a very reasonable price.
