5994143,5,B00FJYXPCW,"""Casper's Halloween"" is an average special for Hanna-Barbera as a special that aired around the same time as H-B's cheesy ""Casper and the Angels"" TV series (still not released to DVD).

The draw for this DVD is the bonus special of ""The Thanksgiving That Almost Wasn't"", a rare 1972 H-B special that seems to be a training ground for the upcoming H-B theatrical feature ""Charlotte's Web"" as it is more realistic and fluid than most anything else H-B had produced up to this time.

Highly recommended for that reason alone.",1417651200,5,522,4.788888888888889

8616212,5,B00FJYXPCW,"This is just the way I remember watching it as a kid who grew up in the 1980's. I bought this for my 2 year old to watch, and she adores it as much as I did growing up. Plus it puts you in mood for Halloween, and gets you excited for trick or treating. The songs are adorable and catchy, and the storyline is sweet. I got it out of Halloween box yesterday and we have watched it 15 times all together the past 2 days! Really sweet and adorable! This is 5 stars in my book! My daughter dances or marches in front of tv when songs come on. We also love the Great pumpkin Charlie Brown,  Garfield's Halloween, and Disney's Ichabod Crane. Also, not on DVD, but grew up watching in the 80's Disney's Halloween Treat special, wish that would be released on DVD someday. If you love those classics you will love this Casper Halloween special!",1474848000,,835,4.21875
8616213,5,B00FJYXPCW,"Happy Halloween and Thanksgiving, everybody! Despite its high price tag, these 2 Hanna-Barbera holiday classics are worth having in your collection, especially if you're a fan of Hanna-Barbera! Casper's Halloween Special from 1979 was also called by 2 other names; Casper Saves Halloween or He Ain't Scary, He's Our Brother! It was also the pilot episode of another H-B/Harveytoons collaboration, as a whole series, only with the orphans' names being different here than in the series! Just 2 months later, Casper and Hairy Scary are teamed up with Yogi Bear and his gang in Casper's First Christmas, which is in another Warner Archive DVD release entirely! The bonus special is Hanna-Barbera's answer to Rankin/Bass' Mouse on the Mayflower; The Thanksgiving That Almost Wasn't! Both specials are great at showing the first Thanksgiving in each company's own special ways, too bad Mouse on the Mayflower ain't on DVD at all, except maybe from bootleggers. At any rate, The Thanksgiving That Almost Wasn't was a precursor to Charlotte's Web for Paramount, showing more realistic humans and animals, and more animation fluidity than anything else Hanna-Barbera made up till the early 70's, when both classics were made! Just watch and learn that the first Thanksgiving, or any other, is no easy task! So what if Hanna-Barbera reused music from Scooby Doo for this special; like with Filmation, Hanna-Barbera also reused old footage all the time to save their necks and butts from going bankrupt, or belly-up as my family puts it; that's also true with many of the Hanna-Barbera Christmas specials on DVD so far! If you appreciate what the Pilgrims and Hanna-Barbera did to make Thanksgiving what it is today, as Casper did for Halloween and Hanna-Barbera, go ahead and add this short-but-great Warner Archive DVD to your holiday home video collections today!",1473292800,2,1856,5.1694352159468435
8616214,5,B00FJYXPCW,Love Everything about it .... just like my childhood! We watch it every Christmas ..... always take me back to the early 80's!,1453766400,,126,4.521739130434782
8616215,1,B00FJYXPCW,ASPER'S HALLOWEEN SPECIAL is very boring the songs are repetitive and the plot is stupid even for a children's special I donated CASPER'S HALLOWEEN SPECIAL and MAD MAD MAD MONSTERS to a neighbor with a 7 children.,1446336000,,213,4.783783783783784
8616216,4,B00FJYXPCW,"Casper was a childhood favorite cartoon of mine. As I sat down to watch this collection, memories of simple storylines and the sweet voice of the poprtly Casper (Cecil H. Roy). The animation manages to remain quite gothic and rich in its tones. The collection will keep you going and the memories come forth. What I liked most about the earliest episodes were the lessons that casper learned. The Ghostly Trio, Wendy, and Hot Stuff are all here.",1427846400,,445,4.717948717948718

8616218,3,B00FJYXPCW,"Not the best cartoon special.  I usually like the older specials but this one has an outdated feel to it. Also, Casper has a really irritating voice.  I know it sounds petty but it bothers you as you're trying to watch.  It sounds like an adult talking in a really babyish voice and like I said, I'm a fan of the older specials and haven't found this a problem in the other ones.  My daughter didn't even want to sit through to the end because she wasn't enjoying it.",1417996800,,467,4.213483146067416
