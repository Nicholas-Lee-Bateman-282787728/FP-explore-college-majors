5198660,5,B008ZRKIMK,"What a great surprise! I stumbled upon this movie by mistake, started watching and couldn't stop. I didn't know it starred Brian Bosworth, whom I had little respect for in the past because of his arrogance. Watching both parts, 1 & 2, I was amazed. What a GREAT story line and production. It was extremely satisfying to see a movie that had a Christian influence yet told a gripping story that all should be able to relate to somehow. I have since read of Brian's conversion to Christianity and am so happy about that as well. This movie, parts one and two, are well worth your time and should be watched by church youth groups, single groups and all who love a GREAT action movie!!",1394496000,,682,4.464
5198661,4,B008ZRKIMK,Here's a very good & gripping drama with a strong faith message. The picture quality is excellent & the casting is very good!,1392940800,,125,4.478260869565218
5198662,1,B008ZRKIMK,"I just watched this movie and was entertained by its cornball, hokey story-line, and obvious attempt by the writers and producers to sell their religion.  Only non-thinking, believers would buy this piece of ridiculous propaganda. But then, Hollywood has always made big money on selling and re-hashing Biblical fairy-tales. You don't do yourself or family any favors by teaching this myth to the gullible and misguided. If you realize this is 100% fiction (and only half the story), then you can just sit back and enjoy the movie...",1370908800,3,533,5.056818181818182
5198663,1,B008ZRKIMK,The story was disconnected and we could not figure out where it was going.  There was way too much violence and for what?  Then all of a sudden it was to be continued.  Your advertising did not show that it was the first episode.  It was a total MESS and a waste of money and time.,1367712000,3,281,3.9642857142857144
5198664,5,B008ZRKIMK,"We really enjoyed the movie. When is part two coming out.

5198666,5,B008ZRKIMK,"Wherever you are on the spectrum, an adherent to a specific organized religion, simply spiritual or a skeptic with a sole perspective toward scientific reason, you'll find that this movie adds a welcome diversity to the pool of Hollywood productions.  The world watches and enjoys religious/spiritual/moral themes in movies, from Denzel Washington in ""Malcolm X"" portraying a journey toward more religious inclusiveness to Keanu Reeves in ""The Devil's Advocate"" and ""Constantine"" where  he fights and overcomes the devil and demons.  Along these lines this movie is similar, however, it departs from the negative norm and introduces themes of universal hope common to everyone. A hope that one can overcome those that initiate violence, that one can find love in marriage and children, that there are strangers that care and are willing to share a meal or lend an ear.  Even though this film uses strong western Judeo-Christian beliefs and language it is truly an enjoyable watch that starkly contrasts our calculating postmodern world with its focus on political agendas, war, and corporate cost benefit analysis.  Grab a ""Cup of Joe"", kick back and enjoy a great action flick that not only speeds up your heart but moves it as well.  Enjoy!",1364169600,,1242,5.154228855721393

5198669,1,B008ZRKIMK,"NOT 3D!  Under the description in the format section, this movie is listed as 3D. It is not 3D. It is 2D.

This is essentially a Christian recruitment film. I don't particularly mind that at all, despite not being religious myself, but the production values are fairly low. Not a very well-made movie. Sort of fun in a low-budget action film way, but not worth spending money on, in my opinion.",1435708800,,394,4.535211267605634
