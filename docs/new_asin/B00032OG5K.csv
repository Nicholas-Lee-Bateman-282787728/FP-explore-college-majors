2155917,5,B00032OG5K,"This DVD is one of the best I have purchased on the subject of OIGong the presentation is good but, could be a little better.

Why do I give this my outstanding approval is because it works!

I have had a chronic problem with bursitis the problem was so bad that it would wake me up during a sound sleep.  I have had injections and medication (celebrex)  to help with the problem.

After using QIGong for about a week I have had no pain what so ever, I was able to discontinued the medication

There are other QIGong instructions out there, and I have tried several however, I find this to work the best.",1106524800,32,604,4.254385964912281
8035920,5,B00032OG5K,Dr. Love saved my life   He and his teachings are amazing!!! It's an honor to give a five star rating!! Thank you!,1523318400,,114,4.136363636363637
8035921,5,B00032OG5K,"The daily routine takes 1/2 hour, but first you will want to preview each exercise to understand the purpose of each one.  I do this daily and once a week I watch the exercise explanations to help me remember the details of each one.",1500336000,,233,4.295454545454546
8035922,4,B00032OG5K,"I enjoyed this video and used it to facilitate instructions to others in a group setting.  I appreciated the simple explanations of  where the meridians started and ended, as well as the benefits derived from performing each exercise.  The woman in the video behaved in  a manner that mitigated the professionalism of the teachings.",1444176000,,332,5.092592592592593
8035923,5,B00032OG5K,"Several years ago I found Dr. Love on YouTube.  His teaching technique is easy to follow and understand.  He may appear somewhat unconventional, but then to the average American Qigong is unconventional.  This is a wonderful teaching DVD that is clear, concise and easy to learn from.  As a Doctor of Medical Qigong myself I can highly recommend it.  The only drawback is the lack of a menu.  This is easily overcome by noting the time that the actual forms begin and starting from there once you have watched it from the beginning.  There are over 5000 different Qigong forms and too many lineages to count.  Normally I am a Shaolin Qigong purist, but make an exception for Dr. Love as I find him to be an excellent teacher.",1415923200,2,725,4.565891472868217
8035924,5,B00032OG5K,Dr. Loves DVD is very easy to follow. He goes through each exercise step by step showing important things you need to know to properly perform moves for maximum meridian stimulation. He uses an assistant to do this. Then after everything is explained he does the 14 exercises himself on the beach.,1405900800,,297,4.730769230769231
8035925,1,B00032OG5K,I am sorry that I purchased this product.  As a Qigong Teacher I was interested in how other teachers viewed the use of the internal and external energy gates and meridians.  This product has many medical as well as practical inaccuracies and does not focus on the energies use of meridians.  I would not recommend this product.,1211414400,8,328,4.719298245614035
8035926,5,B00032OG5K,"I will state up front that my review is biased, as I have had the good fortune to be a student of Dr. George Love's for over 6 years. He was my first qigong teacher, and often teaches early in the morning on the beach here in Boca Raton, where part of this DVD was filmed.

The Meridian Qigong form presented on this DVD consists of 14 exercises that stretch and help open all the major acupuncture meridians and channels. The exercises are linked by deep breathing and circulation of energy through the microcosmic orbit. The first section covers important basic information on qi, qigong, breathing, stances, etc. The second and longest section provides detailed instructions and pointers on each of the exercises. It's really like attending one of his workshops. The third section is an uninterrupted practice-along presentation of the form. It takes about 35-40 minutes to complete the form. I agree with the reviewer who stated that the DVD would benefit from a menu, as it would speed getting to this section.

Meridian qigong would be classified as a medical qigong form, and is of Taoist origin. Dr. Love learned the form over 20 years ago from his teacher, Master B.Y. Li, who later named him as a successor. Since my initial studies with Dr. Love, I have also attended workshops with a variety of other qigong teachers, some nationally known, and completed a 2 year medical qigong training course at an acupuncture school. Although the form on this DVD was the first one I learned, I still consider it to be my favorite.",1210118400,10,1530,4.7481203007518795
8035927,5,B00032OG5K,This DVD does just what it says. Great information for both beginners and seasoned practitioners. Very clear and well presented.,1200096000,2,128,5.45
8035928,3,B00032OG5K,I gave this as a gift to a friend and she said it was very hard for her to follow as a beginner. That is had great information but she wished it had shown more from the side view so she could have seen better.,1167782400,8,209,3.6666666666666665
8035929,5,B00032OG5K,"As a teacher of Chinese internal martial arts, I look for content quality in a DVD of this nature. Here, I was not disappointed. Dr. Love presents an excellent course on meridian qigong in an informative and friendly manner. In fact, it's probably one of the best videos on the subject I have seen.

I am also a video editor and DVD author. Here is where I give the DVD about a 3. It needs a menu, desperately!!! The content is wonderful and I can't believe they didn't give it a menu. You can go Next many times to get where you'd like to go, but that is tedious and time consuming.  A menu would have made this a 6 on a level of 1 to 5. I would say that is inexcusable for a professional DVD today.

But, I think the content is well worth it and I overlooked the irritation with the navigation, or lack thereof.

Excellent job Dr. Love! Thank you.",1156291200,20,849,4.158536585365853
