Greatly pleased by this movie; Cronenberg does a cameo and possibly advice-has the tone and skewed humor of his stuff. What some may call disgusting might be viewed as inner-city realism by others. Why do the best indies come out of Canada? They seem to have a vampire industry up there...if you can, get this movie!",1204588800,6,384,4.731343283582089
8324243,5,B0007Z1JFS,"this is the best vampire related movie I'VE seen(although i'm NOT usually a fan of vampire films post 1968)since ""The Fearless Vampire Killers""... it's kinda like a gritty mid-eighties NY indy comedy/fright-flic with a bit of the afore-mentioned movies' tongue-in-cheek sense of humor & seudo-drama... it's kinda like if the mobile-home in ""Near Dark"" got smashed on the tracks of the train in ""Martin""... of coarse, i might be alone in thinking that would be funny... I KNOW!!! if you like ""Blood For Dracula"", you'll LOVE this film... so if this gets a proper release, you won't be wasting money if you try/buy this one... a true classic!!!
 PLUS, David Cronenberg backed the film as a producer if that turns your knob...",1186358400,10,723,4.926229508196721
