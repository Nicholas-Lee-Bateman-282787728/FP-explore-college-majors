8403405,5,B001M2IXC2,"These transcriptions are creative, challenging, fun to play, and the songs sound great.  Best of all, the songs are really composed pieces -- they're not just a verse/chorus with variations.  The level of complexity is comparable to classical music, but with the soul, sound and feel of popular music in solo guitar arrangements.  His demeanor and playing are rather expressionless, but that's fine for teaching and gives you the opportunity to add in all the personality yourself.  Highly recommended for the intermediate to advanced fingerstyle player.",1384041600,2,554,5.406976744186046
