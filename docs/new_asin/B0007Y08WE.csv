2250774,5,B0007Y08WE,I would tell anyone who has kids from 1 on up to buy these dvd's  They are great for kids I have a 22 month old  great grandson that has watched them on noggin for the last 8 months and I just brought him the 4 dvd's that I found to buy I would love it if they would come out with a box set of all the episodes. It is well worth the money,1141776000,11,338,3.493333333333333
2250775,5,B0007Y08WE,My son and I adore this and all the Little Bear dvd's. I can see myself watching them the rest of my life.,1125014400,10,106,3.652173913043478
2250776,5,B0007Y08WE,"I have been waiting for this set about music to come out on DVD, and I am happy that the bonus episodes they added do not include any of the scarier Little Bear stories.  Not that Little Bear is at all frightening for the kindergarten crowd, but my preschooler does not need to be introduced to new fears (like the wind with a spooky face in ""Good Night Little Bear').

This DVD contains 12 episodes that play on a loop, 4 about music, 4 about kisses, and 4 about friendship.  There is one almost irritating story where Chicken squawks a lot (it's actually pretty funny) and one particularly endearing story where Mother Bear kisses a skunk and he is overwhelmed with joy that someone would kiss his smelly self.  They are all happy and sweet and my 3 year old loves them, but I was surprised when a friend's 8 and 10 year olds came over the other day exclaimed over the DVD, ""Little Bear!  He's great!""

All in all, highly recommended.",1122422400,53,936,4.412790697674419

2250778,5,B0007Y08WE,The Little Bear series is a favorite of my 5 year old daughter. It isn't hard edged like the stupid prime time cartoons that seem to be in vogue. These are fun to watch and give my daughter great enjoyment.,1406073600,,206,4.175

2250785,1,B0007Y08WE,"The DVD is such poor quality, we can't even view Little Bear. Straight out of the package-- it skips and get stuck on the commercials the second we put it in the DVD player. We've tried for over 2 hours to get to the Little Bear menu, but the DVD is no good. Too much money for something that doesn't work. Our DVD player is new and plays other DVD's just fine, just not this one (it may possibly be a burned DVD, which is why my player can't read it.) Cheap product. I contacted the seller about this issue, and never heard back.",1388966400,,530,4.105769230769231

2250790,5,B0007Y08WE,"my 22 mo old is obsessed with little bear and we bought this DVD for long car trips and it is great.  she loves it and i would recommend little bear to any mom...it is generally a nice calm, non irritating cartoon.  there are a few episodes that are a little scary, but none of them are on this DVD",1267142400,,298,3.95
2250791,5,B0007Y08WE,Little Bear DVD's are the next best thing to reading a story to a child...sometimes you just don't have the time.  Little Bear is there to buy you some peace and quiet and entertain any preschooler with simple story lines.,1265414400,,222,4.55

We have 5 kids ages 15 down to 2 and they all enjoy Little Bear's gentle stories.",1255910400,34,552,4.585858585858586
2250794,5,B0007Y08WE,My daughter is 22 months old and is a huge fan of Little Bear.  We traveled 10 hours in the car to NC and she watched Little Bears Band and Little Bears Rainy Day Tails for 10 hours straight.  I believe there are 12 episodes on each disc and they are very relaxing!,1254700800,,265,3.981132075471698
2250795,5,B0007Y08WE,"My son turned 15 August 22.  As a toddler his favorite show was Little Bear.  He would sing ""Little Bear, Little Bear Sing a Song"" all day.  It seemed, at the time, to be his favorite episode.  A tradition in our family is for the birthday person to choose a restaurant for the birthday dinner.  After dinner the family gathered round the tv. I had setup the dvd to start right when the song comes on. The expression on my son's face was priceless.  I could tell that he was filled with emotion and he was overwhelmed with the memories of his early years.  After watching Little Bear we continued talking about the past and how much ""fun things were when you don't have to deal with the drama and stress of high school life.""  Little Bear is a treasure for my son but that evening it became a treasure for us all.",1254268800,6,813,4.26797385620915
2250796,5,B0007Y08WE,"You can get a sense of how awesome the Little Bear videos are from the fact that they almost never come up for sale used much cheaper than the new ones, here or on ebay. I've been combing the internet for used Little Bears, and they are like gold, for good reason!

If you are tired of shows that are loud and fast-paced, or tired of commercials on tv, and just want wholesome, engaging, fairly low-key entertainment for your child, Little Bear is IT! Another reviewer recommended renting first to find out which ones your family likes best, and I heartily agree.

That said, once you start buying Little Bear videos, it's hard to stop! This one was initially not one of our (me and my daughter, now age 2 1/2) favorites, but we just re-rented it from the library after not seeing it in a while, and it really grew on us. The clincher was that after watching the Valentine episode, while I was making dinner, my daughter spontaneously made me her first ever Valentine, then came into the kitchen to surprise me with it, saying, ""Happy Birthday Valentine's Day, Mommy!"" Way to go, Little Bear! ;-)

I am really surprised at how often my daughter is thinking about Little Bear plots and characters even when she's not watching it. We'll be driving somewhere, and she'll start talking about an episode, asking what happened with a certain character after the episode ended, etc. If that's not one sign of quality children's tv programming, I don't know what is! I also like that the characters all tend to treat each other with love and respect, so I don't have any worries about my daughter repeating words or actions she learns on Little Bear.

In addition, I really love how Little Bear has adventures using just his imagination and occasionally some simple household props. So many tv shows make you feel like you have to buy ""stuff"" to have fun. Not Little Bear! He can make a mountain out of a blanket, or a doll out of a scrap of old cloth, or a space helmet out of a box, and before you know it, he's off on an exciting adventure with his animal friends. I also appreciate that nontraditional families are shown: LB's friend Emily lives with her grandmother, and for some episodes, LB's father is ""away,"" so it's just him and Mama Bear. I think it's good for children to grow up sensitive to and appreciative of all types of families. It's also neat that despite being an only child, er, bear, Little Bear is never bored, and always finds ways to create his own entertainment.

We will probably end up buying all the Little Bear DVDs, just to have a good variety to choose them. I hope my daughter likes them for a long time, because I like them too! They are cozy and sweet, and seem to embody everything that's good about children's tv. Two thumbs up, way up!",1254096000,,2766,4.50199203187251
2250797,5,B0007Y08WE,This has to be our favourite Little Bear's DVD!! The stories are lovely (and some very funny) and the songs are wonderful!! Love it!,1218931200,,132,4.541666666666667
2250798,5,B0007Y08WE,"If the little ones in your life love Little Bear, than this DVD is great. Runs long enough to get some things done, or to set settle down before afternoon naps.",1207526400,,160,4.193548387096774
2250799,5,B0007Y08WE,"My 2 1/2 yr old twins love little bear! They watch this DVD about 2x per week while I clean house. After it is over they always say ""another bear mommy"", they want to see it it again.",1206489600,,183,3.8421052631578947
2250800,4,B0007Y08WE,"If you are looking for good cartoons for very young children to watch, the ""Little Bear"" series is an excellent choice.  These videos are nonviolent, reasonably engaging and intelligent, and they generally teach good values and problem solving.  It's not great art, but it is entertaining and won't insult your child's intelligence.  Based on a series of books written by Else Homelund Minarik in the 1960s, this is good family fare -- you can park your kid in front of these films and not have to worry about disturbing or inappropriate content.  Whew!  Thank goodness.

The episodes are short and each disc has quite a lot of content on them... a lot of bang for your buck.  These have been big hits around our household. (ReadThatAgain)",1187913600,,739,4.817460317460317
2250801,3,B0007Y08WE,"My 2.5yr-old daughter loves to watch Little Bear on TV and usually cries when it's over, so I knew it was time to buy one of the DVD's.  We rented&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Bear-Rainy-Day-Tales/dp/B0007Y08W4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Bear - Rainy Day Tales</a>, Little Bear's Band, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Little-Bear-Movie/dp/B00008V2TW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Little Bear Movie</a>&nbsp;before deciding to buy Rainy Day Tales.  I give this one 3 stars because it's true, my daughter loved it.  I didn't give it 4 or 5 stars, though, because as an adult some things annoyed me.  Three of the episodes make up a 3-part story about a skunk looking for love, and I didn't like his character as much as the regulars - he's kind of weird and spacey.  Also, my daughter would lose interest during these episodes - I think the content was not so interesting to her.  The episode ""Diva Hen"", while admittedly very funny, got on my nerves after awhile, with Hen squawking opera for most of it.  Both my daughter and I just enjoyed Rainy Day Tales better - I recommend renting each ahead of time if you can, before purchasing - it really helped us decide.

(We also rented&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Bear-Feel-Better-Little-Bear/dp/B0000AQS8N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Bear - Feel Better Little Bear</a>&nbsp;but it stopped after one episode, so I had to select an episode and push PLAY for each episode - kind of defeated the purpose for a mom trying to get things done.  I don't know if it was just that one dvd, though, or if they're all like that.  We did like the episodes we saw, but it was too much hassle.)",1183334400,16,1798,5.802281368821292

Little Bear and friends learn the basics of life and social adjustment... without being drummed into an overt moral message.

Best of all, the music, character temperaments, and overall themes are presented in a relaxed, even-tempered manner.  Except for Duck's wackiness and Owl's aloofness, you can rest assured that Little Bear and friends are the types of friends you want Little Johnny befriending.

As an added bonus: our daughter often falls asleep while watching the DVD (either in the TV room or in the SUV).",1174867200,2,671,5.018018018018018
