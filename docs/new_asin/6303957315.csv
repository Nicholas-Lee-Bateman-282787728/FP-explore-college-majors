748683,5,6303957315,"Greetings from Tromaville!
A couple are in a legal battle over palimony, and a judge/angel Gabrial (Professor Irwin Correy)helps them resolve their problems by taking them through a tour of historical disfunctional couples.
This brilliant satire is very well done and contains the first rapping rabbis! It also contains more laughter and foxy ladies than your average Troma film, plus a little gore for you gorehounds out there!
A must buy! Fans should seek out Lloyd Kaufman's ""The First Turn-On"", ""Squeeze Play!"" and Mick Napier's ""Fatty Drives The Bus!""

I watched 5 minutes and saw it was an amateurish attempt at something humorously sexual, but with lame humor and nothing you would think was attractively sexual.

748821,5,6303957315,Great 80's film. Funny and randy at the same time. I highly recommend for those in love with the 80's.,1385424000,,102,4.15

748940,1,6303957315,Worst movie ever. Horrible acting and just plain weird. I so would not reccommend this movie one bit. Keep looking.,1356307200,,115,4.8
748941,1,6303957315,This movie gives you the idea that there will be plenty of sex or sexy women is a joke.  The humor is slap-stick one liners and goofy-more for younger kids?  Would not recommend this movie to anyone,1355875200,2,198,4.324324324324325
748942,1,6303957315,"I normally like Troma films, they are a bit of a guilty pleasure. Silly, funny, lots of gratuitous T&A. This one seems to be an exception. I found it silly . . . but nothing else. I found myself wondering how someone actually purposely made each scene and then found themselves happy with them. If you are a huge fan of the silliness normally associated with Troma films, you'll like this one. If you are looking for other things in addition, don't bother.",1350950400,,456,4.506024096385542
748943,1,6303957315,"Just dumb and boring. I got it because I always liked professor Irwin Corey, ""The World's foremost Authority"". I still like him, but this movie bombed!",1348185600,,151,4.846153846153846
748944,2,6303957315,"Troma Team are the kings of building movies around awful jokes and scantily clad women whose bodies are meant to make up for a lack of character development. After all, creating interesting female characters would require some actual work, and Troma would rather poke fun than challenge people's expectations.

This movie is chock-full of women in bikinis and other ridiculous outfits, and it is also occasionally downright hilarious with its awful physical humor. There is even a string of four puns in a row that is guaranteed to make any audience member laugh/groan. But it drags out a rather directionless premise for too long, and it comes off having little lasting value.

2.5/5",1341360000,,684,5.04424778761062
748945,4,6303957315,"This is a really obscure 80's movie with a lot of naughty and cheesy 80's humor. The movie is funny and makes a lot of good, timeless points about relationships. It's about a couple Bill and Carol who are going to break up and they go to court and get a crazy judge. This judge is really a fallen angel trying to get his wings back and he can only do this by helping the couple get back together. He does this by telling them about other couples in history and the movie goes off into hilarious satire-type historical scenes of various famous lovers. I was a kid when I saw this, some friends and I snuck out of my room and watched it at night when my parents were asleep so I hope I don't sound like a hypocrite when I say DON'T LET YOUR KIDS WATCH THIS MOVIE! There is a lot of sex, foul language and very adult humor. Might be ok for older teenagers but still could be considered inappropriate if parents are strict. As an adult it was funny to see it again and actually understand what everything meant. Might be a fun choice for couples who are having grownup's movie night and hysterical if you want to have a 'bad movie' party! This is truly so-good-it's-bad material in every way!",1163635200,16,1188,4.261061946902655
748946,5,6303957315,"I was shocked to find this movie was released on DVD. I've had a crappy VHS copy that I recorded off USA up all night probably 10 years ago. This movie is about two people who are going to get divorced, but an angel is sent to try to help them reconcile. Seriously, I don't know how this movie is not more well known. I die everytime I watch it. I'd rank it up there with Animal House and Fast Times. It's hard to believe it even came out on Troma when you compare it to the other movies they've made.",1057017600,23,501,3.9702970297029703
