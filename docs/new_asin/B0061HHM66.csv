4924282,4,B0061HHM66,"I'm a sucker for scary movies and these ones are great!  Especially if you have ever experienced anything spooky/paranormal in your life, these movies are sure to scare the crap out of you.  The only reason I rate this a 4 star instead of 5 is because in the box set, the opening is at the bottom rather than on the side.  I find this annoying for the purpose of shelf storage.",1351814400,,377,4.208333333333333

Very disappointed in the quality assurance from the manufacturer. I wanted to watch tonight, I guess i will have to go locally and buy the 5 movie set. I went onto Best Buy's website, and it is supposed to be 3 separate discs. I even put this disc into my player, thinking maybe they were all on 1. But, no.",1443139200,4,438,4.1647058823529415

4924305,2,B0061HHM66,"Is it just me, or were these really stupid, boring movies?  Lame, disjointed editing, sometimes hard to hear dialog and...well, what was the POINT?  I remember when the first came out in the theater and it was selling out.  Maybe if I'd seen it with the sheeple back then, I'd have a different opinion.  I just watched the two Grave Encounters on Amazon Prime, and they're much better than these, even if the second one is totally random.

As for the discs, decent quality picture.  I just wish the dialog was a little louder so you can hear it without blasting out your eardrums during the ""scares.""",1427328000,,600,4.5607476635514015

4924311,4,B0061HHM66,About 2 1/2 years ago I saw the second PA movie first on Netflix. I liked it. It was also my first time seeing movies with found footage style filming. I then saw the 1st one maybe a month later or so and liked that one too. I didn't quite understand the direction the movies were going at first but eventually I got the story and how it was laid out. I am not a horror movie fan but if I do watch them  its usually movies that deal with the paranormal. I hate slasher movies. I also have part 4 and I have the marked ones also on dvd. I can't wait for the 6th movie.,1422230400,,567,3.8461538461538463

4924328,2,B0061HHM66,"The first of the PA movies was interesting and scary because one didn't know what to expect. The ending definitely came as a surprise.  But by the time of the 2nd movie, it was already played out and you can see that they were trying to extend their one-hit wonder into a longer streak. But the way they did it, bringing back some of the previous characters, because yes, it actually was a prequel, I was a little interesting to find out how all of what happened in the first movie actually came about, but still not so great. The third movie was just a tired remake of storytelling going back to the very beginnings of the family story, which I frankly could have done without. It simply did not hold my interest.",1399852800,,714,4.368421052631579
4924329,5,B0061HHM66,These movies were scary made me jump and screen as I watched the events going on with this family in the movie. Creepy to the max and enjoyed the movies so much. Well done as it felt like you were there standing behind the video cam with them and trying to capture every detail as the cam took in the strange creepy events.,1395273600,,323,4.142857142857143

4924331,4,B0061HHM66,"If your looking for a back to basics Horror Movie (or set of them), Paranorml Activity (the first 3) is it.  While it is typical ""Found Footage"" style, the story is about as simple and as stripped down as it can get.  And that is what makes this Series GREAT!!!!!!
  The story revolves around a pair of sisters who seemingly have strange occourences/hauntings that happen around them.  The first half of each movie is a bit boring.  But this is the set up for the last half of each film as things get progressively freaky!
  So be prepaired to get literally scared with this trio of films!  And the great part is, they put them in one package so you can watch them one right after the other!
  Get your popcorn, your blanket, & make sure to be ready to be scared.  This 3 pack is definately a must for any film collection",1393545600,4,821,4.294117647058823

4924333,3,B0061HHM66,"If you're getting these because it says ""Unrated"", don't be mislead.  The flip side of the case indicates that these are all the ""R""-rated theatrical releases.  I give this three stars not because of the movies themselves (they get a 4-star rating) but because of this misleading posting.",1391299200,,288,4.979166666666667
4924334,4,B0061HHM66,"When I first watched the first film in the series I was surprised at how great the movie was.  I wanted a sequel to be made.  The second film was o.k. but not great.  The third film was awesome.  I loved the fact that it was based in the 80's.  I highly recommend this collection to Paranormal fans.  By the way, Katie Featherston is hot!!!!!! :)",1389571200,,346,4.166666666666667

4924338,5,B0061HHM66,"This is ""Blair Witch"" on steroids. All the movies are well crafted on a low budget. Not that this method isn't being over worked...the ""documentary"" presentation, but these are REALLY good. Very subtle horror. I won't reveal any spoilers for any of them. It's best to just see all of it on your own. But some of the special effects...MAN, they will just take your breath away and it's the simplicity of them that works so well. The newer movie ""The Conjuring"" draws heavily on some of the effects used in these three movies. A note...do not watch the alternate version ending of the first movie. It could ruin the experience of the triad. And do understand this is a long story that goes from present to past. It's part of the charm. I haven't seen the 4th installment, but have read it has little to do with these three anyway so just enjoy these three and let me know how the 4th one is to you. The ""Blair Witch"" comparison? Watch the third installment...get to the end...you be the judge! ;-)",1386374400,5,995,4.472527472527473

4924342,5,B0061HHM66,"I've always been a fan of paranormal movies and tv shows. I didn't know if I would enjoy these, but they surprised me. For having such low budgets, they do their job. They aren't supposed to be scary movies with heart warming endings. They are supposed to be home video style movies that creep people out and make them scream a few times. They also make you a little cautious to be home alone at night after you see them. These 3 are much better than the 4th installment. Many people think the 3rd movie is the best of the series. But I think all 3 do a good job. Getting 3 movies for that cheap is a good deal no matter who you are.",1382486400,,633,4.072

4924354,1,B0061HHM66,"First I want to say that my name is Raul Valdez, but im using my mothers account. I love horror movies. I own John Carpenters The Thing, Killer Klowns From Outer Space, Let The Right One In, Let Me In, Exorcist 1, Exorcist 3, Tales From The Crypt The Movie, and Series, The Evil Dead, Childs Play 1-3, and many others. Why did I make this list? Because I want to mention the fact that I LOVE HORROR MOVIES. But This franchise known as Paranormal Activity is crap. Part one consists of some lame noises, and a fire. Its barely worth your time if youve actually read up on the paranormal such as The Demonologist by Ed and Lorraine Warren. By the way I am an atheist, but even you can still enjoy the such a book, or another book such as Dark Sacrement, or a tv series like A Haunting for the fear factor. This movie invokes none of the fear that the TV show A Haunting, or the books I have mentioned does. Even the old music television show FEAR was scarier then this crap. You could enjoy the legends. If you want to be scared, go read one of the books ive mentioened. They have more books like that in the links section. If you want to see a lame bump in the night movie then this is it for you.

4924373,4,B0061HHM66,"I've only watched the 1st one & I'm about to watch the second of the trilogy.  It has sort of a Blair Witch tinge to it.  The whole thing is shot w/a handheld.  It was ok, if you like that sort of thing.  I think it really worked in this film.  I enjoyed it myself.  However, there will be no Oscars here!  All in all it was pretty good & yes I'll probably watch it again.  WARNING:  Don't watch this alone @ night.  Every little sound you hear will bring you right back to the movie again.  It's 2114.  I guess I'll be watching this tomorrow.  As TJ Holmes would say, ""You can go to bed now, but don't sleep.""",1352332800,,610,3.9833333333333334
