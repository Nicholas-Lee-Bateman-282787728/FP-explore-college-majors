35329,4,0780621832,"John Ford wants to paint a live fresco of the cavalry after Custer's death. So he chose an outpost of the cavalry and a captain who is going to retire. It is the story of his last days. There is no vision of the massacre of the Indians. There is no balanced vision of these Indian wars. The only moment when some distanciation is visible is when two whites are trying to sell fireguns to the Indians. They are punished in their attempt to make money out of these wars by being killed by the Indians. This gives of the Indians a vision of untrustworthy behavior. But what is essential is the attitude of the cavalrymen when they are confronted to two women who want to travel west in spite of the danger : tourism in times of war. These young men are shown as gallant and ready to serve these women as best they can, even if it means death for them. The vision of the cavalry is emotional too because the captain who retires does so with a deep grief in his heart. Once a cavalryman, forever a cavalryman. And he gets his nomination as a scout when he is already on his way to California. So he comes back and faces the end of his life in this outpost, fighting against Indians. A very well done film but rather shallow in meaning.

35330,5,0780621832,"If there's one John Wayne film just crying for a DVD release, this is it.
 Director John Ford once said he could conceive of nothing more beautiful than a horse in full stride. There are plenty of them in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon but even more than that, there's Monument Valley in a way that only John Ford could have filmed it.
  It's no accident that a Monument Valley vista now bears the name ""John Ford's Point."" And She Wore a Yellow Ribbon is THE John Ford Monument Valley film.

  There have been scores of Monument Valley films but no other is this good. Just look at the way the West Mitten hangs over Captain Brittles' moving scene at his wife's grave and the thunderstorm building over the wagons where Ford overruled his cinematographer and kept the cameras rolling.
  Many of us believe this is John Wayne's best acting performance ever and that his True Grit Oscar was payback two decades later, just as Henry Fonda's On Golden Pond statue was payback for The Grapes of Wrath.
  Let's just say that Wayne's performance here is so good if ever anyone argues that he was a celebrity more than an actor, the best way to refute them is simply to roll She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.
  But, please, please, PLEASE ! we need to be able to roll it in DVD.",1011139200,16,1257,4.393939393939394
35331,5,0780621832,"This is really a wonderful movie.  It may not be a good war movie, but it really gets Captain Brittles (John Wayne) into some romance.  However, I think that he shouldn't have a beard when he's in love, but it looks like he is in this movie and Rio Grande.  Maybe he should be young when in romance, because i don't think I can picture him in romance and as Brittles, even though I saw this movie.  But still, don't miss out on it.",1001808000,,431,4.095238095238095
35332,4,0780621832,"John Wayne probably gives the finest performance I've seen him give so far in this story of a Calvary officer, just days before his retirement, who goes on one last assignment.  He's accompanied by fellow officer Victor McLaglen who's very funny in a broad way, as well as two stiffly acted young lovers, a subplot that doesn't take too much away from the overall film (fortunately).  Wayne has to rely a lot less on heroics in this performance, and instead concentrate on characterization, which he does with much success.  He brings depth and a bittersweet quality to his character in a way that might surprise some.  With a beautifully photographed backdrop framing each scene, this John Ford feature is sure to please fans of Wayne and Westerns alike.",994032000,4,755,4.875
35333,5,0780621832,"Then think again. ""She Wore a Yelloe Ribbon"" is one of the Duke's greatest and most subtle performances. His interplay with the masterful Victor McLaglen is memorable and oftentimes hilarious. In this  movie, Wayne fully understands the emotions and complexities of his  character Nathan Brittles, the retiring cavalry leader.
One of the  greatest scenes that John Wayne ever played is when the troop gives him a  gold watch upon his retirement. As he slowly removes his spectacles, wipes  them off and then reads the sentiment, you really see that Wayne may not  have had the greatest range of any actor, but he was a great actor in the  right role. His characterization of Captain Nathan Brittles is near the top  of the list in all-time Duke performances.
I've seen this movie 30 times  or more and never weary of it. You always see something new each time you  view it. There is humor, pathos and action here and as always, John Ford's  masterful direction. A must see!",962496000,6,973,4.766467065868263

The amazing scenery, cinematography, spectacular horse chases, LACK OF BLOODY GORE, and yes, even the acting made this a very enjoyable film. Took me right back to when we saw this kind of movie at the Saturday matinee. Not very P.C. regarding native Americans, but true to the cultural era in which it was filmed, and an attempt was made to soften the Cowboys vs Indians stereotype.

35465,4,0780621832,"Released in 1949 and directed by John Ford, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon stars John Wayne as a captain near retirement who takes out a final patrol to alleviate an impending Native attack after tribes unite, emboldened by Custers humbling defeat at Little Big Horn. Unfortunately, his duty is hindered by two women who must be evacuated from the fort, the younger one attracting the attentions of two junior officers (John Agar & Harry Carey Jr.). Ben Johnson has a significant role as a dependable sergeant.

How do you review an old Western like this when you cant stand old-fashioned scores and hokey antiquated songs, not to mention the incongruent campy elements and slapstick (non)humor Ford is known for? Basically you have to ignore these factors and focus on the story and the actors. If you can do this, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon is worth checking out. Wayne was lean & mean at almost 42 (during shooting), but made out to be twenty years older for the role, while Dru was a striking hottie at almost 26. Its also cool seeing Johnson and Carey Jr. when they were so young. And the bright color photography really brings the film alive, particularly the gorgeous Monument Valley locations, unlike the flat B&W presentations of Fort Apache (1948) and Rio Grande (1950), the other two in Fords cavalry trilogy. Amazingly, the film utilizes real Native Americans for the cast and the movie gets extra points for this and their respected, accurate portrayal.

The film runs 103 minutes and was shot in Utah; Kayenta, Arizona; and California (studio). The screenplay was written by Frank S. Nugent & Laurence Stallings from a story by James Warner Bellah.

35466,5,0780621832,"SWYB is perhaps John Wayne's signature performance. Wayne is excellent as the aging, gritty, no-nonsense US Calvary officer Capt. Brittles.

She Wore A Yellow Ribbon (1949) is one of director John Ford's best westerns and is the second film in Ford's cavalry trilogy (the others being Fort Apache and Rio Grande).  I mainly want to write about the scenery and the Blu Ray release.  The scenery throughout the film is spectacular, especially in Monument Valley.  The scenery in this film is just as good as in The Searchers (1956), in my opinion.  The Blu Ray release is excellent and makes the movie look like it was shot and released yesterday.  Clear picture quality, vivid colors, great sound as well.  I actually like this 1 hour and 43 minute movie a little better than The Searchers.

If you're into John Wayne westerns directed by John Ford and want to get one on Blu Ray, then I highly recommend this one.",1488499200,5,929,4.548192771084337

35644,5,0780621832,"Mr. John Wayne would submit better performances in better movies. But 1949's She Wore a Yellow Ribbon - middle child in John Ford's celebrated cavalry trilogy - proved to be one more platform for Wayne to show that he could act, really act. Given, he'd had recent successes in Angel and the Badman (1947), Fort Apache (1948), and Red River (1948) - movies that also heralded his near twenty years in the biz - that enabled the Duke to at last get his propers as an actor with weight. Let's face it, folks just don't take them cactus melodramas too seriously.

The tale sets itself in 1876, and news of General Custer's devastating defeat still reverberate thru the rank and file of America's fighting men. Wayne plays a man a generation older, Captain Nathan Cutting Brittles of the U.S. Cavalry. He plays him with a gruff homespun charm and with the sort of wisdom and grace one achieves only by having lived a life. Brittles commands the 7th Cavalry at Fort Stark, but not for much longer. He retires in six days. Brittles has concerns. He's not sure if the man relieving him - Lt. Flint Cohill (John Agar) - is up to the task, seeing as Cohill seems too caught up in a lover's triangle that's ensnared a fellow lieutenant (Harry Carey, Jr.) and the spirited damsel, Ms. Olivia Dandridge (Joanne Dru). Even more pressing, Brittles' scouts report of parties of Cheyenne dog soldiers raiding the territory. Too, there's that pair of snaky gunrunners to keep an eye on. So, there's our soon-to-be-retiree, not wanting to go out with unfinished business.

What's different about Wayne's performance this time is that he's playing an older part, and he behaves accordingly. He's more measured in his motion, less likely to succumb to impulse. Maybe what ingratiates him the most to us is the way he takes his ease at his wife Mary's grave. There, habitually, he'd abide for a time, talking to her, confiding in her still. It's a simple character note, yet so moving.

When a runaway stagecoach is found and in it the doomed U.S. paymaster skewered with an arrow and not in it the payroll chest to pay his men's wages, Brittles - or as his boisterous Top Sgt. Quinncannon (Victor McLaglen) calls him: ""Captain darlin'"" - embarks on his last patrol in hopes of quelling an Indian uprising. Imagine the snit of the man when he learns he also must escort his commanding officer's wife and niece to a nearby stagecoach depot so that the refined niece can go back East. Naturally, the niece is Ms. Dandridge, she who suddenly sports a fine yellow ribbon in her hair, suggesting a sweetheart has struck her fancy. Oh, but she won't say which. So, now, there's a crap ton of emotional baggage to drag along and confound Brittles' two hotheaded rival lieutenants. Director John Ford, mean and tough-talking on set, always was one for a tempestuous romance.

She Wore a Yellow Ribbon is a classic entertainer thru and thru, and I should talk about John Ford. Typical of Ford, it's a rambling western rife with grand sentiment and jovial roughhousing and rousing skirmishes. Ford is so adept at depicting the romance of the Old West. Shot on location in majestic Monument Valley, the cinematography is simply breathtaking. Ford manipulates his pieces - his actors - against that sweeping backdrop, well aware of how evocative the imagery would be. Ford was as patriotic as the next dedicated gent. He wanted to share his immense pride in country and its fighting men and the amplified sense of camaraderie that manifests among these fighting men under severely trying conditions. In cinema as in real life, Ford was unflagging in holding up the value of military tradition and duty and honor. Some of ya cynics may think no way, that stuff's too maudlin and schmaltzy. Me, I eat up that stuff all day. I ate up the narrator's elegant closing remarks:

""So, here they are, the dog-faced soldiers, the regulars, the 50-cents-a-day professionals riding the outposts of a nation. From Fort Reno to Fort Apache - from Sheridan to Startle - they were all the same: men in dirty-shirt blue and only a cold page in the history books to mark their passing. But wherever they rode - and whatever they fought for - that place became the United States."" Preach, narrator.",1469232000,2,4245,4.7388362652232745

35662,5,0780621832,"This 1949 western was the second of the Director 'John Ford's' cavalry trilogy (all featuring 'The Duke' of course)
Veteran army officer'Captain Nathan Cutting Brittles' on the verge of retirement is given one last mission, in the aftermath of
'George Armstrong Custer's' defeat at the battle of the 'Little Big Horn' the Indians had been given a new confidence in their
ability to rid their lands of the white invaders.
Tribes that had once fought each other had now joined forces, there is trouble awaiting 'Nathan's' patrol with the 'Cheyenne'
and 'Arapaho' having broken out of their reservation attacking homesteads, patrols and indeed stage-coaches.
Normally the Captain would confront things head-on, however on this mission he has the added complication of having to escort
'Fort Starke's' Commanding Officers wife 'Abby' (Mildred Natwick) and niece 'Olivia' (Joanne Dru) away from the fort because of
the Indian uprising to a stage-coach post ad onto safety.
The Captain had written a note of objection to this added complication for the mission ahead in full knowledge that it would be
disregarded.
Down the years the Captain had in truth had his fill of fighting both in the Civil War and the struggle against the natives and hopes
to find a resolution before he walks away.
With the usual hint of romance between the Commanders niece and one of the Officers and the usual glimmer of humour often
seen in 'John Wayne' westerns and often provided as is the case in this film by 'Victor Mclaglen' who plays the whiskey-loving
'Top Sergeant Quincannon' this is a classic western played out with all the great traditions of the memorable westerns of that
era.
The film also featuring - 'John Agar' - 'Ben Johnson' - 'Harry Carey jnr' and 'George O'Brian'

Dialogue is crisp clear and music is perhaps a little tinny, though that may have more to do with my currently limited sound system, though I suspect it has to do with the source material as well.

Ford and cinematographer Winton Hoch (who'd go on to lens Ford's ""Quiet Man,"" ""Mister Roberts"" and  ""The Searchers"") play with various hues of red - from the dirt of Monument Valley, to blazingly glorious (but fake) red sunsets, to the red of Joanne Dru's lipstick, to the red jacket worn by the Indian villain - and each hue seems perfectly rendered.

35702,3,0780621832,"3 1/2 stars --  NOTE: The first paragraph comments generally on the first two of the ""cavalry trilogy,"" and it is identical with the corresponding paragraph in my review of ""Fort Apache.""  For comment on ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" specifically, you can start at paragraph 2.

I have just viewed the first two of John Ford's ""cavalry trilogy,"" which were very successful in their time (1948-50) and, judging by the amazon ratings are still very popular today. It's not really clear why that should be -- and I write as one who has watched them with pleasure. It must be the case that their original popularity had something to do with the state of the US immediately following World War 2, but I don't know exactly how that is to be understood. Part of it might be the image of the US Army, which is not presented as perfect but which is idealized in a more subtle way, perhaps, as suggesting that (a) for all its flaws, and for all that bad judgements can be found among its officers [like Henry Fonda in ""Fort Apache""], it represents an idea of discipline, order, and sacrifice, which is what we want to believe about those who commit violence on our behalf; and (b) it contextualizes these values with the unique aesthetic and cultural values associated with the landscape of American West, epitomized in Ford's movies by Monument Valley, which suggests at once an idea of humility (people are small in relation to an impressive ""American"" Nature) and a pride in values of endurance and courage associated with Western expansion. These suggestions are pure speculation on my part, and they don't help answer the question of why the movies retain their popularity. From a 21st Century viewpoint, there are all sorts of things ""wrong"" -- there's the crude stereotyping of the Irish, for example, and John Ford, who had directed Victor McGlaglen in ""The Informer"" a decade earlier, surely knew better. Then the young women are embarrassingly stereotyped coquettes -- I'm thinking of Shirley Temple and Joanne Dru -- who are completely lacking in any moral or psychological interest or plausibility. This is not the fault of the actresses. The older women characters are usually practical and sensible. There isn't a black face to be seen in either ""Fort Apache"" or ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,"" though both are set after the Civil War -- ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" is set specifically in 1876, the year of Little Big Horn. As if to make up for that, the Native American are represented as worthy of respect. The cavalrymen know their tribes -- they are not just an undigested and threatening ""other."" And in both ""Fort Apache"" and ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,"" they are shown as respecting those who give them respect -- in both of these movies, that's John Wayne. At the same time, one has to admit that these representations of mutual respect occlude a century of shameful treatment of Native Americans by the American government, and, at the local level, by many of the westward-bound white settlers whose endurance and courage we like to think about. So, it's a comfortable vision -- it still has the power to make us feel good about ourselves and perhaps to discourage any hard thinking.

So -- what about ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon""?  I think ""Fort Apache"" is a better movie.  It has something closer to a dramatic conflict at its heart, in the relationship between Wayne's and Fonda's characters, AND it doesn't shy away from violence.  This one does, and that's partly because the comic element in the movie -- the love rivalry between the two young officers Pennell and Cohill (Harry Carey Jr. and John Agar) for the attention of Olivia Dandridge (Joanne Dru) -- gets mixed up with the serious plot concerning the threat of Indian uprising following Sitting Bull's defeat of Custer at Little Big Horn, which the cavalry officers at Fort Starke learn about right at the movie's beginning.  The mix-up comes about as a result of a decision to send the women (including Miss Dandridge) back east to remove them from the threat by Indians.  A reconnaissance column is tasked to getting them to the railroad, but the women's presence slows the columns's progress and leaves it vulnerable to attack.  Captain Nathan Brittles (John Wayne) leads the column -- he's just days from retirement and this is seen as a last mission -- and he ends up having to get the women back to the fort when Indians stall the party.  There are some odd features, though.  Brittles has had dealings with the old Indian Chief Pony That Walks, and he visits the Indian camp, under a flag of truce, to see what can be worked out to avoid bloodshed.  The Chief welcomes Brittles -- lots of mutual respect, obviously -- but then says that he's helpless: it's these darn kids!  The young bloods want to fight and won't listen to the older, wiser ones (whom we see in one telling shot, looking grim).  So . . . is there any way to avoid bloodshed?  I won't spoil the ending, but I will say that its an ending more consonant with sentiment than with realism and that allows the viewer to keep some sympathy for the Indians and, once again, as I said earlier, celebrate the discipline and courage of the army.  It makes the movie more of a romance than anything else, especially when one considers the fraughtness of Indian-American relations in the 1870s.  It was more than a matter of unruly young braves, and the movie soft-pedals the reality of a very bad situation.

But there is one more thing that works in Ford's favor as we respond to the movie: it's shot in color and it looks great.  The Indians especially are just enchantingly filmed, and the costuming is gorgeous.  So are scenes of the Indian camp and the Monument Valley setting -- the enhanced spectacle is always arresting to the eye, and it helps offset one's irritation at the cliched lameness of the ""romantic"" plot, in which Dru is hardly credible as a coquette and the young officers seem too immature to be officers.  And a nod to John Wayne -- made up to look about twenty years older than his age at the time, he gives an engaging and credible performance of humane and wise widowed army ""lifer.""  You'll like how it ends for him.",1456099200,,6173,4.669124423963134

It is also noteworthy in it's portrayal of the Native American tribes which was even handed, even respectful.

35810,5,0780621832,"Probably the best of the John Ford/John Wayne ""Cavalry Trilogy.""  This one is a sentimental favorite of mine with this all star supporting cast from the ""Ford Players"" that usually are found in his films.  There is also a great supporting cast from others who made it into at least two of the three films in this trilogy.  Love watching Victor McLaglen as First Sergeant Quinncannon who has followed Captain Nathan Brittles  (Wayne) from the Mexican War through to their near simultaneous retirements following Custer's defeat at the Little Big Horn in 1876.  George O'Brien (Major Mack Alshard) returns in a great supporting role although in a different character from the one he played just as nicely in ""Fort Apache.""  Also making an appearance is a very young and capable John Agar as Lieutenant Flint Cohill.  New appearances from two ""regulars"" with John Ford are Arthur Shields (Dr. O'Laughlin) and Mildred Natwick (Mrs. Abbeyl Alshard.)  The two in the supporting cast that highlight this film for me are Harry Carey Jr. (Lieutenant Ross Pennell) and Ben Johnson (Sergeant Tyree.)  Johnson was a stunt man in ""Fort Apache"" who doubled for Henry Fonda in some riding sequences.  Ford was so impressed that he was promoted to a lead supporting role for this film.  I absolutely love watching this man ride.  I think he's one of the finest horsemen in cinema history.  To get a real taste of what he and Harry Carey Jr. can do on a horse you need to get the third film in the trilogy, ""Rio Grande.""  I won't spoil that for you if you haven't seen it yet.  She Wore A Yellow Ribbon was the only one of the three films in Technicolor and the Monument Valley is stunning.  I recently tested myself to see what were my Top Ten Favorite Westerns.  This Trilogy took up three of the ten slots and the Ford/Wayne team took 6 out of the ten.  You won't go wrong purchasing this movie and I strongly encourage you to get all three of them.  The characters, the colors and the Monument Valley make this a real winner.",1416700800,,2012,4.616901408450704

Now, that being said, it did not portray the Indians in the best light but it likely reflected the way things were at the time. If you focus on the duty, honor, courage portion of the movie and accept that the Indians felt that they were justified in what they did, then you can enjoy the movie.

35837,5,0780621832,"John Wayne, his screen name brings back the fond memories of a man, a legend, a time of true honor, integrity, chivalry at it's finest. John Wayne played many roles during his time. Roles that parents today and tomorrow would do well to introduce to their children for teaching right from wrong and in a role model that only John Wayne could properly bring to the screen with a bigger than life presence. She Wore a Yellow Ribbon was one such film and is still time honored for Wayne's portrayal of what it meant and means to be a member of the United States armed forces during war and peace. His respect for others is engraved in this film and bears witness to all that can be upheld and good even during times that darkness looms in so many ways. This is one of many John Wayne films that no parent should overlook for the message it presents and gives perfect meaning to the words, ""Carry on"".",1410566400,,897,4.377245508982036

The story is a good one, the actors top notch, and of the three John Wayne-John Ford cavalry movies made in the late `40s this one is my personal favorite.

35870,5,0780621832,"Made in 1949, this second part of John Ford's ""Cavalry Trilogy"" (coming after ""Fort Apache"" and preceding ""Rio Grande"") didn't age one bit and still remains today a great viewing - me for one, I can watch it again and again and again... Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

On the verge of his retirement, aging US Cavalry Capt. Nathan Cutting Brittles (John Wayne) is given one last mission: to take his troop and deal with a breakout from the reservation by the Cheyenne and Arapaho following the defeat of George Armstrong Custer at the Battle of the Little Big Horn... He must also escort two ladies, Abby Allshard (Mildred Natwick) and Olivia Dandridge (Joanne Dru), to a safe place away from the isolated outpost in wilderness. Two of his officers, 1st Lt. Flint Cohill (John Agar) and 2nd Lt. Ross Pennell (Harry Carey, Jr.), meanwhile vie for the affections of Miss Dandridge...

This is one of those films which reached perfection - there is simply no other word for it. Every single scene, every single diaog line, every single image and every single piece of music (and especially the songs) are PERFECT! The film is frequently very moving and sometimes solemn, but also contains TONS of humour and the general tone is in the same time touching, heart-warming and optimistic - something mostly missing nowadays from the movies...

John Wayne (aged for the needs of the scenario by carefully applied make up) is of course the main star of this film, but he certainly doesn't monopolise the screen time. In fact, another of the reasons why this film is such a masterpiece is the large time and latitude given to the secondary characters, especially Top Sergeant Quincannon, played wonderfully by Victor McLaglen and Sergeant Tyree, formerly known as Captain Tyree, in times when he served with Confederate cavalry with General Lee, played impressively well by Ben Johnson. Do not miss also Private John Smith - he appears only in a short scene, but it is an extremely powerful one...

This film, even more that ""Fort Apache"", is a tribute to the works, fights and tribulations of US Cavalry in the Wild West plains in the years which followed the War Between States - and in this aspect also it succeeds greatly.

This is one of those films everybody should see at least once in a lifetime, a masterpiece made by one of the greatest directors ever, at a time when he was at the very top of his game... To buy, watch and keep ABSOLUTELY! Enjoy!",1401062400,,2475,4.746511627906977

35874,3,0780621832,"Typical 1940s cowboys and Indians style movie. It takes place in the south-west in 1876 against a backdrop of the recent defeat of Custer and the claim of Indian insurrection under the alleged direction of Sitting Bull. Captain Brittles (John Wayne) must lead a column through hostile Indian country but is forced to return to the Fort in defeat on the eve of his retirement from the Army. He is retained as a scout and he undermines the Indian resistance by driving their pony herd away while they're in camp and thus they are forced to return to the reservation. I was a little uncomfortable with the black and white good guys versus bad guys plot. Also, of slight annoyance to me were the numerous errors with the uniforms. I understand the tan hats didn't come into use until the 1880s. May of the men were wearing the kepi hats in the Civil War style with the insignia on top of hat instead of the 1872 style crossed sabers on the front. Enlisted men were wearing officer's hat cords on the slouch hats. As well, I think the salutes were still the palms out in those days instead of the hand flattened as it is nowadays.
A fun movie to be taken with a grain of salt.",1399161600,,1171,4.400921658986175

This is John Ford at his best, character driven soldier sagas, SWAYR the 2nd in his so-called calvary trilogy, this being the solo color offering. (Winton Hoch won an academy award for its cinematography in 1949. Reportedly, Ford and Hoch based much of the film's imagery on the paintings and sculptures of Frederic Remington.)
Set in a remote plains miltary outpost, the tension derives from Duke's forced retirement while the tempers of nearby Arapaho and Cheyenne Indians heat up. As the underlying conflict mounts, the life within the fort is explored and is as much the story as a pending Indian skirmish.  Not much ""action"" takes place per se, this is more of a Ford interrelational piece and a damn good one.
John Wayne is exceptionally effective in his role as a man older than he actually was at the time, ironic since many of his later films had him playing younger, and this film gives him a chance to explore the depths more than his action flicks.

This was the Army that tamed the west not what some do-gooders or revisionist try to make it. Yes it had its good days and bad but they got the job done. One point that is made here is something most people do not know. Following the end of the Civil War the Army activated several regiments of cavalry and infantry for duty on the western frontier. Two things happened, 2 cavalry and infantry regiments were made up of black troops with white officers, one of which I know is still serving. The other being taking men who had served in the Confederate Army as most of these men  had combat experience. However it would not be until the Spanish American War that former Confederate officers would be allowed to serve as Army officers, many did serve as NCOs. Hence the part where Trooper Smith was in fact a former General Officer in the Confederate Army. John Ford did his research well for these movies which is more than I can say for a good many made today. As a retired Army NCO I can say that this movie made me proud of the Army. Yes I would recommend this one highly to anyone interested in how the west was really won.",1374796800,2,1282,4.169354838709677

I loved it when he kept hauling out his ""brand new silver watch"" at every opportunity.  I can't imagine anyone else playing this part.

35980,4,0780621832,"This was the kind of film I watched as a kid:  all the good guys were handsome, indians formed an essentially indiscriminate mass of whooping killers, and the backdrops they rode through were reddish fakes.  Still, this is a truly great viewing experience, with vivid characters, plenty of humor, and a good plot.

Wayne is an old calvary captain about to retire, going on his last mission, which included 2 tough women in wagons to slow him down.  He is an honest galoot, loved by his men, and wise from experience.  Interestingly, the story begins right at the moment that Little Big Man ends, with the coalition of tribes that killed Custer, who is present as a cherished memory.  So they set out on patrol and to deliver the women to the stage coach and safety.  However, along the way, it turns into a dangerous cat and mouse with the Indians, in particular the Cheyenne, and there are many good episodes of near slaughter.  Wayne does his best.  THere is also a subplot where the younger girl must choose between 2 officers, who are at each other for the whole film.  Finally, as he is about to retire, Wayne evolves and changes his mission to one of preserving peace.

Bristling with stereotypes as it is, this is a fun film.  It is only that, as a history enthusiast who grew up rebellious in the 1960s, I see it with very different eyes than I did as a boy in the 1950s.  In a way, the subtext - what a different place America was before the Vietnam War - was present in my mind during the whole viewing.  It made me feel deeply nostalgic but also fascinated.  There is not a single jot of cynicism in the film, not even the blaring patriotic marches of the soundtrack were intended to reflect the irony that they would today, and empathy for the plights of the Indians is utterly missing in all the nationalistic fervor.  Indeed, that perspective made it doubly enjoyable for me to watch, though my European wife was uniformly critical of it throughout.  However, my kids would not enjoy this, though we will certainly watch it for purposes of discussion.

Recommended for all these reasons.",1345334400,,2101,4.557333333333333
35981,4,0780621832,"This ""feel good"" 1949 Western film romanticizes the life of the U.S. Cavalry on the ""Indian"" front amidst personal dramas most notably focused upon which young man will get a certain woman (Miss Dandridge played by Joanne Dru) as their wife. John Wayne plays an old officer who is just a few days away from retirement when the ""Indian"" problem boils over. In this picture Wayne's character is clever rather than ""charge forward and worry about things later"" very typical in his later career. His sidekick Sergeant Quincannon had some of the more humorous moments (played by Victor McLagen).

A good job was made in references to the American Civil War as well as various officers in the U.S. Cavalry who had been a lot higher in rank in the Confederacy but were now several notches down. There's an old fellow who is a very minor character and dies and this lowly officer is later mentioned as a brigadier general of the Confederacy.

At the very end Wayne's character comes to realize how much the U.S. Cavalry means to his identity.

The film was directed by John Ford and part of his U.S. Cavalry trilogy. The movie just before this one was ""Fort Apache"" and the one right after was ""Rio Grande"". Of the three I think I most like ""Rio Grande"". Anyway, this particular picture won an Academy Award for Best Colored Cinematography for its sweeping views of Monument Valley (located in upper Arizona).

I graded this film its period. It would be unfair to compare certain parts to the movies of today.

35984,1,0780621832,"This is the second of John Ford and John Wayne's cavalry trilogy (Fort Apache and Rio Grande are the other two). The yellow ribbon in the title refers to a tradition that the girls would wear a yellow ribbon to indicate that they were faithful to a lover in the cavalry. But the girl in the story manages to get three men to each believe the ribbon is for him. Neat trick, the little hussy!

Anyway, John Wayne plays an officer who is one week away from retirement as the movie opens. He was actually pretty young at the time, but the makeup people did such a credible job that he really looks like he really did look when he got old -- except, as I recall, he was heavier than in this movie.

The movie opens with a narrator who says ""Custer is dead."" This was the news of the day, and the Indians are teaming up, all the different tribes -- at least the young warriors -- to fight the white man, because the buffalo came back as Custer died, so they figured it was a sign from the Great Spirit. You know, when these religious fanatics take a notion . . .

Anyway, the thing is a pretty typical cavalry versus Indians, with Wayne taking time out to talk to an old friend, one of the chiefs, who explains that he cannot control the young bucks because they don't listen to him anymore, since they got this sign from the Great Spirit. Nevertheless, Wayne and his soldiers (in the last hour or so of his command) stampede the Indian's horses right through their village and so make it impossible for them to make war.

35993,5,0780621832,"In ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"", John Wayne played an aging US Cavalry officer on the verge of retirement. There is one catch. An Indian uprising has started, and it threatens to put him out in the graveyard instead of out to pasture.

This film has a surprisingly deep story, with a lot of heart. It is very likely one of Wayne's best acting performances. A young Ben Johnson plays an important role in the story, and really shows why his star would shine in Westerns for decades to come.

The framing of western vistas is John Ford perfect. The direction of the few small unit cavalry actions comes across as sensible and accurate. These are professional soldiers doing their job the best way they know how. They aren't heroes ... unless pushed to it by exigent events. The serious tension in the film is released through truly humorous scenes from time to time in expert manner. That is a dying technique in Hollywood. Now tension releases of the humorous sort are as likely to be just plain silly (I reference any of several James Bond films), or even worse, to not come at all ... as in the otherwise excellent but devastatingly fatiguing Dark Knight.

Most surprisingly, John Wayne's brave, heroic last ditch effort to solve the situation doesn't really work out. We're left at the end of the film knowing that there is still a lot of work to be done. No deus ex machina made everyone safe. That's a very different bit of plotting for a western from that era.

If you're a fan of older westerns and have somehow missed this one, its time to check it out. Many regard ""The Searchers"" to be the best combination of John Ford directing and John Wayne acting. I think ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" may actually just edge it though.",1310083200,,1728,4.528846153846154

Since I didn't tell him I thought he was a ""wimp"" and I don't, of course, I was eager for him to see the DVD and tell me what he thought.  He Totally liked it and if he likes something really well, will watch it over and over so it was a good investment. I haven't watched it since it first came out, but will again someday.

""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" (1949) remains among the director's masterpieces - boasting a memorable character performance by John Wayne as Captain Nathan Brittles. Cinematographer Winton C. Hoch deservedly earned an Academy Award for his exquisite Technicolor artistry. The Monument Valley landscape rarely looked this stunning. Once again, the Ford Stock Company acquits itself admirably.",1296086400,,451,5.848484848484849
35996,4,0780621832,"...but that is still saying a lot. Although the most spectacular looking of the three films, the acting of some of the important characters, and the relatively uninteresting romance portion of the story really makes this the least of the three movies in terms of film viewership.

John Wayne is terrific as the troop leader who  has lots of experience fighting Indians as the settlers try to tame the west. He portrays a mature, intelligent and wily commander who understands the mission and likes to lose as few troops as possible. His performance is ably supported by Ben Johnson (who started his career as Wayne's stunt double) as his uber helpful ""galloper,"" Harry Carey Jr, as a four year trooper who  is still wet behind the ears, and Victor McLaglen who is Wayne's tippling aide de camp. McLaglen can take some corny material and put a smile on the audience's collective face. Some of the supporting players really fall down on the job, however. The worst offender is JoAnn Dru, who, although pretty, cannot manage to convey why she has the whole fort in an uproar other than her looks, which are no more fascinating than the other young ladies stationed there. Her true love interest, John Agar, creates absolutely no heat in his scenes with her and delivers his lines in a controlled monotone, not exactly the intonations calculted to inspire ardor in the female heart. Usually a good actress, Mildred Natwick just isn't the gal for her part of a still attractive chaperone who has seen life around the fort for a long time and knows what is going on behind the scenes.

The best parts of the film are the war scenes with the Indians who have joined forces across tribes following Sitting Bull's stunning victory against General Custer. Their improved numbers and fierce attitudes make for some fine war scenes. Wayne's foray into the Indian encampment to talk peace with his old friend, an Indian chief who has lost control of the young warriors is striking. Wayne conveys his willingness to talk peace with his hunting and fishing buddy, while doing a little recon on exactly where those horses are corralled. When he asks Ben Johnson ""Ever been scared Tyree?"" we realize Wayne and Johnson are just as likely to be struck down by arrows as escape the peace visit with their lives. Wayne's scene, in which he covertly  puts on his reading glasses to read the inscription on a retirement gift, shows just how much the warrior has  aged while in the army.

The real honors of the film go to director Ford. A sudden lightning storm came up during filming. As cinematographer Hoch packed up equipment to leave, Ford instructed him to photograph the storm. The resulting scenes are absolutely thrilling to watch. Hoch won an Oscar for his work on this film, but lodged a complaint against Ford with the cinematographer's guild for endangering his crew.

This is a superior western and should be seen especially compared with the other two movies from the trilogy (although Ford didn't think the three were related in any particular  way). The best of the three is undoubtedly Fort Apache, featuring a compelling story, a tour de force performance by Henry Fonda, splendid black and white photography, and beautiful editing. Rio Grande is my second favorite of the three. Wayne and leading lady Maureen O'Hara are compelling as the mature lovers who have been estranged for twenty years, but are brought together by their son's enlistment in the army under Wayne, as well as the fact that they are still hot for each other. In both of these two films the supporting cast does an unbelievable job of portraying the danger, tensions, and strain of outpost life. See them all. I think you will  be impressed.",1279929600,4,3709,4.790297339593114

35998,5,0780621832,"The second part of Ford's ""Cavalry Trilogy"" (and the only one that was filmed in color) finds John Wayne playing, as he did the year before in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-River/dp/6304696612/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red River</a>, a man of mature years (he was only 42 at the time).  It's 1876, and the Custer fight took place only about four months ago, rousing the tribes to a patriotic fury against the white man.  Capt. Nathan Brittles has been a soldier for 40 years, ever since he left his father's Indiana farm as a barefoot kid.  For the past nine of those years he has served at Fort Starke, ably sided by Top Sergeant Quincannon (Victor McLaglen), who has been at his side at least since the Civil War, and cared for the graves of his family--his wife and two young daughters perished, probably of one of the diseases that frequently scourged the Indian-fighting army, in the first year of his sojourn there.  Now, five days before his retirement, he is ordered to head up a final patrol, accompanied by his two dependable sergeants, Quincannon and Tyree (Ben Johnson), of whom the latter was a Captain in the Confederate forces, and his two lieutenants, Flint Cohill (John Agar), the son of a general, who has been at Starke as long as himself, and Ross Pennell (Harry Carey, Jr.), a ""spoiled rich kid"" who's seen only four years of service and plans to resign as soon as possible.  These two are engaged in a rivalry over Olivia Dandridge (Joanne Dru), the visiting niece of Abby ""Old Ironpants"" Allshard (Mildred Natwick), whose husband Mac (George O'Brien) commands the post.  But with the Indian situation about to come to a boil, Maj. Allshard is resolved to send both Olivia and her aunt back to the East for the winter, and Brittles is unwillingly saddled with getting them to Sudreau's Wells to catch the stage.  A murdered and robbed paymaster, a sinister Indian agent who sells rifles to the hostiles on the side (watch for Paul Fix in a small role as his interpreter), and old sectional feelings (several of Brittles's C Troop are former Confederates, including ""Trooper John Smith,"" once known as Brig. Gen. Rome Clay) make for even more complications than the Indians can provide.

With a rich array of interpersonal relationships and unforgettable characters (and actors), splendid Monument Valley scenery, plenty of humor and fast-moving action, and a strong sense of truthfulness to reality (watch for the three ever-barking dogs who accompany the troop on its patrol), this is one of the best of the many team-ups by Ford and Wayne, showing both of them--and Ford's famous ""stock company""--at their best.  It's certainly among my favorite Wayne films, Westerns, and movies overall.",1270512000,2,2762,5.066079295154185
35999,5,0780621832,"I remember when I was going to college in the 1960s and being a great Wayne fan, I would hear from a lot of boobs about what a terrible actor the Duke was. (This was before the Oscar for ""True Grit"" and Wayne's final great performance in ""The Shootist."")  Well the individuals who spoke negatively of the Duke obviously never saw ""The Searchers,"" ""Red River,"" ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" or this film.  They were wrong about a lot of things, not the least of which was what a fine actor the Duke was, (on top of being the greatest movie star of all-time.)
This film features one of his greatest performances as Captain Nathan Brittles, a veteran cavalry officer just a few days short of retirement.  Obviously, being a John Ford western, an indian uprising is going to start before the Captain can permanently take his uniform off.  Wearing make-up to make him appear much older than his actual age, Wayne has some wonderfully sensitive scenes, especially the ones of him talking to his late wife while sitting at her grave each night.
This is the only one of Ford's cavalry trilogy to be filmed in color and, other than ""The Searchers,"" it is probably his most beautiful film.  Filmed in Monument Valley, with the red soil kicking up red dust as the horses trample through and the beautiful blue skies, this must have looked stunnning on the big screen.
The supporting cast is great with John Agar and Joanne Dru (very attractive) doing a nice job as the constantly bickering young lovers, a young Ben Johnson as a former confederate soldier turned U.S. cavalry sergeant, and Victor MacLaglen hilarious as the stereotypical drunken Irish cavalry sergeant.  The rest of the cast is terrific as well.
The extras include some color home-movies of Wayne and Ford scouting locations for this film, a re-release trailer and some information regarding the films Wayne and Ford did together.
This and ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" came out the same year.  Wayne was nominated for the oscar for best actor for ""Sands of Iwo Jima.""

- John Wayne at his very best, playing a high ranking commander on the brink of retirement and superbly conveying a man at the end of his career.
- beautiful colour photography of Ford's favourite location, Monument Valley
- a rousing score

However, there are some drawbacks:

- a subplot, a romantic triangle, played poorly by John Agar and Joanne Dru who is particularly superficial.
- the usual Ford cliches encompassing tiresome Irish humour from Victor McLaglen and sentiment such as the cliched burial scene (Ford repeats himself).
- a dreary screenplay with too much talk and not enough action for much too long.

The more Westerns and more John Waynes I watch, the less I like this movie. Other than the famous director and lead actor, and nice surroundings, this movie has nothing. No story, no charactor, no plot, just nothing.

What is a western movie? You need actions and fast pace. You do not get any from this movie. There is not much plot. The pace is very slow. The old man is near retiring and it is very boring. The girl theme (Olivia Dandridge) is not entertaining. There is not much to say, just not a fan of it at all. Really boring.

36005,5,0780621832,"John Ford's Cavalry Trilogy is a series of three movies, ""Fort Apache"" BW (1948), ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" Color (1949) and ""Rio Grande"" BW (1950) in which we get an insight into the life and manners of the United States Cavalry during the Indian Wars. Each is an independent movie and may be viewed in any order.

""She Wore A Yellow Ribbon"" is a nostalgic view of the ending of a career for Capt Nathan Brittles (John Wayne), a career in which he has spent the last 40 years of his life.  ""I was a lad in blue jeans and barefoot when I left my daddy's farm to join the army"", he comments and the pain of leaving the career he has loved all his life is painfully evident.  Nathan's whole life has been the cavalry and on that painful night before retirement he comments, ""Now tomorrow I'll be glad if the blacksmith asks me to shoe a horse."" As evident by the cemetery scene, Nathan Brittles views retirement as the beginning of the end; his life will no longer have meaning or purpose as he awaits to join his wife and family in death.

But there is still one last patrol, one last mission, one last time to ride as Captain of the Troop before surrendering his command to two younger officers, Lt(s). Cohill and Pennell (John Agar and Harry Cary Jr.), who he has trained but who he feels are still not ready to assume command; two officers who spend more time fighting over a young girl, Olivia Dandridge (Joanne Dru), then attending to duties.

For the Indians, they are uprising in the wake of the Custer disaster of 1876, as tribes join together old quarrels forgotten.  Along with the return of the buffalo, they see it as a sure sign of the return of Indian dominance to the Great Plains.  But for Nathan Brittles this last patrol is his attempt to prevent another Indian war.

This is John Wayne as his very best, a classic movie in every sense of the word featuring the beautiful Monument Valley so typical of John Ford westerns only this time filmed in glorious color.  Even Mother Nature lends a hand here, no special CGI effects, for the troops rides on with a pending thunderstorm approaching in the background an event which won this film an Oscar.  The movie also has most all of John Ford's stock Irish actors present, John Agar, Ben Johnson, Harry Cary Jr., Victor McLaglen, Mildred Natwick, George O'Brien, and Francis Ford.  Many of them also appearing in the other movies of this series as well.

As an extra historical note you will want to watch out for the old Indian leader, Chief Pony that Walks (Chief John Big Tree).  You have seen him many times before and not just in the movies.  Chief John Big Tree, 100% Seneca, who in 1912, posed as the Indian on the famous Indian-Head/ Buffalo nickel which was in circulation during the early to mid 20th century.

This Oscar winning film is truly John Wayne and John Ford at their best.

For a western, there isn't much action in this film. However, the beautiful colors and the magnetism of John Wayne, who dominates this film, still make it interesting. Victor McLaghlen adds some humor to the tale with with whiskey- drinking, hard-fighting Irishman role and Ben Johnson is good as the key scout.

36008,5,0780621832,"This represents one of the Cavalry Trilogy, directed by John Ford and starring John Wayne (the other two in the series--""Fort Apache"" and ""Rio Grande""). Each is more nuanced than like movies by other directors.

This one features John Wayne playing Captain Nathan Brittles, nearing the end of his long career, nearing a retirement that he clearly is uncomfortable with. Wayne is playing a character much older than he was at the time. And, if one says that Wayne could not act, this movie is clearcut refutation of that charge. He makes his character work.

Monument Valley provides the background for this movie. There is a set of familiar figures in John Ford's repertory company (e.g., Victor McLaglen as an old Irish sergeant nearing retirement; Harry Carey, Junior and Ben Johnson show up, too).

The nuances include a more positive view of Native Americans than found in other Westerns; this is as much a study of different characters in the movie as of action; there is also the sympathetic portrayal of former Confederates who are serving in the cavalry.

Brittles' wife is buried here, and he visits her every so often to ""report in."" One of the more poignant moments is when Brittles receives a watch from his troops, with the inscription ""Lest we forget.""

John Wayne's performance as an aging soldier was so out of character for him at the time, and yet he plays the part perfectly.  Even the make-up used to age him looks natural.  John Ford's use of Monument Valley for the location provided some breathtaking background while his direction is perfection itself.  Today the script seems a little cliched, but when I first saw the film it was fresh and brisk and still seems that way today.  And the supporting cast - what a dream!  Not one wrong note in the crowd, but as a real standout, Ben Johnson as Sergeant Tyree is one of my favorite characters in film.  His sense of loyalty first to his old Confederate comrades and now in defeat  his loyalty to his new commanders makes him a complex and yet simple man all at the same time.  Everything else about this film is world class; the music, the photography, the costumes, everything stands out here.

The film was the second of Ford's trilogy of films focusing on the US Cavalry, the other two films being Fort Apache (1948) and Rio Grande (1950). With a budget of $1.6 million, the film was one of the most expensive westerns of the time, but became a major hit for RKO and remains a popular classic today.

Known for its breathtaking views of Monument Valley located on the southern border of Utah; the cinematographer, Winton Hoch, won the 1950 Academy Award for Best Color Cinematography. Ford and Hoch based much of the film's imagery on the paintings and sculptures of Frederic Remington.

Ford demonstrated a number of standard Cavalry procedures in horse management in this and other movies. Strict rotation between walk, trot, and leading the horses made them last as long as possible. They were still no match for the lightly burdened Indian horses for endurance, but US Cavalry horses were fed grain (when available), and this helped even the odds a bit.

The film is named after a song common in the U.S. military, ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"", which is still used today to keep marching cadence. It is a variant of the song ""All Around My Hat"".

On the verge of his retirement, the aging Cavalry Capt. Nathan Cutting Brittles (John Wayne) deals with a series of attacks by the Cheyenne following the defeat of George Armstrong Custer. Unwilling to see more lives needlessly taken, Brittles takes it upon himself to try to make peace with Chief Pony That Walks (Chief John Big Tree).

The movie's narrator references Pony Express rider's concerns over George Custer's defeat. Custer was killed in 1876, whereas the pony express made its last ride fifteen years earlier in 1861 after only a year of service.

I can not believe that I went and bought another fifties western with again John Wayne as the star.  But I did, and I think I am becoming addicted to these slow paced movies with ""heroes"" who have strong character and strong morals.
  These horse soldiers of the past led a lonely and dangerous life and they are no longer portrayed in the movies of today.  The location where the movie was filmed is a lonely place but has a stark beauty that comes across in the movie and grabs you.  Especially the scenes of the clouds and sky.  Reminded me of the saying: ""Big Sky Country"".
  Again the Native Americans were portrayed ""fifties style"" compared to a modern movie such as ""Dances With Wolves"", however, for the time frame of the movie the portrayal was not bad.
  I enjoyed the movie and John Wayne's portrayal as an aging cavalry officer who is due to retire but enjoys the life he leads very much, and I found his character very believable.  The story is simply told, but there is a story.  This is sometimes lacking in today's movies.

While I love all the aforementioned films, this one is the one where everything worked perfectly. The contrast of Wayne's seasoned Capt. Brittles with the two younger officers, the lonely life Brittles lives with no wife or family vs. the younger men competing for the hand of lovely Joanne Dru, the comedy relief provided by the incomparable Victor McLaglen, the savvy wisdom of(former confederate captain) Sgt. Tyree, nothing is missing. This was John Ford's stock company at it's best, with perhaps only The Searchers to compare.

36032,5,0780621832,"John Wayne lives this part.  A battle hardened veteran of the war between the states, a career officer - Captain Nathan Brittles - finds himself on the Western Frontier nearing the end of his career.  A man for whom the military is not just a way of life, it is life.  And, in a remarkably sensitive fashion for the time, the ""hostiles"" are shown to be a civilized and intelligent people who have been pushed time and time again by the western expansion of this nation and are simply fighting to survive.  It would have of course been easy just to shoot another movie reflecting an Indian uprising with calvary charges and heroic gestures.  Thank goodness we're spared that.  Instead, we have a deeply well orchestrated movie developing many different characters and plot lines.  While he is Army through and through, Captain Brittles still poignantly takes time to water the desert flowers on his wife's grave and to talk to her gently until that day comes that he joins her. And, Sgt Tyree, the irrepressible scout that is almost an extension of Captain Brittles, has another life too that we learn about, in a touching and well done scene not often witnessed in today's pyrotechnic oriented films.  Is this the best western I've ever seen?  Maybe, maybe not, but the Searchers (who can forget that shadowy ending shot with John Wayne framing the door?) is close (not to mention the sleeper The Tin Star with Henry Fonda) and so are Fort Apache, My Darling Clementine (Henry Fonda again), and Gunfight at the OK Corral (Kirk Douglas) - some of which have been mentioned by other reviewers as well.

36035,5,0780621832,"'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon' remains for many viewers their favorite Ford film, and it is certainly the most striking visually... Winton C. Hoch won an Oscar for his Technicolor photography...

The compositions and photography around Ford's new stamping ground of Monument valley are great to look at as always... The Monument Valley goes from bright sunlight to hail and sleet...

There is a melancholy mixed together in those incredible vistas, with a certain sense of dreamlike contemplation... A backdrop so complex but so significant as the human characters...

Ford has superbly achieved a huge and composite demonstration of all the legends of the frontier cavalryman... Never have the legendary troops been through the silent 'Indian country' and across the magnificent Western plains so brilliant, vivid, exciting and romantic...

Ford has surely done better himself, unquestionably with 'My Darling Clementine,' and 'The Searchers,' yet one has to admit the undisputed merits of 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.' Even the usual criticism launched against it-that it is a Western influenced by feeling rather by reason--can be dismissed at the start... Certainly Ford can be sentimental but only when the springs of honest feeling run dry and lose their inspiration, and this never really happens in 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.'

The story is that of an older cavalry officer (John Wayne) who is six days from retirement at Fort Stark when he's sent out, in a last mission, to escort the Major's wife (Mildred Natwick) and her niece, an attractive single lady (Joanne Dru) out of the danger area... Wayne tries to fulfill his military role protecting his female charges against the uprising of the Sioux, Cheyenne, Kiowa, Comanche and Apaches...

Wayne possibly more than any other Western star has re-created and heightened the mythology of the West-one has only to watch again his absolute and ideal image in 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,' or his avenging Ethan in 'The Searchers,' to be reminded of how irresistible the Duke has been on the cinema screen...

'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon' is above all a sentimental movie, with irresistible scenes, full of Ford's best touches:

- The cavalry engaged in its everyday work... Wayne simply can't picture himself in a world far from the army...

- The comic interaction between Wayne and Victor McLaglen, two hardcore professional officers...

- The bravery of Sgt. Tyree (Ben Johnson), chased by hostile Indians, who must finish his mission by reporting to the captain what he saw...

- The rivalry of two young cavalry lieutenants (John Agar and Harry Carey Jr.) in love with the same woman, each competing to have her wear a yellow ribbon as a token of his love...

- The 'beloved brute,' the tough-soft cavalry sergeant sharing his saddle with a little orphan rescued from a devastated stage station...

- Ford celebrating McLaglen's lachrymose in self-indulgent fisticuffs in an epic saloon fight...

- The last inspection of the C. troops almost bringing tears to Wayne's and the audience's eyes, as he reads the inscription that means so much to him...

- Wayne riding into the war camp of the Indians to stop a war...

- The U. S. cavalry at full gallop descending upon the encampment, firing wildly and stampeding hundred of Indian ponies...

- The evocative use of music, notably the gay and spirited theme song of the yellow ribbon, played countless times...

'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon ' is an exciting story with strong characters and sentiment, highly enjoyable, and beautiful...",1162857600,6,3536,5.056798623063683

Starring John Wayne as 60-year old Captain Nathan Brittles on the verge of retirement, it has an excellent supporting cast, not the least being the great Victor McLaglen as First Sergeant Quincannon and Ben Johnson as Sergeant Tyree (a former Confederate officer).

This movie has it all, from exciting action and Indian fights, to heartful drama and romance. The photography is absolutely spectacular and the acting is top notch. The cast obviously has a great amount of chemistry, like the friends that they all actually were (being a part of the famed ""John Ford Stock Company""). This transfers to the screen superbly. However, don't expect a garden-variety western, as the action is definitely a background to the story of the lone Cavalry Troopers on the frontier. Even the Indians are mostly portrayed in a way that seems rather historically correct, plus they are not a homogenous group (just like the White soldiers and their families aren't).

In all this is one of the finest movies I've ever seen or owned, with John Wayne's greatest performance of his long career. I highly recommend it to everyone!",1161043200,2,1230,5.0245098039215685

The DVD Review The 2006 one

 First lets break a lot of hearts let it be known the only real difference between this one and the first release is the case which isn't a flip disc. Now that said lets get to the movie.

The Movie

 It stars John Wayne as a retiring Captain in the US cavalry. It has the usual cast of characters from the John Ford cast if they were in the other ones there in this one all that missing is Maureen O'Hara. The story is around a Native American uprising after the cutting down of Custard and the 7th cavalry. Young Native Americans take it as a sign to retake there land. JW is the man who of course has to fix it. It one of the best written of the John Ford Cavalry movies. It also to me shows the duke can act considering he plays and elderly captain and makes you believe.

The Transfer:

 It holds up well for not getting the Disney treatment it really deserves. Some flicker but its not noticeable less you looks for it.

The Audio

 2.0 no surround sound mix they just won't spoil us with the horse thumping we deserve and the cavalry charge.

The Extras

Cast & Crew

Just shows the cast and crew names

John Ford Home Movies

Well its grainy the music isn't that great but it still looks better than the DVD transfer of the Green Beret...lol, there not much too it less u want to see a Mexican kid play a violin

36039,5,0780621832,"Often a review for me is an opportunity to learn about a book, a movie, a piece of music that I had experience of in the past and have fragmented , incomplete memories of and certain questions about. For instance what I most remember about this film is the song, 'She wore a yellow ribbon' and with it a strange kind of mysterious feeling. I did not then when I saw it as a child really understand what was going on.

So now after all the years I know the story is about Capt. Brittles (John Wayne) and that it takes place after Custer's Last Stand, that his final task as a cavalry officer is escorting two ladies to a coach which will take them home. I know that there is a moving scene in which Capt. Brittles mourns his wife. I know too ( from reading other Amazon reviews a number of which are truly excellent) that one of the most powerful and moving features of the film is the landscape, the atmosphere, the award-winning cinemmatography of Werner Hoch.

And in my mind there is this vague picture of John Wayne and Joanna Dru( The young woman who is the romantic interest of the movie).

Most of the reviewers say that this is John Ford's masterpiece, and one of the greatest Westerns ever made.

My sense is movielovers can do a lot worse than giving their two hours to this particular film.",1150588800,3,1301,4.341563786008231
36040,2,0780621832,"I'd never seen this 1949 film.  And there it was, beckoning me from the shelf of the New York Public Library.  There are some urban myths about John Wayne but I don't remember any of his films.

So, hey, a long weekend was coming up.  I thought I might give it a try.

This story is about the U.S. Cavalry shortly after the Civil War.  General Custer and his men have just been slaughtered.  The Indians are uprising.  John Wayne, a gray-haired widower who visits his wife's grave regularly, is in command of a fort in the territory. In less than a week he will be forced into retirement. A romantic triangle exists between Joanne Dru and two of the enlisted men. She's visiting the fort but because danger is imminent, she and her aunt have to be escorted to where she can get a stagecoach.  So she goes out on patrol with the men.

I kept waiting for something to happen.  There was no real high drama.  Very little conflict.  John Wayne becomes the hero because he stops an Indian war by chasing away their horses.  Everything seems very unlikely.  And silly.  It was hard to keep watching because I was totally bored.  I guess John Wayne's performance was all right.  But I judge good performances on the subtlety of emotions displayed by the actors.  And John Wayne's performance was completely one-dimensional.

I've see old movies where the essentials of a good story are well told.  But, aside from the song, ""She Wore A Yellow Ribbon"", which has a catchy melody, this film just doesn't even make the playing field in my list of recommendations.

Don't waste your time with this one.  Just forgetaboutit!",1150070400,5,1612,4.578947368421052
36041,5,0780621832,"It's 1876, Gen. George Custer has just recently led the 7th Calvary to defeat at the Little Big Horn, and Capt. Nathan Brittles has less than a week to go until retirement.  Before then, though, he has one last mission - to escort the fort's commander's wife and niece to a rendezvous point with the stagecoach that will take the two women eastward to civilization and safety.  The trip won't be easy, though.  Emboldened by Custer's defeat, formerly warring tribes are gathering together and joining forces against the white intruders.

 John Wayne plays Brittles in John Ford's SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON, a big western with an elegantly clean and simple plot - get the women to the stage on time, get back to the fort alive. Much of the movie is played out against the backdrop of Monument Valley in Utah - the location most associated with Ford.  Photographer Winton Hoch won an Academy Award for color cinematography on this one.  Ford fills the cast with a number of regulars - besides Wayne, of course, there's Victor McLaglen as Sgt. Quincannon, comic relief and the biggest scene-stealer in the movie.  Joanne Dru plays the niece who `isn't army enough' to tough it out at the fort, while John Agar and Harry Carey Jr. play two young lieutenants who battle for her attention.  Ben Johnson, who'd win an Academy Award of his own for his role in `The Last Picture Show,' here plays a young sergeant on a fast horse, the scout who keeps track of the enemy (the party loses valuable time riding around, rather than through, the swiftly gathering foe.)

 There are a number of books on John Ford, and I risk repeating what I haven't yet read by going on too long about him.  One observation ought to suffice: Like most people I hate the hokey and the sugary sentimental, and I don't much care for directors who load their movies up with `em.  Ford, who may have been the most macho director ever to come out of Hollywood, had a depthless love for men under arms.  The horse soldiers in SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON are, typically, impossibly heroic and gallant.  For instance, when a wounded soldier is brought into camp, he is framed heroically (if that makes sense,) resting his wounded head in the arms of a comrade while he gives his report to Capt. Brittles.  Later, when we come upon a mortally wounded soldier, Ford tarries a while with him, not only giving him dying words to say, but a lengthy graveside service and burial.  It's all too romantic and idealized to accept.

 And yet every time I watch a Ford war movie - and they've all got scenes similar to this - I'm totally drawn in.  Against my better judgment Ford makes me see the heroes he sees, thrill at their bravery and mourn their loss side by side with him.  That has to be one definition of genius.  For my money, SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON is one of the better Wayne/Ford collaborations, and one that ought not be missed.",1146096000,5,2891,4.54054054054054

Wayne plays a cavalry captain about to grudgingly start retirement with two young competitive Lieutenants under his wing as an Indian uprising starts up requiring him to take action in the field for the last time. Adding to the tension is Agar as a First Lieutenant Career officer and Carey as a second lieutenant and short timer vying for Joanne Dru. Wayne does a very good job playing a captain in his late 50's struggling with early morning arthritis and dealing with McLaglen chronic drinking issues (virtually in every film). McLaglen plays his typical hard nosed, free drinking Irishman that plays the good sergeant in spite of his vice and penchant for fisticuffs. Along with that is Ben Johnson playing the familiar Sergeant role with as his running stock answer when asked a question by Wayne ""That's not my department"". Within the regrets of retirement and internal command conflicts, Wayne must take the field but he is burdened by women from the Fort that suddenly require an evacuation ruining Wayne's field maneuvers and causing injury to a patrol he cannot met timely. The picture becomes exciting as Wayne under constant pressure from Indians who now have up to date rifles from the typically 40's 50's portrayed of a lowdown dirty rotten sutler (Ford rarely put any in good light, see Fort Apache) as Wayne must hold off pursuit, split his command and return the women safely back to the Fort. The excitement continues with a touch of sentimentality that although prevalent in the film since Wayne is also a widower, he loses command due to forced retirement but without authorization, he unofficially returns to the field to assist Agar who is in the midst of his first independent campaign. This is an excellent portrayal of army life and in particular the running joke about being promoted in the post Civil War army in ""seven to ten years"". Dru serves well as the privileged but hard nosed romantic interest and at times slows the action, she also contributes to what appears to be some pre-matrimony squabbling that is not only entertaining but adds to the inner conflict of the command. Natwick, O'Brian and Shield s play their parts fine as well as the Ford pictures made them all stars.  The film also portrays the Indians in a positive light particularly showing their effective fighting methods, aversion to taking high casualties and the conflict between young and the old warriors. Collecting the trilogy is a must for all fans of Ford and Wayne.",1125187200,6,2881,4.9402061855670105

I especially liked it when they show the yellow legs walking their mounts while out in patrol. It also shows the loneiness of command and how hard it is to walk away from it. Altogether a grand movie, with some great acting, writing, scene location. I say Garry Owen and Good to Go!

36050,5,0780621832,"In my opinion John Wayne is the greatest of all actors in the western genre and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon shows Wayne at his best as Captain Nathan Brittles of the United States Cavalry attempting to quell an Indian uprising months after Custer and his troop have been killed at the Little Big Horn.  Think of all the great Westerns with John Wayne such as Red River The Searchers, Rio Lobo, and True Grit, to name just a few, and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon takes its place nicely in this list of fine films.

Alan Ladd in Shane remains my favorite western with Gary Cooper in High Noon second.  Yellow Ribbon's story is not as complex and compelling as either of the classics just named, but still it has much to recommend it.

First, the scenery is spectacular, as it was in Shane.  Monument Valley is the backdrop for the action and we see much of it as Wayne leads his troop to bring two women to a stagecoach at a not too distant outpost.  The hostiles have arrived first to destroy the outpost and Wayne is forced to take the women back to his post to remain for the winter.

Second, the acting is good, particularly Wayne and Victor McLaglen as his tough as nails, whiskey loving Sargeant.  Also, watch for a young Ben Johnson as Sgt. Tyree, a southern officer of the confederacy now enlisted in the U.S. Army.  Johnson is not as versatile an actor as Montgomery Clift, who rose to fame after Red River, but he is good enough to have had more than a career as a supporting player.

Third, the story, as mentioned, is a bit thin.  Wayne uses all his considerable savy to prevent an all out Indian war in the southwest.  Joanne Dru is an army brat being fought over by two young lieutenants to fill out the story line and this bickering, with Wayne in the middle to sort things out, gets a bit tiresome, as it did in Red River.  But it is Wayne we have come to see and he does not disappoint.  He invests his role with enough humanity for us to care about what happens to him as he closes out his career with the army.

She Wore a Yellow Ribbon gives us a simple, straightforward story in the best tradition of the American western.  Highly recommended.",1115251200,8,2155,4.323383084577115
36051,2,0780621832,"Watchable, but certainly not one of Ford or Wayne's best -- although very typical of their work together.

I would of course push you first toward ""The Searchers,"" but presumably you're aware of that immortal film.  Well, if you've gotta have one of Ford's ""cavalry"" movies, I would recommend instead ""Fort Apache,"" which can at least boast a memorable performance by Henry Fonda.

This particular movie is more of a straightforward Hollywood cowboys and Indians movie, without anything special to recommend it.

36052,4,0780621832,"This is the second in John Ford's cavalry trilogy. John Wayne is the cavalry officer who is about to retire, only decides to postpone it until trouble with the Indians can be resolved. All the Ford trademarks are in evidence, except in this case not Henry Fonda who added much to the prequel, FORT APACHE, the year before. The scenery (Monument Valley) is beautiful, and in color (and better than in the VHS), and the action rousing. But Ford is definitely shallow and weak in character portrayals, and a real sucker for cornball humor (the sloppy drunk, the coy mistress, etc.). I can't take very much of it.

36053,5,0780621832,"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon is the second movie in the John Ford cavalry trilogy and a great western overall.  In the months following the massacre at the Little Bighorn, all the Indians tribes throughout the west, Sioux, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache, are uniting to fight back and destroy the white population.  At Fort Starke, Captain Nathan Brittles has only six more days in the army before his retirement becomes official.  Before he can retire, Brittles must lead his cavalry troop on one last patrol to try and stop the coming Indian attack.  Simply put, this is one of the most beautiful westerns ever put on screen.  As expected with a John Ford western, the cinematography in Monument Valley is breathtaking with gorgeous vivid colors.  At the same time, the movie is a perfect example of a how a story should be told.  Ford takes his time developing the story, allowing the viewer to get to know the characters and enjoy the scenery of Monument Valley.  It goes without saying that if you like this movie, check out Fort Apache and Rio Grande.

  John Wayne gives one of his best performances as Captain Nathan Brittles, a retiring cavalry officer who must lead his troop on one more patrol.  Any movie fan that denies getting a little teary-eyed during the scene where Brittles addresses his company for the last time is lying.  Joanne Dru  plays Olivia Dandridge, a young Eastern woman traveling with the troop.  John Agar and Harry Carey JR play Lt. Flint Cohill and Lt. Ross Penell, the young officers vying for Miss Dandridge's attention.  In an excellent supporting role, Ben Johnson plays Sergeant Tyree, an ex-Confederate officer serving as the company's scout/point man.  Ford regular Victor McLaglen is equally as good as Sgt. Quincannon, the hard-drinking veteran and friend of Brittles who is also retiring.  The movie also stars George O'Brien, Mildred Natwick, and Arthur Shields.  The DVD offers a beautifully remastered standard presentation, production notes, a brief 4-minute home video with the Duke and Ford scouting locations, and a theatrical trailer.

As my love of cinema was slowly nurtured ""She Wore A Yellow Ribbon"" left an indelible impression on my psyche.  I loved every bit of it.  The odyessic story, with its lack of 'white man good' 'red indian bad' stereotyping.  The sophistication of Ford's direction with its cool appreciation of America's big country.  The actors - Wayne, of course, towering above all, and decades before he blotted his copybook with his embarrasing gung-ho roles, to Victor McLagen's 'Oirish' knockabout sargeant, via the under-stated work of Joanne Dru and John Agar.

I go further in claiming for it high status in the genre of western films, it is one of the finest. Wayne wears makeup that ages him 20 years and his acting performance transforms him into that older man Captain Nathan Brittles, soon to be retired from the U. S. Cavalry. Captain Brittles talking to his late wife at her grave ,while he waters the plants he has placed there, with Monument valley in the background is one of the more moving scenes.  This and ""The Searchers"" are Wayne's finest acting performances. ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" won an academy award for it's color cinematography and it was well deserved. This is one beautiful film. Ford shot many of his westerns in Monument valley, this is his definitive Monument valley western, you really see alot of the landscape and clouds and it's glorious.

After years in the U.S. Cavalry it is all he knows and is not sure what will become of him when he leaves it. Brittles knows that the Army and life will go on, but what will his role in life be, since he lost his wife years before. This is the second and best film in the John Ford cavalry trilogy. As it Brittles is not very keen on handing over command to younger soldiers who are yet to prove themself in leading other men and in combat. For all it's worth he has little to no say about what will happen to those who take over and what will become of the indian tribe that he has worked with and delt with for so long. Victor McLaglen is a great supporter in the film as he also faces retirement and enjoys his whiskey and fights along with the other men. A story about trust and service along with changing times, it features one of Wayne's best performances. An Oscar winner for best color cinematography (Winton C. Hoch) that features Monument Valley, this is a film to see as it is a western and war film wraped into one. It is simple yet not boring and it get's to the point when needed.

36062,4,0780621832,"For whatever reasons, Wayne's performances in westerns tend to be of a higher quality than in his other films and that is especially true of his work in this film, based on two of James Warner Bellah's short stories. Wayne portrays Captain Nathan Brittles who is about to retire. As the last day of his command approaches, Brittles must meanwhile cope with an Apache uprising which even his longtime friend Chief Pony That Walks (Chief John Big Tree) cannot prevent. One sub plot involves two young lieutenants who compete for Olivia Dandridge (Joanne Dru). One is Flint Cohill played by John Agar who appeared previously in Fort Apache as Lieutenant Michael O'Rourke. Other members of the John Ford Repertory Players include Victor McLaglen, Mildred Natwick, Arthur Shields, Harry Carey, Jr., and Ben Jonson who is especially effective as Sergeant Tyree.
Frankly, I dislike westerns shot in color. Also, John Ford apparently had problems when directing actresses. (Maureen O'Hara's performance in The Quiet Man is a stunning exception.) More often than not, Ford's female characters are presented as saints, children, or furniture. I would have much preferred that this film had been shot in black-and-white, that the Olivia Dandridge character be omitted, and that the film focus entirely on the completion of Brittles' last command. Wayne is absolutely brilliant when Brittles is presented with a gold watch from his troops and struggles withy his eyeglasses so that he can read the inscription, ""Lest We Forget."" His conversation with Chief Pony That Walks in the Apache camp is also memorable. Wayne has better material to work with in this film than he had in Fort Apache (1948). In my opinion, his performance is flawless. Nevertheless, I rate this film a notch or two below Fort Apache and Rio Grande in which Ford is much less self-indulgent.",1060128000,5,1851,5.092105263157895
36063,5,0780621832,"""She Wore A Yellow Ribbon"" is one of those glorious westerns, luminously photographed by director, John Ford.  It stars, John Wayne, as a widower living at a military outpost with the cavalry and features some of the most gorgeously photographed exteriors ever captured on film.  Monument Valley becomes a place of quiet, stoic beauty and the duke never gave a more impressive performance than he does here.
My hat off to the good people at Warner Home Video.  This is a truly amazing looking DVD and one that should definitely be on every film buffs wish list to own.  Colors are fully saturated, well balanced and incredibly life like.  Contrast levels are on pitch as are black levels.  There is a hint of edge enhancement and pixelization but really - it's just a hint.  Chips, scratches and imperfections inherant in the original camera negative are kept to a bare, bare minimum.  The audio is mono, as originally presented, but extremely well balanced, with low to non-existant background hiss in most scenes.  No extras: a shame!  One craves a documentary on either the making-of this movie or John Ford himself.  We get neither.  Still, it's hard to fault such a near pristine looking transfer.

36065,5,0780621832,"John Ford's ""Cavalry Trilogy"" presents some of the finest western scenes ever made. I believe this to be the best of the three, although I'm sure to hear from folks who differ. Be that as it may, this is a beautifully made disc. On the big screen ( a must), it is the scenery that is a major factor, because the film is so vivid. I saw the ""Trilogy"" in the theatre when released, and I believe that the DVD viewer will see the film better realized on the digital screen than moviegoers saw in 1959. Another opinion that many will differ with is that this is John Wayne's best performance; his role as Captain Nathan Briddles could not be better done. John Ford had a cadre of actors that appeared regularly in his films, but Victor McLaglin, Ben Johnson and Arthur Shields do good work in their respective parts. Johnson, a former rodeo rider, is a superb horseman, and watch Shields' stagecraft when his character operates on a wounded trooper. It's fantastic attention to the details of the scene. Joanne Dru was a fifties actress, and the love interest is a bit dated, but it is the cinematography that is the winner here. Some of the scenes, one involving a thunderstorm, and another showing a stunning sunset are still amazing, especially since no computer graphics are involved. The attention to detail that makes or breaks historical film are consistantly well done here, as exemplified in the correctness of the cavalry scenes. Back in 1959, there were people around who knew what horse soldiering was, and it is painstakingly recreated here.

His convincing performance of a man 20+ years his actual age should've gotten him the Oscar. Another great feature of this film is the cinematography-which DID get the Oscar. Couple this with the beautiful restoration work that was done for this DVD and you have a film that almost looks like it was made yeaterday-especially the outdoor shots!

36068,4,0780621832,"Joanne Dru teams with The DUKE again in this Technicolor marvel (after appearing together in ""Red River"" the year before). In this one, Dru plays a young romantic hopeful for both John Agar and Harry Carey, Jr.
Monument Valley never looked better. The stormclouds are stunning, even if the fake lightning is not. And the sunsets! Only Technicolor can capture the colors with such brilliance!
While I prefer ""Rio Grande"" and the lamentably-not-on-DVD-yet ""Fort Apache"", ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" plays more as a quiet homage to the cavalry than the actionfests of the other two films. Not that this film is sparse on action! However, the focus here is most definitely on the honor and wisdom of the old guard.
As usual, Ford has many subtle threads woven in to the plot of the film that enhance the story with backstories that are only hinted at. The most notable of these is the former Confederate soldiers, now part of the U.S. Cavalry. Their honor is intact, and they are still true to their ideals, despite wearing the uniform of the Yankee. There is, we know, much more to their story, but we see just what we need to. Any more, and the real story would get lost, the focus moved to the wrong place. How many modern directors make the mistake of letting this happen again and again and again? Too many, for sure.
Some people have complained that John Wanye was a lousy actor, which I've always chalked up to a refusal to recognize talent in a celebrity simply through differences in personal taste. Like ""The Searchers"", ""Red River"", ""The Horse Soldiers"" and ""The Sands of Iwo Jima"" (also starring the late John Agar), there are solid moments in this film when DUKE delivers. Just look as he ""gives his report"" to his wife and children, when he writes out his protest to his commanding officer, and again, when he gets the memento of the silver watch from his troopers. The viewer's taste notwithstanding, it cannot be denied that DUKE could act.
The usual excellent Ford supporting players abound. Ben Johnson, Arthur Shields, Harry Carey Jr., and of course, the lovable Victor McLaglen (yet again playing a man named Quincannon), are all on hand. Paul Fix has a cameo as a gun-runner.
Two real-life Indian chiefs also appear. Chief John Big Tree appeared in several westerns (including ""The Big Trail"" and ""Stagecoach"", both with The DUKE), and is famous for being the original model for artist James Fraser when he crafted the indian head nickel. Chief Sky Eagle cameos in his only film appearance.
A touching and poignant western, it is a must see for fans of Ford, The DUKE, The U.S. Calvalry, or the Old West.

The old cavalry captain at the end of a long career, a Civil War veteran trying to get a job done in a lonely part of the world, a widower still in love with his wife, a gentleman of the old school, and more, this is John Wayne in a truly great role. In addition to him, this movie has some of the best directing, photography, and music of any western film. Maybe The Searchers is arguably the best western ever made, and I would not argue that, but She Wore A Yellow Ribbon is the one that makes you want to stand up and cheer (just like Joanne Dru said). Captain Nathan Brittles takes care of his soldiers, mentors the young officers (a phrase overused and little heeded in today's Army), and finally accomplishes his mission, but not without some great drama and disappointment along the way. If nothing else, people should watch this movie for the photography and camera work. Watch the bugler as he rides along in silence beside his Captain; watch how he sits his horse. And watch Ben Johnson in an early role. There is one picture of him on his sorrel horse against the sky that should have been a painting. I do enjoy this movie, as anyone can tell. I do so because it has all the right elements: danger, romance, drama, a surprise and exciting ending, along with the music and photography.

Other reviewers have commented on the relative weakness of performances by the younger players:  I think that fits one of his themes, as the inexorable passage of time forces the older generation to yield to not-quite-ready callow youths.
One reviewer complained that this DVD was released in a TV ratio, and advised us to wait for the widescreen version.  In 1949, when this movie was released, there was no widescreen.

36073,5,0780621832,"That's the line Captain Nathan Brittles (John Wayne) keeps repeating at different junctures throughout this John Ford classic of a retiring cavalry officer and the last mission he must preside over.
But although Brittles may not hold with apologizing, we see that his life has had many ups and downs, and will have more before this mission is complete. He and his men must escort his commander's wife and her niece to catch the stage back east, a task made dangerous because of the recent massacre of Custer at the Little Big Horn. There are two storylines at work here: a love triangle of the niece who's playing off two young soldiers against each other, and Brittles' more engrossing story as the old officer tries to carry out this last mission in a world where young blood continually stirs up trouble on the warpath--literally.
Wayne does one of his best jobs here, playing a man much older than his actual age. One wonders what he might have done differently had ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" come later in his career, in the 1960s or early 70s. Nevertheless, even though the picture was 25 years ahead of schedule for Wayne, he does a convincing portrayal of the timeworn captain who understands that there is little of glory in the calvary, but much honor if you do your duty. Frequent co-star Victor McLaglin is on hand again, this time as Sgt. Quincannon, also due for retirement in the next few days. This is one of those ""stage Irish"" performances, more than slightly over the top, replete with whiskey drinking and brawling, but not troublesome for all that.
Ford rarely handles women convincingly, and Joanne Dru is no exception. She looks more like a 1940s WAC than a 19th century girl visiting the still-untamed West, but Harry Carey Jr and John Agar aren't much help either. Of the younger crowd, the best job is turned in by Ben Johnson, that master horseman who populated not a few of the Ford calvary pictures. He playes Sgt. Tyree, a former Confederate captain who now is an enlisted man in the calvary. This speaks to the uneasy attempt to meld together two armies lately at war with each other, who now must unite to bring the west and the Indians down under US government authority.
There are three major factors that make ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" a standout:
One is John Wayne's performance. The second is the Nathan Brittles storyline. The third?
Absolutely breathtaking cinematography. One knows that this picture's Best Cinematography Oscar was won by just one scene--that amazing storm gathering cloud threatening down on the the calvary as they march through Monument Valley. There are other good shots, but that's the Award-winner, no doubt about that.
For those who think that all westerns are the same, make it your business to watch ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" to correct that misconception--and no apologies, please; it's a sign of weakness.",1022716800,,2875,4.798387096774194
36074,5,0780621832,"This is actually my favorite film, so I am biased. When I was young, it was a good action picture; now I see so much more. It's not just the US cavalry who are the good guys. It demands respect of the Indians at a time when so many films were less so, to say the least. At the same time, it seeks to unite North and South with the relationship between Brittles and Tyree, most poigniantly with the death of Trooper Smith ""late Brigadier-General of the Confederate army"". Since the picture has been cleaned up, it's stunning to look at too.
By the way, it's a silver watch...",1021248000,3,574,4.275229357798165
36075,2,0780621832,"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon is great for the scenery, for some sense of the cavalry and for anyone who likes to see galloping horses and an old-fashioned bar-brawl in a film.  It is not exactly what you would call a psychological film however.  I found it surprisingly boring, considering its high acclaim and description as John Wayne's greatest acting feat.  The film has no depth:  the characters are very simplistic, hardly going beyond a two or three line description:  the handsome rival, the rich rival, the hard-drinking Irishman.  If you don't have a longing for the cavalry, you aren't going to enjoy this film.",1020988800,4,618,4.838095238095238
36076,5,0780621832,"Both Howard Hawks and John Ford understood that the older they became,
the more important male friendships were to them.
This is one of the best examples from Ford.  The film has a warmth
and unmistakable magical quality to its sense of humor.  It bears
up very well under repeated viewings and the relationship between
John Wayne and Victor McLaglen is just the best.  Wayne's character
exhibits a maturity and wisdom here that is very moving.  It helps
to have seen a little of life before viewing this film.  But, then,
that is true of all of John Ford's and Howard Hawks' work.
You just have to have lived life to appreciate it in their films.
One of my favorites and every bit the equal to ""Rio Bravo.""
It's the perfect film to watch while enjoying a rare New York steak
and a good bottle of red wine.",1020124800,,806,4.418918918918919

7789802,5,0780621832,"An absolute classic. A masterpiece.
It has aged. Its slow paced and very square by todays standards. Keep that in mind.
John Wayne playing his typical screen character: in charge, gutsy, daring, mocking the younger guys...
director John Ford at his best. Many of his loose stock company of actors are here. All shine. Everyone turns is a very good performance 
The color, the shots of the west and monument valley...! Wow! She Wore A Yellow Ribbon won the 1950 Academy Award for Cinematography. Youll see why.
Now, as for the dvd. There are a lot out there. Get the lastest release from Warners. Do not buy an older copy.
Watch it on some special night when you are in the mood for a classic. No interruptions permitted. Big screen, lights off! Youll see real film making. Breath taking scenes. Youll me in awe.",1523750400,,811,4.631944444444445
