7657216,4,B01BIEHMMK,"Nice duo of giallos that might not be top of the crop but have all the genre mainstays to make them irresistible for fans, from utter stylishness and sexy bits to enjoyably convoluted plots and a fair amount of nastiness. Sure, neither film lives up to Dario Argento or Mario Bava's best - but they're great enjoyment all the same!!!",1465344000,,333,4.566666666666666
7657217,4,B01BIEHMMK,"Killer Dames is a 4-disc set of two feature films directed by Emilio P. Miraglia. The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave (1971) takes place in England, where Alan Cunningham (Anthony Steffen) is a wealthy aristocrat recently released from a mental institution. Haunted by the death of his first wife, Evelyn, he tries to move on by marrying the seductive Gladys (Marina Malfatti). Soon, however, several relatives meet untimely and gruesome deaths, leading to speculation that a vengeful Evelyn has risen from the grave.

In The Red Queen Kills Seven Times (1972), an ancient family curse falls on sisters Kitty (Barbara Bouchet) and Franziska (Marina Malfatti) following the death their grandfather Tobias (Rudolf Schundler). According to the curse, every hundred years the bloodthirsty Red Queen returns and claims seven fresh victims.

Both films fall within the Italian giallo genre  lurid murder mysteries with considerable female flesh on view. Their heyday was the early 1970s. The films in this box set contain a number of gruesome scenes and escalating suspense. Acting is not the best, but the style carries the day. Production design, the use of color, and atmospheric locations all contribute to an eerie mood. Both films are unrated and in the widescreen format.

There is an incredible amount of bonus material in the set, including alternate openings, archival interviews with Barbara Bouchet, Lorenzo Baralsi, Marino Masse, and Erika Blanc; new interview with Sybil Danning; new audio commentary; original Italian and English soundtracks; reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned art work; and a limited edition 60-page booklet containing details of production, critical evaluation and background on the giallo genre.",1463961600,10,1752,5.453874538745388
7657218,4,B01BIEHMMK,"A giallo double-feature that represents everything good - and bad - about the sexy Italian mystery genre, Arrow Video's Killer Dames set collects two films by director Emilio Miraglia:  The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave and The Red Queen Kills Seven Times.  Ridiculously over plotted in that charming way only gialli seem to be able to pull off, both movies mix gothic elements with more modern slasher touches - and a welcome bit of skin - to generate maximum audience appeal.  While one detects a whiff of desperation from time to time, Miraglia approaches the material like a ""Giallo Greatest Hits"" collection, mixing and matching to create his own murderous playlist.

The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave (1971) introduces a bit of the supernatural in its story of the mentally unstable Lord Cunningham (Anthony Steffen) whose guilt over the death of his unfaithful red-headed wife, Evelyn, leads him to lure a slew of similar red-heads to his secret torture chamber.  While his wealth lets him avoid any prosecution, his illness gets harder to hide after a whirlwind marriage to Gladys (Marina Malfatti) prompts even more frequent visions of his dead bride rising from her tomb.  Is it an actual haunting...or is someone after his substantial inheritance?

Evelyn splits the difference between Gothic ingredients (castles, ghosts, secret rooms) and more traditional giallo thrills pretty evenly.  There's quite a bit of Bava's The Whip and the Body referenced here in Lord Cunningham's basement pleasure palace, but Miraglia lets it all hang out with copious amounts of nudity.  And the film's elaborate murder sequences - including a rather pointless snake attack and the grisly disposal of another body fed to a pack of foxes living on the estate - are typical showy exploitation fare, far removed from the subtle mysteries of Hitchcock's Rebecca.

Yet it's this wishy-washy plotting that keeps the film interesting, despite that fact that it lacks any sympathetic character to latch onto.  Add in some slow-motion flashbacks, an interrupted sance, a handful of red herrings and a striptease artist whose act involves emerging from an ornate coffin and you've got a giallo that may never connect all the dots but still offers two hours of pleasant distraction.

The Red Queen Kills Seven Times (1972) skews more towards a predictable body count picture involving a family curse, squabbling siblings and a grandfather's will.  Kitty (Barbara Bouchet) and her sister Evelyn have hated each other since childhood, a scenario that seems to fulfill a family prophecy involving one sister's death followed by her ghostly revenge.  And, indeed, the prophecy seems to prove all too real when Kitty's accidental murder of her sister leads to unexplained murders by a woman dressed in red.

The film's plot is muddled from the get-go, adding another sister, Franziska (Marina Malfatti, again) into the mix and a host of potential suspects / victims at the fashion design house where they all work.  Once more a Bava film comes to mind - this time Blood and Black Lace - but Red Queen takes some unusual left turns including a Phantom of the Opera-style finale involving a flooded castle passageway and hundreds of waterlogged rats.  Bouchet's character is asked to do little more that widen her eyes in shock on command and, beyond a quick nude scene from co-star Sybil Danning, this one is light on sex appeal as well.  But the score by Bruno Nicolai, which revolves around a childhood tune much like Argento's Deep Red would use three years later, is catchy to the point of distraction.

Miraglia's films almost demand a 10-page flowchart, but logic was certainly never a big part of the giallo's appeal.  Both titles fit comfortably in the ""above-average"" category - with transfers that are well above the curve - and Arrow's Blu-ray / DVD combo is an obvious upgrade from the previous NoShame set from 2006 (whose extras are ported over here under the archive section).  Evelyn comes with a commentary from giallo author Troy Howarth and interview with critic Stephen Thrower that combine to shed light on the confusing plot points.  Also included is an exclusive interview with co-star Erika Blank and the aforementioned archival extras.

Red Queen adds another commentary (this time from Alan Jones and Kim Newman) to match up with Stephen Thrower's on-camera analysis, plus an alternate opening, theatrical trailers and new interview with Sybil Danning, who still looks marvelous!  Both films come with a reversible sleeve featuring new artwork by Gilles Vranckx.",1463270400,13,4575,5.077436582109479

8750313,5,B01BIEHMMK,"*I received a review copy of this set in exchange for an honest review

The giallo genre is a subset of horror that Ive only recently discovered.  I knew what it was, but I hadnt had the pleasure of watching any of the films until just a year or so ago.  It is a fascinating grouping of movies, though, that contain hybrids of several different genres.  The two films in the KILLER DAMES film collection are giallo mysteries, and they are both exquisite examples of why I enjoy the genre so much.  Chocked full of intrigue and horror, THE NIGHT EVEYLN CAME OUT FROM THE GRAVE and THE RED QUEEN KILLS SEVEN TIMES are must-haves for your movie library!

Seems like I mention this often when Im talking about Arrow Video and MVD Distribution, but I absolutely love the obscure titles they find to release.  Not only do they add to my movie knowledge, but these titles are also vastly entertaining.

Both films in the KILLER DAMES set are shot well and look great onscreen.  The 2K restorations look stunning, and therefore the picture quality ranks up there with some of the best refurbishments Ive seen.  Likewise, the sound quality is great as well.  Both films rocked on my surround sound.

The films themselves are interesting and fun to watch.  I never got bored, and I found myself enthralled with both stories.  For being 40+ years old, the mystery in each movie is engaging and kept me guessing.

My favorite film of the two has to be THE NIGHT EVELYN CAME OUT OF THE GRAVE.  This one made me reevaluate my assumptions as to who the killer was several times.  And the ending has a couple of nice twists I didn't see coming.  At the end, when the credits rolled, I sat there with a grin on myself.  It is truly a satisfying movie experience.

KILLER DAMES is an excellent set, and I highly recommend adding it to your movie collection.  In addition to some great vintage giallo horror, youll get a nice dose of intrigue and even a hint of some decent gore.  This set is available now, so make a note.",1466035200,6,2004,4.462809917355372
8750314,4,B01BIEHMMK,"The following review was originally write for my website Mind of Tatlock. The product was provided for review.

Arrow Video is making my life hard. They keep releasing these loaded boxsets and I spend hours scouring through the features and the movies, just to give my useless opinion on something that is clearly going to be a winner for the fans. Killer Dames is a loaded box set featuring two movies: The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave and The Red Queen Kills Seven Times, plus its got a ton of special features and a wonderfully massive booklet to read. Fans of Italian Gothic Giallos are going to be in heaven with this release. As for yours truly, I was a bit disappointed with one of the movies, but the other flick made up for it with a stellar murder mystery. If you're interested in seeing what the set includes and which movie I liked, read on

The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave

The first movie to crack into is The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave. Its a bit of a slow burn Italian Giallo, mixed with a healthy dose of gothic themes. It tells the story of Alan Cunningham (Anthony Steffen), a man who has an unhealthy fetish for beating up hot redheads. Why he does this is a because his recently deceased redheaded wife was cheating on him and he caught her in the act. This naughty act pushes him over the edge and now he is off his rocker. Because he is a rich dude, everyone wants a piece of the money pie and they begin scheming, backstabbing and double crossing. Throw in some supernatural bits here and there and you got yourself The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave.

The biggest issue I had with The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave was the fact that it took a long time to get to the good stuff. Eventually, when stuff starts happening, the ending cliche freeze frame rolls around and the movie is over. The movie does have a few mysterious deaths going for it and a twist here and there for sure, but its the boring (to me anyway) trip that makes it hard to recommend the flick. I did enjoy the ample supply of nudity thrown at me, which is always a big plus in my dirty book, but I just wish there was more going on with the plot. The atmosphere is definitely there, with a stellar Castle set piece that screams gothic horror, but even that isn't utilized properly. In the end, the movie lands on a flat note.

The Red Queen Kills Seven Times:

To make up for the disappointment I had with The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave, the next flick in the box set is the stellar The Red Queen Kills Seven Times. This time around, the film is definitely more giallo, with a gloved mysterious murderer on the loose, dispatching people in bloody ways. Plus, Sybil Danning bares it all, which manages to get the heart racing even faster.

The plot for The Red Queen Kills Seven Times goes a little something like this: The legend goes that two rivaling sisters, known as the Red Queen and the Black Queen, will end up in a deadly game that results in the Black Queen killing the Red Queen. However, the Red Queen will rise from the grave to kill six innocent people, with the seventh person being the Black Queen. This curse has run in the Wildenbrck family for centuries with Kitty and Evelyn being the next set of siblings that the curse will happen too. We jump ahead years to see that a mysterious lady in red is offing people connected to Kitty and she thinks it could be her sister doing the killing, but how can it be when Evelyn is in fact already dead! Is tonight the night Evelyn comes out of the grave? (Oops, wrong movie.)

Okay, thats a pretty half-assed plot breakdown, but I don't want to spoil the fun of figuring out the movie for yourselves. Its certainly a trip to see everything unfold, even if come the end, half of it doesnt make sense  a problem with a lot of giallo films.

The Red Queen Kills Seven Times was my favourite, mainly due to the more effective giallo story and a nice helping of gore and nudity. It certainly kept me intrigued to the very end, making me stick with it to figure out who the killer was. Plus, Sybil Danningdamnnnnn!

Blu-ray Opinion:

Wow is all I can say when talking about the Blu-ray Box-set from Arrow Video. The Killer Dames collection comes in a hard case box, with a massive and highly informative booklet. Each movie comes on its own disc, with a separate case and reversible sleeve. The video for both films is the usual Arrow Video quality, which means damn impressive. The reds in The Red Queen Kills Seven Times pop and dark scenes in The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave are perfectly black. Honestly, a superb job on the video. As for the audio, you have two options: Italian and English. Both choices give you some laughable dubbing, so its hard to say which is the best version to listen to. I did go back and forth with the audio and both of them sounded great.

The special features for The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave features interviews with Arrow fan favorite Stephen Thrower, who is always a delight to listen to. There is also an interview with Erika Blanc. Thrown on top of the wonderful interviews is some more archival interviews with the production designer Lorenzo Baraldi and another old interview with Erika Blanc. There is a lot to go through and its all fantastic.

The special features for The Red Queen Kills Seven Times also feature some informative interviews, with my favourite being the one with Sybil Danning. Like the previous disc, there is also lots of archival interviews to go through. Lots and lots of goodies to digest.

Verdict:

Killer Dames features one okay movie and one awesome movie. Of course, this is going to be different for everybody. However, the good thing about the box set is the awesome special features for both movies. This allows everyone to get something worthwhile when plunking down the cash. My verdict? Killer Dames from Arrow Video is definitely the gothic-giallo youve been craving.",1466035200,,5948,4.44811753902663
8750315,5,B01BIEHMMK,"A magnanimous thank you for Arrow remastering Red Queen.  With an amazing soundtrack by Bruno Nicolai, this film is one of the top Giallo films ever for me.  Lots of well framed shots and stunning Gothic backdrops and a captivating story; and of course, the inimitable Red Queen with her cackling, creepy laugh.  The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave is too slow and dry for me and the male lead has barely any affect to his performance no matter what was transpiring and really didn't encapsulate a character that seemed unstable or had a severe mental illness.  Still, there is some worthwhile camp and some cool scenes here and there if the viewer can be patient with it.  I hope Arrow puts out more Sergio Martino on blu ray too!",1465516800,3,734,4.53030303030303
