8553746,4,B00AMHFOPW,The Darkest Corner of Paradise is a great movie. I was really surprised and impressed. When an indie movie is hitting on all cylinders there's nothing quite like it. This is excellent from beginning to end; a great piece of work.,1374710400,,229,4.609756097560975
8553747,5,B00AMHFOPW,"This film is the reason I watch indie films.  Everything about it works (acting, script, directing, editing, camera work) and it is fresh.  The use of cello with no dialog, shot in black and white, and the sound tracks, especially ""Voices from Hell"" written and performed by Sawyer Family (music video on you tube). Looking forward to seeing more from director Henry Weintraub.",1365552000,,377,4.968253968253968
