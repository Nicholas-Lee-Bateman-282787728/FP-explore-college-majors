7885845,5,630519811X,"Mendel is a young Jewish boy growing up after the war. His parents have secrets and his dad and older brother have nightmares and scream in the night. Still, when Mendel asks, nobody wants to tell him much. Mendel asks about the number tattoos some of the adults have on their arms, and he asks if he will get one too when he grows up. He also wonders why his dad is so upset about the Germans, and why some of the adults do not like Santa Claus and Christmas carols. And then there are the conversations that end and the photos that are hidden every time Mendel approaches.

The young boy has many questions, that the adults are reluctant to answer. His parents and another Jewish couple show strong emotions to some of the things he does; like when Mendel and a friend draw numbers on their arms, so they can be the same as their parents. Mendel does not quite understand why.

The adult generation is reluctant to answer Mendel's questions because they want to shield their children from the horrible past. At the same time it is not easy to be a child, and hear fragments of his parents' conversations.

I loved this film. It was well made and despite the fact that it is bringing up many serious and important issues, I found a lot of funny segments in ""Mendel"".",1121472000,2,1267,4.405982905982906
