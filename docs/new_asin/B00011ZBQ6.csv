8005618,5,B00011ZBQ6,I own up to this one and am in the process of buying them all. They seem to get better as they go along. The only down fall is that some dvd are longer then others but they're all still really good.,1141776000,,198,3.738095238095238
8005619,5,B00011ZBQ6,"To basically start this off I'll start with the obvious, well Genjomaden Saiyuki is one of the most comical, entertaining, and certainly up with the best. I personally love this anime. There's a lot of DVDs and as far as I do I beleive that there are 18 DVDs total. Of course only up to 9 came come out and we all eagerly awaiting March 30th aren't we? Well at least I am. Saiyuki is about Demons and Humans living in Shangrila (let me know if I spelled it wrong; I'm not in the mood to look it up)together and I know this 7th DVD, well the Demons get all uncontrolable and attack humans while these gods come along and such, the god of war. Well the Sanzo gang consists of Son Goku (Demon), Genjo Sanzo of course, Sha Goyjo (Half water Demon), and last but never least Cho Hakkai (He killed 100 Demons which turned him into one). Basically that concludes my ranting... if any of you actsually read this, thank you!^^ Any questions e-mail: warrior.killua@verizon.net,
Arigato!

8005620,5,B00011ZBQ6,"We have reached the 'second season' point in this series.  While the first year was a time of picaresque journeying on a quest to stop the resurrection of an ancient evil, this season starts off on a much different tack.  Something is awry in heaven, and suddenly gods are walking the earth.  Gods with large chips on their shoulders, looking for the sacred scriptures in order to bring down heaven's walls.
The leader is Homura, the God of War.  He is a matched opponent for Genjo Sanzo with a in deadpan style and classic bishonen good looks, and nearly impossible to defeat.  He lacks Sanzo's moral fiber and ability to trade bon mots, but his almost lackadaisical cruelty makes the perfect contrast.  He seems to know the priest from some former life in heaven, but that mystery has yet to unfold.  In the meantime, Homura and his two companions. Zenon and Shien make life pretty grim for the fab four.
After the initial confrontation, Homura heads off to Houtou castle to take the Seiten scripture for his own and foil Gyokumen Koushu's plan to raise his father.  Meanwhile Sanzo, Goku, Gojyo, and Hakkai enjoy a short respite for brawling, arguing, letching, and, of course, eating.  They are brought up short when they encounter another of Homura's servants, the Undertaker.  Then it is very nearly death by neat freak.
Until this point Saiyuki has been a battle among equals, with more emphasis on the lives and interactions of its unlikely heroes than real advance of the overall story arc.  Now this complex approach to some major confrontation is a fascinating change of pace, coming at just the moment when viewer interest might begin to lag.  Art, acting, and music remain at a high standard and there is no sign of sophomore slump.  Saiyuki's deviation from classic anime role models continues to make it one of the strongest entries in modern adult anime.",1077667200,,1870,4.788161993769471
8005621,5,B00011ZBQ6,"Ah Saiyuki Season 2!
Three new characters show up.  The war prince Homura (voice acted by none less than Jason Douglas, he also was the English voice of Lord Illpilatzo from Excel Saga, he always gets casted for the world conqueror bit doesn?t he?), and his two minions Zenon and Shien descend to start a rebellion against the heavens.  Now it looks like there is a three way race to get Scriptures now?
This Disk features FOUR new adventures for the Sanzo party and their enemies.
Episode 27: Basic Introduction of Homura and his minions? Homura calls the Sanzo party by their past life names, destroys literally truckloads of Demons with but a thought, and Sanzo?s gun has no effect on Homura.
Most notable seen: Sanzo?s introduction about the ?If you meet the Buddha kill the Buddha?
Episode 28: Homura starts to gather demon followers, he apparently can turn demons into ?gods?.  The Merciful Goddess refuses to do anything to stop Homura, says that watching Homura will keep her from being bored for awhile.  Apparently Homura is the half human son of the Jade Emperor? the gods will do nothing to stop him as they have grown lazy and fat.  Sanzo?s party has to share a single room and draws cards to see who gets the bed while the others sleep on the floor. The episode ends with an  attack on Houtou Castle to get the Seiten Scripture.  Most notable scenes: The first meeting of Sanzo (of God Sanzo) and Son Goku.  Goku and Gojyo  fight over the bed and the innkeeper walks in and sees them in a rather embarrassing situation.
Episode 29: Homura and gang assault Houtou Castle.  Homura single handedly bests both Dokugakuji and Kougaiji.  Dr. Ni (that crazy scientist with the stuffed bunny) just hands over the Seiten Scripture to Homura in hopes that he will leave Lady Koushu and the rest with their lives.  Sonzo gets a rude awaking from the merciful Goddess, who reminds him of the Teachings of his Master.  The ?if you meet the Buddha kill the Buddha? which has been said at least 3 times in the series now?  Zenon kills a demon who killed his human wife.  Basically this episode was to show that these new characters are in fact a force to be reckoned with.
Most Notable scene: Sanzo tries to shoot the Merciful Goddess? and fails.?
Episode 30:  Homura sends his latest Assassin to kill the Sanzo party to get the Scripture that Sanzo carries.  This demon makes a village into a ghost town, his ?Perfect Paradise?.  He calls himself the Undertaker, and puts the entire Sanzo party through all kinds of physiological torture.  Basically Puts a plate of food in front of a hungry Goku to only make it disappear a second later.  Deprives Gojyo of women and alcohol .  Burns Hakuryu to get Hakki upset, and gently just pisses Sanzo off with the whole ordeal of things going on. They basically best him and go on their merry way.  Most notable scene, Gojyo practically begs Sanzo for a smoke, and Sanzo reminds him that he said ?You said my smokes tasted like Crap.""
Basically this DVD has the basic ADV basics, a new opening theme and animation, new closing theme and animation, but no longer gives you any previews of upcoming episodes.
Like all the other volumes of Saiyuki they give a wonderful Culture references from the ?Journey to the West? and other Japanese jokes you hear while listing to the Japanese audio.  Also this series is best kept in context with the Japanese audio as the English seems to completely warp it at times? all in all a good DVD for Saiyuki fans.  And also the fact that you can?t go wrong with Zenon, how cool is a god with an AK?",1073779200,,3572,4.571428571428571
8005622,5,B00011ZBQ6,"The second season of Gensoumaden Saiyuki opens with three new adversaries for our four heroes, who bring with them a new wave of tantalizing clues about the past. What our three new villains -- the War Prince Homura (pictured on the cover) and his divine minions Zenon and Shuei -- know could change everything about the lives and mission of Sanzo, Hakkai, Gojyo and Goku.
This new season begins with the philosophy that Sanzo has recited before: ""If you meet the Bhudda, kill the Bhudda. ... Live your life just as it is."" However, that philosophy is becoming more difficult to uphold. Not only are the four journeyers visited by the three gods mentioned before, but the Merciful Goddess (large-breasted and dryly hilarious Kanzeon Bosatsu) herself comes down to talk to Sanzo. We learn through a series of flashbacks, a monologue from Homura and the deductive skills of Hakkai that all four heroes once had other names and other lives, five hundred years ago. Golden-haired god Konzen makes a brief appearance to illustrate his first meeting with the much more animalistic Goku, but Hakkai and Gojyo's past incarnations are only briefly mentioned.
Bringing in the facts of the characters' past lives, while shrouding the details in shadows and leaving many mysteries to be unravelled, makes this disc my all-around favorite of the series so far. Also, at least on the Japanese track, the jokes and dialogue have become a lot funnier! The contrast of very silly scenes and darkly serious scenes make this disc a lot of fun to watch.
The only bad part is that the animation has clearly started to suffer in this second season. Middle- and far-distance shots are often drawn pretty badly, out of proportion and with shaky lines. But at least the close-ups are still great!
If the rest of the discs continue like this one, I'm going to like the second season even more than the first.",1073606400,,1882,4.829721362229102
8005623,5,B00011ZBQ6,"Wow, where do I begin?  New opening and closing, great songs and the fight for the Maten scripture.  Houmra the hertic begins his journey to bring down heaven and in his way are the Sanzo-ikko.  Here we see the reincarnations of Sanzo, Hakkai and Gojyo and met a slighty differant Goku.  A must have.",1073088000,,300,4.5
