2904970,1,B000TK1W6C,"When one looks at this DVD case, it looks as if it was stolen in Asia and smuggled into the USA.  I wonder....?  Hesitant to even put it into my player.",1349136000,,152,3.870967741935484
2904971,5,B000TK1W6C,This is one of the Great Miniseries that  Television used to do all so well. Jaclyn Smith is outstanding  as a woman selected to  be the Ambassador to Romania.  Robert Wagner is the man selected to  keep her out of trouble and alive.  Little do they know that a giant conspiracy is  attempting to use her to further their own ends.  The movie shows why Jaclyn Smith was the Queen of the Miniseries.,1320796800,,398,4.3561643835616435
2904972,4,B000TK1W6C,"the story was very good, as i remember the book. the picture quality was almost poor. it was acceptable, just not great.",1296950400,4,120,4.5
2904973,3,B000TK1W6C,"This film is a very faithful adaptation of Sidney Sheldon's novel about Mary Ashley, a university professor who's appointed as US ambassador to Romania, only to realize someone wants to kill her. The plot follows the book very closely so there'll be no surprises for viewers who've read the book. And there's not much suspense but it did keep my interest and I wasn't bored by it. Still, there's nothing that sets it apart from hundreds of other similar TV movies. A weak 3 star rating, may have been a stronger 3 star rating if I hadn't read the book.",1281225600,,552,4.53
2904974,4,B000TK1W6C,"Widowed political scientist, Professor Mary Ashley is appointed US ambassador to Romania and travels there with her children. She had been offered the posting before her husband was killed in a road accident but turned it down as he couldn't leave his medical patients. Her assistant at the embassy is arrogant, self confident Mike Slade who leads a campaign of resentment against her with the other embassy staff. This state of affairs ends when Mary asserts herself and proves to them that her appointment was no mistake. A group of dissidents from various countries try to block her plans for peace and even go so far as to try to assassinate Mary and her children. It's an old style Cold War thriller, headed by two very attractive actors, Jaclyn Smith and Robert Wagner and was excellent viewing on a cold, winter's night.",1218412800,9,827,4.830985915492958

8209867,5,B000TK1W6C,Great and interesting movie,1429056000,,27,6.0
8209868,3,B000TK1W6C,quality was not as good as my previous purchases.,1411862400,,49,4.555555555555555
8209869,5,B000TK1W6C,just like all the other sidney sheldon movies i have purchased i am enjoying it its an old and dated move but I like it very much and am happy i purchased it,1389225600,,157,3.787878787878788
8209870,1,B000TK1W6C,This movie was very disappointing to me. Ms. Smith did a fair job with the role but the storyline was just too vague and dull to say the least.,1388275200,,143,3.9655172413793105
8209871,1,B000TK1W6C,"I love the story, however, I couldn""t watch the DVD because the picture was so faint I couldn see it clearly.  It was bad.",1378684800,6,122,4.083333333333333
8209872,2,B000TK1W6C,"I like the movie fine otherwise I wouldn't have ordered it.  However, whoever or whatever company converted this from VHS to DVD did a lousy job.  I know the movies is old, but you can't understand the audio -- it's so bad and the quality of the picture is terrible.  I'm sorry I bought it.",1373328000,7,290,4.236363636363636
8209873,5,B000TK1W6C,It was a TV mini series so it's long but well worth watching.  Jaclyn Smith and Robert wagner seem to fit well together as co-stars.,1366156800,2,132,4.28
8209874,1,B000TK1W6C,The movie was  messed up.  Must have been scratched or something.  Lot of distortion and had to keep going forward to  get through the mess.  I never could listen to  at least half of it as it ended in the middle of story and up came the cover picture and it was the beginning again.  Just a mess really.,1361404800,,304,4.0508474576271185
8209875,5,B000TK1W6C,I received the movie in good condition and I enjoyed watching it very much.  Great addition to my ever expanding collection.,1355961600,,124,4.904761904761905
