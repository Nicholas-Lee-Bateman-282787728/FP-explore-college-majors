6247121,4,B00I1O35LI,"Not all the performances in this were up to snuff.  The tough guy was dreadful, like an acting TV dinner.  You could swallow it but I wouldn't call it a meal.  The majority of the leads did a really good job.  Others, (homeless man you know who you are ) did way over the top caricatures of what they think those people are like.  The story itself is really good drama and is worth the watch.  Kyle Schmid does a great job and so does Sonja Kinski.  I wish the ending had been more definite but I think feeling unsatisfied is a part of the message of this film.  This could all just be me and my inability to believe that any woman can make a man do crazy, dangerous over the top stuff when I cannot get my man to put in a new bag in the can when I get him to take out the garbage.  It's probably the blood, maybe if I bleed all over the box of hefty bags it would be more enticing.....I should try that and get back to you.",1400716800,3,924,3.924731182795699

8638257,4,B00I1O35LI,"Insane and thoroughly seductive. All the dark things in people's hearts get drawn out in this movie. Love and lust turned to obsession, which sparks off darker things.

8638260,5,B00I1O35LI,"In many ways, this dark movie appropriately named ""Dark Hearts"" seemed to me to be a throwback to the ""film noir"" movies of the 1940s. First take Kyle Schmid (Blood Ties, Being Human, Joy Ride 2) as an aspiring artist who discovers that human blood gives him the necessary red color he needs in order to elevate his paintings to new heights while channeling Kirk Douglas in ""Lust for Life"" as he gradually descends into madness. Then add Sonja Kinski as a latter day Barbara Stanwyck who becomes his muse and lover but is a femme fatale and walking time bomb. And, finally, create a triangle between Schmid, Kinski, and Lucas Till (X-Men, Bravetown, Monster Trucks) - Schmid's attractive brother - and you have a very deadly explosive mix. How this all plays out I leave to the viewer (NO SPOILERS HERE). The acting is excellent, the paintings are eye popping, and the actors are all eerily fetching.. Juliet Landau, Martin Landau's daughter, is the owner of an art gallery and despite limited screen time plays a crucial role in advancing Schmid's artistry. Even she comes off as kind of deliciously creepy at times. However, be warned. This movie is not for everyone, particularly those with a squeamish stomach. The jacket cover even clearly states: ""There is a fine line between passion and obsession."" There is also a fine line between love and hate as well as jealousy and acceptance.",1465689600,3,1390,4.795833333333333

8638262,3,B00I1O35LI,"4 STARS IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TWISTED AND COUNTER CULTURE.
2 1/2 stars for production values rather than subject matter, that's if you catch me on a less generous day.

During an early scene with a band playing and a chick with a spiky bra and a metal grinder making sparks (on the bra), it becomes very clear this is not an ordinary movie. Lets just say this up front, this movie is not for everyone. However, it will develop a following so hear my take on it and decide if it's for you.

THE PLOT: Colson is an artist who is floundering a bit and is accompanied by his brother Sam. While visiting an artsy dive bar, they meet Fran (Sonja Kinski- yes, from the family Kinski you are thinking). Fran is a troubled and mysteriously wild gal who also happens to be controlled by a local mob figure Armand played by Goran Visnjic. Colson falls for Fran and soon finds her as a muse to his artistic talent. This brings him into conflict with Armand. Colson laments to Fran that he doesn't have an old style of red hue paint that is made from animal blood. After he and his brother get a beat down from Armand and his crew, Colson gets a big idea and uses his own blood. Unfortunately that is not enough blood to serve his needs. As Colson's painting style grows darker, made more mysterious by his new muse, he gains the attention of the art world and is suddenly in great demand. Colson's work grows darker and darker as he seems to loose touch with reality. He appears to develop somewhat of a god complex. Whether it's self defense or other, you know people are going to die. There is a real question in this movie as to who is corrupting whom. Is it Fran's influence? Is it his own madness and obsession with his art? Is it the art itself dragging him in?

There have been many a macabre tales of artists mixing blood into their paint to somehow gain an almost supernatural element to their work. So in that sense, I would say this movie is not that original. It is however, something very off beat. It's B movie quality so the acting is a little dodgy and the production values are not top tier. For those interested in this type of thing, that's probably not a deal breaker. Sonja Kisnki flashes those eyes that made us love Natasha so much. Maybe it's the makeup, or maybe the added influence of her Middle Eastern paternal side, but I would say her eyes might just be more enchanting than her mother's. However, when it comes to acting I felt she struggled with the more dramatic moments. Most of the time it wasn't that bad. Sonja made a bewitching figure in the movie for sure, but I don't know if she brought enough heat to believe that almost every character in the movie desired her (including women).

I thought some of the music they threw into the movie was pretty cool and the art that Colson created was believable as well. Obviously it was intended to be disturbing. However, some of the early pieces were quite interesting. Whether they would make it in the real art world, I don't know, but they were actually good enough to believe in the movie. I noticed in the credits for music that there were contributions from Paul Oakenfold and Fairuza Balk, yeah, Fairuza Balk!

If you are just looking for something in the murder mystery or thriller genre, this movie may not be for you. If you like ""off kilter"", counter culture kind of movies and don't mind B movie production values, then maybe this is worth a rental. It wasn't my cup of tea, but I wanted to be fair to those it will appeal to and let the reader choose for themselves.",1403308800,5,3560,4.387878787878788
8638263,5,B00I1O35LI,"I purchased this DVD basically because I am a huge Kyle Schmid fan, but I was wondering what kind of movie it would actually be. I have to say that I was very impressed with the entire cast and the story is probably one of the most original things I've ever seen. It was a pleasure to watch and Schmid especially really shines in this role. I highly recommend it!",1402444800,4,363,4.2
8638264,3,B00I1O35LI,poor acting and convoluted plot.  Kind of seems like one of those lesson learned movies that just does not work.,1401926400,,112,4.6
8638265,5,B00I1O35LI,"I loved the plot and the casting was brilliant. I had never watched Kyle Schmid in much before so his performance really blew me away. He was absolutely amazing and his performance alone is enough reason to watch this movie. He acts amazingly against Sonja Kinski whose performance is very dark and vulnerable. She reminded me of a young Angelina Jolie in Girl, Interrupted. As another reviewer said, this is an intense film, and it had me crying by the end. I liked the ambiguous ending and the plot twist was not expected. I really hope this movie does well.",1401408000,3,560,4.61
