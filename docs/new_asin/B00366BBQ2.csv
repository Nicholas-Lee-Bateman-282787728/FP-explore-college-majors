8389533,5,B00366BBQ2,I seen this on TV and thought it was funny. But also it  brings attention to how much we have to do everyday and how we and others can be affected by that.,1407715200,,155,3.696969696969697
8389534,5,B00366BBQ2,"You'll love this if you're a Molly Shannon fan.  The plot is average, production values are okay, the kids are cute and the humor is sometimes funny.  There's lots of Molly, though, which saves this rather average made-for-TV movie and makes it sparkle.",1274659200,2,253,4.8604651162790695
