1360839,4,B00004W46G,"This one differs a bit from the traditional Christmas Specials that most of us remembered growing up.
The story is told with a 'new age' twist and is filled with fantasy. It's a mystical tale which brilliantly and simply explains the origins of the immortality of Santa Claus and many of his associated traditions of Christmas. Although it's a bit off the beaten path of holiday classics, The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus captures the essence of some universal themes such as the struggles between good & evil and the nature of humanity. It also includes the typical universal holiday themes of peace, joy and goodwill.

This is another holiday favorite that both kids and adults will enjoy.",1070668800,3,697,4.857142857142857
1360840,5,B00004W46G,"I think I'll watch it every year.  This is a great story of how Santa Claus came to be from when he was a baby to a young man who helped children and of course to his old self that we know him today.  It is told like a fairy tale fantasy with elves and sprites; but it is more than just any fantasy, it is a story of a life, the life of Nicholus and is very touching.  Children will love it. So will adults.  I am giving it to my mother, she loves Santa Claus(decorations)and now I see why.  PLEASE release this on DVD!!! Their is no reason NOT to!",976060800,21,548,3.857142857142857
1360841,5,B00004W46G,This video is perfect way to explain Santa to your young ones. It explain the origins of Santa a lot better than any other movie or video out today. It doesn't show it in a materialistic way. The giving of toys was done in a heart-felt way. It brings back the mysticism of Santa that so very much of us have lost as we grew older. It once again allows us to see Santa with the eyes of a child. Innocently. All the answers to why Santa is 'Santa' is here. Its like the Ultimate Guide to Santa Claus.,975888000,11,498,4.040404040404041
1360852,5,B00004W46G,My 3 year old loves this movie.. as an adult and coming from the version if Santa I grew up loving this story is a little far fetched even for make believe's sake. However still a good way to introduce children to who Santa is,1512172800,,226,4.044444444444444

I've been thinking about this movie since I was 6, and I finally found it! I actually didn't open it until Christmas Eve because I was really worried that I wouldn't like it as much as I remembered.

SPOILER ALERT: It's just as good as it was in 2000.

My mom and I had a great time watching it together and it was perfect for Christmas Eve. I love this movie just as much as I did the first time (and the countless times afterwards).",1483660800,,571,4.181818181818182

1360888,5,B00004W46G,"A beautifully animated story that feels more authentic to me than any others I've seen. It explains alot about the ""Woodland Santa / Father Christmas"" types I have seen (mainly in Victorian / vintage cards) going through the woods in the snow with a long winter robe and a sack full of gifts and little trees to bring to families and children. I have always had an interest in the origins of Santa and this one brings many pieces of the puzzle together for me. I love it with all my heart; it is very dear to me.

Note for young children and sensetive individuals: there are a couple of mildly discordant parts in it - some about the life and treatment of children long long ago and the forces that try to keep Santa from reaching the kids....not a deal breaker but a caution for those who are interested in being forewarned about viewing material..",1453248000,2,849,4.4423076923076925

1360936,4,B00004W46G,This is a pretty good adaptation of the book. Of course this is an older movie it's recently been put on DVD so keep that in mind when watching it you're not gonna see any computer animation or anything else like that and the acting is a bit over-the-top but again it didn't do too bad considering the book was written over 100 years ago. If you ever get a chance to read the book it's probably one of the best Christmas stories Ever written. It's written by Frank L Baum ( the same person who wrote the Wizard of Oz),1419120000,,517,4.128712871287129

1360938,5,B00004W46G,I saw this on tv a couple of years ago. And it's by far one of the best  shows ever. ( nothing beats the story of our saviors birth) But this movie shows the humanity of a single man and the true meaning of Christmas. Doing unto others as you would have them done unto you. This is a powerful movie and i just ordered it on here and I can't wait to get it. Thanks Amazon for having things here that you can't find in stores.

I still use many of the explanations of Santa and the giving of gifts that came from this movie.  My oldest loved the scary (not too scary) Ag-gu-wa's (phonetic - no idea on the spelling, sorry) and the fairies and how the immortals made Nicholas one of them because he was so good!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for lovers of Fantasy!",1403827200,,469,4.482352941176471
1360962,5,B00004W46G,I love this story of Santa Claus.  It's more like the origins from the European story than the American story. Love this version!,1400976000,,129,4.608695652173913
1360963,4,B00004W46G,"This was a fun, different explination for the origin of Santa Claus. Given how many interpretations of the tale state Santa Claus has some magic powers, it makes sense for him to be raised in a magical community. Also I was impressed at the amount of life lessons subtly thrown into the movie, though many children will miss them (I did). There some good dark moments, some humor and song nice music even though this is not a musical.

As for flaws, I was slightly dissapointed we didn't get much knowledge about the culture of the magical creatures but they aren't the main focus. Two this was obviously made for a lower age bracket then where I am, so there's some cheezy moments I just faceplant at and finally, how does Blinky end up living as long as Santa Claus? Still very enjoyable and recommended.",1396396800,,806,4.558620689655172
1360964,5,B00004W46G,I have always enjoyed the fantasy fictions in books or movie. I had read this book to my grandchildren and bought it for the families of each one of my children.  I am 80 years old and don't have to justify why I watch what I do watch. The story is such a sweet concept all through and the art work is delightful.  Mrs. Moore,1394755200,,325,3.9846153846153847

1360967,5,B00004W46G,I loved this movie from the first time I saw it on Cartoon Network. I'm glad it became available on DVD. I like that people who may not be religious or not of a Christian background can still enjoy the most major holiday of the year because this story has set Santa in a fantasy land raised by mythical woodland creatures. This story makes Santa a giver to everyone. It's a great option and a good story. It's done by the same person who did The Wizard of OZ. What's not to love?,1392076800,,479,4.161290322580645

How can one easily describe the moment when you find that hidden gem that has been forgotten after all these years... Oh yeah, this is that GEM! It would be to long of a story to tell you how many years I spent looking for this movie through talks with friends and family. Asking them, ""have you ever watched the movie where Santa Claus was raised by faires and then lived in a log cabin in the woods with his friend that looked like a monkey. In was on Cartoon Network one year?"" Then the answer would be the same, ""What?""
Well folks long story short, this is Zen. The movie in itself is not award winning nor the best written, but it has a lot of charm and spirit. The movie I once saw in the early 2000's was a great fantasy of Old ST Nick that was very gripping and fun to watch, but with age the once lovable story seems to ring hollow on a man that is criticizing its writing.... Then it happened a second watch with my 4 year old niece who's emotions and reactions to Santa Claus were fulfilling in themselves.
This second play through with her actually makes me think of the first time I watched it and how I should look at kids movies/shows through the eyes of a child instead of the narcissistic and cynical old man I will become. Overall the self gratification of finding the movie that everybody thought I made up and the hopes that I can cherish this movie with my nieces and nephews, and someday my own kids, is worth owning.",1359331200,2,1520,4.22680412371134

Well, to make a long story short, I lost my wife a few years ago, but I never gave up hope for obtaining this movie.  At long last, by searching Amazon by the actors I knew had voiced the characters, I finally came across it by referencing Hal Holbrook, who basically narrates the story.

1361088,5,B00004W46G,"My brother and I are sssooooo happy this movie finally came out on DVD! We've been looking for a copy of this movie since we first saw it on Cartoon Network--- which was a VERY long time ago. So we've been searching for years with no luck. I saw the VHS on Amazon, but it is way too much money for an outdated viewing format... plus my brother and I want to keep this treasure for a LONG time. That's how important this film was to us.

Every so often I would check around to see if it was finally available, and this time around it was! I texted my brother, who is away at college, ""Guess what I found?"" His immediate response was, ""Life and Adventures of Santa Claus?!?!?"" I was floored that he guessed on the first try. He told me that if I had said no he would be really sad. He is 21 years old! I'm 22.

This movie became our own special tradition (usually our parents are involved, but not this time), and we would always sit and watch it on Christmas Eve after dinner but before Midnight mass when it played on CN. When they changed their Christmas lineup, we were sad and disappointed. We searched the channels and looked in stores but couldn't find it. We regretted not taping it off the TV.

I guess the point to my story is, you won't be sorry getting this movie. It is about good will, kindness, and generosity. It will bring your family together and seem magical to your kids (even if they're preteens, which is when my brother and I discovered it). While looking for this film, we found the Rankin/Bass version, and HATED it. This is so much more beautiful, the animation is wonderful and the story doesn't come across as clunky as the R/B version. I feel for these characters and their issues... but the R/B version makes me care less. The biggest difference is the great Ack or Ark (I can't remember, it's been so long); R/B's is very cruel, while this version he is very sympathetic.

I have watched just about every animated/stop motion Christmas special ever, but this one takes a special place in my heart.  It is rare and not widely known but it should be.  It is wonderful!  It has a charm that the Rankin Bass version does not.  I love Rankin Bass xmas specials especially Rudolph and the Year Without a Santa Claus, but there is room on the animation xmas landscape for gems like this one.  It is rather long but enchanting.  I think it will appeal to adults and older kids. I don't particularly care for the songs or the Awgawas goofiness but those are minor flaws.  This is a very well done special that more people should take time to notice.  I just love this incarnation of the Santa Claus legend.  Very unique!",1322352000,3,991,4.568181818181818

They took the original book and the concept from Rankin-Bass' puppet adaption and just used tradition animation to remake the exact same film. I don't like how they remade alot of the characters and the original will always by far be the best because Rankin/Bass were and are cutting edge in my mind.,1196553600,2,471,4.488372093023256

This felt cheesy and half-hearted whereas the stop motion animated one has the distinct feel of a classic and was more true to the heart and feel of the old story by L. Frank Baum.

The story is good but it feels dumbed down compared to the stop motion version. A seldom known fact, Baum connected this story to his loved The Wizard of Oz by saying the immortal faeries of this story are the ones who enchanted the land of Oz to begin with.",1186704000,2,647,4.260162601626016

Many questions young children ask about Santa such as his age, etc., are magically answered in this must watch tale.  I put this movie on for the kids when family came to visit and found even the grandparents sitting down and intrigued by the story.  The music is perfect for the storytelling, and the lessons learned in this movie help my children appreciate their life a little more.

The music was gorgeous, the characters endearing, and it was obvious that great pains were taken to bring it to detailed life.  Such is not that case here.

I saw this once through and can't stand to see it ever again.  The supporting character, Whisk (Tingler from the R/B version is waaaay better) is as annoying as JarJar Binks was to SW Episode I.  They made the Awgwas absolutely stupid and completely non-threatening in their appearance AND portrayal...AND the good-guys couldn't even pronounce Awgwa right...and let's not forget that in this version Nikolaus is somehow OBLIVIOUS to the fact that his best friends are going to war for him.  The characters feel very wooden to me, and the animation of them is sub-par here as well.  In addition, the music score is very forgettable...and as a musician that is a very hard thing for me to say.

Overall this is an extremely dissapointing retelling of a story that was already done to near-perfection.  Stick with the book and the Rankin/Bass version, and avoid this like the plauge.",1134691200,5,1223,4.758293838862559

I'm a sap. So I can't believe I missed this one--it's the story of how Santa Claus came to be told in the most mystical and magical way possible. I wasn't familiar with Baum's original book, so the fable of Nicholas as a baby being found and raised by faerie-folk, the love of his adopted mother (an immortal), how he grew as a boy into a young man and, finally, the ho ho ho jolly older man we all know, how he began to give gifts and how he discovered his love of gift-giving to children...all are covered in such a unique way. Even the reindeer/sleigh/chimney/stockings/Xmas tree--it's all here! Very Irish tale, as well, it's not hard to see the nearby village and the inhabitants are supposed to be in Ireland. There's good old-fashioned good vs. evil, great songs, excellent animation, beautiful and magical beings right out of Lord Of The Rings. Is it wrong that I thought Santa as a handsome young man was totally hot? If you're a Christmas junkie and also into fantasy tales, this one may be the best holiday movie (animated) you've ever seen.

It shows a wonderful concept that Santa was human and helped to make lives better by bringing hope back to children and adults.
The fact that he is raised by and befriended by faries, pixies, gnomes and other fantasy creatures adds to the charm and wonder of the story.

7924692,5,B00004W46G,"We had this movie on VHS tape. It was one of the few I wanted to replace and keep. It is such an unusual explanation of the origin of Santa Claus, based off a book by L. Frank Baum (Author of the Wizard of Oz) and my kids really liked it back when. The book is an excellent Christmas read, almost an adventure story. It clearly puts Santa Claus into a different realm of fantasy, but retains the values of kindness and generosity. This story is completely divorced from the tenuous religious connection of Santa Claus to St. Nicholas yet has an explanation for all his supernatural powers. It's actually a relief to have an alternate secular explanation for Santa Claus that is such a good story. It is a very hard movie to find. The animation was much worse than I remembered, but all our exposure to CGI and advanced animation techniques makes us judge older stuff more harshly. The story line seemed not as coherent after I had read the book, but it's way, way better than a lot of other more well known Christmas favorites. Everyone was happy to see this come into the house as the tape had seen better days , yet  the story was still one of our favorites. I was worried about the quality as it was an ""add on"" dvd item, but it played perfectly. Someday we will have to try the claymation version.",1514592000,,1301,4.37603305785124
