4140363,3,B003L77GPG,"I was a fan of Season One even though it took quite a few episodes to find it's groove with me.  Season Two was just plain bad.  The finale of season one gave you the impression that Tanya was going to start getting tough and that never happened this season.  It was basically her getting worse and more neurotic (if that's possible!), Ray in ridiculous or just plain boring situations.  (Yes, I understand the concept of a coach turned gigolo is just as ridiculous but some things were just irritating.)  Focused way too much on things that viewers are looking to escape from and there was no pay off in the finale.  It gave me no reason to want to tune in to season three.  I probably will for a few episodes just to see if the writers get their heads out of their rump and go back to writing something decent but this is just turning into as big a disappointment as this season of Weeds.",1288224000,13,890,4.293413173652695
4140364,5,B003L77GPG,"After completeing season two of ""Hung"" in the late summer of 2010, HBO has already announced the second year will soon be finding its way onto DVD and Blue Ray shelves. If that isn't enough good news, the cable station has stated that season three of ""Hung"" has been ordered and will air, as usual, during the summer in 2011.

 ""Hung"" deals with the adventures of a good-looking basketball coach named Ray (played to perfection by mega-stud Thomas Jane) living in a suburb of Detroit. In order to make ends meet he enters the escort business as he possess a rather large bodily ""tool"" that lots of women find most attractive. The series deals with his interactions with his former wife, played beautifully by Anne Heche, as well as his two children. The second season mainly deals with Ray's involvement with his two female pimps, Lenore and Tanya, who both have different ideas in making Ray a huge success.

 This season, like season two, has 10 entertaining and well-written thirty minute episodes. Here is a list of those shows along with their original airdates.

1. ""Just The Tip"", June 27, 2010
2. ""Tucson Is The Gateway To Dick, or This Is Not Sexy"", July 11, 2010
3. ""Mind Bullets or Bang Bang Bang..."" , July 18, 2010
4. ""Sing It Again, Ray or Home Plate"", July 25, 2010
5. ""A Man, a Plan, or Thank You, Jimmy Carter"", August 1, 2010
6. ""Beaverland"", August 8, 2010
7. ""The Middle East Is Complicated"", August 15, 2010
8. ""Third Base or The Rash"", August 22, 2010
9. ""Fat Off My Love or I Am The Alllergen, August 29, 2010
10. ""Even Steven or The Luckiest Kid In Detroit"", September, 12, 2010",1284681600,23,1602,4.529411764705882

4145658,2,B003L77GPG,"I can see why the show was cancelled. If you have one character that brings the show down, you cut them out, but this is a show that probably found it hard to get rid of said characters. For me it was Tanya.  I thought maybe after one season she'd get better. Once Charlie came along, I thought, maybe she'd learn a thing or two.  Nope. She was the same person from season one, an awkward sociopath, that kept f!@#ing it all up for Ray.  The writing depended on her screwing a thing or two, and stringing it along for a couple episodes while they played patch-up.  If they cut her out and made the show episodic, each episode a new John (or is it Jane with gigilos?), and Ray growing somehow out of it, like they had done from time to time, it would have been great. Lenore was great. She knew her place and Ray's and evolved as she saw fit.  Tanya on the other hand, stayed in her cocoon and just banged her head against it every episode, not realizing she was rocking the boat the whole time.  Started watching it because I was working on a project at home and needed something to play in the background. Tells you how annoying and destructive to the show she was when I just to take time off from my DIY project to write this and work on finding something else to watch.",1445904000,3,1273,4.19672131147541

Once in a while it drags but not often. Every performer has their part down. It's hard to believe that the woman who are ""on top"" are not the actual clients getting the most for their hard (on) earned dollar.

See it with a bowl of popped corn or a vibrator or both.

4147095,4,B003L77GPG,"Not quite as good as season 1, but still amusing.  The entire premise of the show (that a large wanker is all women want) is faulty.  Size doesn't really matter.  Your biggest sex organ is between your ears.  But, that being said, I think this series is funny and depicts real everyday problems that ordinary people can relate to.  I'm not sure where they are going with the odd twins, maybe nowhere, but I've sort of been expecting that some issues there will be resolved.  Good character development although I didn't like how Tanya starts consulting with a proper pimp.  That was unrealistic and I expected Tanya to grow a backbone more than she did.  However, the Anne Heche character is growing one.  I'll definitely watch season three.  I'd never heard of Thomas Jane before watching this but I think he did a great job.

4147178,4,B003L77GPG,"This show is a nice diversion from reality. I love the setting (Detroit), and the way it's filmed makes great use of the scenery.
It has a totally unbelievable premise, mainly because sex for money seems like it would be a luxury item that, women especially, would not be shelling out for during a recession. But I'm willing to suspend disbelief. The writing style seems to be the 'throw-it-against-the-wall-and see-what-sticks' one. There is a lot of waffling around by the characters, which I think was a popular TV trope back in the first decade of the 2000s. This was filmed in 2009, and it's funny to see how dated it looks, especially the teenagers and their goth styles. It's not the fault of the show, but it reminded me how time flies. Worth checking out. It's not going to change your world, but it's a fun escape. It does strike me as a bit unfair that there's female frontal nudity (and other types of female nudity) but no male.

4148352,5,B003L77GPG,"""Hung: Season 2"" takes the comedy-drama genre series deeper into the psyche of all regular and recurring characters. With part-time male prostitute Ray Drecker (Thomas Jane) and female pimp Tanya Skagle (Jane Adams) continuing as the key protagonists, Season 2 examines the complexity of Ray working for rival pimp Lenore Bernard (Rebecca Creskoff), and his efforts to try to return stability to his life. Despite the pimp power struggle Ray makes further progress with increased bookings, which also contributes to a renewed desire to please clients. Bit by bit he finds himself in a better situation as his finances improve, and his relationship with his children grows as they appreciate his wholehearted parenting more. Season 2 also notably provides more insights to a range of people who contribute to Ray's life, which includes: his ex-wife Jessica Haxon (Anne Heche), next door neighbours, high school work colleagues etc., and their further development as characters complements the storyline of Ray making forward steps in a number of areas of his life.

The supporting actors are perfectly cast, especially Jane Adams as Ray Drecker's (Jane) quirky female pimp. I've yet to order the third, and final, season. I'm sure they don't show just how much Thomas Jane is packing, but one can dream! Bon appetit!

Whatever it was that captivated me and my sweetheart about season one, was TOTALLY lacking in season two. I think season number one took a very unlikely premise that was replete with varous comic opportunities and made good use of them. Season two continued the established story but took it nowhere worth going.

Probably one year passed from the time I had watched season one and the time I watched season two. Watching season two and being BORED right from the beginning made me realize how SHORT each season is, namely only 10 thiry minute episodes.  I did not pay a lot for this series, but even so, the story line no longer delivered even modest entertainment.  the 300 or so minutes was better than a BAD movie, but it did not live up what I have come to expect from the best of HBO when HBO is really delivering the ""goods.""",1325894400,3,946,4.4508670520231215

4148487,2,B003L77GPG,"I've watched seasons I and II of Hung with mixed emotions. In season II I'm heading more toward dropping it, due largely to the writing and in some increasing sense, the casting.

The premise, that Ray Drecker is a high school coach (getting laid off in this season) by day, and reluctant male prostitute by night, totally sparks my interest. Current, provocative, a story seed that can grow and blossom in any number of interesting ways.  However the writers just aren't going anywhere at all with this. The shock value of an average Joe using his biggest endowment to earn a salary wore off in Season I.  We saw Ray awkwardly executing his first few jobs, we saw him come to terms, sorta, with his status as male prostitute, we saw Tanya the poet totally get off on the vision of herself as a pimp.  Enter the evil conniving woman who tries to take over the business for a bit of intrigue and stress.  And that... is pretty much where we have Season II as well.  And the first few episodes of Season III.  Nothing much is happening that's new, and they've explored most of the avenues opened in the first several episodes of the entire series. There simply isn't any freshness in the story line.

Another problem I have is the relative sexiness of the show. I'm a woman - the target client of this fictional male gigolo - and what I'm seeing is more of a male-fantasy version of a man giving women what they want so much they're willing to pay $600 a pop for it. For instance one recurring theme is that Ray drops his pants to show a woman his size, and they immediately become obsessed with having him. [A thousand online dating clients with cell phone cameras will tell you that this approach does not seem to actually entice your average woman] I'm not really getting the sex appeal.  Yes, he's handsome, but that only goes so far.

As a viewer, I want to root for Ray and I want to see him develop the fantasy that he's selling in order to like and stick with his character. It would be forgivable if early on he was uncertain what made women tick and gradually came to understand that it wasn't a big you-know-what. However what I'm seeing is a character who doesn't seem to especially like women in any way that could come across as passion, sexiness or even interest to work out how to really please them. He sighs quite a bit (actually quite disgusting, old-man phlegm-filled rattles), he frowns, he isn't gentle, he argues with them defensively when they tell him what they want, he rarely appears interested in any part of the process, and even in the heat of the sex scenes themselves he's often shown looking exhausted and as if he's one step away from either a stroke or a back injury. In fact he DOES often get injured by his usually younger, more limber and more exuberant clients.  As a viewer not opposed to some hot sex scenes, can I just say there's nothing sexy about a man who can't caress a woman without dislocating a shoulder and then rolling around on the floor clutching himself and groaning dramatically while the woman asks if he's okay and apologizes for hurting him? As a woman, I'm not feeling that.

Following on that thought... this season the actor himself (who is actually very handsome) has aged visibly. Yet they still team him up with much younger women, and I'm finding it harder and harder to suspend my disbelief that these girls who are in some cases young enough to be his daughter, are interested in this frowning, sighing, curmudgeonly man.  And it's becoming harder to watch his character basically pummel these very young women into a wall as hard as possible as if that's all a woman could possibly desire (and as a woman who has participated in many conversations pondering how to disabuse a partner of that particular belief, I keep waiting for the story line to address this) - the age disparity is starting to feel more 'umm...gross' than 'ooh..edgy'.

I've watched the first few episodes of Season III to see if the competing-gigolo story line did anything for the show's major issues, but so far it's actually almost highlighting the largest problems I have with it.",1318896000,59,4122,4.567750677506775

Yes, you'll have to tuck away your moral compass for a bit for this bit of devilish deportment, but it might be worth it-- fictional and all that. Heads up, there is nudity and sexual acting out--  hence the MA rating. The cast is top-rate across the board and their performances really solid. The 2 actors playing Ray's adolescent kids, Charlie Saxton and Sianoa Smit-McPhee, are quirkily winning and do an impressive job, as does Anne Heche as the ex-wife. There's not a single miss in the casting. The writing is exceptional, particularly in its ability to so humanize and make accessible the two protagonists. Directing is also excellent. Watching a totally visible Tanya in her ungainly attempts at scurrying out of sight to avoid detection or confrontation is a comic coup. While this series, based solely on subject matter, might not generally be a part of my compendium of films, once I took a peek, I had to see it all.  Series 1 is very good, Series 2 even better, which isn't always the case.  Pace and hilarity don't miss a beat.",1498348800,3,1346,4.719148936170213
