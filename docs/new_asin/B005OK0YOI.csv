8481392,1,B005OK0YOI,One of those 1940s Westerns that was amazing - then - but cannot sustain the test of time.,1462406400,,90,4.055555555555555

8481394,1,B005OK0YOI,"This is one of the worst westerns ever.  I love these 1950 westerns, but this one has a weak plot and no action.  The riding is kept to a minimum, probably because the actors can't ride.  I think the horses were sent straight to the glue factory upon completion of the so-called ""film"".  The end is dumb.  Really dumb.  Weak.  An insult.  Only 67 minutes long.  It is almost as if the movie makers were out to insult not just me, but the American public too.  The only way this was ever put out to the public was with one or two other films at the same time.  Luckily I saw this free on Netflix (mostly on fast forward).  The only good thing about this movie was that the real James Brown, the hardest working man in rock and roll, wasn't in it.  Pathetic.",1418601600,,756,4.166666666666667
8481395,4,B005OK0YOI,"I am a bit surprised that I am the first apparently, to review this MGM on Demand DVD. It's Robert Kent/E.Cahn UA film from 1961, so you roughly should know what to expect. It's almost like a predecessor to the A.C.Lyles films in that nearly everyone seems to be over 40. Stolid (likeable) James Brown dominates, with good support from a still sexy Jean Willes and Peggy Stewart, not forgetting Jack Pickard and Med Flory. There is a lot of talk, mostly studio work with some location riding and shooting. 1 hefty fist fight, and a fairly unusual treatment of what could have been a corny plot. An excellent print with a must see trailer. It seems to be only $13 plus postage which makes it a better bargain. I enjoyed it, but, honestly, I can only recomend it to hardcore fans, as it isn't the best of this team and period.",1356912000,2,824,4.427631578947368
