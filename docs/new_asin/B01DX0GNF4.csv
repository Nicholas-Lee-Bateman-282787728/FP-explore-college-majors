7725981,3,B01DX0GNF4,I love this show but once again Amazon is using discs that do not work on all DVD players.  I can watch this one on my computer but I would prefer watching through my DVD player.  Amazon...please go back to using the DVDs you used to use years ago.,1488240000,3,248,4.040816326530612
7725982,1,B01DX0GNF4,"I love the show and am attempting to collect all in the series.  I tried them in 5 different DVD players and some you get audio, but no video, some you can't get past the menu, and 1 I got both but the color was only bright green and purple.  Do not buy,  I had to send back my replacement because of the same issue.  S 22 and S23 are out for pre order but don't buy them either until you are sure Amazon has the problem with the supplier resolved.  These are the poorest quality discs, they even look different.",1487548800,3,512,4.02970297029703
7725983,1,B01DX0GNF4,Do not buy.  Same problems as season 21 will not play on DVD player.  Will play on computer but not DVD player.,1487548800,2,111,4.0
7725984,2,B01DX0GNF4,"Love the show, but it's the same garbage with the DVD that I and many experienced with season 21.  The audio is fine, but there's no video playback.  I tried to cancel this order after the trouble I had with season 21, but wasn't allowed to do so since it was part of a 'deal'.  So now Amazon is going to have to pay for the return in addition to the original shipment.  I really want to buy and support the release of The Amazing Race, but won't do so until I hear that the issues with these discs have been resolved.",1487376000,5,518,4.049019607843137

8757171,1,B01DX0GNF4,"Terrible quality DVD.  The picture is a bright green mess.  Thought Amazon would have straightened out this problem, but clearly they haven't.  Same problem with Season 21.  Both are being sent back for refund.",1513296000,,210,5.088235294117647

8757173,3,B01DX0GNF4,"This is the third time that I've ordered ""The Amazing Race"" from Amazon and I have had a problem with the audio being out of sync with the video. Since these are made on demand, I must assume that they are being rushed into production at the expense of quality control. The show itself is fine. The DVD sucks.",1509840000,,309,4.254237288135593
