2816279,2,B000PDZIVS,"Knowing that she wrote the introduction to Myron Mixon's excellent ""Smokin'"" cookbook, we were excited to watch this dvd and pick up some Southern barbecue tips.  I've seen Paula Deen's show on Food network before, and I don't love or hate her (she's fine, I like some of her recipes).  The DVD starts with Paula going to a friend's house to check out his pit..  awesome, the pit looked great and they were making a few racks or ribs and some butts.  She spends about 5 minutes at the pit, and then says ""we can make something even better inside!"".  Wait what?  This is supposed to be about barbecue, you can't make that inside.  The next recipe on the menu was a soup and then we gave up.  It's good if you like Paula Deen, but this ain't barbecue!",1360281600,,749,4.338129496402877

8190645,5,B000PDZIVS,If you love Paula you will love this set.  I began collecting her dvds after the Food Network dropped her.  She is such a joy to watch.  Shame on the food network for firing a national treasure!  We love you Paula!,1423872000,,214,4.146341463414634
8190646,5,B000PDZIVS,Bought this for my daughter who's a big Paula Deen fan.  She loves it.,1406678400,,70,4.0
8190647,5,B000PDZIVS,This is a set of the older Paula shows and reminds me of how much I miss seeing her cheerful personality every Saturday morning.  Food Network has no show on that compares to how good Paula's shows were and how sincere and down to earth she was on her shows.  You don't see other people on their shows coming across so sincere and honest - most sound like a scripted discussion.  Paula made me laugh and reminisce so much and I truly miss seeing her every week.  Shame on Food Network!!!  This is a great set for the price!,1395619200,2,523,4.242424242424242
8190648,5,B000PDZIVS,I enjoyed this DVD.  I love Paula Deen's cooking.  The recipes were something anyone could make.  And yet very attractive.  I'm sure it would impress and family or guest.,1392163200,,170,4.758620689655173
8190649,5,B000PDZIVS,Cooking is fun with Paula Deen.  She makes you want to cook and have fun doing it.  A wealth of information and help in this DVD.  So happy I purchased this!,1376265600,,157,4.0
