3691786,5,B001LXIDUY,"The original ""Peter Sellers Collection"" was released by Anchor Bay and it contained 6 DVDs, including ""Hoffman."" Reviewers considered ""Hoffman"" to be the odd-man-out in the set, so that may have influenced the re-release. Giving this set 1 star because of this confusion about two Sellers releases with the same title is just peevish. A little research, right here on Amazon, would have settled the matter.

This is a great set, displaying not just Sellers' excellent early work but showcasing postwar British comedy which was often ahead of its time.

This is an easy five-star recommendation.",1373587200,15,594,5.177083333333333
3691787,1,B001LXIDUY,"The FIVE movies on FIVE CDS that are actually in the box set are fine and should receive all their stars-- if you are a Sellers fan.
However,  I am giving one star for the misleading Amazon ""editorial reviews"", which lead you to believe that there are SIX movies in the box set.

Amazon's initial review lists SIX movies. But if you do look at  the ""product description"" below the erroneous review, you will see there are only five. HOFFMAN is the missing movie. So if you want to that movie you have to order another CD.  The box by LIONSGATE does say ""5 films"".  Amazon needs to clarify that this set no longer contains HOFFMAN.",1335139200,6,630,4.396551724137931
3691788,3,B001LXIDUY,"All the DVDs are excellent transfers of the original films, both vision and audio doing justice to the original productions. In particular I was pleased with the copy of ""The Smallest Show on Earth"", because a copy I'd previously purchased from other offerings on Amazon was practically unwatchable. The films themselves are not Seller's best, but they do demonstrate the range of his talents. All were produced between 1957 and 1963 and none match the standard of ""The Mouse That Roared"" or ""Dr Strangelove"" (made in the same period). The Bolting Brother comedies are usually grounded in social comment (e.g. ""I'm All Right Jack"") so these films (not ""Two Way Stretch"") are satires rather than simple comedies; the layers of social comment underlay the not always successful farcical activities. ""Two Way Stretch"" is, I think, the least successful of the vehicles for Seller's talents, the tough guy prisoner giving him little scope. The other four films are quite enjoyable (""The Smallest Show"" is a great favourite of film societies) and the viewer needs to be aware that the best of British humour is quietly commenting on the foibles of society. Amusing rather than hilarious is how I would classify these films, and there is the added interest of seeing the performances of other major talents of the British studios. We enjoyed the films and are pleased to add this collection to our library.",1272412800,24,1399,5.008583690987124

3691790,4,B001LXIDUY,"The sound and picture quality of the film prints and the digital transfers are excellent.  The films, though not major works and often find Mr. Sellers in supporting roles, are quite enjoyable for fans of late 1950's British comedy.  (Terry Thomas is often more fun to watch than Peter Sellers.)",1254182400,6,295,4.88
3691791,4,B001LXIDUY,"Here's what's in the collection.  It's sad that a customer has to put this up instead of the publisher or Amazon.  From Lionsgate...

I'M ALL RIGHT JACK: When naive Oxford graduate Stanley (Ian Carmichael) is hired as a lowly employee in his uncle's missile factory, the factory's socialist shop steward Fred (Sellers) sees a great political opportunity. Soon, Stanley finds himself stuck between Fred's union and the family business, leading to an epic comedic tug-of-war! THE SMALLEST SHOW ON EARTH: When their great-uncle dies, newlyweds Matt and Jean Spencer (Bill Travers, Virginia McKenna) inherit a dilapidated small-town cinema that comes with an eccentric staff including a drunken projectionist (Sellers), a dotty cashier (Margaret Rutherford) and an ancient usher/janitor (Bernard Miles). CARLTON-BROWN OF THE F.O.: When valuable mineral deposits are discovered on the forgotten British colony of Gaillardia, the Foreign Office sends bumbling envoy Cadogen de Vere Carlton-Browne (Terry-Thomas) to investigate. But while negotiating with the corrupt Prime Minister Amphibulos (Sellers), Carlton-Browne is convinced to split the tiny island in half, sparking a revolution that builds to an international nuclear showdown. TWO-WAY STRETCH: Criminal mastermind Dodger Lane (Sellers) is a model inmate at Huntleigh Prison until he and his cellmates hatch a plan to break out of jail, steal a sultan's diamonds from a military convoy and then break back into jail before morning. HEAVENS ABOVE! Sellers stars as Reverend John Smallwood, an idealistic prison chaplain who is accidentally assigned to a wealthy parish known for its popular sedative/laxative. When Smallwood insists on ministering to both rich and poor, he manages to somehow infuriate both groups - along with the entire town government!",1233619200,69,1808,5.639705882352941

3691815,4,B001LXIDUY,"The five British-made films featured in this Lion's Gate re-release of THE PETER SELLERS COLLECTION are nicely dubbed.
There's no ""extras"" with this set.

I'M ALL RIGHT JACK! has some great sight gags and adult humor. It's the story of a young man at loose ends after returning from WWII who's trying to decide on a career path.

HEAVENS ABOVE is a good satire on both religion and commercialism, but it's spoiled by a silly ""minister in space"" finale.

THE SMALLEST SHOW ON EARTH is an early success for Sellers, who plays an elderly projectionist in a rundown movie theater.

CARLETON-BROWNE is a mediocre Terry-Thomas political farce where Sellers is wasted as the corrupt prime minister of an island nation long affiliated wth Britain. Not very funny or entertaining.

TWO WAY STRETCH is a neatly done prison comedy that has Sellers pulling a heist with an ironclad alibi for protection: supposedly he's incarcerated when this crime occurs.

3691818,3,B001LXIDUY,"Yes I like Sellers, a comic genius, overlooked by many critics and fans.  The collection is not the best of his movies I think it more of the ""only ones that are not caught up in copy right, estate squables.  In my opinion this is missing quite a few of his best movies.  Watch out for those from Australia those are chopped and sensored because of TV down under back in those days has strong controls over what they though was against what they thought should appear on TV",1391904000,,473,4.292134831460674

Offered at $8 -$10, I can't imagine there's a better deal currently available in movies; the fine writing and acting in each of the five films make this a highly recommended choice.",1391817600,,359,4.714285714285714
