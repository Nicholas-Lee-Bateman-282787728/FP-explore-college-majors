8368627,4,B002EZT4V0,Every week I purchase one of the Grandes Peleas Volumes because i collect fights and they are a good quality fights and inexpensive. This one has good fights but bitter endings. Hence the name tradgedys in the ring. I had a hard time stomaching the Jimmy Garcia-Gabriel Ruelas fight ending where they showed him fainting and taken in the squad. These men gave their life to the sport. It is a sad reality. Two fights are in english and one fight in spanish(Alberto Davilla vs Francesco Bejines).,1343606400,,495,4.7011494252873565
