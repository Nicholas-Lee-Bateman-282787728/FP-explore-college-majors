4155134,5,B003M986UM,A great gangster film from start to finish. From the opening scene this film will have you hooked. A great score by the legendary Ennio Morricone and great performances by John Cassavetes and Peter Falk. Cassavetes is always classic but I think Peter Falk steals the show in this one. Do yourself a favor and pick this film up if you are a fan of gangster films or films in general.,1287187200,,382,4.394366197183099
4155135,5,B003M986UM,"First, I got this blu ray for Britt Ekland. I have never seen a more beautiful model or actress. Believe me, I've looked. When I see the quality of this transfer on a 60 inch 1080p screen, it's hard to believe that this movie was made in the 1960s. The work met my highest hopes. If you have this movie on VHS, or standard def on your DVR, then expect to be impressed by the image quality. One complaint is that the extras are almost non-existant.
The movie is pretty good if you like that type of thing. I must warn some viewers that Britt Ekland is not treated the way any woman deserves. The sex scene is creepy because of this, but I don't want to give away any more of the movie. This is a must have for any Britt Ekland fan.",1286064000,10,730,4.076388888888889
4155136,5,B003M986UM,"Short'n sweet; Film 5 Stars//BD 4.

What a fantastic find. Blue Underground is fastly becomming my fav studio for Blu-rays. I have been watching films for a long time, but still can find hidden gems like Giuliano Montaldo's: Machine Gun McCain thanks to them.

If you want the film's synopsis, please read Amazon's, cause it hits the mark. Be warned, though, this film comes with a tonne of style, an amazing score (Ennio Morricone!!!) and a BIG punch. Hank McCain is the main character played by John Cassavetes who is just brillient. Nobody F___s with McCain!

The Blu-ray itself is very high quality with great picture and sound (DTS HD mono) for a movie that is 41 years old. Be warned, there is some excess grain in the wide open shots (not so many), but for the most the picture is clear and colourful. Extras are tight with just the 23 min Interview with Director Giuliano Montaldo and 2 trailers.

Highly recommended.

4155137,5,B003M986UM,"Blue Underground has done it again with this visually stunning transfer of Italian Director Giuliano Montaldo's crime epic 'MACHINE GUN MCCAIN'.  I first saw this movie about 15 years ago on Cinemax with a pan and scan OK print which I taped.  I loved the feel and grittiness of the subject matter and was really anticipating this release.  It was worth the wait.  The widescreen negative looks brand spanking new with bright colors showing off the technicolor image and the sound is aurally magnificent. Montaldo shot this film in the US with both Euro and American actors as he did his other great heist movie from 1967 'GRAND SLAM'.  John Cassavetes is excellent as the title character lured into another job after being released from prison.  The cast is awesome: Peter Falk, Gena Rowlands, Britt Ekland at her most beautiful, Euro stars Florinda Bolkan, Luigi Pistilli from 'THE GOOD, THE BAD ,& THE UGLY' ,Gabriele Ferzetti who also worked with Sergio Leone and played Diana Riggs father in the best of the non Connery Bonds 'ON HER MAJESTYS SECRET SERVICE'  'and Tony Kendall from countless Euro Spy movies just to name a few.  The film is like a cross between the Mafia crime dramas and poliziotteschi films which cropped up in the early seventies. Montaldo weaves his story creating a work of mythic porportions around Mccain's character with an ethereal music score by maestro Ennio Morricone.  It also harkens back to the gangster films of director Raoul Walsh such as 'HIGH SIERRA' and 'WHITE HEAT' with the anti hero moving through one crisis after another till his inevitable demise.  It also contains a great interview with the director which makes Blue Underground one of the best companies in preserving these underrated Euro artists for future generations.  Don't think about it, just press the add to cart button on this DVD which along with Olive Films flawless transfer of 'HANNIE CAULDER' emerges as the best and most important film archived from the sixties released this year.  Bravo, Blue Underground.",1282694400,5,2026,4.961538461538462
4155138,5,B003M986UM,"There aren't many of Cassavetes ""jobs for hire"" that mean much to fans of the films he directed. Sure, it's fun to see DePalma do a ZABRISKIE POINT on his head in THE FURY, and he brings a certain refined sense of evil to his role as CIA spook... Occasionally there's a fire to his performance in Mazursky's THE TEMPEST that outshadows the rest of the film and makes you wish he were the director... Franco in THE DIRTY DOZEN is a fun enough creation but not really a Cassavetean character... Generally speaking, whatever of St. Cassavetes' magic might be glimpsed in his commercial film work is fleeting, there by accident or snuck in through the cracks, and not particularly significant to Cassavetes' own body of work. With obvious exceptions - MIKEY AND NICKY - the films he acted in but didn't direct don't deserve substantial treatment alongside his ""real"" films.

It's really, really hard for me to feel that way about MACHINE GUN McCAIN, though.

I'm basing this on a European PAL DVD that came out a couple of years ago; I haven't seen the new R1 version, but assuming it's the same... What you get here is a very straightforward tale of the committed little guy (Hank McCain, a smalltime bankrobber) using guts and integrity and ruthlessness to take on the Mafia. Initially he is sprung from prison by a gangster (Peter Falk) to do a job - rob a casino for him. When the gangster discovers that the casino is actually owned by his bosses, he tries to call off the robbery, but McCain is unstoppable. Along the way, he enlists an innocent young woman's help (Britt Ekland); eventually, he's on the run with her, seeking shelter briefly with his old flame, played by Gena Rowlands. How much influence Cassavetes, Rowlands, and Falk had on Montaldo I can't say, but anyone who has read Ray Carney on GLORIA and THE KILLING OF A CHINESE BOOKIE - and I'm assuming true Cassavetes fans have - will understand that Cassavetes was fascinated by gangsters and often used them to figure the Hollywood system he was so at odds with, the money men and thugs and controllers who stifled creativity and true expression. Unlike either of those films, tho', here we have Cassavetes himself sinking his teeth into the role of an ""independent"" battling ""the system."" Cassavetes crackles in this role like he was born for it, and makes the whole doomed romanticism of the story arc (as the costs of his rebellion get higher and higher) that much more poignant. I'm not saying it's an art film, mind you - it's a hardboiled Italian gangster film with some pretty badly dubbed secondary roles and lots of violence and melodrama (and even a bit of sex) - but it's about as Cassavetean as it could be, taking themes that are important to Cassavetes (or would be) and expressing them through the medium of unabashed pulp. (I'm not the only Cassavetes fan I know who has great fondness for this film). And Hank McCain's a lot easier to root for than poor doomed Cosmo, too, I'll tellya, and Falk and Rowlands are pretty damned good, too! BTW, fans of the film should check out Mike Patton's terrific ""reading"" of the theme song on the extended, Tzadik version of John Zorn's BIG GUNDOWN.",1274832000,13,3172,4.652406417112299
4155139,4,B003M986UM,"Giuliano Montaldo was known for directing  the Italian-French-German heist film with a great cast including Edward G. Robinson and Janet Leigh 1967's ""Grand Slam.""  It was a kind of poor man's ""Rififi"" set partially in Brazil and was quite carefully worked out and clever ending.  It was somewhat a success.  In 1970, he got a great cast lined up for a Mafia crimesploitation epic titled ""Machine Gun McCain"" and had the idea to cast John Cassavetes as the lead and added Gena Rowlands and Peter Falk to the cast with Britt Ekland for scenery and Blue Underground put it out now in blu-ray.  Montaldo is quite versatile but again the end result is a poor man's expose on violence and becomes a bit underwhelming.  But the blu-ray is cheap enough and you could do worse for it.  You may want to hold out for the original films these two cookies get cut from.

4155143,3,B003M986UM,"John Cassavettes, Peter Falk and Gena Rowlands co-star in another of their lacerating studies of the everyday despair at the heart of the American dream in Machine Gun McCain... Nah, just kidding. Giuliano Montaldo's relentlessly nihilistic thriller sees Cassavettes sprung from jail by the son he's only seen twice in his life and holds in contempt as a small timer to pull a Vegas casino heist which has really been masterminded by Peter Falk's rising mobster. Unfortunately Falk, who does a neat line in channelling early Bogart here, finds out that the casino in question is owned by his mob bosses and tries to call off the heist, but McCain has ideas of his own...

It's a good looking and stylish film, but that isn't enough to compensate for the absence of anyone to root for: everyone here is a self-centred bastard callously using everyone and anyone else. Unfortunately, McCain, played with a typical bad-taste-in-his-mouth sneer and smoke-in-his-eyes half-squint by Cassavettes, simply isn't an interesting enough bastard to overcome his callous indifference to violence - he's the kind of man who'll smile at a hatcheck girl while planting a diversionary bomb that could kill her and who registers no emotion when those supposedly closest to him are killed until the unconvincing ending. Like all the characters, he exists in a world outside the law and morality, where it's the mob who have their own covert police force and hold their own trials and executions: the sole representative of the forces of law and order is a Vegas sheriff who is easily dissuaded from investigating a series of bombings and leave it to the gangsters to sort out among themselves.

While you certainly can't accuse it of glamorising criminals despite its passive acceptance of their sociopathic amorality, it does make it hard to care, especially since the action scenes are more efficient than inspired and the writing is pretty perfunctory. Still, it benefits from a good cast - aside from Rowlands decent cameo near the end, Florinda Bolkan, Gabriele Ferzetti, Luigi Pistilli and Britt Ekland are in there as well, the latter in a particularly thankless role - and Ennio Morricone comes up with a memorable but rarely used theme for its anti-hero. Blue Underground's 2.35:1 widescreen Blu-ray is an excellent transfer with English and Italian soundtracks, with US and Italian trailers and an interview with the director as extras. Two-an-a-half stars.",1351555200,3,2448,5.102244389027431
4155144,4,B003M986UM,"I want to love this film, but I can't.  There are no bigger fans of Cassavetes, Falk, and Rowlands than me.  And to see any one of them, I would enthusiastically buy any movie whatsoever, and here you have all three of them.  The rest of the casting also is quite good.  The problem is the story.  It's very trite, very thin, and leaves the finest actors of their generation with very little to work with.  It's full of cliches, not necessarily a bad thing, but cliches that are so very badly executed.  After about a hundred years of filming bank robberies and getaways, it's not easy to make them look this silly and unbelievable.  If you want to see the same story done and done right, watch Steve McQueen's The Getaway.  I don't regret buying it, but it is as if the director stopped filming, not when the movie was over, but because he had no more film.  If it was 60 minutes longer, it would have been a much better movie.  And how many movies can you say that about?",1340323200,,973,4.291208791208791
4155145,4,B003M986UM,"Blue Underground ought to be lauded for bringing this B-Movie classic back to life. It stars Peter Falk as an intractable and power-hungry mobster, Cassavetes as an unstoppable gun-for-hire and Gena Rowlands as his long-lost moll. With a story and cast like this, it's one of the undiscovered treasures of low-rent Hollywood from the 70's. It also stars Britt Ekland, but, only in the sense that she's on camera for a good part of the film, she brings almost nothing to the role other than her stunning good looks. This would have been a much better film if Rowlands has taken her role, but, that's part of the charm of this film, it's untapped potential.

On another note, the transfer of this is solid. Not amazing, a little washed out in some places, but clearly a labor of love. This is also reflected in the menu itself where...well, I don't want to spoil it. Suffice it to say it brought a huge smile to my face.

4155147,4,B003M986UM,"""Machine Gun McCain"" is the thinking person's gangster movie. Perhaps it is John Cassavetes' brooding performance that brings this edge to director Giuliano Mondaldo's thrilling film. Peter Falk is no sympathetic Columbo here and it's great to see Gena Rowlands in a cameo that is the best performance in the film. You will remember Gena long after the closing credits. Montaldo knows how to make films like this and this is one of his best. The climax is a bottler. Ennio Morricone's score is a major asset, as always.",1291161600,,519,4.842696629213483
8400260,4,B003M986UM,"Machine Gun McCain, 1969 film

Charlie Adams is the new owner of a Las Vegas casino (which puts him in conflict with his competition). He is in charge of the entire West Coast and wants to invest in Las Vegas. But the owner Abe doesnt want to sell the Royal Towers. A man is released from prison, pardoned after twelve years. A friend meets him, they drive across the San Francisco Bay Bridge. McCain is needed for a job. He wanders around to see the tourist attractions, then meets a young woman, Irene. They become very friendly. They plan to knock over the Royal casino. But McCain wants to do it his way.

He visits and walks around the floor. McCains son talks to Adamo, is there a plot? Irene rolls the dice. Abe reports to the real owners in New York City.

Hank is told about his sons associates; he wants a machine gun. That night Frank meets his son, then he greets two strangers. Mr. De Marco visits Charlie the next day and invites him to Las Vegas. Then he says goodbye to his son.

Theyll make peace. Hank unpacks an addition to his red sedan. They show scenes of Las Vegas at night. Hank enters a casino and places small boxes in place. Then he dresses in a uniform. Bombs explode, firemen answer the call. Hank drives away in a red car. There are explosives in that casino. People scream and run! A masked fireman arrives. Gas grenades add to the confusion.

McCain goes to that boat and sees strange men, they have Irene. Irene doesnt walk all the wayto the boat. Other men arrive in cars, they are armed. It ends.

This story reminds me of High Sierra but with a different ending. Stealing from organized crime is not a good career move. The mob knows the likely suspects, they are not hampered by rules and regulations.",1497916800,,2764,4.487077534791252

8400266,5,B003M986UM,"I owned this DVD (Italian version) for a short while and was blown over by this movie.  The premise/plot was fairly basic - lone hood hits a casino owned by the wrong cats - but the style of cinematography and the quality of both the acting and editing made it (IMO) an outstanding example of stylish late `60s/'70s cinema.

The Blue Underground blu-ray expands this experience significantly.  Instantly, you're hit by an avalanche of authentic film grain that adds texture and mood to the location scenes of LA, `Frisco and especially Vegas.  Dig those gritty neon lights!

At times the picture, especially facial features, look a tad soft but that's probably reflective of the source and doesn't really detract from the enjoyment.  It's a gritty urban late `60s picture - and this transfer captures that perfectly.

Also, the acting quality is very high - Cassavettes, Falk, Eckland...OK she wasn't much of an actress but as an icon/sex symbol, they sure don't make glamour gals like her anymore.  Beats Christina Hendricks any day of the week.

Bottom line:  this is another Blu-Ray winner that illustrates the format's massive superiority over DVD.  I recommend this to any fan of movies of that era who want to see it done authentically.
