7976998,5,B00007JZO8,"*I had also plot-reviewed the ""complete series"" edition, so points made there may overlap here (being the same exact show).  Also, the plot (no spoilers) and themes will be common to the other volumes (3 volumes total in this series), but will make mention of unique DVD aspects pertaining to their respective volume.*

""Chance Pop Session"" (some may know it as ""Chance Triangle Session"", just to avoid confusion) is a wonderful 2001 anime series from the same studio that brought you other musical themed anime such as ""Nana"" and ""Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad"".  Compared to the other two mentioned, it is a much lighter fare.  But even so, it does have a good amount of depth and is amazingly uplifting.

FOR CONCERNED PARENTS AND FOLKS:
There is nothing to worry about in this film content-wise.  No nudity, no coarse language, no fan service, not even a hint of innuendo, no real violence.  The 3 girls being pop idols do wear clothes that are similar in cut (pertaining to size) to ballet outfits with their ""Older Sister"", Reika, often wearing performance tights.  But, all in all, it's really clean and conservative on those counts.

MOVING ON...

PLOT (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS):
""Chance Pop Session"" is a wonderful show about how 3 young girls from completely different backgrounds can come together, almost like fate, to achieve a common goal.  It highlights teamwork and how their unique lives contribute to the wonderful whole (how much more unique can u get with bringing together a Church choir girl, a street musician, and a rich aristocrat).  An orchestra conductor wrote that in order for a musician to become good, he must be a student of life...in other words allow his life experiences to color the music he plays.  ""Chance Pop Session"" really illustrates that well.  It is a good tale of perseverance and finding your purpose and reason for doing something...to find something greater than yourself.  The show itself is very, very predictable, but then again, I don't think it was meant to be a show of controversy, intrigue, or scandal...just a show about life, fate, and connections.  Still, there are some twists...and some very deep and sorrowful moments.  It's kinda like normal life...no exaggerations, no pizzaz except that which comes with living.

VOICE ACTING:
I personally prefer the Japanese Dubs (with subtitles) over the English Dubs in this case (which is rare for me).  But as I say that, I must say the English voice actors did have a good script and acted their parts very very well.  In fact, I would probably have watched it with English dubs instead.  It's just there's a certain voice type that I can't really stand...and they employed that kind of voice for ONE of the characters.  So again, I only prefer the Japanese dubs not because it's inherently ""better"" or anything like that. I just can't stand one voice type.  Personal preference, completely.  Oh, and it's important to note, that the Japanese/subtitles does use a lot of Japanese mannerisms that may or may not be fully understood for some people.  The English dubbing script stays very true and tight to the original Japanese script, but also is more easily relatable/accessible to a western audience.

MUSIC:
Music is the theme of this show, and therefore hard to avoid looking over.  Personally, I really liked the music a lot...some favorites in this one.  The only important thing to mention is that the idol song list is kinda small and is often replayed A LOT.  I was cool with it, but I know some others would prefer a larger song list as found in ""The Idol M@ster"" (another good - and more recent - anime about idol groups).

DVD EPISODE COUNT:
This is volume 2/3 for the series and it carries episodes 6-9

SPECIAL FEATURES:
This volume basically consists of more gallery of character/production sketches, Japanese Promo Spots, clean opening/closing MV, and an 8-page booklet on ""How to Be a Popstar: Session 2""

ALL IN ALL:
This show is a wonderful addition to my ""music themed"" shows/movies library.  Very encouraging and uplifting.  What's more, it really is about the music and finding a deeper reason to do it.  A very important series, I think, for aspiring professional musicians.  One thing you learn when you enter the professional/higher field of music, is that it takes much more than a ""passive"" or hobby-like ""love"" for it to make it.  It requires that you develop an even stronger attachment and purpose to music...something that is even greater than yourself.  This show illustrates that well.",1344297600,,4519,4.897368421052631
7976999,4,B00007JZO8,"As other reviewers have noted, I also found the main plot of the series very predictable. However, this ""feel-good"" story is well-paced and held my interest.

All three DVDs have extras consisting of character sketches, production backgrounds, Japanese promo spots, and clean opening & closing.

Packaging: This one has the second installment on ""How to be a Popstar."" The eight-page, saddle-stitched, four-color, glossy booklet focuses on clothing basics and is definitely written for teenaged girls. The booklet gives practical guidelines for buying and wearing clothes, not just formal wear for performing in concerts but also casual wear for school. Parents would approve of its contents. Staying healthy and exercising and not falling victim to the latest fads are just a few of the topics. Also included is a sticker sheet of eight stickers, three of which are of Yuki and three of Jun, who is the overly competitive ""bad girl"" of the series.

ADV Films suggests a viewing audience of 12 and up, which I concur. There is no strong language, nudity, or violence. However, the lyrics of one song, Woo Yeah Woo Ah, implies premarital sex.",1104105600,2,1141,5.090909090909091
7977000,5,B00007JZO8,"Okay, why do I continue to compare this series with Princess Nine?  Because of the startling similarities between the series.  One story is about becoming the best team in Japanese High School Baseball history (and some of the characters in that series share a surprising past!), and Chance Pop Session is about three girls striving to be the best singers in their industry (and all share a suprising past!).
Chance Pop Session, Volume 2, reveals part of the unknown past that two of the girls share.  The discovery of the secret past, as well as weathering a personal tragedy, serves as a catalyst to unite Akari, Yuki, and Nozomi as a top-knotch singing group newly dubbed ""R3"" (a resonance of three voices in harmony).  They blend and wow the judges in a difficult competition to discover new talent, beating out a former group candidate and rival and overcoming an embarrasing setback during their performance.  After the competition, the young women continue to practice their craft, despite the objections and continued pressures of Nozomi's parents.  However, as R3 climb to the top of the charts, more elements of their shared past is revealed.
We also discover Reika's past and her motivation to stay on top as a superstar performer.  Will R3 get in her way?  Or will she keep her place in the spotlight?
Again, the repetition of certain key songs in the series may get to some viewers, but the tunes are real catchy (if you don't mind bubblegum J-pop songs).  The mystery deepens and the fun continues in this second volume.  If you've seen the first volume of Chance Pop Session, don't stop now!  It's getting goooooood ;-)",1060992000,,1634,4.82078853046595
