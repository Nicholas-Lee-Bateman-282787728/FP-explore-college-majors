8286470,5,B001CB96SS,"If this DVD is still available, grab it! The world outside you will never be the same. Like much of Chopra's work, it is timeless. I left with the feeling that I attended the entire workshop. The DVD also provides great notes (in PDF) for reference. Some of the links are no longer active, the most notable one is for primordial sound meditation, but the DVD is well worth the purchase. I bought it after viewing a library copy.",1373932800,,428,4.430379746835443

8286472,5,B001CB96SS,"Another great and inspiring work of Deepak!

Hearing and viewing Deepak in this wonderful setting, transports the message in a highly dense and emotion rich fashion.

Fulfillment of desire is not about chasing, pushing or even planing on. ""Let the universe handle the details"" is the final conclusion when you do it in the way Deepaks hows us in this program.

For all hard nosed, real world people that do not believe in such spiritual wishy washy stuff. That's perfectly OK. I also do not believe that man can fly, or speak into a little box with flatrate and somebody 100 miles away can hear it. Pure phantasy!

Get it & you'll love it :-)",1369008000,,642,4.556521739130435
