7851938,2,6303632459,"To start with the positive things, ""Suspicious Agenda"" is based on a good story idea. Someone is taking the law into his own hands and killing criminals who have somehow avoided being imprisoned due to loopholes in the justice system. A police captain forms a special task force of six police detectives to find the killer, and we see what happens as this task force goes to work.

However, in reality the police captain is convinced that the vigilante killer must be a policeman, and he has selected the six detectives on the police force with the most serious discipline problems. The captain is assuming that the killer is one of these six detectives, and that he will soon make a mistake and reveal himself.

Very nice story idea.

Unfortunately, the style of the movie is constantly way over the top, and this spoils any enjoyment.

The action is over the top and the situations are totally unrealistic. Nobody does anything calmly and intelligently, instead everyone is constantly in a state of high excitement and the characters are always yelling at each other and picking fights with each other and acting like unruly kindergarten children.

Unless you like a movie where everything is exaggerated and unrealistic I'm recommending that you give ""Suspicious Agenda"" a pass.
