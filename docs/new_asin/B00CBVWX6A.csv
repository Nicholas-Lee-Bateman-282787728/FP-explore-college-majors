5713458,5,B00CBVWX6A,"This film is a great example of how good writing, acting, and camerawork can compensate for small budgets - in the end, no amount of special effects or big budgets can compete with a good story. Dead Weight has a great story with a cool twist and does a good job of focusing on the human side of the apocalypse. Their dvd is also really complete, hell - they even have French subtitles, how they did it, who knows? The directors and actors all do an awesome job and the bleak midwestern winter scenery really sets the tone for the story.",1387324800,5,537,4.326732673267327
5713459,5,B00CBVWX6A,Ths is the best movie I have seen in over a dozen years. Great plot and unique story line.  This movie must be seen by the masses.,1387238400,3,130,3.814814814814815
5713460,5,B00CBVWX6A,"Charlie (Joe Belknap) is traveling through the wilderness to find his girlfriend, Samantha (Mary Lindberg), after civilization is destroyed by widespread biological attacks. He must try to survive while dealing with other survivors and his own emotional burdens.

The post-apocalyptic world is a well-trod staple of the horror genre. Some would say, not without good reason, that it has been trod just a few too many times. But ""Dead Weight"" succeeds with this theme by making it the background rather than the foreground of the story. This is, in fact, a romance story disguised as horror, adding an emotional level that most horror films lack.

The sheer level of acting talent going into this production is remarkable. Some of those involved are professionals, who spend their every waking moment acting. Some (in fact, most) are amateurs, making their theatrical debut here. And with one or two easily overlooked exceptions, all the performances come across as strong and bold. I have seen my fair share of independent films, and this one takes talent to the next level.

Directing and cinematography are top notch. A few shots seem inspired by some of the better directors out there, or even bad directors (M. Night Shyamalan) when they were at their peak. I have lived in Wisconsin for three decades and have hardly thought of it as beautiful, but the camera has brought out the best and the bleakest that winter has to offer, depending on what the scene called for. I am told that due to snow one scene had to be moved from a field to a barn, but this turned out to be a stroke of good luck -- the scene in question is among the most ominous in the film, and a field would be more difficult to capture the angles and shadows needed for the terror that ensues.

And although the film is quite dark at times (with the threat of infection, murder or rape always on the horizon) there is just the right sprinkling of humor in there to keep it from getting too dark, but not too much humor that the film would devolve into a parody of itself. The jokes and their delivery seemed inspired by the early films of Kevin Smith (""Clerks"" and ""Mallrats""), and based on what I know of director John Pata, that seems completely appropriate.

Likewise, the balance of ""geek"" and ""non-geek"" is pretty stable. The creators are well-known geeks who thrive in the world of comics and cheesy movies (which I mean in the nicest possible way). Yet, they never let this get in the way with endless homages and pointless references. Yes, Charlie is a comic reader. But he is also a fighter (you think just because a guy reads comics he can't start something?). Aside from the ""Arnold moment"", the film's only real nod is in giving Samantha the surname MacReady, which I took to be a subtle reference to ""The Thing"" (another story about survival in the snow).

I say in my headline that this was ""Dawn of the Dead"" meets ""Blue Valentine"". I think the ""DotD"" references speaks for itself. But the ""Blue Valentine"" reference might not. What really sold the film was the juxtaposition of Charlie's life getting progressively worse with flashback shots of it getting progressively better. Not all romances are good ones (as Lady Gaga has so aptly reminded us). And this film nails that.

Sadly, if I have to say anything bad about the film it is in the chemistry. Joe Belknap was great as a survivor and was an admirable lead character, a flawed and tragic anti-hero. But his chemistry with Mary Lindberg was just not there... the weakest scenes are the two of them interacting. Lindberg was great in every moment, but Belknap seemed to struggle with how to present himself as a boyfriend.

All in all, a strong first showing from Pata and Bartlett (ignoring the shorter, funnier ""Better Off Undead""). Whether they are planning to go for a big distribution deal, or quickly dive into their next project, I wish these two the success they deserve. Until now, the best thing to come out of Wisconsin was the beer and cheese. ""Dead Weight"" gives those two fattening staples a run for their money.",1387238400,9,4071,4.69187675070028
5713461,5,B00CBVWX6A,Dead Weight excels in showing people making real decisions and having honest reactions in a grim apocalypse.  Solid bittersweet humor and genuine thoughtfulness in the writing make this stand out among the other independents.

5713464,3,B00CBVWX6A,"A movie less about zombies and more about the truth of individuals. The two focal characters are a male and female in a relationship, the male is a archetype ""self serving slacker"" while the female is an archetype ""group think worker"". Apocalypse hits she is at work, and he has just woken up, eating cereal in his Pajama's and a robe. The story is put forth as a love story of one mans devotion to his relationship; but on a deeper level it shows how people even when people change at their core they stay the same. The movie has a  subplot of ethics and accountability but it is not preachy.

Spoiler:

Yes they do find each other but the ending is akin to Shogun movies, were in the end is a reflection of the path one choose to walk to get to that point. I would not doubt the lead character has probably been using and manipulating and discarding people subtly through out in his life for a long time, either out of selfishness, laziness and possibly a co-dependent nature.",1507939200,,978,4.392265193370166

5713474,1,B00CBVWX6A,"*SPOILER ALERT* First thing, Charlie the main character is completely unlikable, but I think they were trying to make him relatable to a small section of males in the audience, you know the ones who think they're a ""nice guy"" and that their misogyny is funny. The way he treats Samantha and the other characters is completely inexcusable. How Samantha didn't just break up with him during any of their conversations where he acted like a total tool shed is beyond me. He blames her for everything, accepting no responsibility for himself. I was not sad or horrified when his character died, in fact I was very happy that he got what he deserved. I was more sad that Samantha's character wasted any time on him at all.
Second, the acting was passable, but the characters made some decisions that were just nonsensical. Instead of fighting off some zombies (no actual zombies, just footsteps from upstairs) in the farm house, the group of survivors just abandon a bunch of food and run for the hills. I'm sorry, how have you gotten by all this time without having a confrontation with a zombie and survived? Ooo, I killed this guy to protect the female in the group, but let's not explain that to anyone because obviously they won't trust us any more because it's not a good enough reason to kill someone. I'll just bludgeon this nice old couple so they don't ruin my plans of tricking this group I'm with to go to a place they probably wouldn't want to go and then I'll just stand over their bludgeoned bodies and be surprised when the group abandons me. Absolute unbelievable nonsense.
Third, no zombies. What kind of zombie horror movie doesn't have any zombies until the last scene, and then they aren't even believable zombies, they literally didn't have on zombie costumes or make up, it's like they didn't even try.

Bottom line, don't waste your time on this extremely boring and pointless movie, there are far better low-budget zombie films out there that are actually entertaining.",1494633600,,1989,4.731988472622478

First, I thought it was interesting the main character had to go from being a lazy, selfish couch potato to a zombie fighter to survive.  I also thought it was interesting he realized early on he was not the kind of guy to survive on his own, so he needed to manipulate a group of better-prepared survivors to get him to his destination.",1492905600,,485,4.260869565217392

Coming from a ""Post Apocalyptic-Zombie Film"" Fanatic, this was an unusual spin on the average film of that genre... but that's what made the film pleasing to watch.

I don't expect great cinematography (it was bad) or beautiful soundtracks ( there was none)  But at least give it a decent story.  This effort was slow, with acting only a family member would love, with an abysmal script.  I clicked on the ratings to try to figure out how there could have been an average of 3 stars for this and I saw several positive reviews among the lot, including mentions of the twist at the end.

That is harder to do, to feel an enemy without actually showing them. Some beautiful scenic cuts. Flashbacks handled well without being too obvious as to what was being accomplished.
Are there some low budget aspects? Yes. Some beginning acting, perhaps some obvious dialogue. But I ended up caring about the people, feeling the tensions and fears they felt when coming across others out there.
This is now a favorite low budget ""zombie"" movie for me. More of an apocalypse movie than a zombie movie. Give it a chance. Not a bloodfest but perhaps more realistic if there was ever the problem of civilization breaking down.",1490054400,,771,4.676470588235294

The cinematography does an excellent job of conveying the isolation and desolation of the world.  There are some fantastic performances, tight direction and statements to be made about human nature.

5713492,4,B00CBVWX6A,I found this movie to be a refreshing take on the zombie genre.  It was very low budget but the plot was solid and very interesting.

I didn't plan on watching it, but I was soon drawn in very quickly to the story. It starts out very ordinary, and slowly reveals itself throughout the remainder of the film. At the start you would never guess that this was a ""zombie movie"". It comes across as more of a romantic drama at first, but as it progresses little things start to occur that are more and more disturbing. I won't give it all away but the ending is unexpected and fantastic. I was really shocked and blown away by it. I did not see it coming at all, which is great filmmaking. I thought the acting was very believable as well -and top notch for a small indie film made by local Wisconsin actors and crew. The guy who played ""Charlie"" ,in particular, was amazing,. He really captivated me and was very sincere and believable. Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this film. You will not be disappointed and I guarantee that once you start watchng you won't be able to stop until the end. This film deserves a much wider audience.

The film was boring. The most exciting part was the September calendar with 31 days on it. I thought the film was going to go somewhere other than straight down the tubes. While traveling, Charlie has a bunch of boring meaningless flashbacks, to make us wonder why we are still watching this.

5713499,5,B00CBVWX6A,"I saw Dead Weight in 2012 and have been telling people about it ever since. Do I like it? I bought it twice, so yeah. After I walked by a table with a couple of guys selling their film, I was immediately captivated by the cinematography that was being shown on the 10 inch screen. This looked too well done for a project that didn't have a big studio behind it. Needless to say,  it was better than I thought.

Dead Weight is a survivor movie more than a zombie film. With dark humor and a little romance, it surprised me with the connection I made with the characters which is in large part due to the writing and editing of the film. Unlike most post apocalyptic films, it is the journey of a group not only trying to survive starvation, the elements and other survivors but with a specific destination that keeps them going.  Specifically, Charlie who is going to make this destination no matter what in hopes of reuniting with his girlfriend Samantha.  With no confirmation that his girlfriend Samantha is even there, Charlie becomes obsessed and nothing will stop him. If you are an obstacle or defy the path, you're dead weight.

Most horror stories focus on the monsters that are made by bug, bird or whatever outbreak the writers decide to develop. This film DOES have monsters and they are man made. The only difference is these monsters know how not to be monsters and still act less human than the things in the dark.

John Pata and Adam Bartlett do a superb job of directing and writing with editing that is award worthy. I truly look forward to what these gentlemen will show us next. Joe Belknap does a fantastic job for a first time acting role.  Aaron Christensen, Michelle Courvais and Mary Lindberg give spectacular supporting performances as does the entire cast.

As I said in the beginning,  this is a survivor movie.  Surviving the elements, surviving your fellow survivors, surviving exhaustion and ultimately yourself. I recommend Dead Weight as a superb horror drama.",1440892800,3,1992,4.6657142857142855

5713508,5,B00CBVWX6A,"This is a pretty great character driven film that really is about the most terrifying monster during a Zombie Apocalypse or frankly any sort of disaster - humans. Let me address the two problems most mentioned in the really pointless 1 star reviews on here -

1. The acting.
Yes there are a few actors that are first timers and it shows in their scenes but that just isn't the case for the most part. Charlie, played by Joe Belknap, portrays his role perfectly. He's hanging onto personal issues that are creating inner turmoil that prevents him from doing the right thing throughout. That's not the easiest role to play with the subtlety of emotional switches and Joe pulls that off. Aaron Christensen and Michelle Courvais as Thomas and Meredith respectively, are on the other hand seasoned actors and they nearly steal the show as riveting side characters that truly help guide the direction of the film.

2. Not enough happens/there are no zombies.
If you're looking for a creature feature, yeah you'll be disappointed. Blame the idiot distributors for changing the cover art to portray something completely different than the story for this one.

The thing is, stuff DOES happen. It's NOT about a zombie overrun. You've SEEN that a million times. Go pick up some Romero or something if that's what you want. This is about people. How they react to such an event and how their own personal demons can play a major role in whether they survive or not. It IS a slow burner, but for all of the right reasons. The editing (award winning from the 2012 Elvira's Horror Hunt/HorrorHound Weekend Awards) puts you back in Charlie's head, thinking about his relationship with Samantha and how he got into the mess he's in when you're watching... but the slow burn makes sense. You need to see him unravel a bit. You need to see his interactions with the people along the way to make sense of what he is heading towards at the end. It's a dark, sad, depressing world Charlie lives in and this movie conveys that perfectly. I won't even rattle off how amazing it is to pull off such a beautiful, professionally shot film on the budget they had because it's irrelevant. The film looks fantastic and in a good 90% of the scenes, you'd never know that there were first time actors involved in some of them. This film is a credit to Independent Horror and how far it has come. Long gone are the days where ""Indie"" meant 'some dude shooting grainy crap in his backyard'.

This is absolutely, positively, the WORST (so-called) Zombie Apocalypse movie ever made! (And I've seen boatloads of them!) Not just low-budget, you'd swear that there was NO budget when they made this film! Not even a hint of the undead until almost 1:05 into the movie, and even then, there are only distant growls. We don't actually SEE the undead until the very final scene, and from what I saw then, that's probably a very good thing! (No special effects, not even any makeup on them, laughable!) As others have stated, the bulk of this film is a handful of people just sitting around and talking....and believe me, the dialogue is not very good, either. It's truly hard to believe just how monumentally awful this movie is! It's almost physically painful to watch it.....you could actually use it to torture people with, it might be more effective than waterboarding!

I like Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland as much as the next guy, but less than clever attempts at recycling their magic has found my interest in the Zombie genre eroding.

After hearing strong praise about Dead Weight on the festival circuit by those ""in the know,"" I finally got a chance to see it and I'm glad I did. Less of a zombie film and more of a horror drama, Dead Weight is a film that swims against the current. Taking place amidst the beautifully desolate landscape of a Minnesota winter, Dead Weight marks new territory, making its own path, with a slow, creeping sense of dread that trails all the way back to the original Night of the Living Dead. Characters are given dimension here. The importance of the group is stressed. Society is still necessary, especially in the apocalypse where survival hinges upon what you can bring to the group and what the group can provide for you. Dynamics not usually explored in most direct-to-video zombie films these days. While relieved, at times, by the occasional dark bit of humor, it's this Grapes of Wrath style perspective culminating in a climatically brutal loss that makes Dead Weight a standout in the genre.

If you are interested in how humans may act during a catastrophic event, then this movie is for you.  The only bad review that I do agree with is that the cover art could be misleading.  Having a baseball bat would have been a better choice.  Now on to my original review...

This movie is an excellent view into the behaviors of human kind.  This film is in the same venue as Threads, another excellent catastrophic event movie, where the horror of the event is always in the background while the horror of human behavior is put squarely into view. Even though it is a low budget film, much of the production is good quality.  Like any film there are some downsides, but those are minimal when you put the whole film into perspective.

5713533,5,B00CBVWX6A,"Im going to start by being up front and honest. I saw this film in a private screening before its original release. I had interviewed John Pata and Adam Bartlett for a Horror Podcast I had worked for at the time.  Their love of the movie they made, with their friends, was hard not to get wrapped up into.

Its been several years since I last watched the movie and recently gave it another viewing to have the movie fresh in my mind for this review.

I can see where others complained about the acting, but note this is an independent film. It isn't something from any big name company it was truly made on a shoestring budget and yes it may show in the film.

This is one of those truly independent films that put a lot of effort in trying to make the best movie they could. The movie made use of a local airport, restaurant and backwoods of Wisconsin. It was shot in a manner to help show the passage of time and thus was shot in order for the bulk of the film.

The great thing about this film is you see the plight and loneliness that is brought on by the disaster that has swept the country. There is a scene showing how hopeless some people felt when the characters come across a car with a dead family inside.  There are scenes where the only woman in the group is threatened by strangers and just maybe those around her.  It makes you wonder who they can really trust. Even the core group at points seems ready to turn on each other. The backwoods emptiness and foreboding just adds additional depth to the settings.

The key thing with the film is you need to get past what is not shown and look at the story. Viewers are given a story that shows how the depth of love for one woman can drive a man to do things he wouldnt do if the world was normal.

Viewers have to wonder, would they do all that Charlie does to get back to his Samantha? She at times put herself in front of their partnership but Charlie loves her and does all he can to find out if she is alive. Could anyone of us do some of those things Charlie does if we faced the same tragedies he does?

I know in todays world of Zombie movies, and television shows, we want to see the things that are hunting mankind. We want to see their emotionless shuffles and deathly bodies. In Dead Weight much of that is left to the imagination till late into the film. It is up to the viewer to get the sense of fear from the world and the way people hide in the backwoods to avoid confrontations on how bad things have gotten.  Even the sounds from the unseen spaces of a possibly deserted home can be enough to send the group running for their lives.

If you can allow yourself to escape from the in your face zombies we have come to see on TV and in movies you will find a well told story. Its a story of how one man can go from being the nicest caring man around to a man who will do whatever it takes to make it to the love of his life. A story that will have you questioning the bit of humanity that may survive in a world such as the film shows and on what side youd be on.",1391385600,6,3041,4.083892617449664
5713534,5,B00CBVWX6A,"This is not a highly polished, big budget movie. This is not a movie full of zombies and constant action.

This is a movie made by a small group of people, with a small budget. A ""Labor of love"" and all of that.

It is about a group surviving in a post-apocalyptic world, travelling through northern Wisconsin. It is about how that group interacts within itself and with the people they meet, and the moral choices they make, and choose not to make.

I give the movie 5 stars because I really enjoy it, I've watched it many times now and it makes me smile every time. And because this movie introduced me to the world of small budget ""labor of love"" movies, especially indee horror. Movies that aren't all smooth and polished and made bland by committee decisions. Movies that hold the maker's intent true, love it or hate it. There's a lot of great creative movies out there untainted by the craving for mass appeal, this is one of them.

5713538,4,B00CBVWX6A,"Post-apocalyptic movies and zombies have always gone hand-in-hand. The apocalypse doesn't necessarily imply zombies, but there's always an element of it there when you assume the dead are rising from their graves. First time writer/directors Adam Bartlett and John Pata do something interesting with that concept, though, by assuming zombies (or infected, as they're called here) but never showing them and, instead, making the entire conflict exist between the survivors. It's not the first time such a thing's been done, but Dead Weight does a pretty good job with the concept.

A plague has turned humanity against itself and the few survivors must deal with both the infected and the other survivors, who are now capable of anything. As we watch Charlie (Joe Belknap) walk the road with four friends toward a small Wisconsin town, we see the rise and tragic fall of his relationship with Samantha (Mary Lindberg), the woman he's travelling to meet. When they finally reunite, they both realize that the choices they've made has rendered a reconciliation impossible.

On a certain level, Dead Weight resembles a stand-alone issue of The Walking Dead, one in which we get all new characters in a familiar situation just to see how fresh personalities react to it. In this case, though, it would be an issue written by somebody other than Robert Kirkland because even though Bartlett and Pata show some writing and directing skill in their debut, the dialog and situation just don't carry the weight of the comic.

Mostly, that's because they try to make the romance between Charlie and Samantha as important as the rest of the story. That's certainly a conscious choice that just doesn't work as well as they wanted it to. It's told through flashbacks and out of order in a way that is stylistically interesting, but not terribly effective and takes away from the suspense.

To their credit, though, Belknap and Linberg do quite well in their respective debuts. They have a certain amount of tense chemistry between them and a couple of the more emotional scenes are really effective, but seem like they belong in another film. The rest of the cast, of varying levels of experience, are all pretty good, but the nature of the story makes so many characters necessary that none of them get any time to breathe.

Bartlett and Pata show a fair bit of style in Dead Weight, as well. The main plot is filmed almost without color, with only the faintest blues and greys on screen, while the flashbacks are all shot brightly, with modern saturated tones. It's a cheap film, of course, but they make it work with the resources they have. And maybe it doesn't work as well as it could, but it is a worthy first effort that makes me excited for the future.

Dead Weight arrives from Horizon Movies on a DVD that is much stronger than movies like this would normally get. The 1.78:1 anamorphic image isn't anything particularly special, but it still looks pretty strong. It's sharp, with nice bright colors during the flashback sequences and good black levels in the dark rest of the film. Sound is good as well, with both surround and stereo sound and, though they sound pretty much identical, it's clear and sharp throughout. I suppose the surround track has a little bit of action in the rear channels, but it's not much to account for.

Extra features start with two audio commentaries. The first, with writer/directors Bartlett and Pata and if there's one thing you can't accuse them of lacking, it's enthusiasm. They talk animatedly about all aspects of the film, maybe a little too much so, but hey, it's their first film, so whatever. More conventional is the actors' commentary with Belknap and Lindberg, who go over much of the same material. It's interesting enough, if a little repetitive. A set of deleted and extended scenes display what they discuss was taken out in the commentaries. A twenty minute making-of featurette goes back over the same material and a trailer closes out the disc.

So what if it plays as much as a standalone installment of The Walking Dead and isn't the best indie horror movie you'll find? Dead Weight actually works pretty well, at least as far as post-apocalyptic romances are concerned. At times, the writing and direction are a little bit lacking, but the performances are pretty good and the writing/directing duo are just starting out and show a lot of promise.

5713541,4,B00CBVWX6A,"Straight from Wisconsin comes this fun and fresh Indie flick from Directors Adam Bartlett and John Pata. Going in to the review lets keep in mind that this is not a high budget, over the top special effects driven zombie movie. In fact, we see little of any zombies until the very end of the movie. The cool thing though, is that they aren't needed. Dead Weight is a love story wrapped in post apocalyptic, who do you trust when the world ends, zombie skin.

Charlie Russell (played by Joe Belknap) is a screen printer from Toledo, OH who loves comic books and relaxing in his pajamas. His girlfriend, Samantha (played wonderfully by newcomer Mary Lindberg) has recently taken an internship with a company in Minneapolis. One morning Joe gets a phone call from Samantha letting him know that her city, and possibly the country, is under attack. The two vow to meet up in Wausau, WI at the restaurant where their friends held their wedding rehearsal dinner. From there we follow Charlie on his journey to find his true love.

Awoken from a dream of the day the apocalypse began we see that Charlie, 45 days later, has joined up with four other survivors on his journey to Wisconsin. Not being comfortable in one place for too long they forge ahead into the harsh mid-western winter. Along the way, the movie flashes back to various events in Charlie and Samanthas relationship. The directors and actors do a nice job of revealing everything in Charlies head as he slowly began to worry about the couples future. Samantha moves away, Samantha gets offered a full time job, Samantha tries to talk Charlie into moving away from his hometown of Toledo All of these thoughts creep in to Charlies mind as he begins to unravel a little on the road to Wausau.

Throughout the movie, the group runs into the typical problems one figures one might experience after all hell breaks loose. The band of backwoods, deliverance type rednecks; the bitter cold as well as a lack of food. Its when the group runs into a nice older couple that things really turn for Charlie and his group. Betrayal, the breakdown of morality, trust and asking yourself what wouldnt you do to find your true love all come in to play during this movies run time.

Some of the acting is a little rough, but that was to be expected. The film looks great, has a nice score and features a pretty darn good story-line. Most of the actors were first timers but did a great job. Mary Lindberg (Samantha) was very believable as the adorable, funny girlfriend. Joe Belknap (Charlie) was funny at times and more likable as the movie progressed. Michelle Courvais and Aaron Christensen added a bit of acting chops to the film as both have previously been in horror movies. To judge this film against Hollywood horror films would be unfair. Was I entertained? Yes. Did the people that made this movie put 100% of their passion for film making into it (the girl who played Samantha also handled make-up)? Absolutely. Would I like to see more from Adam Bartlett and John Pata? Indeed.

Enjoy Dead Weight for what it is. An indie thriller with a smart script and a lot of heart. I give it 3.5 on the ThongScale and an overall score of 72.

8580092,3,B00CBVWX6A,"Not the most exciting zombie movie ever made, but it had some promise. I liked the idea of Charlie being so obsessed with getting to Wausau, but there could have been more action in between his leaving his GF and then finding her. Also some of the story lines didn't make a lot of sense, like why didn't the jerks who wanted the take the girl, think of a better plan, that just asking nicely? And Charlie was so close to Wausau when he dispatched the old couple that he could have just left rather than kill them,  and if he didn't get caught what was he planning on doing? I realize that people making dumb decisions is standard procedure in zombie movies but that was too stupid. The other thing was the explanation of the outbreak, sounds like it was a terrorist attack, a very effective terrorist attack that seems to have wiped out the USA and left Canada as the dominant military force in North America. Canada needs to build a wall. don't really understand how the US went down so easily.",1530489600,,995,4.407608695652174
8580093,1,B00CBVWX6A,Pretty boring - way too many other Zombie apocalypse movies out there - watch one of those instead,1522800000,,98,4.5
8580094,4,B00CBVWX6A,"I found this to be surprisingly good.  It was thought provoking and oddly enough didn't need to show the zombies for it to succeed as a zombie flick. Sure, some of it was rather stupid but most zombie movies are far, far worse than this.  The worst acting was Samantha's over the top giddiness.",1519171200,,294,4.425925925925926
8580095,3,B00CBVWX6A,"Zombie/infected films are all the rage these days and it takes a lot for a film to truly stand out among the herd. Dead Weight isn't that film. But what it does do is tell a decent story about a couple just as the viral/infected apocalypse begins and how their union ultimately ends. Yes, it drags on at times, yes, some of the acting is lackluster, yes the budget is so low that the audience never sees the infected until the very end and even then, it's not very convincing. But the two lead characters Charlie and Samantha are convincing enough when it matters. Joe Belknap does a good job playing Charlie, a character some in the audience could quickly learn to not like making the ending a plus if you fall into that camp and Mary Lindberg as Samantha who also gives a good performance considering the context of the story being told and the dirt low budget. I give it 3* mainly because the story is told in such a way that I was actually interested to see how it ended.",1517184000,,975,4.333333333333333
8580096,4,B00CBVWX6A,"Yes it's a zombie movie without the zombies - and it's low budget, but regardless it's a pretty heavy, crushing, human story. If you like suspenseful, atmospheric, slow burn horror you'll like this but if you're looking for Dawn of the Dead this ain't it.",1517011200,2,255,4.688888888888889
8580097,4,B00CBVWX6A,"Worth watching and good story line. If you are looking for zombies don't watch this one, but if you want a good enough story line then indulge. The acting is cheesy, but the twist at the end was very good. One of the best I have watched in awhile",1514764800,,246,4.040816326530612
8580098,2,B00CBVWX6A,"No guns, except for on empty pistol and an SKS at the very end? Is anyone sure this movie was actually made in the U.S. of A?",1513814400,,125,3.6666666666666665
8580099,2,B00CBVWX6A,"Weak acting, bad dialog, poor storyline and wasted too much time on the segmented backstory nonsense and that crap being presented in backward order as the story progress seemed an attempt to be cinematically clever but it just didn't work.",1510185600,,240,5.025
8580100,4,B00CBVWX6A,"Not what I was expecting, but still pretty good. It felt directionless at first, and I was getting disappointed, until it dawned on me that the whole film is a metaphor for dumping a low quality partner. At that point, around the half hour mark, it still wasn't a very eventful zombie movie, but I had become attuned to the fact it was rich with symbolism, and so I enjoyed it for that. Only four stars, because while all of this is true, I think there still could have been more zombies while maintaining the theme.",1509235200,,516,4.385416666666667
8580101,1,B00CBVWX6A,"A zombie movie, but without the zombies. So slow, it felt like an eternity watching. I now crave brains to replace the dead brain cells from sitting through this. Definitely had potential to be a good movie, just didn't have the budget to thrive.",1509148800,,246,4.613636363636363
