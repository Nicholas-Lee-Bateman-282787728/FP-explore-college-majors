8507187,5,B006ZRBE1Q,"Sometimes the quality of DVD's is not the same as when viewed on TV, but this version is clear and vivid with minimal grammatical errors in the subtitles.  This drama introduced me to the wonderful actor, Kim Rae Won, and I'm betting you will want to see more of his work after viewing this production.  He has a great range and can be playful, funny, sad, and EXASPERATING, but his character will hold your interest.  On a sad note, I understand that the female lead, Jung De Bin, who was delightful in her role, ended her life shortly after this production.  I wholeheartedly recommend this product.",1365292800,,601,4.6415094339622645
