This film has a VERY creative story line -- very original and not one I've seen before.  The acting is top drawer and the special effects are noteworthy -- I think this film has the best ghosts/apparitions I've ever seen -- ethereal, realistic, scary, and credible.  Judging by the title, ""Frightfest"" I was expecting a quasi-low-budget, quasi-predictable film . . . but NO WAY!!  What a pleasant surprise to find an elegant, visually rich, well acted, innovative film with all the elements of a well-done ghost story delivered VERY well.  Highly recommended.

8404812,1,B003T04NE2,"If I had known this was sub-titled or dubbed,  I would not have wasted my movie.  I lasted all but 5 minutes into this.  2.1 (English) sound on a 7.1 surround system sucks!  Acting & Voices were sub par",1398988800,,202,4.102564102564102
8404813,5,B003T04NE2,"I definitely liked this movie even from the fact that the people didn't speak English but if you have subtitles, you're good to go. Still entertaining and keeps you interested.",1391990400,2,176,4.9
8404814,3,B003T04NE2,"As if the Catholic church doesn't have a bad enough rap, here comes a movie about even more dark little secrets that priests are won't to keep.  Decades ago in Spain, there was a newsreel company named Noticiario Documentales (aka No-Do).  For some reason the Catholic priests used this film company to film events that were never meant for public viewing.  The films were then locked away in secret places and used only to educate other priests and train them to combat all things demonic - fakes, miracles and third suppositions.  But sometimes they filmed events not even meant for other priests to see - occupational hazards, I guess you would call them.  And that is where the house in this movie comes in.  The movie isn't really about just a haunting.  It's a statement about the atrocities that are committed in the name of the church, especially the Catholic church, who seem about as trustworthy as Congress these days.  Oh the secrets they keep.

The performances were pretty good all around.  Not really too many scary moments except for one involving doll parts, and an ending with an entity that came right out of the remake of, strangely enough, another movie called The Haunting, a remake of the old black and white film based on the novel by Shirley Jackson.  The CGI spirit was almost an exact copy of the other film's ghost.  So no, not too many scary bits here.  It didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out the situation with the woman's daughter either.  Nothing really original here, but it's worth a view nonetheless.",1311465600,8,1544,4.712686567164179
8404815,3,B003T04NE2,"I love haunted house movies since i was a kid so when i found out Fangoria was doing one I was really excited.  When i got the movie the actors seemed passionless I noticed it was dubbed and it seem all wrong, they can't possibly be saying this its boring!!! This is a really bad situation and they sound like they are just reading off the lines. Finally I tried it in Spanish okay the passion was there now but the subtitles seemed wrong.  Finally I got a friend from Spain to watch it for me and translated it. It was great. I just wished that they had enough money to get really good translators and voice actors. So 5 stars for the movie 4 stars for a bad sub and 3 stars for a bad dub.",1294358400,2,690,4.029197080291971
8404816,5,B003T04NE2,"i think this movie is as good or even better than the exorcist, one of the most interesting films i have seen.., really i did not expect a good movie when i rented it but i have to say that i was impressed..",1291420800,3,207,3.8372093023255816
8404817,3,B003T04NE2,"Better watch this movie in the original language , Spanish.  The dubbed versions available (English, portuguese) are articial ones.  This film is intriguing with a good explanation in the end. If you like a movie without blood or retarded American teens lost in camping site watch this one. You will enjoy ghosts, conspiracies of the church, the traditional haunted mansion and some mysteries revealed in the end.",1285372800,5,413,5.149253731343284
8404818,1,B003T04NE2,It was all I could do to stay awake in this weak boring dubbed film that sounds so bad I had to switch to the original Spanish language with subtitles. The Haunting is supposed to be a Ghost Story but fails in every aspect. Some of the worst acting I have ever seen and that says alot as I am a huge Horror fan. A Dr. and her Husband and newborn move into a house and hear things...Basically that is it. HORRIBLE!,1281225600,3,413,4.048780487804878
