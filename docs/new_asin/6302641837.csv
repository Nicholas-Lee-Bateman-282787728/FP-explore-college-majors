MGM's star transition from Buster to Jimmy continues, yet here Keaton holds his own as Timoleon Zanders Post, a lonely college professor who, wrongly believing he's inherited $750K, goes out into the world. Smitten by a talentless ingenue, Post invests in a crummy stageshow so he can take it to Broadway. Durante plays colorful entrepreneur/song-and-dance man 'Jimmy' Dodge, who at one jubilant point sings a few lines from his signature piece, ""Can Broadway Do Without Me?""

During NY rehearsals, the self-appointed starlet (Todd) of newly dubbed and tweaked musical revue ""Speak Easily"" invites Professor Post to her apartment for an intimate party. They get roaring drunk, she passes out and the gentlemanly Post manages to drag the woman to her bed. Then he disrobes, hangs his suit on an imaginary rack in the outside hall and collapses in the other bed.

Comes dawn and with it, two giant hangovers. Feigning anger, the actress questions what happened, blames innocent Post for getting her blotto and tells him to leave. While he gathers his things, she sneakily phones a friend (Brophy) and urges him to hurry right over and pretend to be her irate brother. When the ""brother"" suddenly arrives, suitless Post hides in the other room while Brophy bellows that this cad must marry his sister.

As he's carrying on, Jimmy climbs the fire escape and sends the dignified Post scurrying down it in his own flashy checkered duds. Then ol' banana nose bursts out of the bedroom half-dressed to cheerily announce that it'll be a sacrifice, but he'll marry the girl! It's a classic switcheroo that foils the scheme of golddigging Todd and Brophy.

Absolute chaos is heightened by a bill collector with an injuction who, when he corners Post, will demand an owed 10K or he'll close the show. At first he doesn't believe that clownish Keaton is the smash hit's owner and not its star; his payment demands are met when an investor with deep pockets buys half-interest in Speak Easily.

487204,3,6302641837,"Speak Easily, 1932 film

The film begins by showing ""Potts College"" founded 1876, it is co-educational. Professor Post returns, and the conversation is morbidly funny. A letter brings news of an inheritance, so Post leaves to travel by train. There is comic confusion on the train. We learn of the practical joke! At the station Post misses the train and visits the Opera House for a show. Post loans the show $250 to pay their debt. On Broadway they learn how they are rated. Miss Eleanor Espere walks in for her part. ""Oh Timmy!"" Hospitality in a Big City? ""I prefer cocoa."" Later Timmy has a few drinks at Eleanor's place. There is confusion afterwards. Post's lawyer shows up with news about the inheritance. Post must leave the state to prevent an attachment!

Jimmy Dodge comes to the rescue! The law wants to attach the property before the show begins. The show begins, the audience laughs at the mistakes. The actions are supposed to be funny. The confusion certainly is. It continues to the next act. The audience laughs. They think it is part of the show. A man offers a large sum for a half interest in the show. So there is a happy ending.

In addition to Buster Keaton and Jimmy Durante, you will see Thelma Todd and Hedda Hopper. Sidney Toler is the stage director (he later played ""Charlie Chan""). The background scenes tell about show business life in the 1930s.",1266883200,,1378,4.639344262295082
487205,2,6302641837,"Watching ""Speak Easily"" is painful for fans of Buster Keaton. Seeing such a phenomenal writer, actor, comic, director, and stunt man subjected to this humiliating spectacle is like seeing a Picasso used as a drop cloth, or perhaps more like seeing the finest camembert adulterated with whey solids and processed into Cheez-Whiz.

Keaton is ill-cast as Professor Post, whose overblown vocabulary is the only thing keeping him from saying, ""Tell me about the rabbits, George."" (Post would have said something like, ""Kindly inform me as to the status of the small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order Lagomorpha, kind sir, who I believe is primarily addressed with the epithet 'George'."") When Keaton created his own characters, they might be situationally clueless but they weren't stupid. They were quick studies and became masters of their worlds. Not so with Post, who never stops stumbling and bumbling and who who has no more control of his destiny than a bilge rat had of the Titanic. And while Keaton's
original characters had a charming naivete and innocence, Post comes across as such a profound sexual retardate that if he ever did become physically aroused, he'd put an ice bag on the swelling and seek medical help.

There are a couple of small redeeming moments, such as Keaton's attempts to get rid of the vampish Thema Todd or his suggestion as to appropriate attire for a Greek dance, but it's just not worth enduring the entire film to see them.

If you're a fan of bad movies, get drunk and watch ""Speak Easily"" with friends, a la ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"". But other than that, stick with the silents. Let them be 100% of what Buster Keaton is remembered for.",1252368000,,1689,4.857638888888889
487206,4,6302641837,"Everyone who loves Keaton agrees that he was a great comedian in the silent era and many of these also agree that he started to suffer from debasement of his performance as he stepped in to the era of talkies.

I had long been obsessed with this notion until I checked it out with my own eyes when I saw for the first time Keaton acting in his first talking feature entitled ""Free and Easy"".

My impression was contrary to many others's opinion that knock this film.
""How stunning!"" was my impression(I'd be grateful if you care to see my review for another Keaton DVD set containing his first talking feature for more details).

This "" Speak Easily"" was my second time to see Keaton acting as a talkie actor and it helped me underline my impression.

In this film, he plays a professor who looks naive but at times very opinionated.

I particularly love the movie's plot devising a fit of situations that make keaton act awkwardly thus consequently very hilarious.

Keaton's partner Jimmy Durante in this film is very outstanding but still modest to keep Keaton dominate the whole story.

The only disappointments are the omission of subtitles as always and the DVD is not technically made to jump to one's favourite parts or to skip the scenes you wish to fastfoward.",1223424000,,1269,4.638392857142857
487207,3,6302641837,"If you're a Keaton fan your eyeballs will not melt in their sockets if you watch this - it really is not bad. It would be a rather enjoyable early talkie if it were not for the fact that Buster Keaton's talents are being wasted in this film. Since I know that by this time (1932) MGM gave him no creative control and treated him just as a performer, I can only wonder what the film would have been like if someone had listened to his ideas. However, at least there are no moments in which you must look away in embarrassment at what MGM is doing to the man, as there are in Free and Easy.

The good:
a. Unlike Free and Easy (a real embarrassment of a film), Buster does get the girl in the end.
b. Buster shows a real penchant for dialogue and verbal comedy, demonstrating that he was not outside his element in talking pictures.
c. The seduction/morning after scenes with Buster and Thelma Todd. Todd gave the best supporting performance in the cast. What a shame she died so young.
d. The ending where Keaton disrupts the show but scores a hit with the audience. It's not the most clever stuff he ever did, but it is funny.

The bad:
a. Buster being made to play a straight man to Jimmy Durante.
b. Buster's expressive eyes being hidden behind his pince-nez spectacles.
c. Buster bungling into a happy ending. In his years as an independent filmmaker his character would often start out lost and fumbling around, but he figured things out in the end and came up with resourceful and deliberate solutions.

The ugly:
Why did this film need Buster Keaton anyway? Lots of comics less talented than Keaton could have been employed to recite the dialogue that was written for this script and take a few pratfalls. I'm sure in 1943 you could have dressed up Orson Welles in a gorilla suit and he would have been an effective and convincing gorilla in just about any film you put him in - but why on earth would you want to?

As far as video and audio quality, this film is in very good shape for being a public domain copy of a 75 year old film. There's no hissing in the audio and the video has no scratches in it and is quite clear.",1186531200,4,2130,4.304239401496259
487208,3,6302641837,"Keaton made worst movies that this for MGM - Free and Easy is the one that springs to my mind.  In saying that this is no masterpiece, far from it.

The storyline leads to what should be a funny movie and parts of this are, for instance the scene with Thelma Todd at the hotel room (BTW love that drinks cabinet) and the morning after. I also like the little bit at the beginning with the train. And I like the Theatre Scenes at the end of the movie.

But like nearly everyone here we all know what was to come after so we know that this is the beginning of the end for Keaton at MGM.  Durante and Keaton are not a good mix, Cliff Edwards and Keaton would have been much better combination.",1178496000,2,690,4.088888888888889
487209,3,6302641837,"Boy! Am I in the minority opinion here or what?

 I have often heard the complaints that when Buster started making sound pictures and signed with MGM his career was over. And I even believe Buster made remarks to that effect as well. But, I don't know, I don't mind Buster's sound pictures. Granted I have only seen a few of them, I think of them as light diversions. I also don't mind the films Laurel & Hardy made in the 40s.

 ""Speak Easily"" has Buster Keaton playing Professor Post, a lonely man who never gets a chance to go out and lead a social life. He has no friends, no love in his life and only his butler to tell his worries to. One day Buster finds out he has inherited 750,000. He sets off and plans to go out a live life. Do all the things he's always wanted to do.

 ""Speak Easily"" works best in the early moments and then struggles trying to find the correct tone. Maybe this is because Keaton and Durante had such different comedy styles.

 But I still don't think of this as a bad movie and wouldn't mind watching it again. It may not be as good as some of Buster's silent films such as ""Sherlock, Jr."", ""The General"", and ""Our Hospitality"".

 The movie was directed by Edward Sedgwick, who directed several of Keaton's later films starting with in order of preference; ""The Cameraman"", ""Spite Marriage"", ""Doughboys"", and ""The Passionate Plumber"" (Also with Durante), though I prefer ""Plumber"" over this movie.

 But ""Speak Easily"" has some good slapstick moments, particulary at the end of the film. I also liked a scene between Keaton and Thelma Todd, as an actress trying to get into Buster's good graces. And a gag dealing with a train in the beginning I found funny.

 I'm sorry, surprised, and slightly embarrassed to find I'm the only one who likes this movie, but contrary to what you've heard I'd recommend Keaton fans take a look at this one.

 Bottom-line: Enjoyable, light Keaton ""talkie"" that offers laughs but does have its problems. Has enough moments that made me laugh to suggest the movie to fans. Or maybe I'm a pushover for Keaton?",1090281600,19,2071,4.526881720430108
487210,4,6302641837,"Despite his personal troubles during the early 1930s, Buster Keaton reveals another dimension of his comic talent in ""Speak Easily."" He gives a splendid performance as Timolean Zanders Post, an isolated professor who believes he has inherited $750,000. With this mistaken financial security, he manages a struggling vaudeville troupe that he takes to Broadway. ""Speak Easily"" was the second MGM film to pair Keaton with Jimmy Durante. Though an unusual combination, they work remarkably well in this enjoyable musical-comedy  one of the few movies that displays Keaton's flair for verbal humor. The result is the best of Keaton's MGM talkies.",933552000,10,642,5.42
