3147404,4,B0015TQQY4,"You will not regret watching these series, they are everything the previous reviews describe and more - lush, rich, colorful background and gorgeous, talented actors. If you are looking for a complete presentation of Tolstoy novel, just pick up a book and read it, no movie will give you a pure, unsullied experience of Tolstoy's novel. But these series, ""inspired"" by the book, can give a clear introduction into the spirit of the novel and characters otherwise confusing in their numbers. I thought the film did justice to the gist of the matter - free spirited Natasha, morose and complex Andrey, naive and good hearted Pierre, cold and beautiful Helene etc. - my favorite by far in this film is Vassily Kuragin, it takes a real Italian to portrait a Russian villain so brilliantly!  They did get certain crucial points - prince Andrey's crisis during the first battle, Natasha's angst over his absence and seduction by Anatole, Kutuzov's hesitation at engaging in action with French, Pierre's touching declaration to Natasha - all those all too important moments drilled into us in Russian schools. What if few details in their costumes are wrong  or they dance waltz? in 1812? to the Masquerade Suite by Khachaturian. Just go with the flow and enjoy it!",1333152000,5,1258,4.929245283018868
3147405,1,B0015TQQY4,"I am a Tolstoy aficionado, have read War and Peace more than once.  I say this in order to qualify my review.  I have also seen all 4 of the major movie productions.

The first production with Audrey Hepburn was a US made piece and is sadly dated, also it is so short that everything is abbreviated.

The second production, by Bondarchuk, is a magnificent production, but I felt somewhat disappointed with it as to me Tolstoy balances the human and world events in such a profound way, and this production seems to focus mainly on the world events.  However, some of the battle scenes are like great symphonies and bring deep emotions and tears to the eyes.  There is little depth or development of the stories of the characters, however.  Platon Karatayev, for example, is barely mentioned and is a pivotal part of the story of Pierre.

My favorite production to this day is the one produced by the BBC with Anthony Hopkins as Pierre.  In this 12 hour series a number of very strong characters create an interwoven story which I have watched a number of times.  The characters of Pierre, Natasha, Andrei, Princess Maria, The old Prince Bolkonsky, Helene and all the others are so memorable that I would recommend this production as the greatest thus far produced.  Although they did not have the resources to produce the battle scenes, costumes and authentic sets, this is after all fiction.  And some of the greatest plays are done with virtually nothing but a few props.

It was with great anticipation that I purchased this most recent production directed by Dornhelm, touted at costing 30,000,000.00 and supposedly involved with the personalities of the book.

I was appalled to see that the actual story has been raped and pillaged to abbreviate events leading to the engagement with Andre.  I get the feeling that, typical of so many productions of the late 20th and early 21st century, that there was this big budget to be spent and huge resources to be managed, at the cost of a single artist putting together a cogent and cohesive work of art.  Although I felt some disappointment at the rather shallow depictions of the characters in the Bondarchuk production, I feel utter anger and contempt that the characters in this present one are so uninteresting and lacking in any depth.

To have a Natasha running around with a schoolgirl crush on Andre, when in the story she only vaguely sees him, not to show the very difficult relationship between the Countess Rostov and her ward Sonia from the beginning, and the reason Sonia is unwanted as a daughter in law, due to the profligacy of the Rostovs financial decisions, good hearted as they are, all make me angry that so much could be wasted on such an insipid production.

This production has been compared to the one of Napoleon, which I have also watched several times, and I can't see any comparison as in that the characters are all riveting, strong actors.  Even though it is involved with a lot of historical events and not even a novel, the characters themselves carry this magnificent production.

To me this latest production of War and Peace is like so much of what is wrong with the present era.  Everything is superficial, there is no time to get to deep emotion or profundity, it is all frippery, clothes hung on totally forgettable actors and actresses, and visions of a past whose real glory lives only through great works of literature and great art.

I do not recommend wasting any money on this movie.  Just read the book and check out the BBC production from your local library!",1284422400,106,3557,4.710823909531502
3147406,5,B0015TQQY4,"I could not help but watch the entire series in one sitting. I thought that it was beautifully done. During the first episode I fell in love with Prince Andrei, and during the second and third episode I was hating Countess Bezukov, her brother Prince Anatole and sometimes even Natasha, and during the last episode... no, I'm not going to tell you about the last episode, you have to see it for yourselves. Overall, I thought that acting was great, costumes and scenery were gorgeous, some scenes were especially beautiful and reminded me of paintings. I understand that some purists did not like this adaptation, but being somewhat a purist myself I still greatly enjoyed these series. Now I am going to read the book again, and I'm sure after that I'll watch this adaptation again.
p.s. the only complain would be the lack of English subtitles.",1284163200,7,846,4.761904761904762
3147407,1,B0015TQQY4,"Clearly this is made for popular viewing by people who have never read the book. It uses  some of the basic narrative of events and characters to make a costume soap opera. It has none of the poetry, none of the philosophical musings searching for wisdom, none of the variety of characters or understanding of humanity of Tolstoy's great literary masterpiece. Even Pierre has been turned into a socially easy, seductive image for someone's erotic fantasy, with glasses the only indicator of Tolstoy's intention that he be a socially awkward, rather plump, bumbling intellectual. It has taken his beautiful novel and turned it into trash. The movie made by the Russian Bondarchuk is wonderful but in Russian and my copy is a faded 30 year old tape. I was lured into buying this version by the enthusiastic  reviews above and hope this will alert others in my place.",1269993600,13,864,4.831081081081081
3147408,1,B0015TQQY4,"This has to be by far the worst film interpretation of War and Peace! THE WORST!  The plot is absurdly muddled. Prince Andrew does not meet Natasha at the beginning of the story at her name day celebration. He resided principally in ST Petersburg and the Rostovs are Moscovite nobility. Natasha did not long and pine for Prince Andrei while he was married to Lise. She only meets him when he comes to Otradnoye to conduct business with her father after becoming a widower. At the grand ball, the music is completely inaccurate and by Khachaturian - composed a century later. And the decor is 90% wrong throughout the film and mostly of styles that existed 50 to 70 yrs later -in short ghastly Victorian hideous monstrosities. The Rostovs, Bezhukovs, Kuragins and Bolkonsky family would have lived in delightful late 18th Century Louis XVI interiors and at the most modish Prince Andrei and Lise would have lived in a Consulat style house as a stylish young menage. Anna Dimitrievna's part is way blown out of proportion and she appears far more in the film and seems to play a much more imposing presence in the film than Tolstoy intended. Then that absurd scene where the Tsar sends Count Rostov (who was hardly in the inner circle at the Imperial Court!) a message about the outbreak of war in 1805 as the Rostovs are celebrating Natasha's name day, is totally delusional and never occurred in Tolstoy's novel. Neither did Countess Helene Bezhukov have any desire to exact any revenge on Natasha. This is another totally delusional moment in the film and totally NOT in the novel.  And this laundry list of inaccuracies is just the tip of the iceberg. This film has taken a fascinating story which I have loved since reading it 37 yrs ago at age 13 - and have reread many times since- and made it B-O-R-I-N-G! Pierre is also all wrong too. In Tolstoy's novel, he is clearly Fat and ungainly.

As far as film interpretations go, none is perfect. The 1956 version with Audrey Hepburn is also full of shortcuts and inaccuracies but has more desire to adhere to Tolstoy's narrative and Audrey Hepburn is worth watching as is Mel Ferrer and some of the supporting cast interpretations of characters. In the end, it's also a fun - if rather cheesy 1950's fluffy costume historical film and has a amusing mid century cinema element to it. The BBC version for TV in the early 1970's is excellent - albeit dated.  And it does not escape the characteristic - if endearing ""Britishisms"" of such productions regardless if the story transpires in Russia or France. It's still worth watching. In the end, Sergei Bondarchuk's  version is probably the best. Although it is also dated and the decor has some inexcusable inaccuracies in light of the fact that Mosfilm and Bondarchuk had enviable resources at their disposal to recreate early 19th Century aristocratic interiors. Admittedly, Bondarchuk's film is hard to follow if the viewer has not read the book. So read the book and get with the programme! But don't waste you money on this DVD!",1269648000,26,3031,4.743833017077799
3147409,5,B0015TQQY4,"Condensed classic of epic proportions and sensual sensory splendors!  This Italian T.V. mini series is studded with an international cast of brilliant players and enough extras to fill the Cinecitta Rome set five times over. One of the fascinating things about this marvelously accessible version of the story is that it (for us in the USA) is in English. Don't let the Russian Box fool you. An extra added bonus it that the film was shot in Russia so you get the added pleasure of seeing some incredible architecture of the period and the stunning Russian countryside (And a little of Lithuania.)

  There is in the huge cast some real stand out performances. Brenda Blethyn is wonderful as always, and as Prince Andre's father Malcolm McDowell is chilling and arresting in his approach to the part.

  In the lead female role we have the lovely Cemence Posey, who is near perfect in a role so associated in the West with Audrey Hepburn. There have been complaints that she is a blond in a traditionally dark haired part, but that seems trivial to me in comparison to her performance. In the romantic lead of Prince Andre is the wonderful Italian star, Alessio Boni. He brings to the role a deliciously tragic gravitas that is so important to the story. He is a brilliant actor who needs more exposure on this side of the world. Just check out his work in ""The Best Of Youth"" and ""Don't Tell"".

 Also the incredibly beautiful Violante Placido plays the wicked Helene with relish and great style. Not since Polly Walker in HBO's Rome has there been such a delicious wicked woman on the screen. She was a delight to watch and I found myself missing her when she was not on screen.

  Benjamin Sadler (Who was so brilliant in ""Augustus"" see my amazon review of that film) is on hand to lend his considerable snakey charm and great presence to the role of Dolokov. (Why is this actor not a huge star yet?)

  Yes there are many other worthy performances to see and savor in this lush and enthralling film, too many to go any further with here. Rather, take the chance and get this film and let the magic of Tolstoy's timeless story take you into a world that is gone with the wind.

  Yes it is not as huge and epic as the 1968 Russian classic but it is none the less even at times more wonderful!

The DVD is splendid with clear beautiful image and great sound. As I said the film is in Enlish with an international cast. It is obvious they are all speaking in English and if any are dubbed that is Not obvious. Very well done in the sound department. And the score by Jan A.P. Kaczmarek is lush and soaring. Most particularly stunning at the end of act two as Natasha descends the grand staircase with the viper Anitole Kuragin (Ken Dunken) on her heals.",1246924800,23,2753,4.491967871485944

3147420,5,B0015TQQY4,"This series is a lovely version of the book. No, its not the 23 episode BBC version from the 70's that starred Anthony Hopkins, and its not verbatim Tolstoy, but that would be impossible to accomplish in 7 hours.

For a relatively recent production, the screen play was very good and, aside from a few dramatic exceptions, it stayed within highlights and major events of War and Peace itself. The acting was great, the costumes,sets, and music were all lush.  Aside from Malcom McDowell (who was superb as the nasty old Prince at his lathe), the cast consisted of unknowns. I hope this effort did something for their careers.

3147425,4,B0015TQQY4,"I always love to see my favorite novels on the screen, and this interpretation is honest, well done, though not perfect.
I thought the combinination of Marya Dmetrievna and Anna Mikhailovna into one strong female character was well done, and superbly portrayed.  However, dropping Boris Drubetskoy from the story altogether and making Natasha have an instant ""love at first sight"" for Prince Andrei was disappointing, and frankly, made for a ridiculous beginning.  The film improved from there, though.
The acting was superb. Really. I will watch this again and again not for the script, but for the performances.  The overemphasized romantic scenes are too drawn-out, but not so much that it is uncomfortable.  I just wish some of the other plot points had been brought out a little more.
There is one short scene that is inappropriate for children (Helene staying behind with the French in Moscow) and plenty of non-gory yet mostly realistic war scenes. Just fyi for parents.
All in all, a good effort that I am glad to own.",1433548800,5,1026,4.9476744186046515

3147427,5,B0015TQQY4,"Any film of War & Peace can only be like a Classics Illustrated Comics version of such a great book.  I found this version very appealing for several reasons.  1)  It was an all-Europe production of one of Europe's great masterpieces.  It was like Europe looking at and celebrating itself and its culture with its best actors, locations and production values.  2)  The cast seemed to be enjoying themselves while making this.  3) The costumes and sets were beautiful.  You felt you were seeing something pretty close to what these times must have been like.  4)  The music was lush and evocative, both the real period pieces and the themes composed for the film.  5)  I could actually follow who was who in the huge cast and navigate the many interwoven story threads of this great novel.  6)  It's hard to define, but you can tell when a production ""comes together"" with its sets, costumes, actors and writing.  This version of War & Peace did that for me.  I simply felt very satisfied with it.  For comparison, I love the 1950s American-Italian film by King Vidor as an old friend from Saturday afternoon TV matinees.  I respect the 1960s Soviet Bondarchuk version with its awesome battle scenes, while I think the 1970s PBS version is dreadful because they didn't even try with the battles.",1430092800,2,1294,4.700892857142857
3147428,5,B0015TQQY4,"Anyone who loves the knowledge of Almighty God's Providence in establishing and nurturing a Sanctified People can appreciate that Russian history has included many who pleased our Creator and Father and King. The fall of Tsarist Russia can be understood clearly by many of the behaviors chronicled in Tolstoy's classic story; debauchery and dysfunctional irreligiosity in the intelligentsia was a favorite theme of 19th century Russian literature. But there is something far more important than the tails side of the coin . . . on the upside a few of us are moved so deeply by the beauty of a society where an ecclesiastical knowledge of God is a dominant force among millions of people. The distinctive of Russian heritage is so profoundly revealed by characters in War and Peace whose maturation, dignity and sense of nobility is illustrated in a beauty that leaves one awestruck. This film starring Poesy and Boni and Beyer is a collage of thousands of beautiful, beautiful portraits with music of the St. Petersburg Symphony Orchestra, with much of the presentation filmed on location in Russia. This 2007 presentation is a glimpse of the splendor of a future that will be the way of life for Russia's resurrected and restored saints (Revelation 7:9), and for so many others who will join them. This is a MUST SEE film for all who understand the Monarchy of God as King of this Universe, and for all who empathize deeply with a planet tormented by the failings of weak and sinful people.

3147432,5,B0015TQQY4,"The Best Adaptation of Tolstoys Novel
 Widely considered to be the finest novel ever written, Leo Tolstoys War and Peace is so long and contains so many characters and events that adapting it to film and at the same time retaining the essence of the numerous storylines must be a daunting task.  Attempts to film it go back to the silent era with a 1915 Russian version.  In 1956 Hollywood came out with a 3  hour epic, directed by King Vidor and starring Henry Fonda, Audrey Hepburn, and Mel Ferrer.  In 1968 the Soviet government financed an expensive and much-acclaimed epic of its own, and in 1972 the BBC put forth a 12 hour mini-series that starred Anthony Hopkins.  But this 2007 European production, 8 hours in length, is the best of the lot, exciting, entertaining, and capturing the spirit of Tolstoys enormous drama by focusing on the three main charactersPierre Bezukhov, Natasha Rostov, and Andrei Bolkonsky, their families, and the people in their various orbits, as they live their lives amidst the historical upheavals taking place in the world around them.
 Like the novel, the series is divided into four parts, and covers the years 18051812, when Napoleon Bonaparte was rampaging about Europe, overturning the old order and replacing it with one of his own creation.  Like another conqueror 130 years later, Napoleon, unable to get his army across the English Channel, decided to turn his guns east, and War and Peace culminates with his invasion of Russia:  We see the Battle of Borodino, the capture and burning of Moscow, the agonizing retreat of the French Army from the city and the Russians final victory over the French as they drive them back across the Niemen River.
 The characters are pushed and pulled by this historical tumult:  Pierre begins as an admirer of Napoleon, then, as he witnesses the horrors of war, becomes determined to assassinate the man he once held in such high esteem.  Andrei, unhappy with the life he is leading as a young aristocrat with a wife and a child on the way, sets out for war hoping to find glory on the battlefield, and, when wounded at the Battle of Austerlitz, comes home just in time to witness his wife dying in childbirth.  Natasha, seeking love, becomes engaged to Andrei in the wake of his wifes death, but in his absence is seduced by Pierres brother in law, the rakish Anatole Kuragin.
 German actor Alexander Beyer is excellent as Pierre, far better than Henry Fonda in the 1956 version.  Fonda was too American and too old to convincingly portray a young Russian nobleman, but Beyer conveys Pierre perfectly as he progresses from an illegitimate son to a wealthy young heir, nave and idealistic, marrying the gorgeous Helene Kuragin (who would not ever deign to notice him before he inherited his fathers fortune) and gradually beginning to realize he has been used and then made a fool of by his wife and her unscrupulous family.
 Natasha is played by French actress Clemence Poesya high-spirited teenage girl who loves life but is unaware of the pitfalls it has to offer.  Italian actor Alessio Boni is Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, a brooding, unhappy man who blames himself for his wifes death and hopes to find happiness with Natasha.  But while he is away at the Polish border, strengthening Russias defenses against another attack by Napoleon, she falls under the spell of Anatole Kuragin and breaks her engagement with Andrei, and learns when it is too late that Kuragins intentions were less than honorable.
 These personal dramas are overtaken by historical events.  When Napoleon invades Russia in 1812, the characters are in the path of his juggernaut.  Andrei is wounded again, this time fatally, at the Battle of Borodino, but manages to live long enough to forgive Natasha and say goodbye to her.  As Napoleons army approaches Moscow the Rostovs have to flee the city, and when they are safely away they see that Moscow is on fire.  Pierre, who witnessed the battle, lies in wait in the burning city, hoping to kill Napoleon but is taken prisoner instead.  When the French abandon Moscow he is forced to go along, suffering from starvation and cold, eventually freed from captivity by a force commanded by his old rival, Dolokhov, whom he suspected of being his wifes lover.
 This is a fine version of War and Peace.  My only complaint is that it isn't longer; I would have enjoyed it if more had been done with Napoleons epic retreat from Moscow (here the 1956 version really stood out).  German actor Ken Duken is especially good as the womanizing Anatole, and another German, Benjamin Sadler, is equally fine as the roguish Dolokhov.  Britisher Malcolm McDowell does his expected best as the elder Prince Bolkonsky.
 No movie or mini-series could ever do justice to War and Peace; there is simply too much to itnovel, history, philosophy, all rolled into one massive volume.  But for entertainment value and a faithful rendition of the basic story of War and Peace, this is one not to be missed.",1416096000,7,4984,4.82256169212691
3147433,2,B0015TQQY4,I am not sure what to really say except that it is beautiful in the settings and costumes. I think they attempted to fill in the behind-the-scenes parts that I don't recall being a part of the original book or any of the adaptations that I've seen. I believe they tried to make it their own original adaptation. but the intricacy of such characters not fulfilling their normal roles as in the book this movie really did not make a lot of sense. The acting was really only worth 2 stars but I gave it a total of 3 stars due to the effort and the beauty of the settings and costumes. if you really wants to see the best adaptation of we are told stories war and peace I recommend the 1970s version with Anthony Hopkins.,1414195200,2,717,4.240875912408759

3147439,1,B0015TQQY4,"Having seen the first three adaptations of War and Peace, I thought I was in for treat with this latest effort.  Verdict: Do NOT, I repeat NOT buy this wretched effort.  I never finished episode 2, because it was so insufferably boring.  The novel has been reduced to a badly written telenovela, and boring badly written soap opera at that.  This great sweeping epic of Russian history has been reduced to tripe.  The costumes are not bad.  The exterior shots not bad.  But for the love of God, they put Pierre's house at Peterhof, an imperial residence!!!! The battle scenes are an awful terrible joke.  There is neither a feel for Imperial Russia, nor a sincere attempt to understand it.  Compare the visit of the Black Madonna at the Battle of Borodino in the Soviet version demonstrating the enormous faith and piety of all classes, (tears in their eyes, repeatedly crossing themselves, deep bass voices, the Field Marshall kneeling) with the pale, cheap, and half-hearted attempt in this sorry sorry production.  No feeling for the Russian soul.  Please,  do not get me started about the whole revisions of personalities and conflicts.  Do NOT buy this POS!!!!",1388275200,8,1165,4.88265306122449
3147440,1,B0015TQQY4,"This is not Tolstoy's War & Peace. In the great Russian writer's epic the characters are all individualized (even some animals!). Here the characters do not resemble Tolstoy's creations; they are neither individualized nor do they develop. In Tolstoy's epic the leading character, Pierre Bezuhov, begins as a confused young man, tries various life styles (drinking, reform of his peasants, free masonry) to find the meaning of life, but in this movie he is simply a blockhead throughout. Natasha, the leading female character is not the vibrant high spirited young girl who develops into a real woman, but a more brooding foolish girl. None of the lesser characters are like their counterparts in the novel. Tolstoy was a great writer who makes the reader feel that this is what life is all about, the day to day living of it and loving all things. This movie does not retain the real characters nor the sense of history of the novel. Above all, Tolstoy's novel is about Russia. There is little of Russia in this movie.
  The best version of War and Peace is the BBC's version starring Anthony Hopkins. This is true to the book and uses the plot and dialogue of the original.",1388102400,15,1175,4.754901960784314

This rendition is my favorite because: (1) It was produced as a mini-series for television and as a result did not have to have ""cuts""
of portions of the storyline as Tolstoy wrote it.
(2) The acting was very good and they brought to life the emotions and portrayed the experiences as Tolstoy wrote them despite the fact that the cast did not include any big name celebrity movie or TV  stars.  The members of this cast deserve accolades for their performances.
And finally (3) I found the cinematography and sound to be of excellent quality.

This 2007 adaptation has better overall casting than the '56, '67, or '72 productions. Filming on location in Russia also helps. The Rostov family, Price Andrei, Old Bolkonsky, Helene, Dolokhov, and others are well-realized and well-acted (albeit dubbed into a rather stale English). Pierre is a quite bit leaner than Tolstoy's creation, but appropriately awkward, and a big improvement over the pretty-boy Fonda in '56 or the aging Bondarchuk in '67. As for Natasha, I got over her portrayal as a blonde pretty quickly, and thought Poesy does a serviceable job channeling the young Rostova's Manic-Pixie-Dream-Girl qualities.

The ""War"" scenes are duly enhanced by cgi, but are clearly not the main reason to see this version. The series fares better with the far more budget-friendly ""Peace"" portion of the Novel. Some of the sequences are remarkably faithful (most of the Bolknosky family narrative, for example), but many others were altered for dramatic effect, or to suit modern audiences:

3147447,5,B0015TQQY4,"This effort keeps the spirit and message of Tolstoy intact. He would have approved.
Every film/theater adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's ""War and Peace"" has naysayers. A novel (originally published in 1869 with 1200+ pages) of this length requires adjustment.
Step aside Anna Karenina and make room for ""War & Peace."" It's just as film-worthy.

This is an elegant look at the high social life of Russia with exquisite period costuming as good as any previously created for epic TV drama. Sensational symphony orchestration. A combo dazzling to the eye & ear. This 2007 version has a great international cast. Amazingly it is nearly impossible to recognize at least 9 of the actors were dubbed in English. It's so well done; it is obvious the actors HAD to be speaking English during the filming. After watching over 7 hours of this adapted drama, you'll wish for more. Alas, Tolstoy wrote no sequel.

The story remains true to the Tolstoy plot and reveals the character of members of 4 Russian society aristocratic families: Bolkonsky, Rostov, Bezukhov, & Kuragin with a bit added time to Boris Drubetsky. Family relationships drive the plot of interaction between socialites in the Napoleonic invasion period, including romances. Much of the Tolstoy philosophical discussion that makes the book so fantastic is left in the book, but not all.

SUBTITLES provided. Unrated but with obvious war violence. This European version refrains from massive gore and blood slinging that seems today to be a must to sell American films.
1-- 1805. Natasha (Clemence Poesy) eyes married Prince Andrej (Alessio Boni) who has personal visions of being a hero of fighting men. His friend Pierre (Alexander Beyer) inherits while the country prepares for war against the Napoleon threat. 4 family paths begin to cross. Andrej's father played by Malcolm McDowell, and you'll love to hate him. Aging socialite Marja Dmitrijewna Achrosimowa played by Brenda Blethyn (`Vera').

2-- 1811-12. Count Pierre is yet struggling with responsibilities and marriage. There is war-fighting danger to face for the soldiers of the 4 families. Greed, power, and revenge weight heavily; as do romances amid families.

3-- Nuptial rumor instigates renewed sabotage attempts on individual's charateer and status. Napoleon's wicked tactics of battle encourages Pierre's inclusion at the Battle of Borodino, Sep 7, 1812.

4-- 1813. Residents of Moscow run ahead of Napoleon's advances. Natasha, Marja Bolkonsky (Valentina Cervi), & Pierre all make decisions based on the unfurling tumult. Who will die; who will live on to love?

But these series, ""inspired"" by the book, can give a clear introduction into the spirit of the novel and characters otherwise confusing in their numbers. I thought the film did justice to the gist of the matter - free spirited Natasha, morose and complex Andrey, naive and good hearted Pierre, cold and beautiful Helene etc. - my favorite by far in this film is Vassily Kuragin, it takes a real Italian to portrait a Russian villain so brilliantly!  They did get certain crucial points - prince Andrey's crisis during the first battle, Natasha's angst over his absence and seduction by Anatole, Kutuzov's hesitation at engaging in action with French, Pierre's touching declaration to Natasha - all those all too important moments drilled into us in Russian schools.

3381902,1,B0015TQQY4,"I am a Tolstoy aficionado, have read War and Peace more than once.  I say this in order to qualify my review.  I have also seen all 4 of the major movie productions.

The first production with Audrey Hepburn was a US made piece and is sadly dated, also it is so short that everything is abbreviated.

The second production, by Bondarchuk, is a magnificent production, but I felt somewhat disappointed with it as to me Tolstoy balances the human and world events in such a profound way, and this production seems to focus mainly on the world events.  However, some of the battle scenes are like great symphonies and bring deep emotions and tears to the eyes.  There is little depth or development of the stories of the characters, however.  Platon Karatayev, for example, is barely mentioned and is a pivotal part of the story of Pierre.

My favorite production to this day is the one produced by the BBC with Anthony Hopkins as Pierre.  In this 12 hour series a number of very strong characters create an interwoven story which I have watched a number of times.  The characters of Pierre, Natasha, Andrei, Princess Maria, The old Prince Bolkonsky, Helene and all the others are so memorable that I would recommend this production as the greatest thus far produced.  Although they did not have the resources to produce the battle scenes, costumes and authentic sets, this is after all fiction.  And some of the greatest plays are done with virtually nothing but a few props.

It was with great anticipation that I purchased this most recent production directed by Dornhelm, touted at costing 30,000,000.00 and supposedly involved with the personalities of the book.

I was appalled to see that the actual story has been raped and pillaged to abbreviate events leading to the engagement with Andre.  I get the feeling that, typical of so many productions of the late 20th and early 21st century, that there was this big budget to be spent and huge resources to be managed, at the cost of a single artist putting together a cogent and cohesive work of art.  Although I felt some disappointment at the rather shallow depictions of the characters in the Bondarchuk production, I feel utter anger and contempt that the characters in this present one are so uninteresting and lacking in any depth.

To have a Natasha running around with a schoolgirl crush on Andre, when in the story she only vaguely sees him, not to show the very difficult relationship between the Countess Rostov and her ward Sonia from the beginning, and the reason Sonia is unwanted as a daughter in law, due to the profligacy of the Rostovs financial decisions, good hearted as they are, all make me angry that so much could be wasted on such an insipid production.

This production has been compared to the one of Napoleon, which I have also watched several times, and I can't see any comparison as in that the characters are all riveting, strong actors.  Even though it is involved with a lot of historical events and not even a novel, the characters themselves carry this magnificent production.

To me this latest production of War and Peace is like so much of what is wrong with the present era.  Everything is superficial, there is no time to get to deep emotion or profundity, it is all frippery, clothes hung on totally forgettable actors and actresses, and visions of a past whose real glory lives only through great works of literature and great art.

I do not recommend wasting any money on this movie.  Just read the book and check out the BBC production from your local library!",1284422400,106,3557,4.710823909531502

Overall, I thought that acting was great, costumes and scenery were gorgeous, some scenes were especially beautiful and reminded me of paintings. I understand that some purists did not like this adaptation, but being somewhat a purist myself I still greatly enjoyed these series. Now I am going to read the book again, and I'm sure after that I'll watch this adaptation again.

It has none of the poetry, none of the philosophical musings searching for wisdom, none of the variety of characters or understanding of humanity of Tolstoy's great literary masterpiece. Even Pierre has been turned into a socially easy, seductive image for someone's erotic fantasy, with glasses the only indicator of Tolstoy's intention that he be a socially awkward, rather plump, bumbling intellectual. It has taken his beautiful novel and turned it into trash. The movie made by the Russian Bondarchuk is wonderful but in Russian and my copy is a faded 30 year old tape. I was lured into buying this version by the enthusiastic  reviews above and hope this will alert others in my place.",1269993600,13,864,4.831081081081081
3381905,1,B0015TQQY4,"This has to be by far the worst film interpretation of War and Peace! THE WORST!  The plot is absurdly muddled. Prince Andrew does not meet Natasha at the beginning of the story at her name day celebration. He resided principally in ST Petersburg and the Rostovs are Moscovite nobility. Natasha did not long and pine for Prince Andrei while he was married to Lise. She only meets him when he comes to Otradnoye to conduct business with her father after becoming a widower. At the grand ball, the music is completely inaccurate and by Khachaturian - composed a century later. And the decor is 90% wrong throughout the film and mostly of styles that existed 50 to 70 yrs later -in short ghastly Victorian hideous monstrosities. The Rostovs, Bezhukovs, Kuragins and Bolkonsky family would have lived in delightful late 18th Century Louis XVI interiors and at the most modish Prince Andrei and Lise would have lived in a Consulat style house as a stylish young menage. Anna Dimitrievna's part is way blown out of proportion and she appears far more in the film and seems to play a much more imposing presence in the film than Tolstoy intended. Then that absurd scene where the Tsar sends Count Rostov (who was hardly in the inner circle at the Imperial Court!) a message about the outbreak of war in 1805 as the Rostovs are celebrating Natasha's name day, is totally delusional and never occurred in Tolstoy's novel. Neither did Countess Helene Bezhukov have any desire to exact any revenge on Natasha. This is another totally delusional moment in the film and totally NOT in the novel.  And this laundry list of inaccuracies is just the tip of the iceberg. This film has taken a fascinating story which I have loved since reading it 37 yrs ago at age 13 - and have reread many times since- and made it B-O-R-I-N-G! Pierre is also all wrong too. In Tolstoy's novel, he is clearly Fat and ungainly.

As far as film interpretations go, none is perfect. The 1956 version with Audrey Hepburn is also full of shortcuts and inaccuracies but has more desire to adhere to Tolstoy's narrative and Audrey Hepburn is worth watching as is Mel Ferrer and some of the supporting cast interpretations of characters. In the end, it's also a fun - if rather cheesy 1950's fluffy costume historical film and has a amusing mid century cinema element to it. The BBC version for TV in the early 1970's is excellent - albeit dated.  And it does not escape the characteristic - if endearing ""Britishisms"" of such productions regardless if the story transpires in Russia or France. It's still worth watching. In the end, Sergei Bondarchuk's  version is probably the best. Although it is also dated and the decor has some inexcusable inaccuracies in light of the fact that Mosfilm and Bondarchuk had enviable resources at their disposal to recreate early 19th Century aristocratic interiors. Admittedly, Bondarchuk's film is hard to follow if the viewer has not read the book. So read the book and get with the programme! But don't waste you money on this DVD!",1269648000,26,3031,4.743833017077799
3381906,5,B0015TQQY4,"Condensed classic of epic proportions and sensual sensory splendors!  This Italian T.V. mini series is studded with an international cast of brilliant players and enough extras to fill the Cinecitta Rome set five times over. One of the fascinating things about this marvelously accessible version of the story is that it (for us in the USA) is in English. Don't let the Russian Box fool you. An extra added bonus it that the film was shot in Russia so you get the added pleasure of seeing some incredible architecture of the period and the stunning Russian countryside (And a little of Lithuania.)

  There is in the huge cast some real stand out performances. Brenda Blethyn is wonderful as always, and as Prince Andre's father Malcolm McDowell is chilling and arresting in his approach to the part.

  In the lead female role we have the lovely Cemence Posey, who is near perfect in a role so associated in the West with Audrey Hepburn. There have been complaints that she is a blond in a traditionally dark haired part, but that seems trivial to me in comparison to her performance. In the romantic lead of Prince Andre is the wonderful Italian star, Alessio Boni. He brings to the role a deliciously tragic gravitas that is so important to the story. He is a brilliant actor who needs more exposure on this side of the world. Just check out his work in ""The Best Of Youth"" and ""Don't Tell"".

 Also the incredibly beautiful Violante Placido plays the wicked Helene with relish and great style. Not since Polly Walker in HBO's Rome has there been such a delicious wicked woman on the screen. She was a delight to watch and I found myself missing her when she was not on screen.

  Benjamin Sadler (Who was so brilliant in ""Augustus"" see my amazon review of that film) is on hand to lend his considerable snakey charm and great presence to the role of Dolokov. (Why is this actor not a huge star yet?)

  Yes there are many other worthy performances to see and savor in this lush and enthralling film, too many to go any further with here. Rather, take the chance and get this film and let the magic of Tolstoy's timeless story take you into a world that is gone with the wind.

  Yes it is not as huge and epic as the 1968 Russian classic but it is none the less even at times more wonderful!

The DVD is splendid with clear beautiful image and great sound. As I said the film is in Enlish with an international cast. It is obvious they are all speaking in English and if any are dubbed that is Not obvious. Very well done in the sound department. And the score by Jan A.P. Kaczmarek is lush and soaring.

However, dropping Boris Drubetskoy from the story altogether and making Natasha have an instant ""love at first sight"" for Prince Andrei was disappointing, and frankly, made for a ridiculous beginning.  The film improved from there, though.
The acting was superb. Really. I will watch this again and again not for the script, but for the performances.  The overemphasized romantic scenes are too drawn-out, but not so much that it is uncomfortable.  I just wish some of the other plot points had been brought out a little more.

For comparison, I love the 1950s American-Italian film by King Vidor as an old friend from Saturday afternoon TV matinees.

3381925,5,B0015TQQY4,"Anyone who loves the knowledge of Almighty God's Providence in establishing and nurturing a Sanctified People can appreciate that Russian history has included many who pleased our Creator and Father and King. The fall of Tsarist Russia can be understood clearly by many of the behaviors chronicled in Tolstoy's classic story; debauchery and dysfunctional irreligiosity in the intelligentsia was a favorite theme of 19th century Russian literature. But there is something far more important than the tails side of the coin . . . on the upside a few of us are moved so deeply by the beauty of a society where an ecclesiastical knowledge of God is a dominant force among millions of people. The distinctive of Russian heritage is so profoundly revealed by characters in War and Peace whose maturation, dignity and sense of nobility is illustrated in a beauty that leaves one awestruck. This film starring Poesy and Boni and Beyer is a collage of thousands of beautiful, beautiful portraits with music of the St. Petersburg Symphony Orchestra, with much of the presentation filmed on location in Russia. This 2007 presentation is a glimpse of the splendor of a future that will be the way of life for Russia's resurrected and restored saints (Revelation 7:9), and for so many others who will join them. This is a MUST SEE film for all who understand the Monarchy of God as King of this Universe, and for all who empathize deeply with a planet tormented by the failings of weak and sinful people.

3381929,5,B0015TQQY4,"The Best Adaptation of Tolstoys Novel
 Widely considered to be the finest novel ever written, Leo Tolstoys War and Peace is so long and contains so many characters and events that adapting it to film and at the same time retaining the essence of the numerous storylines must be a daunting task.  Attempts to film it go back to the silent era with a 1915 Russian version.  In 1956 Hollywood came out with a 3  hour epic, directed by King Vidor and starring Henry Fonda, Audrey Hepburn, and Mel Ferrer.  In 1968 the Soviet government financed an expensive and much-acclaimed epic of its own, and in 1972 the BBC put forth a 12 hour mini-series that starred Anthony Hopkins.  But this 2007 European production, 8 hours in length, is the best of the lot, exciting, entertaining, and capturing the spirit of Tolstoys enormous drama by focusing on the three main charactersPierre Bezukhov, Natasha Rostov, and Andrei Bolkonsky, their families, and the people in their various orbits, as they live their lives amidst the historical upheavals taking place in the world around them.
 Like the novel, the series is divided into four parts, and covers the years 18051812, when Napoleon Bonaparte was rampaging about Europe, overturning the old order and replacing it with one of his own creation.  Like another conqueror 130 years later, Napoleon, unable to get his army across the English Channel, decided to turn his guns east, and War and Peace culminates with his invasion of Russia:  We see the Battle of Borodino, the capture and burning of Moscow, the agonizing retreat of the French Army from the city and the Russians final victory over the French as they drive them back across the Niemen River.
 The characters are pushed and pulled by this historical tumult:  Pierre begins as an admirer of Napoleon, then, as he witnesses the horrors of war, becomes determined to assassinate the man he once held in such high esteem.  Andrei, unhappy with the life he is leading as a young aristocrat with a wife and a child on the way, sets out for war hoping to find glory on the battlefield, and, when wounded at the Battle of Austerlitz, comes home just in time to witness his wife dying in childbirth.  Natasha, seeking love, becomes engaged to Andrei in the wake of his wifes death, but in his absence is seduced by Pierres brother in law, the rakish Anatole Kuragin.
 German actor Alexander Beyer is excellent as Pierre, far better than Henry Fonda in the 1956 version.  Fonda was too American and too old to convincingly portray a young Russian nobleman, but Beyer conveys Pierre perfectly as he progresses from an illegitimate son to a wealthy young heir, nave and idealistic, marrying the gorgeous Helene Kuragin (who would not ever deign to notice him before he inherited his fathers fortune) and gradually beginning to realize he has been used and then made a fool of by his wife and her unscrupulous family.
 Natasha is played by French actress Clemence Poesya high-spirited teenage girl who loves life but is unaware of the pitfalls it has to offer.  Italian actor Alessio Boni is Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, a brooding, unhappy man who blames himself for his wifes death and hopes to find happiness with Natasha.  But while he is away at the Polish border, strengthening Russias defenses against another attack by Napoleon, she falls under the spell of Anatole Kuragin and breaks her engagement with Andrei, and learns when it is too late that Kuragins intentions were less than honorable.
 These personal dramas are overtaken by historical events.  When Napoleon invades Russia in 1812, the characters are in the path of his juggernaut.  Andrei is wounded again, this time fatally, at the Battle of Borodino, but manages to live long enough to forgive Natasha and say goodbye to her.  As Napoleons army approaches Moscow the Rostovs have to flee the city, and when they are safely away they see that Moscow is on fire.  Pierre, who witnessed the battle, lies in wait in the burning city, hoping to kill Napoleon but is taken prisoner instead.  When the French abandon Moscow he is forced to go along, suffering from starvation and cold, eventually freed from captivity by a force commanded by his old rival, Dolokhov, whom he suspected of being his wifes lover.
 This is a fine version of War and Peace.  My only complaint is that it isn't longer; I would have enjoyed it if more had been done with Napoleons epic retreat from Moscow (here the 1956 version really stood out).  German actor Ken Duken is especially good as the womanizing Anatole, and another German, Benjamin Sadler, is equally fine as the roguish Dolokhov.  Britisher Malcolm McDowell does his expected best as the elder Prince Bolkonsky.
 No movie or mini-series could ever do justice to War and Peace; there is simply too much to itnovel, history, philosophy, all rolled into one massive volume.  But for entertainment value and a faithful rendition of the basic story of War and Peace, this is one not to be missed.",1416096000,7,4984,4.82256169212691
3381930,2,B0015TQQY4,I am not sure what to really say except that it is beautiful in the settings and costumes. I think they attempted to fill in the behind-the-scenes parts that I don't recall being a part of the original book or any of the adaptations that I've seen. I believe they tried to make it their own original adaptation. but the intricacy of such characters not fulfilling their normal roles as in the book this movie really did not make a lot of sense. The acting was really only worth 2 stars but I gave it a total of 3 stars due to the effort and the beauty of the settings and costumes. if you really wants to see the best adaptation of we are told stories war and peace I recommend the 1970s version with Anthony Hopkins.,1414195200,2,717,4.240875912408759

I never finished episode 2, because it was so insufferably boring.  The novel has been reduced to a badly written telenovela, and boring badly written soap opera at that.  This great sweeping epic of Russian history has been reduced to tripe.  The costumes are not bad.  The exterior shots not bad.  But for the love of God, they put Pierre's house at Peterhof, an imperial residence!!!! The battle scenes are an awful terrible joke.  There is neither a feel for Imperial Russia, nor a sincere attempt to understand it.  Compare the visit of the Black Madonna at the Battle of Borodino in the Soviet version demonstrating the enormous faith and piety of all classes, (tears in their eyes, repeatedly crossing themselves, deep bass voices, the Field Marshall kneeling) with the pale, cheap, and half-hearted attempt in this sorry sorry production.  No feeling for the Russian soul.  Please,  do not get me started about the whole revisions of personalities and conflicts.  Do NOT buy this POS!!!!",1388275200,8,1165,4.88265306122449
3381937,1,B0015TQQY4,"This is not Tolstoy's War & Peace. In the great Russian writer's epic the characters are all individualized (even some animals!). Here the characters do not resemble Tolstoy's creations; they are neither individualized nor do they develop. In Tolstoy's epic the leading character, Pierre Bezuhov, begins as a confused young man, tries various life styles (drinking, reform of his peasants, free masonry) to find the meaning of life, but in this movie he is simply a blockhead throughout. Natasha, the leading female character is not the vibrant high spirited young girl who develops into a real woman, but a more brooding foolish girl. None of the lesser characters are like their counterparts in the novel. Tolstoy was a great writer who makes the reader feel that this is what life is all about, the day to day living of it and loving all things. This movie does not retain the real characters nor the sense of history of the novel. Above all, Tolstoy's novel is about Russia. There is little of Russia in this movie.
  The best version of War and Peace is the BBC's version starring Anthony Hopkins. This is true to the book and uses the plot and dialogue of the original.",1388102400,15,1175,4.754901960784314

This rendition is my favorite because: (1) It was produced as a mini-series for television and as a result did not have to have ""cuts""
of portions of the storyline as Tolstoy wrote it.
(2) The acting was very good and they brought to life the emotions and portrayed the experiences as Tolstoy wrote them despite the fact that the cast did not include any big name celebrity movie or TV  stars.  The members of this cast deserve accolades for their performances.
And finally (3) I found the cinematography and sound to be of excellent quality.

As a result, I found this very enjoyable to view and have rated it as 5-star and do not hesitate to recommend it to anyone who like myself enjoys this genre of performance and entertainment.",1388016000,7,969,4.616279069767442

3381942,3,B0015TQQY4,"Never expect a screen treatment of Tolstoy's work to be as profound as the original. Any film version is best approached as a kind of comic book illustration. That being said, War and Peace in this ""Golden age of TV"" should be filmed as a multi-season show, not a miniseries, to even begin capturing the novel's depth.

This 2007 adaptation has better overall casting than the '56, '67, or '72 productions. Filming on location in Russia also helps. The Rostov family, Price Andrei, Old Bolkonsky, Helene, Dolokhov, and others are well-realized and well-acted (albeit dubbed into a rather stale English). Pierre is a quite bit leaner than Tolstoy's creation, but appropriately awkward, and a big improvement over the pretty-boy Fonda in '56 or the aging Bondarchuk in '67. As for Natasha, I got over her portrayal as a blonde pretty quickly, and thought Poesy does a serviceable job channeling the young Rostova's Manic-Pixie-Dream-Girl qualities.

The ""War"" scenes are duly enhanced by cgi, but are clearly not the main reason to see this version. The series fares better with the far more budget-friendly ""Peace"" portion of the Novel. Some of the sequences are remarkably faithful (most of the Bolknosky family narrative, for example), but many others were altered for dramatic effect, or to suit modern audiences:
Natasha's friendship with Pierre and acquaintance with Prince Andrei prior to 1811 has been considerably strengthened. Pierre's Masonic brotherhood is omitted, and here he's merely ""studying the Gospel"". Anatole is given a grudge against Andrei to start courting Natasha. The lively and very cinematic scene with Balaga and the gypsies is cut. Part 4 is the weakest, as there are many deviations from Tolstoy's plot to wrap up the story threads even more neatly, and a lot of it feels like by-the-numbers soap opera.

Still, for fans of the book, it's a worthwhile visualization of Tolstoy's characters and their world. With all the flaws, it's still not much worse than the previous versions, and even superior in some ways (mostly the authentic sets and the good looking cast). Just don't get your expectations too high.",1381276800,,2138,5.102857142857143

3381944,5,B0015TQQY4,"This effort keeps the spirit and message of Tolstoy intact. He would have approved.
Every film/theater adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's ""War and Peace"" has naysayers. A novel (originally published in 1869 with 1200+ pages) of this length requires adjustment.
Step aside Anna Karenina and make room for ""War & Peace."" It's just as film-worthy.

This is an elegant look at the high social life of Russia with exquisite period costuming as good as any previously created for epic TV drama. Sensational symphony orchestration. A combo dazzling to the eye & ear. This 2007 version has a great international cast. Amazingly it is nearly impossible to recognize at least 9 of the actors were dubbed in English. It's so well done; it is obvious the actors HAD to be speaking English during the filming. After watching over 7 hours of this adapted drama, you'll wish for more. Alas, Tolstoy wrote no sequel.

The story remains true to the Tolstoy plot and reveals the character of members of 4 Russian society aristocratic families: Bolkonsky, Rostov, Bezukhov, & Kuragin with a bit added time to Boris Drubetsky. Family relationships drive the plot of interaction between socialites in the Napoleonic invasion period, including romances. Much of the Tolstoy philosophical discussion that makes the book so fantastic is left in the book, but not all.

SUBTITLES provided. Unrated but with obvious war violence. This European version refrains from massive gore and blood slinging that seems today to be a must to sell American films.
1-- 1805. Natasha (Clemence Poesy) eyes married Prince Andrej (Alessio Boni) who has personal visions of being a hero of fighting men. His friend Pierre (Alexander Beyer) inherits while the country prepares for war against the Napoleon threat. 4 family paths begin to cross. Andrej's father played by Malcolm McDowell, and you'll love to hate him. Aging socialite Marja Dmitrijewna Achrosimowa played by Brenda Blethyn (`Vera').

2-- 1811-12. Count Pierre is yet struggling with responsibilities and marriage. There is war-fighting danger to face for the soldiers of the 4 families. Greed, power, and revenge weight heavily; as do romances amid families.

3-- Nuptial rumor instigates renewed sabotage attempts on individual's charateer and status. Napoleon's wicked tactics of battle encourages Pierre's inclusion at the Battle of Borodino, Sep 7, 1812.

4-- 1813. Residents of Moscow run ahead of Napoleon's advances. Natasha, Marja Bolkonsky (Valentina Cervi), & Pierre all make decisions based on the unfurling tumult. Who will die; who will live on to love?
