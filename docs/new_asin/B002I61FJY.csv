3935896,5,B002I61FJY,"QUANTUM OF SOLACE is a superior hard-edged James Bond film. Daniel Craig commands the screen with his strong visual presence and captivating aplomb as Ian Fleming's dedicated civil servant. Craig's interpretation of Ian Fleming's James Bond is that of man of few words, but whose mind never sleeps, ultimately to get the job done. He is a physically fit, brutally effective thinking man's Bond. He has a certain unfathomable charm and sardonic humor that makes him appealing to the opposite sex on screen and to the audience as well. The plot of QUANTUM OF SOLACE is character driven.

Looking at QUANTUM OF SOLACE closer, this film is really more of a study of James Bond and his world. This is very evident in Bond's scenes with Ren Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) and then again with his scene with Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright). The tone of QUANTUM OF SOLACE is very dark and realistic. It is not a glamorous film as has been a hallmark of the series. It is a personal film. David Arnold's score once again continues to break new ground into Bond's hard-edged world. Arnold's ""What's Keeping You Awake"" is a very reflective piece and ""Field Trip"" is a real throwback to the classic Bond sound created by John Barry. I was glad to see that an actual Ian Fleming title was used for this film. I think this was rather fitting.

QUANTUM OF SOLACE has swept aside and maligned since the release of SKYFALL. QUANTUM OF SOLACE was the second film of the James Bond re-boot started with CASINO ROYALE. Somehow SKYFALL seemed to not follow the continuity after QUANTUM OF SOLACE where Bond was on the top of his game. Of the 3 Daniel this far, QUANTUM OF SOLACE is my favorite.

I always considered DR. NO to be one of the better Bond films and closer to the literary James Bond created by Ian Fleming. Sean Connery's performance is that of the no-nonsense dedicated civil servant. His screen presence alone conveys the physical, intellectual and moral conviction of the character. He is essentially a modern day version of the white knight slaying the dragon for Queen and country.

Joseph Wiseman as Dr. No is one of the best villains of the series. His steel mono-toned performance is eerily unsettling. He remains one of the most enigmatic villains in the series. He is a villain moved more by unfounded revenge than by greed or riches. You almost sympathize with him as he makes futile overtures to Bond imploring him to join his organization. It seems that Bond is the only man capable of appreciating his intellect. Not even Dr. No's backers, Blofeld and S.P.E.C.T.R.E. are worthy of his talents.

Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder leaves one of the most indelible images of the series as she emerges from the sea clad in her white bikini. She is characterized by the simplicity of her goodness and naivet' as she is drawn into a vortex of worldliness that Bond further engulfs her in. Rather than that of a supposed sex object, she exudes a raw femininity found only in nature. Bond can not help but feel that he has corrupted her both deliberately and inadvertently in his blind quest to revenge the deaths of fellow agents. This is the very strength of Richard Maibaum's script, here and on subsequent Bond films.

These films, the better ones, are about Bond, his adversaries, his loves and his friendships. Jack Lord was the first of many actors to play Felix Leiter, Bond's CIA friend. ""Friend"" in the world of James Bond is not a word used casually. Lord seemed the one actor to visually convey the camaraderie that existed between these two characters. John Kitzmiller gave a very good performance as the loyal Quarrel, one of the most important characters in he entire series. This character epitomized the dormant qualities found in the instincts of the common man. When called upon in the death struggle of good vs. evil he is prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice.

Anthony Dawson as Professor Dent seems perfect as a man who knew better than fall into an inescapable web of subterfuge that Dr. No has spread from his island to the mainland. Zena Marshall as Miss Taro is a more willing participant, as she appears eager to overtly display her sensuality and share her sexual appetites openly with Bond. She is supposed to lure Bond to his death. Finding this not the case she enthusiastically offers herself to Bond. It is in these scenes that Sean Connery displays a certain animal screen presence that no other actor has ever equaled in the role.

Many elements that distinguish a James Bond movie were introduced in this film. The opening gun barrel trademark, ""The James Bond Theme,"" Bernard Lee's portrayal of the inimitable M, Lois Maxwell's portrayal of the desirable Miss Moneypenny, Ken Adam's innovative and distinctive production designs, Maurice Binder's unique main titles, the ""Martinis shaken not stirred,"" just to name a few are all here.

Director, Terence Young, always boasted and took relish in how he supposedly shaped the look and feel of the James Bond series. This is quite possibly true when looking at DR. NO. It is a film visually rich with well-detailed and defined characters. It also has an uncanny feel for the settings inspired from the Ian Fleming novels whether it be Bond's intelligence headquarters in London, the exotic sights and sounds of Jamaica or the incongruity of Dr. No's plush lair hidden in the mosquito invested swamps of Crabe Key.

DR. NO is also characterized by quick paced editing by Peter Hunt. Hunt's innovative technique keeps the story moving visually and unobtrusively which also further defines the cinematic world of James Bond.

But coming full circle, it is Sean Connery's performance and screen presence that intrigues and captures the imagination of the viewer. Given the sets, the music, the script, the locations and all the other elements, it all comes down to how Sean Connery fits and moves through this cinematic world that has been created for James Bond. Sean Connery's performance is indeed that of Britain's dedicated civil servant. DR. NO is the benchmark.",1424822400,,6040,4.826086956521739

But Daniel Craig is so good as James Bond and the supporting cast is always so good, that it makes up for the hard to follow story.  Maybe there's a website that breaks down each movie.  I'll have to check.  In any event, it's good entertainment and escapism.",1498435200,,383,4.414285714285715

This is not one of his best but I still love him as James Bond, so he's in this movie, SO, therefore I love this movie!  Like most James Bond movies it's fast paced and suspenseful and thrilling.  So MANY great actors in this one, but MY personal stand outs are Jeffery Wright and of course, Judi Dench as ""M.""  She is AWESOME!  If you're a James Bond fan AND happen to be partial to James Craig, then you'll enjoy this film probably as much as I did.  Hey, see it, after all it IS James BOND!",1491004800,2,572,4.0

3935923,2,B002I61FJY,"Roger Moore put it best, saying the action scenes have ""no sense of geography"". If you are not Paul Greengrass, don't try to make a Paul Greengrass movie. His jump-cutting style in the Bourne movies is well-planned and thought through, and The Bourne Ultimatum is a masterpiece of action filmmaking. Marc Forster's Quantum of Solace is just a blizzard of quick cuts with little sense. The only visuals that make an impression occur when the film takes a breath: an old woman's box of groceries shatters on a stone floor, a fighter plane swoops in low over a desert hillside, Bond and Camille in black evening clothes stroll out of a featureless, ochre-colored landscape. In its favor, it has Craig's best performance as Bond, a woman worthy of and equal to Bond, and a great musical score by David Arnold.",1470700800,5,805,4.757142857142857
