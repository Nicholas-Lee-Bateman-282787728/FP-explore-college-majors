7839853,5,630316000X,"There is so much that has been written,movies,etc. about Whyat Earp that the line from Kenny Rogers song ""The Gambler""...:partly truth and partly fiction"",cannot help but come to mind. When I came upon this double VHS set I really didn't know what to make of it. It didn't appear to be a movie as there were no actors mentioned on the cover. All it said was that it was a ""Collector's Edition"".The only images on the package were a youthful photo of Wyatt on the front and an aged photo of him on the back. As I have seen and read so much about Wyatt over the years;I decided to buy it like a ""pig in a poke"". The package gave no information as to whether it was in color or B & W.All it said was that it was a 2 tape set,and a short bit about Wyatt Earp on the back.
 Before even opening it, I decided to check the Reviews on Amazon. Searching under ""Wyatt Earp"" ,I couldn't find anything that seemed to be this set. I researched under ""The Sheriff of Tombstone Wyatt Earp"" and there it was ,exactly like mine. To my surprise there were only 6 Reviews,but highly rated as 4 1/2 *.
 I opened it and found each tape was only 45 minutes .It wasn't until I watched it that I found out it was totally B & W.So, in watching these two tapes;the more I watched,the more impressed I became. Rather than being a movie or biography;it is really a documentary.
 It was researched and produced by Dan Dalton Productions .They set out to separate the truth from all the fiction that has been generated through the media. At the end ,it gives recognition to all the Historical organizations,Museums,Libraries.etc.that were involved in researching the life of Earp. I am certainly no historical expert on Earp;but I am really convinced that this documentary is more than excellent. It does a very good job of mixing still photographs with moving pictures. It is difficult,however, to sort out where the pictures came from and whether or not some were from movies;but that really doesn't matter.
 I read all the reviews,but at times I had difficulty connecting what they said with what I found in the 2 tapes. I wonder if they were talking about the same tapes as I watched. Just to clarify;my set looks exactly like that shown here. It is Copyrite 1993 by Dan Dalton Productions and distributed by Display AmericaInc. It has Number3079 on the back cover.
 All in hall, there is an awful amount of information that is probably as factual as is possible to assemble. There is also considerable information about legends and pure fiction and by whom and why it was created.
I am glad I bought it and believe that anyone who is interested in sorting out the truth about Wyatt Earp from the legend and fiction would be impressed with this set. However,I must agree with the reviewer who wondered why it was split into 2 tapes.
 By the way,the background music is outstanding.",1419984000,,2855,4.51257253384913
7839854,5,630316000X,Love this movie--stars Hugh O'Brian--one of my favorite actors in this role.  I am going to watch this movie again and again.,1377734400,,125,4.681818181818182
7839855,5,630316000X,"Please ignore the number of stars for this review. Not appropriate here. In assembling a list of all Wyatt Earp films ever made, I came across this lesser known film with Hugh O'Brien doing a reprisal of his original role as Wyatt Earp in the TV series, The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, that ran for quite a few years. I found the review entitled ""Looking back at Wyatt Earp's TV series"" very helpful toward understanding what the listed feature is all about. But if I may, I would like to offer one correction and one embellishment to the review:

FROM TEXT OF REVIEW: ""... Harry Carey Jr. was the son of Harry Carey, a great silent film western star and one of John Ford's longtime friends with whom he did 27 films. The son did 9 films with Ford, including the cavalry trilogy, ""Wagon Master"" (1950), ""The Searchers"" (1956) and ""Two Rode Together"" (1961)...""

Actually, John Ford's ""cavalry trilogy"" is generally thought to be the three films: Fort Apache (1948), She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949), and Rio Grande (1950). Harry Carey Jr. Starred in the latter two of these films, and also the three films the reviewer quoted as part of that trilogy. Just noting this for the record. ;>

Two additional notes: Harry Carey Jr. Also appeared in a cameo role in the best Wyatt Earp film ever made, Tombstone, as town marshal Fred White. And since the reviewer mentioned a sci-fi role for Bruce Boxleitner, let us not forget that dear Bruce was in one of the best science films ever made; TRON (he was in both the original and the sequel, although I am giving reference to the original)

OK, I lied; TWO embellishments.",1337644800,,1617,4.56551724137931
7839856,5,630316000X,"Jahrelang war ich hinterher und jetzt habe ich ihn endlich und auch gleich angesehen:
erwartet hatte ich irgendwie was anderes als das was dann kam > KEINE DOKU, KEIN neuer Western mit Hugh O'Brian, nein.
Aber was dann kommt haut einem vom Hocker !! Ausf&uuml;hrliche Ausschnitte aus der Serie > UND DAS IN FARBE !!! UND KLASSE !!!
Wer die Serie nicht von fr&uuml;her kennt, k&ouml;nnte denken die ist frisch gedreht worden! So gut ist die Colorierung! Das ist ein Hammer!!
Da wird einem seit 50 Jahren solch eine PERLE der Western-Serien vorenthalten, verschimmelt im Archiv > EINE ABSOLUTE SCHANDE!!!
Vor Jahren gab es ein sogenanntes ""Best of"" der Serie auf DVD allerdings nur in englisch und s/w - ABER DAS WAR SCHON MAL WAS!
Allerdings so, wie wenn man einem Stra&szlig;enk&ouml;ter einem Knochen hinwirft... > das ist bei diesem Film NICHT ANDERS!
Erst einem den Mund w&auml;ssrig machen und dann kommt nichts mehr!! Was sind das f&uuml;r Hirnis, die bei sowas das Sagen haben ??
K&uuml;rzlich habe ich mal wieder Wyatt Earp im Internet in USA gesucht und was mu&szlig;te ich feststellen > mittlerweile gibt es die erste Staffel komplett auf DVD! Hab ich jetzt nat&uuml;rlich auch und bin am gucken...
Nat&uuml;rlich in s/w - BESSER ALS GAR NICHTS!!! Ich hoffe nur, das ALLE Staffeln KOMPLETT auf DVD erscheinen, wenn auch zun&auml;chst in s/w!!! (hechel)
GLEICHZEITIG sollte man aber JETZT die Serie IN FARBE produzieren und sowie die einzelnen Staffeln in Farbe vorliegen, ver&ouml;ffentlichen!
Der absolute Hammer w&auml;re nat&uuml;rlich eine deutsche Synchronisation! Die damalige Synchro-Stimme war schon perfekt ausgesucht (so perfekt, wie die Rolle mit Hugh O'Brian besetzt war) > heute vielleicht die von Bond-Brosnan ? Denke die w&uuml;rde sicher gut passen.
Was damals NICHT so gut gepa&szlig;t hat, war die Besetzung der Rolle des DOC HOLLIDAY > hier wurde uns ein zum Drehzeitpunkt fast 50zig-j&auml;hriger pr&auml;sentiert, obwohl Doc Holliday zur Filmzeit erst Anfang 30 war! Er ist ja bereits mit 34 Jahren an Tuberkulose, die er sich bei einem Patienten eingefangen hatte, gestorben! (Hat mich damals schon gest&ouml;rt, da ich die B&uuml;cher kannte) Allerdings pa&szlig;te der Typ - nur eben 20 Jahre j&uuml;nger!
Was ebenfalls nicht pa&szlig;te, ist die Tatsache, das Doc Holliday in der Serie st&auml;ndig mit EINEM Revolver heruml&auml;uft, obwohl doch in der ganzen Serie zu LESEN ist, das er der perfekte Zweihandmann war und IMMER zwei Revolver trug! Und das, obwohl Stuart N.Lake, der Biograph von Wyatt Earp, die Serie begleitete! Gewehre mochte er nicht und hat sie auch so gut wie nie benutzt.
Noch etwas zu dieser DVD > hier st&ouml;ren (und das war NICHT angegeben) die Untertitel in Holl&auml;ndisch die NICHT abschaltbar sind total!!
Warum haben die Holl&auml;nder das nicht auch gleich in DEUTSCH untertitelt und die M&ouml;glichkeit der Wahl einger&auml;umt?
Wegen diesem Lapsus w&uuml;rde ich, wenn es 10 Sterne geben w&uuml;rde , nur 9 vergeben. Da es aber nur f&uuml;nf gibt, sehe ich dar&uuml;ber hinweg - die Serie ist einfach nur super!
Gleiches gilt f&uuml;r die Serie in s/w > nur 9 wegen der fehlenden Farbe! Ganz einfach deshalb, weil es ja FARBFILME schon gab - nicht erst seit 1959.
Und die Besetzung des DOC HOLLIDAY mu&szlig; man dabei auch noch ber&uuml;cksichtigen...

I was many years' behind and now I have looked at him, finally, and also immediately:
I had expected anyhow something else than what then there came> NO DOCUMENT, NO new western with Hugh O'Brian.
But what comes then lashes out to one of the stool!! Detailed cuttings from the series> AND IN COLOUR!!! AND CLASS!!!
Who knows the series not from former times, could think it has freshly been turned! So well is the Colorierung! This is a hammer!!
There such will keep from one for 50 years BUBBLES of the west series, goes mouldy in the archive> AN ABSOLUTE DISGRACE!!!
Years ago there was so-called ""Best of"" of the series on DVD, however, only in in English and s/w - BUT THIS WAS ALREADY WHAT!
Indeed in such a way, as if one to a street cur to a bone throws down...> this is not with this film DIFFERENT!
Only the mouth make watery and then nothing more comes!! What are for Hirnis which have with something so the legends??
Recently I have looked once more Wyatt Earp on the Internet in the USA and what I had to ascertain> meanwhile there is the first relay completely on DVD! If I also have now of course and am in look...
Of course in s/w - BETTER THAN EVEN NOTHING!!! I hope only that ALL relays COMPLETELY appear on DVD, even if first in s/w!!! (hechel)
NOW, however, AT THE SAME TIME one should produce the series in COLOUR and as well as be given the single relays in colour, publish!
The absolute hammer would be of course a German synchronisation! The Synchro voice at that time was selected quite perfectly (thus perfectly, how was the role with Hugh O'Brian taken)> today maybe those by Bond-Brosnan? If she thinks would fit surely well.
What has not fitted at that time so well, here the occupation of the role of the DOC HOLLIDAY> was was presented to us one to the shooting time point nearly 50 year-old, although Doc Holliday was at the film time only in the beginning of 30! He has died already at the age of 34 years of the tuberculosis which he had caught to himself with a patient! (Has me at that time already disturbed, because I knew the books), However fitted the type - only just 20 years younger!
What also did not fit, is the fact, the Doc Holliday in the series constantly with A revolver walks around, although, nevertheless, is in the whole series to READING which it perfect Twohandman was and ALWAYS carried two revolvers! And this, although Stuart N.Lake, the biographer of Wyatt Earp which accompanied series! He did not like guns and has also practically never used them.
Something else to this DVD> disturb here (and this was not given) the subtitles into Dutch NOT are complete switchable!!
Why have the Dutchmen not subtitled this also immediately into GERMAN and have put away the possibility of the choice?
Because of this mistake I would award if there were 10 stars only 9. Because there are, however, only five, I see over it - the series is just great!
Same is valid for the series in s/w> only 9 because of the missing colour! Quite simply, because there were COLOUR FILMS already - not only since 1959.
And one must consider the occupation of the DOC HOLLIDAY, besides, still...",1274400000,,6453,4.871701546860782
7839857,4,630316000X,"If you were fans of the ""Wyatt Earp"" TV series (1955 - 61), and who over the age of 50 wasn't, then you'll enjoy this unique show. Basically we have star Hugh O'Brian returning to Tombstone after 35 years to look for his newly discovered nephew, and in the process, the film gives us 4 clips from the original series, told in flashbacks. We get the episode with Ned Buntline (Lloyd Corrigan) giving Earp his famous gun, the episode in which Old Man Clanton (Trevor Bardette) gets killed by the Mexicans, and the famous gunfight at the OK Corral with Doc Holiday (Douglas Fowley).

O'Brian is best remembered for his years on the TV series, but in addition he was a Golden Globe winner as Most Promising Newcomer for his role in ""The Man from the Alamo"" (1953) and made dozens of films before the TV series hit. He did a great job as Arnold Schwartznegger's father in the 1988 hit ""Twins"" and pops up occasionally in TV movies, occasionally reprising his role as Earp (e.g., ""The Gambler Returns"").

The current film has brief appearances by Harry Carey Jr, Bruce Boxleitner, Bo Hopkins and Paul Brinegar.

Harry Carey Jr. was the son of Harry Carey, a great silent film western star and one of John Ford's longtime friends with whom he did 27 films. The son did 9 films with Ford, including the cavalry trilogy, ""Wagon Master"" (1950), ""The Searchers"" (1956) and ""Two Rode Together"" (1961). Though he specialized in westerns, he also appeared in ""Mr. Roberts"" (1955) and ""The Long Grey Line"" (1955). Carey is the only actor left from the Golden era of Western films, and continues to act - he made a brief appearance in ""Back to the Future Part 3"" (1990), ""Tombstone"" (1993) and hosted a TV special about Western films in 2010.

Bruce Boxleitner was the star of the best damn TV sci-fi series ever, ""Babylon 5"" (1994-8). He has been in several other TV series (""How the West was Won"", ""Scarecrow and Mrs. King"") and in films as well (""Tron"", ""Gods and Generals"", ""The Babe"").

Bo Hopkins played Crazy Clarence in Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch"" (1969) and worked with him again in ""The Getaway"" (1972) and ""The Killer Elite"" (1975). He's been in more than 100 films, often westerns (""Cat Ballou"", ""Culpepper Cattle Co"", ""Posse"")

Paul Brinegar has the distinction of appearing in the flashbacks and in the present day - in both cases playing Jim ""Dog"" Kelly. Brinegar played in more than 100 films starting in 1946. He's best known for his recurring role on the TV series ""Rawhide"" (1959-65) where he played ""Wishbone"". This was Brinegar final film. He died in 1995.

The concept for the film is excellent, but the implementation is questionable. Earp is looking for the son of his brother Virgil, but the young man who plays the part is only 26 years old and looks even younger. The event, in 1914, takes place 30+ years after Virgil Earp left Tombstone, so it's difficult to imagine how Virgil is the man's father, as Virgil lived in California. In addition, Earp tells his new found nephew that he has a family and then promptly leaves town the next moment. Hardly a ""family reunion"".

Leaving aside the historical problems, fans of the original series will certainly enjoy seeing the old B&W episodes colorized, and watching these key episodes.",1272499200,7,3243,4.707231040564374
7839858,4,630316000X,"I saw Tombstone and loved it.  I looked up Wyatt Earp on the Internet and found a beautifully done Web Site dedicated to him.  I was surprised that he died in 1929, in Colma, Calif.  Since I live in Calif. and it wasn't that long ago, I wanted to learn more.  While ordering the movie, Wyatt Earp (which was also great) I ordered this documentary.  It was very good with lots of good historical pictures.  I wish that there had been a larger variety of pictures available.  I noticed the same pictures being reused several times.  I liked the use of the maps of the OK Corral, Tombstone and of the cattle trails from Texas to Kansas.  I would have liked to seen more on how Wyatt winds up in Colma, Calif. and where that might be located.  This documentary just causes me to search for more answers.
Also, I was very curious about the Directors, Producers and the musical scores all being done by the Dalton family?  If there was any historical connection or relationship between them and the Earps or the Dalton ""gang""?
I would like to complain about the decision to produce the 82 min video in the EP Mode or long play mode.  Then they made it into a 2 video Tape Set.  So in the middle of the documentary you have to get up and change the video.  Why do the Distributor's do that?  I will probably have the video professionally cut onto one tape, but then I will still have to keep the extra tape, because the cover that it came in is for 2 tapes and is too nice to get rid of.  I just hate to have to store extra videos if I didn't have to.
It is still worth seeing.",974505600,2,1570,4.20066889632107
7839859,5,630316000X,"Documentaries in my opinion are always better than the hollywood version  because they don't embellish whatsoever, and what Wyatt Earp was was one of  the most dangerous men in American history.  This is a must see, especially  if you're a history buff.",965692800,,253,4.9523809523809526
