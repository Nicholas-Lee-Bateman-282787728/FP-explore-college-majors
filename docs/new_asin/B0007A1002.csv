2207817,5,B0007A1002,"I'm with the first reviewer - when are the DVDs coming out? Of all the cooking shows I've ever watched, this was the most entertaining and it features fabulous recipes to boot. If Jennifer Patterson had not departed this world for the great culinary cook-off in the sky, I'm certain the series would still be going strong. On top of the ladies' big personalities and deliciously sly humor, one also gets to meet and know  quirky and compelling characters all over a splendidly photographed Britain.",1149292800,6,498,4.858823529411764
2207818,5,B0007A1002,When is this show coming out on DVD? A couple of foxy English babes.,1116115200,14,68,3.9285714285714284

8046504,5,B0007A1002,"Loved these two when they were irreverently cooking on the show.  I would scramble to jot down the recipes as they were cooking, now I have the whole set.  The only regret, and it was my fault, was I did not buy it in DVD format.  After all who uses tape anymore!",1399334400,,263,4.019230769230769

8046506,5,B0007A1002,"I dropped an e-mail message to Acorn Media, the company that released all 24 episodes in the U.K. as, ""Two Fat Ladies - Complete Tribute [1996],"" if there were plans to release it in Region 1 format(U.S.A.--the U.K. is Region 2, PAL). A quick response was received: Yes!

The 4 DVD set will be available directly from the company's catalogue early to mid-June 2008. On July 29, 2008 it will be available here at Amazon (and stores).

All 24 episodes are on these DVDs. From the Amazon.co.uk site, that's 736 minutes of programs:

I just checked and it can not be preordered here yet.",1207699200,2,693,5.571428571428571
8046507,5,B0007A1002,"I love these videos. WHEN will it ever come to DVD in the U.S.??? Even getting our hands on used VHS is nearly impossible. Fortunately my library has them and I keep borrowing them. But I digress...

Clarissa and Jennifer are the extremely affable duo of food aficionados. These shows are formatted so not only do you get to learn a thing or two about cooking, but the places they travel to are beautiful, they always cook in a different kitchen, they get from place to place in a motorcycle and sidecar, and all is done in such an intimate way that we feel we are there with them. Jocularity ensues, and their sideline stories, quips, and singing are all icing on top of this cake of delicious fun.

I wish there were more, but sadly, Jennifer passed on. We must savor these wonderful shows.",1189641600,,792,4.455172413793103

Sadly, there is no sign of that anytime soon in the US, if at all.  HOWEVER, if you have a Universal DVD player - the Brits are releasing it on Oct 8, 2007.  Go to <<Amazon.co.uk>> to order IF you can play Region 2 DVDs.  Otherwise, we shall just have to wait.  It appears as if it includes a tribute to Jennifer Paterson as well as most likely the same shows available on the VHS 5 Boxed Set.  I own the set on VHS and still enjoy it from time to time, along with the cookbooks by Jennifer and Clarissa.  Clarissa has continued on producing various books and her autobiography is due this Fall in the UK  ""Spilling the Beans"".  You can ask to be alerted when it is avaialble on Amazon.com (US) by clicking on a link after you type in the title.  Anyway, let's all hope this means a DVD of the famous fat duo will soon be available here!",1188345600,3,1720,6.638392857142857
8046509,5,B0007A1002,"Having these tapes brought back so many great memories of watching not only two extraordinary people who know can create great food, but also create great comedy.  Yummy!",1156636800,3,170,5.071428571428571
8046510,5,B0007A1002,"I inquired of New River Media a while back regarding this wonderful set being issued in the DVD format.  I, unfortunately haven't heard back from them yet.  However, a few thousand more inquiries......

It could make a difference.",1155859200,2,230,5.0
8046511,5,B0007A1002,"Apparently, a lucrative enough deal has not been made to bring Two Fat Ladies to DVD. If there is demand for any product, you can rest assured that it will be available sometime....... So when is it going to be time for the DVD? We TFL fans are probably not 12-24 year old boys, so it might be a while....",1152144000,4,305,4.1
8046512,5,B0007A1002,I don't own a VCR and it sure is a shame not to be able to watch the ladies in action.  One of the best cooking shows on television,1150070400,5,131,3.5172413793103448
