8649115,5,B00J9Q88CI,"My son loves the Shawn the Train YouTube videos. I decided to buy the DVD, which has over 2 hours of video content. A lot of the video is not available online, so he did not get bored with it.

The video helps reinforce what we teach him and what he learns in pre-school. He knows his shapes, colors, and some of the letters now. He will usually sit down for the whole video, which is surprising. The girls seem to like it too.

Highly recommend!",1412640000,2,446,4.174418604651163
8649116,5,B00J9Q88CI,Excellent for every child who loves trains. My son actually loves it even more than Thomas & Friends probably because Shawn is better for younger kids (2-3 years),1404086400,,162,4.821428571428571
8649117,5,B00J9Q88CI,"We do not watch much TV at home, so we try to use You Tube videos every once in a while to find sing a longs, cute/short videos to entertain our LO. We first found Shawn on You Tube about a 6 months ago when my son was 18 mo. He was in love the first time he watched. Shawn's voice is super annoying, but you get used to it after a while and it is now endearing to me when I hear it. We bought the video cause LO is now 2 and I feel better about him watching TV on a little more regular basis. This video also saves us meltdowns on days that our internet is running slow  ; - )",1398470400,4,577,3.653225806451613
8649118,5,B00J9Q88CI,"My 23 month old has been watching Coilbook clips on YouTube for a couple of months, and can't get enough. Every video is educational - he has learned to count to 10, knows his shapes and colors, and is starting to pick out letters on his own. Obviously, I work with him in teaching this basic knowledge (I have an education degree), but Shawn the Train is excellent at reinforcing these concepts. I'm so happy to have a DVD that has all of the letters!",1396828800,2,452,4.329411764705882
