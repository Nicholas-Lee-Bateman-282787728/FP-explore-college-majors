8564101,5,B00B8CV4NG,"I saw this a few years ago when I was living in Thailand.  After that I looked and looked for a DVD with English subtitles - was impossible to find in Thailand.  The movie is fun, heartwarming, sad, happy, and gives a good look/feel of life in Thailand, and definitely brings back very very fond memories of when I lived here and used to ride the BTS (overhead rail system).  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE!!  SEE IT, YOU WILL LIKE IT!!",1367020800,2,433,4.375
