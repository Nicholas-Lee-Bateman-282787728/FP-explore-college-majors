8372938,4,B002LFPBGA,"OK movie, but a little bit too much talk, like in many french movies",1423699200,,68,3.9285714285714284
8372939,5,B002LFPBGA,"DVD arrived very quickly.

The movie itself is pretty cute. I'm trying to learn French and am watching it to listen to them speak.",1311552000,3,130,4.416666666666667
8372940,5,B002LFPBGA,"Once again a transformative character is brought fully to life by Oscar winner and acting genius Marion Cotillard.  The lesson of this film is how love, even if missed but accepted in oneself, can bring both authentic life and creative risk.  The fun is the magazine TOI ET MOI really does exist in France, according to my French translator, and is quite popular. This makes Depardieu's character much more real.  Cotillard, of course, disappears into the cellist; her cello work is great, too.",1301097600,3,494,4.927710843373494
