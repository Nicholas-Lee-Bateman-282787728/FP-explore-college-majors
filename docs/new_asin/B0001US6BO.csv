2024438,4,B0001US6BO,"Normally, I would give Denise a completely glowing review, but this workout was a bit different. Things I greatly enjoyed were the program: 25 minutes of cardio, followed by 10 minutes segements of arms, legs and abs. Also, the DVD version came equipped with a resistance band, which is necessary to participate in the workout. My criticism is that the whole DVD seems either rushed or was a production after-thought. The music is pretty generic and Denise's spoken introduction is part of the workout, you can skip it manually, but it isn't its own chapter. That's kind of annoying. As for the workout itself, it is very good. During the cardio, you jump around and sweat, all the while using the resistance band for simultaneous toning. The moves are simple, yet effective and the band is a wonderful piece of equipment to weave into your own personal home workout routine, it makes your muscles adjust, as weight routines cause muscle memory over time and your muscles grow accustomed and don't work as hard. Her workout group is made up of people who are thin and fit, but don't look super-ripped or sickly, which is nice and semi-realistic, not intimidating like others can be. She recommends a 6 day schedule, but I think that people who have been working out for a while or have some sort of fitness savvy can decide for themselves, though it is nice to have some guidelines for those just starting out or unsure of how to go about things. She jumps right in, so there is no real explanation section. While the moves are not extremely difficult, there are just barely enough reps to get it right, but that is something that will resolve itself over time. And my last bit of criticism is that Denise seems either tired or a bit disinterested in the workout, she didn't seem as into it as her previous videos. However, she does take the time to really explain the mucles being worked and proper form on her fellow workoutmates. I would like to think of this review as overall a positive one, I just think that if I were to read a review, I would like to know of the negative aspects, to make a well-informed decision.",1086307200,245,2122,4.601583113456464
2024439,5,B0001US6BO,"I have used the cassette version for few years and have always help me to stay fit. My cassette finally gave up, so I bought the cd version. Great product.",1363824000,,155,4.2
2024440,4,B0001US6BO,"This is a great workout DVD with 25 minutes of cardio using exercise bands to strengthen your muscles.  Following that, there are workouts of 10 minutes each for your upper body, lower body and abs to target all those areas as well.  I feel like this workout really works the entire body and does boost your metabolism and energy, but I wish it had a bit more of a warm up and more of a cool down with stretching at the end, as I could use that (I'm in my 50's and enjoy the stretching as I'm trying to stay limber.)  A longer resistance band is very helpful for these exercises, and for me the 4 foot ones weren't quite long enough, so I ended up buying 6 foot resistance bands to use with this routine and that worked out great for me.",1361664000,,737,4.13986013986014
2024441,5,B0001US6BO,"I've been doing this workout for years and I love.  It raises my metabolism and still has me sweating after all these years.  My only complaint is with the ab section, it's a bit lame.  I always skip the abs and do them on my own.  If you are looking to burn fat and tone this is a great DVD.",1336521600,,292,3.816666666666667
2024442,5,B0001US6BO,I was somewhat satisfied with my purchase.  The resistance band wasn't included. I was a bit disappointed.,1279670400,,106,5.235294117647059
2024443,4,B0001US6BO,"She looks great though.
Haven't gotten a chance to do this yet, due to health problems.",1250035200,,87,4.5
2024444,1,B0001US6BO,"I've had this dvd for about 5 years and today was the second time I've used it. I wanted to try something different and saw this hidden on the back of the shelf, so I popped it in the dvd player to give it a try. Within two minutes I realized why this dvd has been collecting dust all these years...it is AWFUL! First of all, the resistance band sticks together like glue (at least mine did anyway) and it hurts when you need to wrap it around your hands to do certain exercises. Denise and her group of workout buddies seem to have no trouble adjusting the band to exactly where it needs to be. I, on the other hand, had to keep fidgeting with it, which caused me to loose step with the workout. Aside from the band issues, the aerobic workout itself is pretty bad. The sashay, pony and mambo are typical Denise moves, but I feel like such an idiot doing them. They are boring besides. Denise is also terrible at cuing all of the moves. You're on your own as far as keeping step. Needless to say, I quickly lost interest in this dvd and didn't even bother moving on to the strength training section of the workout. I really should just throw it right in the trash.",1248480000,3,1165,4.228699551569507
2024445,4,B0001US6BO,"Its half cardio, half toning with bands. Not very long, I think 20 min each. It's good and its programmable.  The key to working out with bands is the bands resistance level.  If you workout with weights, you probably need a heavier band.  Its good to have in your rotation.  Not a very heavy workout, but I would say medium to light.  I use the Firm and Prevention alot, so that's what I'm comparing this one to.
I think this has been released with different dates, so check to see if the date makes a difference.",1223078400,,514,4.3125
2024446,3,B0001US6BO,"Denise Austin is great.. The only problem I had with this video was the  band they used. After the first use, it was a mess (because of the sweat of my hands) it wouldn't stretch properly anymore. You can still workout with this video without the band but it is a little more tricky to do because they use the band. If you are talented, you can get a great workout with this video without the band. I was not impressed with the band at all. I would not recommend this video for beginners.",1207958400,,488,4.191489361702128
2024447,5,B0001US6BO,"I am a very experienced home and class exerciser and like this dvd because it gives a total workout... cardio, upper body, lower body, abs... in an interesting, effective, quick, and simple to follow format.  When resistance is necessary the band can be substituted with hand weights which are more desirable to me because they're more comfortable to use.",1199232000,2,355,5.016949152542373
2024448,4,B0001US6BO,"I just received this DVD and was disappointed, after reading the reviews commenting on the inclusion of a resistance band, to find that there was no band included with my purchase.  Just a heads up for those of you who may order this item in the future, the resistance band apparently is no longer included with this version.",1190073600,2,325,4.603448275862069
2024459,5,B0001US6BO,"In this DVD, Denise Austin incorporates a resistance band for an additionally intense workout. The results are excellent. The DVD contains a 25 minute interval cardio workout utilizing the resistance band to burn more calories and strengthen muscle along with endurance. There are also three strength training segments for arms, legs, and abs. (The abs workout does not use the band).

I found the use of the resistance band, which is included free with the DVD, a wonderful idea. I felt I was getting more of a workout for the time I spent in the cardio section. As for the strength training segments, I found that I like using the band as an alternative to the hand-weights that I use most of the time.

As per usual, Denise is very energetic and enthusiastic in this DVD. Her positive attitude and zest really motivate me to workout my hardest. This is another wonderful workout from Denise Austin!",1184889600,6,901,4.769230769230769
2024460,3,B0001US6BO,"I bought this DVD for to try something different. I figured Denise Austin has been around for years, I'll give her a try. I have quite a few home work out videos, so I'm not new to them. The toning section is pretty good on this DVD. I enjoyed it and I felt it.

HOWEVER, the cardio section was jumpy to say the least. She's all over the place and SUPER HYPER. I couldn't help but wonder, what kind of drugs is this woman on??? By the time I figured out what she was doing she was moving on to something else. Plus, she wasn't always saying when she was changing to a different exercise, which made it even more frustrating. I didn't enjoy it AT ALL. If all this DVD had was the cardio portion, I would throw it in the trash. There are a lot of other fun and easy to follow cardio DVDs out there that work.

Again, the toning section was pretty good. I liked it and it is the type of work out that you can choose how difficult you want to make it by your hold on the resistance band, which I thought was great since some days you don't want to kill yourself, but you want to do something. She should stick to teaching toning routines. She's much better at them.",1181952000,,1161,4.087719298245614
2024461,4,B0001US6BO,"This workout is split up into different sections but initially I was confused where one segment ended and another began.  During the cardio workout she says ""this is the stregnth training segment"" -or something to that affect-and I thought it was the section separate from the cardio that focused on stregnth training but it wasn't-it was a stregnth training within the cardio chapter.  It does eventually get to the stregnthening exercises and it's very clearly divided but I didn't know that initially.

Really, that's my only complaint about this work out.  No biggie.  I enjoy the exercises themselves. You do need weights (dumbbells) and an exercise strap though.  I didn't know that when I  bought it so you may want to get those things if you're going to get this cd.

The routines were fairly easy but challenging-not ridiculously challenging though-I'm a beginner and it was just enough for me.  I can feel it in my arms and legs and I worked up a good sweat.

I liked how she explains how to do different segments of the cd on different days.  Splitting it up makes it a little more digestable for me.  Cardio mon,wed,fri and the stregnthening exercises tues and thurs and then on sat you're supposed to do the whole cd.

I'd recommend this cd.",1173916800,6,1254,4.723502304147465
2024462,5,B0001US6BO,"I just bought this video (literally the VHS version that comes withOUT the resistance band) & recieved it in the mail & then went out to buy my resistance band which I purchased at walmart for $7, the long version that you can just wrap around your hands to shorten it.

WELL, I must say.. even though I had read the reviews before buying this tape, I had forgotten that it was broken up into segments & so I read the back & it said 25min of cardio, 10 of upper body, 10 lower body & 10 abs, I started the video & followed the workout as best I could, BUT during the cardio I needed to use my inhaler, if you're asthmatic as I am, you may want to have your inhaler handy or take it before you start because the cardio is first & it will get you jumping, your heart will be racing & you will be sweating, trust me you'll feel it.

It then comes to the end where Denise says congratulations .. I THOUGHT I was done.. oooh no, then I saw come up on the screen upperbody.. & I was like.. ""WHAT?!!?"" so from my reaction of thinking I went through the entire video, you can see this is a fantastic workout, I've never sweated when doing a dvd & this time I did.

What I didn't like.. is that unlike in her OTHER dvds she explains the moves when they're being done.. this for the cardio did not happen .. & so I was struggling trying to figure out what I was supposed to be doing & if I was doing it right, meanwhile I'm missing the workout & just resorted to jumping around & trying to mimic what was being done (even though I still got a great workout from that).

Overall, I DEFINITELY recommend this (I am a beginner & this was intense for me)",1171929600,8,1640,4.052469135802469
2024463,4,B0001US6BO,"I've never worked out with this instructor before, but after seeing this video, I would definitely use her again.  I viewed the workout before doing it, and at first, I thought she was a chatterbox, but when I did the workout, her talking really motivated me to keep going.  The video is divided into chapters by the type of workout.  The cardio portion could stand to be a little bit longer, especially if you're trying to burn fat.  The best workouts are the ones for your muscles.  If you're looking for a video to sculpt your bottom half and your arms, this is definitely the right video.  You will see results only after a few runs of the video.  Because this video is really good for muscle toning, it really does boost your metabolism.",1171324800,4,742,4.492537313432836
2024464,5,B0001US6BO,"Item arrived promptly and in promised condition.  A better workout than I ever thought possible.  I used this product for nine months and lost weight and became fit, healthy, and confident.  Awesome!",1168300800,4,199,5.15625
2024465,5,B0001US6BO,"This is the best investment I have made towards losing weight and feeling great. It really truely works. I have tried diet pills, fad diets, everything. But this video shows results within 10 days. I noticed results by the end of the 1st week. I have lost 12 pounds in a couple months. My arms, legs, abs, back are toned. I get complimented on it all the time. The resistance band really works. HONESTLY you should by this video.

  As for the comments on drab setting and music. Here is my recommendation. Do what I do. After you get the hang of the routine and all the moves down. Put the TV on mute and blast your own music to get you pumped. WORKS for me! It will work for you! I lost 5 inches off my waist line.",1151539200,17,716,4.136690647482014
2024466,1,B0001US6BO,"I work out 5 days a week so I would consider myself advanced.  This workout is definitely too easy for someone who is advanced.  There were a number of parts where I thought I was watching a Saturday Night Live skit.  It was very cheesy and the other girls in the video look like robots.  My DVD did not come with a band, which I thought was a real bummer.  The set and the music are boring.  I normally love Denise Austin, but this video was very disappointing.  I would instead recommend Shrink Your Female Fat Zones.",1151280000,6,519,4.288659793814433
2024467,5,B0001US6BO,"This workout is really energizing! It contains a 25 minute cardio routine with 10 minute segments of upper body, lower body and abs. It also contains a free fitness band wich is a thumbs up if you don't have one.

I did found the routines a bit fast at the beginning, but I could catch up after a few tries. The fitness band is handy to tone and give youself some stability while doing the workout. I can't really understand either why this DVD has so many low reviews, but it did work for me. I've been eating healthy and using this DVD along with Shrink your female fat Zones DVD for the last 5 months and now I have lost about 20 pounds, have switched from size 18+ jeans to size 13 jeans and my body has lost most of its jello parts. If you like a fast energizing workout, this DVD is for you.

I really don't mind about denise's voice so I will not comment on that.

For all those who didn't like this workout DVD, I recommend you try it again and don't give up so quickly.",1143676800,18,978,4.109947643979058
2024468,2,B0001US6BO,"I prefer the ""Shrink Your Female Fat Zones"" DVD with the balance ball. I really don't like the resistance strap with this one and I will probably sell my DVD, because I just don't like it. Denise does some great videos, but this isn't among them.",1137024000,6,246,4.369565217391305
2024479,3,B0001US6BO,"I have several of Denise Austin's earlier videos and I liked them a lot.  Denise Austin was the first workout video I ever owned, so I learned a lot from her.

However, this video is frustrating the first couple of times because Denise doesn't cue you in to the upcoming moves.  You REALLY have to count and/or watch closely.  Plus, as someone else mentioned, if you miss the first couple of repetitions, you won't be getting nearly as effective a workout because she generally does only 8 slow reps and then 8 fast ones.  It is over in the blink of an eye!

The workout itself, while probably effective, seems a little ""tired"" and boring to me.  If I wanted to do dance moves, I would have bought a dance workout.  When she throws in the ""chasee"", mambo, and rock-step, it really doesn't fit with the rest of the workout-- much lower energy than the rest of the cardio section.

The use of the ""power-band"" feels fun and effective.  I don't have a power-band, but bought a resistance tube at the store for mere dollars, and it works just as well.

Overall, it IS a good workout, but it isn't one of Denise Austin's best videos.",1136764800,6,1128,4.427184466019417
2024480,1,B0001US6BO,"I don't like her routine in this DVD at all.  I don't like the strechie.  It's a completely waste and it won't give you the same workout as hand weights or balance ball.  I solde the DVD the 2nd day I bought it.  However, I do like her 'Shrink Your Female Fat Zone,' which uses dumbell and balance for upper body, lower body and abs.",1132358400,5,333,4.076923076923077
2024481,4,B0001US6BO,"This is a very fast paced workout.  It took a couple of times through to learn the routine.  Denise doesn't cue all that well.  She's very upbeat and energetic and constantly gives words of encouragement.  Most people don't like that about her, but I think she is motivating.

You definitely work all muscle groups and you'll be sweating with this workout.  I'm tired, but invigorated by the end.

I enjoyed this workout a lot.",1130976000,5,427,4.6891891891891895
2024482,4,B0001US6BO,"A lot of the reviews I have read on here criticse Denise's use of the resistance band in this DVD.  I'll have to say that when I ordered this DVD, I actually wanted the free band more than the DVD itself! *shhhh!  Amazon doesn't ship exercise equipment to New Zealand, and hey, I got a DVD that used it too!*

I love the resistance band because it takes up very little room and lets me perform cardio and toning simultaneously.  I don't find the band awkward at all, and I'm quite surprised by the negative feedback that others have given, but oh well, to each his own.

There are four sections to this DVD, the 25min cardio routine that uses circuit training between short cardio segments and pure toning segments using the band, 10mins of Upper Body toning using the band, 10mins of Lower Body toning using the band and 10mins of Abdominal exercises.  I haven't attempted the abdominal exercises... mainly because it looks as though she doesn't use the band in that section, which I really would have preferred.

I find the Cardio section fun, and I like it how she breaks down the routine into small combos and works on them for a few minutes before moving onto something different.  A lot of people have complained about her cueing - but I have learnt to ignore what she's saying and WATCH THE DARN TV.  The first few times, of course, I'm a bit out of step with her, but this is the case for all exercise DVDs - not just Denise Austin's.

I love the toning segments that use the band - and its especially good for my mother who has occupational overuse syndrome in her arms from writing on a blackboard all day.  Weights are hard on her joints, so the band is ideal for her.  Also, the resistance band is great to fold up and take away when you go somewhere.

If you find resistance bands awkward, don't like Denise Austin and aren't laid back enough to intelligently substitute parts of a workout that you don't like or can't do appropriately or lack the perseverence to try a DVD several times over before coming to a conclusion of its effectiveness, then don't bother buying this DVD.  In fact, don't bother buying any DVD.  Go to the gym.",1130630400,50,2147,4.455242966751918
2024483,5,B0001US6BO,"Effective and fun.  Good use of theraband and easy to follow.  I only do the cardio aspect.  However, the cardio aspect has cardio and strengthening together.  I love this one.  Good use of 30 minutes.",1129939200,10,201,4.628571428571429
2024484,4,B0001US6BO,"This dvd has a lot to offer.  I actually sweat during the workout and she uses the resistance bands which allows me to do something different than the norm.  However, if you are an advanced workout person, you might be bored with this.",1125360000,4,235,4.441860465116279
2024485,3,B0001US6BO,"But not that great either.  There were definite high points and low points to this workout.  The workout itself is pretty good.  She uses the standard staples of most aerobic videos (lunges, squats, mambos, etc...) which is good, because if she used complex choreography no one would be able to follow the video because SHE IS TOTALLY HORRIBLE AT CUEING!!!!! Thus the low point of the workout--she is a complete dingbat.  She can't cue sometimes and the other times, she just doesn't.  Or she'll do a move a few times and THEN say ""Okay, we're doing....now..."" Half the time she'll say ""One more set!"" and end up doing a couple.  And her ""encouragement"" is bordering on cheesy and annoying.  There is no need for all the enthusiasm, because it sounds quite fake and contrived.

Hands down the best part of the workout is the workout band that came with my video.  It totally helped out with the intensity, and worked the arms and shoulders wonderfully.  I would have liked it better if she could do more reps of each exercise, but the pause button on the DVD player solves that problem easily.  All in all, I think I will keep this in my rotation, but I don't think it'll make the weekly cut. And I definitely won't buy anymore of her workouts.",1121731200,,1244,4.558558558558558
2024486,4,B0001US6BO,I enjoy Denise Austin. I have done her Blast 10lbs tape for the past couple of years and found this DVD a fun change. It is a steady workout. It is not to difficult but I enjoyed it. I would of given it 5 stars if the cardio was just a little more intense. This is great for me because I had a baby 12 weeks ago and was not able to exercise during my pregnancy. Doing this and the Blast 10lbs for the past 6 weeks I have lost inches and about 10 lbs. I have been watching what I eat as well but feel these tapes really rev up your metabilism!,1120780800,2,542,3.8053097345132745
2024487,4,B0001US6BO,"I am 22 years old and I'd say I'm pretty much in shape. I eat right and sometimes when my pockets are a bit more full, I will buy organic food. I love fitness!!!! When buying Denise Austin's video, I felt a bit awkward at first using the resistance band.  But after tightening in up a bit and using the 20 minute cardio, the upper body, and the ab workout with my running schedule, I lost 3 pounds in a couple of days! The workout seemed a bit intense at first and I sweated so much, especially when the  pony exercise began. But this tape really works!!! Denise Austin is truly a motivator! She has inspired me to keep working out, smile and know that I am worth it! Sometimes, I feel there isn't enough reps, but according to Denise, it's just the right amount to get a slim body. You have to buy this video! It's truly worth it!!",1120608000,2,832,4.19375
2024488,1,B0001US6BO,"I bought this DVD after seeing Denise Austin appear on many talk shows promoting it.  Big Mistake.......  I found the cardio section barely got my heart rate up and I even found it difficult to follow.  I found that the toning section w/ the bands was extremely awkward.  Something just wasn't right - maybe the band was too short or maybe the band just didn't have enough give to it - I ended up straining my wrists as I was trying to do the moves.  I didn't like anything about this DVD.  This was actually the first workout DVD I got and it almost made me swear off all fitness DVDs.  After a few months, I decided to give DVDs another try, because I was so fed up with working out at the gym.  My next fitness DVD purchase was Tamilee Webb's I want that Body - which turned out to be one of the best out there!  Don't waste your money on this Denise Austin DVD, check out my other reviews - there are some fantastic ones out there!",1116892800,5,935,4.15
2024489,4,B0001US6BO,"This is my very first workout DVD.  I bought it because I do not own any workout equipment, and this DVD came with the only equipment you need.

I like the way she teaches the routines one step at a time... even an exercise ignoramus like me can do most of it.  I have been doing this for three weeks now and I can almost keep up with it. I think if I could do it all the first time, I would be bored by now!  My only problem with the cardio section is that the music is not loud enough.  I work out better to a strong beat (plus it would help to drown out Denise's slightly annoying voice)

The resistance band is not that annoying to me.  It is a little difficult to get the ends wrapped around my hands quickly enough for the kickboxing moves but I am getting better at it every day.  I also have not been using it the way they do in the video... they fold it in half for more resistance, but I leave it full length (for now) because I have my hands full learning the steps.  Once I can do all the steps I will work on using the band right.

The toning segments really work!  I now have muscle aches in places I didn't even know I had muscles!  I can't do a lot of the ab section, but I have been trying and even that is making my abs a lot stronger.

Overall, I think this is a great workout... maybe not the best for beginners, especially if you're easily discouraged, but if you're in decent shape (or an optimist like me) it's definitely worth the money.",1115942400,6,1461,4.013840830449827
2024490,4,B0001US6BO,"This is a great workout for those who are not particularly ""out-of-shape"" but need a way to get into a new fitness routine.  She's quite motivating, and... at first she annoyed me a little, until one day I started mocking her doing the workout... and it actually made the workout easier and much more effective. In other words, be as annoyingly peppy as she is... you'll see results.

It's important for buyers to know how the cardio section works: she builds three or four mini-routines. She shows you different segments of each, then puts them together in a mini-routine, which you do three full times through.  It's really effective. Also, she works at a great pace, going slower and faster to match your needs.

The workout bands allow versatility in your workout. At first, it takes a little practice to manipulate them correctly, but once you get it down, you can actually make your workout harder and easier as you need it, adapting as your level increases. I actually bought a set of newer bands (shorter, yes) but still effective. It allowed me to increase my resistivity.

She doesn't really explain the steps you do, but as you're watching, they're relatively easy to pick up and copy. By the third viewing, my excersize partner and I were doing it smoothly.  Her cues aren't the best, but once you work through the routines, you don't even really need her.

The upper body workout is really nice... short, but nice. Again, you can make it harder by upping your resistivity with the band, or buying stronger bands. The lower body workout really kicks your butt. When she says ""squeeze,"" really squeeze. She's not just being annoying, she's serious. You get a much better workout when you listen to her.  The butt-blaster. Yeah. It blasts your butt.

Ab workout is the only complaint. You NEED upper body strength to complete her ab workout properly. Otherwise, hurting yourself is a possibility. But, she does do different levels of intensity through the ab workout, allowing you to take it easy through the first few times you do it.

All in all, a really good workout... and you can make it a really great workout with a little effort and patience.  Give it a try, and remember to ""mock"" Denise... it works!  WOO HOO!  LIFT!! SQUEEZE!! WOO HOO!",1115596800,6,2257,4.7270408163265305
2024491,4,B0001US6BO,"I am not a huge fan of Denise's chattiness and perkiness, so I don't have a lot of her videos/DVDs, but the few that I have are decent, this one included.

I did it for the first time tonight --  I was sweating by the end of the aerobics section and felt that I had had a workout!  There's a caveat -- this is definitely NOT for a beginner as there are no demonstrations or explanations of the moves, steps or form.  She moves quickly along as if we know exactly what to do -- but guess what?  Because I have so many exercise DVDs, I am already familiar with all of the moves and what it takes to have good form!  With no demo moves and explanations, the workout gives you the feel of being in a class in the gym!  I like this because once I've gotten a DVD exercise routine down, the existence of the demo moves annoy me.  Bonus:  Denise doesn't chatter much or encourage you along, again, it gives the feel of being in a class at the gym.

Beginners beware, it may take you a while to get the steps down and to follow Denise's quick cueing; which may discourage you and cause you to give up",1114646400,10,1092,4.084507042253521
2024492,4,B0001US6BO,"I think this is a great workout - I love using the band that the dvd comes with.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I did not find it a nuisance at all, it was a nice change to help tone the upper body while performing the aerobics (which, by the way, makes me work up quite a sweat!!) I feel great afterwards... I would highly recommend this dvd if you are trying to work some cardio into your schedule, or if you are bored with the ones you have!",1114128000,2,450,4.0
2024493,4,B0001US6BO,"It was something different. I like using a resistance band with the aerobics. I found this workout to be a lot of fun. But you know Denise, she's upbeat, positive, her cuing is not great, but she is friendly and encouraging! I sweat a lot when doing the cardio part, and I feel GREAT afterwards. I think it was a very good total body workout. I have a lot of exercise videos in my collection, but I return to this one often because it is so much fun.",1111795200,8,450,4.125
2024494,1,B0001US6BO,"I am disappointed with the cardio section of this workout.  I have done her Pilates video and enjoyed it, but on this one, she doesn't explain the dance steps.  She calls the name of the steps and gets right into them.  Other videos with other instructors either do the step slowly first or they explain it at the beginning of the video.

For someone with little to no dance experience, the box step, mambo, sashay step, and others will be hard to follow.  I've done the DVD twice and still can't get it right.  I just jumped around while they did the steps.  She doesn't give good cues as to what is next.

Also, the band broke the second time I used the video!  I bought a set of 3 bands at another store (for the same price as one of Denise's bands), but they are not long enough to do the toning exercises properly.",1111622400,6,819,4.232258064516129
2024495,2,B0001US6BO,"I did this video only two times. I felt like I got a good workout in the 25 min cardio section, but I could not follow along with the steps so I lost interest. On the upper and lower body workouts, she does not give enough time to adjust the resistance band before she starts the exercise, and other exercises it seems like the resistance band was not long enough to perform it correctly and I could barely move the band (or it could be that it was too much resistance for me.) I think it would be better done with hand weights instead of the band, but the cardio is good if you can keep up with the steps.",1109980800,5,606,4.058333333333334
2024496,2,B0001US6BO,"I typically really enjoy Denise Austin's workouts, but this one was very easy, and didn't provide even a moderate intensity workout.

2024497,1,B0001US6BO,"this was the worst workout video ever. I will never buy a Denise Austin video again. There is barely a warm up and NO cool down, which leaves you with a high heart rate. Terrible. And the cardio was VERY hard to follow. The upper body toning exercises were pretty good, but thats the only segment that was decent. Its a total waste of money. I will just stick to Leslie Sansone.",1105833600,8,378,4.263888888888889

The only thing negative is that her back up girls seem to be doing this against their will.",1104364800,10,348,4.369230769230769
2024509,2,B0001US6BO,"I like Denise Austin in the first Power Zone DVD, so I was eager to go and purchase this one. What a huge let down this one was. Her cuing was horrible, and the workout itself was uninspiring. I also didn't feel like she used the power band as effectively as she could have. In other words, save your money on this one.",1103760000,5,319,4.079365079365079
2024510,1,B0001US6BO,"I have a lot of exercise videos in my collection and wanted to add a new one to ""mix it up"". Unfortunately, this ones a loser. It stars with aerobics and you have to use the ""included fitness band"", which is just a long piece of cheap rubber that gets sweaty!! I found the band to be awkward to use and it's also too long, causing you to have to wrap it around your fists and try to keep it in the same place as the girls on the video.  If you don't have just the right amount of tension in the band, you aren't really doing anything for your muscles.  It was just a nuisance. And the aerobics only last for about 15 minutes (not the 25 minutes that it claims to be).  There were no new moves I haven't done a million times in the cardio section and again, the rubber band is more a hindrance than a help.  Then it goes on to 10 minutes of upper body work-again, using the stupid rubber band. These exercises are easier to do with light weights and I found this to be nothing but a waste of my time.  Perhaps it would work if you had plenty of time to get just the right amount of tension in your band, but you aren't given that time.  Then it's on to 10 minutes of lower body work, which is nothing but lunges and squats using the band...nothing new or good here.  Lastly is ab work (finally something without the stupid band!!!) but none of the repetitions in the ab section are enough to really get your stomach burning.  Just when you start to maybe feel it, Denise has you stop.  There were a few interesting ab moves done, different than the usual, but you would have to do at least twice or three times as many reps as Denise does to get any benefit or feel the burn.  She also throws in a few Pilates moves for the tummy, but I have other Pilates videos so this was nothing new.

Overall, I wasn't annoyed by Denise's talking, as many other reviewers seem to be.  I was mostly annoyed with trying to get that band in the right place with the right tension to benefit my muscles, and, even if you succeed there, the segments are just too short to do much good.",1098921600,23,2067,4.127182044887781

I have used this at least twice a week since the day it came out, and I can see amazing results, especially from the toning part of the DVD.  For once she has people working out with her that don't look like zombies, and it makes the workout more enjoyable.  I sweat a lot when doing the cardio part, and I feel GREAT afterwards.  My metabolism is definitely starting to improve. She's not as obnoxious in this video, which is nice, and she really keeps you moving and burning fat.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who likes to get a quick workout in the morning before work to get them pumped up through out the day, or before bed for an amazing sleep, or to anyone who enjoys working out with Denise.",1091491200,19,776,4.216216216216216
2024513,4,B0001US6BO,"Taking the intensity up a notch was something I really wanted to accomplish after I finished working out to the same workouts that Denise Austin did everyday on Lifetime TV. Her new video, ""Power Zone: The Ultimate Metabolism Boosting Workout"" has done just that. Using resistance bands during the whole workout, Denise brings the intensity up efficiently and effectively....enough that I was sweating in less than 10 minutes into the workout! During the entire 25 minutes of cardio, you're burning OVER 300 calories! I am serious - with the resistence band, fat gets a powerful punch!
Denise has you do 25 minutes of cardio, then 10 minute segments each for your legs, thighs, buttocks, and abdominals. After working out with Denise for over two years, I have to say that this workout is the best and most effective that I ever used. Although, I do have my disappointments in this one. I noticed that Denise seemed hurried and uninterested in the workout in some points of the video. The moves are quick and fast-paced and if you are doing the workout for the first time, you may feel like you're not able to keep up. Of course, you will get used to the moves in time - after the first workout I got used to it, so it's not something tremendously serious that you need to think over. Denise's workout mates on the video can annoy you enormously if you let them - they seem like they're in a trance during the whole workout and look more like fake supermodels than workout mates (you notice in many exercise videos that workout mates seem more tolerable and real - like mothers who workout or someone from the street who is fit.. but these women on this workout video seem like they have fake personalities).
Other than that, the workout is great - you definitely feel like your muscles were worked hard enough and that you had a real, complete workout.
Recommended fitness levels are at least intermediate. You need to have at least SOME exercise experience - if you are just starting out, I would recommend Denise Austin's Xtralite Exercise videos that are available at Amazon instead.",1090022400,18,2087,4.704918032786885

2024515,1,B0001US6BO,Denise Austin has got to be the most annoying and condescending instructor around. I think she doesn't realized or understand how annoying and condescending she is.

I feel like I'm constantly readjusting it which distracts me from the workout.  Also, if you have any shoulder problems, the band and this workout seems to aggravate it.

I own about 5 workout DVDs including ones from Jillian Michaels and Prevention, but I like Austin because she keeps things simple for unbelieveably uncoordinated people like me and it's very effective because she emphasises balance , flexibility and power not just strength and cardio.
Having said that...
The moves in this one were a little complicated for my taste. The first time was uuuuugly, but I persevered and about my third time doing the video, I finally got all the mamboing and sashaying nonsense.  I love her Ultimate Fat Burner. It's simpler, but more intense.
Speaking of intensity, I can jog a casual kilometre without much trouble, lift about 130% of my bodyweight off the ground and do 7 good pushups.  I did the video from beginning to end and I didn't really get winded, but my heartrate was up and I was a little flushed. I think this video is good for beginners who want a well-rounded fitness programme video and for moderate to advanced exercisers on recovery days since it's great for balance.  It has a little dance, pilates, resistance training, and strength and power work.
As for the bands, I like them a lot.  It helps with balance and stabilisation and is cheaper and more accessible than weights and who cares if you drop a band on your foot or hardwood floor?
All-in-all, not low-impact but worth doing because",1364774400,,1490,4.650190114068441
