5852092,5,B00DS79H1U,This movie will keep you thinking for days to come. There is a lot wrapped into the story line and I could feel my heart beating in my chest as I anxiously awaited what was going to happen next. A thriller by far!,1381881600,6,213,3.9767441860465116
5852093,5,B00DS79H1U,Just finished watching this movie and Una Jo had me from the beginning with her drug addicted and trashy character. Great story line with an amazing twist I would have NEVER seen coming! A must see and a great addition to anyone's home library.,1381795200,4,244,4.568181818181818

5852128,3,B00DS79H1U,At first the acting didn't really seem all that good. I guess most of us have known someone who has been affected by drugs and it's very ugly. Several times I thought of turning it off because it was so strange but I kept watching and glad I did. The end gave me chills. It makes you think.,1453248000,,290,4.017241379310345

5852131,5,B00DS79H1U,"This was a very good movie. Never heard of it before but thought I'd see if the reviews were right (the positives) and it didn't disappoint. In the beginning I wasn't quite sure if I was going to like it, but then it pulled me in. Very very unique ending!!",1451865600,,256,4.14
5852132,5,B00DS79H1U,"I had to watch the last 10 minutes of this movie over again, thinking to myself ""are you serious!""",1450828800,,98,4.2105263157894735
5852133,5,B00DS79H1U,Oh man! This was a good movie! I was like a tennis ball all over the place trying to figure it out. Talk about tough love! This film actually had me in tears at the end! I truly believe this would actually work as long as their are sufficient safe guards in place.,1450137600,,264,4.0
5852154,5,B00DS79H1U,Those 5 stars were for the ending.  Amazing.  Glad I didn't give up on this one.,1449964800,,80,3.9375
5852155,4,B00DS79H1U,"An average movie to begin with, but if you watch it till the end it will certainly impress you. I've seen a lot of twists at the end of movies but this one is brilliant, you would never guess. It completes the movie in a very thought-provoking way. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who can relate to (or even if you can't relate) addicts. It has some great life lessons in it for everyone - not something you always get out of movies like this. The acting is decent too. Would have been great to see some big names in a movie like this, it certainly has the story line that could pull a Charlize Theron or Jessica Biel (if you haven't already, watch The Tall Man for one of Biel's best performances).",1448496000,,717,4.279411764705882
5852156,2,B00DS79H1U,"When it comes to movies, I almost always keep my opinions to myself. I tend to stick to horror/suspense, which means I've come to terms with the fact that for every movie I'm impressed by, I will sift through four I hated. It just comes with the territory. And it when it comes to using reviews to weigh whether I should watch something, I skip over any comment focused on things like camera quality, how skilled the actors are, etc. Yes, they're key factors, but a movie's intrinsic value isn't solely determined that way (in my opinion.) I can forgive a little poorly-written dialogue if I'm impressed enough by the story.
HOWEVER. After watching this movie, I was so turned off, I feel like I have to give warning to any like-minded potential viewers. Everything prior to the last six minutes would have left us on good terms. The pace kept my interest, the main character was complex enough to root for, and I was especially impressed by the serial killer's convincing acting.
BUT THEN.
The movie turned on me. Without any given warning, I realized I was tricked into watching a movie written by the the church who introduced us to ""The Christian Side Hug."" The last time I felt like this was when I visited what I thought was a Halloween hell house only to be surrounded the B-cast of 7th Heaven and asked if I knew about Satan and his penchant for making me sin.
Look Amazon, I didn't come here to learn any life lessons or contemplate where bad folks go when they die. Unless there's a priest with a collection of homemade snuff films, I want God nowhere in my movie. I roll my eyes at torture porn and abundant gore just as much as the next guy, but I find impromptu sermons just as off-putting.
I'm not saying everyone should feel violated by it. But for those of you that would appreciate the warning, someone gave Joel Osteen permission to try his hand at horror writing- and this is the result.",1448064000,2,1906,4.495677233429395

5852163,5,B00DS79H1U,"Gotta love Michael Madsen, featured in Reservoir Dogs, Getaway, don't give any credence to prior review said it looked like ""Blair Witch Project"" clone, flick  has graphic parts even I cringed.
The lead actress did director duty also?  A female Tom Hanks.",1444953600,,255,5.0476190476190474

5852168,4,B00DS79H1U,"A great independent psychological thriller. Terrible Angels impressively builds suspense continuously throughout the film without ever letting up thanks to great writing, acting, and sound design. This film makes your skin crawl, heart race, and teeth grind until the final moments of the film; which I must say did not meet the expectations the rest of this film set. Overall this is a very creative and effective horror/thriller film that deserves more than one viewing.",1441152000,,472,5.306666666666667
5852169,5,B00DS79H1U,"This film was incredibly surprising, and really reflects on the lengths which those will go to help the ones they loved.  I certainly do not want to give anything away, but the ending was incredibly touching, and anyone who has been in that situation will understand it.  Yeah, there are some amateurish aspects to the film, but it is truly an original.  Well done!!!",1441065600,,367,4.703125
5852170,5,B00DS79H1U,"A great story. Justice was justice.  If you enjoy suspense and mystery and awesome acting this is a treasure. No spoilers here, even if there were something in the movie to spoil. Just watch it, feel it and wonder if you yourself have the capacity to change for the better. If you think you do, don't wait a second, start right now. From my own personal experience I tell you do it now. If you're alone, no friends, no family and no one who cares, specifically yourself. Deep inside of you there is a soul or call it heart, the terminology doesn't matter, but that part wants to live. Dig into that part, do whatever it takes to make people, strangers, those in the medical field or anyone notice you're hurt and broken and that you don't really care. If you keep trying to get someone to notice, a good someone. Someone who enjoys giving instead of taking will see you. It's a long journey from  hell to heaven, it's a hard one, it's exhausting and painful. But the road is there, why stay in Hell any longer than you have to. Jump on that path and go.",1440979200,,1053,4.313131313131313
5852171,2,B00DS79H1U,Very slow-moving.  Very boring.  Stopped watching less than 1/2 way through.,1440720000,,76,5.818181818181818

5852173,3,B00DS79H1U,"If I could I would probably give this a 2.5. I mean it's a well played movie that leaves you feeling pretty satisfied, but a little less satisfied with how fantastic it is on the second day. It's like someone you meet in a bar and he or she under the glow of the ligthts and with the music and the booze seems perfect, but you wake up the next day and everything is a little less so.",1440374400,,383,3.923076923076923
5852174,3,B00DS79H1U,"Ok I am very confused about the ending therefore hard to get a good rating from me. I had to search the net to understand the ending and I think I am pretty good at predicting the endings of movies.  I think the ending should have been a bit more clear for me to have it make a huge impact.  I thought that it could have been what the ending was about, however, I would like to have seen more put into the end.  Like how did she find out what it was about? What role did the psycholigist play?  Did he know what was happening?  I waited for the police to come but that didn't happen.  So for me it left me with to much wonder.  I did find out what the end was about reading online.  Just my thoughts.",1440028800,,700,3.9148936170212765

5852180,1,B00DS79H1U,Horrible.  I turned it off about 20 minutes into it.  Can't believe I wasted $2.99 on this movie.,1438646400,,97,4.333333333333333
5852181,5,B00DS79H1U,"I really liked this movie. It was a bit slow, and somewhat confusing as to where the plot was headed in the beginning. However, it didn't take long for the plot to begin to become a bit more understandable. I do like to watch Michael Madsen movies. Even though his part in this movie was a bit limited, it is still a very good movie. Expect a very interesting plot twist towards end of movie. I was shocked and impressed by this twist. I see myself watching this many times. You must watch it to the end...... :-)",1438300800,,513,4.244897959183674
5852182,4,B00DS79H1U,"What an ending! I mean I had a small idea it might be something like that but wow. It starts slow and builds throughout. Stick with it, it's a pretty good story.",1437436800,,161,4.0625

5852185,5,B00DS79H1U,"When I chose this movie to watch, it was basically because of Madson. He has that look, which lends credibility to the ""story"" line. After  watching it for an hour, i got over the captives perfect teeth, their ability to tell time, how they were supposed to eat, drink, eliminate, etc. and i rode with it. The ending was masterful. All of my ""distrust"" of ""how could this happen"" for so long, so many hostages, etc. The ending CLEARED that up immediately!!! Anyone who is wavering on deciding to watch TERRIBLE ANGELS should give it a view!!!!! It took me awhile to actually absorb the brilliance of how this played out and I watched the ending about 5 times!!!!!! It is a great flick!",1436659200,,685,4.524193548387097
5852186,5,B00DS79H1U,"I'm sure friends and family of addicts wonder what it will take to save someone before they manage to get themselves killed.  You watch the destruction and there is nothing you can do.  I feel Una Jo Blade played this character quite well.  Addicts will yes you to death w/ fake sincerity while they look for the next fix.  She has made all the mistakes - addict, drug dealer, prostitute, but is also a mother to 2 who I believed loved her kids but I also believed she might trade them to someone for the next hit if necessary..  This is how far she has fallen.

As she descends down this dead end life, she sees an opportunity to get cash for turning a trick and gets in a truck with this guy.
The next hour was scary and riveting in a slow motion physically non-violent way.  But there are lots of kinds of violence and abuse and you don't question for a minute the danger she is in.  By the time the movie was winding down I was on the edge of my seat and then screaming at the TV because no one believed her story.
I was not happy with what was happening, so I guess by that time I cared about her, and time is going by - what about the others left behind??

Then the ending.  Oh, boy!!!  I haven't been this surprised since The Crying Game.  I understood so much more about what was said during her abduction.  The possibilities, the danger - It could never happen, but what if it did?

This is a nice little film and I'm glad Michael Madsen agreed to participate.  I don't know if he was friends with the writer-director (Anthony Pierce) or producer (Una Jo Blade serving double duty), or was trying to help give this movie a boost that only a well known actor can do sometimes, but I'm glad this low budget gem caught my eye.  I'd also like to see more from Pierce and Blade (and will be able to once 'The Gnashing' is complete - as long as it is not real gore this time!).",1436140800,4,1880,4.166204986149585
5852187,4,B00DS79H1U,"Pretty good; I did sort of figure it out partway through, but it was a bit more of a mystery than the average movie these days! Good idea, too! Get past the initial few minutes that appear to be low quality; it gets better! (I can't decide if this was due to it being low-budget, and they just didn't film those scenes as well, or if it's an artistic touch to show better quality visuals with better quality life of the character.)",1432771200,,431,4.2682926829268295
5852188,5,B00DS79H1U,Wonderful movie. I agree it was slow to begin but what a twist!! Enjoyed this movie!! Definite watch!!,1432425600,,102,4.722222222222222
5852189,2,B00DS79H1U,"It was slow to begin with and then went to hell at the end. I didn't find the twist to be anything but awful. SPOILER!!!!!!! Any decent law enforcement agency would have followed up on her claim and once they figured out what really happened all the players would be sent to prison for a good amount of time. Stupid, sick and twisted. Watch the last 6 minutes and save youself a lot of wasted time.",1430265600,,398,4.25
5852190,3,B00DS79H1U,"I took a chance on this movie based on other reviews (mind you I have dine so before and been quite disappointed) and I must say that it is actually a decent little film.

5852191,5,B00DS79H1U,"I'm gonna give it 5 stars. If it had a Hollywood budget, maybe 4, but this movie held together.

5852198,3,B00DS79H1U,"Not a bad movie.  The ending was not too surprising for me because I 1/2 suspected something like that was going on because of the statement by the cop ""Did you actually see it?""
The music was not the best and at some points made the movie appear too cheesy.  They should have reconsidered that point.",1424476800,,301,4.357142857142857

It works not because of 'non-stop action' or blood and gore (there really is none) but because you just want to know 'what happens next.'  You will care about Linda (wonderfully played by Una Jo Blade) and you will care about the outcome for the other people caught in this horrific situation.  You also will want to know the backstory of the bad guy.  Watch it 'til the end, and you will know all - and be recommending this flick to your friends.

The acting was not believable, the story line was far fetched, there was no plot, the ending was not a twist nor was any part of it enjoyable.  Major faux pas...she had a shovel to release herself or kill her captor & threw it away, literally on many occasion..Not a good film in any sense of the word.  And certainly not a horror film.

5852202,4,B00DS79H1U,"The ending was awesome and completely unexpected. There is a powerful message here about how our selfishness and capacity to take things for granted leads to crushing regret. Poor choices lead a young junkie mother to a horrendous situation that changes her big time. Really, really amazing plot twist. Recommended.",1422057600,,315,5.32
5852203,5,B00DS79H1U,"Whoa! Awesome film. A little slow going in the beginning, and you think it's another B streaming piece of junk, then it gets going and sweeps you along 'till the twist ending, although I have to say that I actually could see how the main gal there was changing for the better and did indeed suspect the ""bad guy"" of having something up his sleeve other than the obvious. I thought the acting was pretty good myself, I don't know what people think should have been better about it, if anything, Michael Madsen was the weak spot, but then he is always cast a certain way, and he fit his spot here well. Una Jo Blade was perfectly cast in her role, and did a great job IMHO. I would not be surprised to see more of her in the future. She carried the film. Somebody complained about character development, and I think the first 15 minutes or so was what that was all about. It was slow, because we see it all the time in films; the selfish junkie woman, terrible mother, creepy associates, part time hooker, trouble with the police for dealing, etc. You get a clear picture of her as a stereotypical junkie, you know who she is.

5852204,5,B00DS79H1U,"Terrible Angel turned out to be terribly good.  Iwas pleasantly suprised by this movie, I guess it's what you would call a sleeper.  One of those movies that you would ordinarily over-look.  It starts off as a typical bad-mother gone wrong doing drugs,sellings drugs, as well as herself...She ends up losing her two children and going to jail.  This is where the story starts to get good.  She tries to convince her jailers, that she had been kidnapped and tortured, thus missing her court dated, which led to her incarceration.  The details of her story is shown i n flasbacks, and it is up to us to decipher what's real or not. The best part of this is the ending, you just don,t see it coming,  To say anymore would ruin it, so take a look when you get a chance, it's worth the watch.",1421798400,,787,4.386206896551724

5852206,4,B00DS79H1U,"Excellent independent film. Contrary to some of the other reviewers, I thought the actors were talented and believable in demanding roles. Also, they were well cast.  Even w/o the twist it's a good story, and I can see how that wraps it up after the point was made -- but I don't see that as the point. (Minus 1 for showing barfing).",1421798400,,333,4.370967741935484
5852207,5,B00DS79H1U,"I've watch a lot of movies and I can honestly say that this is one of the best I've seen.  I especially enjoyed the presence of Michael Madsen.  While his role was secondary to the story, he added an intensity that might have been missing otherwise.  Madsen played a detective investigating the story of a junkie named Linda who is in prison for drug dealing and for neglecting her two young children.  Linda claims she missed her court date because she was kidnapped and held captive for two months.  But her incredible story doesn't stop there.  She also claims she was surrounded by several other captives who were buried in coffins, but who could be communicated with through tubes drilled into the coffins.  Much of the story is told in flashback, as Linda recounts her terrifying experiences to the detective.  The most powerful aspect of ""Terrible Angels"" is the transformation that occurs in the Linda's character.  She was far from likable at first, but I grew to care about her and root for her as she tried to escape and rescue another captive.  I have shown this movie to a couple of my friends since watching it, and each had a different impression of it.

If you have read any of the reviews, you certainly know that it has quite a twist, which you have to watch the whole movie to get. This movie is well acted, especially by the woman which plays Linda, working in a career myself, which revolves around helping addicts find sobriety, I can say that the actress has gotten much of the mentality of ""addict brain"" down well. Now I'm not saying that all addicts do or act like she has. But the power of the addiction is very very overwhelming! I am not an addict myself, only a recovery smoker. But if you are not in recovery, and would like to have an idea of what it feels like to go through withdrawal, and the utter drive to use can be like. Do this simple experiment, Don't drink anything for a whole day, heck go as long as you possibly can without putting yourself in danger. But when it gets to that point where you are just dieing for a glass of water. Look at that glass of water as the drug someone in the throws of addiction or even in recovery may or is slave too. Now accept the fact you cannot under any circumstances have that glass of water. When you have done this, and experienced the undeniable pull to drink something and all the excuses that you come up with as to why you can. Than you have a bit of an idea what it feels like to have to overcome addiction. Well, that's it for my soap box, this is a pretty damn good movie! Worth a watch, and if you have ever suffered from addiction or know someone who has, worth a watch for the top notch acting from the protagonist.",1417392000,,1695,4.2024539877300615

5852255,2,B00DS79H1U,"I gave this movie two stars overall, which is probably one too many...

Maybe it's because I am old and don't like to waste time, or maybe it's because I watch too much TV and movies, and read too many books. I saw through the ""plot"" and figured out the so-called ""twist"" in the story about half way through. In my opinion, there was no story before then. The acting deserves three stars, which is a rounded up average between Michael Madson (one star) and Una Jo Blade (four stars).

The plot focuses on a young female drug addict and prostitute who is drugged and kidnapped by a stranger. She is held hostage for no apparent purpose. From that point on it is like a re-hash of an earlier Criminal  Minds story, except there is no tension or sympathy for any character.

I normally watch any movie with Madsen, and will continue to do so. But, in this flick he acted like he just stopped by to pick up a small paycheck. I kept getting dizzy holding my breath waiting for Madsen to do something cool, or kick some butt.  He sat there like acting more like a college consular than a cop.",1411430400,,1086,4.330049261083744

5852292,5,B00DS79H1U,"I watched and waited, the building 'drama', intrigue, and mystery was just starting to wear a bit thin when the bits and pieces woven throughout came together (pretty much) with an ending that I never saw coming - but was believable and not just pulled out of someones back pocket (you know, the one in the center of the back of their pants) for some ""surprise"" ending.  I then called several people I know and told them they just had to watch this movie.

The movie weaves in and out of showing background and flashback, building in a logical progression.  The main character is a single women with two children, she is struggling with inner city poverty, drugs (use and a selling con), bad relationships, health, and the legal system.  Rest easy, not to much time is spent on this background though it is a major segment which you continue to get glimpses of as the story unwinds.

She gets abducted by an older man, ironically named ""Justice"" and is forced into a new survival game, one where she has to actively participate for not just her life but the life of others who have also been abducted - all with some sin (perceived or otherwise) that they have to answer for.  The other half of the story is her telling her story of abduction and the events that occurred to social case worker who has to decide if she is crazy, or guilty of murder.  As she is alive and in the hospital you already know that she somehow has escaped, but how is the question the movie builds on.

The other unfortunates that are being held have somehow passed into the second phase of their punishment by Mr. Justice - having passed out of his favor and into little holding coffins in covered graves - a large pipe acting as the breathing tube which also serves as the way to talk back and forth as well as be provided food and water.  Their stories are given, their pleas heard, their fates decided as a part of the plot but not a lot of details or flashbacks.

Overall this is a well thought out script, the dialog is very believable, the conclusion you will not see coming.  Caution - when you think the movie has ended (it is at a logical point) the screen goes dark for just a few seconds but do not stop watching as their is just a few minutes left that suddenly opens an entirely new plot twist.

For the ""logic"" buffs, some questions from within the movie are not answered in a nice tidy package, nor should they be, though none are important enough to take away from the plot - just enough to keep you wondering.  The ""end"" tosses in some additional questions but not as distractions - more toward making you think up intricate mind explorations on your own.

The story is told as flashbacks, explanations of her circumstances with wrap-around interviews, and I was most of the way through the film before I realized that her sanity was being questioned by her interviewer.  I THINK the director was trying to draw a parallel between the main character's imprisonment and her abduction, but to be quite frank I got bored and stopped paying attention.

How is kidnapping and torturing someone going to convince them to stop doing drugs? People are addicts because they use drugs to numb the horrible pain they feel from the traumatic things they've endured in their lives. If anything she would have done MORE DRUGS after this traumatizing ordeal. The uplifting music during the showing of this ""program"" makes it look like the movie is endorsing this type of thing and thinks it's the best idea ever.

In short; I don't believe in boot camps for teenagers nor do I believe in the unlawful kidnapping of adults who are then forced into an unbelievably sadistic situations against their will.

I rewatched the end four times and scoured the internet for spoilers and found none until I found these comments. Why is ""Justice"" shown in a picture that looks like a courtroom with an American flag? Why did the detective not follow up on Linda's account if three other women gave the same bizarre account of treatment? Linda knew names, descriptions of people, knew the place was 30 minutes away from the hospital so a search radius could have been set up unless we are expected to believe the cops, the hospital, the government==EVERYONE in this stinking movie is in on an unorthodox drug treatment program? Seriously? Linda was an adult so whether her Dad wanted her to go through this or not, Justice is still guilty of kidnapping. This movie should have every copy burned and the people involved in it should NEVER be allowed to work again. A totally disgusting, unbelievable waste of time. I've lost hours of my life I will never get back watching and looking up what this crap meant. Is there a rating below 1?

The story is told as a flashback to a detective (Michael Madsen). Linda is in prison, so we know she escapes. It is a film that holds your interest, but is only mildly entertaining.

I saw the movie using Amazon Prime (think I paid like $3.99) and I'm not mad or anything, or wanting my time or money back.  Sure, it wasn't GOOD, but the idea, anyway, was indeed INTERESTING.  It's fairly slow moving without much in the way of character development, but the idea is worth AT LEAST the three stars I gave it.

The film begins with her incarcerated for crimes we are not sure of and then flashes back to allow us to understand why and how she ended up the way she did.

The biggest problem I had with the film was the character development.  At no time did I ever have any feelings, good or bad, for the female lead.  This made me feel somewhat apathetic to the dilemma she finds herself in.  I believe if her character had been more developed and complex it would have dramatically increased my involvement in her outcome.

I believe, since I have never heard of the director and most of the cast, with the exception of Michael Masdsen, that this was made by a group of novice individuals.  I found it to be somewhat entertaining and I feel with more experience the director and the main actress can have a good future in films.  This film is only mediocre to good and not deserving of the extremely high praise given to it by the three previous reviewers.",1382313600,32,1305,4.422594142259414
5852361,5,B00DS79H1U,Great movie with twists and turns from the beginning until the last second.  Had me in suspense most of the movie and made me really think at the end.  Great plot with very convincing acting.  Will most likely watch it again tomorrow to catch some things I didn't really catch the first time because I had my eyes closed.,1382140800,,321,4.406779661016949
