7885941,3,6305240965,"Yes, its all been done before, but that is exactly what one expects of a minor (or B)  picture. If what fits your time/mood schedule is a routine picture with the kind of action one would find in a low budget, made for television time-filler, this may well fit the bill. Doubt if you would want to pay the four dollar plus a few cents to get it via this website, but for a few cents more you can get it with three other minor movies from Amazon. See: Disaster Collector's Set V.3 (2010).
I would not recommend this one as the core of an evening's entertainment; it is suitable for a later in the evening movie, which you would not mind stopping when not completed, to finish another day in an odd  time slot. It is also a good one to read  a paper to or rest up without worrying about falling asleep in the middle.",1375142400,,814,4.171974522292993
7885942,2,6305240965,"The ubiquitous director Jim Wynorski is back with another prefab, lackadaisical entry.  Daniel Baldwin stars as a crack special operative called upon to ring in a renegade agent played listlessly by Richard Tyson.  Tyson is in possession of Pandora, some kind of weapon of mass destruction which can be used in restricted areas, kill the people but leave everything else intact.  It never says exactly how it kills anyone, but the writers must have thought that unimportant.  At any rate, nothing surprising happens, and the supporting players, including Steve Franken, Tony Todd and even Erika Eleniak are wasted in poorly written roles.  The climax is pretty lame considering Baldwin's character was never told how the Pandora device works but he uses it like it was an old friend.  Tired, been there done that before movie.",1111708800,2,826,5.0814814814814815
