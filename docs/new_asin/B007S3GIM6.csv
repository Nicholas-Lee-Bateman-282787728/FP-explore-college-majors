5109633,5,B007S3GIM6,"87th Precinct is a great series. The 4 main actors (Robert Lansing, Norman Fell, Ron Harper and Gregory Walcott) are great and work well together. Guest stars are a suprise and to see them so young takes you back to simpler times. A must see for Robert Lansing fans. I wish there was more than 1 season.",1343779200,9,303,4.333333333333333
5109634,5,B007S3GIM6,"This box set is so wonderful. It was made before I was born and when it came out I had to have
it because it had Robert Lansing in it. All the actors where great but Robert has been a favorite
of mine for years. If you like older tv shows or movies I would recommend 87th Precinct. It also
has actors that we see today that are older and they show just how good they where back in 1962.

5109635,4,B007S3GIM6,"NBC-TV's 87TH PRECINCT's one-season run may have been the result of having to compete against CBS's THE DANNY THOMAS SHOW and its spinoff, THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW. Thirty episodes of ""87th"" aired between 9/25/61 and 4/30/62. Reruns continued until September and then it vanished, seemingly forever. This DVD release of such an obscurity is quite astonishing, and it gives us TV cop show fans a chance to see what might've been: a long, successful run, if only...

Based on the novels of Evan Hunter (aka Ed McBain), the precinct is located in an area of a fictional town that's much like Manhattan. Regular cast members: Robert Lansing (Det. Steve Carella), Ron Harper (Det. Bert Kling), Norman Fell (Det. Meyer Meyer) and Gregory Walcott (Det. Roger Havilland).

5109637,5,B007S3GIM6,"Wow ! where did this cum from? I scour the Timelessvideo site almost every week in the hope of news of another release and today right here opn amazon, I have discovered two titles not even mentioned on their website! Im not complaining but watch the heart buddy. heh heh heh. This and Yancy Derringer both of which I will purchase very very soon. Wot I have seen of this show on youtube I personally cant wait to own the box set. Robert Lansing is cool. Bring it on Timeless. Coronado 9 was a dream for me,as was State Trooper but this is the bees knees. Thanks guys. More?????? Yep wot about Robert Taylors Detectives? Now there is a beast waiting to be restored or  lets have The Rebel or the Loner. Bring it on.... a delighted collector.",1337212800,7,741,4.369565217391305
5109638,5,B007S3GIM6,"I was happy to read about the upcoming release of the ""87th. Precinct"" tv series, one of the many outstanding b/w, noirish police dramas from that period.  This well-done series was based on the series of books by ""Ed McBain,"" the pseudonym of novelist/screenwriter Evan Hunter.  (I met McBain/Hunter at a signing for a new 87th. Precinct novel years ago.  I don't think most of the people there knew of the writer's double-identity.  While most asked him about the new book, I asked him why the birds attacked Bodega Bay, since Hunter was the screenwriter for my favorite Hitchcock film: ""The Birds""  He seemed amused by my question.)
87th. Precinct ran for one season, (1961-1962,) Monday nights at 9 on NBC.  It was prematurely cancelled by NBC the same day as the show that followed it: the classic Boris Karloff-hosted suspense drama: ""Thriller.""  Too bad, as they were two excellent series.
87th Precinct had an excellent cast that went on to bigger things.  Three years later the star, Robert Lansing, gave one of tv's great performances in the first season of the magnificent World War II drama: ""12 O'Clock High."" (Lansing was let go by producer Quinn Martin after the first season and viewers were told that his character, General Frank Savage had been shot down.)  Co-starring as Lansing's wife was Gena Rowlands who went onto a thriving film career including an Academy Award nomination.  The rest of the police squad were Norman Fell, (later ""Mr Roper"" of ""Threes Company,) Ron Harper( who later starred in the World War II ""Dirty Dozen"" ripoff ""Garrisons Gorillas"" and the quickly cancelled ""Planet of the Apes"" tv series,) and Gregory Walcott, immortalized as the hero of Ed Wood Jr's ""Plan Nine of Outer Space,"" considered by many to be the worst film ever made. (Walcott starred in this before 87th. Precinct.)
Considering Timeless Video's checkered history of quality on these classic series, I hope that this set is of the caliber of another one season, outstanding NBC series ""Wide Country.""  I have gotten through at least half of the episodes on that set and the quality has been quite good (unlike the very disappointing quality of the ""Checkmate"" set, one of my favorite series of all-time but a set very difficult to watch and enjoy due to the mediocre quality and poor editing of many scenes.)
In conclusion, 87th. Precinct was a quality dramatic series, the type we rarely see anymore.  I look forward to purchasing this set when it is released.",1335571200,45,2472,4.873508353221957

5109649,4,B007S3GIM6,"One of those series that was great TV drama but ultimately was left to die in the ratings against much lighter fare. A situation that repeated then and repeats itself today. Robert Lansing, Norman Fell, Gregory Walcott and Ron Harper were the detectives, their characters based on novelist Ed McBain's concept of a city police precinct's plain clothes cops; often gritty stories and characters. Gena Rowlands played Lansing's pretty mute wife, not always present but excellent whenever she was on.
When I was 11, my mom and I both enjoyed the show and it still holds up. Some younger viewers of the next generation may find the cops' tactics somewhat aggressive, but back then, it was more about putting bad guys away than protecting their rights. The show premiered in 1961, ran just a season. This collection is the complete series at a reasonable price. My only problem is the prints are not restored/remastered as other shows of the same vintage seem to be. It is not to the extent of my regretting the purchase, I just took it for granted it would be similar as a Hitchcock or Perry Mason episode that's on DVD.",1436313600,3,1116,4.728205128205128

5109660,5,B007S3GIM6,Love it.,1424822400,,8,3.5
5109661,5,B007S3GIM6,"I purchased this nearly three years ago as a birthday present to myself. As a teen I scoured used bookstores and purchased quite a few of the original small Ed McBain paperbacks. I loved the lurid covers. For the rest I collected whatever paperback edition was available. This long time interest in justice led to my majoring in criminal justice & psychology in college and grad school. Where I continued reading the new releases of this wonderful series.

There have been several attempts of turning books from this great series into movies. Unfortunately I never found one that measured up to Mr McBain's compelling novels. Then this superb series was released. I can't tell you how much I enjoyed each episode. I am watching it for a second time, which prompted me to write this review.

If you enjoyed the books you will definitely enjoy this early look at how police detectives operated. While Barney Miller was a comedic look at how detectives acted, this is a serious presentation of the inner workings of the detective's division. I can't praise this DVD set enough. I've found that many of the series and movies from the 50s and early 60s were of superior quality & featured superb performances despite being in B&W. This is one of them.

This is a hard hitting drama which is along the same lines as the series Highway Patrol, but there is a set of characters that make you root for them getting safety home at the end of their shift. Whose love and home life you get intimately involved in. How they work together and rely on each other is the glue that makes this such compelling viewing.",1424044800,,1600,4.646643109540636
5109662,5,B007S3GIM6,I haven't had the opportunity to see the show. But I saw the pilot episode on You Tube and loved it. I especially liked Gena Rowlands performance.,1423353600,,146,4.444444444444445
5109663,4,B007S3GIM6,"I've always been a fan of Ed McBain's books, and have indeed read every one of the 87th Precinct stories. Until recently, I'd had no idea that there was an associated TV series, so this came as a pleasant surprise. Considering the age ,and prevailing directorial methods of the time, it's as good as anything else I've seen from the era, and better than many. Even had it proved to be terrible, a true Ed McBain fan will have endless entertainment comparing scenarios with memories of the books. Sad that Meyer isn't bigger, balder and more obviously Jewish, and Roger Havilland was a rather unpleasant character in the books. That said, it's a minor miracle that the stories and characters weren't even more butchered, for which we should be grateful, I'm glad to own it.

5109664,5,B007S3GIM6,"Excellent writing, acting, and direction.  The only thing that dates it is the  beautiful B & W, the huge cars, everyone smoking, low wages, and very low prices of meals, goods, ransom money, etc.  Otherwise, this show could have gone on the air, untouched, today and been a hit.  It has no annoying voice-over narrative that so many of the police shows had around this time; just the story.  Very well worth buying.",1418083200,2,416,4.6438356164383565

I am a big fan of black/white old television shows, particulary of the crime and law genre.  I remember this series when it was on the tube and I was looking forward to revisiting Robert Lansing, who is a very much underated actor and character actors like Gregory Walcott, who was most famous for that big budget Ed Wood syfy Plan Nine from Outer Space.  I can still see him standing in front of the shower curtain that separated the cock pit from the passenger portion of the pie plate that doubled for a flying saucer.  But at least I could see him.  As I said earlier, the transfer was terrible and impossible to watch. This is as far away from the pristine print of the Perry Mason DVD collection as Ed Wood is from Sidney Lumet.",1406246400,,827,4.407894736842105

The stories were well done without being shoot 'em up, bloody. or overly/overtly sexy. This is one series I am happy to have in my DVD library. The characters are strong and well developed. Here, again, is a showcase for a stable of young actors early in their careers.

Well, the acting ensemble, led by Robert Lansing as Steve Carella and including Gina Rowlands as his wife Teddy, is top flight. And it doesn't hurt to have guests like Robert Culp dropping by. The plots, some scripted by McBain, are tight and suspenseful. Eight are adaptations of the author's novels. One of them, King's Ransom, not only was the basis for Akira Kurosawa's classic movie High and Low, its plot twist has been adopted by nearly every crime series to appear thereafter. The shows are well-directed. And, as best I can tell, they've been collecting dust for more than fifty years.

5109690,4,B007S3GIM6,"""87th Precinct"" surprised me.

I was kind of surprised to find that this series existed. Even though it originally aired when I was in third-grade I was a sickeningly media-savvy child ( Yes, THAT kid) and would have remembered this show had I ever come across it earlier in my life.

Never heard of it until the title popped up in Amazon'z recommendations for me one day.

Ed McBain 87th Precinct books kind of snuck up on me as well. In an odd twist of timing I was introduced to Sgt Steve Carella and company on September 12th, 2001 (the day after 9/11). That first ""87th Precinct"" story involved a bomb and I spent the entire time reading it with a slightly creeped-out feeling.

An off-balance feeling persists all the way through these episodes as well. ""87th Precinct"" never really quite decides if wants to be a police procedural or ""two-fisted"" pulp adventure. Maybe Joe Friday schooled me too rigidly through all those ""Dragnet"" episodes but I get a little nervous at Carella and company with their slightly casual attitude towards the chain of custody (of evidence) their collective tendency to work solo and emotional reactions that skew slightly further to the ""melodrama"" setting on the emo-meter.

I was also slightly disappointed that the character of Fat Ollie is omitted as well. It would have been interesting to see who would have been cast as the eating-burping-sniffing-farting-bigoted-and-slightly-shady cop that everyone loved to hate.

None of which is a deal-breaker. As ""THAT kid"" I may be technically correct about details, but any deficiency is more than made up for by  incredible McBain writing and Robert Lansing's uber-cool manner. I might also add that repetitive use of the word ""slight"" this review is intentional - just to emphasize that any flaws in the show are so minor that they don't really count. If you like polic shows - and classic early Sixties drama - you'll enjoy this series more than just a little bit.",1357776000,11,1953,4.864457831325301
5109691,5,B007S3GIM6,"This is a great series that got cancelled because the producer left the network. The writing is excellent, especially the episodes based on McBain's novels.

5109695,4,B007S3GIM6,"Ed McBain and his stories about the cops at the 87th precinct is classic crime novels. McBain changed the crime novel to be more down to earth than anyone else. If Raymond Chandler took the crime novel to the alley and the gutter took McBain the crime novel to be closer to the truth more than anyone else. Without McBain there would never been any The Wire or Homicide - Life on The Street just to mention a few. There would never been any Martin Beck or Kurt Wallander either to mention a few Swedish ""copy-cats"", if you get my drift.
This TV-series, never showned at least in Sweden is very true to the novels. Not all of the 30 episodes is based on novels but most are. They are for their time (1961 they were broadcasted on US-television) very ""modern"" and far better than most of other series from the same era.
You don't have to be a McBain-freak to enjoy them, you don't even have to be a lover on film-noir. You just need to enjoy a good crime story to enjoy this gem.",1347753600,6,977,4.258064516129032
5109696,4,B007S3GIM6,"87th Precinct was a show that was aired in 1961 for one season in black and white. It ran for 30 episodes which would be two seasons nowadays. It starred Robert Lansing,who was the Mysterious Mr Seven on the second season finale of ""Star Trek"".Also in the cast is Gregory Walcott seen as a heavy in many western series like ""Bonanza"", Norman Fell who would go on to play another detective alongside Burt Reynolds in ""Dan August"" before ending up as Mr Roper on the TV series ""Three's Company"".
Ron Harper is also here from ""Garrison's Gorilla's"" and the TV version of ""Planet of the Apes"". Gena Rowlands plays the deaf mute wife of Robert Lansing. She only appears in a few episodes though. I guess they didn't know what to do with her character.
Not a lot of big name guest stars here apart from Robert Culp ( I Spy )  Leonard Nimoy (Star Trek)  Robert Vaughan (The Man from UNCLE ) Peter Falk (Columbo ) Robert Colbert  (The Time Tunnel ).
This is a well produced series of cop drama's with entertaining stories. I had never seen this series before but was curious to see what it was all  about. I was pleased I did.",1347494400,7,1118,4.386473429951691

5109698,4,B007S3GIM6,"Never mind that it's in black and white, from the early 1960s, with no special effects to speak of. It follows some of the McBain novels pretty closely and gives a nice feel for the gritty city which was a character in his 87th Precinct series. The cast is better than average; quite a few went on to notable careers. Robert Lansing is a bit more macho than the Steve Carella portrayed in the books, but it works well enough. There is some of the snarky humor, toned down for the censors but present to leaven the grim tales of murder and the like. Similarly, gruesome details are edited out - a very pleasant change from today's guaranteed bloodbaths and forensic details. If you haven't read any of the police procedurals, though, this series might not hold you in its grip, compared with later gems like ""Hill Street Blues"". If you're already familiar with the 87th Precinct, especially the earliest books in the series, you will really enjoy these DVDs.",1345334400,22,957,4.635294117647059
8521584,4,B007S3GIM6,"It's wonderful to see the great old 87th Precinct novels translated to TV. But you have to remember that this series ran in 1961-62. The early 87th Precinct novels were tougher and more terse, and the beloved cops of the precinct had not yet been highly developed as characters like they are in the later 80's through early 2000's novels, which I think brought the series into the realm of great American literature.

In the TV series, Robert Lansing's Steve Carella is kind of morose, and he's a real tough guy, not the Steve Carella we know from the later novels. The cynical Meyer Meyer is portrayed well by Norman Fell (except he's not bald). Ron Harper's Bert  Kling is pretty close to the character in the books, and the fourth detective, Roger Havilland (Gregory Walcott) is an early character who disappeared from the later novels. But he's still one of ""the boys.""

This is hard core, gritty / noir police procedural, strictly the Good Guys getting the Bad Guys. But that's OK. McBain's plots stand the test of time. Settle back and time travel to an earlier era, and enjoy!

I would add that the modern police TV shows from Hill St. Blues through Law and Order all owe their existence to Ed McBain.",1528070400,,1208,4.604651162790698
