8015309,5,B0001NGIKC,"This is an excellent video, comical and very enterning.  Had this video when it first came out but I gave it to my grandson so I purchased a new one through Amazon, I am hanging on to this one.",1366934400,,193,3.948717948717949
8015310,3,B0001NGIKC,I was expecting a longer video and comedy.  Was really disappointed.  Probably great for someone really into yo-yo.  Didn't realize Smothers was such pro at yo-yo.,1316044800,,163,5.1923076923076925
8015311,1,B0001NGIKC,"I bought this vhs tape on Amaazon several months ago and put it up until a convenience time to show it to my grandkids. Wellllllllllll, to my surprise when I inserted the vhs tape it wld not play and I discovered that the front end of the tape was unattached (almost falling off) and that was why the vcr player kept rejecting it. I carefullly taped it back in place with scotch tape and gently inserted it into the vcr player again praying it wldnt get stuck. Fortunately it played, the kids highly enjoyed Tom Smothers teaching showing his yo-yo tricks, but I will not use this vhs tape again b/c I don't want to take a chance it will get stuck and damage my vcr. Seller should have examined item before mailing it to buyer!
Wasted Money!",1290124800,,740,4.369565217391305
8015312,5,B0001NGIKC,"Both my kids and I loved to watch this, and picked up new tricks as we laughed. Besides, it was nice to see Tommy Smothers show off some skills for a change.",1230163200,,157,3.9375
8015313,5,B0001NGIKC,"I bought this video for my son when he was about 8 yrs. old.  He loved it, his friends loved it, and now that he's all ""grown-up"", I hope it entices his children someday.  As a teacher, I have found that especially during the last two weeks of school (when the yo-yos come out to play) that this video fascinates kids from Kindergarten to grade six.  I highly recommend it for kids, and as a teacher, I might give out free yo-yos at the end of the school year!",1086048000,9,460,4.146067415730337
