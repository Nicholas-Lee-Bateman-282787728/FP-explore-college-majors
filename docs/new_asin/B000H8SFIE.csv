2631183,5,B000H8SFIE,I loved this!  Learned a lot of new information about Marie Antoinette!,1425081600,,71,4.916666666666667
2631184,2,B000H8SFIE,"Bad from start to finish... the narration is boring; the information given is either well-known (and much better presented many time before) or incorrect; and the classical background music comes in and out seemingly randomly. Visually it's also a mess, consisting of poorly pieced-together strings of (mostly outdated, even at the time) stock photos, with some stock video footage thrown in. The visual quality overall is poor - and not just because it's low-res; the editors didn't even bother color-correcting over-exposures or color matching one image to the next. Additionally, throughout the film, there are numerous instances when what shows on-screen has very little to do with what's being discussed, which is just confusing - and odd.

There are so many more documentaries available on this fascinating woman - many of which are many times better, more visually interesting, factually accurate and / or entertaining than this.  Save your money and buy one of those - this was an incredible let-down.",1422576000,5,1009,5.260869565217392
2631185,1,B000H8SFIE,"One of the worst documentaries I have ever seen. Other reviewers have sufficiently described its shortcomings (horrible narration, bad stock footage often not matching what is being described, etc). I'd like to add that the history presented, in addition to being horribly inaccurate, is almost pro-monarchical in tone and seems to assume that the French Revolution was in every way a negative occurrence. Merde of the highest order, as well as the ridiculous repeated assertion that all of Marie Antoinette's flaws and misjudgments were youthful and that her conduct during the Revolution was uniformly mature, brave, and selfless. More merde: she did plenty of things in that period which contributed to her fate.

To say this film comes off as a bad high-school level video is to insult high-school videos. I wish I had read the reviews before watching: avoid this as you would the guillotine.",1419724800,4,896,5.136986301369863

2631188,1,B000H8SFIE,"this documetary sounds like it is being narrated for children, like a kindergarden class. And it is boring. Don't recommend. The narrator at several points says ""lets take a look at that, shall we?"" like he is talking to a group of kids. The entire documentary is made up of someone with a camera walking around, and pictures and childish drawings, and then real life actors being shot with a camera. It is like someone made this documentary while on vacation on France. It is a shame, because a lot of the actual information in it is interesting.",1360972800,4,547,4.591836734693878
2631189,1,B000H8SFIE,I won't go into a lot of text here...what has been written before is correct. Awful video....a lot of stock footage of buildings and gardens..and not much else....bad research...facts given are sometimes wrong and the narrator is terrible. It's as though he narrated this DVD for a bunch of twelve year olds...At one point he calls the Temple of Love the Temple of Luvv...dreadfull...stick to David Grubin's DVD of Marie Antoinette..it is excellent,1323302400,13,448,5.1506849315068495
2631190,1,B000H8SFIE,"This is quite possibly the worst historical film/documentary ever made.  It is difficult to know where to even begin.  The narrator (credited as Jack Roberts) is so inept and amateurish, and Mr. Roberts has absolutely no clue about pronouncing French names, locales, words . . . it is literally a slaughter of the French language. (Mr. Roberts has equal problems with a number of words in his own English language.)  The visuals are lamentable beyond comprehension.  The onscreen images frequently have absolutely no relationship or connection -- even in the most random sense -- to what is being discussed in the narration. 90% of the film looks like it was probably sourced from free public domain footage.  Lengthy portions of Versailles footage are flickering, sepia-toned silent-era film, undoubtedly taken by one of the first movie cameras ever to capture Versailles.  But incredibly, some of the buildings pictured during the description of Versailles are NOT Versailles.  They are of the Louvre. The flickering of this sequence, however, is so severe as to almost be seizure-inducing.  The music is so ill-chosen as to be laughable -- during a long, languid (but dim) pan of Versailles' Hall of Mirrors, the entire Humming Chorus from Puccini's ""Madama Butterfly"" is played -- a piece of music which has no relationship to Marie Antoinette, France, or any conceivable connection to the subject matter, and was composed over 150 years AFTER the reign of Marie Antoinette.  At other times, great expanses of Handel's ""Messiah"" are played, another piece of music which has absolutely no historical, cultural or any other relationship to the subject matter of this film. There is also plenty of Beethoven, and tons of Schubert -- both historically and culturally inaccurate.  But not one French composer during the entire film.  Where was the music of court composer Francois Giroust, who composed the music for Louis XVI's Coronation, and his wedding to Marie Antoinette; or the music of Franois Joseph Gossec and Andr Modeste Grtry, or even those veritable but still-popular holdovers from earlier reigns, the composers Lully and Rameau -- any of which WOULD have been the music of Marie Antoinette's life at Versailles.  The footage is equally inexplicable -- at one point, while the narrator is talking about the marriage of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI, the onscreen footage is of a modern Paris hotel lit by neon and flashing lights, with cars driving by, and shoppers carrying Gucci bags. An earlier description of the Paris of Louis XVI's time pans in on The Eiffel Tour and The Moulin Rouge. A description of the Vienna of Marie Antoinette's 1755 birth shows automobiles on the streets, and motor boats on the Danube.  At another point, a reference to smallpox shows a World War I-era black and white photo of a bloated corpse covered with thousands of pustuals that was so grotesque as to be sickening. The worst thing about this film, however, is that the facts are frequently incorrect, the chronology is frequently skewed, and it is often just plain wrong.  There is a very limited amount of new footage which was filmed for some of the interstitial sequences, but it looks like it was produced and acted by the local high school drama class, and filmed by the geeks in the AV Club.  In short, DON'T BUY THIS.  Do yourself a favor, read Antonia Fraser's excellent ""Marie Antoinette: The Journey,"" which while controversial in some quarters, was thoroughly researched and presented a historically fresh portrait of Marie Antoinette. Or buy Sophia Coppola's visually-stunning ""Marie Antoinette,"" which while also controversial to some (I loved it), depicted the court life at Versailles with absolutely extraordinary (and factually accurate) beauty, thanks to previously unprecedented access to Versailles, Le Petite Trianon, the Hameau, and other areas of the royal estate. David Grubin's PBS documentary about Marie Antoinette is also vastly superior to this horrendous DVD, as is the fascinating and eerily beautiful DVD ""La Petite Musique de Marie Antoinette,"" which takes the viewer into the previously-unseen secret inner-sanctum of Marie Antoinette's own jewel-box-like private, personal theatre, where she herself took to the stage.  This incredibly gorgeous treasure of a petite theatre is adjacent to The Petite Trianon, and through its walls, nooks, and crannies you can glimpse moments of Marie Antoinette's private life in a way never before seen on film. (""Le Petite Musique de Marie Antoinette"" is also an amazing resource for lovers of theatre in general, as it shows the clever stage mechanics of a circa 1780 theatre.)  All of these films will be so much more rewarding and satisfying -- and educational -- than this totally lamentable and lame DVD reviewed here, which is just plain bad.",1292198400,33,4823,5.145780051150895
2631191,3,B000H8SFIE,"This must have been designed to be viewed in a high school history class.  The work's point is that Marie Antoinette was at the wrong place at the wrong time.  French royalty had been opulent since the Sun King's reign and by the 1790s, they just couldn't afford that anymore.  It states that she did tone down her spending as she became a mother and matured.  It brings up a point that had she lived as long as Queens Elizabeth and Victoria, then maybe she would have had the time to be inspiring as they were.

Now if you're like me, you got an interest in seeing this because you just saw S. Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette.""  So let me list some of the ways the work differed.

So many biographical documentaries tone down the bisexuality or homosexuality of their subjects.  I recently saw a work on Greta Garbo that said she was only ""speculatively"" lesbian, however, other sources list her as clearly having several lesbian relationships.  Many works on Langston Hughes or George Washington Carver just say ""they never married"" and don't dig deeper.  Whereas Coppola never touched the rumors of Marie's having lesbian relations, this work emphasized that the French working-class gossiped about that rumor often.  In fact, this work is rare in that it mentions a woman who spreads such gossip saying she herself got down with Marie.  This work never says Marie and Captain Fersen had an extramarital relationship.  It's rare, very rare, for a work to emphasize a famous person's homosexuality over her or his heterosexuality.

In addition to the sexuality dynamic, gender was different here as well.  In Coppola's film, Marie bows to a crowd of working-class women and men and the crowd's response is not really captured.  This documentary, said, the crowd was composed of biological women and cross-dressed men.  After Marie bowed, they chanted ""Vive la reine!""

This work shows Marie painted in hats more.  Coppola focused on wigs and I wonder if she didn't want hats casting shadows on Kirsten Dunst's face.  Coppola features one of Marie's children dying in infancy, but this work says two died at that age.  This work says Louis XVI was beheaded before Marie; I would have assumed they were beheaded close to the same time.  This work emphasizes her waste more.  In Coppola's movie, Marie seems to spend money on frivolity because she could and that no one told her the wiser.

 The narrator had terrible French pronunciation of which he should be truly ashamed.  In both film and documentary, Marie is shown writing to her birth family in English, when surely she would have written in a German dialect.  It's emphasized that both French and German royalty had many members that died of diseases for which we now have cures.  It didn't seem that their class status protected their health in the way that health and wealth are tied together now.",1173398400,11,2853,4.814814814814815
2631192,1,B000H8SFIE,"This ""documentary"" is a farce...a generalized, incorrect and painfully boring view into history. This ""documentary"" is what gives history a bad name, it might as well have been Charlie Brown's teacher speaking. This is the kind of thing that makes people hate history. In addition to being wrong...its just painful. The producers and whoever funded this should be ashamed.",1452124800,,372,5.322033898305085

2631198,1,B000H8SFIE,"I've seen some poorly narrated documentaries, but this is the worst, so far. The narrative sounded like it was written for youngsters, and I'm not even sure some of that was true. It sounded as if it was ""polished over"" for kids to understand that she really was a nice princess when she married  Louis. I don't think she was anything but a self-centered person, spoiled and immature, though I don't believe she should have been executed so horribly and disgraced. My advice is don't bother with this badly written part of history. I read a good biography about her from the library.",1430870400,3,583,4.660194174757281
