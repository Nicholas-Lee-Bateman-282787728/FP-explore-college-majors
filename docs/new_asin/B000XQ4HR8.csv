3005030,5,B000XQ4HR8,"Fact or Fiction may be the big debate until the end of time when talking about the great documentary film THE KING OF KONG - A Fistful of Quarters but regardless of your viewpoint all will admit that this compelling look at two of the top Donkey Kong players in the world is vibrant, funny and fascinating!

Director Seth and Producer Ed travel to various events and stay long enough to capture magic moments with legendary gamer Billy Mitchell, contender Steve Wiebe and Twin Galaxies founder Walter Day!

Gamer or not - this film has moments that will surprise and shock you.  There are unexpected twists throughout the 90 minutes that will keep you on the edge of your couch.  Looking forward to seeing some leftover and outtake footage that will be a huge bonus on the DVD release.  A rare and controversial peak into the mindset of classic arcade gamers from both sides of the quarter!

3005031,5,B000XQ4HR8,"I wouldn't be at all surprised if this movie didn't get an Oscar nomination for best documentary. The critics and audiences have all loved it, unfortunately, it didn't get a wide release. (What's up with those distribution deals anyway?) However, I am more than confident that it will become a cult classic once the DVD is released. It's so rare to find a doc that features characters like these. And yes, these are REAL people! The producers struck a goldmine with Billy Mitchell whose ego is so big it has it's own orbit. And Steve Weibe, the down on his luck teacher with a heart of gold... who couldn't love him? Not me. I don't want to spoil the sheer genius of this movie for anyone so please, just trust me on this, buy this movie! You'll love it, you'll want to share it, give it to people as gifts, have KING OF KONG parties... the list is endless. Enjoy!",1199836800,,864,4.40625
3005032,5,B000XQ4HR8,"The King of Kong is possibly the best movie I saw during 2007 (and I saw alot of movies).  What makes it outstanding is that it's a simple story of good against evil played out between normal guys (maybe even less than normal when you factor in the Geek Quotient) and it's 100% true!

I won't spoil things but any fan of wrestling, video games, or funny movies will appreciate the trials of Face-Hero cum everyman Steve Weibe as he tries to set the world record for Donkey Kong.  In the process Weibe battles the very tight knit nerd ""cult"" of record holders who are not interested in seeing an outsider break through.  And...I haven't even mentioned our Heel-Villain Billy Mitchell, possibly the cockiest man to ever smile on camera as he speaks about himself in the 3rd Person!

5 minutes into this movie you'll find yourself cheering for Weibe and hissing at Mitchell and you'll still have plenty of movie to entertain you. Overall this is an A+ movie and one of the funniest and most original documentaries I have seen since...well since Arcades were a favorite mall hang-out.",1198195200,17,1080,4.663157894736842
3005033,5,B000XQ4HR8,"i have a feeling that after this has been on dvd for awhile there will be tons of people getting back into donkey kong, and it's easy to see why. this movie is hilarious and oddly touching. it gives interesting insights into the world of a certain hobby that most don't know exists. i would recommend it to anyone, and have convinced most of my friends to watch it. so far i have not had one single person not fall in love with it.

but...

it is easy to watch it and be convinced that bill mitchell is a bad guy to some degree. that is simply not true. the movie uses clever cutting and leaves out some important moments to guide the viewer into a mindset that billy is a megalomaniac. you can easily look on the internet and find numerous sites and posts that spell out scene by scene things that were ommitted and give differing points of view that show billy is not a monster.

the movie is very entertaining, but take your entertainment with a grain of salt.",1197072000,,963,4.28021978021978
3005034,5,B000XQ4HR8,"Okay, well maybe not the greatest battle of all time, but a damn entertaining one.

""The King of Kong"" is an excellent documentary that looks at classic gaming. It features many of gamings greatest records holders such as Todd Rogers, Billy Mitchell, and controversial ""Missile Command"" record holder ""Mr. Awesome"" himself, Roy Shildt.

If you have an interest in classic gaming you should see this movie. Even if you don't have an interest in classic gaming you should still see this movie. It is entertaining and funny throughout.",1196899200,14,532,5.034090909090909
3005035,5,B000XQ4HR8,"From euphoric heights to crashing lows, this movie made me feel everything that movies are supposed to make us feel. It would be easy to adopt a condescending posture toward the subjects, but to do so would be a big mistake. On some level, the struggle between Steve Wiebe and Billy Mitchell exists in all of us... and we all possess attributes of both men. That pathos we all experience makes King of Kong one of the most satisfying experiences I've had going to the movies in a long time.",1196121600,,490,4.455555555555556
3005036,5,B000XQ4HR8,"I've seen a lot of so-called comedies in the past few years but not one comes close to the truth-is-funnier-than-fiction genius in King of Kong.

The director understands the documentary form well and lets it work for itself. The story unfolds quickly and slyly and the two main characters (and characters they are) are brought to life, and then some. I laughed out loud again and again and again at the endless irony in this flick, at what it says about where we are as a culture and a species, and at the perfect silliness of it all.

Mr. Blow Dry and his little world are so hilarious that you know it all has to be real...no one could write anything this ridiculous! Toss in Steve's obsession and the beyond-funny comments of his kids and you've got pure humor.

The other folks who populate this saga each have their own moments of goofy glory to add until it all becomes a fascinating examination of human nature. That the subject of the rivalry is an old video game only adds to the tragi-comic dimensions.

I saw King Of Kong at one of the few theatres to screen it in the country (big props to the Alamo; this deserved much wider release), and walked away feeling surprised and happy after laughing so much and so hard. Who woulda thunk there was this much catharsis in a movie about two middle-aged video game freaks? I'm guessing that within a few years this will be a true cult classic. It sure deserves to be; it's one of the most subtle and beautifully-edited documentaries in many a year.

And man is it funny.",1192924800,10,1525,4.471223021582734

3005040,5,B000XQ4HR8,I teach film production at a university and I bought this to show to my documentary filmmaking classes.  It is an excellent example of how a good doc can make you care about something that you never thought you'd care about.  I love seeing the young women in the class start out rolling their eyes but quickly get drawn into the story.  This doc is consitantly a class favorite.,1490313600,4,378,4.449275362318841

3005045,5,B000XQ4HR8,"This is a great documentary, partly because the Mitchell character is as lame as they come. Wiebe seems like an overall sound human being. He demonstrates sound work ethic, has a lovely family, and just an overall nice guy. Then comes in this Mitchell guy, who's like Shooter from Happy Gilmore. Just a guy who lives for his records, even if they're not real records anymore. The kind of neighborhood kid who knows very well Street Fighter II was the real start of the Capcom fighter game craze, but because he sucks at it, yet is good at Street Fighter I (just because no one plays that anymore), he tries to sabotage the Street Fighter II machine or pretends it's not all that -- when you know it was all that!

Dude knows that Wiebe's video was as legit as they come, so he hires his crony friends to investigate and, after a legit machine at home, still ultimately gets Wiebe's record disqualified. Hey, but that makes for your textbook villain, so I guess this documentary is good in the sense that some lame-o is actually willing to go textbook Disney villain on you. I'm sure Mitchell even cackled at home once his crony friends verified that Wiebe won't be a problem anymore. Go full Dr. Evil, I guess. Super formulaic, but people like that actually exist.

I'm glad Wiebe showed genes have the ultimate say, and a superior score eventually does resurface again for Wiebe -- when you're better, you're better. Take that title back! It was satisfying. Good job, Mr. Mitchell for playing the lame villain.

Then I hear someone beat his Pac-Man score too. Funny as hell to hear that he claimed to be really close to  getting that perfect score too, but oh, a kid pulls the chord and the game ended. Ha ha! I tell you, he's that kid that would do anything to not admit defeat, because that's all you live for. To win. Even if that win is a lie. But it's hilarious to see the joke keeps playing itself out. Mr. Mitchell never deserved his records, when you're a douche and can't pass the torch, when it's already old as all hell. Some kind of resurgence happened as it seems a flood of people came in to throw these two titans far away from even the top 10 in the world. For Donkey Kong and PAC-MAN.",1486598400,,2202,4.443069306930693
3005046,5,B000XQ4HR8,"The King of Kong gives you a great look at the lives of these two Donkey Kong masters, achieving high scores on camera in the effort to top each other's highest score. While film editing can distort perceptions of the stars, much of the film seems to give a fair view of what counts the most, these heroes achieving their highest scores at one of the more challenging video games in the arcades.

What is nice about this documentary, is the decent  footage of Donkey Kong in play, yet ultimately, it would be even better if we got to see at least one full level completed without interruption. Yet that brings up the point that in order for these gaming stars to reach their best run through, they have to do repetitious movements and actions to do it. With that in mind, it's completely understandable why the filmmakers chose not to show an entire level's completion. Learning about these two competitors, and all they had to sacrifice to succeed among many set backs, gives this film an entertaining quality for gamers and non gamers alike.",1486080000,,1043,4.632432432432433

Apparently someone beat both Steve and Billy's records by a long shot so hopefully they get on with their lives.  My favorite part of the movie is when Steve's little daughter says that people ruin their lives trying to get into the guiness book of records.

In fact, it took me a year to get around to watching it because the premise just sounded so lame. I won't even try to explain it, I'll just tell you this: If you love the cringe-worthy episodes of the office (us), the delusional arrogance of fictional characters like Dwight Shrute, you'll love this movie. At first I really didn't think Billy Mitchell was a real person, I thought this was a mockumentary. Even more so in the scene when Brian Kuh is calling him to conspire against steve weib from the other side of the arcade. This just seemed like a scene straight out of the office, the strangely loyal Dwight trying hard to protect his ""hero"" who has done little to deserve such loyalty.

in the end, I can't decide if I think it's sad or funny that Steve Weibe and a few other ""normal"" people get caught up in this delusional little world of competitive classic arcade gaming.

3005193,5,B000XQ4HR8,"Best ""videogame movie"" ever made. Except, it really isn't just about the game. It's about the people who emerge around it. It's like a microcasm of lunacy and it's extremely entertaining. The 60 year old ""game referee"" hippie, the douche bag with the high score, his loyal minion, the good guy trying to topple the ""empire."" It's all very rich and the best part is that it's factual.

Though there are some inaccurecies, such as Wiebe submitting only one tape (he submitted four) it's never made up, just ommitted. The advertising sells it as a comedy, but though this is comedic, it's not just that. It's about people doing extraordinary things just to prove a small, but important, point. It's about the lengths people will go to confirm themselves on an old 1981 machine. Yes, they're all pretty much lunatics, but they're lunatics you can understand :D

3005207,4,B000XQ4HR8,"This documentary tells the unlikely story of Steve Wiebe. Laid off from his job and with lots of time on his hands he decides to try and break the all-time high score on Donkey Kong, a 1980s arcade game. The record has been the same for over 20 years, held by video gaming legend Billy Mitchell. Steve films his attempts and when he finally breaks the record, sends the tape off to a small organization of people who have set themselves up as the keeper of the records. They disallow his record game for murky reasons so Steve flies across the country to New Hampshire to a gathering of gamers to play live. There he breaks the record again. Having witnessed it, they proclaim him the new king of Donkey Kong . . . until . . . they view a video tape sent by Billy Mitchell showing him recording an even higher score. Wiebe continues his quest but also tries to get Mitchell to come out and play him live head-to-head. Mitchell refuses to play.

Steve Wiebe comes off as a sympathetic figure. Out of work and feeling bad about himself he turns to the video game record as a way to boost his self esteem while he figures his future out. Billy Mitchell is portrayed as a narcissistic douche who's scared to lose. Twin Galaxies, the organization given the power to accept or deny a filmed score, seems to want to do the right thing but are all too enamored of players like Billy and their sense of entitlement. They seemed reluctant to accept Steve's score mainly because they didn't know him. He was an interloper into their insular world and on top of that was a better player than them.

The movie was funny at places that weren't necessarily intentional. The seriousness with which these video games records are taken by some of the participants leads to laughs.

3005228,5,B000XQ4HR8,"Much like video games themselves, King Of Kong is highly addictive.  The story does look at the history of video games and the high scores people achieve on them, but the essence of the documentary revolves around unassuming nice guy Steve Wiebe, a virtual unknown in the competitive gaming field and brash, cocky and arrogant Billy Mitchell, named gamer of the century and generally considered the greatest gamer of all time.  Mr. Wiebe has set out to break Mr. Mitchell's long standing Donkey Kong high score record.  Spending hours mastering the game in his garage and filming his attempts, he finally thinks he breaks the record.  When he sends it in for verification to Twin Galaxies, the organization that tracks and verifies the records, he is denied as his machine is inspected and found to contain a circuit board provided by Roy Schildt who is Mr. Mitchell's nemesis. Forced to play in person at the official gaming arcade in New Hampshire, Mr. Wiebe must force the people at Twin Galaxies to not just accept his high score, but fight for his integrity and credibility as player, Mr. Wiebe does indeed break Mr. Mitchell's score.  Despite Mr. Mitchell railing against players who videotape themselves in order to break records, he sends in a tape to Twin Galaxies that shows he re-sets the high score.  The tape is accepted as authentic and the score goes into the Guinness Book of World Records.  The heart of any good documentary is the subjects and Mr. Wiebe and Mr. Mitchell are highly compelling figures.  You find yourself rooting for the steely determination of Mr. Wiebe while finding yourself hating Mr. Mitchell as a braggart who is trying desperately to hold on to past glories as he sees them starting to slip away.",1324252800,,1737,4.824915824915825

3005230,5,B000XQ4HR8,"There really is no denying the allure of classic video games. Games like Pac Man, Donkey Kong, Centipede, Joust, Defender, and Galaga are simple in terms of graphics and goals. These were the classic ""man vs computer"" machines that judged a player's skills based on the points system. After this generation of classic video games, scores are pretty much obsolete for the next generation of video games since the whole object is to complete the game. The points total represented a gamer's skill in classic pattern recognition, quick reaction, critical thinking, pattern analysis and response, as well as hand-eye coordination. These vintage games will never be equaled, and will continue to live on.

This documentary represents both the old and the new very well in terms of the actual gamers that love and play these games competitively. The film kicks off with a little background and then jumps right into the story of Billy Mitchell, the man who holds the title of ""Gamer of the 20th Century"", as well as several record-breaking scores in classic games. Billy Mitchell's story originates in 1982 when he was named the World Champion at Centipede for his high score and then challenged the Donkey Kong champion. Mitchell, in public, set an astounding record at Donkey Kong that would be unrivaled for over 20 years. The documentary spends a few minutes interviewing Mitchell who attributes his entreprenurial success (he owns a successful restaurant chain and a business that sells hot sauce) to his passion to succeed, the same passion he applies to classic video games. In short, the interviews with Mitchell sell the viewers a portrayal of Mitchell as a seemingly arrogant man who appears to believe himself as infallible.

The documentary then shifts gears as we are introduced to Steve Wiebe, a humble and likeable family man that appears to have caught several tough breaks in life. Wiebe one night sees Billy Mitchell's high score posted on the Twin Galaxies website and dedicates himself to conquering the score, which he ultimately does. He then submits the recording of him breaking the score to Twin Galaxies, the organization that recognizes, authenticates, and records high scores in classic games.

From here, the documentary launches into the real meat-and-potatos portion of the film, which is the rivalry of Billy Mitchell vs Steve Wiebe in Donkey Kong. Controversy surrounds both Mitchell and Wiebe's submitted recordings, and Wiebe is drawn to an annual convention at a classic arcade spot on the east coast that encourages competitive gamers to come and attempt records in public. To Wiebe, this is an opportunity to settle the score and end the controversy. Unfortunately, more controversy ensues and Wiebe returns to the arcade some time later only to come up short. The documentary ends on a high note as a post-production note reveals that Wiebe would eventually be recognized as the record holder for the high score of Donkey Kong.

What makes this documentary so compelling is the fueled rivalry between Mitchell and Wiebe. The two really couldn't be further different from each other outside of their desire to be the record-holder. Mitchell is a respected and recognized semi-celebrity that appears to have always have luck on his side and comes across as conceited, whereas Wiebe is a very humble and likeable family man with no video game pedigree whatsoever, and doesn't really appear to have a vicious fiber in his body. Despite the fact that the movie centers wholly on these two persons, they are only in the same room once in the whole film, which is nothing more than a brief encounter where Mitchell appears to rudely snub Wiebe at the arcade. This encounter, while no more than a few seconds in length, is central to summing up the attitudes of the two main characters. Wiebe calls Mitchell several times to inquire whether or not he will appear at the arcade, but never actually gets ahold of him. Wiebe asks other gamers who are friends of Mitchell whether or not Mitchell will show, and other than Mitchell's brief cameo at the arcade, he never does.

The controversy reaches a fever pitch when Mitchell is on the phone with a friend at the arcade who witnesses Wiebe breaking Mitchell's Donkey Kong score in public. Wiebe enjoys a humble celebration for only one day when Mitchell submits a controversial video tape of himself breaking one million points. Twin Galaxies officially recognizes Mitchell's questionable score and Wiebe is instantly unseated as champion. This instance comes across as highly questionable in the film not only due to the screen flickering on Mitchell's recording, but also because interview footage earlier in the film have Mitchell stating that video recordings are meaningless, that the score must be demonstrated in public. Also, Wiebe had submitted a tape to Twin Galaxies earlier in the film of himself breaking one million points, but Twin Galaxies refused to recognize the score because it was on a video tape. For the most part, Twin Galaxies and even Billy Mitchell appear quite the hypocrites at this point in the film.

It's hard to fault Mitchell though. Personally, I understand that the film was pushing an agenda and the rivalry and controversy does make for great entertainment. The only entities that I truly fault are Twin Galaxies and their staff. True, they are promoting a very fascinating rivalry, but they appear quite biased towards promoting Billy Mitchell as the superstar gamer while taking dubious actions towards disputing Wiebe's accomplishments. Mitchell may have acted hypocritical, but Twin Galaxies rewarded the behavior of Mitchell and unfairly punished Wiebe. On top of that, the friends of Mitchell take part in some very absurd behavior, constantly calling Mitchell and informing him of Wiebe's whereabouts and actions. At one point, they even shun Wiebe for appearing at the same restaurant they are eating at. Twin Galaxies really does look foolish for their display of childishness in the film, and official ""game referee"" Walter Day emails Wiebe an apology after Wiebe leaves. To me, this action also comes across as hypocritical as the email reads that ""Twin Galaxies apologizes for any perceived mistreatment."" Clearly, it was easier for Twin Galaxies to apologize impersonally via email as opposed to in person and after he had already returned home to Washington. On top of that, the apology is meaningless since it doesn't change the fact that Twin Galaxies did treat Wiebe, an extraordinary gamer, unfairly and like an outcast.

The film comes across as very entertaining, and the personalities involved are very dynamic and interesting. Since then, a newcomer by the name of Chien has thrown his skills into the mix, but this original rivalry over the top score in Donkey Kong is remarkable and compelling.",1321142400,2,6829,5.075690115761353
3005231,5,B000XQ4HR8,"This is an excellent documentary that will keep you on the edge of your seat for its duration. It follows Steve Weibe, an amateur Donkey Kong enthusiast on his journey to beating Donkey Kong champion Billy Mitchell's top score. It doesn't matter if you follow arcade gaming or not, this documentary is more about how Weibe is consumed by the competitiveness of the gaming scene and how he overcomes the obstacles thrown by his opponents while remaining an honest person.

What makes this documentary great is that was not dramaticized. Most of the information is presented via interviews with Weibe, Mitchell, Mrs Weibe and the head referees of Twin Galaxies, the official world body for arcade video gaming. The tone is very candid and relaxed. You get an insight into Weibe's personal life and how his journey took an emotional toll on him. By the end of it, I was quite inspired by Weibe's determination. I think there were many lessons to be learnt from this piece.",1320624000,,969,4.802395209580839
3005232,5,B000XQ4HR8,"The thing is, *I* used to be heavily into video games back in the early 80's. I dumped probably thousands of dollars in quarters down those thirsty video boxes; a few of them I got good at. Donkey Kong was not one of them, (neither Pacman or Space Invaders. Galaga was my game.)

Anyway, you turn some corner at some time and video games are no longer interesting. Everything moved to the TV games boxes anyway, so . . .

Who knew there was a *very serious* cadre of 40ish men out there still taking not just video games seriously, but an entire subculture of high scores and ""officially sanctioned"" record keeping bodies.

Watch this movie and you'll find out tons more about this than you ever thought possible. Its *amazing* the producers actually caught this while it happened: some ""baby face"" upstart decides to challenge a decades old high score on Donkey Kong - one of the most difficult and never-ending video games ever produced. Not only does he set the record, he runs smack into one of the strangest sub-cultures around: *Idol Worship* of the long-reigning Grand Poobah of Kong, Billy Mitchell, (not the airplane pilot.)

Turns out ol' Billy played lights out back in the mid 80's and actually became Lord of this very small but incredibly competitive and serious-minded game players. (When you step back and consider, in the grand light of all things, who could possibly care about any of this; and then you find these guys totally wrapped up, its a recipe for endless head-shaking.)

Cheating? Did someone say *cheating?* Yep, this genre is so hardscrabble and cut throat that some have even dared to jimmy the game itself to get an advantage, (and the baby faced upstart is accused of using a ""tricked up"" video machine from a known cheater.) The lengths some people will go to . . .

Billy Mitchell. Massive head-case here. Holding onto his high record status like King Saul. Will not even VISUALLY ACKNOWLEDGE his competition when he makes a ""special appearance"" at his home town arcade.

Oh, that's right. There are some out of the way nooks and crannies in this country that are actually considered MECAS for 30 year old video game machines, and hold national tournaments on a yearly basis, (and you can just smell the testosterone.)

If you ever read or saw the movie King Rat, you'll understand a bit more of how this works; one guy and ONE GUY ONLY is going to be at the top of this heap, and that's Billy Mitchell. He's played Svengali over this post-adolescent enclave for 30 some years, and NO ONE wants to see him deposed. Not the hard-core gamers, not the oh-so-serious ""sanctioning body,"" and of course, not Billy himself.

An amazing look into a world I myself am staggered even exists. Who knew?",1319673600,,2726,4.674321503131524

I don't want to say too much or cast too many opinions of things in this movie, because I don't want to spoil anything, but I definitely have respect for Steve Weibe...and all of the gamers in this movie for that matter.  I love many of the old games, and they have done stuff on them I could only dream about.  On the whole, if you're a gamer or you just want to see a cool story with determination and heart, this is definitely worth a watch.",1319328000,,734,4.297101449275362
3005234,4,B000XQ4HR8,"I hadn't thought of the game Donkey Kong in years when I came across the documentary The King of Kong. Through the documentary I learned that - for some- Donkey Kong never went away. The documentary focuses on the lengths to which people will go to gain a bit of notoriety and it also allows the viewer to meet some interesting characters.

The tension in the film comes when an upstart gamer from Washington state - Steve Wiebe - challenges the long-held record of the legendary Billy Mitchell. The film portrays Wiebe as a likable everyman and Mitchell as an evil schemer. The attempt at the record is all that happens in the film, but it's still quite interesting; the viewer comes away wondering why people become so absorbed in their hobbies and whether such hobbies can ever be healthy.

The King of Kong is an interesting, unique documentary.",1307577600,,849,4.691275167785235
3005235,5,B000XQ4HR8,"Man, I am all worked up after watching this fascinating film.  The King of Kong is about so much more than a video game record - this really is good vs. evil, the all-American underdog vs. the privileged elite, the little guy vs. city hall, etc.  It doesn't matter if you've never played a video game in your life.  If you have a competitive bone in your body or if you value truth and justice above deviousness and chicanery, you will find yourself drawn into this story.  For those of us who grew up playing Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, Galaga, and the like, it's an especially meaningful story - and the taint of unsportsmanlike conduct hits us even harder because of the nexus we can't help but draw with our own childhoods.  Donkey Kong may be ""just a silly video game,"" but this story about one man's attempt to break the world record becomes a metaphor for life and how to live it in the hands of these talented filmmakers.  Lest you think all nerds are the same, prepare to meet some true characters in this gaming drama.  You couldn't invent the likes of Billy Mitchell, the prima donna of gaming, or Walter Day, the folk-singing, self-appointed commissioner of classic arcade competitive gaming.

Steve Wiebe is the quintessential good guy, an all-American kid who grew up to become a devoted husband, father, and teacher.  For whatever reason along the way, he just couldn't get a break each time he put himself in a position to realize his dreams.  After he was laid off from work, he set himself the goal of breaking the world record score for the original arcade version of Donkey Kong.  And break it he does, capturing the entire game on video - with one of his small children hollering at him in the background about a certain hygiene emergency at one point.  All he has to do is send the tape in to the official scorekeepers and reap the glory of his feat - or so you would think.  Unfortunately, Wiebe's moment in the sun comes to an abrupt end when the self-proclaimed lord of classic arcade game records, Walter Day of Twin Galaxies, proves himself to be little more than a puppet for longtime champion Billy Mitchell and comes up with an excuse to disqualify Wiebe's score when he learns that the circuit board for Wiebe's machine was supplied by Roy Shildt, one of Mitchell's bitter gaming enemies.  Oh, but Wiebe is more than welcome to come to Funspot Arcade in New Hampshire and prove himself on an officially sanctioned machine.  Wiebe does just that and proceeds to break the record right there in front of the gaming elite, including Billy Mitchell spies reporting every one of his moves to the mullet-headed king.  Ah, but Mitchell is prepared for that - with a tape of his own showing him breaking Wiebe's new record.  Strangely enough, there's a distortion in the tape right when the score maxes out and resets itself to zero - but Walter Day quickly declares it official and restores the crown to Billy Mitchell.

Wiebe returns home and seemingly gives up his fight - until he hears that the next edition of Guinness World Records is going to include the names of Twin Galaxies record holders.  This mild-mannered everyman calls Billy Mitchell out and makes the journey to Mitchell's very home town, setting the stage for the long-awaited head-to-head challenge between the two.  Will it actually happen?  Will the champion who goes on and on about how the only scores that matter are the ones from live competitions yet depends on questionable videos of his own making to retain the crown finally face his biggest challenger face to face?  Will justice finally be served?  Believe me - you're going to want to find out what happens, even if you've never played a video game in your life.  While this may not really be a battle of good vs evil, it certainly does feel like it.  If there is anyone who actually supports the cowardly Billy Mitchell, I wouldn't want to be in the same room with him during or after watching this fascinating and adrenaline-pumping documentary.  The most amazing - and darn near frightening - thing of all is that the filmmakers have said that Mitchell is an even darker character than they made him out to be in the film.",1298851200,2,4176,4.624661246612466

The documentary is very good, as they actually show the record attempts and informs the viewers of the rules of competitive gaming. From what is allowed and against the rules.

*A very history of Donkey Kong
*An update (a lot has happened between the time the documentary was finishing filming and the movie's release)
*Some key terms in competitive gaming
*Some artwork (there is even one on the other side of the jacket)

The filmmakers do a great job of making the viewer actually care about a static, clunky video game arcade machine.

It ultimately comes down to characters, and the way they are portrayed in this film leaves no room for subtle consideration.  Who the viewer is rooting for in the competition is obvious.  Manipulative film making?  Perhaps.  But surprisingly riveting.  Sturm und Drang for ""Donkey Kong""?  Um...yep.

3005247,4,B000XQ4HR8,"What price will one pay to be the best?  More interestingly, what price will one pay to make everyone else believe that he is the best?  ""The King of Kong"" follows the adventure of Steve Wiebe, a self-proclaimed loser (and more sadly proclaimed as such by loved ones like his mother, wife, and best friend), who wants to do something to show that he is more than the sum of his failures.  His method of demonstration; becoming the world's best Donkey Kong player (what!!??!).  After finding out the high score, held by a supercilious reprobate named Billy Mitchell, Wiebe sets off to conquer the score.  This is when things start getting really weird.

We are introduced to the very strange underworld of competitive classic arcade gaming, where Billy Mitchell is cult leader to a group of sniveling sycophants masquerading as neutral spectators and referees.  At one point early in the movie, Wiebe destroys the top score on his home arcade machine and a couple of Mitchell underlings go to Wiebe's home and take pictures of the computer running the game in an attempt to discredit the score.  They make the case that Mitchell's enemy somehow planted a false computer into the machine and that the score is invalid (I reiterate: what!!??!).  So Wiebe goes to a ""sanctioned"" arcade on the East Coast (despite living in Washington) and beats Michell's high score in front of a live audience (including Mitchell's most reprehensible follower who phones Mitchell throughout to keep him updated).  While this is going on, Mitchell, who was too chicken to meet Wiebe head on despite his macho posturing, has sent a very suspect tape showing a new high score in Donkey Kong.  Despite the questions surrounding both the quality and the timing of the tape, the cult of Mitchell accepts the tape as valid (but won't let Wiebe watch it) and Mitchell regains the record.  Almost a year later, Wiebe goes to Hollywood, Florida (Mitchell's home town) to attempt the record for the Guinness Book of World Records and again, Mitchell cowers from the challenge (yet continues to posture despite his own wife's admission that she had never seen him even play a game).

On the one hand, I root for Wiebe.  He is an everyman.  He works hard, supports his family, and doesn't appear to cause trouble.  He clearly has a void in his heart that he somehow thinks Donkey Kong can fill (or perhaps simply being the best at something can fill).  On the other hand, I fail to understand why someone like Wiebe would waste his time trying to capture Mitchell's crown when there are so many more noble endeavors one with Wiebe's abilities and advantages could undertake.  He fails to see or chooses to ignore the stunted maturity of the competitive gaming community.  His is blinded by his mission; to put his past behind him.  The movie implies that gaining acceptance from this pathetic group of men was a validating experience for him.  I doubt the veracity of that implication and if that is what he gained from this experience, than his odyssey was all for naught.

I hope Wiebe is at peace with himself.  I hope he has exorcised his demons and accepted that despite not being the world's greatest pitcher, musician, basketball player, etc..., that he has a life worth not only living, but cherishing.  But I think the deeper message of this movie is that we live in a culture where the prevailing zeitgeist is that anything short of the best is not only a failure for that particular endeavor, but also makes the person who failed a failure.  Mitchell knows this better than Wiebe and hides his fear of being a failure behind a thin veneer of arrogance.  He knows he cannot live with being a failure at something he used to dominate so he dodges every challenge by Wiebe.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I think most people will enjoy this movie.  The director does not hide his disdain for Mitchell and some of his cronies.  I think he could have explored their point of view a little more instead of simply labeling them obsequious nerds.  This is, however, a minor complaint in an otherwise very enjoyable story that I would otherwise never known about.",1268524800,,4136,4.742657342657343

My main complaint is that the movie makers falsely injected drama into the story by playing loose with the facts, as a little post-movie research revealed.

The film repeatedly showed a graph of the Donkey Kong scores with Billy Mitchell's 1982 score at the top. In fact, Steve Wiebe beat that score in 2003, and when his taped, million-point score was rejected, he was still the official Donkey Kong record holder. Moreover, when Mitchell submitted his own tape, beating Wiebe's new record set at the FunSpot event, it was initially accepted (as shown in the film) but ultimately rejected (omitted from the film), leaving Wiebe as champ.

3005250,5,B000XQ4HR8,"I've decided that I am a total fan of a well-done documentary or mockumentary. Best case scenario for a documentary -- I take away  life enriching information in exchange for a few hours of my time. Worst case scenario -- I'm given great ice breakers or party conversation. Mockumentaries are pretty much pure sarcastic junk food -- tastes so good, won't do much for fuel or brain cell building but delicious anyway.

Best, best case scenario is the documentary that has enough junk food within that the truth is fun enough.

King of Kong has that and more. I'm not even going to pretend to be a gamer, not at all interested in video games, I'm not patient or competitive enough. I would never have picked this one out because of the subject matter. Donkey Kong. Yawn. But a friend brought this little gem over and I couldn't help getting totally caught up in the drama.

Plot basics...the reigning King of Kong earned the title and his fame in the 80's. Building a life, and hairdo, on this monumental platform, he basked in the glory of his records in multiple games. Then comes the challenger, a man driven to conquer and able to rock the King's Mountain.

Throw in the supporting cast, some serious, serious quirkiness and you've got yourself a very memorable few hours. One note. Be forewarned that one particularly over-the-top character turned his record-breaking game win into a Playgirl spread. It's not complete nudity but it is quite a picture and flashes across the screen a few times.

Every moment of this documentary is pure gold, if only because you have to love and admire the amount of obliviousness (or canny sense of self-parody) that would allow the participants to aid in a documentary that so presents everyone involved as clueless, petty, childless, and/or moronic. From the scrappy underdog (who you *will* cheer for, if only because the established opposition is so much more odious), whose toddler son can be heard in the background pleading ""Stop playing Donkey Kong!"" so that his father will come help him in the bathroom, and whose daughter offhandedly points out that, you know, some people ruin their entire lives trying to get into the Guinness Book of World Records... to the established top dog, Billy Mitchell, whose every line positively drips with hilarious self-important haughtiness, to the self-appointed guardians of classic game scores... who are so deeply in bed with Billy Mitchell that they will do just about anything to preserve his status as top game scorer.

It is an absolute *scream* to see the wild-eyed ""tape reviewer"" who reviews the submission tapes rant on about potential cheaters and how he'll stake his life and honor and whatnot on their reputation... except, of course, when it comes to Billy's tapes which are judged automatically authentic immediately, despite frequent tape skips, distortions, and impurities. Indeed, Billy is so trustworthy, that he's on the committee who decides whether or not the people who send in new scores to beat his old scores can ""truly"" be trusted or not. Of course, he's totally fair... I have to bet that Guinness was SO thrilled when this documentary came out, because they're basically on record as saying that this slip-shod organization's word is good enough for their prestigious publishing, ha.

Fans of classic gaming will love this documentary for the fascinating discussions of how and why classic games were as impossibly hard to master as they often were - as well as the interesting programming discussions about the ""kill screen"" when the game code basically just... runs out. Non-gamers will love this documentary for the hilarious personalities on display - really, there's not a single person in this documentary who doesn't take the travails of Donkey Kong (""this machine is *possessed*!"") far, far more seriously than the average viewer will - and the results are nothing short of hilarious.

3005260,5,B000XQ4HR8,"I'm sorry, but Billy Mitchell comes across as a pompous, arrogant, hateful jerk. Here is the inherent problem with the movie. Yes, every good story needs conflict and such, but I recently spoke with someone who knows Billy Mitchell personally. Billy's friend says that Billy is not really like how he was portrayed. I would guess editing really allowed him to be portrayed in a bad light, well, and of course maybe his own words. This is unfortunate. I found myself equating him with all the high school bullies that I ran into. I'm sure this film really hasn't helped him outside of Kong. He appears to do good work with charity, so I want to give him the benefit of the doubt.

The movie itself:
From what viewers will see in the movie: I enjoyed the movie very much, but I come away wishing that this was a friendly competition. Billy never made it friendly. There is one point in the movie where Billy shows up to an arcade that Steve was playing Kong in and Steve says hello to Billy. Billy went out of his way to ignore him and even said on camera to his wife, that there were people he didn't want to talk to. If Billy was such a true winner and as good as he says he is, why not appear and compete in person? I think him sending in a video of breaking the 1,000,000 point mark is rediculous after all the talking he does. This movie leaves me wondering why things played out the way they did and also the validity of Billy Mitchell being employed by Twin Galaxies and being a record holder. This seems like it could be a conflict of interest to me, the viewer.

On the other hand:
Steve Weibe from the very beginning comes across as a nice, humble competitor who just wanted his chance to compete. Steve is the ""hero"" here. He's just down to earth, not arrogant or pretentious. I found myself cheering on Steve and hoping for his success the whole time. I found myself identifying with Steve throughout the film. I think he was a victim in the respect that his board on his home DK Machine was possibly tampered with by another person who has his own issues with Billy. If Steve wasn't very good (because his board was possibly rigged), he wouldn't be second in the world and he wouldn't have been able to achieve that score and kill screen in public on a sanctioned DK machine.

Bottom line, I enjoyed it and wish it was a longer movie. There appears to be several extras that I am looking forward to seeing. I also found all the geeks (judges and others) hillarious. Although I love Donkey Kong, there appears to be people that have made it an obsession which is totally rediculous in the grand scheme of things.

Another problem with the movie: Even the experts cannot pinpoint whether Steve's board was altered. They should have had it sent out to an expert for testing and if it was fine, then let him have the record.

I left the movie wanting more, maybe some kind of resolution to the ""conflict"" between Billy and Steve. I really wanted there to be a face off in the arcade, but we were cheated of this.",1248393600,,3019,4.374331550802139
3005261,5,B000XQ4HR8,"The King of Kong is a lot of things: it's a documentary that chronicles one man's journey to dethrone the nearly 25-year reign of a Donkey Kong champion; it's a classic good vs. evil story set within the weirdest framework you've likely ever seen; it's a way inside the head of a ""gamer,"" which lets us see why so many get so attached to a collection of dots bouncing around on a screen; but first and foremost, it's a movie about the nature of competition and why we drive ourselves to be more than we are.

Steve Wiebe is a talented man. He starred in sports throughout high school and college, plays the drums like a reincarnated Keith Moon, and has a mathematical mind that most people yearn for. He's a great guy with a great family, and yet Steve Wiebe feels like a failure. He is a man who puts enormous pressure on himself to succeed, and he feels like he hasn't given his family the life that he thinks they deserve. Whenever he is down on himself, he retreats to his garage and his old-school Donkey Kong arcade.

Donkey Kong is simple for Steve. It's formulaic, it's controllable, it's simple numbers and patterns. When Steve plays Donkey Kong, he is the master of his own destiny. And he's good at it. He's very good. One day, Steve wonders to himself what the highest Donkey Kong score ever is, and he finds out that it's 874,000, a score that he has beaten many times. The score was set in 1982 by a man named Billy Mitchell, the officially anointed ""Video Game Player of the Century."" The score is registered by an online video game bureau galled Twin Galaxies, the official scorekeepers for all video game high score records. Steve decides to make a tape of his game and send it in.

Steve sends his record-breaking tape to Twin Galaxies, after which he can officially call himself the best Donkey Kong player ever. But when Billy Mitchell gets word that his record has been broken, he does some investigating and discovers that Steve Wiebe has ties to a man who is Mitchell's arch-nemesis, a man who's been accused of sabotaging Mitchell's records in the past. Twin Galaxies sends a man to check out Steve's arcade, and even though they find nothing in the programming or hardware to show that it's been tampered with, they throw out Steve's score and say that it doesn't count, due to suspicion that Wiebe is using an altered arcade. What follows is Steve's attempt to overthrow the duplicitous Mitchell in a series of live tournaments, so as to prove his supremacy once and for all.

The plot, as you might think, sounds absolutely ridiculous. It's an over-dramatization of a meaningless story. But it really isn't. The movie doesn't try to create drama where there isn't any, nor does it paint anyone as someone they're not. Sure, it's biased towards Steve Wiebe, but it should be. This is a man who's trying to prove to himself that he's good at something, the best in the world, in fact, even if it's at something as trivial as Donkey Kong. How many people can say that they're the best in the world at something? He's up against a selfish, arrogant swindler who doesn't make it difficult for the filmmakers to paint him as the bad guy. The story doesn't necessarily pan out the way that you think it will, and it's not necessarily guaranteed that Steve gets the record.

Growing up in the boom of video games in the 80's/early 90's, I'm probably more suited to enjoying this movie than most. However, I don't think that being a fan of games is a prerequisite for enjoying this movie, because I truly don't think that it's about that. It's about proving to yourself that you can achieve something great, and learning never to give up on yourself because every one of us, whether its big or small, can be great at something.",1248307200,,3745,4.5586924219910845
3005262,4,B000XQ4HR8,"Hi there. Alissa here. Born when my father was working at Atari in the early 80's- the only game console I ever owned.

I was lucky enough to see Chasing Ghosts at the LA film festival a couple years ago, prior to seeing King of Kong. I may have given King of Kong 2 stars had I not seen the awesome doc (Chasing Ghosts) detailing the lives of all the guys that made the cover of Time Life and played at the Twin Galaxies arcade in Ottumwa, Iowa- fighting for bragging rights at the 1982 Video Game World Championships. Billy was one of the guys, as well as some of the more minor players in King of Kong. By the time I saw K.O.K. I knew all about these guys and what their lives were like then and now. It's both hilarious and sad and makes King of Kong make soooo much more sense. Why hasn't CHASING GHOSTS been distributed? It should be sold as disc one of a 2 disc set with King of Kong.

Where is Chasing Ghosts? is what I have to say about King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters. Walter (the ref) and another of the players (not Billy) were at the screening... and sadly didn't understand why it was called ""Chasing Ghosts"" (both a pac man reference & one that speaks of looking back on this strange moment of history and the way these men seem to somehow try to cling to it). Which only solidified what the doc was trying to say. Great stuff.",1243468800,,1346,4.153256704980843
3005263,4,B000XQ4HR8,"Like most good documentaries, this is more a story about people and principles than about the topic it explores. So you could have absolutely no interest in (and even an aversion to) video games and still become completely engrossed in this, particularly from the midway point on. That's what happened to me. If it was about Donkey Kong, it would have been ludicrous to me, but instead the game playing was a metaphor for achievement, fairness, justice, and common decency.",1242259200,,473,4.925

I believe Steve addressed any doubts anyone had on his record breaking score and was done in person.  No matter what, Billy Mitchell was given the title because he submitted a video tape. ..something which Billy Mitchell didn't believe in and he said nothing is official if not done live at Twin Galaxies.

Doc...4 stars

3005265,4,B000XQ4HR8,"On one end, this was an excellent movie which really made a good effort to bring the legendary status back to retro arcade games. Over the decades there is no doubt about the fact that games like Donkey Kong, Pac Man, etc. are more than just video games, they are a vital part of our culture. Simple to learn and impossible (for most) to master. Much of the coverage given to many of the enthusiasts, pros and record holders was long overdue. This movie was also able to capture some of the quirky, dorky, ridiculous behavior exhibited by many of the competitors.

  On the other end... well... the depiction of Billy Mitchell as the ""villain"" and Steve Wiebe as the ""victim"" was completely over dramatized and unfair. These film makers took hours and hours of footage and pieced it together into their own little ""Good Guy VS Bad Guy"" reality. If you really pay attention, you may notice that this ""documentary"" is really much closer to a ""reality show"" because of the way that is focuses most of the attention to the drama between the two players. As with any ""reality show"" or drama, it must have a beginning, conflict, climax, resolution and ending, complete with a ""hero"" and a ""villain"". This is the difference between a documentary (based on facts) and a reality show/drama (based on a story).

  I have never met Billy Mitchell personally, but I will say that I used to eat at Rickey's (Billy's restaurant in the movie) at least once a month. I don't even drink but the food & atmosphere is the best in that area. If you look around on the walls in that place, you may notice all of the pictures of the local little league, softball teams etc. and the thousands of dollars that he contributes to the community every year. Billy may be arrogant and (gasp!) ""not perfect like us"" but is not a ""bad guy"" by any stretch of the imagination. Don't believe everything that you see on T.V.

 In the real world Billy is really just a working class stiff like everyone else and not a celebrity. Now imagine if somebody followed YOU around with a camera for days, took all of the footage of you ""acting out"" and then put it all into a film to make you out as a villain, FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. I know that if somebody filmed me playing Halo or GTA, I would look scarier than Charles Manson on a bad hair day. People would be rolling up their car windows and locking their doors when I walked by. All of the hard work spent making a successful business for your family and donating time and effort to the local community would go UNNOTICED because you got COCKY playing DONKEY KONG! FREAKING DONKEY KONG! Seriously you guys. It's a great game and all but gosh... it's just Donkey Kong.

And finally, the real ending to this movie that was conveniently left out... Billy Mitchell IS STILL the King of Kong. He holds the world record again. The fact is that he is STILL the best Donkey Kong player in the world and Steve can't touch his score. Steve got his 15 minutes of fame for being the second best player in the world (which is 15 more than anybody else gets). End of story.",1241827200,2,3076,4.430088495575221
3005266,3,B000XQ4HR8,"The Bottom Line:

It's got a great title and it won't bore you, but The King of Kong commits the number one sin that documentaries can be guilty of--it exaggerates, distorts, and embellishes the trut--and since a ""true story"" is really the primary reason to watch a documentary, that doesn't leave me with much to recommend the film.",1241568000,3,333,4.741379310344827
3005267,4,B000XQ4HR8,"I always find it amazing that people give their consent to appear in films like this, and I can only think of two reasons why they would.  Either they are completely unaware of how they are going to come across on screen, or else the thrill of being filmed overrides any second thoughts.  I don't automatically assume anything about these people one way or another, but a film like this demands oddballs, so it's certainly in the filmmaker's vested interest to make them appear as entertaining as possible, to show them in the worst, or craziest, light.  For someone to blithely hand their image over to that sort of ringmaster seems way too trusting to me.

Even so, 'King of Kong' is an extremely entertaining film, and as I assume no one put words into the participants mouths, the people in the film make the director's job that much easier - if he wants oddballs, all he has to do is keep the camera rolling and the people talking.  Many people interviewed and followed on film have spent a good chunk of their lives mastering classic arcade games, and while it might be tempting to snicker or look down on them for it, the subtle fact the film never raises is that any form of obsessive behavior lends itself to the silent ridicule of a camera's reflection.  It doesn't matter if one builds model trains in their basement or spends 30,000 dollars on a bass boat, desperately trailing after an obsession to the exclusion of any other worthwhile pursuit is just asking to be roasted on the spit of mockery.  Especially when the subjects are vying for the title of 'Best'.

And superficially, that is what 'King of Kong' is about - two two-bit gladiators in search of the official Donkey Kong high score, and the right to inscribe their three letter call sign into the starry sky of the arcade galaxy.  Steve Wiebe, out of a job and in search of meaning and substance in his life, turns his attention instead to Donkey Kong and the decades old high score of that shining beacon of classic arcade game enthusiasts, the ayatollah of rock and rolla, Billy Mitchell.  How these two resolve the contest, and how at first the established gaming community closes ranks around Mitchell when he's challenged is indeed entertaining in a tempest in a teapot sort of way, and especially as a study in human psychology.

But there's a distateful undertone to these people's pursuits too.  The first time Wiebe breaks the record, it's in his garage, and videotaped.  As he creeps nearer to the record, there is a point where his young son has some bathroom issues and needs parental assistance with toilet tissue.  At one point, you can hear the boy crying for his dad, and then scream, ""Please quit playing DONKEY KOOOOOONG!""  It is an excrutiating film moment.

Steve Wiebe makes a statement halfway through the film to the effect that he was only looking for something that could be his, something that would belong to him after missing out on some other goals in life.  From the movie it's clear that he has pretty nice family (and one helluva supportive wife), and it seems sad that he's driven to such an extreme for a rather empty bid at immortality.  I can't condemn him though, as I've had plenty of obsessions myself both in the past and waiting for me in the future.  Except viewing those obsessions through the prism of competitive classic arcade gaming shines a pretty unfavorable light on obsessive behavior of any kind.",1240099200,3,3423,4.656146179401993
3005268,4,B000XQ4HR8,"This documentary started slowly, and I wish my wife had seen it with me so she would appreciate the man she has compared with some of the competitive gamers at the beginning of the film.

""King of Kong"" is like the Sea Biscuit of video game films.  The young unheralded and unlikely West Coast competitor finds real success, and travels across country to chase and challenge the established East Coast titan, and the record book hangs in the balance.  Like in Sea Biscuit, the established champ dodges this newcomer and plays everything to his own advantage.

Somewhere along the line, I became truly invested in challenger Steve Wiebe's quest, and with each growing minute, wanted victory for him more and more.  And the veteran champ Billy Mitchell seems to always be one step ahead, keeping Wiebe from his record.

This was a very well executed documentary, if for no other reason than the fact that there is no way I could identify with the obsession of a competitive gamer, but I was truly cheering for Weibe to somehow overcome the obstacles in his way and win.

The King of Kong is a very intense story about two men who want the title of World Champion of Donkey Kong. The only complaint I have is that the DOC makes Billy Mitchell look almost like a jerk. I seriously doubt he is the mean guy this movie portrays him to be. Still, if you love video games or just love DK, you will very much enjoy this movie. It really is nostalgia for me because I can remember one of the first games I played when I was a kid was the original Donkey Kong and especially DK Junior.

I'll get this out front first: yes, these are real people doing their thing but a lot of this is very contrived and set up for dramatic purposes. The ""good guy"" is made to look even better than what he probably is, and the ""villain"" is made to look like the bad guy so much so it's laughable. I mean, come on, man! It's just tooooo hokey.

I can not begin to describe how much my friends and I laughed while watching this documentary.

Firstly you do not need to know anything about games, this isn't about the actual games themselves anyone can enjoy this.

The premise is this Billy Mitchell set a Donkey Kong high score record in 1982 which wasn't beaten for 20 or so years, enter the underdog Steve Wiebe who simply picked Donkey Kong on a whim to try to get a high score in his spare time.
He tirelessly practices and video tapes his winning score only to be investigated and denied his record.

This is where the controversy heats up and a series of competitions follow to find the ultimate winner with twist and turns allong the way.

3005275,4,B000XQ4HR8,"Let me first say this. This documentary is really good. I thought it was gonna be more funny than it was (though it IS funny), but it really does capture your attention.

Back in the 80's, TIME magazine had an article about some of the best players of video games in America. Centipede, Joust, Pac-Man...all the greats were there. And Donkey Kong. One of the hardest games ever made. And Billy Walsh was the King of that barrel throwing ape. He destroyed the scoreboards with a score of 800k+. Over 300K from 2nd place. It was ridiculous. The man had been on top of that game since 1986.

And then comes along a Steve Weibe who caught a slight case of the OCD (heh). Steve beats the score, but it's a taped score, so the judges that take in tapes at Twin Galaxies, aren't to sure if this wasn't a hoax or a trick or just downright cheating.

Now this is where I begin to say ""Holy Crap... these nerds are ruthless!"" Supposedly this one guy self nicknamed ""Mr. Awesome"" has the top score for missile command but Twin Galaxies won't give him credit for it. So he is at war basically with Billy Walsh. So he helped out Steve with a card for his Donkey Kong machine, which made the Twin Galaxy officials think it's a rigged board. I was seriously sitting on my couch laughing out how almost fake this is...but it's all true.

So to prove his worth Steve plays live and once again breaks the record all the while having a lackey (yes...a dang lackey who thinks he's a protg) of Billy Walsh standing behind him making comments and you just KNOW he's trying to get under Steve's skin. I even caught myself saying out loud to the TV to 'STFU MAN!' Then there is scandal after scandal. Tapes. No Show's. The Guinness Book of World Records. Good vs Evil.
ALL OVER A TOP SCORE OF A DONKEY KONG GAME!

For a moment I thought I was watching a highschool girl chick flick because in one scene Steve shows up to a restaurant owned by Billy Walsh and some of the gaming dudes there were saying stuff ""omg...I can't believe he's here. He just invited himself here."" Seriously guys? It's a public restaurant. Not your D&D JOLT infused gaming nights in your mom's basement.

3005276,4,B000XQ4HR8,"The King of Kong does the amazing feat of creating a fascinating film about competing for high scores in a retro video game. More than a study of a subculture - a benevolent study at that, when it would be so easy to poke fun at its subjects - it is a classic David vs. Goliath story, an incredibly likable family man who has always come up second challenging the arrogant, self-righteous champion. And that champion, Billy Mitchell, is so easy to loathe, comparing himself to Joan of Ark and constantly referencing his winning nature, that half the fun of this movie is simultaneously laughing at him and despising him.

It's clear who to root for here - and I know that there's some controversy surrounding this, Mitchell fans saying that the documentary doesn't properly tell the truth, making Wiebe (our David) look better and Mitchell look worse, and perhaps that's true.

3005277,5,B000XQ4HR8,"Admit it -- a film about two guys locked in a titanic stuggle to become the world champion of Donkey Kong just invites parody. This battle of the geekoids -- new against old, cocky champion against hopeful challenger -- is worthy of a smarmy Hollywood farce.  But the charcters that director Seth Gordon has captured in ""The King of Kong"" are very real and very commited to their hobby. The craf involved in the story is a matter of smart editing, not of clever writing.

When it came to enjoying this film, it didn't hurt that my family lives within easy driving of Weirs Beach, NH, where some of the action in this film takes place. We visited Funspot just last weekend, and saw the very machines recorded in the film. The place is real, the competitors are real and the competition is real. It's hard to imagine a more fascinating battle, with more different competitors. Champion Bobby Mithell has held the Donkey Kong title since 1982. He has parlayed his notoriety into a successful hot sauce business. With his BeeGee's era beard and blow-dried do, he clearly thinks more than a little about himself. His competitor, Steve Wiebe, is a schlumpy Seattle dad and science teacher -- the kind of guy with lot of talent who has never quite hit the big time in spite of his enormous ambitions to succeed. He finally finds his niche in playing Donkey Kong. Buying his own game, he maps the game's dozens of screens, mastering moves that he hopes will give him the success that has always just barely eluded him. Though their sympathies are clearly with Wiebe, the filmmakers never let on how the contest will come out until the end.

Congratulations to the makers of ""The King of Kong"" for letting this small, strange demimonde of players, wannabes and self-styled referees speak for itself.

3005279,5,B000XQ4HR8,"This movie should be required viewing in any college level sociology class. The film documents a man who would struggle to actually be an outcast in any social group attempting to penetrate a clique of individuals who have likely been outcasts their entire lives.

Steve Wiebe is almost painfully average.  He's a middle-class school teacher who'd been an above average athlete and he plays a couple of musical instruments.  He has a good-looking wife and could be a poster boy for suburban America.  He also has an almost preternatural ability to play Donkey Kong, and therein lies the trouble.

In order to have his record-breaking score recognized, Steve has to break through and enter into a world of people who probably weren't two-sport athletes and certainly couldn't mingle well at an office Christmas party.  In getting his score validated, too, he will be bringing down their king.

Billy Mitchell is the undisputed monarch of these gamers.  I'd first read about him in a 2006 article in the now-defunct Oxford American magazine.  In that article, the author, David Ramsey, tried to convey Mitchell's cockiness but still be respectful.  After this film, I have a new degree of respect for Mr. Ramsey's restraint.

Mitchell is, rightfully, recognized as Gamer of the Century.  He's sort of law and order in this world in that he is uniquely qualified to challenge all high score claims.  Mitchell is also a successful business man and he's married to a woman who you will not admit is hot in front of your wife, but men get it.  Mitchell's success in business and marriage, though, does not tarnish or diminish his status among the gamers.  In fact, they likely cheer him on.  You expect your hero to do well in all endeavors.

When Weibe submits his score, it's obvious that the Twin Galaxies crowd is eager to close ranks and protect their hero.  Weibe is left with no option but to demonstrate his skills in person.  He has to physically play the game surrounded by these outcasts who are so galvanized they have actually become snobs in their own right.  There seems to be several instances where they are trying to distract this interloper during his game-play, with Billy Mitchell himself doing a silent walk-by.  The crux of it is, here's Weibe, a guy who could be anybody's best bud and fit in anywhere, being shunned by folks who've probably been kept at a distance all their lives.

The extra features, particularly the extended interviews, are almost better than the movie itself.  The players describing Burger Time are the greatest thing I've seen on film in a while.  Interesting commentaries, too.

Anyone old enough to remember arcades needs to watch this film.  Beware, though, you'll find yourself with an almost uncontrollable urge to prowl e-bay for old games.",1215907200,14,2789,4.8808510638297875

Both men are trying to get and keep the best scores possible for the classic Nintendo arcade game Donkey Kong. Billy Mitchell is the current champion in the movie. Billy has held top scores in many classic arcade games over the years; Donkey Kong being the last title he held onto. Steve Wiebe, currently a Science teacher, decides he has plenty of time to challenge for the highest score possible in Donkey Kong; after he finds him self laid off by Boeing. The movie almost seems to good to be true. Steve Wiebe, being the nicest of nice guys. The prototype of a good father and husband. Against the brash, and often times rude for no real reason, Billy Mitchell. The movie mainly follows Steve Wiebe, in his quest for the title. Billy Mitchell is featured in many segments, but mainly as a protagonist. Billy makes claims of being the best and makes a comment to the effect That To Be The Best, You Have To Play Live. Playing Live in front of a crowd being the only way to truly prove you are the best. This comment is the basis for the entire movie. Steve Wiebe flies all over the US showing off his skills, all in the hopes of being recognized as the best Gamer. While Billy tries his best to avoid him. In a deleted scene on the DVD, you get to see a comparisons of both men's game play. While Billy mainly uses hammers to destroy objects to gain maximum points, Steve uses tricks to adjective his best scores. Like jumping up and down on certain platform stages to get extra bonus points. These differences give some room for an argument on who is truly best, because while both men are adjectiving top scores, both men are doing it in different ways. So who is better? The game player, or the person that finds the loopholes? Both men are by far some of the best gamers on Earth, so respect has to go to given to both of them. As of 2008, Billy Mitchell holds the top scores for Donkey Kong, but Steve has not given up on reclaiming his top scores.
This movie is very enjoyable. I have seen it both on DVD and on G4. It is not a movie I can get bored of. So if you are into video games, even if you don't play the classics's, King of Kong is still right for you. I didn't want to write too much in the way of reviewing the core storyline, because I don't think I review should give away the entire movie.

He had 800,000 points, and that my friends is quite a bit of busted barrels and fallen monkeys.

It turns out that The King of Kong is a wonderful underdog film.  Steve Weibe is portrayed as a likeable everyman who just happens to have a knack for the extreme patience and analytical skill to get such a score. He is described by his family as a savant in some respects but he seems like a relatively normal guy. As a fellow-gamer, I will concede that it takes some work to do what both these guys have done.  On the other side of the coin, we get the sub-culture's heroic golden boy Billy Mitchell.  Billy is portrayed as the villainous and elitist coward and I get the feeling that he didn't get a fair shake from our documentarian Seth Gordon, but I can't be sure.  Billy has a charisma and bravado that will turn most people off, but in his own culture he is the man and his big old mullet is indeed very cool.  He is very successful far beyond his game-playing however, owning his own restaurant and homemade line of hot sauces.  He is the ""Sauce King"" of Florida.  I actually liked Billy but most viewers are going to hate him.  Then again, I almost always root for the villain in these formulaic good vs. evil kind of films.  The people I really didn't like were his toadies and minions who seemed to support Billy and undermine Steve consistently throughout.

There are great characters in this movie.  In addition to Steve and Billy we have Walter Day; the referee and founder of Twin Galaxies, a small arcade that evolved into an organization that tracks video game world records.  Walter is also a songwriter and provides some surreal impromptu folk singing.  Steve Saunders is the old nemesis of Billy who was handedly defeated by the Donkey Kong prodigy 25 years ago.  He is now one of Billy's friends, who in many ways come off more as disciples.  Brian Kuh for example is portrayed as the quintessential Billy Mitchell toady.  He has played Donkey Kong with great enthusiasm as well and put up some very high scores, but he is humbled in person by Weibe's gaming chops.  Brian walks around the arcade containing his jealously with this bizarrely awkward disposition that was one of the film's highlights for me.  He just couldn't wait for Billy to come along and take this guy's score out!  Another character is Roy Shildt or Mr. Awesome.  Mr. Awesome is a fitness guru and a self-proclaimed pickup artist.  Well, where else would one find such a person but in the underworld of classic arcade gaming?  Mr. Awesome is one of Billy's hated rivals and he is accused of unfairly assisting Steve in his quest to shatter Billy's record.

Anyway, the fascinating thing about this film is that it does come off as formulaic in some respects but that is just fine with me because it is coverage of real life.  I'm sure that the editing favored Steve Weibe, but that is because there was a really fun and interesting story to tell within Gordon's footage.  I obviously loved this movie and I would guess that anyone who has any interest in this kind of thing would as well but my wife, who has rarely if ever played any video games, loved it too.

Billy Mitchell comes off as some delusional geek that thinks he is some sort of god!

3005285,3,B000XQ4HR8,"EDIT: I changed the title of my review, and gave it three stars instead of 1 (which has a bit harsh in retrospect).  Below is my original, unedited review.

I watched ""King of Kong"" on G4 today, and I came away with pretty strong feelings about ""Twin Galaxies"" and Billy Mitchell.  If you watch the ""documentary"" (I use the term loosely), you'll know who I'm talking about.  Anyway, I was so affected by the film that I ordered a copy of the DVD and the soundtrack from Amazon right after watching it.

Then the ugly truth...

I went to Wikipedia to learn more, as I often do with something I become interested in.  I read the section entitled ""Disputed facts"", and was beginning to feel misled by the movie.  After following a link from the article's footnotes (to the ""Official Statement"" regarding inaccuracies in the movie on the ""Twin Galaxies"" forums), I learned some disturbing information.  The more I read, the more I realized this movie completely misrepresents the whole situation.  It villainizes Billy Mitchell (who admittedly is a somewhat cocky individual) and people who are affiliated with ""Twin Galaxies"".  The worst part is the news media picked up on the story and continues to spread mistruth.  On top of that, most viewers will probably never realize the truth about the situation.

What a total burn.  Shame on the producers of this film.  What a bunch of hypocrites portraying Billy Mitchell as a coward and a fraud.  The real fraud is a so-called documentary entitled ""The King of Kong"".

It is almost charming.
It would be charming, if there weren't a dark side. (Most telling, a young girl, perhaps the most mature person in this documentary, says these records must be important because people ruin their lives to get them.)
Central to this film is the rivalry between two Donkey Kong Kings. There is the established star; there is the outsider. There is the challenge. . .I won't spoil it. . .
Most central to my interest in this film was the personalities of the two gamers. Years ago, there was a memorable baseball article in ""Sports Illustrated"" about Pete Rose, hit king of baseball, and his son, Pete Rose, Jr., a ball player who struggled to get out of the minor leagues. Junior, the article said, would never be 1/100 the ball player his father was. However, the writer added: Rose would never be 1/100 the man his son is.
That summarizes the two main gamers of this film: one is the star; the other is the gentleman.

In contrast, Billy Mitchell, the long time record holder, comes across as an arrogant jerk who will stop at nothing to maintain his position as the ""King Of Kong"".

Director Seth Gordon does a fine job spinning this tale of ""good vs evil"".But he never loses sight of the absurdity of the conflict, with touches of comedic irony mixed in with the all too real human emotions on display.

Eccentric characters like Walter Day and the self-proclaimed ""Mr Awesome"" add to the film's charm, though there isn't anyone besides Steve and his family that I would personally want to hang out with. I especially enjoyed the soundtrack, including the hilarious use of Survivor's ""Eye Of The Tiger"" and Leonard Cohen's brillant ""Everybody Knows"".

King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters is the documented story of Steve Wiebe's attempts to attain the Donkey Kong world record. In addition to being very informative about classic arcade games, their champions, and their programming, it carries with it a heart-warming tale of triumph over adversity.

The story begins with a brief history lesson about how video game records began and how they were recorded. We meet Billy Mitchell, a controversial gamer who has held several gaming world records over the last few decades and who was the current Donkey Kong champion. Enter Steve Wiebe (pronounced wee-bee), a soft-spoken family man who has always tried his hardest, but always seemed to be beaten down by forces out of his control. Wiebe has one goal in mind, to be the Donkey Kong world champion, and he knows he can do it.

A veritable host of kooky characters show up, most friends of reigning champ Mitchell, and the contest turns from a friendly competition into an all-out brawl for the title.

This is one the the finest documentaries I've watched in a very long time - on par with the likes of Supersize Me and the very controversial, but well written, SiCK0. It'd be nice to see an update to this at some point, as the tides have changed since it was filmed in 2005.

3005295,5,B000XQ4HR8,"The King of Kong is a documentary about the guys who battled (yes, battled is the right word) to be recognized for the world record score on Donkey Kong.  It's a great movie because it'll keep you riveted to the disaster that is the main character's lives and how they are dominant and famous in only an isolated group.  Fame for Minutia - the American Way.

We are a nation obsessed by Fame.  The entertainment and sports sections are more read than the front page.  The political races are only interesting when celebrities like Clinton and Obama clash.  Britney Spears is a ratings juggernaut despite her debilitating pyschological defects.  Paris Hilton is also a marketing genius despite her inability to pass any math or grammar test in our public schools.  Celebrity, fame, and notoriety drive more money and more effort than anything else in America.  Or so it seems.

Billy The celebrity in the King of Kong is this one guy, Billy Mitchell, who held records in the classic video games, Donkey Kong and Centipede.  In 1999 Billy Mitchell performed a perfect game of Pac-Man, an unheard of act.  He's a self-promoter, a guru of hot sauce for the Chicken Wing industry and a restauranteer in Hollywood, Florida.  In this little circle of people who closely follow classic video game records, Billy is the most widely recognized person and he revels in his fame, flaunting it as if he were the Emperor of San Francisco.  He's an ass.  He graces video arcades with his presence and phone calls as if they should be grateful and loyal just to know him.

The movie is about upstart Steve Wiebe, an unlucky guy from Washington who'd never made his mark in any facet of his life despite working hard and with dedication.  He sought to make his mark in Donkey Kong and Billy Mitchell sought to thwart him.

3005297,4,B000XQ4HR8,"""The King of Kong"" is a classic look at good vs. evil as Steve Wiebe challenges Billy Mitchell for the Donkey Kong title that Mitchell has held for years. Wiebe comes across as a lovable, devoted family man who starts playing Donkey Kong when he loses his job and who just wants to be a winner for once. Mitchell comes across as a bit arrogant, wanting to hold on to his title as champ, refusing to meet with Wiebe in a face to face challenge, even as he emphasizes the importance of ""live"" scores.

""The King of Kong"" is a fascinating look into the world of classic game competition. You can't help but end up cheering for Wiebe and hating Mitchell as the movie goes along. This is partly due to the somewhat controversial editing that shows Wiebe at home, surrounded by family, trying and failing to meet with Mitchell, and willing to show up in public to challenge the title. On the other hand, you only catch brief glimpses inside Mitchell's home, an even briefer glimpse of his wife, and when he does meet up with Wiebe, he basically ignores him.  His unwillingness (at least at that time of the documentary) to defend his record in public is perplexing, especially since he stresses throughout the documentary how important it is to do it ""live"". His sending a videotape of him setting a record in Donkey Kong to Funspot while Wiebe is competing live is one of the more infuriating things he does in the documentary as is Walter Day's decision to use the score on the tape even though he had questions about the tape (to be fair, ""The King of Kong"" neglects to mention that Mitchell's score was soon taken down).

What makes ""The King of Kong"" so interesting is how important the record in Donkey Kong is to both Wiebe and Mitchell. It's clear that Mitchell loves the ""fame"" that comes with the title of Donkey Kong champ. But Wiebe is no less determined to gain the title, sometimes almost neglecting his children (the scene with him first breaking the score is both funny and sad as his children struggle to gain his attention). His young daughter has perhaps the most telling line in the documentary: ""I never knew that the Guinness World Record Book was so... I never knew it was so important... Some people sort of ruin their lives to be in there."" Also interesting are some of the other players who are also competing on various games (I would have loved to see more of the late Doris Self, the oldest video game competitor, who once set a world record in Q-Bert). The scene where Wiebe reaches a kill screen in Donkey Kong shows just how exciting competition can be not just to those playing the game, but those playing other games as well.

""The King of Kong"" is a good, if not perfect documentary. The film plays with facts a little too much - the producers not only omit the bit about Mitchell's high score being quickly taken down, but the fact that Wiebe was not the first to seriously challenge Mitchell's records, there had been an earlier much disputed, record breaking score. The film also neglects to mention that even though Mitchell made it into the 2007 Guiness World Records for the highest score in Donkey Kong, Wiebe also is listed in Guinness for the highest score in Donkey Kong, Jr. There is also some dispute as to whether Wiebe and Mitchell did meet up, especially in a restaurant scene that is edited to look like Mitchell is avoiding Wiebe; and what exactly happened when people came to Wiebe's house to examine his Donkey Kong machine. Oddly enough, these omissions and disputed facts only serve to make the move even more interesting.

The movie turns into a conspiracy flick, when the disciples of Mitchell do everything they can to discredit the record and send Wiebe home.  But Wiebe has the courage to attempt to set the record in public, and even goes so far as to travel to Mitchell's back yard to get it done.

To watch Mitchell move competing hot sauce products on the shelves of a market to make more room for his own is a good encapsulation of the person portrayed in the video. Shifting things around while no one else is looking to make himself look better.  Equivalent to having his lapdog play the video while the good guy is busting his rear trying to win the record LIVE.

The superb documentary, ""The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters"" takes us to a strange and fascinating world in which otherwise reasonable, responsible adults compete to become the high scoring champions of such video arcade classics as Pac Man, Ms. Pac Man, Asteroids, and, of course, the inimitable Donkey Kong.

Seth Gordon's film focuses on two key players in the field - Billy Mitchell, who has held the high-scoring record for Donkey Kong since 1982, and Steve Wiebe, who, in 2005 (the time of the movie), was threatening to knock Mitchell off his throne.  The movie is mainly about Wiebe's obsession with challenging Mitchell to a competition and Mitchell's dodging Wiebe's efforts at virtually every turn.  Like a true king who has long enjoyed the privileges and trappings and sense of entitlement that come with royalty, Mitchell is clearly not one who will abdicate easily.

At first, it seems as if the movie is going to be just another tale of quirky obsession in a niche area that the majority of us know little or nothing about.  Yet, a funny thing happened to this movie on its way to completion. It found its own unforeseen drama in the nature of the two protagonists.  When they began making their documentary, the filmmakers clearly had no intention of making one of their subjects a ""hero"" and the other a ""villain,"" but, thanks to the actions of each of the men, that is exactly how things eventually turned out.  For Wiebe emerges as a pretty decent guy overall, a bit obsessed with the game perhaps (as, indeed, any person bucking for the title of world champion would have to be), but a comparatively modest, hardworking family man who is treated rather shabbily by the official record keepers of the sport, Twin Galaxies (though they do tend to redeem themselves somewhat at the end).  The many comments from Wiebe's supportive wife, Nicole, and others who know him, go a long way towards humanizing his character.  Mitchell, on the other hand, comes across on camera as a real jerk, a conceited individual more concerned with maintaining his record than engaging in open and honest competition with a potential rival.  It is this unexpected turn into insightful character study that gives the film its special added kick.

Beyond its probing of obsession and competition on an individual level, the movie also lays bare the complex political dynamics that take place behind the scenes and away from the competitions themselves.  We see the manipulation that goes into deciding which scores to validate and which to not, as well as the ""boys' club"" mentality that favors established stars like Mitchell over upstart newcomers to the scene like Wiebe.  In fact, Wiebe spends most of his time in the film simply trying to get some of his record scores accepted by Twin Galaxies.

""The King of Kong"" would make an impressive double feature with ""Air Guitar Nation,"" yet another study of a fringe world filled with obsessive/compulsive players and cutthroat competition.  In a year rife with impressive documentaries, ""The King of Kong"" is clearly one of the best.",1203206400,3,3095,4.911708253358925
3005306,5,B000XQ4HR8,"I stuck this movie into the DVD player thinking I'd watch 15 minutes or so and then go make dinner.  Before I knew it, the end titles were coming up.  This movie starts out slowly and you think it's going to be for hard-core gamers only and then it just sucks you in.

The first time you see Billy Mitchell on screen, standing in front of a copy machine wearing a button up shirt and tie, hair unfashionably long and blunt cut, with facial hair right out of the 70s, your first thought is ""loser.""  Some of this comes from the popular image of people who are hard-core game players as not having real lives.  It comes a surprise, therefore, to find out that not only is Mitchell a world champion video gamer, he is an exceptionally successful business person who is married and has children.  Nevertheless, this doesn't stop him from coming across as a world-class jerk.  While this is no doubt due somewhat to editing, no one put words into Mitchell's mouth and after a while you'll want to roll your eyes at his pompous pontificating.  Still, he's the rock star of video gamers and the world-record holder in Donkey Kong, and even if you think that people who spend that much time going after such a seemingly useless world record need to get a life, you can't argue with the fact that Billy Mitchell certainly seems to have one, even if you'd never want to be part of it.

Steve Wiebe, on the other hand, is one of those guys you'd love to have as your best friend.  Just as no amount of editing could make Billy Mitchell into the jerk he obviously is, no amount of editing in a picture this long could make Steve Wiebe out to be such a good guy if he weren't genuinely good natured.  Even when the video gaming world seems to be conspiring against him to make sure that Billy Mitchell stays on top, Wiebe has a smile on his face.  He's smart, good-looking, talented, and also married and a father.  And such a sap that times, you just want to slap him for putting up with everything with such good grace.

The movie is about Wiebe's attempt to break Mitchell's long-standing world record for the highest ever Donkey Kong score.  Those of us old enough to have played the game back in its heyday will remember how fun it was as well as its sheer impossibility.  But even if you never played, or if that funny looking little guy dodging fireballs and falling barrels while trying hopelessly to rescue the girl never appealed to you, chances are you'll find this movie delightful.  Because this movie is not about a video game, it's about what drives us to keep going in the face of the odds.  The filmmakers do a great job of eliciting from the participants, particularly Wiebe, the reasons for their attraction to the game and the pursuit of the all time high score.  Actual gameplay is kept to a minimum, which is frustrating for those of us who really liked the game, but what keeps it interesting even for people who've never held a joystick.  Even if you think such a pursuit is really stupid, you'll probably find yourself torn when Steve Wiebe has to choose between breaking the world record and wiping his young son's bottom.  You really end up rooting for him.

The supporting players are almost as entertaining as Wiebe and Mitchell, especially Walter Day, the folksinging, meditating, self-appointed guru of the gaming world, who seems to be going out of his way to keep Billy Mitchell on top.  Seriously, you couldn't invent this guy.

Seth Gordon, the director of this film, worked on the movie New York Doll, and he seems to have picked up some of that film's ability to transcend the subject matter and keep us interested in people who might not otherwise seem like anyone we'd want to watch for a couple of hours.  That Gordon can make Donkey Kong into a metaphor for life, and an entertaining one at that, is no mean accomplishment.  I loved this movie.",1203033600,98,3872,4.503576537911302

He's out of work and can't afford a new Donkey Kong board when his breaks down, so Mr. Awesome buys him one?  Then why is he playing Donkey Kong instead of spending his time finding a job?  Watching this, I couldn't help but feel sorry for his wife and two young children. Also, watching this documentary I couldn't help but think ""Does anyone really care who has the highest score on a video game that's 27 years old now?""  Billy Mitchell has got to be the biggest jerk of all time!  Brian Kuh is even more pathetic than he is and worships Billy like some kind of god.

The film really did a big disservice to Billy Mitchell by pulling a 'Michael Moore' and twisting/mainpulating certain scenes and events in order to make Mitchell out to be the bad guy. (I won't go into details here because there is not adequate space, but you can Google the movie and read all about it if you're curious.)

This was obviously done for dramatic effect, but when you're slamming somebody and calling their character into question by intentionally misleading the audience, that's not cool. Note that I have no affiliations with Billy and have never met him. However, I know several people who have met him (at the classic gaming expo events), and they say although he can be a little arrogant, he's a real nice guy and nothing like what the film shows.

The only other person I didn't hate in this movie was Mitchell's friend who seemed like a fair and ok guy. His biggest fault is being friends with that creep.

The other reviewers sum it fairly well, so I'll just pile on with another positive review.  I will say it is so much more than just a movie for 80's video game addicts.

For parents - the movie is rated PG-13 for ""brief sexual reference"".  This consists of a 20 second scene about 27 minutes into the movie where ""Mr. Awesome"" says a few derogatory words and shows a couple near-naked pictures of himself.  I watched the movie with my 9 year old son, and the scene passed right by with no problems.  Other than that, I don't recall any swearing or inappropriate content.  However, in the bonus features of the disk, there is a longer version about ""Mr. Awesome"" that is quite a bit more inappropriate, so just be on the lookout for that bonus segment if watching with the kids.  My son loved the film, and now he has an appreciation for the games I grew up with and the skill it takes to master them.

3005314,5,B000XQ4HR8,"Steve Wiebe just wants to win, at something, anything, and knows he has everything it takes but a little bit of self-confidence and a cause to fight for.  He finds that cause in his quest to master Donkey Kong -- allegedly the most challenging of all the classic video games.  The problem is that reigning champion Billy Mitchell is not about to give up his title as the King of Kong -- one of the last remaining crowns upon which he's staked his reputation and his ego.  The first record set by Steve is challenged on legal grounds -- with the suggestion that he must have tampered with his machine.  His new challenge is to set the record straight, in public and in person -- but Billy is just too slick to put his record on the line without a few tricks up his sleeve.

This is really as good as it gets in documentary territory -- fun, funny, heartbreaking, tense, exciting, enraging.  It's all there -- and what is so quirky and odd is that the stakes can be so high in what appears on the face of it to be the most trivial of contests.  It is rare that a documentarian can find a protagonist as likeable and worthy but down on his luck as Steve Wiebe and an antagonist as devious and clever and diabolical as his weaselly slick archnemesis Jedi from the darkside Billy Mitchell.  For a match of similar proportions you'd almost have to look to Michael Moore's Roger and Me -- except for the sneaking suspicion during that film that it's really Mike who is playing Jedi mind tricks.",1202169600,6,1487,4.381818181818182

Just ask the legions of retro arcade gamers and enthusiasts throughout the world if there is one game that TRULY stands the test of time in its game design and challenge level and Donkey Kong will quickly rise to the top of the list.  Still challenging and still fun after all these years Miyamoto's masterpiece becomes the center of an unlikely documentary.  There is a protagonist and an antagonist, there is turmoil and there are hardships, this is 2 very different mens story as they attempt to master the machine know as KONG.
Director Seth Gordon doesn't get in the way of his subject matter with too many technical tricks he lets the game and the men speak for themselves.  By the end of King of Kong you will look at videogames and the electronic athletes who play them in a whole new light and you might find yourself trying to best one of TWIN GALAXIES high scores yourself.
A fascinating study in what makes the human animal such a competitive and obsessive beast we also see the softer side of humanity in the oddly touching real life character of WALTER DAY, enthusiast and official referee for videogame high scores he is like an enlightened champion for all the pale and sallow geeks who have risked their health for HIGH SCORES.  This DVD is packed with highly entertaining extras that go on and on, my favorite is the I AM 8 Bit section with art and music inspired by and from the 8 bit era. The extended interviews are fascinating overall, listening to 2 gamers break down the facts and frustration in Burgertime is one the most hilarious discussions about gaming I have ever seen.  I am not surprised in the slightest that this is becoming a MAJOR MOTION PICTURE next as hollywood has a BRAIN SUCKER hand over its head, and it is ""starving"".  Next to NO END IN SIGHT this is without a doubt the best DOCUMENTARY I saw in 2007.

3005319,4,B000XQ4HR8,"""The King of Kong"" follows the 2004-2006 rivalry and resulting controversy for the title of Donkey Kong Champion between longtime record holder and Gamer of the Century Billy Mitchell and challenger Steve Wiebe. Wiebe is cast in the role of heroic underdog, a junior high school science teacher from Washington state who has chosen Donkey Kong as the vehicle of his success after a series of disappointments in other fields. When Wiebe's videotaped record-breaking game is rejected by Twin Galaxies, the regulatory organization for classic arcade records, Steve is forced to try to break the record live, with referee Walter Day as a witness. Meanwhile, defending champion Billy Mitchell, a hot sauce mogul from Florida, avoids the challenge of his rival for fear of losing his title.

I didn't realize that the interest in retro arcade games is still so intense, as I haven't seen hide nor hair of one of these machines since the 1980s. Director Seth Gordon has fashioned a story from a competition that takes place in front of video game screens by focusing on the characters and the controversy. He digs into Steve Wiebe's past to find motivation, accurate or not, for his obsessive pursuit of the Donkey Kong title. Billy Mitchell is portrayed as a egomaniac who tries to manipulate Twin Galaxies' acceptance of challengers' scores. His fear of defeat after 20 years on top is understandable, even if his actions are not admirable. I have no interest in video games, but ""The King of Kong"" is a character drama that is at once compelling and curious.

The DVD (New Line 2008): Bonus features include 10 bonus scenes, 11 extended interviews, a DVD-ROM (Windows only), a theatrical trailer (2 min), a Glossary of 12 arcade terms, 2 feature commentaries, and: ""The Saga Continues"" updates us on the rivalry for the Donkey Kong title since 2006. ""A Really, Really Brief History of Donkey Kong"" (1 min) is a fast-talking animated history of the game. ""I am 8-bit"" is a gallery of 18 frames of a group art project, with music, inspired by classic arcade games. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish.

The first feature commentary is by the filmmakers. Director Seth Gordon, producer Ed Cunningham, and associate producer Clay Tweel tell us how they discovered the story, how different parts of the film were conceived, and provide additional history of the people and relationships in the film. The second feature commentary is by Chris Carlyle, entertainment editorial director for IGN, and Jon M. Gibson, founder of ""i am 8-bit"". This is a conversational, often joking commentary about the people in the film. I'd skip it.",1201910400,25,2644,4.963882618510158

Not modern day gamers sitting and playing on Xbox 360's, Nintendo Wii's, or even Playstation 3's.  Nope, old fashioned, retro style arcade gaming.

Gaming on stand-up arcade systems, or table gaming systems.  Gamers that played (and still play) on the late 1970's and 1980's type gaming systems.  Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-man, Donkey Kong, Battlezone, Robotron and other systems.

King of Kong relates the story of one player that quested for recognition of his score on Donkey Kong by the official recorders of world records for such events.  At the same time the movie offers up a tale of a system that seems to favor the originally recognized record holder for the game.

Can the challenger knock off the champ?  If he does, will the accomplishment be acknowledged?

I LOVED this film. Not only did I love the fact that there are people out there like this, it also made me reflect fondly about how great some of these games are. It's easy to discredit games like Pac-Man, Frogger and Donkey Kong in an era of Resident Evil, Soul Caliber and Halo. It their core the classic 80's games are simplistic in nature. But they are F-U-N.

And like those games this film is fun. It's put together perfectly and with a love for the 80's games. The music for the soundtrack is well chosen. The characters are interesting and depressing all at the same time. It's a short, wonderful film about discovering yourself and realizing it's never to late to get good at something. I was so impressed by this movie, that upon my original viewing (a rental DVD), I purchased it today at Best Buy and e-mailed the director to tell him what a great job he did.

The only thing in my life that I can relate this to is when my cousin unplugged the Atari while I was killing at Asteroids. I was 13, and I think I got very mad for about 8 minutes. Maybe 9.

The most troubling thing about this video is not what these people are attempting to do but rather their scruples, lack of them, or the nerdy lackeys that run around doing bigger nerds bidding. The way they look (bad hair, bad beards, bad dress) and the way the 80s have never seemed to end for them is good for a hoot. Billy Mitchell is depicted as some sort of evil nerd on high. In his former life he was probably some sort of carnival barker, wizard behind the curtain, puppet master pulling everyones strings for a laugh.

Steve is essentially Lightening McQueen and Billy Mitchell is Chick Hicks. Go watch Pixars Cars and you will see what I mean. Integrity, being likable, and being a stand up guy with a stand up personality is, in the end, more important than any score on some video screen. I hope Steve realizes that.

Why they use VHS instead of hard drives, live streaming video, DVDs or just play live is anyones best guess. It's a small bizarre community.

Steve's wife (and family) is perhaps the best woman, no, make that the best lady on the planet. I thought my wife was understanding. WOW! Give Steve's wife a cigar. Give her a mansion!

So if you are here reading this then you need no convincing to watch this. It's a good documentary, even thought it's also a bit sad.  Crumb, Crazy Love, and documentaries like them are similar in scope to this. Bizarre, small circles of people, in a zone, planet, world all their own. Aren't we all.

it is easy to watch it and be convinced that bill mitchell is a bad guy to some degree. that is simply not true. the movie uses clever cutting and leaves out some important moments to guide the viewer into a mindset that billy is a megalomaniac. you can easily look on the internet and find numerous sites and posts that spell out scene by scene things that were ommitted and give differing points of view that show billy is not a monster.

That pathos we all experience makes King of Kong one of the most satisfying experiences I've had going to the movies in a long time.",1196121600,,490,4.455555555555556
3239533,5,B000XQ4HR8,"I've seen a lot of so-called comedies in the past few years but not one comes close to the truth-is-funnier-than-fiction genius in King of Kong.

The director understands the documentary form well and lets it work for itself. The story unfolds quickly and slyly and the two main characters (and characters they are) are brought to life, and then some. I laughed out loud again and again and again at the endless irony in this flick, at what it says about where we are as a culture and a species, and at the perfect silliness of it all.

Mr. Blow Dry and his little world are so hilarious that you know it all has to be real...no one could write anything this ridiculous! Toss in Steve's obsession and the beyond-funny comments of his kids and you've got pure humor.

The other folks who populate this saga each have their own moments of goofy glory to add until it all becomes a fascinating examination of human nature. That the subject of the rivalry is an old video game only adds to the tragi-comic dimensions.

I saw King Of Kong at one of the few theatres to screen it in the country (big props to the Alamo; this deserved much wider release), and walked away feeling surprised and happy after laughing so much and so hard. Who woulda thunk there was this much catharsis in a movie about two middle-aged video game freaks? I'm guessing that within a few years this will be a true cult classic. It sure deserves to be; it's one of the most subtle and beautifully-edited documentaries in many a year.

And man is it funny.",1192924800,10,1525,4.471223021582734

3239542,5,B000XQ4HR8,"This is a great documentary, partly because the Mitchell character is as lame as they come. Wiebe seems like an overall sound human being. He demonstrates sound work ethic, has a lovely family, and just an overall nice guy. Then comes in this Mitchell guy, who's like Shooter from Happy Gilmore. Just a guy who lives for his records, even if they're not real records anymore. The kind of neighborhood kid who knows very well Street Fighter II was the real start of the Capcom fighter game craze, but because he sucks at it, yet is good at Street Fighter I (just because no one plays that anymore), he tries to sabotage the Street Fighter II machine or pretends it's not all that -- when you know it was all that!

Dude knows that Wiebe's video was as legit as they come, so he hires his crony friends to investigate and, after a legit machine at home, still ultimately gets Wiebe's record disqualified. Hey, but that makes for your textbook villain, so I guess this documentary is good in the sense that some lame-o is actually willing to go textbook Disney villain on you. I'm sure Mitchell even cackled at home once his crony friends verified that Wiebe won't be a problem anymore. Go full Dr. Evil, I guess. Super formulaic, but people like that actually exist.

I'm glad Wiebe showed genes have the ultimate say, and a superior score eventually does resurface again for Wiebe -- when you're better, you're better. Take that title back! It was satisfying. Good job, Mr. Mitchell for playing the lame villain.

Then I hear someone beat his Pac-Man score too. Funny as hell to hear that he claimed to be really close to  getting that perfect score too, but oh, a kid pulls the chord and the game ended. Ha ha! I tell you, he's that kid that would do anything to not admit defeat, because that's all you live for. To win. Even if that win is a lie. But it's hilarious to see the joke keeps playing itself out. Mr. Mitchell never deserved his records, when you're a douche and can't pass the torch, when it's already old as all hell. Some kind of resurgence happened as it seems a flood of people came in to throw these two titans far away from even the top 10 in the world.

3239543,5,B000XQ4HR8,"The King of Kong gives you a great look at the lives of these two Donkey Kong masters, achieving high scores on camera in the effort to top each other's highest score. While film editing can distort perceptions of the stars, much of the film seems to give a fair view of what counts the most, these heroes achieving their highest scores at one of the more challenging video games in the arcades.

What is nice about this documentary, is the decent  footage of Donkey Kong in play, yet ultimately, it would be even better if we got to see at least one full level completed without interruption. Yet that brings up the point that in order for these gaming stars to reach their best run through, they have to do repetitious movements and actions to do it. With that in mind, it's completely understandable why the filmmakers chose not to show an entire level's completion. Learning about these two competitors, and all they had to sacrifice to succeed among many set backs, gives this film an entertaining quality for gamers and non gamers alike.",1486080000,,1043,4.632432432432433

Apparently someone beat both Steve and Billy's records by a long shot so hopefully they get on with their lives.  My favorite part of the movie is when Steve's little daughter says that people ruin their lives trying to get into the guiness book of records.

In fact, it took me a year to get around to watching it because the premise just sounded so lame. I won't even try to explain it, I'll just tell you this: If you love the cringe-worthy episodes of the office (us), the delusional arrogance of fictional characters like Dwight Shrute, you'll love this movie. At first I really didn't think Billy Mitchell was a real person, I thought this was a mockumentary. Even more so in the scene when Brian Kuh is calling him to conspire against steve weib from the other side of the arcade. This just seemed like a scene straight out of the office, the strangely loyal Dwight trying hard to protect his ""hero"" who has done little to deserve such loyalty.

in the end, I can't decide if I think it's sad or funny that Steve Weibe and a few other ""normal"" people get caught up in this delusional little world of competitive classic arcade gaming.

Steve has done it and video taped it.  His game is looked at and it is decided that his game may be rigged! His only recourse is to perform the task live, so he has to go to a sanctioned arcade to show his skill, one guy tries to ice him like a time-out called just before a kicker kicks a field goal.

This is a film that not only took me on a tour of great memories from my youth, but also left me feeling inspired.  At turns the story is funny, intense, joyful and heartbreaking.

The 60 year old ""game referee"" hippie, the douche bag with the high score, his loyal minion, the good guy trying to topple the ""empire."" It's all very rich and the best part is that it's factual.

Though there are some inaccurecies, such as Wiebe submitting only one tape (he submitted four) it's never made up, just ommitted. The advertising sells it as a comedy, but though this is comedic, it's not just that. It's about people doing extraordinary things just to prove a small, but important, point. It's about the lengths people will go to confirm themselves on an old 1981 machine. Yes, they're all pretty much lunatics, but they're lunatics you can understand :D

I would really recommend this movie to anyone as a classic ""good"" vs. ""evil"" battle movie. There is ego and innocence, locked together, that really gives this movie a tension that is so hard to manufacture.",1365724800,,800,4.472602739726027

It evoked a wide range of emotions from me. Laughter, fascination, indignation, and a little bit of sadness. The included extras are fairly extensive and give some of the characters (including a couple who maybe could be considered ""villains"" in the film) a chance to talk about some different subjects as well as how they feel about their role in the film. I think more than anything else, I would describe this movie as ""human.""

3239704,4,B000XQ4HR8,"This documentary tells the unlikely story of Steve Wiebe. Laid off from his job and with lots of time on his hands he decides to try and break the all-time high score on Donkey Kong, a 1980s arcade game. The record has been the same for over 20 years, held by video gaming legend Billy Mitchell. Steve films his attempts and when he finally breaks the record, sends the tape off to a small organization of people who have set themselves up as the keeper of the records. They disallow his record game for murky reasons so Steve flies across the country to New Hampshire to a gathering of gamers to play live. There he breaks the record again. Having witnessed it, they proclaim him the new king of Donkey Kong . . . until . . . they view a video tape sent by Billy Mitchell showing him recording an even higher score. Wiebe continues his quest but also tries to get Mitchell to come out and play him live head-to-head. Mitchell refuses to play.

Steve Wiebe comes off as a sympathetic figure. Out of work and feeling bad about himself he turns to the video game record as a way to boost his self esteem while he figures his future out. Billy Mitchell is portrayed as a narcissistic douche who's scared to lose. Twin Galaxies, the organization given the power to accept or deny a filmed score, seems to want to do the right thing but are all too enamored of players like Billy and their sense of entitlement. They seemed reluctant to accept Steve's score mainly because they didn't know him. He was an interloper into their insular world and on top of that was a better player than them.

The movie was funny at places that weren't necessarily intentional. The seriousness with which these video games records are taken by some of the participants leads to laughs. All in all King of Kongs was more fascinating than it should have really been considering the subject matter.",1364083200,,1872,4.502941176470588

3239725,5,B000XQ4HR8,"Much like video games themselves, King Of Kong is highly addictive.  The story does look at the history of video games and the high scores people achieve on them, but the essence of the documentary revolves around unassuming nice guy Steve Wiebe, a virtual unknown in the competitive gaming field and brash, cocky and arrogant Billy Mitchell, named gamer of the century and generally considered the greatest gamer of all time.  Mr. Wiebe has set out to break Mr. Mitchell's long standing Donkey Kong high score record.  Spending hours mastering the game in his garage and filming his attempts, he finally thinks he breaks the record.  When he sends it in for verification to Twin Galaxies, the organization that tracks and verifies the records, he is denied as his machine is inspected and found to contain a circuit board provided by Roy Schildt who is Mr. Mitchell's nemesis. Forced to play in person at the official gaming arcade in New Hampshire, Mr. Wiebe must force the people at Twin Galaxies to not just accept his high score, but fight for his integrity and credibility as player, Mr. Wiebe does indeed break Mr. Mitchell's score.  Despite Mr. Mitchell railing against players who videotape themselves in order to break records, he sends in a tape to Twin Galaxies that shows he re-sets the high score.  The tape is accepted as authentic and the score goes into the Guinness Book of World Records.  The heart of any good documentary is the subjects and Mr. Wiebe and Mr. Mitchell are highly compelling figures.  You find yourself rooting for the steely determination of Mr. Wiebe while finding yourself hating Mr. Mitchell as a braggart who is trying desperately to hold on to past glories as he sees them starting to slip away.",1324252800,,1737,4.824915824915825

3239727,5,B000XQ4HR8,"There really is no denying the allure of classic video games. Games like Pac Man, Donkey Kong, Centipede, Joust, Defender, and Galaga are simple in terms of graphics and goals. These were the classic ""man vs computer"" machines that judged a player's skills based on the points system. After this generation of classic video games, scores are pretty much obsolete for the next generation of video games since the whole object is to complete the game. The points total represented a gamer's skill in classic pattern recognition, quick reaction, critical thinking, pattern analysis and response, as well as hand-eye coordination. These vintage games will never be equaled, and will continue to live on.

This documentary represents both the old and the new very well in terms of the actual gamers that love and play these games competitively. The film kicks off with a little background and then jumps right into the story of Billy Mitchell, the man who holds the title of ""Gamer of the 20th Century"", as well as several record-breaking scores in classic games. Billy Mitchell's story originates in 1982 when he was named the World Champion at Centipede for his high score and then challenged the Donkey Kong champion. Mitchell, in public, set an astounding record at Donkey Kong that would be unrivaled for over 20 years. The documentary spends a few minutes interviewing Mitchell who attributes his entreprenurial success (he owns a successful restaurant chain and a business that sells hot sauce) to his passion to succeed, the same passion he applies to classic video games. In short, the interviews with Mitchell sell the viewers a portrayal of Mitchell as a seemingly arrogant man who appears to believe himself as infallible.

The documentary then shifts gears as we are introduced to Steve Wiebe, a humble and likeable family man that appears to have caught several tough breaks in life. Wiebe one night sees Billy Mitchell's high score posted on the Twin Galaxies website and dedicates himself to conquering the score, which he ultimately does. He then submits the recording of him breaking the score to Twin Galaxies, the organization that recognizes, authenticates, and records high scores in classic games.

From here, the documentary launches into the real meat-and-potatos portion of the film, which is the rivalry of Billy Mitchell vs Steve Wiebe in Donkey Kong. Controversy surrounds both Mitchell and Wiebe's submitted recordings, and Wiebe is drawn to an annual convention at a classic arcade spot on the east coast that encourages competitive gamers to come and attempt records in public. To Wiebe, this is an opportunity to settle the score and end the controversy. Unfortunately, more controversy ensues and Wiebe returns to the arcade some time later only to come up short. The documentary ends on a high note as a post-production note reveals that Wiebe would eventually be recognized as the record holder for the high score of Donkey Kong.

What makes this documentary so compelling is the fueled rivalry between Mitchell and Wiebe. The two really couldn't be further different from each other outside of their desire to be the record-holder. Mitchell is a respected and recognized semi-celebrity that appears to have always have luck on his side and comes across as conceited, whereas Wiebe is a very humble and likeable family man with no video game pedigree whatsoever, and doesn't really appear to have a vicious fiber in his body. Despite the fact that the movie centers wholly on these two persons, they are only in the same room once in the whole film, which is nothing more than a brief encounter where Mitchell appears to rudely snub Wiebe at the arcade. This encounter, while no more than a few seconds in length, is central to summing up the attitudes of the two main characters. Wiebe calls Mitchell several times to inquire whether or not he will appear at the arcade, but never actually gets ahold of him. Wiebe asks other gamers who are friends of Mitchell whether or not Mitchell will show, and other than Mitchell's brief cameo at the arcade, he never does.

The controversy reaches a fever pitch when Mitchell is on the phone with a friend at the arcade who witnesses Wiebe breaking Mitchell's Donkey Kong score in public. Wiebe enjoys a humble celebration for only one day when Mitchell submits a controversial video tape of himself breaking one million points. Twin Galaxies officially recognizes Mitchell's questionable score and Wiebe is instantly unseated as champion. This instance comes across as highly questionable in the film not only due to the screen flickering on Mitchell's recording, but also because interview footage earlier in the film have Mitchell stating that video recordings are meaningless, that the score must be demonstrated in public. Also, Wiebe had submitted a tape to Twin Galaxies earlier in the film of himself breaking one million points, but Twin Galaxies refused to recognize the score because it was on a video tape. For the most part, Twin Galaxies and even Billy Mitchell appear quite the hypocrites at this point in the film.

It's hard to fault Mitchell though. Personally, I understand that the film was pushing an agenda and the rivalry and controversy does make for great entertainment. The only entities that I truly fault are Twin Galaxies and their staff. True, they are promoting a very fascinating rivalry, but they appear quite biased towards promoting Billy Mitchell as the superstar gamer while taking dubious actions towards disputing Wiebe's accomplishments. Mitchell may have acted hypocritical, but Twin Galaxies rewarded the behavior of Mitchell and unfairly punished Wiebe. On top of that, the friends of Mitchell take part in some very absurd behavior, constantly calling Mitchell and informing him of Wiebe's whereabouts and actions. At one point, they even shun Wiebe for appearing at the same restaurant they are eating at. Twin Galaxies really does look foolish for their display of childishness in the film, and official ""game referee"" Walter Day emails Wiebe an apology after Wiebe leaves. To me, this action also comes across as hypocritical as the email reads that ""Twin Galaxies apologizes for any perceived mistreatment."" Clearly, it was easier for Twin Galaxies to apologize impersonally via email as opposed to in person and after he had already returned home to Washington. On top of that, the apology is meaningless since it doesn't change the fact that Twin Galaxies did treat Wiebe, an extraordinary gamer, unfairly and like an outcast.

The film comes across as very entertaining, and the personalities involved are very dynamic and interesting. Since then, a newcomer by the name of Chien has thrown his skills into the mix, but this original rivalry over the top score in Donkey Kong is remarkable and compelling.",1321142400,2,6829,5.075690115761353
3239728,5,B000XQ4HR8,"This is an excellent documentary that will keep you on the edge of your seat for its duration. It follows Steve Weibe, an amateur Donkey Kong enthusiast on his journey to beating Donkey Kong champion Billy Mitchell's top score. It doesn't matter if you follow arcade gaming or not, this documentary is more about how Weibe is consumed by the competitiveness of the gaming scene and how he overcomes the obstacles thrown by his opponents while remaining an honest person.

What makes this documentary great is that was not dramaticized. Most of the information is presented via interviews with Weibe, Mitchell, Mrs Weibe and the head referees of Twin Galaxies, the official world body for arcade video gaming. The tone is very candid and relaxed. You get an insight into Weibe's personal life and how his journey took an emotional toll on him. By the end of it, I was quite inspired by Weibe's determination.

3239729,5,B000XQ4HR8,"The thing is, *I* used to be heavily into video games back in the early 80's. I dumped probably thousands of dollars in quarters down those thirsty video boxes; a few of them I got good at. Donkey Kong was not one of them, (neither Pacman or Space Invaders. Galaga was my game.)

Anyway, you turn some corner at some time and video games are no longer interesting. Everything moved to the TV games boxes anyway, so . . .

Who knew there was a *very serious* cadre of 40ish men out there still taking not just video games seriously, but an entire subculture of high scores and ""officially sanctioned"" record keeping bodies.

Watch this movie and you'll find out tons more about this than you ever thought possible. Its *amazing* the producers actually caught this while it happened: some ""baby face"" upstart decides to challenge a decades old high score on Donkey Kong - one of the most difficult and never-ending video games ever produced. Not only does he set the record, he runs smack into one of the strangest sub-cultures around: *Idol Worship* of the long-reigning Grand Poobah of Kong, Billy Mitchell, (not the airplane pilot.)

Turns out ol' Billy played lights out back in the mid 80's and actually became Lord of this very small but incredibly competitive and serious-minded game players. (When you step back and consider, in the grand light of all things, who could possibly care about any of this; and then you find these guys totally wrapped up, its a recipe for endless head-shaking.)

Cheating? Did someone say *cheating?* Yep, this genre is so hardscrabble and cut throat that some have even dared to jimmy the game itself to get an advantage, (and the baby faced upstart is accused of using a ""tricked up"" video machine from a known cheater.) The lengths some people will go to . . .

Billy Mitchell. Massive head-case here. Holding onto his high record status like King Saul. Will not even VISUALLY ACKNOWLEDGE his competition when he makes a ""special appearance"" at his home town arcade.

Oh, that's right. There are some out of the way nooks and crannies in this country that are actually considered MECAS for 30 year old video game machines, and hold national tournaments on a yearly basis, (and you can just smell the testosterone.)

If you ever read or saw the movie King Rat, you'll understand a bit more of how this works; one guy and ONE GUY ONLY is going to be at the top of this heap, and that's Billy Mitchell. He's played Svengali over this post-adolescent enclave for 30 some years, and NO ONE wants to see him deposed. Not the hard-core gamers, not the oh-so-serious ""sanctioning body,"" and of course, not Billy himself.

An amazing look into a world I myself am staggered even exists. Who knew?",1319673600,,2726,4.674321503131524

I don't want to say too much or cast too many opinions of things in this movie, because I don't want to spoil anything, but I definitely have respect for Steve Weibe...and all of the gamers in this movie for that matter.

Through the documentary I learned that - for some- Donkey Kong never went away. The documentary focuses on the lengths to which people will go to gain a bit of notoriety and it also allows the viewer to meet some interesting characters.

The tension in the film comes when an upstart gamer from Washington state - Steve Wiebe - challenges the long-held record of the legendary Billy Mitchell. The film portrays Wiebe as a likable everyman and Mitchell as an evil schemer. The attempt at the record is all that happens in the film, but it's still quite interesting; the viewer comes away wondering why people become so absorbed in their hobbies and whether such hobbies can ever be healthy.

The King of Kong is an interesting, unique documentary.",1307577600,,849,4.691275167785235
3239732,5,B000XQ4HR8,"Man, I am all worked up after watching this fascinating film.  The King of Kong is about so much more than a video game record - this really is good vs. evil, the all-American underdog vs. the privileged elite, the little guy vs. city hall, etc.  It doesn't matter if you've never played a video game in your life.  If you have a competitive bone in your body or if you value truth and justice above deviousness and chicanery, you will find yourself drawn into this story.  For those of us who grew up playing Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, Galaga, and the like, it's an especially meaningful story - and the taint of unsportsmanlike conduct hits us even harder because of the nexus we can't help but draw with our own childhoods.  Donkey Kong may be ""just a silly video game,"" but this story about one man's attempt to break the world record becomes a metaphor for life and how to live it in the hands of these talented filmmakers.  Lest you think all nerds are the same, prepare to meet some true characters in this gaming drama.  You couldn't invent the likes of Billy Mitchell, the prima donna of gaming, or Walter Day, the folk-singing, self-appointed commissioner of classic arcade competitive gaming.

Steve Wiebe is the quintessential good guy, an all-American kid who grew up to become a devoted husband, father, and teacher.  For whatever reason along the way, he just couldn't get a break each time he put himself in a position to realize his dreams.  After he was laid off from work, he set himself the goal of breaking the world record score for the original arcade version of Donkey Kong.  And break it he does, capturing the entire game on video - with one of his small children hollering at him in the background about a certain hygiene emergency at one point.  All he has to do is send the tape in to the official scorekeepers and reap the glory of his feat - or so you would think.  Unfortunately, Wiebe's moment in the sun comes to an abrupt end when the self-proclaimed lord of classic arcade game records, Walter Day of Twin Galaxies, proves himself to be little more than a puppet for longtime champion Billy Mitchell and comes up with an excuse to disqualify Wiebe's score when he learns that the circuit board for Wiebe's machine was supplied by Roy Shildt, one of Mitchell's bitter gaming enemies.  Oh, but Wiebe is more than welcome to come to Funspot Arcade in New Hampshire and prove himself on an officially sanctioned machine.  Wiebe does just that and proceeds to break the record right there in front of the gaming elite, including Billy Mitchell spies reporting every one of his moves to the mullet-headed king.  Ah, but Mitchell is prepared for that - with a tape of his own showing him breaking Wiebe's new record.  Strangely enough, there's a distortion in the tape right when the score maxes out and resets itself to zero - but Walter Day quickly declares it official and restores the crown to Billy Mitchell.

Wiebe returns home and seemingly gives up his fight - until he hears that the next edition of Guinness World Records is going to include the names of Twin Galaxies record holders.  This mild-mannered everyman calls Billy Mitchell out and makes the journey to Mitchell's very home town, setting the stage for the long-awaited head-to-head challenge between the two.  Will it actually happen?  Will the champion who goes on and on about how the only scores that matter are the ones from live competitions yet depends on questionable videos of his own making to retain the crown finally face his biggest challenger face to face?  Will justice finally be served?  Believe me - you're going to want to find out what happens, even if you've never played a video game in your life.  While this may not really be a battle of good vs evil, it certainly does feel like it.  If there is anyone who actually supports the cowardly Billy Mitchell, I wouldn't want to be in the same room with him during or after watching this fascinating and adrenaline-pumping documentary.  The most amazing - and darn near frightening - thing of all is that the filmmakers have said that Mitchell is an even darker character than they made him out to be in the film.",1298851200,2,4176,4.624661246612466

Its about two grown man battling it out for the world record of the classic Arcade game ""Donkey Kong"". The documentaty follows Steve Wiebe as he tries to break Billy Mitchell's record that had been untouched for 2 decades.

The documentary is very good, as they actually show the record attempts and informs the viewers of the rules of competitive gaming. From what is allowed and against the rules. The documentary also tells a little history of ""Twin Galaxies"" who are the official record keepers of all things video games and have been acknowdled by Gueniness world records as the official record keepers for their video game edition.

This dvd doesnt have much special features, except what you would expect:

*Commentary
*A very history of Donkey Kong
*An update (a lot has happened between the time the documentary was finishing filming and the movie's release)
*Some key terms in competitive gaming
*Some artwork (there is even one on the other side of the jacket)

The filmmakers do a great job of making the viewer actually care about a static, clunky video game arcade machine.

It ultimately comes down to characters, and the way they are portrayed in this film leaves no room for subtle consideration.  Who the viewer is rooting for in the competition is obvious.

3239744,4,B000XQ4HR8,"What price will one pay to be the best?  More interestingly, what price will one pay to make everyone else believe that he is the best?  ""The King of Kong"" follows the adventure of Steve Wiebe, a self-proclaimed loser (and more sadly proclaimed as such by loved ones like his mother, wife, and best friend), who wants to do something to show that he is more than the sum of his failures.  His method of demonstration; becoming the world's best Donkey Kong player (what!!??!).  After finding out the high score, held by a supercilious reprobate named Billy Mitchell, Wiebe sets off to conquer the score.  This is when things start getting really weird.

We are introduced to the very strange underworld of competitive classic arcade gaming, where Billy Mitchell is cult leader to a group of sniveling sycophants masquerading as neutral spectators and referees.  At one point early in the movie, Wiebe destroys the top score on his home arcade machine and a couple of Mitchell underlings go to Wiebe's home and take pictures of the computer running the game in an attempt to discredit the score.  They make the case that Mitchell's enemy somehow planted a false computer into the machine and that the score is invalid (I reiterate: what!!??!).  So Wiebe goes to a ""sanctioned"" arcade on the East Coast (despite living in Washington) and beats Michell's high score in front of a live audience (including Mitchell's most reprehensible follower who phones Mitchell throughout to keep him updated).  While this is going on, Mitchell, who was too chicken to meet Wiebe head on despite his macho posturing, has sent a very suspect tape showing a new high score in Donkey Kong.  Despite the questions surrounding both the quality and the timing of the tape, the cult of Mitchell accepts the tape as valid (but won't let Wiebe watch it) and Mitchell regains the record.  Almost a year later, Wiebe goes to Hollywood, Florida (Mitchell's home town) to attempt the record for the Guinness Book of World Records and again, Mitchell cowers from the challenge (yet continues to posture despite his own wife's admission that she had never seen him even play a game).

On the one hand, I root for Wiebe.  He is an everyman.  He works hard, supports his family, and doesn't appear to cause trouble.  He clearly has a void in his heart that he somehow thinks Donkey Kong can fill (or perhaps simply being the best at something can fill).  On the other hand, I fail to understand why someone like Wiebe would waste his time trying to capture Mitchell's crown when there are so many more noble endeavors one with Wiebe's abilities and advantages could undertake.  He fails to see or chooses to ignore the stunted maturity of the competitive gaming community.  His is blinded by his mission; to put his past behind him.  The movie implies that gaining acceptance from this pathetic group of men was a validating experience for him.  I doubt the veracity of that implication and if that is what he gained from this experience, than his odyssey was all for naught.

I hope Wiebe is at peace with himself.  I hope he has exorcised his demons and accepted that despite not being the world's greatest pitcher, musician, basketball player, etc..., that he has a life worth not only living, but cherishing.  But I think the deeper message of this movie is that we live in a culture where the prevailing zeitgeist is that anything short of the best is not only a failure for that particular endeavor, but also makes the person who failed a failure.  Mitchell knows this better than Wiebe and hides his fear of being a failure behind a thin veneer of arrogance.  He knows he cannot live with being a failure at something he used to dominate so he dodges every challenge by Wiebe.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I think most people will enjoy this movie.  The director does not hide his disdain for Mitchell and some of his cronies.  I think he could have explored their point of view a little more instead of simply labeling them obsequious nerds.  This is, however, a minor complaint in an otherwise very enjoyable story that I would otherwise never known about.",1268524800,,4136,4.742657342657343

My main complaint is that the movie makers falsely injected drama into the story by playing loose with the facts, as a little post-movie research revealed.

The film repeatedly showed a graph of the Donkey Kong scores with Billy Mitchell's 1982 score at the top. In fact, Steve Wiebe beat that score in 2003, and when his taped, million-point score was rejected, he was still the official Donkey Kong record holder. Moreover, when Mitchell submitted his own tape, beating Wiebe's new record set at the FunSpot event, it was initially accepted (as shown in the film) but ultimately rejected (omitted from the film), leaving Wiebe as champ.

3239747,5,B000XQ4HR8,"I've decided that I am a total fan of a well-done documentary or mockumentary. Best case scenario for a documentary -- I take away  life enriching information in exchange for a few hours of my time. Worst case scenario -- I'm given great ice breakers or party conversation. Mockumentaries are pretty much pure sarcastic junk food -- tastes so good, won't do much for fuel or brain cell building but delicious anyway.

Best, best case scenario is the documentary that has enough junk food within that the truth is fun enough.

King of Kong has that and more. I'm not even going to pretend to be a gamer, not at all interested in video games, I'm not patient or competitive enough. I would never have picked this one out because of the subject matter. Donkey Kong. Yawn. But a friend brought this little gem over and I couldn't help getting totally caught up in the drama.

Plot basics...the reigning King of Kong earned the title and his fame in the 80's. Building a life, and hairdo, on this monumental platform, he basked in the glory of his records in multiple games. Then comes the challenger, a man driven to conquer and able to rock the King's Mountain.

Throw in the supporting cast, some serious, serious quirkiness and you've got yourself a very memorable few hours. One note. Be forewarned that one particularly over-the-top character turned his record-breaking game win into a Playgirl spread. It's not complete nudity but it is quite a picture and flashes across the screen a few times.

Every moment of this documentary is pure gold, if only because you have to love and admire the amount of obliviousness (or canny sense of self-parody) that would allow the participants to aid in a documentary that so presents everyone involved as clueless, petty, childless, and/or moronic. From the scrappy underdog (who you *will* cheer for, if only because the established opposition is so much more odious), whose toddler son can be heard in the background pleading ""Stop playing Donkey Kong!"" so that his father will come help him in the bathroom, and whose daughter offhandedly points out that, you know, some people ruin their entire lives trying to get into the Guinness Book of World Records... to the established top dog, Billy Mitchell, whose every line positively drips with hilarious self-important haughtiness, to the self-appointed guardians of classic game scores... who are so deeply in bed with Billy Mitchell that they will do just about anything to preserve his status as top game scorer.

It is an absolute *scream* to see the wild-eyed ""tape reviewer"" who reviews the submission tapes rant on about potential cheaters and how he'll stake his life and honor and whatnot on their reputation... except, of course, when it comes to Billy's tapes which are judged automatically authentic immediately, despite frequent tape skips, distortions, and impurities. Indeed, Billy is so trustworthy, that he's on the committee who decides whether or not the people who send in new scores to beat his old scores can ""truly"" be trusted or not. Of course, he's totally fair... I have to bet that Guinness was SO thrilled when this documentary came out, because they're basically on record as saying that this slip-shod organization's word is good enough for their prestigious publishing, ha.

Fans of classic gaming will love this documentary for the fascinating discussions of how and why classic games were as impossibly hard to master as they often were - as well as the interesting programming discussions about the ""kill screen"" when the game code basically just... runs out. Non-gamers will love this documentary for the hilarious personalities on display - really, there's not a single person in this documentary who doesn't take the travails of Donkey Kong (""this machine is *possessed*!"") far, far more seriously than the average viewer will - and the results are nothing short of hilarious.

3239757,5,B000XQ4HR8,"I'm sorry, but Billy Mitchell comes across as a pompous, arrogant, hateful jerk. Here is the inherent problem with the movie. Yes, every good story needs conflict and such, but I recently spoke with someone who knows Billy Mitchell personally. Billy's friend says that Billy is not really like how he was portrayed. I would guess editing really allowed him to be portrayed in a bad light, well, and of course maybe his own words. This is unfortunate. I found myself equating him with all the high school bullies that I ran into. I'm sure this film really hasn't helped him outside of Kong. He appears to do good work with charity, so I want to give him the benefit of the doubt.

The movie itself:
From what viewers will see in the movie: I enjoyed the movie very much, but I come away wishing that this was a friendly competition. Billy never made it friendly. There is one point in the movie where Billy shows up to an arcade that Steve was playing Kong in and Steve says hello to Billy. Billy went out of his way to ignore him and even said on camera to his wife, that there were people he didn't want to talk to. If Billy was such a true winner and as good as he says he is, why not appear and compete in person? I think him sending in a video of breaking the 1,000,000 point mark is rediculous after all the talking he does. This movie leaves me wondering why things played out the way they did and also the validity of Billy Mitchell being employed by Twin Galaxies and being a record holder. This seems like it could be a conflict of interest to me, the viewer.

On the other hand:
Steve Weibe from the very beginning comes across as a nice, humble competitor who just wanted his chance to compete. Steve is the ""hero"" here. He's just down to earth, not arrogant or pretentious. I found myself cheering on Steve and hoping for his success the whole time. I found myself identifying with Steve throughout the film. I think he was a victim in the respect that his board on his home DK Machine was possibly tampered with by another person who has his own issues with Billy. If Steve wasn't very good (because his board was possibly rigged), he wouldn't be second in the world and he wouldn't have been able to achieve that score and kill screen in public on a sanctioned DK machine.

Bottom line, I enjoyed it and wish it was a longer movie. There appears to be several extras that I am looking forward to seeing. I also found all the geeks (judges and others) hillarious. Although I love Donkey Kong, there appears to be people that have made it an obsession which is totally rediculous in the grand scheme of things.

Another problem with the movie: Even the experts cannot pinpoint whether Steve's board was altered. They should have had it sent out to an expert for testing and if it was fine, then let him have the record.

I left the movie wanting more, maybe some kind of resolution to the ""conflict"" between Billy and Steve. I really wanted there to be a face off in the arcade, but we were cheated of this.",1248393600,,3019,4.374331550802139
3239758,5,B000XQ4HR8,"The King of Kong is a lot of things: it's a documentary that chronicles one man's journey to dethrone the nearly 25-year reign of a Donkey Kong champion; it's a classic good vs. evil story set within the weirdest framework you've likely ever seen; it's a way inside the head of a ""gamer,"" which lets us see why so many get so attached to a collection of dots bouncing around on a screen; but first and foremost, it's a movie about the nature of competition and why we drive ourselves to be more than we are.

Steve Wiebe is a talented man. He starred in sports throughout high school and college, plays the drums like a reincarnated Keith Moon, and has a mathematical mind that most people yearn for. He's a great guy with a great family, and yet Steve Wiebe feels like a failure. He is a man who puts enormous pressure on himself to succeed, and he feels like he hasn't given his family the life that he thinks they deserve. Whenever he is down on himself, he retreats to his garage and his old-school Donkey Kong arcade.

Donkey Kong is simple for Steve. It's formulaic, it's controllable, it's simple numbers and patterns. When Steve plays Donkey Kong, he is the master of his own destiny. And he's good at it. He's very good. One day, Steve wonders to himself what the highest Donkey Kong score ever is, and he finds out that it's 874,000, a score that he has beaten many times. The score was set in 1982 by a man named Billy Mitchell, the officially anointed ""Video Game Player of the Century."" The score is registered by an online video game bureau galled Twin Galaxies, the official scorekeepers for all video game high score records. Steve decides to make a tape of his game and send it in.

Steve sends his record-breaking tape to Twin Galaxies, after which he can officially call himself the best Donkey Kong player ever. But when Billy Mitchell gets word that his record has been broken, he does some investigating and discovers that Steve Wiebe has ties to a man who is Mitchell's arch-nemesis, a man who's been accused of sabotaging Mitchell's records in the past. Twin Galaxies sends a man to check out Steve's arcade, and even though they find nothing in the programming or hardware to show that it's been tampered with, they throw out Steve's score and say that it doesn't count, due to suspicion that Wiebe is using an altered arcade. What follows is Steve's attempt to overthrow the duplicitous Mitchell in a series of live tournaments, so as to prove his supremacy once and for all.

The plot, as you might think, sounds absolutely ridiculous. It's an over-dramatization of a meaningless story. But it really isn't. The movie doesn't try to create drama where there isn't any, nor does it paint anyone as someone they're not. Sure, it's biased towards Steve Wiebe, but it should be. This is a man who's trying to prove to himself that he's good at something, the best in the world, in fact, even if it's at something as trivial as Donkey Kong. How many people can say that they're the best in the world at something? He's up against a selfish, arrogant swindler who doesn't make it difficult for the filmmakers to paint him as the bad guy. The story doesn't necessarily pan out the way that you think it will, and it's not necessarily guaranteed that Steve gets the record.

Growing up in the boom of video games in the 80's/early 90's, I'm probably more suited to enjoying this movie than most. However, I don't think that being a fan of games is a prerequisite for enjoying this movie, because I truly don't think that it's about that. It's about proving to yourself that you can achieve something great, and learning never to give up on yourself because every one of us, whether its big or small, can be great at something.",1248307200,,3745,4.5586924219910845

I was lucky enough to see Chasing Ghosts at the LA film festival a couple years ago, prior to seeing King of Kong. I may have given King of Kong 2 stars had I not seen the awesome doc (Chasing Ghosts) detailing the lives of all the guys that made the cover of Time Life and played at the Twin Galaxies arcade in Ottumwa, Iowa- fighting for bragging rights at the 1982 Video Game World Championships. Billy was one of the guys, as well as some of the more minor players in King of Kong. By the time I saw K.O.K. I knew all about these guys and what their lives were like then and now. It's both hilarious and sad and makes King of Kong make soooo much more sense. Why hasn't CHASING GHOSTS been distributed? It should be sold as disc one of a 2 disc set with King of Kong.

Where is Chasing Ghosts? is what I have to say about King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters. Walter (the ref) and another of the players (not Billy) were at the screening... and sadly didn't understand why it was called ""Chasing Ghosts"" (both a pac man reference & one that speaks of looking back on this strange moment of history and the way these men seem to somehow try to cling to it).

3239762,4,B000XQ4HR8,"On one end, this was an excellent movie which really made a good effort to bring the legendary status back to retro arcade games. Over the decades there is no doubt about the fact that games like Donkey Kong, Pac Man, etc. are more than just video games, they are a vital part of our culture. Simple to learn and impossible (for most) to master. Much of the coverage given to many of the enthusiasts, pros and record holders was long overdue. This movie was also able to capture some of the quirky, dorky, ridiculous behavior exhibited by many of the competitors.

  On the other end... well... the depiction of Billy Mitchell as the ""villain"" and Steve Wiebe as the ""victim"" was completely over dramatized and unfair. These film makers took hours and hours of footage and pieced it together into their own little ""Good Guy VS Bad Guy"" reality. If you really pay attention, you may notice that this ""documentary"" is really much closer to a ""reality show"" because of the way that is focuses most of the attention to the drama between the two players. As with any ""reality show"" or drama, it must have a beginning, conflict, climax, resolution and ending, complete with a ""hero"" and a ""villain"". This is the difference between a documentary (based on facts) and a reality show/drama (based on a story).

  I have never met Billy Mitchell personally, but I will say that I used to eat at Rickey's (Billy's restaurant in the movie) at least once a month. I don't even drink but the food & atmosphere is the best in that area. If you look around on the walls in that place, you may notice all of the pictures of the local little league, softball teams etc. and the thousands of dollars that he contributes to the community every year. Billy may be arrogant and (gasp!) ""not perfect like us"" but is not a ""bad guy"" by any stretch of the imagination. Don't believe everything that you see on T.V.

 In the real world Billy is really just a working class stiff like everyone else and not a celebrity. Now imagine if somebody followed YOU around with a camera for days, took all of the footage of you ""acting out"" and then put it all into a film to make you out as a villain, FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. I know that if somebody filmed me playing Halo or GTA, I would look scarier than Charles Manson on a bad hair day. People would be rolling up their car windows and locking their doors when I walked by. All of the hard work spent making a successful business for your family and donating time and effort to the local community would go UNNOTICED because you got COCKY playing DONKEY KONG! FREAKING DONKEY KONG! Seriously you guys. It's a great game and all but gosh... it's just Donkey Kong.

And finally, the real ending to this movie that was conveniently left out... Billy Mitchell IS STILL the King of Kong. He holds the world record again. The fact is that he is STILL the best Donkey Kong player in the world and Steve can't touch his score. Steve got his 15 minutes of fame for being the second best player in the world (which is 15 more than anybody else gets). End of story.",1241827200,2,3076,4.430088495575221
3239763,3,B000XQ4HR8,"The Bottom Line:

It's got a great title and it won't bore you, but The King of Kong commits the number one sin that documentaries can be guilty of--it exaggerates, distorts, and embellishes the trut--and since a ""true story"" is really the primary reason to watch a documentary, that doesn't leave me with much to recommend the film.",1241568000,3,333,4.741379310344827
3239764,4,B000XQ4HR8,"I always find it amazing that people give their consent to appear in films like this, and I can only think of two reasons why they would.  Either they are completely unaware of how they are going to come across on screen, or else the thrill of being filmed overrides any second thoughts.  I don't automatically assume anything about these people one way or another, but a film like this demands oddballs, so it's certainly in the filmmaker's vested interest to make them appear as entertaining as possible, to show them in the worst, or craziest, light.  For someone to blithely hand their image over to that sort of ringmaster seems way too trusting to me.

Even so, 'King of Kong' is an extremely entertaining film, and as I assume no one put words into the participants mouths, the people in the film make the director's job that much easier - if he wants oddballs, all he has to do is keep the camera rolling and the people talking.  Many people interviewed and followed on film have spent a good chunk of their lives mastering classic arcade games, and while it might be tempting to snicker or look down on them for it, the subtle fact the film never raises is that any form of obsessive behavior lends itself to the silent ridicule of a camera's reflection.  It doesn't matter if one builds model trains in their basement or spends 30,000 dollars on a bass boat, desperately trailing after an obsession to the exclusion of any other worthwhile pursuit is just asking to be roasted on the spit of mockery.  Especially when the subjects are vying for the title of 'Best'.

And superficially, that is what 'King of Kong' is about - two two-bit gladiators in search of the official Donkey Kong high score, and the right to inscribe their three letter call sign into the starry sky of the arcade galaxy.  Steve Wiebe, out of a job and in search of meaning and substance in his life, turns his attention instead to Donkey Kong and the decades old high score of that shining beacon of classic arcade game enthusiasts, the ayatollah of rock and rolla, Billy Mitchell.  How these two resolve the contest, and how at first the established gaming community closes ranks around Mitchell when he's challenged is indeed entertaining in a tempest in a teapot sort of way, and especially as a study in human psychology.

But there's a distateful undertone to these people's pursuits too.  The first time Wiebe breaks the record, it's in his garage, and videotaped.  As he creeps nearer to the record, there is a point where his young son has some bathroom issues and needs parental assistance with toilet tissue.  At one point, you can hear the boy crying for his dad, and then scream, ""Please quit playing DONKEY KOOOOOONG!""  It is an excrutiating film moment.

Steve Wiebe makes a statement halfway through the film to the effect that he was only looking for something that could be his, something that would belong to him after missing out on some other goals in life.  From the movie it's clear that he has pretty nice family (and one helluva supportive wife), and it seems sad that he's driven to such an extreme for a rather empty bid at immortality.  I can't condemn him though, as I've had plenty of obsessions myself both in the past and waiting for me in the future.  Except viewing those obsessions through the prism of competitive classic arcade gaming shines a pretty unfavorable light on obsessive behavior of any kind.",1240099200,3,3423,4.656146179401993

""King of Kong"" is like the Sea Biscuit of video game films.  The young unheralded and unlikely West Coast competitor finds real success, and travels across country to chase and challenge the established East Coast titan, and the record book hangs in the balance.  Like in Sea Biscuit, the established champ dodges this newcomer and plays everything to his own advantage.

Somewhere along the line, I became truly invested in challenger Steve Wiebe's quest, and with each growing minute, wanted victory for him more and more.  And the veteran champ Billy Mitchell seems to always be one step ahead, keeping Wiebe from his record.

This was a very well executed documentary, if for no other reason than the fact that there is no way I could identify with the obsession of a competitive gamer, but I was truly cheering for Weibe to somehow overcome the obstacles in his way and win.

I seriously doubt he is the mean guy this movie portrays him to be. Still, if you love video games or just love DK, you will very much enjoy this movie.

I can not begin to describe how much my friends and I laughed while watching this documentary.

Firstly you do not need to know anything about games, this isn't about the actual games themselves anyone can enjoy this.

The premise is this Billy Mitchell set a Donkey Kong high score record in 1982 which wasn't beaten for 20 or so years, enter the underdog Steve Wiebe who simply picked Donkey Kong on a whim to try to get a high score in his spare time.
He tirelessly practices and video tapes his winning score only to be investigated and denied his record.

This is where the controversy heats up and a series of competitions follow to find the ultimate winner with twist and turns allong the way.

3239772,4,B000XQ4HR8,"Let me first say this. This documentary is really good. I thought it was gonna be more funny than it was (though it IS funny), but it really does capture your attention.

Back in the 80's, TIME magazine had an article about some of the best players of video games in America. Centipede, Joust, Pac-Man...all the greats were there. And Donkey Kong. One of the hardest games ever made. And Billy Walsh was the King of that barrel throwing ape. He destroyed the scoreboards with a score of 800k+. Over 300K from 2nd place. It was ridiculous. The man had been on top of that game since 1986.

And then comes along a Steve Weibe who caught a slight case of the OCD (heh). Steve beats the score, but it's a taped score, so the judges that take in tapes at Twin Galaxies, aren't to sure if this wasn't a hoax or a trick or just downright cheating.

Now this is where I begin to say ""Holy Crap... these nerds are ruthless!"" Supposedly this one guy self nicknamed ""Mr. Awesome"" has the top score for missile command but Twin Galaxies won't give him credit for it. So he is at war basically with Billy Walsh. So he helped out Steve with a card for his Donkey Kong machine, which made the Twin Galaxy officials think it's a rigged board. I was seriously sitting on my couch laughing out how almost fake this is...but it's all true.

So to prove his worth Steve plays live and once again breaks the record all the while having a lackey (yes...a dang lackey who thinks he's a protg) of Billy Walsh standing behind him making comments and you just KNOW he's trying to get under Steve's skin. I even caught myself saying out loud to the TV to 'STFU MAN!' Then there is scandal after scandal. Tapes. No Show's. The Guinness Book of World Records. Good vs Evil.
ALL OVER A TOP SCORE OF A DONKEY KONG GAME!

For a moment I thought I was watching a highschool girl chick flick because in one scene Steve shows up to a restaurant owned by Billy Walsh and some of the gaming dudes there were saying stuff ""omg...I can't believe he's here. He just invited himself here."" Seriously guys? It's a public restaurant. Not your D&D JOLT infused gaming nights in your mom's basement.

3239773,4,B000XQ4HR8,"The King of Kong does the amazing feat of creating a fascinating film about competing for high scores in a retro video game. More than a study of a subculture - a benevolent study at that, when it would be so easy to poke fun at its subjects - it is a classic David vs. Goliath story, an incredibly likable family man who has always come up second challenging the arrogant, self-righteous champion. And that champion, Billy Mitchell, is so easy to loathe, comparing himself to Joan of Ark and constantly referencing his winning nature, that half the fun of this movie is simultaneously laughing at him and despising him.

It's clear who to root for here - and I know that there's some controversy surrounding this, Mitchell fans saying that the documentary doesn't properly tell the truth, making Wiebe (our David) look better and Mitchell look worse, and perhaps that's true.

3239774,5,B000XQ4HR8,"Admit it -- a film about two guys locked in a titanic stuggle to become the world champion of Donkey Kong just invites parody. This battle of the geekoids -- new against old, cocky champion against hopeful challenger -- is worthy of a smarmy Hollywood farce.  But the charcters that director Seth Gordon has captured in ""The King of Kong"" are very real and very commited to their hobby. The craf involved in the story is a matter of smart editing, not of clever writing.

When it came to enjoying this film, it didn't hurt that my family lives within easy driving of Weirs Beach, NH, where some of the action in this film takes place. We visited Funspot just last weekend, and saw the very machines recorded in the film. The place is real, the competitors are real and the competition is real. It's hard to imagine a more fascinating battle, with more different competitors. Champion Bobby Mithell has held the Donkey Kong title since 1982. He has parlayed his notoriety into a successful hot sauce business. With his BeeGee's era beard and blow-dried do, he clearly thinks more than a little about himself. His competitor, Steve Wiebe, is a schlumpy Seattle dad and science teacher -- the kind of guy with lot of talent who has never quite hit the big time in spite of his enormous ambitions to succeed. He finally finds his niche in playing Donkey Kong. Buying his own game, he maps the game's dozens of screens, mastering moves that he hopes will give him the success that has always just barely eluded him. Though their sympathies are clearly with Wiebe, the filmmakers never let on how the contest will come out until the end.

Congratulations to the makers of ""The King of Kong"" for letting this small, strange demimonde of players, wannabes and self-styled referees speak for itself.

3239776,5,B000XQ4HR8,"This movie should be required viewing in any college level sociology class. The film documents a man who would struggle to actually be an outcast in any social group attempting to penetrate a clique of individuals who have likely been outcasts their entire lives.

Steve Wiebe is almost painfully average.  He's a middle-class school teacher who'd been an above average athlete and he plays a couple of musical instruments.  He has a good-looking wife and could be a poster boy for suburban America.  He also has an almost preternatural ability to play Donkey Kong, and therein lies the trouble.

In order to have his record-breaking score recognized, Steve has to break through and enter into a world of people who probably weren't two-sport athletes and certainly couldn't mingle well at an office Christmas party.  In getting his score validated, too, he will be bringing down their king.

Billy Mitchell is the undisputed monarch of these gamers.  I'd first read about him in a 2006 article in the now-defunct Oxford American magazine.  In that article, the author, David Ramsey, tried to convey Mitchell's cockiness but still be respectful.  After this film, I have a new degree of respect for Mr. Ramsey's restraint.

Mitchell is, rightfully, recognized as Gamer of the Century.  He's sort of law and order in this world in that he is uniquely qualified to challenge all high score claims.  Mitchell is also a successful business man and he's married to a woman who you will not admit is hot in front of your wife, but men get it.  Mitchell's success in business and marriage, though, does not tarnish or diminish his status among the gamers.  In fact, they likely cheer him on.  You expect your hero to do well in all endeavors.

When Weibe submits his score, it's obvious that the Twin Galaxies crowd is eager to close ranks and protect their hero.  Weibe is left with no option but to demonstrate his skills in person.  He has to physically play the game surrounded by these outcasts who are so galvanized they have actually become snobs in their own right.  There seems to be several instances where they are trying to distract this interloper during his game-play, with Billy Mitchell himself doing a silent walk-by.  The crux of it is, here's Weibe, a guy who could be anybody's best bud and fit in anywhere, being shunned by folks who've probably been kept at a distance all their lives.

The extra features, particularly the extended interviews, are almost better than the movie itself.  The players describing Burger Time are the greatest thing I've seen on film in a while.  Interesting commentaries, too.

Both men are trying to get and keep the best scores possible for the classic Nintendo arcade game Donkey Kong. Billy Mitchell is the current champion in the movie. Billy has held top scores in many classic arcade games over the years; Donkey Kong being the last title he held onto. Steve Wiebe, currently a Science teacher, decides he has plenty of time to challenge for the highest score possible in Donkey Kong; after he finds him self laid off by Boeing. The movie almost seems to good to be true. Steve Wiebe, being the nicest of nice guys. The prototype of a good father and husband. Against the brash, and often times rude for no real reason, Billy Mitchell. The movie mainly follows Steve Wiebe, in his quest for the title. Billy Mitchell is featured in many segments, but mainly as a protagonist. Billy makes claims of being the best and makes a comment to the effect That To Be The Best, You Have To Play Live. Playing Live in front of a crowd being the only way to truly prove you are the best. This comment is the basis for the entire movie. Steve Wiebe flies all over the US showing off his skills, all in the hopes of being recognized as the best Gamer. While Billy tries his best to avoid him. In a deleted scene on the DVD, you get to see a comparisons of both men's game play. While Billy mainly uses hammers to destroy objects to gain maximum points, Steve uses tricks to adjective his best scores. Like jumping up and down on certain platform stages to get extra bonus points. These differences give some room for an argument on who is truly best, because while both men are adjectiving top scores, both men are doing it in different ways. So who is better? The game player, or the person that finds the loopholes? Both men are by far some of the best gamers on Earth, so respect has to go to given to both of them. As of 2008, Billy Mitchell holds the top scores for Donkey Kong, but Steve has not given up on reclaiming his top scores.
This movie is very enjoyable. I have seen it both on DVD and on G4. It is not a movie I can get bored of. So if you are into video games, even if you don't play the classics's, King of Kong is still right for you. I didn't want to write too much in the way of reviewing the core storyline, because I don't think I review should give away the entire movie.

He had 800,000 points, and that my friends is quite a bit of busted barrels and fallen monkeys.

It turns out that The King of Kong is a wonderful underdog film.  Steve Weibe is portrayed as a likeable everyman who just happens to have a knack for the extreme patience and analytical skill to get such a score. He is described by his family as a savant in some respects but he seems like a relatively normal guy. As a fellow-gamer, I will concede that it takes some work to do what both these guys have done.  On the other side of the coin, we get the sub-culture's heroic golden boy Billy Mitchell.  Billy is portrayed as the villainous and elitist coward and I get the feeling that he didn't get a fair shake from our documentarian Seth Gordon, but I can't be sure.  Billy has a charisma and bravado that will turn most people off, but in his own culture he is the man and his big old mullet is indeed very cool.  He is very successful far beyond his game-playing however, owning his own restaurant and homemade line of hot sauces.  He is the ""Sauce King"" of Florida.  I actually liked Billy but most viewers are going to hate him.  Then again, I almost always root for the villain in these formulaic good vs. evil kind of films.  The people I really didn't like were his toadies and minions who seemed to support Billy and undermine Steve consistently throughout.

There are great characters in this movie.  In addition to Steve and Billy we have Walter Day; the referee and founder of Twin Galaxies, a small arcade that evolved into an organization that tracks video game world records.  Walter is also a songwriter and provides some surreal impromptu folk singing.  Steve Saunders is the old nemesis of Billy who was handedly defeated by the Donkey Kong prodigy 25 years ago.  He is now one of Billy's friends, who in many ways come off more as disciples.  Brian Kuh for example is portrayed as the quintessential Billy Mitchell toady.  He has played Donkey Kong with great enthusiasm as well and put up some very high scores, but he is humbled in person by Weibe's gaming chops.  Brian walks around the arcade containing his jealously with this bizarrely awkward disposition that was one of the film's highlights for me.  He just couldn't wait for Billy to come along and take this guy's score out!  Another character is Roy Shildt or Mr. Awesome.  Mr. Awesome is a fitness guru and a self-proclaimed pickup artist.  Well, where else would one find such a person but in the underworld of classic arcade gaming?  Mr. Awesome is one of Billy's hated rivals and he is accused of unfairly assisting Steve in his quest to shatter Billy's record.

Anyway, the fascinating thing about this film is that it does come off as formulaic in some respects but that is just fine with me because it is coverage of real life.  I'm sure that the editing favored Steve Weibe, but that is because there was a really fun and interesting story to tell within Gordon's footage.  I obviously loved this movie and I would guess that anyone who has any interest in this kind of thing would as well but my wife, who has rarely if ever played any video games, loved it too.

I watched ""King of Kong"" on G4 today, and I came away with pretty strong feelings about ""Twin Galaxies"" and Billy Mitchell.  If you watch the ""documentary"" (I use the term loosely), you'll know who I'm talking about.  Anyway, I was so affected by the film that I ordered a copy of the DVD and the soundtrack from Amazon right after watching it.

Then the ugly truth...

I went to Wikipedia to learn more, as I often do with something I become interested in.  I read the section entitled ""Disputed facts"", and was beginning to feel misled by the movie.  After following a link from the article's footnotes (to the ""Official Statement"" regarding inaccuracies in the movie on the ""Twin Galaxies"" forums), I learned some disturbing information.  The more I read, the more I realized this movie completely misrepresents the whole situation.  It villainizes Billy Mitchell (who admittedly is a somewhat cocky individual) and people who are affiliated with ""Twin Galaxies"".  The worst part is the news media picked up on the story and continues to spread mistruth.  On top of that, most viewers will probably never realize the truth about the situation.

What a total burn.  Shame on the producers of this film.  What a bunch of hypocrites portraying Billy Mitchell as a coward and a fraud.  The real fraud is a so-called documentary entitled ""The King of Kong"".

And, like boys, they pump their fists, and puff up their chests--after having these two, three, four-hour sessions videotaped, witnessed by a referee, and verified by data from the game consoles--when they get the highest score. World Records, by golly, are at stake here!
It is almost charming.
It would be charming, if there weren't a dark side. (Most telling, a young girl, perhaps the most mature person in this documentary, says these records must be important because people ruin their lives to get them.)
Central to this film is the rivalry between two Donkey Kong Kings. There is the established star; there is the outsider. There is the challenge. . .I won't spoil it. . .
Most central to my interest in this film was the personalities of the two gamers. Years ago, there was a memorable baseball article in ""Sports Illustrated"" about Pete Rose, hit king of baseball, and his son, Pete Rose, Jr., a ball player who struggled to get out of the minor leagues. Junior, the article said, would never be 1/100 the ball player his father was. However, the writer added: Rose would never be 1/100 the man his son is.
That summarizes the two main gamers of this film: one is the star; the other is the gentleman.

But, despite having some talent, he never quite made it to the top of the heap. Steve's current interest is in the classic arcade game Donkey Kong and this doc follows his quest to beat the world record. In contrast, Billy Mitchell, the long time record holder, comes across as an arrogant jerk who will stop at nothing to maintain his position as the ""King Of Kong"".

Director Seth Gordon does a fine job spinning this tale of ""good vs evil"".But he never loses sight of the absurdity of the conflict, with touches of comedic irony mixed in with the all too real human emotions on display.

Eccentric characters like Walter Day and the self-proclaimed ""Mr Awesome"" add to the film's charm, though there isn't anyone besides Steve and his family that I would personally want to hang out with. I especially enjoyed the soundtrack, including the hilarious use of Survivor's ""Eye Of The Tiger"" and Leonard Cohen's brillant ""Everybody Knows"".

The DVD also includes some excellent bonus material. This is recommended viewing not only for video game fans but really anyone who can appreciate a good documentary about a rather odd and obsessive subculture.",1210550400,2,1287,4.894495412844036

3239789,5,B000XQ4HR8,"It's the rage in the gaming community right now, and definitely justly so. King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters is the documented story of Steve Wiebe's attempts to attain the Donkey Kong world record. In addition to being very informative about classic arcade games, their champions, and their programming, it carries with it a heart-warming tale of triumph over adversity.

The story begins with a brief history lesson about how video game records began and how they were recorded. We meet Billy Mitchell, a controversial gamer who has held several gaming world records over the last few decades and who was the current Donkey Kong champion. Enter Steve Wiebe (pronounced wee-bee), a soft-spoken family man who has always tried his hardest, but always seemed to be beaten down by forces out of his control. Wiebe has one goal in mind, to be the Donkey Kong world champion, and he knows he can do it.

A veritable host of kooky characters show up, most friends of reigning champ Mitchell, and the contest turns from a friendly competition into an all-out brawl for the title.

This is one the the finest documentaries I've watched in a very long time - on par with the likes of Supersize Me and the very controversial, but well written, SiCK0. It'd be nice to see an update to this at some point, as the tides have changed since it was filmed in 2005.

3239792,5,B000XQ4HR8,"The King of Kong is a documentary about the guys who battled (yes, battled is the right word) to be recognized for the world record score on Donkey Kong.  It's a great movie because it'll keep you riveted to the disaster that is the main character's lives and how they are dominant and famous in only an isolated group.  Fame for Minutia - the American Way.

We are a nation obsessed by Fame.  The entertainment and sports sections are more read than the front page.  The political races are only interesting when celebrities like Clinton and Obama clash.  Britney Spears is a ratings juggernaut despite her debilitating pyschological defects.  Paris Hilton is also a marketing genius despite her inability to pass any math or grammar test in our public schools.  Celebrity, fame, and notoriety drive more money and more effort than anything else in America.  Or so it seems.

Billy The celebrity in the King of Kong is this one guy, Billy Mitchell, who held records in the classic video games, Donkey Kong and Centipede.  In 1999 Billy Mitchell performed a perfect game of Pac-Man, an unheard of act.  He's a self-promoter, a guru of hot sauce for the Chicken Wing industry and a restauranteer in Hollywood, Florida.  In this little circle of people who closely follow classic video game records, Billy is the most widely recognized person and he revels in his fame, flaunting it as if he were the Emperor of San Francisco.  He's an ass.  He graces video arcades with his presence and phone calls as if they should be grateful and loyal just to know him.

The movie is about upstart Steve Wiebe, an unlucky guy from Washington who'd never made his mark in any facet of his life despite working hard and with dedication.  He sought to make his mark in Donkey Kong and Billy Mitchell sought to thwart him.

3239794,4,B000XQ4HR8,"""The King of Kong"" is a classic look at good vs. evil as Steve Wiebe challenges Billy Mitchell for the Donkey Kong title that Mitchell has held for years. Wiebe comes across as a lovable, devoted family man who starts playing Donkey Kong when he loses his job and who just wants to be a winner for once. Mitchell comes across as a bit arrogant, wanting to hold on to his title as champ, refusing to meet with Wiebe in a face to face challenge, even as he emphasizes the importance of ""live"" scores.

""The King of Kong"" is a fascinating look into the world of classic game competition. You can't help but end up cheering for Wiebe and hating Mitchell as the movie goes along. This is partly due to the somewhat controversial editing that shows Wiebe at home, surrounded by family, trying and failing to meet with Mitchell, and willing to show up in public to challenge the title. On the other hand, you only catch brief glimpses inside Mitchell's home, an even briefer glimpse of his wife, and when he does meet up with Wiebe, he basically ignores him.  His unwillingness (at least at that time of the documentary) to defend his record in public is perplexing, especially since he stresses throughout the documentary how important it is to do it ""live"". His sending a videotape of him setting a record in Donkey Kong to Funspot while Wiebe is competing live is one of the more infuriating things he does in the documentary as is Walter Day's decision to use the score on the tape even though he had questions about the tape (to be fair, ""The King of Kong"" neglects to mention that Mitchell's score was soon taken down).

What makes ""The King of Kong"" so interesting is how important the record in Donkey Kong is to both Wiebe and Mitchell. It's clear that Mitchell loves the ""fame"" that comes with the title of Donkey Kong champ. But Wiebe is no less determined to gain the title, sometimes almost neglecting his children (the scene with him first breaking the score is both funny and sad as his children struggle to gain his attention). His young daughter has perhaps the most telling line in the documentary: ""I never knew that the Guinness World Record Book was so... I never knew it was so important... Some people sort of ruin their lives to be in there."" Also interesting are some of the other players who are also competing on various games (I would have loved to see more of the late Doris Self, the oldest video game competitor, who once set a world record in Q-Bert). The scene where Wiebe reaches a kill screen in Donkey Kong shows just how exciting competition can be not just to those playing the game, but those playing other games as well.

""The King of Kong"" is a good, if not perfect documentary. The film plays with facts a little too much - the producers not only omit the bit about Mitchell's high score being quickly taken down, but the fact that Wiebe was not the first to seriously challenge Mitchell's records, there had been an earlier much disputed, record breaking score. The film also neglects to mention that even though Mitchell made it into the 2007 Guiness World Records for the highest score in Donkey Kong, Wiebe also is listed in Guinness for the highest score in Donkey Kong, Jr. There is also some dispute as to whether Wiebe and Mitchell did meet up, especially in a restaurant scene that is edited to look like Mitchell is avoiding Wiebe; and what exactly happened when people came to Wiebe's house to examine his Donkey Kong machine. Oddly enough, these omissions and disputed facts only serve to make the move even more interesting.

""The King of Kong"" is a fascinating documentary.",1205884800,4,3622,4.583333333333333

Anyway, the story chronicles the legendary Billy Mitchell, complete with the '80's bad guy beard and mullet, taking on lovable nice guy, Steve Wiebe, in a battle for the Donkey Kong crown.  The record set in his garage was hilarious, especially when his son cries out to have his diaper changed.

The movie turns into a conspiracy flick, when the disciples of Mitchell do everything they can to discredit the record and send Wiebe home.  But Wiebe has the courage to attempt to set the record in public, and even goes so far as to travel to Mitchell's back yard to get it done.

He seems to have been riding the coattails of something he accomplished, essentially, as a child (or teen). To watch Mitchell move competing hot sauce products on the shelves of a market to make more room for his own is a good encapsulation of the person portrayed in the video. Shifting things around while no one else is looking to make himself look better.  Equivalent to having his lapdog play the video while the good guy is busting his rear trying to win the record LIVE.  Mitchell appears in this vid as a true coward deserving of nothing but everlasting scorn.  Hopefully, he will redeem himself in a sequel.

One is a video gaming legend who has held the #1 spot for 20 years and the other is the contender who's a family man and plays on a machine in his garage.

The way its edited does a great job of painting Billy Mitchell as the villain and challenger Steve Wiebe as the hero.  I couldn't help but get wrapped up in what is a completely absurb competition and root for the underdog Wiebe.  I don't remember the last scripted movie that made me want to see the reigning champ get his title stripped away more.  I thoroughly enjoyed this battle for the highest score.

This documentary is particularly skilled in that it gets the viewer to care deeply about a subject and characters that one normally would have no interest in.

The superb documentary, ""The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters"" takes us to a strange and fascinating world in which otherwise reasonable, responsible adults compete to become the high scoring champions of such video arcade classics as Pac Man, Ms. Pac Man, Asteroids, and, of course, the inimitable Donkey Kong.

Seth Gordon's film focuses on two key players in the field - Billy Mitchell, who has held the high-scoring record for Donkey Kong since 1982, and Steve Wiebe, who, in 2005 (the time of the movie), was threatening to knock Mitchell off his throne.  The movie is mainly about Wiebe's obsession with challenging Mitchell to a competition and Mitchell's dodging Wiebe's efforts at virtually every turn.  Like a true king who has long enjoyed the privileges and trappings and sense of entitlement that come with royalty, Mitchell is clearly not one who will abdicate easily.

At first, it seems as if the movie is going to be just another tale of quirky obsession in a niche area that the majority of us know little or nothing about.  Yet, a funny thing happened to this movie on its way to completion. It found its own unforeseen drama in the nature of the two protagonists.  When they began making their documentary, the filmmakers clearly had no intention of making one of their subjects a ""hero"" and the other a ""villain,"" but, thanks to the actions of each of the men, that is exactly how things eventually turned out.  For Wiebe emerges as a pretty decent guy overall, a bit obsessed with the game perhaps (as, indeed, any person bucking for the title of world champion would have to be), but a comparatively modest, hardworking family man who is treated rather shabbily by the official record keepers of the sport, Twin Galaxies (though they do tend to redeem themselves somewhat at the end).  The many comments from Wiebe's supportive wife, Nicole, and others who know him, go a long way towards humanizing his character.  Mitchell, on the other hand, comes across on camera as a real jerk, a conceited individual more concerned with maintaining his record than engaging in open and honest competition with a potential rival.  It is this unexpected turn into insightful character study that gives the film its special added kick.

Beyond its probing of obsession and competition on an individual level, the movie also lays bare the complex political dynamics that take place behind the scenes and away from the competitions themselves.  We see the manipulation that goes into deciding which scores to validate and which to not, as well as the ""boys' club"" mentality that favors established stars like Mitchell over upstart newcomers to the scene like Wiebe.  In fact, Wiebe spends most of his time in the film simply trying to get some of his record scores accepted by Twin Galaxies.

""The King of Kong"" would make an impressive double feature with ""Air Guitar Nation,"" yet another study of a fringe world filled with obsessive/compulsive players and cutthroat competition.  In a year rife with impressive documentaries, ""The King of Kong"" is clearly one of the best.",1203206400,3,3095,4.911708253358925
3239803,5,B000XQ4HR8,"I stuck this movie into the DVD player thinking I'd watch 15 minutes or so and then go make dinner.  Before I knew it, the end titles were coming up.  This movie starts out slowly and you think it's going to be for hard-core gamers only and then it just sucks you in.

The first time you see Billy Mitchell on screen, standing in front of a copy machine wearing a button up shirt and tie, hair unfashionably long and blunt cut, with facial hair right out of the 70s, your first thought is ""loser.""  Some of this comes from the popular image of people who are hard-core game players as not having real lives.  It comes a surprise, therefore, to find out that not only is Mitchell a world champion video gamer, he is an exceptionally successful business person who is married and has children.  Nevertheless, this doesn't stop him from coming across as a world-class jerk.  While this is no doubt due somewhat to editing, no one put words into Mitchell's mouth and after a while you'll want to roll your eyes at his pompous pontificating.  Still, he's the rock star of video gamers and the world-record holder in Donkey Kong, and even if you think that people who spend that much time going after such a seemingly useless world record need to get a life, you can't argue with the fact that Billy Mitchell certainly seems to have one, even if you'd never want to be part of it.

Steve Wiebe, on the other hand, is one of those guys you'd love to have as your best friend.  Just as no amount of editing could make Billy Mitchell into the jerk he obviously is, no amount of editing in a picture this long could make Steve Wiebe out to be such a good guy if he weren't genuinely good natured.  Even when the video gaming world seems to be conspiring against him to make sure that Billy Mitchell stays on top, Wiebe has a smile on his face.  He's smart, good-looking, talented, and also married and a father.  And such a sap that times, you just want to slap him for putting up with everything with such good grace.

The movie is about Wiebe's attempt to break Mitchell's long-standing world record for the highest ever Donkey Kong score.  Those of us old enough to have played the game back in its heyday will remember how fun it was as well as its sheer impossibility.  But even if you never played, or if that funny looking little guy dodging fireballs and falling barrels while trying hopelessly to rescue the girl never appealed to you, chances are you'll find this movie delightful.  Because this movie is not about a video game, it's about what drives us to keep going in the face of the odds.  The filmmakers do a great job of eliciting from the participants, particularly Wiebe, the reasons for their attraction to the game and the pursuit of the all time high score.  Actual gameplay is kept to a minimum, which is frustrating for those of us who really liked the game, but what keeps it interesting even for people who've never held a joystick.  Even if you think such a pursuit is really stupid, you'll probably find yourself torn when Steve Wiebe has to choose between breaking the world record and wiping his young son's bottom.  You really end up rooting for him.

The supporting players are almost as entertaining as Wiebe and Mitchell, especially Walter Day, the folksinging, meditating, self-appointed guru of the gaming world, who seems to be going out of his way to keep Billy Mitchell on top.  Seriously, you couldn't invent this guy.

Seth Gordon, the director of this film, worked on the movie New York Doll, and he seems to have picked up some of that film's ability to transcend the subject matter and keep us interested in people who might not otherwise seem like anyone we'd want to watch for a couple of hours.  That Gordon can make Donkey Kong into a metaphor for life, and an entertaining one at that, is no mean accomplishment.  I loved this movie.",1203033600,98,3872,4.503576537911302

3239807,2,B000XQ4HR8,"This documentary is based on a true story, but some of the events have been a bit distorted. The film really did a big disservice to Billy Mitchell by pulling a 'Michael Moore' and twisting/mainpulating certain scenes and events in order to make Mitchell out to be the bad guy. (I won't go into details here because there is not adequate space, but you can Google the movie and read all about it if you're curious.)

This was obviously done for dramatic effect, but when you're slamming somebody and calling their character into question by intentionally misleading the audience, that's not cool. Note that I have no affiliations with Billy and have never met him. However, I know several people who have met him (at the classic gaming expo events), and they say although he can be a little arrogant, he's a real nice guy and nothing like what the film shows.

It's still an entertaining story, but just like television, don't believe everything you see.",1202515200,4,954,4.740963855421687

Honestly, if I was Wiebe I'd quit with the video games obsession if it meant having to hang around Mitchell and those other arcade jerks. The only other person I didn't hate in this movie was Mitchell's friend who seemed like a fair and ok guy. His biggest fault is being friends with that creep.

The other reviewers sum it fairly well, so I'll just pile on with another positive review.  I will say it is so much more than just a movie for 80's video game addicts.

For parents - the movie is rated PG-13 for ""brief sexual reference"".  This consists of a 20 second scene about 27 minutes into the movie where ""Mr. Awesome"" says a few derogatory words and shows a couple near-naked pictures of himself.  I watched the movie with my 9 year old son, and the scene passed right by with no problems.  Other than that, I don't recall any swearing or inappropriate content.  However, in the bonus features of the disk, there is a longer version about ""Mr. Awesome"" that is quite a bit more inappropriate, so just be on the lookout for that bonus segment if watching with the kids.  My son loved the film, and now he has an appreciation for the games I grew up with and the skill it takes to master them.

Well, enough chatter.  Got to go play some Donkey Kong...",1202256000,3,1097,4.225961538461538
3239811,5,B000XQ4HR8,"Steve Wiebe just wants to win, at something, anything, and knows he has everything it takes but a little bit of self-confidence and a cause to fight for.  He finds that cause in his quest to master Donkey Kong -- allegedly the most challenging of all the classic video games.  The problem is that reigning champion Billy Mitchell is not about to give up his title as the King of Kong -- one of the last remaining crowns upon which he's staked his reputation and his ego.  The first record set by Steve is challenged on legal grounds -- with the suggestion that he must have tampered with his machine.  His new challenge is to set the record straight, in public and in person -- but Billy is just too slick to put his record on the line without a few tricks up his sleeve.

This is really as good as it gets in documentary territory -- fun, funny, heartbreaking, tense, exciting, enraging.  It's all there -- and what is so quirky and odd is that the stakes can be so high in what appears on the face of it to be the most trivial of contests.  It is rare that a documentarian can find a protagonist as likeable and worthy but down on his luck as Steve Wiebe and an antagonist as devious and clever and diabolical as his weaselly slick archnemesis Jedi from the darkside Billy Mitchell.  For a match of similar proportions you'd almost have to look to Michael Moore's Roger and Me -- except for the sneaking suspicion during that film that it's really Mike who is playing Jedi mind tricks.",1202169600,6,1487,4.381818181818182

This doc is a trip. I couldn't care less about who scores highest-all I know is that Steve couldn't be a sweeter guy-and as in real life, it's the nice guys who finish last...but life isn't about finishing-it's about how you conduct yourself along the way-and that is what makes Steve a winner...check this out, you won't believe what you saw.

3239815,4,B000XQ4HR8,"The simple things in life bring pleasure like, 1 joystick for movement and 1 button for jumping.  Just ask the legions of retro arcade gamers and enthusiasts throughout the world if there is one game that TRULY stands the test of time in its game design and challenge level and Donkey Kong will quickly rise to the top of the list.  Still challenging and still fun after all these years Miyamoto's masterpiece becomes the center of an unlikely documentary.  There is a protagonist and an antagonist, there is turmoil and there are hardships, this is 2 very different mens story as they attempt to master the machine know as KONG.
Director Seth Gordon doesn't get in the way of his subject matter with too many technical tricks he lets the game and the men speak for themselves.  By the end of King of Kong you will look at videogames and the electronic athletes who play them in a whole new light and you might find yourself trying to best one of TWIN GALAXIES high scores yourself.
A fascinating study in what makes the human animal such a competitive and obsessive beast we also see the softer side of humanity in the oddly touching real life character of WALTER DAY, enthusiast and official referee for videogame high scores he is like an enlightened champion for all the pale and sallow geeks who have risked their health for HIGH SCORES.  This DVD is packed with highly entertaining extras that go on and on, my favorite is the I AM 8 Bit section with art and music inspired by and from the 8 bit era. The extended interviews are fascinating overall, listening to 2 gamers break down the facts and frustration in Burgertime is one the most hilarious discussions about gaming I have ever seen.  I am not surprised in the slightest that this is becoming a MAJOR MOTION PICTURE next as hollywood has a BRAIN SUCKER hand over its head, and it is ""starving"".  Next to NO END IN SIGHT this is without a doubt the best DOCUMENTARY I saw in 2007.  Way to go guys bringing gaming into spotlight and doing it with an excellent piece of work like KOK:Fistfull of Quarters.",1201910400,4,2066,4.549865229110512
3239816,4,B000XQ4HR8,"""The King of Kong"" follows the 2004-2006 rivalry and resulting controversy for the title of Donkey Kong Champion between longtime record holder and Gamer of the Century Billy Mitchell and challenger Steve Wiebe. Wiebe is cast in the role of heroic underdog, a junior high school science teacher from Washington state who has chosen Donkey Kong as the vehicle of his success after a series of disappointments in other fields. When Wiebe's videotaped record-breaking game is rejected by Twin Galaxies, the regulatory organization for classic arcade records, Steve is forced to try to break the record live, with referee Walter Day as a witness. Meanwhile, defending champion Billy Mitchell, a hot sauce mogul from Florida, avoids the challenge of his rival for fear of losing his title.

I didn't realize that the interest in retro arcade games is still so intense, as I haven't seen hide nor hair of one of these machines since the 1980s. Director Seth Gordon has fashioned a story from a competition that takes place in front of video game screens by focusing on the characters and the controversy. He digs into Steve Wiebe's past to find motivation, accurate or not, for his obsessive pursuit of the Donkey Kong title. Billy Mitchell is portrayed as a egomaniac who tries to manipulate Twin Galaxies' acceptance of challengers' scores. His fear of defeat after 20 years on top is understandable, even if his actions are not admirable. I have no interest in video games, but ""The King of Kong"" is a character drama that is at once compelling and curious.

The DVD (New Line 2008): Bonus features include 10 bonus scenes, 11 extended interviews, a DVD-ROM (Windows only), a theatrical trailer (2 min), a Glossary of 12 arcade terms, 2 feature commentaries, and: ""The Saga Continues"" updates us on the rivalry for the Donkey Kong title since 2006. ""A Really, Really Brief History of Donkey Kong"" (1 min) is a fast-talking animated history of the game. ""I am 8-bit"" is a gallery of 18 frames of a group art project, with music, inspired by classic arcade games. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish.

The first feature commentary is by the filmmakers. Director Seth Gordon, producer Ed Cunningham, and associate producer Clay Tweel tell us how they discovered the story, how different parts of the film were conceived, and provide additional history of the people and relationships in the film. The second feature commentary is by Chris Carlyle, entertainment editorial director for IGN, and Jon M. Gibson, founder of ""i am 8-bit"". This is a conversational, often joking commentary about the people in the film. I'd skip it.",1201910400,25,2644,4.963882618510158

You will have a smile on your face as the movie ends, unless you hate good things happening to good people.  This is a true underdog story, one that i believe is the greatest story of a newcomer trying to show everyone their true skill.

If you are shopping for a gamer and you just don't know what to get them, get this!  I'd suggest the DVD version over the Unbox for the simple reason that the DVD doesn't cost much more and has some great special features that make it worth the extra money.",1201824000,,680,4.1603053435114505
3239818,5,B000XQ4HR8,"The King of Kong, a Fistful of Quarters is a fascinating movie and great documentary featuring the story of a few gamers that are absolutely driven to get recognition of their gaming accomplishments.  Not modern day gamers sitting and playing on Xbox 360's, Nintendo Wii's, or even Playstation 3's.  Nope, old fashioned, retro style arcade gaming.

Gaming on stand-up arcade systems, or table gaming systems.  Gamers that played (and still play) on the late 1970's and 1980's type gaming systems.  Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-man, Donkey Kong, Battlezone, Robotron and other systems.

King of Kong relates the story of one player that quested for recognition of his score on Donkey Kong by the official recorders of world records for such events.  At the same time the movie offers up a tale of a system that seems to favor the originally recognized record holder for the game.

Can the challenger knock off the champ?  If he does, will the accomplishment be acknowledged?

Get the movie, watch it and find out.

I LOVED this film. Not only did I love the fact that there are people out there like this, it also made me reflect fondly about how great some of these games are. It's easy to discredit games like Pac-Man, Frogger and Donkey Kong in an era of Resident Evil, Soul Caliber and Halo. It their core the classic 80's games are simplistic in nature. But they are F-U-N.

And like those games this film is fun. It's put together perfectly and with a love for the 80's games. The music for the soundtrack is well chosen. The characters are interesting and depressing all at the same time. It's a short, wonderful film about discovering yourself and realizing it's never to late to get good at something. I was so impressed by this movie, that upon my original viewing (a rental DVD), I purchased it today at Best Buy and e-mailed the director to tell him what a great job he did. Anyone with a remote interest in this subject will find this film very enjoyable.

3239822,5,B000XQ4HR8,"Napoleon Dynamite look out. Here are, without a doubt, the biggest nerds on the planet. This documentary is riveting. It is impossible to look away from despite all attempts. The only thing in my life that I can relate this to is when my cousin unplugged the Atari while I was killing at Asteroids. I was 13, and I think I got very mad for about 8 minutes. Maybe 9.

The most troubling thing about this video is not what these people are attempting to do but rather their scruples, lack of them, or the nerdy lackeys that run around doing bigger nerds bidding. The way they look (bad hair, bad beards, bad dress) and the way the 80s have never seemed to end for them is good for a hoot. Billy Mitchell is depicted as some sort of evil nerd on high. In his former life he was probably some sort of carnival barker, wizard behind the curtain, puppet master pulling everyones strings for a laugh.

Steve is essentially Lightening McQueen and Billy Mitchell is Chick Hicks. Go watch Pixars Cars and you will see what I mean. Integrity, being likable, and being a stand up guy with a stand up personality is, in the end, more important than any score on some video screen. I hope Steve realizes that.

Why they use VHS instead of hard drives, live streaming video, DVDs or just play live is anyones best guess. It's a small bizarre community.

Steve's wife (and family) is perhaps the best woman, no, make that the best lady on the planet. I thought my wife was understanding. WOW! Give Steve's wife a cigar. Give her a mansion!

So if you are here reading this then you need no convincing to watch this. It's a good documentary, even thought it's also a bit sad.  Crumb, Crazy Love, and documentaries like them are similar in scope to this. Bizarre, small circles of people, in a zone, planet, world all their own. Aren't we all.

***************What ever nerd decided to go with this lame DVD box image instead of the amazing poster for this film is the biggest nerd of all. I am sure it was some marketing jack*ss who made that call based and some statistical nonsense. What a letdown.

It's about a guy (Billy Mitchell) who got the world record high score on the video game Donkey Kong way back in the early 80s. This guy then lives the rest of his life riding the glory of this nerdiest of nerd accomplishments. Think of it like the big-game winning high school jock who lords it over his town for the rest of his life, but the guy is really a super-jackass. It's like that, except it's 1,000,000 times nerdier.

When the crown jewel of his so-called fame is challenged (and rightfully BEATEN) by an incredibly decent guy (Steve Wiebe) - this mullet-headed jerk (i.e. Billy Mitchell) and his gallery of nerd-henchmen basically disqualify Steve's score and repeatedly serve to undercut every valid attempt for Steve to prove he's better. The rest of the film is an embarrassing display of poor sportsmanship and cowardice (by Mitchell the mullet), and an incredible amount of character and integrity (by Steve Wiebe).
