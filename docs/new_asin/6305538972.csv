1044298,3,6305538972,"I must confess that it was the first cannibalistic movie that actually made ""the stuff"" being cooked in the kettle rather delicious and  appealing. If anything it resembled good old fashioned beef and vegetable  stew like the kind grandma used to make. If any viewer out there remembers  the movie ""Alive"" from several years ago, the ""food""  looked like dried out sliced lunch meat or dried beef jerky. Ravenous made  you wonder where dessert was; the ending was not all that satisfying. The  plot was a bit thin; Not enough spice if you will. Some of the twists and  turns were typical of almost any other horror, black comedy/ drama I have  seen. The ingredients were all there as far as the acting performances.  David Arquette's whacked out role fit him perfectly. The contents of the  movie is graphic and gross; It is not a movie that I would exactly call  ""cutting edge"" or ""innovative-work of art"". Ravenous is  more of a tongue in cheek black comedy/ horror perfect for the Halloween  season. I saw it once and I don't think I'll be seeing it again now that my  appetite for morbid curiosity has been fulfilled regarding Ravenous...",940982400,,1141,4.696969696969697

1044302,4,6305538972,"This extremely gory tale is just one of those movies that affects you after you see it. It just stays in your mind.

1044303,5,6305538972,"Ravenous is a stunningly effective and original movie that received an undeserved backlash from the movie industry, movie-goers and movie reviewers alike when it hit the screens on March 19, 1999. Why? Because, I  think, this film is truly meant for only a small number of fans that have  an appreciation for the bizarre, the macabre, and off-beat actors who  turned what was intended to be a Hollywood/horror flick into something far  more sinister, far more engrossing, and totally subsversive. For those of  us with an appreciation for this type of accomplishment--like  me!---Ravenous is by far the best picture I have seen since 1997's LA  ConfidentIal. It's a story based in the 1840's during the Mexican American  War about an American Army Captain who gets sent into the Sierra Nevadas to  a place called Fort Spencer. From there, the story twists and turns into a  grisly tale of cannibalism and horrific adventure. LA Confidential's Guy  Pearce is quietly handsome and vulnerable as Captain John Boyd, and his  powerful reticence is electrifying, especially in contrast to Robert  Carlyle's rogueish bad-guy cannibal. The scenery is stupendous, the acting  top-notch, the story along the lines of Interview with a Vampire-meets the  Old West Alfred Packer/Donner Party. Totally unique, totally cool! But it  had alot of blood in it, so for those squeamish people out there--be  warned. But horro/gothic fans will love this!",932947200,28,1433,5.187772925764192

I don't remember seeing anything on the description saying it was another region so I was understandably upset.  Now, I'm afraid to order DVDs on Amazon.

1044403,5,6305538972,Timeless action thriller,1490659200,,24,7.333333333333333
1044404,4,6305538972,"For me, theres no way to categorize this film. Was it technically a horror film? A dark comedy? Suspense? Id say a combination of all three. I never thought I would catch this many laughs during so much bloodshed aside from Shaun of the Dead. No, the film is not filled with laugh-out-loud moments like Shaun, as the humor in Ravenous is far darker and loaded with irony.
Firstly, a sincere kudos goes to first-rate writing (by Ted Griffin) and directing (by Antonia Bird) for Ravenous. It all came together with an excellent cast that performed this actively-entertaining, well-paced and even (at times) genuinely funny, expertly-woven film.
The plot catches you immediately as the film opens with Captain Boyd (played by Pearce) being honored with an embarrassing bravery award (and youll discover why later) and a banquet that leaves him sick to his stomach. The film revolves around the theme of humans ingesting blood, meat and variations thereof. Boyds commanding general Slauson (played by John Spencer) is revolted by Boyds open show of weakness and transfers him to far away to California, where Boyd falls-in with the misfits of the remote outpost: privates Cleaves (Arquette) and Toffler (Davies), the gung ho Reich (McDonough) and Colonel Hart (Jeffrey Jones).
When half-frozen drifter Colqhoun (Robert Carlyle) happens upon the remote fort, matters are turned upside down. Colqhoun brings with him tales of butchery and cannibalism by a treacherous army officer when his wagon train became stranded. From here, its difficult to tell you much more without revealing too much. Although the rest of the film centers around something as sickening as cannibalism, its done with enough twists, surprises and justifications that  surprisingly enough  the film works and really well I might add. There is enough suspense, action and humor with revelations for why the cannibals are what they are that it is one of the more pleasant surprises Ive experienced on random rentals.
Be sure of this, the casting for this film was A+ spot-on, as Carlyle especially is at the top of his game.",1490313600,,2089,5.087463556851312

Robert Carlyle's acting is brilliant as well as Guy Pearce and the rest of the cast of unique & memorable characters. The music  helps create unexpected humor in over the top grisly situations.

1044446,5,6305538972,"One of my favorite movies as a child. It is pretty gore but I wouldn't call it a scary movie. It is psychological and shows the brutality of the life during the west-ward expansion and some intense moral dilemmas. Robert Carlyle does what in my opinion is his best performance ever as a smart, strong, witty and deceitful cannibal. By theme and intensity I will put it next to The Revenant (2015) and The Homesman (2014).",1472169600,,421,4.552631578947368

It seems that the film is really a parable of the consequences of greed played out within the context of cannibalism.

1044499,5,6305538972,"Absolutely Amazing.  Read some of the top reviews to get some ideas about how intelligent, stylish, and beautiful this film is.  How could a film manage to combine feelings like the movies ""Deliverence""and ""The Revenant"",  with vampires, and at the same time commenting on the bedrock of American ideals and values.  Some of it is obvious - watch for the moments when you see the stars and stripes. There are many layers to the film to explore.  But, even ignoring any statements or deeper meanings, it's just a cool movie.  It did not feel ""Hollywood"".  It felt artistic in a good way - not like a student film. The moods and music were intriguing.  I found the pacing to be absolutely perfect.  You never felt rushed or bored. It's great to see a movie now and then that isn't the normal idiotic junk.",1457136000,,803,4.559440559440559

I didn't actually make the connection between what happened to Guy Pearce's character at the beginning and events towards the end until quite late, but I suspect that was by design.  Yeah, it was a bit gorey, but after watching The Walking Dead for so many seasons, it wasn't anything that I couldn't handle. Before TWD, though, it would have been too much.

the movie was made in 1999, what is one reviewer talking about in saying it can't remain hidden forever. how long does he feel it takes a movie to surface, or become a cult classic. hellooo guy, it was released in 2014 on dvd - what does that tell you?  some old trash films that went nowhere, so why not re-package them and try and get a few bucks out of unsuspecting suckers.
This is dis-jointed, full of gaps and misplaced happenstance. the ""bad guy"" is crazy at the beginning, later he becomes a well-spoken philosophical  literati.  he also returns as a colonel in the us army....all of a sudden, like he is just appointed as a valued officer - absurd! the writer really didn't know how to put things together so he simply threw paint at a wall and where it stuck he crafted a crazy story.
after the first forty-five minutes or so there is no suspense, just a boring, trite, ridiculous pieced together set of happenings. one reviewer calls this a ""metaphor""....yes, for garbage not for the ridiculous human qualities he tries to liken it with.
another states the acting is ""excellent,"" are you kidding me, excellent? wow, this guy really needs to watch movies other than low-brow gore. that statement alone made me chuckle in its absurdity. guy pearce (the good guy) was very good & convincing, i like his acting, but nothing world class wonderful.
the end (finally), is equally stupid - both good guy and bad guy die together - great, wish it would have happened an hour sooner.
the concept: eat another human's flesh and you take on their spirit, making you stronger, etc.  yes, that is a not uncommon belief amongst third world peoples, especially in new guinea and southeast asia (indonesia archipelago), but it does not add the powers anything like in this movie. in this film one becomes almost super-human, it revives the near-dead almost instantly, and inbues them with abilities never imputed to the concept sociologically. in a scene the ""bad guy"" is shot in the shoulder, he falls down seemingly dead, but then gets up perfectly fine and attacks the shooter. later the army asks him to remove his shirt to see if there is a scar from the bullet wound - ther is none of course. also, when he is slashed with a knife there is no pain or incapacity.
in conclusion, if you are bored & wanting to see something on the telly, check out color test patterns on screen or watch the broadcast warning system checks, you will be more entertained and not waste 90 minutes of your life!",1426032000,4,2883,4.588349514563107

Unlike most horror type movies that tend to contrast the one evil being that creates a mass of victims before meeting its end at the hands of a few brave people, the Ravenous story points to the morality of doing what is right for oneself versus doing what is right for others.  The story incorporates themes of the human flesh eating and blood drinking, the Lord's Supper, resurrection from death, immortality, and self preservation to demonstrate psychological strengths and weakness.  I watched it because I like Guy Pearce movies and did not want to see another Zombie or Vampire film.

Of course there is not a lot about this but it is kind of implied. Somehow these characters turn into insatiable, cannibalistic, greedy almost animal like people.

Yes, characters are killed but, aside from about 5-10 minutes, this movie is more about potential threats, erratic behavior, and  questionable quotes about cowardice rather than it being a slasher or horror movie. I really disliked the music (synthesized, electronic-style music for something set after the Spanish-American War) because it seemed strange for the setting.

Bottom line, If you enjoy the genre, you'll love the acting, enjoy parts of the story, and appreciate the fact that it is produced by a company you recognize. Not the best but certainly not bad. Definitely worth your free time.",1407024000,,763,5.145161290322581

A black suspense-comedy that gains in ulterior viewings. Mind you, not at all an up-to-your-face comedy, of course. Wittly dialogues, marvelous actors, excellent production desing and music. Unfortunately, the transfer is not as good as it should; there is very little definition, the image is constantly blurry, like slightly out of focus. It looks as if it was treated with too much DNR and/or transferred from a master tape instead of a negative or print. It has not been restored or remastered either.

However, the Blu Ray release from Scream Factory is only worthy of a 2.5 out of 5 star review.  The picture quality is simply unacceptable.  I was rather surprised that Scream Factory, a company with a great reputation for putting out quality releases, allowed this transfer to be released.  The image quality is quite soft at times, there's a fair shair of mosquito noise, and there really isn't an improvement over the DVD that was released when the film first came out on home video.  Even the opening titles are soft, almost blurry.  The titles are actually sharper on the DVD release. This is one of the worst transfers I have seen on Blu Ray and it's unfortunate because ""Ravenous"" is a great little film that deserves better.  There are some good extras on the disc and the audio is adequate, but with no improvement in picture quality, there was no point in putting this out on Blu Ray yet.

1045577,4,6305538972,"Scream Factory once again reminds me of a movie I somehow missed when it originally came out in 1999. Never the less, fifteen years later I've finally caught up with the underrated cannibal cult classic ""Ravenous"" thanks to a new high-definition transfer. All but ignored upon its initial theatrical run, this effective little horror thriller deserves to be seen by all genre fans.

After being released from active duty in the military, Captain John Boyd (Guy Pearce) is stationed at an out-of-the-way outpost in the Sierra Nevada wilderness. In the cold of winter, he and his fellow officers find a wanderer (Robert Carlyle) who tells a disturbing tale of his struggle to survive the grips of a cannibalistic traveler. He leads a rescue team to save the last remaining survivor of the slaughter. What will they find when they arrive?

Although it's been given a hi-def overhaul for Blu-ray, ""Ravenous"" still holds on to its ""real"" film flavor. The picture is clean and clear, but there's the beautiful grain texture to it you expect from movies made before the mid-2000s. The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround sound puts viewers in the middle of the action and mayhem.

""Ravenous"" is rated R for considerable gore, strong violence, language, and brief nudity. Besides the cannibalism, there's also a disturbing scene containing a broken bone sticking out of a soldier's leg. We get a nice quick glance at Robert Carlyle's skinny hind-end as well.

Scream Factory packs the Blu-ray edition of ""Ravenous"" full of bonus material. Commentary is featured by Director Antonia Bird, Composer Damon Albarn, Screenwriter Ted Griffin, and Actors Jeffrey Jones and Robert Carlyle. Antonia Bird provides commentary for deleted scenes as well. A theatrical trailer and TV spots are included. Two still galleries and costume and production design information round out the special features.

Director Antonia Bird and Writer Ted Griffin fill ""Ravenous"" with all sorts of surprises, gory thrills, and sheer lunacy thanks to a great performance by Robert Carlyle. Here's the perfect example of a movie where, even though it's been out for over a decade, no one wants to spoil its shocking revelations. Paired with a very bizarre musical score, it makes for a cinematic experience no horror enthusiast will want to miss.",1402704000,,2304,5.117021276595745

Occasionally I find that strange movies are much more fun than the standard box office hits, and I am happy to say that this one fits that bill.
Since I am no history buff, I have little to say about its time frame (Mexican-American War).  However, I do know that war is bloody hell, more so when the battlefield is within oneself.
Without giving too much away, Guy Pearce and Robert Carlyle represent the good and evil within all of us, and it looks like someone is having a wicked good time doing it!
Combining a menacing and sometimes silly score, the viewer emotionally shifts between being appalled and wondering if its ok to laugh.  Despite all of this crazy making, theres no mistaking the visuals.
As someone who likes the horror genre, it usually comes down to a blend of character development, storyline, music score and believability (with a hint of imagination).

Quite a bit different from the norm.
As good as any B horror, and better than most.
The soundtrack is filled with some unique, period sounding fiddle that when upbeat, sounds fun. (some of the movies ""darkest"" scenes).
The plot has a couple of unexpected twists that also made the movie fun.
In the version that I watched, nothing  was EXTREMELY grizzly. The brief shots depicting gore were peppered throughout. Sometimes in flashbacks (that are well done, short, and used sparingly) sometimes in the present. All of the goriest shots were stills, and quick.

It is, in part, what resulted in the Mexican -American War of the 1840s, and the undeclared, yet no less bloody war, waged against the Native Americans.

I did resent how many times one of the characters got into trouble when
faced with a life-threatening issue but didn't react at all and just stood
there. Everyone in the film is a trained soldier; they're supposed to know
how to react to a threat. Still, this is a fine film--but not for the squeamish.

1046170,4,6305538972,"An intriguing cannibal jamboree if there ever was one, Ravenous delivers a scrumptious tasteful little film I was more than happy to feast on. After the first five minutes I was left baffled on what to expect next. Comedic tones were already evident but I was hopeful the whole flick wouldn't be marinated in slapstick sauce. I was in the mood for brutality and thankfully I got what I craved.

 Although it did keep dishing out servings of laughter, Ravenous was also brutal as hell on the most primal of levels. The first half left me unsure whether to claim it as horror or not though. I ended up labeling this order as more of an action/horror than anything else.

Cowardly but cute Captain John Boyd has been through some of the worst atrocities of human nature. He has seen war (Spanish-American Civil) and has no wish to lay his neck on the line any longer. Sent to Fort Spencer to room with 8 other folks (all men except for one), the trouble begins when a desperate man soon arrives at the little tucked away haven.

 Introducing himself in a mildly creepy manner, the man is captured and soon tells his frightening story. Deciding to go to the location the man speaks of and investigate, almost all leave (including the cowardly Boyd) and the fun really insues from here. A nifty twist takes hold, some creepy moments, and the tension jumps forth 100 notches full speed ahead.

One interesting thing the script did was instead of cannibalism being simply gory and gut-munching...here the mythology is played up a bit. I don't want to let loose anything that would damper your tastes for this flick, so I'll keep my enthusiam in check for this part.

 Guy Pearce as the cowardly Boyd is excellent. The man's fear is actually amusing yet he is a serious guy. Not bad on the eyes, he plays his roles well and I really got into what he went through. Robert Carlysle steals the scenes. He's menacing, sophisticated, and creepy as a cannibal can get. The man has more faces than a compulsive liar, and he wears them all convincingly.

Colonel Hart (Jeffrey Jones) is another favorite of mine as the man in charge. He's jolly with a great sense of humor and every scene with him was appetising. Private Reich, played by Neal McDonough, was also interesting but in a different way. The man was agressive yet I loved him. Wish he had more scenes though. David Arquette, who I generally don't care for, actually carried his own weight.

 Ravenous was full of dark forboding and great tense scenes. I actually felt some of the trapped feelings Boyd must have. Desperation really creeps in, and director Antonia Bird did an exceptional job. The music (David Albarn Michael Nyman) was a lot different than would be expected but it really worked. That creepy....twang really grates the nerves when it's supposed to.

The gore isn't overly graphic but there's a nice serving of blood. On the walls, on bites, on the ground, it's plentiful and realistic looking. For other forms of gore it's not too detailed but it's stomach churning. Particularly the leg scene when Boyd and his less fortunate friend are in the hole.

 The photography is breath taking, the scenery bleak, the pace swift and upbeat, the comedy extra black, and the theme both intriguing and intelligent.

 But one thing's for sure...I definitely didn't crave a big mac after tasting a bit of this menu!",1379635200,,3365,4.687606112054329

It's campy in a lot of ways, but it's also very emotionally engaging as well. It's revealed in some of the first scenes, but the way the main soldier was traumatized was shocking and well done. It shows the horror of war, the horrible positions people can be put into and the vicious fight between bravery and cowardice. The first part of the film is great for the interaction of the rag tag group of soldiers far out in the mountains. The second part is an awesome game of cat and mouse between someone who is basically the devil and a gutless hero who feels he has no choice but to fight. His fear and quiet timidity aren't portrayed as being endearing at all, you just want to push him and say BE THE HERO!! but he goes about it in his own way.

Ives both,instead of shooting Ives,throw their rifles at Ives. So then Ives kills and eats Toffler and the sniveling coward Boyd dives off a cliff rather than fight like a man. Also in the final fight scene Boyd is clobbering Ives with a huge tree limb mortally injuring him. Does he continue? No. He throws it down and starts to strangle Ives whereby Ives stabs Boyd in the back with a long knife. Good thinking Boyd. Then Boyd finally punchers Ives in the head with a huge steel animal trap knowingly springing it off and killing himself in the process.
I've never wanted a hero to die as much as I wanted this cry baby coward Boyd. He was so embarrassing to watch as he ran away again and again from fights in this film. Also, when the new capt comes and Boyd tells his story about everyone getting killed at the cave the Capt said he sent men to check it out and found nothing. Did Boyd forget to tell them to look down the hole to see all the body remains strung up??? The only character I liked was Pvt Reich who had any balls.

Don't expect a serious exploration of the cannibal mythology or an in-depth analysis of the dark psyches of the protagonists. This is a fun romp, and a bloody one at that, but if you like your films a bit twisted then you should enjoy this. Personally, I like watching anything with Robert Carlyle and while the plot itself was rather predictable, the execution and characters made the trip worthwhile. On a technical note, the picture quality was fine, but it is in the format that basically looks like a rectangular box in the middle of your screen with black bars around all four sides of the picture. I switched it to wide view which eliminated the side bars, but also made everything look a bit stretched.

1046281,5,6305538972,"I'm not a big fan of horror movies, but ""Ravenous"" isn't so much ""horror"" as it is suspense and psychological drama, despite its rather morbid premise. Though cannibalism plays an enormous role in the plot of the movie, I was pleased to see that there is very little gore in the movie. It's mostly the concepts and discussion of cannibalism that exist, as opposed to showing mindless gore in an attempt to stun the audience. And in that regard, it succeeds, as the story is quite engaging, particularly with the emphasis placed on Native American folklore and the legend of ""The Wendigo"".

I saw ""Ravenous"" when it was first released in the 90s, and it's held up remarkably well. It's still an incredible, gritty, emotional experience that transports you to a different time and place. You can almost smell the cold, crisp air of the American frontier, and you can almost feel the cold press of the winter air against your face. The smell of wood smoke drifting into your nose, the heavy feel of an axe as you split logs in an effort to survive the harsh winter... seldom do movies do such a fine job putting you in the middle of their world.

The cinematography is stunning, establishing a beautiful, dangerous, and eerie setting, with excellent locations such as the forest, the military camp, and a rather infamous cave. The story is fascinating to watch unfold- I still find it gripping, even though I've seen it several times (this is testament to the downright astounding job the actors did, particularly Guy Pearce and Robert Carlyle). The show stealer, however, is the unique soundtrack. There is nothing else like it- it seems to fit the period perfectly, yet it conveys a sense of tension, building suspense, and (eventually) utter desperation like no soundtrack I've ever heard before.

""Ravenous"" is a five star film- and this is coming from somebody who doesn't care for horror movies.",1353542400,,1898,4.815950920245399

And then a few minutes later Cpt Boyd (who has a gun) is face to face with the cannibal (who is unarmed) but instead of shooting him, he decides to jump off of a 200 foot cliff??  But all in all this movie is fun and actually better than I expected.

1046284,5,6305538972,"Generally, I dislike horror films because they are often gory without needing to be and/or stupid. When I read that Ravenous was a horror film, I stayed away. Especially with the Wendigo twist because so often Wendigo are presented as werewolf type creatures and I can't stand werewolf movies.

And then one night, when I couldn't stand watching the same films over and over, I caved and rented this one. Prepared to close my eyes if necessary (I really hate werewolf movies).

What I got, however, is much more vampiric (in a very loose way) and not a horror film but a dark comedy that made me laugh out loud many times. So much of the success of this film should go to the composer, who created a soundtrack that lifts the viewer out of the mucky gore of canabilism and adds an almost light-hearted nature to what would have potentionally been gross.

They use the proper Native American take on the Wendigo. You comsume the flesh of another, absorb their energy, make yourself hard to kill and it's addictive.

Robert Carlyle and Guy Pearce are excellent in their own right, but they work well together also. I'll admit I got slightly confused at the beginning as Pearce is sent to a post way out in the middle of BFE to shape it up. Carlyle appears at the fort starving and dehydrated where he tells the soldiers of a horrific occurence; their party got lost, ran out of food and began eating one another. The Major traveling with them went insane and started actually killing people instead of letting them live or die from the cold and general bad weather. Carlyle says he escaped and has been wandering.

Okay ...I'd seen stils of this film and knew that Carlyle was stationed at the fort so I had to rewind and behold ...same story; I hadn't missed anything. So I kept watching and when a new commanding officer is appointed to the fort (the old one gets killed) I had my ureka moment.

It is so, so, so good that I decided to actually watch every scene (I usually close my eyes in horror movies so I don't have to watch anything disgusting), so that I wouldn't miss any of it.

This deliciously wicked film is unique. Sure, there are cannibal films and there are vampire films, but how does one categorize Ravenous? Roger Ebert says it's a combination of both genres and I don't disagree, except Ravenous has a touch of ""biting"" humor. Beautifully filmed and edited, Ravenous takes place on the west side of the Sierra-Nevada mountains just after the First American Intervention of 1846-1848. Capt. John Boyd (played dryly and drolly by Guy Pearce) is reassigned to an outpost in the wilderness of California.
Shortly after his arrival, a stranger, F.W. Colqhoun (played to the hilt by Robert Carlyle) stumbles into the outpost after having spent three months without food. Ha! ""but not without anything to eat"". What happens afterwards must be seen to believed. The supporting cast is strong, led by Jeffrey Jones (Deadwood, Amadeus) and Neal McDonough (Band of Brothers). This is a movie full of blood and gore and definitely NOT for everyone. But if you can stand the violence, you will be rewarded with a very entertaining film that doesn't take itself too seriously. The film is unfortunately 16x9 letterboxed.) Black boarders all around. Hence 4 stars. Too bad, the film would benefit from a anamorphic update.

I love to watch peoples reactions to this movie for the first time. It starts off kind of slow. There are a few flashbacks to some bloody war scenes to set up the back story, but not much action. This seems to lull a lot of first time viewers into a sort of safe or bored state (kind of like when you're watching the History channel). But the story and the action start to take off once the stranger shows up in the camp and begins to tell his tale. From that point on you will be GLUED to the TV.",1334016000,,553,3.9464285714285716

The two or three variations on the cover and poster don't convey how great this film is, instead it comes off as some cheap horror movie.

How about that great cinematic shot of Boyd and Calhoun at a distance looking at each other at the edge of the cliff before the jump? Really, any shot from the film would be better than the open mouth, or bloody knife that are available now. Every time I try to recommend this film to someone and pick it up I get this look from them that speaks, yeah...right, no thanks.
The trailer could have been a lot better without the cheap ""deep voice"" overdub and the fast cut action sequences trying to convey the film as some slasher-horror-action film.

Guy Pearce, Robert Carlyle, and Jeffrey Jones are all in top form here, bringing these characters to life. The score is excellent, a creepy mix brewed up by Michael Nyman and Damon Albarn. I've heard people say there are errors with the weendigo myth and how it is presented, but it's not covered in depth, just take it and run with it. Pearce plays the coward Capt. John Boyd, and he is excellent as usual. Carlyle as the cannibal Ives is creepy, and Jones offers up his usual humor with his character whose name slips me.

1046334,4,6305538972,"Can't go to 5-star since it doesn't seem to me to be ""classic"" material, but I definitely think it rates higher than a 3-star and disagree with those who feel it deserves much lower than '3'.  Like a few other reviewers, I agree that it is hard to classify the film.  Horror, yes, but with interesting ""philosopical"" ideas.  Not sure the comedic elements (as the music during the ""chase"" scene) really fit.  I would watch this movie again and that is one of my personal standards for giving something a 4-star rating.

In response to the idea that this movie deserves lower than a 3-star, I offer Alien Apocalpyse (made for TV) as a 1-star, just plain bad film.  This movie is far, far from that in almost every aspect.  I can see it as a 3-star because of some things (like the generally failed comedic elements).  It could also be lowered by its slightly slow tempo, but I actually think that can be seen to work in this case.

Clearly, though, if you don't like some blood and gore (but not pure slasher) and something a bit quirky, then you will probably not find the time spent watching to be worthwhile.  For me, I guess the quirkiness is what put it over a 3-star in the final analysis.",1309219200,,1193,4.406392694063927

The acting by everyone, especially Guy Pearce as our tortured hero and Robert Carlyle as our delightful cannibal, is superb. The group of ragtag misfits is completely believable and awkwardly endearing. The script is darkly comic, but holds up as a horror movie with suspense and a dash of gore. The soundtrack is innovative and unconventional. It's minimalistic with repeated musical ideas that build on one another. It creates tension in suspenseful moments very effectively. In a climactic chase scene, the music may seem inappropriate, but not if the focus is on the gleeful predator instead of the fearful prey.

When the film came out in 1999, it didn't do very well because of horrible marketing. I remember the first time I watched it with my sister, I was 14 and I felt slightly sick and uncomfortable. After a few more viewings, the movie became one of my favorites because of the mixture of humor and horror and the fact that after multiple viewings, I still find things I didn't notice before.

1046419,5,6305538972,"The western frontier of the United States in 1847 is pretty much the last place you'd expect as the setting of a horror movie and yet the setting as well as the time period add a grittiness and genuineness to the tale.  And don't get me wrong, this definitely is a very dark and twisted fairy tale, though it was clearly inspired by true-life events, like the infamous Donner party murders.  Cannibalism is often used as a flavoring to shock an audience, as with zombie films and the like, but I've never seen the device used more effectively as I have in this movie.  It's not merely a crutch or a cheap hat trick for the director, it's a vital plot element on which many of the story's situations hinge.

Having been shot in the untouched wilderness of the Czech republic, the settings are breathtaking to behold and you are left feeling, much like the characters at the isolated outpost, that you are all alone and there is nowhere to run.  The energy and pacing are exceptional and the performances (particularly from Robert Carlyle and Jeffrey Jones) are compelling.  The script is rife with sharp, wicked black humor that only the true horror fiends will be able to appreciate.  The gore is kept to a minimum, which I think helps to maximize its impact, and the music is both suitable for the period and helps to give the more action-oriented scenes an enervating backbone.

This has been one of my all-time favorite movies ever since the first time I saw it.  It's a horror movie for those who are bored with the Freddys and Mikes and Jasons and roll their eyes at the myriad ""Scary Movie"" send-ups.  It winks at the audience from a face dripping with blood while at the same time holding them captive until the very last frames.  It might be surprising to some to know that a woman directed this film, but if anything, I think that Antonia Bird's attention to detail and efforts to make even the most loathsome of characters seem strangely sympathetic helps to round out the film and keep it from turning into yet another hack-and-slash-er.  The characters are what keep you watching, not the hope of violence or blood.  This is a movie with real meat on its bones and if you let go of any moral or religious reservations you might have, you will find a delightful, energetic adventure in this film.",1209254400,4,2307,4.570388349514563

So the fort brigade sets out to find this cave, starts to investigate and in the process finds out the truth of what happened out there.

The villian is an interesting character but the ending was somewhat disapointing and i was left feeling slightly let down by it even though it may be considered fitting for some considering the circumstances. This one can be considered more of a dark comedy thriller set in the 1840s. It started off somewhat slow then became more interesting as the movie went on.

Unfortunately, the secret he had was the fact that he was a coward, and actually got to the enemy camp as a coward. But something changed for him that day. Well, after his commander found out the truth, he was reassigned to a wilderness fort in the Sierra-nevada's of California, essentially a punishment assignment at a horrible, cold, isolated place.

I will add one thing, though: Most annoying soundtrack possible.  Seriously, it was ""Small World"" annoying.

The only other flaws in my opinion were that the dialog in the last third of the film strayed from the period dialog in the earlier parts.  It kind of morphed from ""Deadwood"" to any modern slasher film (not that the dialog ever approached the complexity of ""Deadwood"").

Also, the opening sequence almost seemed comical - down to the light-hearted sound mixing when the ""Eat me"" quote popped up.  It set the wrong pace for the rest of the film.

Finally, David Arquette - who seems miscast in every film in which he appears - was little more than an 1847 Jeff Spicoli.  It was a shame that his character outlasts the much better actors.

Those were the bad things.  The rest was really a fun watch.  Jeffrey Jones gave a fine performance (clearly basing his later ""Deadwood"" character on this one).  Neal McDonough was great, but got too little face-time. This movie is as brutally violent as ""Wolf Creek"" without having to wait 75 minutes for the good parts.

1046468,4,6305538972,"What is the title of the best-selling cannibal book?
""How To Serve Your Fellow Man.""

Two cannibals were eating a clown. One said to the other: ""Does this taste funny to you?""

Did you hear about the cannibal who passed his uncle in the woods?

All right, maybe those jokes aren't of the highest caliber but I needed some way to start my review...written by Ted Griffin (Matchstick Men) and directed by Antonia Bird (Mad Love), Ravenous (1999) stars Guy Pearce (L.A. Confidential, Memento) and Robert Carlyle (Trainspotting, The Full Monty).  Also appearing is Jeffrey Jones (Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Beetle Juice), John Spencer (""The West Wing""), Neal McDonough (Minority Report), Jeremy Davies (Saving Private Ryan), Stephen Spinella (Great Expectations), Joseph Runningfox (Seems Like Old Times), Sheila Tousey (Lord of Illusions), and David Arquette (Eight Legged Freaks).

The film, set around the time of the Mexican-American War (about 1847) begins as we see U.S. army man John Boyd (Pearce) being promoted to the rank of captain, to which afterwards he's sent off to a remote outpost in mountains of California.  Sort of an odd reward for a military hero, but given the circumstances to which Boyd received his promotion, those in charge didn't want him around (seems an act of cowardice on Boyd's part led to him single-handedly capturing some Mexican military leaders...for the rest of the story you'll have to see the film).  Anyway, the outpost, known as Fort Spencer, is somewhat of a dump, populated by a handful of interesting types, is basically a stopping point for westward travelers headed towards the Sierra Nevadas.  Shortly after Boyd's arrival a half frozen/half starved man named Colqhoun (Carlyle) wanders into the camp and relates a fantastically disgusting tale about how he and his party of settlers, heading west, got caught in the mountains and resorted to eating each other after all other viable (and not so viable) foodstuffs ran out.  Seems Colqhoun himself participated in the cannibalism, but then fled out of fear of becoming the next one to be consumed, which elicits a myth from one of the local Native Americans about a creature known as `Weendigo', a beast that thrives on human flesh, gaining the strength, the essence, of those it eats.  The downside, apparently, is cannibalistic activity results in an ever-growing desire to feast on even more flesh.  Anyway, a small detachment heads out to where Colqhoun and his group ended up in search of anyone who might be left, but once they arrive they learn some interesting, and important, details conveniently omitted in Colqhoun's original story...and this is where the plot synopsis ends specifically because to go any further would reveal some of the twists that should only be revealed during the viewing of the film.  I will say this, though...things get really messy...

An interesting thing occurred to me while watching this film, that being this is the first feature I've watched in awhile that was directed by a woman, namely Antonia Bird.  As it turns out Bird actually replaced the individual originally intended to direct, a person by the name of Milcho Manchevski, who I'm not familiar with...seeing how most of the film was shot in Eastern Europe (Slovakia, I believe), I'm guessing the producers had originally chosen a local director (Manchevski is Macedonian by birth) before settling on Bird for whatever reasons.  Anyway, I've seen this film twice now and I'll admit the first time it didn't appeal as much to me as it did the second time around.  Why?  That's not entirely certain, but I guess maybe it has something to do with the bizarre, non-traditional soundtrack.  I've since come to appreciate the soundtrack, and while it may not entirely fit within the period or tone of the story, it does add some unexpected whimsy amidst the buckets of blood.  Generally I prefer a score to fit with the film and to be unobtrusive as not to draw excessive attention to itself, but I'm willing to acquiesce on occasion.  As far as the performances, I thought Robert Carlyle did pretty well and most of the rest well enough.  I did have a problem with one or two of the characters, though, the main being the one played by Guy Pearce.  Seeing how he was initially depicted as a coward in the beginning of the film (who later finds strength in an unusual place), I had a difficult time developing any sympathies for him or his predicament that develops after he's shipped off to Fort Spencer, which presented a bit of a problem for me given he was the main protagonist within the story.  Maybe this was the intent, I don't know, but it's difficult for me to get behind a character with such fundamental flaw, albeit one that does figure heavily into the actual story.  As far as the production I thought the direction was handled very well, obviously by someone who knew what they were doing, and the overall production values (the sets, the costumes, etc.) looked authentic for the time, to me at least, but then again I'm no expert on period design (at the very least there seems to be no one running around the film wearing sneakers or a Casio watch).  There are some fairly distasteful sequences (along with gallons of blood), but given the story involves cannibalism it would have been difficult to not show someone actually consuming the flesh of another.  All in all if you can get past the gorier bits you may find this an interesting film, one that doesn't often take itself very seriously (especially given the soundtrack), and features a definite `man vs. himself' theme with a few twists.

This film's been released to DVD twice so far, once in 1999 and again in 2005.  I have the earlier version, the one with a prominent headshot of Guy Pearce (the 2005 release has a headshot of an indistinct face with its mouth wide open) so I'm unsure if the features available on the 1999 version are the same as on the 2005 release.  Anyway, the picture, presented in widescreen (2.35:1) looks very good and the audio, available in both English 5.1 Stereo Surround and Dolby Digital Surround comes across well.  As far as extras there's three, separate commentary tracks, one with director Antonia Bird and composer Damon Albarn, a 2nd with actor Robert Carlyle, and the third with writer Ted Griffin and actor Jeffrey Jones.

1046469,4,6305538972,"Ravenous is about a soldier played by Guy Pierce who finds himself being hunted by a crazy cannibal. Robert Carlyle is bone chilling as the cannibal who won't stop until he has killed and...eaten Pierce and his men. The movie is silly and stupid at times but it's also creepy, disgusting and yes I just couldn't keep my eyes off it. It's engaging and the under-rated Guy Pierce is excellent.

  Caryle manages to be creepy, maybe even as creepy as Anthony Hopkins' as Hannibal Lector. He is a bit over the top though. He dresses like a vampire and almost plays the part as if he is one. Anyway I left out that he eats people because it makes him immortal and also because he has a taste for human beings. Pierce learns that he has to become like him if he wants to survive. He also discovers that Caryle is a soldier too when he gets back to camp. It drives him mad because he's around him all the time and no one believes he is dangerous. It's Pierce who they don't trust and believe is dangerous.

The music is fantastic if you get what it's trying to accomplish.  It adds humor to horror, but not in a stupid way, in a clever way.  This movie is full of excellent one-liners and you'll be wishing everyone knew what you were referring to when you use them.

1046472,5,6305538972,"'Ravenous' is one of the strangest movies I've seen in recent memory.  It could roughly be defined as a horror-comedy, but it's not much like most of the famed examples of the genre, as it is more subtle and less reliant on slapstick, and also just serious more often than most films of this sort.  I think it could stand to be a little more serious overall, as it has some effective, largely unexploited horror concepts which are diminished somewhat by the humor.  (On the other hand, most of the humor *is* funny.)  Still, it's tough to argue with the results, and  this is definitely recommended to horror fans.  (That is, horror fans who are interested in actually seeing something a bit different rather than having the same damn formula repeated yet again.  Don't get me wrong, I like lots of derivative, innovation-free films, but lotsa people seem to demand that exclusively.)

'Ravenous' is about cannibalism, a common enough horror staple, but it looks at it in a different way, avoiding either zombies or savages and exploring the Wendigo myths.  (i.e. The idea that a man could eat other men and grow to crave the flesh, needing more and more, while simultaneously gaining strength the more he eats, eventually becoming nearly superhuman.)  It's also different from most contemporary horror in that it uses a period setting, and an atypical period setting at that, which is 19th century America shortly after the Mexican-American war.  I'm no historian, obviously, but to my untrained eyes the film is quite visually convincing, readily evoking the period as I would imagine it.  (This is especially impressive considering the fairly low, 12 million dollar budget.)  Most of the action takes place in the Sierra Nevadas, which allows for some rather beautiful and striking scenery, which is generally nicely shot. (Well, takes place in the Sierra Nevadas of the mind, anyway.  I believe it was shot in Slovakia.)

Anyway, the plot centers around one Capt. Boyd (Guy Pearce) who, as the film begins, receives a promotion and commendation for bravery after single-handedly capturing a Mexican command post.  Trouble is, he had, in fact, lain down and played dead during the battle, and only acted after being dumped in a pile of the dead.  The blood of his comrades flows into his mouth which causes him to freak out and apparently become somehow rejuvenated, allowing him to capture the post.  His CO knows that he was actually a coward, but he knows it would be unwise to punish him publicly, so he compromises by shipping him off to a remote fort in California, where he and the others are to help those on their way to the coast.  Some time after arriving a gaunt, half-dead man Colqhoun shows up at the fort.  His party came late and was snowed in, and they're eventually reduced to cannibalism.  It's worse than that, however, as one Col. Ives eventually went mad and started killing others for food, which caused Colqhoun to flee.  Boyd, Colqhoun and others return to their cave to investigate, and hopefully save those remaining, if any.  Needless to say, this is when things get really bad.

That's a helluva a lot of plot synopsis, and there's a whole lot more that I don't wanna give away.  The film deserves a lot of credit for not going where you think it's going: After they returned to the cave I assumed that it would be nothing more than a slasher movie at that point, as Ives slowly picks off each of the party members.  This does, in fact, happen, but this is just a fraction of the movie, and I would never have predicted the major plot developments of the second half of the film.

Though I've not really mentioned it much, this film actually has a lot of humor in it.  It's not really derived from the plot for the most part, the film is just filled with bizarre, quirky characters and comic dialogue.  It's not ever a riotously funny movie, but it's amusing, and, of course, also works on a horrific and dramatic level.  Sometimes the balance is off, however.  For example, at a few points Bird (the director) chose to compliment some forest chase scenes with goofy hoe-down music.  This actually manages the make these scenes somewhat lighthearted, but I don't think this really works dramatically, and fail to see the point.  (Especially since there isn't anything humorous about these particular scenes apart from the inappropriate music.)  Still, this misstep only stand out because of how consistently intriguing the film is otherwise.

The acting is excellent all around.  Pearce probably has the most conventional role as our main character Boyd, but he does a fine, convincing job with it.  It's also interesting to see a (sort of) horror movie where the main character is something of a coward and in a relatively realistic way.  (Rather than simply running in terror he tends to become paralyzed with fear and hopelessly indecisive.)  Jeffrey Jones is also a particular standout as Col. Hart, commander of the fort.  He's just funny and likable, if a bit of a doofus, as per usual for him.  (From what I've seen, anyway.)  Robert Carlyle is very good as the mad Ives.  He makes for a villain not quite like any other I've seen.

The film does faulter a little at the end as it degenerates into a big fist-fight which is just somewhat overly drawn out and is a little predictable and standard for a film which had been quite unpredictable beforehand.  It's not bad, by any stretch of the imagination, but I would've hoped for more.

I suspect that upon further viewings my enthusiasm for this film might wane a bit, as it loses its novelty.  (You can never tell how a film will hold up to repeat viewings.  Who knows, maybe I'll like it more.)  Still, it would have to drop off a long way to cease being one of the most original and interesting horror films of the 90's.  Check it out.

1046524,5,6305538972,"There is a huge, hairy, bellicose bellowing beast perched there on the edge of the Sierra Nevadas: a slavering, hungry, big-bellied monster that has slobbered and howled and eaten its way West, gobbling up bankers and railroad tycoons and cowboys and gunslingers and soldiers, tinkers, tailors, spies, the entire Indian Nation and itinerant railroad coolies from Cathay.

Its name is Manifest Destiny---and O Hail Columbia, It's Hungry! It's Hungry for more.

The spirit of consumption, ingestion, devouring the heart of the Enemy and making his strength your own---not only was that the spirit that fired our young Republic's westward march, but it's the same spirit that serves as the guts and glory of ""Ravenous"", a modern anthem to good hearty eating and the pioneer spirit.

More a Weird Wild West vampire tale than anything else, Ravenous entertains in fits and starts---but what atmospheric and blackly funny fits and starts! Ravenous is a decidedly off-beat and undeservedly underrated little horror tale with nice big chunks of frontier adventure, cabin-fever craziness, cannibalism and ghoulishness, Indian devil lore, and shades of the Donner Party, all served in hearty helpings with fine cinematography, glorious sets, sumptuous costumes, and actors who look like they just step out of a 19th century daguerrotype.

Tasty.

Director Antonia Bird distinguished herself with the deft and entertaining but uneven and preachy Priest, which was an effective cinematic diatribe against Catholic orthodoxy. In Ravenous, Bird is not out to preach to anyone, which is what makes the film so much good fun: it is a finely drawn exercise in black humor, unnerving and harrowing (and often eerie) yet also impish and nastily funny. ""Isn't this civilized?,"" asks Jeffrey Jones's revivified Colonel while chowing down on a stew made from the fort's drunken Major, and the answer is, hysterically, yes---civilizingly good cinema about men on the edge getting pushed all the way over it.

Hero Guy Pearce (Memento), whose sturdy cheekbones and Pimpernel-esque diction stole the show in the mediocre Count of Montecristo, plays a strangely understated---and thus doubly effective---role as Captain John Boyd, an American officer decorated for his bravery in the Mexican-American war. But Boyd is not a hero, rather a coward who can barely stand the sight of blood (he gets over it), and whose heroism was largely accidental. The Army Brass knows this but nonetheless needs a hero: Boyd is feted and feasted, treated with a rousing rendition of ""Hail Columbia"" as interpreted by a bunch of psychotic 4th graders, and dispatched to the lonely hinterland outpost Fort Spencer, which sits on the verge of the Sierra Nevada mountains.

Transfer or penance: Boyd barely gets settled down for a long winter's night when the Stranger staggers out of the deep black fierce woods, pushing his stark white face up against the fort windows.

The Stranger(the leering, grinning, slavering Robert Carlyle) bears with him a ravening, Donner-esque tale of a lost party of snowbound travelers, drowned in horror, futility, and death in the snow-choked passes.

Oh, and Cannibalism, did I mention that? People gotta eat.

An expedition party is hastily assembled to search out any survivors: from there our quirky band of misfits---and ""Ravenous""---lurches into a darker domain.

The first half of the film is a blend of paranoid frontier adventure and outright horror, with Carlyle's stranger one of the more terrifying and mysterious fiends in cinematic history. The second half of the movie is considerably less frightening (and thus slightly disappointing, given the first 60 minutes of lead-in and the snippet of Wendigo legend), and Ravenous becomes more of a variation on the standard vampire tale. To say more about the mechanics of this shift would be to spoil the fun.

Ravenous works on so many levels: the rough and forbidding scenery (with Czech mountains doubling for the Sierras) and the capricious score work as characters in their own right. The cinematography is outstanding, and Bird makes good use of the unyielding landscape without and the shadowy and claustrophobic fort interiors (thrown into darkness by the natural light) within.

Finally, the acting is superb, from Jones's bookish Colonel to David Arquette's short but tasty role as a cook (what else?) who inhales a little too much from a peace pipe. Rich in atmosphere, rife with deviltry, stewed and simmered in spicy Manifest Destiny, this film is a fine, hearty stew of a horror movie. Dig in.

1046525,5,6305538972,"I enjoyed this movie. I think you should watch it. However, don't expect to be moved by it or gain anything from it. One thing for sure, it is not a movie like any other one you've watched.

Ravenous is based on a Native American folklore called weendigo. That is if a man consumes another man's flesh, the man also consumes his strength. Hence, the consumer's hunger becomes insatiable. He keeps on wanting more (more human flesh) and the only way to stop this is death.

The main character Boyd, played convincingly by Guy Pearce,  experiences weendigo on the battlefield during the war against Mexico. He hides under a pile of dead men out of cowardice, unintentionally swallows blood dripping from a dead soldier on top, and hence gains strength and single-handedly conquers the Mexican command, thereby becoming a hero by being a coward.

He tells his commanding officer about this and the disappointed officer stations him in Fort Spencer, a post in the isolated snow-covered area in or near California. The post consists of several very odd characters, including a funny commanding officer played by Jeffrey Jones, a very religious soldier, a hard-core maniac soldier, two Native Americans, a drunk, and some total weirdo played by David Arquette (couldn't figure out that character, perhaps he was on drugs).

Soon the group is joined by Calhoun, a cannibalistic officer also possessed by Weendigo. Now, can Boyd become a true hero and save the group from Calhoun?

The movie has some pretty cool scenes. One that stands out is when Calhoun reveals his identity as a cannibal and chases Boyd and other members of the company along the mountain with some fun harmonica music. The fight scene between Boyd and Calhoun at the end was also convincing.

Anyway, it is a fun entertainment. Just check it out.",1107734400,4,1810,4.895424836601308
1046526,5,6305538972,"Ravenous is a very clever movie and a good one at that.. It is a classic generally in the sense of other genres with sick twisted humor. It is certainly not for the faint of heart and one can make the assertion that everyone is not going to like the movie. I presume those not accustomed to gratuitous gore and the subject matter..Ahem ""stew"" will be offended.

Still, there is something to be said of Robert Carlyle's (trainspotting's begbie) chilling performance as the maniacal Colqhoun. The transformation from the frostbitten stranger to the cold and calculating Colqhoun (Wendigo) is very disturbing.

 Robert Carlyle's Colqhoun is the epitome of pure unadulterated evil. ******* Brilliant! (The character is that good and cool so much so you actually root for the next kill.. ahem meal) A five star alone just for the cave scene and the startling music as Colqhoun closes down on the prey or preys as in plural. I think the chase scene has a mixture of strange banjo and some other instruments in the score.  Nonetheless, it is very startling!

The scene with Jeffrey Jones C.O. (Quite some shock from the inept headmaster in Ferris. B to a cannibal) in the short utter ""He was licking me!"" is most appalling in a very funny and I might add twisted way. This movie is dark and there are other movies not exactly in the same genre but european and with just enough gore (See.. lock, stock and 2 smoking B..)

The movie is an acquired taste and no doubt, many will find the voracious appetite of Colqhoun for human flesh horrifying!

When I come across strange movies, it is usually a comedy or satire. However, this movie is completely serious. How many cannibal movies do you come across that is a combination of unique/serious/good? Not many, I bet.

I first saw this movie in 1999 and I was shocked speechless. It was truly a sight to behold. The characters were great, the music was excellent, and the story kept me interested from beginning to end. It wasn't just these qualities that made it great, but the atmosphere and the setting really came through.

The setting is Fort Spencer, 1840's. The man we focus on? Boyd. He was a celebrated officer, but only because he played dead to capture the enemy commander. His superior was disgusted and sent him to Fort Spencer. There, he thought he might have found some peace among the band of mismatched people. However, a man in ragged clothing soon comes into the fort with a desperate tale of cannibalism. Things may not be as they seem, though.

I was really captivated by this movie, but two things really bothered me.

WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD!

During a part of the movie, Boyd finds out the truth about Ives, and tries to kill him. However, this stupid Indian woman believes that Boyd must die if Ives die, and she stops every attempt he makes to kill Ives. Now, killing Ives would be a good thing, so why the hell is she stopping him? Does she want to be killed? Or is she just an idiot? This is a rather poor plot point.

Another thing that bothered me was Ives' desire for companionship. Now, he knew fully well that Boyd is dangerous, and should not be kept around, yet he keeps him alive. Colonel Hart would have been enough, but by keeping Boyd around, Ives put himself in trouble. Perhaps this was a part of his psychology and he really wanted to die, but was too afraid to commit suicide. However, the movie didn't give any clear indication of this or anything else, in my opinion.

END SPOILERS

1046589,3,6305538972,"There are many wonderful things about this movie. The cinematography is expert, the set design and costuming are convincingly detailed, and the major performances are all top-notch. The script has been modified and reduced to what I think is its most effective possible form. These factors combine in a manner that should be a terrific (and terrifying) movie experience. However, it doesn't quite work. The fault lies in the post-production, which presents the movie to the audience in an inappropriate way.

Early in the commentary track by the director, Antonia Bird, and the composer, Damon Albarn, Bird refers to this movie as ""a satire"". This movie is a period piece about murder and worse, set in a remote part of the American frontier - what exactly is it supposed to be satirising? Cannibalism? The mind boggles. This error of intent is a clue to the problem with this film.

In the same commentary, Albarn continually describes this movie as looking very ""European"", as opposed to American (i.e. the United States and Hollywood in particular). His disdain is obvious: ""European"" film is synonymous with quality, perceptiveness, and depth, as opposed to ""American"" crudity, ignorance, and shallowness. The validity of his prejudice could be debated at length. The problem, however, is that this opinion has led to the creation of a musical soundtrack which is inappropriately ironic in tone.

During moments that should evoke great horror, revulsion and fear in the audience, the music remains above it all, with a dismissive ""what fools these mortals be"" attitude. Additionally, Albarn's pop music roots betray him: his music certainly is interesting, catchy and memorable (I found myself recalling several parts of it the next day), but it continually calls attention to itself, not only with its inappropriate attitude, but also with bizarre instrument choices, and vocal parts that confuse the viewer, who is unsure whether the voices originate from the characters or the music.

These problems continually pull the viewer out of the movie, telling them that they must watch with ironic detachment rather than emotional involvement, but the movie itself doesn't justify this attitude. It is _not_ a satire, but rather a period horror movie, which admittedly has a strong streak of black humour.

This misunderstanding led to a problem discovered during test screenings - the previewers said that they were didn't know whether they were supposed to laugh at the movie or not. As noted above, this was the result of an inappropriate soundtrack. This fact was not recognised by the producers, who went in the opposite direction, trying to match the movie to its soundtrack. They inserted the comic ""Eat me"" quote at the beginning, married the title caption to a shot of the hero vomiting, and presented the rest of the credits in a similarly ""zany"" way - they whoosh on and off the screen like exhibitionist skiers.

This movie did not need sign-posts indicating ""wacky ironic subtext!"" What it needed was a dense orchestral score, a-la Jerry Goldsmith, to complement the eerie visuals and horrifying set pieces - amplifying this film's disturbing themes, not undermining them, and trusting the dark humour to look after itself. I don't anticipate anyone bothering to produce a suitable soundtrack, and reissue the film in a new, improved edition.

1046593,4,6305538972,"I saw in the pro reviews that this movie had mistakenly been passed for dark comedy and flopped anyway. I understand it. This movie flopped because it's very very special and is not appealing for a large audience.
I discovered this movie by chance and mistake : I was with a friend who loves cinema and we wanted to see a movie, this one was on show, and we chose it by chance (well, maybe *she* had heard of it or of the realisator). It was a shock. This film may have some humor, but it is first and foremost gore, heck, it made a major meat eater like me a vegetarian for a fortnight.
well, this said, it is excellently made, and I enjoyed it tremendously. it does show a very interesting angle on cannibalism, and I think I remember something about the legend of the Wendigo. (heck, I wish I could see it again, but I got no budget for DVDs, want to gift me with it?). For the strong of stomach, but a real good piece",1079481600,,921,4.150837988826815
1046594,4,6305538972,"This is a very difficult movie to review. How do I explain a movie about cannibalism? Which is exactly what this movie centers on. When this film came out, 20th Century Fox advertised this like it was a dark comedy. While it does have it's share or quirky moments, it's not a comedy. This is a gore picture, plain and simple. Oh and did I mention the cannabalism?
Guy Pierce plays a misunderstood 'war-hero'. During the Spanish-American war (this film is set in 1840), while on the battlefield, he took over the Spanish command post of the area he was fighting in. What he didn't mention to everyone, was that he did it out of cowardice. During the battle, he played dead on the battlefield and was buried with his dead companions in a large trailer full of bodies. He then spent the next few days drinking his commanding officers blood running down from his half-blown off head. After drinking this blood, he then escapes and takes over the command post.
After being awarded a medal for his actions, he is sent to Fort Spencer. You see, his general (John Spencer) knows what really happened and wants him nowhere near his troops. So, he is sent to the middle of nowhere in the snowy mountains of Nevada (or so they say in the film). Fort Spencer is being watched over by 7 people. Each has their own characteristics and are actually quite interesting.
One night they are paid a visit by a wandering stranger (Robert Carlyle) who is on the verge of death. He then tells them all a story about cannabalism. It seems that the party he was with, got caught in the storm and seeked shelter in a cave. One of the males then preceeded to eat everyone. He mentions there might be survivors. Some of the people of Fort Spencer then plan to travel to the cave to look for these survivors. And that's where the story really begins to kick in.
I won't give away the details, but it has a couple nice twists to it and you get great performances from Guy Pearce and Robert Carlyle. After you see Carlyle in this, you will never look at him the same again. The supporting actors are also quite good. David Arquette, however, makes me want to hit him every time I see him act. But contrary to the advertisment campaign, he is not in the film that much.
If you have a weak stomach, I would recommend not watching this movie. While it isn't a horror movie, per se, it's definately got many grusome images. It's really a movie that doesn't fit into and ONE genre. It has some quirky comedy. It definately can creep you out at time. It's very gory. But, the main core of the movie is centered around cannabalism and some old Indian myth of a 'Wendigo'. Apparently a Wendigo is a person who has ate the flesh of man and then gets a undeniable hunger for it. He has to kill and eat man to quench his thirst. The thirst will never go away and for every human you eat, you consume their spirit. In essence you grow very strong, heal much faster and feel better than you ever have. It's quite interesting & disturbing at the same time.
I don't feel this film was given a fair shot at the box office. The advertising was way off and gave you the wrong idea. Then again, how do you advertise a movie that is centered around man eating the flesh of another man? This is a VERY original movie, and that is rare in these days of Hollywood cookie-cutter type movies. I would definately give it a rent. It's not for everyone, though.
The DVD comes with 3 commentary tracks, deleted scenes, tv spots, photo galleries, and costume & set designs. Not a bad batch of supplements considering this isn't even a 'special edition'.",1073520000,2,3592,4.419306184012067
1046595,5,6305538972,"If you know anything about the storied history of this film, you find yourself amazed and pleased, even after the nine-thousandth viewing, that it turned out as well as it did.
What with Antonia Bird serving as the replacement for RAVENOUS' first director, Milcho Manchevski, and the eleventh-hour addition of the marvelous Robert Carlyle, it's no surprise that the plot and tone are schizoid as they are. And just the fact that the score was co-composed by avant-garde specialist Michael Nyman and former BLUR frontman Damon Albarn, speaks volumes about what the wary (or unwary) cinematic *CONSUMER* should expect.
Which is a ride not for the faint-of-heart or the squeamish. Captain John Boyd (Pearce) has just received an award for bravery, for a heroic act of valor performed during a battle in the Spanish-American War. Only he, his superior officer, Gen. Slauson (WEST WING'S John Spencer) and the audience know that he's a lily-livered coward at heart. He was only able to capture an enemy outpost after playing dead under a stack of the bodies of his butchered comrades.
Disgusted with him, but well aware that political correctness won't allow him to have a war hero tried and executed for cowardice under fire, Slauson does the next best thing...he has Boyd ""reassigned"" to what could be seen as the American answer to the Gulag...Fort Spencer, out in the middle of hell-and-gone, somewhere in California, by way of the same route that the Donner party was unlucky enough to take, (making you wonder if maybe they ran into somebody in this movie!)
Anyway, our outcast war hero finds the fort manned by a colorful cast of misfits: Col. Hart (Jeffrey Jones), as bookish and erudite as you wouldn't expect the commander of a hole in the sticks to be; Private Toffler (Jeremy Davies), a man as devoutly religious as he is sweetly and inherently inept; outpost sawbones Major Knox (Stephen Spinella), who takes the phrase ""Physician, Heal Thyself"" literally, staying liberally medicated with anything that comes 100 proof from a bottle; the muscularly malevolent Private Reich (Neal McDonough), who proves that one can take being ""all that you can be"" too far indeed, and Pvt. Cleaves (David Arquette), the Old West's answer to the resident slacker, who believes his goal in life is discovering ""better living through chemistry"" in every way the fort can provide.
Rounding off the group is George (Joseph Running Fox) the local guide and Cleaves' peyote-and-peace-pipe partner, and his sister Martha (Sheila Tousey), who brings as much of a woman's touch to daily life at Spencer as this crew is likely to get.
Not long after Boyd's arrival, a haggard stranger stumbles into their midst, half-dead from fright, exposure and starvation. Introducing himself as the Rev. F.W. Colquohon, (Robert Carlyle), he explains how he came to be there, regaling the men of Fort Spencer with a tale of misfortune, murder and cannibalism that would give Stephen King the willies.
Alarmed by the possibility that some of the people Colquohon was traveling with may still be alive, Col. Hart and his men immediately set off on a rescue mission...which is where the fun of RAVENOUS really begins. Throw in deception, more murder, more cannibalism and just a touch of the supernatural, via an arcane Native American legend, and you're in for a stomach-churnin', knee-slappin' good time!
It's a damn shame that Fox didn't know (and probably didn't care about) how to sell this, because it's a cult hit sleeper in waiting if there ever was one. Sly commentary about everything from rampant consumerism and ""manifest destiny,"" to male-bonding of a different kind abounds between fits of gore and grue, and a game cast sinks its teeth into some characterizations as unforgettably vivid as the fast-paced story will allow them to be.
Kudos especially to Carlyle, whose Colquohon will stick in your memory long after the last tasty, twangy note of the engagingly oddball soundtrack has faded away.
More's the pity that a featurette about the making of the movie and the soundtrack is not included. To say that there isn't anything else like it would usually be regarded as a cheap cliche. In this case, it's a (gross) understatement about a film worth every bit of your time. If you're...HUNGRY for something different....",1071705600,10,4302,5.0181818181818185
1046596,5,6305538972,"I saw this on cable and needed to get my own copy, that's how good I think it is.
I especially adore Robert Carlyle, or his character rather....It's a delicious blend of horror and dark humor. About the Native American legend of the Wendigo, a supernatural entity with an unsatiable appetite for human flesh.
Robert Carlyle plays the Weendigo. He's a man who hears that consuming human flesh might restore his failing health, and decides to test the legend. With extraordinary and scary results. By eating human flesh he can recover from even the most fatal of wounds.

Possessed by a ravenous appetite he turns up as the traumatized only survivor of a band of pioneers which elasped into horror, when they were snowed-in a cave, without food.
Guy Pearce, plays Captain John Boyd, a soldier who served in the Mexican-American war of 1847, during battle he froze with fear and played dead, that way he was able to get behind enemy lines and take over from that side. He's given an award for bravery, but since the brass know about his cowardice he's sent, ashamed and haunted by nightmares to Fort Spencer in California, in cold February. The fort serves as a way station for travelers. At the fort there are only 8 people including Captain Boyd. Private Toffler (Jeremy Davies), who's the religious emissary at the fort, Major Knox (Stephen Spinella), who's dead drunk most of the time, Lieutenant Reich (Neal McDonough) who's kind of a crazed soldier/ rambo type,  2 Native Americans: Martha and her brother George (Sheila Tousey and Joseph Running Fox), Private Cleaves (David Arquette) who cooks and goofs off and Colonel Hart (Jeffrey Jones) who's in charge. On his first night, a mysterious traveler shows up, with a terrible tale of cannibalism. When they investigate, horror ensues.
Excellent performances, wonderfrul script, beautiful cinematography, some fun dark humor. Robert Carlyle's fascinating in his characters transformation from supposedly traumatised survivor, to wild predator to super suave gentleman. Either way he's delectable. ;-) I really like the music too.",1067904000,3,2083,5.087719298245614
1046637,5,6305538972,"John Boyd finds himself in a distinctly unenviable position at the beginning of ""Ravenous."" Boyd, an army officer recently promoted for heroism in the Mexican War, is really a coward at heart. During action in that campaign, the young officer folded in the face of enemy fire, a deed that cost the lives of several of his men. Left for dead in a pile of bloody corpses by Mexican soldiers, Boyd managed to pull himself together and capture an enemy command post. Rather than have a supposed ""hero"" shot for dishonorable activities, an act that may not have the best results on general morale, the general commanding the army exiles Boyd to an out of the way heap of sticks in the wilds of California called Fort Spencer. Perhaps Captain Boyd should have fought bravely in Mexico because what he runs up against in California is enough to make the hardiest soul cry for his mother. ""Ravenous"" as a film slices across so many genre boundaries that it is difficult in the extreme to classify it. At turns gross out horror, serious drama, and social critique, even the studio had an impossible task while marketing this project. I vividly remember the television spots for ""Ravenous,"" and at the time I couldn't make heads or tails of what this movie was about.
When Boyd arrives at Fort Spencer, he quickly discovers that he now lives in a place inhabited by various castoffs from the military. There is the commanding officer of the place, Colonel Hart, a bookish figure who spends his time reading Plato in the original Greek while cracking walnuts on his desk with a huge tome. Major Knox serves as the fort physician even though his training is in veterinary science. His favorite activity is drinking himself into unconsciousness every chance he gets. The preacher of the outfit looks like he would be more at home wandering the back alleys of a cesspool, as does the perpetually dense Private Cleaves. The only guy with any backbone in the outfit is the soldierly Private Reich, one of those gung ho types so annoying to people just trying to take it easy. Rounding out this bunch of miscreants are two local Indians. Director Antonia Bird does a marvelous job of fleshing out each one of these characters with a minimum of time and effort, but ultimately the stellar cast makes each of these unique individuals come alive. I won't go any further than mentioning the absolute majesty of Robert Carlyle's performance as Colquhoun. His telling of that gruesome story around the campfire never loses its intensity no matter how many times you watch the film. The cast in ""Ravenous"" is simply spectacular.
Shortly after Boyd arrives at Fort Spencer, a straggler nearly dying of malnourishment wanders into the camp. Introducing himself as an itinerant preacher named Colquhoun, he tells a riveting story of murder, madness, and cannibalism to the fort personnel. It seems Colquhoun and a party of settlers failed to get out of the mountains before the winter storms set in, and after several miserable weeks slowly starving in a cave the settlers began eating one another in order to survive. Hart decides he must follow up on this strange story by launching an expedition into the surrounding mountains to look for the cave. ""Ravenous"" takes off like a jet plane at this point, as the expedition discovers a few shocking secrets about Colquhoun during the course of their mission. Apparently, the preacher became what the local Indians refer to as a Wendigo, a man transmogrified into a ravenous creature after devouring human flesh. Now Boyd and company must deal with the fallout from their encounter with this eerie being.
The movie takes so many twists and turns from this discovery onwards that it would be a crime if I should spoil it for you. If Bird had decided to just make this a cannibal picture, it still would have entertained the horror crowd. Fortunately, she decided to use Algernon Blackwood's Wendigo legend as a thinly veiled metaphor for what the American government did in the western part of the continent during the nineteenth century. At one point during the film, Colquhoun crows to Boyd about the idea of ""manifest destiny"" and how the settlers will pour into California as soon as spring arrives, at which time the cannibals will feed off these hapless dupes. Why not tie the eating of human flesh with the economic appetites of the American people? Modern day Indians certainly could tell a tale or two about this seemingly disparate comparison.
The DVD version of ""Ravenous"" fires on all cylinders. Not only do you get the movie in widescreen, you also get THREE commentary tracks, a trailer, deleted scenes with and without commentary, an easter egg, and storyboards about how the crew made the character's outfits and built Fort Spencer. Filming took place in Slovakia, of all places, and the scenery awes with its sweeping mountains and deep forests. My only complaint with the disc concerns the absence of separate audio tracks for the Michael Nyman and Damon Albarn soundtrack. Imagine a mix of folksy banjo with modern techno music and you have an idea of this film's intriguing aural backdrop. The fusion of these two odd musical genres might concern some people, but don't worry because the soundtrack works wonders in ""Ravenous,"" often making a terrifying scene even creepier by infinite degrees. Bird's little film may well be one of the best films of the 1990s, and is certainly one of the best horror films of that decade. As flavorful as the special stew Colquhoun cooks up for his fellow cannibals, ""Ravenous"" will continue to win fans for years to come.",1067126400,6,5597,4.849529780564263

Yes, this is certainly one of the best movies to come out in recent years.  It bombed at the box office(naturally), though it only had a limited relesase in your local arthouse theater.  This movie is quite unique because it takes B movie subject matter and lifts it to the next level through great performances, writing and directing.  I guess you could say a B+ or A- movie.  It's always wonderful to have a movie like this sneak it's way onto screens among all the Hollywood ""horror"" garbage out there-LIKE REMAKES OF THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE AND SUCH!!!  The sad thing is, nobody will see this film unless they take a gamble at the video store or have a creepy friend into ""weird"" movies to suggest it to them.  This movie's one fun ride of gruesomness and dark humor.  In fact, for the first fifteen minutes you're unsure if the film's supposed to be a comedy or not, then you're slammed with some very intense violence.  The film puts a bit of the supernatural(for lack of a better word) into the whole cannibalism mythology-makes cannibalism part of Native american folklore.  A strange idea that eating human flesh can make you superhuman, heal injuries, and become addictive.  Far fetched for sure, but who knows?  Are you about to try and see if there's truth to that?  Do you hang out with cannibal tribes?  The two leads give two of the best performances of their careers but will never be recognized for it.  A pity.

1046641,5,6305538972,"This is going to sound strange, but ""Ravenous"" is a very intelligent movie about cannibals, vampirism (of an unusual sort) and the history of the west. At it's heart is a metaphor about power, exploitation, and ravenous greed. It is much more than simply a thriller, horror, slasher picture.
It is set during the time of westward expansion in the youthful United States, which is significant for discovering what the movie is all about. This movie wouldn't make sense in 20th century Manhattan, or in 1930s Chicago. It is set during a time when european settlers still had a long way to go towards 'conquering' most of North America.
Without giving too much away of the bizarre and twisted plot, the movie explores not only cannibalism, but cannibalism as a means of regaining life, energy, or power. You eat another, you take the life energy of that person. This notion of cannabalism (which is more along the lines of mythology than of a slasher movie) allows the movie to be completely unpredictable, disturbing and poignant all at once. At the end of the movie, one realizes that it would've been almost impossible to have guessed what was going to happen at each plot turn. If you enjoy bizarre, almost surreal surprises, this movie is packed with them.
The crucial moment in the film is towards the end when Robert Carlyle's character is rhapsodizing about ""manifest destiny."" Here it is revealed that what's behind the ravenous hunger depicted in the film is a statement about how the west was won, and perhaps still being won. There's a lot in this film to chew on (it's impossible to avoid stupid puns when writing about movies in which people are eaten, sorry), and ""Ravenous"" does not belong in the same category as B-slashers or gore or shock flicks.
In fact, it's almost impossible to determine what category to put ""Ravenous"" in. People who avoid gore movies will probably also want to avoid this one (it can be pretty disgusting), and people who enjoy gore and slash will probably feel disappointed because there's simply more going on than random and senseless killing. It's no surprise that this movie bombed, and it will probably gain cult status and continue to confuse most viewers, but for that reason it will probably be around for a while.
The performances are great all around, but Robert Carlyle really, really shines. The story is so original it nearly defies categorization, and the opening sequence is one of the best I've ever seen. The music is meant to be off-kilter and dissonant, which adds to the film's offbeat tempo.
Overall a great movie, but one that may confuse viewers. It's not a comedy (though it is funny), it's not a slasher/thriller (though it is gorey and thrilling), and it's not a western (though it is set in the right era). The best thing to do is see it and find out. You may hate it, or you may never be able to stop thinking about it. There are not many movies like this out there.",1049587200,156,2934,4.699029126213592
1046642,3,6305538972,"just because I gave this 3 stars does not mean you should miss this film. Its actually very close to 4 stars, but it has its flaws. First, I found some of the soundtrack at times distracting and misplaced. Sometimes the soundtrack is great and hard hitting, but sometimes a great scene is flawed by an annoying banjo hobo tune. Also this films really lags for the first 15-20 minutes of the movie and the ending although not bad is less then thought provoking and great.
  This movie doesnt do anything to stir emotion, but its fun to watch. Robert Carlyle is so amazing as the evil loving villian! Guy Pearce is also amazing although his part wasn't complicated. Jeffrey Jones(from ferris bueller) and David Arquette are not well casted in this films even though they tried. Jeffrey Jones is too much like my uncle to come off as a believable evil character. David Arquette cant seem to play anything but the idiot in films and TV and didn't go well in this movie, but thankfully he wasn't in it much. thats about it for any problems I had with the film.
  Otherwise, I was pleased with this film. I love movies with evil characters who love to have fun while being evil(like Jack Nicholson in ""The Shining"" or Mark Walberg in ""FEAR"") Robert Carlyle is awesome and delivers a 5 star performance as the villian. This is the first time I have seen him in any film and I must say that Im an instant fan.
  I gave it 3 stars, but its a film that you need to see if you love evil thrillers. Its a bit visually graphic and I recommend this film for mature teens and up.

I actually wrote on Ravenous for a film class (I called it a revisionist western, I don't think that's too much of a stretch).  The film is full of great performances (especially, I think, from Pearce who is turning out to be a great actor) and the direction is very suitable for creating a dark but tongue in cheek mood.  And let's not forget the music.  Along with Dead Man, I think Ravenous has one of the best scores of the 1990s.  It's both haunting and hillarious.  And I often find myself humming it.

But when a mysterious stranger (Carlyle) arrives with a chilling tale of cannibalism in the wilderness and they set out on a rescuse mission to find the remaining survivors things start spiralling out of all proportion.
As weird as it is bizarrely gripping, 'Ravenous' is also genuinely horrific and there are scenes which will make even the most strong-stomached viewers look away.  It's a strange mixture of disgusting gore and comedy that will definitely make you laugh, albeit nervously.  There's also a strong vampiric feel to the film (especially in Carlyle's excellent performance) and the expected sexual imagery to go with the cannibalism.  There's even an eclectic bluegrass score worked on by Damon Albarn, ;ead singer in British indie group Blur.
Pearce again turns in a magnificent performance that could easily have fallen into self-parody, and Carlyle is great fun.

It is those visuals which make it unsuitable to viewers with weak stomachs, because the violence is very graphic indeed.
The date is about 1850. Captain John Boyd [Guy Pearce] has been deeply traumatized by a particularly bloody battle during the Mexican-American War. His commanding officer, appalled by Boyd's apparent lack of courage, assigns him to a small and unimportant fort in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. He finds that the small group of soldiers there are outcasts. One bitterly cold night, a nearly dead stranger is found in the snow. They revive him and ask him how he came to be lost in the wilderness. His name is Colquhoun, and, as played by the brilliant Scottish actor Robert Carlisle, he is one of the weirdest creatures the movie's have invented lately. He says that he was traveling west with a small group of pioneers. The journey took longer than expected, and they became trapped by the mountains' harsh winter weather. Although they found refuge in a cave, their supplies were inadequate for such a long delay. Finally, they killed the horses and ate them. Then one member of the group died. Afterwards, Colquhoun claims he went out foraging. When he returned, he found the group cooking the deceased. After hearing this grisly story, the fort's commander decides that a search party must go out to look for survivors.
Tales of people resorting to cannibalism in such desperate situations are not new, but Colquhoun's story is only the start of this chilling movie. Things get much worse as the story takes its surprising twists and turns. No one is safe. I am rarely frightened by a movie, but this one gave me a definite case of the creeps.
Much of the success of Ravenous is due to Robert Carlisle. Without him, it might have been nothing more than mere sensationalism. Carlisle often plays appealing, lovable characters. Here he gives us a portrait of a psychotic and creates a character that you will not soon forget. His Colquhoun is somewhat like Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lector in The Silence of the Lambs, although each actor's interpretation was uniquely his own.
The photography captures the vastness and majesty of the American West. The set built for the fort seems very authentic. The music adds to the mystic tone of the movie. First rate character actors fill out the cast.
While Ravenous is one of the best thrillers of the year, it is not, shall we say, to everyone's taste.",1016668800,13,2799,4.77319587628866

There are two general mindframes on this movie. One is that it is a dark and stylish mix of horror and the blackest of humor (my personal opinion), and the second is that it is only a disguised vampire movie, with a bad plot, a preachy director, and poor performances. There are a couple ways to tell if you are going to like it. One, if you like Robert Carlyle of Guy Pearce (and I'm a huge Guy Pearce fan) then this movie is for you. Both of them deliver powerful performances, and anyone that says they aren't right for the movie is just plain wrong. Pearce has started to make a career out of being a man who won't allow himself to be a victim (LA Confidential, Memento) and in this movie he makes you understand that even when everything [is bad], you still have to stick to what you believe in. Robert Carlyle is absolutely delightful as the bad guy in the movie, playing the role of the smart maniac that most actors can't seem to nail down without overacting. But this movie has talent through and through, with Jeremy Davies, Jeffrey Jones, even David Arquette offering all their best performances to this one movie. There must be something very freeing working with director Antonia Bird.
The acting does indeed make the movie. There is quite a bit of gore in this (not by my standards, but that's alright) and the idea of cannabalism is played around with quite a bit. There's also an underlying vein of humor that many of the professional critics either miss completely or catch only the obvious parts. The movie is very black and very stylish. Another great thing about it is the music. John Williams on his best day could not have written a score that would fit as well with this movie as Michael Nyman did. The music plays to the very heart of the movie... serious, yet off kilter...
The DVD is even better than the movie, because you get to hear commentary by the director, the screenwriter, and Robert Carlyle and Jeffrey Jones. There is nothing quite as good as hearing commentary on a movie you love by the people that made it. You learn to appreciate it all that more.
So try this movie out. Rent it first, see if you like it. And if you do, odds are you will end up buying it... I figure why not. Give it a whirl, at the very least, you'll come away with an impression. And in today's business of bland movies that you don't really care what happens, just receiving ANY sort of an impression is enough to warrant it attention.",1015113600,,2451,4.41280353200883

1046705,4,6305538972,"Even in the film genre of horror, cannibalism seems to be somewhat taboo.  However, its scarcity on the silver screen seems to be due less to censorship and more to the difficulty in dealing with the subject in a literate and--ahem!--tasteful manner.  With that in mind, 1999's RAVENOUS is definitely a rare and delectable treat.
One of the best things about RAVENOUS is its dreary ambiance.  The dismal tone of the subject matter is established right from the beginning, when the film's protagonist, Captain John Boyd (Guy Pearce)--a reluctant hero of the Mexican-American War (1846-1848)--is banished to a dilapidated , middle-of-nowhere Army outpost in the Sierra Nevadas as a punishment for cowardice.  In addition to being coldly isolated from the civilized world, the outpost is staffed by a wildly eccentric group of characters who, like Boyd, have obviously been stationed there to keep them out of the way.
Not long after Boyd's arrival at the fort, a seemingly malnourished stranger (Robert Carlyle) staggers onto the grounds spouting a story about snowbound travelers, starvation, and cannibalism.  When he hints that there might yet be survivors at his gruesome campsite, Boyd's commanding officer, Colonel Hart (Jeffrey Jones), leads his motley crew on a rescue mission.  And, of course, this is when the film gets to the ""meat"" of the story....
Now, all of this may sound like the set-up for a rather grim movie, and while RAVENOUS is indeed rather grisly at times, it is also dotted with lots of wry funeral-parlor humor.  In fact, under its ensanguined facade, RAVENOUS is really a biting satire (excuse the pun) that takes rapier-like jabs at things such as modern material consumption and contemporary moral and political expediency.  And in its use of generally repulsive concepts and imagery to make the audience feel just a bit queasy about paradoxical Western social philosophy, RAVENOUS succeeds quite well.
Although it is a good film, not every viewer will enjoy RAVENOUS.  Some horror fans may be put off by the ironic humor and sociological subtext, and many mainstream viewers will simply not be able to see far enough beyond the gore to even find the humor and subtext.  However, for film aficionados who have a palate for satire or horror of any flavor, RAVENOUS can be quite succulent.",1010620800,2,2315,5.068421052631579
1046706,2,6305538972,"It's generally not worth the bother to review a ""cult movie"" unless you're a certified member of the cult in question.  This is especially true of _Ravenous_, a hybrid of the Western and the splatter flick.  Since I happen to enjoy both Westerns and splatter flicks, you'd think this would be my cup of tea.
Nope.  Not even close.
The biggest problem with _Ravenous_ is that it doesn't know it's cinematic trash.  Instead, the film attempts to offer an American history lesson.  Fat chance of getting any fascinating historical tidbits here, though.  History buffs will be quick to point out the film's ludicrous inaccuracies and anachronisms, starting with the design of the Army fort.  (This would probably be the best way for most viewers to remain awake, but why bother?)
Meanwhile, the plot degenerates into a ham-handed, know-nothing message about Anglo-American conquest and domination of the West.  The insistent left-wing moralizing should come as no surprise to anyone familiar with director Antonia Bird's oeuvre.  In the end, _Ravenous_ comes across as self-important twaddle.  Worse, it's just plain dull.
Western/horror hybrids have been doomed ever since Billy the Kid met Dracula, and this one's no exception.  But I'll add two extra stars for Guy Pearce's understated performance, some nice cinematography (of the mountainous Czech Republic, where _Ravneous_ was filmed) and one of the best musical scores in recent years.

1046707,5,6305538972,"Underrated, this is a hardcore, dark, macabre masterpiece. Guy Pearce (Captain John Boyd) is a soldier, who, though decorated, is actually a coward. After faking death in a battle against Mexicans, he is tossed among the dead in the enemy's encampment. He crawls out from a beneath a pile of oozing bodies and successfully takes the base from the enemy. His commander knows he isn't a real soldier and so, as he is disgusted by the sight of him but for politics sake can't reprimand him, the captain is sent to an isolated military outpost called Fort Spencer. Living there is a skeleton crew assisted by several indians and everything goes fine until a near dead man(Robert Carlyle) staggers into camp during the middle of a very cold winter. After being warmed up and fed, he tells a grisly tale of desperate cannibalism as he and the party he was traveling with got punished by the elements and were forced into a cave. A select small band soldiers and one indian set out to assist the remaining people in the cave, who by chance might just still be alive and so the movie truly begins. Nothing is quite what it seems as the twists and turns reveal the terrifying realities of the plot which eventually climax in a very satisfying and unexpected ending. The acting is excellent all around but especially with Guy Pearce and Robert Carlyle. The weak nature and mental struggles of Guy Pearce are incredibly believable and completely balance the innocent appearance yet sinister nature of Robert Carlyle. The cinematography creates a creepy, desolate atmosphere as the ingenious soundtrack(as good or better than that of Suspiria) by Damon Albarn and Michael Nyman truly fits ever scene and action, allowing for a true horror experience to be felt.

1046709,4,6305538972,"Ravenous is a simple translation of the vampire myth to the setting of America in the 1800's. Not exceptionally original, yet better, perhaps, than a standard vampire movie for the treatment it gives the underlying philosophy.
A vampire movie or story can be approached in two ways, either as horror, or as an a semi-enjoyable fantasy story with trappings of lustful behavior and violence. The Vampire myth itself is an entirely different matter. Human beings in history are able to treat each other like prey animals. There are numerous cases of this kind of behavior, perhaps the most famous being the stories of Vlaad the Impaler (from which the legend of Dracula is drawn) who drank blood from goblets.
It is the philosophical position in a primitive setting that might makes right. This position is mitigated only by the fact that human beings have extensive instincts towards socialization which cause them to band together in a common cause. In a situation where resources are limited (that is to say, reality), human beings compete against other creatures for those resources; violently, forcefully, and with finality. Whe humans form overarching social structures, they become, psychologically, much like a single organism, with wishes and interests serving not just themselves, but their group. When groups come into conflict, they conflict as different creatures--as different species; similar to ants. Cannibalism is the natural extension of this underlying attitude. The destruction of the enemy in an environment of limited resources is less destructive if the dead or captured are reclaimed as food. The nagging suspicion that human beings are all part of the same species prevents most groups from cannibalism, but reduced to desperation, many groups will pursue that course. The vampire is a civilized exploration of that avenue. The concept being that not only will the destruction of an enemy result in your survival, but also in strength--in eternal life. The duality lying in the punishments you recieve--inability to go out during the day, the lust which keeps you apart from humanity forever.
A vampire story is all well and good, but it romanticized; a victorian concept of the cannibal. In Ravenous, the basic themes are brought to the fore with simpler superstitions (such as native american lore about cannibal tribes) which ties much more closely to real human cannibalism. The added mysticism creates the literary edge to bring these issues out in the story.
The story itself might be thought of as horror, but this is not strictly the case. Ravenous catalogues the travels of a civil war veteran who, after accidentally drinking the blood of the dead when he's shoved under a pile of wounded from battle, discovers the hidden strength, or what-have-you that another man's flesh can bring. He is reassigned to the frontier and meets there another cannibal. The struggle which then takes place is that of a decision: are men in separate commmunities which are themselves separate organisms or are all men humans who should not prey on each other, but should collectively work to overcome obstacles such as limited resources.
This movie is not for people who are offended by the consumption of human or the sight of blood. It is probably intended as a horror movie, and therefor is frightening to many. I personally enjoy it. The soundtrack particularly as a clumsiness which is startlingly appropriate.",997056000,4,3430,5.148745519713262
1046710,5,6305538972,"An odd, yet yet ingenious idea. Cannibalism in the California mountains during the 1840s. Great performances by all especially Guy Pearce. Being a big fan of LA Confidential this one was a far different character. Cursed by his cowardness during the war with Mexico he's constantly having flashbacks early on to the brutal battles and how he survived(you'll like that one). Soon he decides he had better escape but runs into the American counterattack on the Mexican base. He takes advantage of the situation by capturing the Mexican commanders. Instead of haning him for cowardness he's given a medal and treated like a hero. But his company commander knows the truth and wants him as far away from him and his men as possible. He sends him to a fort in the California mountains run by a skeleton crew. Soon a stranger is found passed out outside their fort. But he isn't what he seems.

 Ravenous has a peculiar combination of black humor and one of the best musical scores for a movie I have ever seen. Don't get me wrong the music isn't the best for any movie but it just fits into the movie so well its amazing. An eerie western mix that was brilliantly put together. The black humor might push some away, but for me it made it much more fun to watch.

 Ravenous no doubt deserves to have better track record than it does. One of the most interesting tales I've yet to come across in a movie.

1046711,4,6305538972,"""Ravenous"" has the dubious honour of being a big studio film with a troubled history, which would normally earn it some kind of audience. Going through three directors (two jumped ship before star Carlyle suggested Brit Antonia Bird for the job), a troubled shoot and some decidedly dodgy marketing from 20th Century Fox (comical farce it is not and the trailer gives away one of the film's biggest plot twists!), it is amazing how ""Ravenous"" hasn't achieved its deserved cult status as yet. Which is a shame, as through the angry-looking gore and the queasily-black humour lies an absorbingly sharp film.
Director Bird, who collaborates with Carlyle and co-composer Damon Albarn quite often, and writer Ted Griffin plump for the satirical nature of the script, with cannibalism portrayed as a metaphor for consumerism, as well as throwing in a few political asides (""Ben Franklin once said: Eat to live, not live to eat,"" Carlyle's Colquhoun ponders at one point). Bird also chooses to not resort to cheesy heroics or 'hilarious' farce, but bravely plays up the seriousness of the destructive nature of the characters. She is aided in this task via wonderful performances from Guy Pearce as the reluctant hero, the under-rated Jeffrey Jones and the ever-wonderful Robert Carlyle.
True, gore is never everyone's cup of tea, so to speak, but those aching for something a little bit different/substantial as opposed to those prone to insatiable bloodlust will gain something from the ""Ravenous"" experience. Well worth a look.",994550400,6,1523,5.145161290322581

The wet-oak sensation drawn into your sensibilities by the superb music and the interestingly stoic faces of the movie's two lead character adds up to the smell of the film which makes this a nerve-wracking experience. Cannibalism is the central theme of the movie and the scenes are remorselessly shrewd and accurate. At the end of so many murders and gut-eating scenes, there is a tinge of irony in the last few scenes where a man is cooked up in a thorough way, and his abdomen and liver are eaten in a most amicable fashion.

For the first half of the film at least, we know that Captain John Boyd (Guy Pearce) has experienced a life-changing event during the bloody slaughter of battle, eating the flesh of the dead in order to survive the carnage that rages around him. His 'reward' for survival is banishment to a remote military camp, a staging post for settlers travelling west, following the promise of the brave new territories opening up in the California of the 1840's. Life in this run-down camp is routine and boring, until a bedraggled stranger arrives with a terrible tale to tell. Wild-eyed and half-crazed, Colqhoun (Robert Carlyle) explains he was part of a group of settlers that ended up in a nightmare of desperation, slaughter and cannibalism.  Everyone is aghast at his story and a search party is hastily gathered to hunt the culprits behind this inhuman act. But appetites have merely been wheted by this orgy of carnivorous murder and the unsuspecting soldiers cannot know that they are the main course. Only Boyd, who has tasted this meal before, has a sense of what terrors await.
Director Antonia Bird does eke out some genuinely horrifying moments out of the story, building tension out of the setting and character rather than cheap thrills, as she shrewdly taps into universal dreads and fears. The story also plays with the idea that cannibalism somehow provides strength beyond mere fat and protein, capturing the spirit and essence of the hapless victim, giving the eater almost superhuman power in process.
By setting the tale in the Old West,writer Ted Griffin - who scripted Best Laid Plans - gives his story a sense of distance and curiosity value. Elements of it seem like the kind of tale we have read about from history, while it also manages to avoid taking itself to seriously. Well acted by Guy Pearce, the ever-excellent Robert Carlyle and an impressive supporting cast, Ravenous manages to be dark, disturbing, stylized and over-the-top, all at once. It might not make vegeterians out of it's audience, but it will surely make them think befoe tucking into that post-cinema kebab.",973296000,,2242,4.962765957446808

With some funny points, some backgrounds, an excellent atmosphere, some nice costumes, a gothic aspect and an awesome soundtrack, the technical aspect of the film is perfect. The acting is great. The characters are a very important aspect in this film and that gives it some of its charm. We really get in the legend of Windigos, human-eating people who get stronger everytimethey eat human meat. This film is full of blood, it's very violent. And the ending is one of the best I've seen in my whole life (and I've seen almost the whole list of 100 best films of all times). I rented it five times, and I'll buy it soon.

Definitively this is a masterpiece on its genre, a must see... and a must have (if your are a fan of the genre).  One thing i liked most was the sensation of aloness and open space combined...

At any rate, and regardless of category, few would deny that this movie is different.  As such, its appeal, like all things avant-garde, is limited.

This movie is amazing. down to every last detail. The line is ""You are who you eat"".
The directing and acting was excellent. Robert Carlye (Full Monty &  Trainspotting and 007 WOrld not enough) and GUy Pierce (LA Confidential)  was in this one and they just went full out in this movie.
This was  about a army military post during the civil war, and they discover the  strengths of eating people.... or something like that...
It was freaky,  disgusting and pretty freaky.... entertaining . I think it's a guys flick  since I've never ever seen more blood in a movie!  The last scene was a  blast, my friend and I were like saying ""All they need left is a  butcher knife..."" and voila they used one. hahaha the last scene is  the longest and most bloodest scene I've ever seen!  Good stuff for fans  of gore.

1046789,5,6305538972,"I saw this film first time with a friend of mine. We rented in on a whim, not expecting to be blown away by this masterpiece of a cannibalism-film. Our hopes for the film were at first greatly diminished by the opening music, which made us think 'What on Earth is this, oh no, we've just wasted 4$, but refusing to give in so easily we sat through the next couple of minutes realizing that the music was rather okay once you got over the initial shock of the more or less eerie start.
The story has Guy Pearce (L.A. Confidential) as the main character who, against his will, is transferred to a small outpost in a cold region of California, beacuse a superior officer knows he's a coward and doesn't want him around, despite his brave act of taking over an enemy HQ. The time is middle 19th century and a war is taking place, which specific war it is escapes my memory right now, but Mexicans seem to be involved, as far as I remember. I don't want to give away too much, but this fabulous gem of a film will go on almost any shelf and stand proud, knowing that it is not just a great film, but also that it's DVD-features match the quality of the film. More DVD's with this much extra stuff on, please !!!!
Covering music I have to say that never in all of my years of film-viewing have I heard a soundtrack so mind-bogglingly strange which still manages to fit the film perfectly. When you've seen the film you'll know what I'm talking about. On this gem of a DVD you can, on one of the three (YEAH!) commentary tracks, hear Damon Albarn (Blur) and Michael Nyman talk about their work with the soundtrack. One specific incident in the movie, which involves the villain with a knife chasing a scared priest, has music so eerie, yet so funny, that I couldn't help screwing up my face totally, not knowing whether to laugh or be freaked out. So my face tried to manage a combination of both !
Also the acting is flawless, not one bad word should be uttered about anybody's acting in this film. The tall and stout Jeffrey Jones does a wonderful job of being a colonel who, despite his lost pride and dignity, still tries to be important in the small encampment, where most of the movie takes place. He can also be heard on one commentary track, giving insight into both himself as an actor, and into the movie itself. Robert Carlyle also does a terrific job of being a eerie'n'creepy guy, who, from the start, gives everyone the impression that he's a nice guy.
I fail to see how anyone might not like this film, but then again I may be in love with it, and so truly fail to see any little flaws it might have.
The DVD gives, as I already mentioned, superb value for money. Especially the 3 commentary tracks, the last one featuring Robert Carlyle talking (at times being silent for too long, though) mostly about his own character and himself. Jeffrey Jones does a better job on his commentary track, which he shares with another, lesser known, actor (not Guy Pearce) from the film.
If you've already seen 'Ravenous' and want more, do NOT hesitate to buy this DVD, as it, compared to the many boring DVD's there are, has many features, including deleted scenes, that, for some obscure reason, were cut from the film.
If you haven't seen this film before, go rent it at your local store to see if it's your cup of tea. My guess is that you won't be disappointed. If you, for some unknown reason, don't like it, write me and tell me, and I'll send you a 'I'm sorry I recommended it to you'-note.",967075200,4,3492,4.373846153846154

That's all okay,  because the rest of this film is delicious.  Oh wait, that came out wrong.  No, really, the movie was filmed very well, and the acting was incredibly  good, a sure highlight for Jeffery Jones, but This film, from almost every  angle, was brilliant.  From start to finish, it moves through  post-modernist film-styles to hokey slapstick, all the while manipulating  your reactions to it.  It's a two faced movie, the ultimate black comedy, a  contemporary macabre.  To illustrate it's manipulative nature and confusing  but extraordinary demeanor, we look to a scene of a psychotic cannibal  chasing down a scared-to-death preist in the woods, his chuckles audible  within the painful cries for help.  Our normal response is, well, not good,  as I would've viewed the scene as frieghtening enough, until...the music.  With a banjo/twang booming over this sadistic chase, we can see that the  film is most effetively humorous when the humor is post-production in  origin.  If it weren't for titles (a quote from 'anonymous':""Eat  me."") and for the music, this film could've been passed off as a  brooding drama.  Thank god it wasn't because I haven't laughed that hard at  Jim Carrey.  I thought to myself, perhaps the actors weren't even aware of  what was going to happen in post-production, because they keep straight  performances, strictly drama.  The acting is superb, as I mentioned, and  Guy Pearce continues his great work as seen in the previous film ""L.A.  Confidential"".  The same applies to Robert Carlyle, a wonderfully  psychotic slapstick actor and dramatic, see ""The Beach"".  All in  all, this film was strong to the points of script, good lines and  characters, music, photography, acting, directing, and of course, make-up  effects.  Don't be too afraid of this admittedly gory film.  I tricked my  squeamish parents into seeing it, and they loved it.  Bon appetite.",965865600,2,2024,5.085889570552148

1046870,5,6305538972,"Set against the backdrop of the snowy high Sierras of California,  ""Ravenous"" unfolds as a macabre adult fairy story, a parable of human  avarice and addiction. An army officer (Guy Pearce), decorated in  questionable circumstances, is banished to a remote outpost to become part  of  a shoddy ensemble of misfits including the drunk, the doped up weirdo  (David Arquette in a niche he has clearly made his own) and the bungling  bookworm who is the commanding officer. One stormy night, a stranger  (Robert Carlyle) intrudes on the quiet and recounts the terrible tale of  his ordeal amongst a snowbound party of travellers who, out of necessity,  turn to cannibalism. Things will never quite be the same for our motley  crew! Like all good fairy stories, ""Ravenous"" is at once scary and  irreverently amusing.....the horror is grotesque, but unreal. The casting  is first rate. Pearce and Carlyle make admirable opponents and Jeffrey  Jones adds to his portfolio of excellent character roles with a delightful  performance as the commanding officer. The cinematography is similarly  commendable, the stunning scenery being beautifully shot with an engrossing  attention to detail. The film combines elements of haunted house horror,  Western, black comedy and vampirism (a la  ""The Lost Boys"") in a unique and  thoroughly entertaining blend and this refreshing individuality  sets  ""Ravenous"" apart from the crowd.

If  you haven't seen it yet, and your a horror fan, you MUST see this. This is  a MUST see for all horror fans. The whole film is of classic quality and  was overlooked by the Academy Awards...as many horror movies are. The  performances by Guy Pierce, Robert Carlyle and the rest of the cast are  great!

But then things get much weirder!  Don't eat that stew!  This movie draws in religious references to  Christianity, American Manifest Destiny, and Native American folklore, to  create an intellectually and mythologically stimulating brew for the  culturally receptive mind.
The humor takes the edge off the horror, and  the horror takes the edge off of the humor, in a brilliant balance that  leaves this movie defying categorization.  It remains far too serious to be  called dark comedy, but it still has its fair share of humor.  Some of the  more intense moments in the movie gain an erie and otherworldly tone when  juxtaposed against some of the maniacally joyful music that accompanies  those moments.  The acting proves brilliant!  And the dynamics between  Robert Carlyle and Guy Pierce, hit a compelling range, from curious  interest, to hatred and disgust, and even reaching the depths of thinly  veiled homoerotic situational innuendo.  The rest of the acting was great,  but this amazing duo truly left the most memorable impression.
I think  the unfavorable reviews offered by some of the ""professional  critics"" more reflects their inability to handle this topic at all,  than any shortcomings of the movie itself.  If you think you may be a  little sensitive about the topic of cannibalism, you have been warned.  I  really don't think that any of the gruesomeness was gratuitous, and  certainly the movie could have been a LOT more gory than it was.  You  simply can't pretend to discuss cannibalism without gruesomeness.  To do  otherwise would have been a Pollyanna whitewash job.  If you have ever  thought about becoming vegetarian, especially for aesthetic and moral  reasons, this film just might push you over the edge!

1046874,4,6305538972,"I still have extremely conflicting emotions about this movie. This and STARSHIP TROOPERS are the two movies where I most had a hard time making up my mind. I certainly can't hate a new movie about the Mexican-American War  (forgotten by most, oddly, since we gained about a fourth or a fifth of our  total territory in the 1848 Treaty of Guadeloupe Hidalgo). The  cinematography was gorgeous, Slovakia making a more than adequate double  for 1840s California. The acting was intriguing, as far as it went. Guy  Pearce was convincing as a callow officer who wasn't sure how to handle the  difficult situation in which he found himself (it had to be one of the most  anti-heroic performances I've ever seen). Robert Carlyle was fantastic,  looking every inch the 19th century folk villain. Jeffrey Jones is probably  one of our most underrated actors; I remember in 1986 he played Thomas  Jefferson in the CBS ""George Washington"" miniseries AND Dean  Rooney in ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off."" This guy can do anything.  The movie really fell apart towards the end, I thought, but it was still a  worthwhile and jarring experience. If you still can't take it, than at  least buy the soundtrack, which was alone worth the price of admission.  Hopefully this will begin a groundswell of movies on the 1846-48 war (and  other little known features of 19th century American history), as Tom  Berenger's ONE MAN'S HERO (about the Mexican Army's San Patricio Regiment,  composed of Irish Catholic deserters from the U.S. Army) is scheduled to  come out soon (I believe).",957398400,,1557,4.896551724137931
1046875,4,6305538972,"The films I enjoy most are made by marginal directors having their way with a genre.  Ravenous is the perfect example.
Robert Carlyle is perfectly cast as a folkloric devil, not a big mighty Satan, but a little  obscene trickster. But that giggling little monster is just a part of him.  First time we see him he is helpless, blubbering and scared little thing. I  think that impersonation is very important for Ives. He is acting a loser,  the pathetic sight, the victim he might become if he did not make the  fateful decision. He has to convince himself it was worth it.
The music  accompanying the chase makes us think about the evil forest creatures of  frontier yarns and tall-tales that deal with death rather  matter-of-factedly. The predator is enjoying himself, smirking and  squinting - the jaunty eccentric. The second face of the demon.
But in  the second half of the movie he looks resigned. Ives feels that he still  needs a justification. He has found The Way, he is The Predator and the  rest are The Victims. But something is gnawing at him.
- It's a lonely  life. - as Jeffry Jones's character says. Ives needs the disciples - what  is a messiah without apostles!  A self-deluded maniac?
Boyd seems to be a  perfect choice. The taste is not unfamiliar to him. He also needs a cure  from his feebleness, his fear, his guilt.
Ives is not in a hurry to kill  him. The cannibal  approaches Boyd with his logic, he tempts him with the  strangely exhilarating memories, confronts with a life-or-death  choice.
The little devil fails. First colonel decides to quit. Then Boyd  prefers to suffer and die rather than join the club.
The final battle was  inevitable - it's XX Century Fox after  all! The film must end with  something climactic to sell more tickets, tapes and DVDs. It's funny to  watch mortal combat of two guys who  are not sure of their current status -  are they alive, dead or half-dead?
Guy Pearce's role echoes his  L.A.Confidential big-screen debut. The award ceremony is practically the  same - Guy in uniform recieves the honors for the courage he does not feel.  He is still that reluctant hero with blood-smeared face. In both films he  gets an offer to cross to the dark side and kills the corruptor.
I am not  going to comment on how good soundtrack is, Jeffry Jones superb acting or  Arquette guy's brief apperance which does not merit putting his name on  posters and DVD covers. It's all evident.
Also I don't think there is any  sense in naming the film a Horror, Black Comedy or Historical Thriller -  marketing that movie is not our task.

It was funny, scary, unexpected, well scripted, extrememly well acted and of course gory as  hell.  But it wasn't done in the usual splatter and blood shed most  accompanied  done in such good taste.  (no pun intended)  Robert Carlyle  and his beaty eyes, as Colonel Ives was as creepy as he was cool.  As well  as Boyd played by Guy Pierce wonderfully done.  He started off so weak, and  showed how his strength slowly improved after eating the flesh of the men  he was trying to save.  Jeffery Jones, David Arquette and  Neil McDouough  were also excellent as was the rest of the cast. It was dark and amusing.  I thought for sure that the film was going to make me ill and had lots of  reservations about seening it.  I am so glad I did, 4 times.  The final 10  minutes were excruciating for me.  I didn't dare watch but couldn't close  my eyes.  And the final words that Boyd and Ives share are so great.  It  was so snide and witty I chuckled.  I bought it as soon as it was available  out at the store.  The music is another asset to the film.  The question  is, what the heck is it?  It is almost playful and fun.  I have no idea if  Antonia Byrd got her point across the way that she was trying, but as far  as I'm concerend it was yummy and something you can sink your teeth into.",955152000,,1411,4.130597014925373

I've never seen a movie that blends  horror, history, mythology and humor in this fashion. The scenery (the  movie was filmed in Poland and Slovakia) and the music are breathtakingly  beautiful. The characters are interestingly developed (I've never seen  Jeffrey Jones play a role like this) and the story moves you right along.  You don't have to understand the concept of cannibalism, or be sympathetic  to it, to enjoy this film.

The cast is superb (especially  Robert Carlisle) and the whole story line plays out like an excerpt from  one of the old E.C. comics.  Yeh, it's over the top.  Sure, it's excessive  in the depiction of gore.  But come on, enjoy it!  After all, it's just a  movie.  I mean no one ever really resorted to cannibalism out on America's  western frontier.

The soldiers hike into the forest to find the other two  survivors, but the plot thickens.

Luckily,  there was something that made me want to see ""Ravenous"". So when  I finally did watch ""Ravenous"" I was VERY pleased. Sure, there's  lots of blood and gore, but there are also serious dynamics that some might  even relate to the sexual politics of meat (Refer to the book by Carol  J.Adams). The music is beautiful (mostly by Damon from Blur), but sometimes  did not seem to go along with particular scenes. The acting is superb.  Those who are like me, will be happy to know that there is no White Zombie  or much David Arquette in the film. The ending is symbolically beautiful.  Not for everyone, but totally enthralling.

1046915,5,6305538972,"I saw RAVENOUS about a month ago, and I'm still thinking about it.  Director Antonia Bird came out of the woods and thwacked me over the head with this one.  For the first few sequences, she leads you to believe this  is a DANCES-WITH-WOLVES type of movie (almost matching that film scene for  scene, in fact), but after about five minutes she starts taking you on one  sudden, surprising departure after another, and you realize that this is no  DANCES WITH WOLVES, and that you are, on the contrary, in for a very weird,  very fun, and very clever roller coaster ride.  It's a credible, effective,  and original horror movie, but for all its bloodiness, it's also a very  intelligent and pointed morality tale; a fable pointed at our man-eat-man  times.  Robert Carlyle relishes his role, Jeffrey Jones dishes up his usual  understated excellence, and Guy Pearce pulls off a surprising change of  palate from LA CONFIDENTIAL.",948240000,,927,4.821656050955414
1046916,5,6305538972,"Beautiful scenery, top-notch directing, Robert Carlyle, Guy Pearce, Jeffrey Jones, cannibalism - what's not to like?
RAVENOUS takes place in the winter of 1847.  Guy Pearce plays Boyd, who due to the disgust of his  commanding officer (Boyd capture an enemy commander, but only by playing  dead), is send to a remote outpost in the Sierra Nevadas, run by Colonel  Hart (Jones).  One night, a half-dead man (Carlyle) arrives telling a story  of cannibalism.  And then the fun starts.
I am a film and video major,  and from what I have been taught so far, RAVENOUS shows some of the best  directing in years.  The pace of the scenes and the brilliant performances  (even by the overrated David Arquette) throw you deep into the story.
If  you were disturbed by the amounts of gore in Braveheart, Dracula, or any  run-of-the-mill slasher flick, then RAVENOUS is probably not for you.  I  like gory movies, so I didn't have a problem with it.
But RAVENOUS is  far more than just a gory movie, it has all the elements of an artsy flick  as well.  The pyschological conflict between the two leads, the symbolism.  The breathtaking scenery (shot in Slovakia) adds so much to an already  great film.  The music is at times haunting, other times funny, and always  seems to belong.  Costumes are great too.
Although labeled as a Dark  Comedy, RAVENOUS is more than that.  In fact, it doesn't fit well into any  real genre, and I think that is the reason why it works so well.  Comedy  fans make not like it.  Horror fans may not either.  But any serious film  lover (with an affinity for gore) will love RAVENOUS.
So, do yourself a  favor and rent Ravenous (I wouldn't buy a movie until after I had seen it).  You might be pleasantly surprised.",947894400,6,1735,4.6019736842105265
1046917,5,6305538972,"Ravenous is one of the best movies I've ever seen in my entire life. I loved the way it was set and the cast was excellent. This movie is not for everyone though, just for those who have a strong stomach or like  cannibalism type films. Antonia Bird is fantastic as well. She and the rest  of the cast and crew knew what they were doing whern they made it. The  first time I saw it in theaters I was totally amazed with it, I just  couldn't wait til it came out on video. I even bought the soundtrack not  too long after the film was released. The music to it is grand, it has a  since of irony to it. When I told people about Ravenous, they just didn't  seem like it was the kind of flick for them, I guess I'm really the only  one at my school who is totally crazed about it. I enjoy sitting on the bus  when I go to meets or other things and listening to the Ravenous soundtrack  while every one else is listening to other music. I love it! I would also  like to say that it will be the best movie that has a good since of irony  and maybe the best film during its setting in the 1840's. This film has not  been recognized much by critics and should be. Ted Griffin also deserves to  be rewarded for his great knowledge in writing the script.

1046918,5,6305538972,"What really makes this movie special is its originality - there are so few movies (horror ones especially) that take place in the early days of American colonial history. It's a bit surprising, as it's a setting that's  full of wild and mysterious opportunities for storytelling.
But there's  more than just the unique setting. We have the concept of cannibalism  paired with a bit of soul vampirism, an Indian legend that appears to be  true, breathtaking scenery (shot in middle Europe, I believe) and some  extremely tense scenes. The acting is way above average, at least for  Robert Carlyle and Jeffrey Jones. Carlyle is especially haunting as the  catalyst of the story, going from near-death to a ragged bundle of nervous  energy to a calm and collected and impeccably attired officer.
The DVD is  very well stuffed with extras - several commentaries, deleted scenes with  commentary, trailers, a nice section on set and costume design, and an  excellent transfer that helps us see that beautiful scenery I  mentioned.
This is not the sort of movie you'd purchase without seeing  first, though - so I'd recommend a rental. You may find it's not to your  liking, or you may end up like I did - buying your own copy.",947116800,12,1221,4.8076923076923075

It's just that most people don't know  what a good movie is when they see one. The many reasons I absolutely love  ""Ravenous"" is because of the excellent music score composed and  performed by Michael Nyman and Damon Albarn, in fact, I happen to own the  soundtrack. The film is very well-cast with great performances from start  to finish. Guy Pearce was superb in his portrayle of Civil War hero Captain  John Boyd. I especially love the performances of Robert Carlyle as the  show-stealing, cannibalistic Scotsman and Jeffrey Jones (known for  ""Beetlejuice"" fame) as a wallnut-eating colonel. The  cinematography of Anthony B. Richmond is so striking, giving a great  atmosphere for each and every scene. ""Ravenous"" is an instant  cult classic and one of the best horror films made in years.

Antonia Bird, who directed Ravenous, has me totall y convinced of her boundless directorial talent!  With this Cinematic Masterpiece, she has distanced herself from the  hackneyed pack, having crafted a grippingly intense and bizarrely original  film, that absolutely defies any attempt at pigeonholing or labeling it! A  Dark Comedy?  At times amusing, often deftly ironic, chillingly  irreverent, seemingly almost intentionally politically INcorrect, and  perhaps, ever so subtly feminist at the core...but certainly, ANYTHING BUT  FUNNY!
Juxtapositioning, with flawless style and sobering  effectiveness, diverse elements of Horror, Period  Western,Action-Adventure,Psychodrama,Suspense and the Supernatural, against  a backdrop of some of the most breathtakingly dazzling outdoor scenery  imaginable,(Shot near Durango, Mexico)set to a perversely inspired musical  score that sould be utilized in Cinema production classes to highlight the  full potential of music to shape the ambience of a film and provide the  psychological equivalent of running your fingernails across a blackboard  during many scenes! Ms. Bird undoubtedly has a way with people! Other-  wise, how would she have managed to have coaxed such an array of truly  riveting performances from each and every member of a uniquely superb cast!  Guy Pearce(L.A.Confidential), starring as Captain Boyd, provided us with an  uncannily haunting por- trait of a tormented pacifistic soldier, in the  throws of a fierce struggle for his own soul! Robert Carlyle(Full  Monty/Trainspotting)was icily convincing as a fanatically focused, but  utterly deranged cannibal in uniform! Jeffrey Jones, in a oddly empathetic  change of pace role, played mild -mannered Colonel Hart,plagued by an  interminable list of human frailities, thusly,he is easily subverted by the  sinister Ives.(Carlyle) Despite all of the aforementioned accolades,I feel  I must offer a word of caution......Ravenous is undoubtedly NOT a film  suited to everyone's taste! Many have complained that it revels in scenes  of graphic gore...I, for one, totally disagree with these  observations. Compared to Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers,(Which I  consider to be an utter abomination!)Ravenous has scarcely a few mo- ments  of starkly violent or macabre footage! The difference is, seemingly, that  in Ravenous these moments seem so devastatingly repulsive, that they don't  go away easily. Perhaps this is the reaction Stone wanted to achieve in  Killers..but failed miserably in doing so!
Consequently, I would  hesitate to throw out the Welcome Mat on this one!  Perhaps, if films like  2001: A Space Odyssey; The Shawshank Redemption; & The English Patient  are among your favorites, Ravenous just might turn out to be one of the  most valued films in your collection!  However, if WATERBOY and ARMAGEDDON  (Although en- tertaining in their own predictable way!) are at the TOP of  your list....My money would be 10 to 1 against you on this one !  I'd  recommend you steer clear of it !  The DVD version was chockful of  tantilizing extras ...such as various commentary tracks, but oddly, offered  no details of Cast & Crew...a very reprehe nsible oversight! By the  way, should anyone out there just happen to know Antonia Bird personally,  it would please me to no end if she were to read this review!",944438400,2,3419,5.660079051383399
1046934,4,6305538972,"I rented this flick for Guy Pierce, whom I thought was excellent in L.A. Confidential.  Earlier I had read some predominately bad reviews by the big name critics about Ravenous.  But I never base my opinions on what they  say, that it would be very narrow minded of me.  And being the film lover  that I am, the thought of passing up such a contraversial movie on mere  heresay seemed, well, stupid.  So what did I think?  Ravenous was  technically very well made, well scripted and well acted.  The story was  excellent, quite fresh and new.  I was disappointed only in the director's  complete misuse of camp.  The art of eating human flesh is, I'm quite sure,  probably grotesque in nature.  Perhaps that is what made the film is so  difficult to watch at times.  I'm not criticising that aspect, it's  everything else that distracted me.  Such as the scene in which Guy Pierce  kills Jeffery Jones' character.  The gore content peaked and really and  truly there was no need of it.  Horror classics such as the original Night  of the Living Dead which involved extreme canniblism in no way lowered  itself to campy effects.  So what am I saying?  See, rent or buy the movie  for its thrilling story.  Try to overlook everything else.",943833600,,1237,4.618604651162791

Robert Carlyle gave me chills with his  brilliant performance. Everytime he was on screen, a chill ran up my spine.  Pearce was excellent also. He showed skill and determination in resisting  the act of cannibalism and his acting was not forced... very believeable.  The only disapointing thing was, is that they really didn't delve too much  into the reason why cannibalism was started except to mention an indian  fable.

1046937,5,6305538972,This is an amazing film.

One thing that makes this a good film instead a truly  excellent one is the poor luck of the filmmakers. This was supposed to be  much like ""The Thing"". The plot being that a few people got stuck  in the mountains during a snow storm and couldn't find food. The problem  is, it was filmed during El Nino, and the snow didn't come until the last  few days of shooting. So the whole time you're wondering why these people  got stuck, and why they can't find any food, since it's a green, albeit  muddy forest. The performances overshadow this plot iconsistancy however  and create a creepy web of paranoia which threatens to be their undoing.  The extras are cool, with a commentary track including Jeffrey Jones and  the director, a commentary track by Robert Carlysle (I don't recommend this  one, it doesn't even start until 20 minutes into the movie), deleted  scenes, and even an easter egg.
