The tunes had great messages and the audience had a great time. Great show - great video. i'm gonna buy a dozen copies for presents",1296345600,,248,4.533333333333333
8003417,5,B0000V48YS,"My two year old son and four year old daughter absolutely love The Animal Band.  They have this DVD and three CDs and they love them all.  They dance to the music (much better than being a couch potato), and I enjoy listening to it, too.  The best thing about this DVD is that both of my children like it, so there is no fussing about what to watch.  If they are disagreeing, I suggest The Animal Band and they always get excited.",1134518400,,430,4.144578313253012
8003418,5,B0000V48YS,"My two sons, 6 & 3.5, LOVE this DVD. They watch it and sing along. They dance and sing the tunes all day after watching it.  I highly recommend this DVD for people with multiple children up to age 7.",1102982400,,199,3.975
8003419,5,B0000V48YS,"I first listened to the ""Animal Band"" on CD.

  I have a 3 year old grandson who sat and watched the video with me for the first time tonight.

  Listening to the CD he would sing along with the characters but when he saw the VHS he became scared of the animals.  Especially when the audience participated in a song and one dress up like a gorilla.

  Listening to the CD was great but when he put a face to the music he became frightened.

  The VHS is great but be careful. The first time your child watches it, I recommend that you watch it with them.  Some of the animals can be scary to a younger child.  If your child is easily frightened just listen to the CD; you will get the same enjoyment.  If your child is comfortible with zoo like animals then the VHS or DVD is the better route.

  The VHS or DVD is great and I give it 5 stars because it is parent approved.",1096588800,4,873,4.029411764705882
8003420,5,B0000V48YS,"If you watch a Wiggles or Barney tape, you have to enjoy it through the eyes of your kids. When you watch The Animal Band, you can not only enjoy it through your kids, but you can enjoy it directly yourself. The band is hot. The singer is hot. The guitarist is hot. The music is hot! And... while you enjoy the sounds, your  kids can enjoy the sounds AND learn at the same time.
My kids (1.5 and 3.5 yrs old) LOVE this video. No other video gets them dancing in the living room the way this one does. Not sure if it's the music or the animal costumes that rev them up, but they get revved up every time they watch it.
The songs are all solidly entertaining and wonderfully lyricked (is that a word?). From ""The Imagination Dance"" to ""Call 911"" (what to do in an emergency), there is nothing about this video you won't like. I love, mostly, that it's real musicians performing live. It gives kids a concert to watch, with kids and adults in the audience having fun!. The only thing that could be better would be to have The Animal Band play live near our home. It'd be a blast.",1078704000,11,1076,4.1980676328502415
