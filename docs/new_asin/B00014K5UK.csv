1970615,5,B00014K5UK,"The Bernie mac show is hilarious and extremly funny. The show is very original and i found it was different from most shows on tv. I really like how Bernie reaches out and talks to the viewers to let us know what he's thinking. Also the use of words and arrows throughout the show seemed to add more of a sense of humor as well as originality. Overall the show provides top notch laughs and can be enjoyed by everyone of ALL ages. I think Bernie and the producers did an excellent job with the whole show and i can't wait until season 2 is released on DVD. I HIGHLY recommend this DVD and suggest that you pick it up, Well worth it!",1087257600,9,632,4.146341463414634

1970672,5,B00014K5UK,"I love these episodes.  I watched them all twice.  All the actors are great in their roles.  In the show, Bernie Mac and his wife, an upper middle class couple, are taking care of 3 of his sisters kids. The teenage girl is a typical teenager who doesn't like Bernie always interfering in her life. The middle boy is the funniest. He is very sneaky and fun. The cute little girl has a sneaky side too. In each episode, there is usually a conflict, oftentimes caused by Bernie's loving but overprotective and old fashioned parenting style. Of course, they always make up at the end.",1395187200,,580,4.504761904761905

1970694,5,B00014K5UK,"This is an awesome show! We need more shows like this on T.V.! This is our second set that we have purchased. We love this show and so do our children. This is real T.V. To much junk on T.V. now days. In fact we cut the cord on our cable bill and we no longer have cable. We watch this show through Netflix on our Roku  and our season one collection. We can't wait to see season two!

This show is so awesome, you will laugh, roll on the floor laughing, cry laughing.. Whew this is a funny entertaining show! So we like to take our DVD collection in our car so that our children can have something funny to watch, that is clean entertainment!.

You will love season one, and will be ready for season two to come out. Not sure what is taking so long, must be music rights etc... but we will be glad when it is released. As there is really nothing on T.V to watch, which is the reason we decided to stop wasting our money on cable. The Bernie Mac show is a show that we already had before we cut cable and we watch the show on a regular along with other great shows like soul food t.v. series, the wire, the boondocks, planet of the apes, etc.. This way we have T.V. the way we want it, and the shows that we like and we can watch the shows over and over, stop where we want to and pick up where we want to..

So if still have not decided on this T.V. series, you will be very disappointed if you pass this up. The quality of our first set was great. The art work and disc covers were in almost new condition. We purchased our first set used have just purchased our second set used(will come back and update this review to let you know how the second set looks). First set cost us $8.00 used and the second set cost us about $7 dollars and some change. So this will be a great addition to your movie collection.

Good luck with your decision... each episode is full of great entertainment!",1335571200,,1887,4.0754716981132075

Bernie Mac is the perfect blend of Bill Cosby, George Jefferson, and Fred Sanford, all rolled into one!  Each episode shows a loving ""father figure"" who, despite being a little rough around the edges at times, always manages to show his family how much he loves and cares for them.  Every single episode is laugh-out-loud funny!  The chemistry between the cast is amazing, and everything about this show makes you think you are watching a real family in action.  It is truly one of the best DVD collections I've ever purchased.  I honestly can't think of another TV show that had as strong of a first season as The Bernie Mac Show.

Just the night before his untimely death, I was watching ""The Bernie Mac Show"" and thinking how remarkable it is that it doesn't matter how many times I've seen an episode I watch it as if I have never seen it before.  That puts ""The Bernie Mac Show"" in the same company as ""I Love Lucy"", ""Father Knows Best"", ""Leave It To Beaver"", ""The Andy Griffin Show"", ""Seinfeld"" and only a very few other sitcoms.....which is an extraordinary accomplishment for any actor, but, especially for a comedian - and even more significant for an African American comic -turned-actor.  All of the shows are well-written, heart-warming and brilliantly delivered.  You can feel Uncle Bernie's love for his family and the episodes make you wish you could've been a part of his household.  He was simply the best.  May he rest in peace and his legacy grow stronger, enhancing the recognition and appreciation he so rightly deserved.",1223078400,5,1085,5.545454545454546

1970724,4,B00014K5UK,"Bernie Mac's untimely death came all too soon at the young age of 50. A comedic icon who rose from the poorest of upbringings, Mac blossomed as an actor and comedian. From the stage to television, Bernie Mac first caught national attention while performing on Def Comedy Jam in the early nineties. He later went on to appear in several films such as  Kings of Comedy, Bad Santa, Transformers, Get On The Bus, and others.

He was probably best known for his comedy series titled ""The Bernie Mac Show"" which aired for five years on Fox Television. An instant hit with television audiences, the show was based on many of his own experiences as a child growing up in Chicago. The series displays his multiple talents as actor, comedian, writer, and overall performer and unfolds through his eyes as Bernie's character becomes  and evolves into fatherhood.

The crossover appeal of the Bernie Mac show further cemented his legacy in the hearts and minds of a new generation. Bernie Mac will be missed as a wondrous talent and his willingness to make us laugh will never be forgotten. Rest in peace Bernie, we will forever miss you.

1970725,5,B00014K5UK,"RIP to Bernie Mack He truly adapted to tv though he wasn't always happy with the politics of tv, he made it work and this show was funny despite not having a live audience or a laugh track. He touched on alot of themes and topics on season 1 and the show truly left a mark. i dig the first few seasons but season one was on point.",1218326400,,330,3.8676470588235294
1970726,5,B00014K5UK,"I just heard the news that Bernie Mac died.  What horrible news.  He's one of the funniest comedians of the last 10 years.  I used to watch his show the Bernie Mac Show on Fox.  I loved it.  His style of comedy in that show was hilarious.  The way he'd boss his kids around (or rather, his sisters kids) all while having a positive message about how important it is to respect your parents, and how important it is to find important ways for kids to get involved in different activities, and bringing out the best in a family.

There was a very realistic and honest feel to the entire show, that many of us can relate to, and Bernie Mac's character fit right in.  I'm glad the show was a success.

I remember tuning it to the very first episode, and enjoying it right away.  I knew it was going to be a success, unlike many other Fox shows that seem to get cancelled after 10 episodes or so.  The Bernie Mac Show went on to have a very successful amount of seasons and episodes, something everyone involved with the show should be proud of.

Remember the great Bernie Mac by watching his Bernie Mac Show, and experience a comedy that was well worth the time and effort.

One of the his most memorable lines in one of his episodes came when he said the difference between new music and old is that, in the older days, you can listen to an album from beginning to end and be completely satisfied with it.  As a music fan, and especially a fan of 70's music, I have to agree with him there.  Thank you for the fantastic, creative, and extremely funny show, Bernie.",1218240000,3,1561,4.279863481228669
1970727,5,B00014K5UK,"Bernie Mac passed away this morning.  Unbelievable!  In a time when we are in dire need of comedic stress relief, Bernie was, and will always be, one of the go-to guys and gals.  His BERNIE MAC SHOW was a pleasant surprise in a TV culture polluted by cheap-sex and trash-your-parents  s*it coms.  Don't get me wrong;I like cutting edge humor, i.e. Bill Hicks, etc, but when the BMS first came on the air, I knew Bernie and the show were going to be different.  It really was something that was sorely needed on television.  Goodbye Bernie!  Your sense of humor, your comedy, your talent, and your lack of Hollywood ego will always be remembered!

His humor is so keen and enjoyable and you don't have to be embarrassed. I just wish we could see more of his talent. He's amazing, and he lets others around him, shine as well. Big Admirer of Bernie Mac!! And, read his bio. He  IS  Bernie Mac!!  Kudos to the King!!!!

1970734,5,B00014K5UK,"From the moment I saw the first episode of the Bernie Mac Show I was hooked. Working with foster children, I feel this show addresses many of the problems foster parents and the children go through. Bernie Mac adds some humor to the situation but he does't leave out the feelings and adjustments everybody has to deal with. At first I was looking at the show for the entertainment, but, when the episode of Jordan and the telescope  was over, I had chills up and down my spine. Then I had to watch all the episodes over again. My children, who are now adopted by me, love to watch these shows from time to time.

We are waiting for Season 2 to be released. Bernie Mac - 5 Stars

and if I could give you more I would. However, I will say this, if there is a mantle that Bill Cosby left when his show ended, you have earned it.",1145836800,4,825,4.14375
1970735,5,B00014K5UK,"Season one of the Bernie Mac Show is a must own for anyone who likes family-oriented TV shows (with a little edge.) While the situation the family finds itself in is a modern all-too-familiar trend in child-rearing, Bernie Mac and the producers and writers of this show handle it with such care while making it one of the most heart-felt shows on TV. The casting of this show is great as well. And the best part -- the kids are the central force (and catalyst) of the storylines. This is good family viewing. I quite honestly am amazed that FOX has stayed with the show given its habit of taking off great shows that have only mediocre ratings. Thank heaven this show keeps making the cut.

However I do have one issue with FOX...where the heck are the rest of the seasons?",1135036800,24,773,4.443661971830986
1970736,5,B00014K5UK,"Perhaps one of FOX's most underrated shows (next to Arrested Development), The Bernie Mac Show is a gem of a comedy series that panders to no one. Using parenting as a background (which comes off more sucessful here than on ABC's My Wife and Kids, but is still a well written comedy), the show goes off in wonderful tangents that make you laugh. The pilot episode started it off with the line ""I'm going to beat them in the heads until the white stuff shows."" Not a line Ward Cleaver or Bill Cosby would've said, but is none the less a brilliant, and uncomfortable truth for many parents. The kids are three dimensional and don't spout sitcom cliches. Camille Winbush's Vanessa is every teenage girl who suddenly finds her world rocked, and hates every minute she spends with her Uncle, while the talented Jeremy Suarez is a perfect foil for Bernie. Even Dee Dee Davis, playing the youngest sibling, Bryana has more dimensions than most of the cast of Three and Half Men. The show is cleverly written and its great to see a ""parent"" on a TV show not know all the answers (which is, of course, the reason why Kellita Smith as Bernie's wife Wanda is there. She knows those kids, and knows their problems and knows, eventually, that Bernie will learn his lessons).

Like AD, Bernie Mac is shows what happens when creative freedom is given to a show. FOX may think in demographics, but Bernie Mac is one of those rare shows that crosses over to everyone. And that, I think, confuses them.

can't wait for season two on DVD.",1124755200,33,1519,4.54014598540146

1970740,5,B00014K5UK,"I just discovered this show a few months ago via summer reruns and couldn't believe how good it is. I was familiar with Bernie Mac's work and a huge fan, but somehow my family with young children could never stay up quite late enough to watch the show. When we finally did - my daughter is now Brianna's age and my son Jordon's (and has some very scary similaries) we feel in love at first sight. The sitcom is structured so that Bernie always has to learn a lesson - but the structure of the sitcom isn't like any other on tv - and there isn't any meanness in it like there are in so many others. In short, although it is edgy, and very funny, it is also touching and sweet and very very real. Bernie reminds me of the students I used to teach back in Chicago - so many of his idoms and figures of speech are just so back home. Just very very very great. An absolute work of art.
