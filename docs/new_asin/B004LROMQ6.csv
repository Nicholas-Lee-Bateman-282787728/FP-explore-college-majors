4403592,2,B004LROMQ6,I had to watch this movie for a college class. I would never have watched it on my own. This was a scary and sad movie,1356480000,,118,3.576923076923077
4403593,5,B004LROMQ6,"I have a friend who loves these Lifetime movies. When released, this was the crown jewel of all the lifetime movies and one of the first ones that I remember there was actually some buzz about. I was proud to give it to my addicted friend.",1355097600,,239,4.217391304347826
4403594,1,B004LROMQ6,"I really tried to watch this movie, but I found myself grinding my teeth at the mishaps through out the production. Now, I can see that there are so many people who liked this one, but when you view the ""48 Hours"" Documentary about it, I think that you may understand why.

 I am not rating this low because I want to get on anyone's nerves. I am truly giving this a low rating because I KNOW that they could have left this for a production who had the patience and the right casting and a director who has a docu-drama vision (with the alignment of sharpness as the ""Fatal Vision"" movie).

 I'm  truly sorry folks, I cannot honestly say that even for those who liked it that it is worth 9.95. Wait until the price drops or record this one through your Comcast/ Xfinity line up. There are movies that are truly worth the money that you spend and then there are others (like this one) that made me gag. To those who really loved it, it does not reflect on your taste. I personally , really, disliked it. I wanted to like it. I really did. I was look forward all day into the night to watch this one. I thought, now they can't possibly chew this one up as well, they just can't. But they did....

Lifetime has been making movies that just lack the suspense of the films that they formerly aired when Lifetime was hot in the mid to early 1990s to 2004. Lifetime aired True Story films that were produced from other networks and that is what drew so many viewers in to this channel orignally. Men were actually watching this channel in the early Millinium and it just has lost its appeal across the board. The men do not even like this present day ""Lifetime"" any more. I have collections of recordings when Lifetime even aired the Robert Stack ""Unsolved Mysteries"" and it was a great channel. It was the only station that I could count on for the very best. But something happened...the quality just...I don't know, is so shoddy and too whiny, everyone sounds like a duck, I mean, who speaks like this and so loud. No natural talent in the casting anymore. Just disappointing.

There are very few Lifetime movies worth catching like the Drew Peterson case (Untouchable) and I truly heard that Rob Lowe was pretty close to chilling. This version of this true story about ""Seven Days of Rage: The Craigslist Killer"" was just so weak that anyone would be better off purchasing this one at a price close to 1.25 or so because Lifetime really needs to take the time to build up true suspense and learn from the former masters why Lifetime was truly the place to be over 15 years ago. Not all the Lifetime movies are bad, but they are not very good as of the past 5 years and plus.

They haven't even aired ""Dead By Sunset"" and all the other oldies but goodies in such a very long time. Lifetime use to be a very edgy channel that dared to show very scary movies based on True-Stories and now they have sanitized them to the point to remove the entire point of what makes a true story suspenseful. It is as if they have mixed in too much Disney/Pixar meets Hallmark with a touch of Nick at Nite...it's too insincere and lacks the meat that Lifetime used to serve up. I would like to see Lifetime use better directors, take some chances, use some better actors, and producers and seasoned actors for their future projects so that this new generation of folks will really know what a ""sink your teeth"" into a well told  drama/thriller truly is. If you are going to pay for anything and if they are going to flood cable with 20 commercials every 5 minutes , then, they can afford to churn out a better product than this. It isn't fair and I truly am not the only one.

By the way, catch, ""Seven Days of Rage: The Craigslist Killer"" and a few of the other true stories which ended up under this new ""Lifetime"" team. When you go to ""You Tube"", you will be able to watch a grittier version of what they tried to do here and the entire version is uploaded to watch the ""48 Hours"" version of this case. I just watched it again tonight and the news magazine has so much more substance than whatever they were trying to do here. Even the scoring (music build-up) fell flat.

Music tension is very key to a story with this level of intensity and Lifetime did an injustice to this story. It should not always focus on the women all of the time, there should be a balance of genders contributing to the story. It was the same thing that they did to the recent movie aired a week or two ago about the Col. in Canada who stole women's underwear and murdered his own solider who worked under him and GARY COLE played the role and it was so disappointing. Gary Cole is our favorite. He is the best for true stories, but was miscast, just as they miscasted the actors in THIS movie.

 And please folks, this is not a personal put down towards anyone who liked it. In fact, when I played this movie at my home, I invited others for big screen ""Movie Night"" and I just was not the only one who reacted this way about this version of the ""Craigslist Killer"". It felt as if they were cheating the audience out of the true effect of what actually happened in this case.

It was not even close to the actual story (or that they even tried to cast the most accurate characters) and they could have tried with a bit more effort. And yes, I really could have directed a better version (as this is my calling)  that would not have cheated the audience into releasing something before the competition.

 Just save your money for a richer and better true story movie. This will come on again and again because it is fairly new. This movie is not going off the shelves anytime soon and your money is better spent developing your collection on movies that are rare or hard to find before those movies are completely ""out"" of America.

I couldn't even find  ""Murder Between Friends"" in THIS country any more and I had to go to another specialized site to order that movie at a better price and on DVD. Focus on the Patty Duke collections and the movies that were made from other networks before purchasing this one or just wait for a used copy in solid condition. Just do not pay full price for this one because I KNOW that they could have devoted more effort into this film. I sincerely do.",1343779200,3,6248,4.338474721508141
4403595,5,B004LROMQ6,"I first saw this on Lifetime and it was really bizarre.  I have never answered any personals ads on Craigslist (simply for the possibility of what the movie showed), I have looked at them and still cannot believe people actually try to find affection that way.  After seeing The Craigslist Killer, it solidifies my thoughts.  Everyone who uses this means to try and get some attention from another person should see this film.  It might make people think twice.",1330387200,,461,4.7974683544303796
4403596,5,B004LROMQ6,I REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE ALOT. I AM INTO HISTORICAL AND MILITARY MOVIES. I FIND THEY ARE FASCINATING TO ME.,1325808000,,110,4.55
4403597,4,B004LROMQ6,"amazon does not give us half stars.  i would grade this 3.5 if it did.  this is because it never aimed to be anything but a tv movie of the week and it does a very competent job of that.  however, if you were to compare it against a feature film of similar subject matter, like the five star WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN, there is no comparison.

this film does not depart from the known story in any way.  although i was interested in the dual life of the killer as talented medical student by day and criminal by night, the even better story is his fiance who has an almost impossible time realizing her entire dream has gone up in smoke.  her family has a heck of a problem on its hands with her level of denial too. a big part of this is that her fiance SEEMED the ideal for any American young woman.  he was hard working, studious, becoming a doctor with a brilliant future ahead of him, not bad looking, and so forth and so on. she had her whole life mapped out with her wedding planned and already posted online.  HER story could become a fantastic feature film because this is a story played out daily all over America as young women deny other aspects of their future intended spouses because they otherwise fit the dream wedding concept.  so i would like to see a remake of this as a feature film but entirely from her and her family's point of view.

4403598,3,B004LROMQ6,"This is the true story of a killer who fools just about everyone by leading a double life as  medical student and also as a killer who used Craigslist's now defunct erotic services section to find women to rob or kill.
No real standout performances or direction here; it is mostly by the numbers but still a fascinating look at the dangers of meeting people online.",1320278400,,365,4.53030303030303
4403599,4,B004LROMQ6,"I saw this movie when it first came on Lifetime. I think they did enough of a good job in mimicing this killer, a killer who at first got a thrill at robbing these women at gun point which later escalated to killing. His girlfriend though I feel for her because there will be some scares to bear with being in love with someone who you never knew could be a monster. The victims my hearts still goes out to the family. Who knew people could turn craigslist.com into a killing play ground and it's still going on. Upon saying that even though what happen was a tragedy i personally think they did a good job with this movie.",1297555200,2,623,4.243697478991597

4403636,4,B004LROMQ6,"A compelling movie outlining the events of the Craiglist Killer. Although I do not fully understand what went terribly wrong with Phillip - he seemed to have it all - it surely offered a great warning to those who ever go on Craigslist.  Never trust or meet anyone you don't know, alone.  What was truly heartbreaking was what happened to Megan McAllister, an innocent victim in this scenario who by all accounts, had no idea what was going on with her finance.  As clumsy a killer he was, leaving behind a mountain of evidence, he seemed to be able to fool the one person who truly loved him.

Although the families of the victims never got their day in court, I find it a blessing that this man is no longer alive and able to hurt anyone else.",1452816000,4,745,4.3768115942028984

4403646,4,B004LROMQ6,"This movie was well done.  How accurate some of the portrayals are, I have no idea.  Things are usually enhanced in these movies.
Overall I think it is worth watching.  Strange young man with everything to look forward to, and very sad about the women he killed or terrorized.  What drives a person to do these things?
I also suggest watching Fatal Desire with Eric Roberts and Anne Heche.  A heads up regarding internet relationships.",1390867200,,435,4.746666666666667

4403649,3,B004LROMQ6,"This is not a story that deserves a film adaptation, however the Lifetime network felt differently and produced a movie based on this very benign story, that captivated the nation. For those who are unaware, this is a true story that happened in Boston, five years ago. A Boston medical student, on the verge of getting married, spends his nights cruising Craigslist's exotic services page, in order to find woman he can humiliate, but the story takes a tragic turn when he accidentally kills one of them. The story made national headlines and people became obsessed with why such a smart, successful man, would do these terrible things. Usually, films that are based on real life events are the most compelling, but the Craigslist Killer is different, for the fact that he wasn't active for very long. Much of this movie is focused on the killer's normal life and relationship with his fiancee. It's a lot of romantic garbage and stuff about their relationship and in fact we don't see his dark side revealed until much later in the movie. There wasn't even an interesting police angle or manhunt for this guy, as the police simply traced his IP address and got his picture from security cameras. The acting was the only thing I enjoyed about this film as Jake McDorman is fantastic playing a man with two personas. His fiancee is played by the beautiful, Agnes Bruckner, who was also very good, if not a bit naive and obsessive. The true story may have captivated the nation, but the film about the Craigslist Killer has no bite and was just plain boring.",1372291200,,1557,4.706959706959707
