6356726,5,B00JG4XZCG,"As a fan of Jeff's other videos, I wasn't certain he could pull off another educational video as good as the first ones. He did it, but this time he gave some delicious non-tomato options for that crowd. #4 is another great option for a homeschool cooking class or anyone wanting to learn to make yummy nutrient dense, plant based, no added fat/salt/sugar/flour meals. Although I already make his other SNAP meals with fresh veg instead of frozen some of the time, his further justification of frozen is compelling.

AND a plug for #1...I'm sitting with my grandchildren (5 and 7) for a week, while their parents are away. Last night we made my version of one of these meals. These children had a blast opening cans plus cutting up zucchini, peppers, mushrooms, and onions. The older one is a girl and tried to get all perfectionist with her younger brother. I told them the veggies didn't have to be cut perfectly, because we were going to chew them up anyway. That got a laugh. When they added everything to the pot, they felt so grown up. Not only did these carnivorous children eat veggies and beans with no complaints, they begged for seconds. From start to finish, our prep and cooking time was 14 minutes. Tonight we'll make the potato/cauliflower curry.",1398902400,31,1261,4.68018018018018

6356731,4,B00JG4XZCG,"Jeff is always fun to watch.  I enjoy his easy going nature and sense of humor.  He presents good ideas for preparing easy, healthy meals. His spicing leaves a bit to be desired, but he provides a good starting point that allows one to flavor the food to their own tastes.  The twins are cute, but I wish they contributed more than the same responses after tasting each dish.  But I would highly recommend any of Jeff's videos for those looking for cheap, healthy, vegan meals.",1426032000,3,477,4.511627906976744

6356734,4,B00JG4XZCG,"Jeff's content is always great.  He could use a little more professional production with better sets, lighting, fewer nostril shots.  A bit fewer ""OK girls, ya ready?""  in the script.  Let the girls do something more than empty an already-opened can.

That said, I highly recommend anything by Jeff Novick.  He's a great teacher and a champion of healthy eating.  There's a recipe PDF on the DVD as well.  Buy it!",1409356800,13,413,4.71830985915493
6356735,5,B00JG4XZCG,Another excellent fast food resource.,1407715200,3,37,6.6
6356736,4,B00JG4XZCG,"I was pleased to see that this DVD was primarily cooking without tomato products.  I was surprised how many people (like me) have problems with tomato products.  I am allergic.  While I find Jeff's cooking a little bland, he has taught me the basics of a healthy plant based diet, and I always can add more spices to my liking.  I am glad to add this one to my collection.  I cannot imagine where he could take it from here as there is just sooo much one can do with beans, grains and frozen veggies.",1403395200,16,500,4.221052631578948
8650653,3,B00JG4XZCG,"Ugh......I just rewatched this video and remembered what drove me crazy about these videos....I have 3 and all have the same issue.  You DON""T see the food.....you see the pots, the bowls, the containers but you don't see the food.  You see ingredients going in the pot, things going into the bowls and mixing being done but you DO NOT see the actual end product.  A career in Food Network not happening.  You gotta see the food....and clearly  Jeff doesn't get that.  I couldn't watch these videos again because of that issue.  Perhaps he ought to realize we are not enamored with him or with the twins.  These videos are to demonstrate recipes and highlight the food....not Jeff Novick.",1506556800,2,688,4.722689075630252
