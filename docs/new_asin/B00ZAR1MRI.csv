8719678,5,B00ZAR1MRI,"I just received this this two film/three disk set ordered from Rarewaves in England. I am happy to report sealed/mint condition package arrived in 20 days rather than promised max of 50 days. Disks were all PAL format as expected from England but not clearly listed 20 days ago when I ordered. However I have found PAL plays fine in my HP desktop using VLC software. BUT NOT IN CONVENTIONAL AMERICAN DVD PLAYER!  All three disks play great including extensive extras (contrary to other reviewer's problems). Thanks for a great price on these important, rare and difficult to find challenging movies!!",1498867200,,600,4.9405940594059405
