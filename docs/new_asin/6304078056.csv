8324531,5,6304078056,"This video has been our family favorite since my 8 year old daughter was 1.  I was happy to find it again on amazon.com to give as gifts.  The music by Judy Collins is beautiful, and very relaxing.  Many times it has put my resistant toddler to sleep, and sometimes Mom or Dad, too.  Some songs are familiar, and some are new.  Our favorite was ""I See the Moon"".  The illustrations add to the feel and mood of the video.  I have watched many children's music videos, but to me, this one is the finest.",970185600,2,501,4.2105263157894735
