Incredible. A busy and popular Hollywood star voluntarily sets aside his time, gets some friends together, and stands with those who stand for us. This is what American film stars 'used to do' when America was indeed the hope of the world. May Gary and the Floras find 'an army' of fellows in this most noble of efforts.
God bless America, and God bless the Lt. Dan Band!",1312848000,5,399,4.405405405405405
4620813,5,B0059B05DW,"Gary Sinise and his band are true Patriots in every sense of the word!!

Cynthia and I just watched Lt Dan's Band for the Common Good!! Great piece on how Gary Sinise has taken his love for Country, the Military, and 1st Responders, and did something about it. Gary's Foundation really gives back, folks. Buy his movie and encourage others to do the same. You will be inspired, motivated and moved!!!
If you rather not buy the movie, at the very least, go to the Lt Dan Band website, [...], and pay $3.99 to stream the movie on your computer. You will be glad you did. Money from streaming the movie supports the Foundation.

Cynthia and I are retired Army (Still serving as Retirees).

God Bless LT Dan and His Band!!",1312848000,5,718,4.465648854961832
4620814,5,B0059B05DW,What an outstanding evening of entertainment watching Gary Sinise and his Lt. Dan Band entertain our military men and women and their families. It brought lots of smiles and a few tears. Gary is the Bob Hope of this military generation. Well done all around!,1312848000,3,258,4.7555555555555555

4620816,5,B0059B05DW,"Best movie I have ever seen. Gary Sinise is doing so much for our troops, first responders of 9/11 it is unreal what he has done so far. I feel everone should watch this movie and see what is actually going on in Afganistan from the troops own mouths not our federal government. Gary is the next Bob Hope!!! He cares so much about people he gives up his weekends to travel all over the world just to help people in need to live a more normal life. He is a wonderful person!!! EVERYONE NEEDS TO BUY THIS MOVIE!!! I CAN'T EXPRESS THIS ENOUGH. Part of the sales go to the Gary Sinise foundation so he can continue to help people in need. He even raised over 200,000.00 for the NYPD wall to be created for the people who were lost in 9/11.",1312761600,3,735,4.146853146853147
4620817,5,B0059B05DW,"""Lt. Dan Band: For The Common Good"" is an exceptional full-length documentary movie that rallies all who experience it around our flag, our nation, and the men and women who selflessly serve our country and daily place themselves in harm's way.  At this time in our nation's history, when partisan wrangling and vitriol, media bias, and political grandstanding dominate the culture and airwaves, this movie rallies everyone who watches it around what really matters - those who throughout history, but especially today, voluntarily put their lives on the line to defend us and our enduring freedoms.

Actor Gary Sinise created the role of Lt. Dan Taylor in Robert Zemeckis' award-winning landmark 1994 movie ""Forrest Gump.""  In this role, Lt. Dan himself becomes a role model for so many - a soldier from a long line of military men who have died in battle, only to be fortuitously, yet reluctantly saved on the battlefield, being left wheelchair-bound as a cripple.  Lt. Dan falls on deeply hard times, but then rebounds with a vengeance when he and Forrest build the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, ultimately becoming very wealthy and getting a set of space-age prosthetic legs to boot.  Sinise had performed on TV and in film in various roles prior to that, but the endearing character of Lt. Dan made him a favorite of moviegoers and Americans at large.  His success in that role propelled him to further great acting roles, including leads in ""Apollo 13,"" ""The Green Mile,"" ""Mission to Mars,"" but most recently and prominently as Detective Mac Taylor (Taylor - a coincidence?) on the popular member of TV's CSI franchise, ""CSI: New York.""  One of his most triumphant and exemplary roles may indeed be as himself, as leader and bassist of the Lt. Dan Band.

One part of Sinise's life that few know is his devotion to support our men and women in uniform in the military and as first responders, by traveling to war zones, army bases, and other key locations worldwide, most often in the relative discomfort of military transport aircraft and vehicles, performing with his rock group, the Lt. Dan Band.  ""Lt. Dan Band: For The Common Good"" is a masterpiece of documentary filmmaking produced and directed by the very talented filmmaker Jonathan Flora and his wife Deborah, taking the viewer along with Gary Sinise and the Lt. Dan Band as they travel the globe, often into active war zones, entertaining and effusively demonstrating support for our men and women stationed around the world.  The film shows those men and women typically moved to tears by the love and support of Sinise and his team.

Jonathan Flora is a staff producer with Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment, but he and Deborah also lead their own production company, Lamplight Entertainment.  But Jonathan is also a veteran of the US Army's 82nd Airborne Division, having served over a decade in the armed forces, and is much beloved by his own following of former and current soldiers.  As a masterful filmmaker, Flora is intimate and illustrative with his style, and we feel as though we are right there traveling with Sinise and his colleagues, interviewing those he meets along the way, as well as various celebrities whose attention Sinise has captured, including veteran actors Robert Duvall and Jon Voight.

""Lt. Dan Band: For The Common Good"" will warm your heart and restore your appreciation of and gratitude to our military, regardless of your political persuasion.  If only there were more cultural luminaries in our society with the devotion, dedication, sincerity, and talent combined as Sinise and the Floras.

I wholeheartedly recommend ""Lt. Dan Band: For The Common Good"" to every American and fan of Gary Sinise worldwide.  It is a wonderful, entertaining, impressive patriotic piece of documentary filmmaking.",1311897600,35,3799,5.014308426073132
4620818,5,B0059B05DW,"I got a chance to see LT. DAN BAND: FOR THE COMMON GOOD at last winter's Sedona Film Festival in Arizona and became an instant cheerleader for the film.

At a glance, you may think that it's just a concert film of actor Gary Sinise playing for troops but you'd be wrong: it's so much more than that.  Always moving at a brisk pace, the film features how Sinise came to be so involved in our troops (including a fascinating back story for Lt. Dan's character in FORREST GUMP), his career as an actor, how he came to form the band, a history of the USO, his visits to Iraq & other theatres of operations as well as meeting our troops and their struggles both in combat and recovery.  There's so much here and you come away from the film with such a better understanding because of it.

It is also a very emotional film as well.  I can't imagine a dry eye after watching the sequence where the band plays for the children of fallen soldiers.

I am not connected to this film at all so I'm not benefiting personally by saying this, but: every American should see this film.  And everyone else should see it to understand what makes America so special.",1311897600,25,1147,4.331775700934579

4620821,5,B0059B05DW,This is a great DVD about Lt. Dan Band. It was filmed at some of the USO tours he has made with the band. I am a veteran and can really relate to the good moments in the film. Very good old rock and roll from the 60's. Plenty of good heart warming scenes in the movie. Best $19 I've spent in a long time.,1384473600,,304,3.6923076923076925

4620824,5,B0059B05DW,"This DVD was very well done.  But before I bought this DVD, I bought tickets for a fundraising concert for Juan Dominguez, Marine, a triple amputee, as a result of a bomb in Afghanistan.  The Gary Sinise Foundation was raising funds to build a Smart home for Juan in Temecula, CA.  When I heard Juan's story I just broke down and started crying!  He was in a coma at Walter Reed Hospital and when he woke up, he noticed the vacant look on his nurse's face and he told her, ""Don't be sad...I would do it all again for my country.""  I made up my mind I was going to this concert, no matter what!  Of course the band playing was Gary Sinise's Lt. Dan Band!  What an incredible group of musicians...this was an awesome concert!  This was an outdoor concert, and two days before they added an additional 1,000 seats!

When I got home from the concert, I went onto Amazon to see if they had any CDs' or DVDs' on the Lt. Dan Band and I found, ""Lt. Dan Band: For The Common Good.""  The DVD opens with footage from 9-11 and then later, Gary surveying the devastation at Ground Zero.  He explains how he got involved after 9-11, how he wanted to give something back...to our FDNY firemen and our Military fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.  He goes into details how the Lt. Dan Band came to be...how they became a perfect fit.  There is a lot of footage of the band playing at Military bases when he got involved with the USO.  The Lt. Dan Band is constantly doing fundraisers to raise money for Smart homes for other triple and quad amputees...16 others that I know of.  He also raises money for Wounded Warriors, and the Stephen Siller, Tunnel to Towers Foundation, to name two.

You won't be able to view this DVD without a box of kleenex!  Since I bought the first DVD, I have since purchased two more to lend out to friends!  Very well done...I highly recommend it!",1351468800,2,1859,4.339130434782609
4620825,5,B0059B05DW,"This was a great movie that shows a man who really cares about our troops and it was neat to see why he felt the way he did. I didn't realize he had so much family in the military.

One little drawback, no closed caption. Even though I have noticed most movies/TV shows on DVD are not having the sound loud enough, you have to turn up the volume on your TV or computer.",1349049600,,369,3.9864864864864864

I have since donated the video to my American Legion Post for others to view.  It is seldom that we get a chance to see the positive actions that other people dedicate themselves to, the differences they make in someone else's life and Gary Sinise is truly making that difference with his performances for the 9/11 responders and our troops.

This is an EXCELLENT DVD. It will give you amazing insight into what Saddam did to his people in Iraq, what the troops see and experience in Afghanistan and the good that they do, and what 9/11 was like for all the heroic NYFD firefighters, NYPD and the rest of the courageous first responders that were there that day. Gary Sinise really is a ""Patriot"" for all the support he provides and assists with for all of our troops and first responders. To be honest, I cannot say enough good about this DVD...just get it!

4620844,5,B0059B05DW,"I met Gary Sinise while I was stationed in Iraq in 2008. When you're in a combat zone, you learn how to read people and situations very quickly....your life depends on it. Gary was different than all the other celebrities that came through. He was the only one that came to where we launched our missions from, and you could tell that he was more impressed with meeting us soldiers, than he wanted us to be impressed with meeting him. A very humble and gracious man, a soldier's best supporter, and a true Patriot! I'm truly thankful that Gary gives so much of his time and talent to show us soldiers his support. Thank you Gary!

And director Jonathan Flora has put together a wonderful and moving film! Some things are life changing. This film is life challenging! It will challenge and motivate you as no other film you've seen. The film captures the spirit that made this country great....sacrifice over self. And I hope it will help all of us get back to a spirit of service and sacrificing 'for the common good'! Not everyone has the physical ability to serve in our armed forces....but we can all do our part to help this country stay great.

4620847,5,B0059B05DW,"Gary Sinise will even go to remote outposts to visit with the troops - even just a few of them.  That means so much to the average ""grunt"".  (I know that from personal experience - Robert Mitchum actually visited our enlisted mens' club in Phu Bai in '66).

But to the DVD:  I especially liked the parts about Gary's history, and his wife and kids.

The quality of the DVD is good, and the images are at the 1.78:1 aspect ratio.

Don't loan this DVD to anyone - you might not see it again.",1314403200,,489,4.148936170212766
4620848,5,B0059B05DW,"I really enjoyed this film from the beginning to the end.  My only criticism is that the final scene of Sinise in the bus dwells on his distressed look too long.  The message is clear that he gets very emotional about the loss of lives in this useless war.  Who wouldn't?  The film is more about Sinise than the band and its adventures.  Maybe that was intentional!

I wish I had seen more of Ernie Denov rather than the many close-ups of his hands that didn't show that it was him playing.  Some players were interviewed more than others.  Why was it always necessary to show Danny Gottlieb AND Beth Gottlieb, even when Beth had nothing to say?  But, those are small matters that could have made the film even better than it was.

Regardless of my knit-picking, I think this film is headed for an Oscar if documentaries are one of the categories that receive consideration.  Over-all, the film was extremely well done, and I would highly recommend it.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lt-Dan-Band-For-The-Common-Good/dp/B0059B05DW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lt.

It is heartwarming to see the good that is being done.  The wonderful thing is all the band members are spotlighted - the focus is not all on Mr. Sinise.  There came a point in the film where I broke down in tears watching a concert for those military families who lost a member.

4620852,5,B0059B05DW,"""Lt. Dan Band:  For The Common Good"" isn't a film made by Gary Sinise.  Rather, through diverse interviews and video footage of band tours and personal appearances, it details the journey of Mr. Sinise and his compatriots into their dedicated service to active and veteran members of the United States armed services and their families, to the first responders of 911 and their families, as well as to the families of those servicemen and servicewomen and first responders who have given their lives to preserve the way the rest of us in the free world, especially in the United States of America, [should] live ours.

While ""Lt. Dan Band:  For The Common Good"" is a film about service, it has, as its foundation, gratitude.  In fact, gratitude pervades its every frame as we learn that it is the catalyst leading to service ""for the common good"" by the Lt. Dan Band.  And it reminds us that the common factor at the core of our military personnel's and first responders' voluntary willingness to lay down their lives ""for the common good,"" is developed from the gratitude they feel for the gift of freedom.  After viewing ""Lt. Dan Band:  For The Common Good,"" don't expect to ever again think of gratitude without associating it with service.  Do expect to understand that service isn't always glamorous and it isn't necessarily ""tireless.""  On the contrary, people in service, especially our military and first responders are human and they get tired, very tired; they get wet, soaked to the bone; they get cold, chilled to the core; they hunger and they thirst, and they know loneliness intimately.  The difference is that they push through such discomforts, secure in their self-abnegation.  When we, as civilian citizens, push through such discomforts we may encounter while in service to these heroes and their families, we come through better friends, better neighbors, better people, better Americans.

On the evening that my wife and I sat down together to watch ""Lt. Dan Band: For The Common Good,"" we knew that we were in for something that would touch our hearts; what we didn't expect was the way it would touch our lives.  We've always felt blessed to be able to give through monetary donations, and we'll continue to give in this way, but this film motivated us to do more; to get out and serve, in whatever capacity we are needed, to those who serve us and to their families who also sacrifice so much.  To do so will be both an expression of our gratitude to our heroes as well as service ""for the common good.""",1313539200,,2528,4.752860411899314

4620857,5,B0059B05DW,"If you love this country; if you love that we have a volunteer military who knows the truth of their mission and their jobs; if you wish you could go over and hug the men and women and just let them know how much we appreciate them; if you want to do a wee more than shaking hands with any men and women in uniform or first responders you see and thank them... THEN GO BUY THIS DVD!!!

I cannot find enough superlatives to describe this movie! The producers, the Lt Dan Band, and others involved have put together a project that not only reveals the hearts of the people involved, but goes the extra mile to show the AMAZING military we have. The Lt Dan Band doesn't perform for themselves - they do it to give back to the very special men and women in our military and first responders. If I could personally thank Jonathan and Deborah Flora and Gary Sinise and Lt Dan Band, I would. This is going to be all of our extended family Christmas gifts this year - a great investment and encouragement to all of us to tell these heros thank you!!!",1312848000,,1042,4.236180904522613
