2712391,5,B000LPS2SQ,"my nephew couldn't stop watch... he loves the myth busters
why do you require so many words? I will stop giving reviews this is not an English class.",1356739200,,149,4.357142857142857
2712392,5,B000LPS2SQ,My grandson is addicted to Mythbusters.  We were constantly recording them and filling up the storage space on the DVR.  Now the shows are available whenever he wants to watch them,1328400000,,180,4.774193548387097
2712393,5,B000LPS2SQ,"To be honest I purchased this item as a gift for my uncle who's a movie buff but at the same time is a very smart man and can tell the difference when something can actually happen and when it's just special effects.
He's told me he's very pleased with the dvd.  I being a fan of the show knew he'd like it.",1275955200,2,307,3.873015873015873
2712394,5,B000LPS2SQ,"I'm a filmmaker, so this seemed like the perfect gift for me to get for the un-buyable geek dad. Though, I'll admit, my dad was rarely surprised by the myths busted and figured them out before the answer was revealed (*sigh* engineers...). Despite that, he seemed to enjoy the special. I'm glad I purchased this Mythbusters for my dad.",1229644800,7,335,4.694915254237288
2712395,5,B000LPS2SQ,"My kids LOVE Mythbusters.  They are 8 & 12 year old girls who love the way the Mythbusters explain science as if it's part of the fun - which it is!  They love knowing the ""secrets""  behind the movie magic.  And the best part is that the it's  ""family viewing""  that entertains the grown-ups, too.",1209686400,6,297,4.3090909090909095
2712396,4,B000LPS2SQ,"Mythbusters Mega Movie Myths is great TV. The Mythbusters team is absolutely entertaining and informative. They approach science in a fun and inquisitive way like science should be approached. Without creativity and a sense of humor, we would know far less about our planet and our universe. The only thing that could make this DVD more fun is if it was widescreen.",1199750400,3,365,4.903225806451613
2712397,4,B000LPS2SQ,"This was an excellent DVD. Many popular movie stunts are debunked and demystified. It's appropriate, as Jamie and Adam have experience with F/X in the movies. I also purchased this on Feb. 17, 2007 from Wal-Mart. For some reason they have it out on the shelves a month early. Must have been a mistake. Oh, well... better enjoy it. It's rare when a store makes a mistake in your favor.",1171670400,3,384,4.5

8163451,5,B000LPS2SQ,Yet another great DVD by the Mythbusters team. I would expect no less from them. They make kids want to watch because secretly they are learning! I could watch an entire channel dedicated to showing Mythbusters 24/7!,1460332800,,216,4.864864864864865

8163453,5,B000LPS2SQ,"I have been taping all the Mythbuster shows I can off our cable network and my husband loves to watch one a night after dinner,  He really enjoyed this and I would recommend it to any Mythbuster fan.",1445990400,,199,4.2368421052631575
8163454,4,B000LPS2SQ,"great video, but wish the language had been edited...kids like it because they have seen or aware of some of the movies.",1434931200,,120,4.5

8163459,3,B000LPS2SQ,"Many of the experiments seemed to semantically avoid the real issue.  If a sword breaks when hit with another sword, that's what most of us see in a movie sword fight, it's not necessarily cutting the sword.  Too much of the interns and not enough Adam and Jamie!",1386288000,,263,4.458333333333333
