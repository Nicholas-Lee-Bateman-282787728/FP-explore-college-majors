6675097,5,B00NP06EKW,"Since there is no summary on the Amazon page for this release, I will add a Plot Summary (no spoilers).

Plot Summary:  The Grand Magic Games is a yearly competition that pits guild against guild in a battle for the honor of being called the most powerful wizards in the Fiore Kingdom. Fairy Tail has come in last place for the past seven tournaments, but now that all their strongest members are back in action, they're determined to take the number one spot and rebuild their reputation! Winning the games won't be easy, though, as Natsu and his selected teammates are forced to navigate enchanted labyrinths, battle wizard saints, and go head-to-head with a host of familiar faces and some new ones. But with more than one guild targeting Fairy Tail before the competition even begins, the guildmates will be lucky if they even make it out of the opening ceremonies alive.

The guilds are ready to rumble!",1416268800,6,908,4.734177215189874

6675100,5,B00NP06EKW,"So I knew that the anime was fastly approaching the point of the manga and would be taking a break soon: whether you were a fan of the manga or just love the anime like myself and heard a rumor about it somewhere on the internet. So I figured, I would take my break from Fairy Tail and let the anime get ahead while I catch up with my so many other anime shows that I have ignored. But now it's time, time for me to catch up, time for the Fairy Tail team to catch up on the training they missed out on the past 7 years, it is time...

For the Magic games.

But of course the first thing I do, I catch up on some of my Fairy Tail and I found it weird that we don't realize how much weaker the Fairy Tail team is until part 14. In reality is the last few episodes of 13, which makes me think that Infinity Clock might have been the anime trying to stretch the show why the manga got ahead. Just felt weird having them being really strong during the Infinity Clock and saving the guild then have Natsu barely beat a lower level wizard. Low its just one of those things we just have to go through: a good audience ignores it and goes with the punches and in a magical tournament there are plenty of them.

There are plenty of action, intrigue, great new characters and some returning favorites, and great moments between all the characters as always. The magical games are both entertaining and action packed. To be honest I am glad I decided to wait, because The Magical Games are becoming one of my favorite story arcs so far of Fairy Tail. I don't think I could have waited a long time if I was so invested in the story, like I am already.

Love it so much that the copy that I got from Amazon was damaged and I am still willing to give it a five star rating and was unwilling to send it back so I can watch it over and over.",1455408000,,1824,4.030386740331492
