2648712,5,B000HXDWO6,"What would you do if someone came to your door and asked if you if you found Jesus? If you were Lothar Schramm you would invite them in and kill them after offering them a beverage. Yes folks this is the world of Schramm a 65 minute look into the bizzare world that only a shock meister like Jorg Buttergreit could come up with.

The film is basically the last 24 hours of the so called ""Lipstick Killer"" Lothar Schramm who while trying to clean the blood from the walls of his latest kill falls of a ladder and dies in the beginning. The film explores his relationship with a prostitute who has a new, rich, old, and perverse client that lives next door to him and has loud sex that can be heard through Lothar's air duct.

The film has realy not much of a plot structure, the main plot about Lothar and his relationship with the prostitute is interspersed with scence of a man and woman dancing to a haunting score in a smokey dimly lit area,and Lothar's own delusions including a Vagina like creature with teeth and the loss of his own leg and a scene of Lothar driving several nails into his foreskin  on a table in full view of the camera.

In reality Mr Buttergreit is trying to show the mind of a killer not the actions unlike films like Henry Portait of a Serial Killer where the actions are shown. We are only shown one murder, the rest is the psychosocial interactions and delusions. This is a case study of the mind not a film record of the murders of a killer. In saying this the film is relatively short going over an hour by only five minutes but within that short time frame you see the realty of a damaged human mind.

Like other shock films like the Guinea Pig series out of Japan and Russia's Philosophy of a Knife this film tries to test the limits of the viewer, how much can you stand before you shut off the dvd player and put in Snow White to calm you down. Hollywood is now trying to catch up to its european and asian counterparts with films like Hostel and Saw but real shock cinema is from overseas as these films show. Hostel's violence is tame compared to this, I doubt the MPAA would allow a director here to show a man nailing his foreskin to a table in full view of the camera nor would I expect them to show a man having sex with then cleaning a blow up doll or ejaculating on magazines. This is shock in its pure form. Few directors in the states have done it but some have tried.

If you are daring try this film on for size as well as Nekromantik, all the Guinea Pig films, and Philosophy of a Knife. If you can sit through it without feeling some sort of disturbance then you have something wrong",1256774400,,2633,4.235059760956175
2648713,1,B000HXDWO6,"let me start by saying i am a huge fan of cult, horror, and gore...but, schramm let me down immensely.  do not compare this movie to henry: portrait of a serial killer.  as the movie starts, i waited (and waited) for it to get going.  giving it a chance i kept watching.  it never picks up.  the gore that is ""promised"" is a let down.  i felt more shocked watching ""i spit on your grave"" than i did watching this.  save your money and your time.",1233187200,2,445,4.104651162790698
2648714,2,B000HXDWO6,"What may have started out as an interesting premise...ends up as an uninteresting mess of a serial killer flick.

If only the filmmaker had spent more time developing his storyline and his characters, instead of trying to shock...it may have resulted in a better film.",1216684800,2,268,4.955555555555556

2648717,5,B000HXDWO6,"Well, I really thought that I had seen everything until viewing this film.  It has much going for it in the area of lensing and camera work.  The acting is well done.  One might wonder how a short one hour film could be so disturbing, but there are images here that ring more real than ""Faces of Death.""  Other reviewers have mentioned some spoilers, but I will only say that sometimes it seems that the cinematographer just happened upon some weird event that appeared in the film unplanned.  We just happened by to catch this fellow blowing his brains out.  Let's show the world. Looky! Looky!

I must admit that there were scenes in this film that were really difficult to watch.  That has never happened to me except when I saw a film called ""Death Scenes.""  There were images that made me want to wash my mind out with soap.  Does anyone know what I mean?  Just try eating a sandwich and watching this film at the same time, I do not believe it can be done. The real question is does anyone really want this kind of thing floating around in their brain?  ""Schramm"" Rates as the goriest film that I have ever seen, and I do not believe I will watch it again.

Now, it is your turn.  Do you want it in your brain floating around?",1193875200,9,1232,4.3
2648718,4,B000HXDWO6,"This is October and I wanted to view some horror.  I like horror movies about serial killers, so after reading another review by my Amazon buddy, M., I bought this one.  This movie dealt more with the mind of the serial killer than to his haunting craft.  The character, Lothar was dubbed the ""lipstick killer"".  This film opens up as he is dying in a pool of his own blood and he has flashbacks on his life.  You saw how a serial killer begins with a mind that is twisted and demented.  Lothar even obsessess over a certain female whore, who was his neighbor.  This movie has a good amount of gore as Lothar did kill a couple of religious freaks that came to his door to sell religion.  But then, who hasn't had that thought when they come to your door, after you get home from a long day at work!  For all you gore hounds, this movie even has masochism as he maims himself with a hammer and a few nails on his private parts.  Interestingly enough, I read that they actually used a stunt person that really did pound nails into his private parts, ouch!  This film did hold my interest, although I kind of wanted more.  It is also subtitled, so you have to read quickly.  But, very, very entertaining.",1191542400,2,1201,4.308035714285714
2648719,4,B000HXDWO6,"""Schramm"" is a movie that got my attention in a video store, both with the cover and the back cover that exclaimed that it was similar to Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, one of my favorite horror films. If you've seen Henry, you realize that there's actually a pretty big restraint on blood and gore. It's existent, but it's not that bad. The movie used atmosphere and Michael Rooker's performance to creep you out. Schramm goes up another level on that. In Schramm you get a no holds barred look at the life of a serial killer... And it's all done in 64 minutes, which makes it kind of impressive. This movie also is probably the truest account of what goes on behind a serial killers' door. Movies about serial killers show that they kill and, sometimes, why. But few films show the really dirty things about serial killers. This film gives us the self-mutilation, necrophilia, and sexual deviancy. The movie is in German and I got to praise the Germans for making a movie like this. I don't think an American director would touch this kind of material with a ten-foot pole. And if he did, he'd tone it down a lot. I, regrettably, don't remember the main characters name...But I know this. The movie begins with a newspaper headline that explains that the Lipstick Killer has died. He is, of course, our aforementioned killer. The movie works its way back from that. The prostitute that lives across the hall from him, whom he's actually good friends with, sets something off in his head that makes him begin to kill. In the movie, the body count is pretty low...But this is still very gory. One scene which is bound to make men who watch this cringe, involve the guy taking his d**k and pounding nails through it. There's also one of the most interesting and unique ideas I've seen. A disembodied vag**a with teeth. The movie suffers from a disjointed timeline. The movie's about an insane serial killer...But the look of the movie implies it's about a schizophrenic serial killer. The grainy, old movieish look the film has, however, also helps with the creepiness. This is not a ""good"" movie, but it's effective and does something that other movies about serial killers should do (instead of crap like Dahmer, Ted Bundy, Gacy, etc.). If you want to see a movie that frequently has you asking yourself ""What the f**k?"" This is a good movie for you.

8142431,1,B000HXDWO6,"Wow do I feel sorry for anyone paying big bucks to acquire this stinker. I'm always amazed, as a lifelong horror/gore/sci fi fan, at the terrible films that get decent reviews.

Was able to watch good quality bootleg and glad I didn't buy. Not worth $5. Director's past movie 'Nekromantic' was at least interesting and was something new (and sick and gory) at the time. This film is boring, drawn out, limited gore, bad photography, just plain crappy. Don't be a sucker. Really a major disappointment. Total and absolute crap.",1467763200,,526,4.844444444444444

8142436,2,B000HXDWO6,"No SpOiLerS.

I really like this kind of movies and the Human Centiped II is REALLY sick option in comparison to this one.

So O.K., what do we have here? A gory movie? Nope, not at all (in MY opinion). At the end of the 80's this would be a disturbing movie but by these days, I dont'd think so. Dont take me wrong, I've even kinda like the background music (you're gonna listen to it a LOT of times within the movie)and the end, well, it was somehow unexpected, so I liked it.

As other guy reviewed, the movie is really slow, repeating 1, 2, 3 up to 4 or more times the same thing; I understand all the movie goes around flashbacks, but there are TOO many of them, plus the SAME music and some ""low budget"" effects like the brain, the vagina or the poor penis(I still have in doubt if the guy really smashed his penis in the movie and if he did it, I'm really sorry for him, that is just stupid).

I don't know, I cannot recommend it, and $60.00 for it??? What the f#c+? Come on, is this for real?",1379808000,,1000,4.060913705583756
8142437,2,B000HXDWO6,"I have scene people say that this film is truly shocking, but if you are a true horror fan all I have to say is skip it. Made by the director of two of the most shocking films ever made. His name is Jorg Buttgereit the infamous director of the Nekromantik films. This one is about the serial lipstick killer, and one would think he would have done a good job with this true and evil sicko, but I say it is horrible. I hope he does better next film.",1347062400,,448,3.988888888888889

like Schramm.
it has some slow spots, but does deliver the goods(and bads) >:-) when necessary.

its not very long, but it does provide some insight of the ticking of the s.killer's mind.

Its more a 3.5 than a 3 tho.

8142439,5,B000HXDWO6,"Schramm is the most accessible of Jorg Buttegereit's movies, yet is still incredibly disturbing. Schramm is a serial killer, at least he dreams of being one. Like many German horror movies, Schramm uses dreams and psychological character studies to create a world unto itself. The title character is dying, and his life, dream or real, is told to us through flashbacks--his desire to kill, his pain at being unable to feel something, anything, his plots of killings that will relieve the tension and pain that he experiences. The movie is extremely graphic, with one particular scene involving Schramm's genitals that could disturb the most hard-core horror fan, and be rather embarrassing to others. But Schramm is worth seeing, as a excellent character study and fascinating use of dream horror to take us deep inside the psyche of a very troubled man. In German with English subtitles.",1287187200,,888,5.089041095890411
8142440,2,B000HXDWO6,"This movie could have been amazing. It starts off very well then loses steam way too quickly. Even though it's relatively short, it still feels like it takes forever to get through. Don't be fooled by people telling you it's some kind of gory splatterfest either, it's not. There are maybe 2 gory scenes in the film, 3 tops if I recall correctly.

This movie is about a serial killer named Lothar who is friends with a hooker who lives across the hall from him. He comes off as a nice guy who is easy to talk to, but obviously that is only a disguise. He asks her a lot of questions and listens to her having sex with men in her apartment. Part of him wants to protect her, the other loathes what she does.

The beginning shows Lothar lying dead in a pool of his own blood, basically showing us the ending of the film. What follows is everything that led up to that moment. We see him killing some people who come into his home asking him about accepting Jesus into his life. He invites them in for a drink and them violently murders them.

The problem is that we keep seeing scenes being repeated over and over again. In a movie that's barely over an hour, why do we need to be shown the same scenes 3 or 4 times? There are also long scenes of Lothar having sex with a doll and cleaning it out, as well as boring conversations between him and his neighbor.

The main gruesome scene is where Lothar takes a bunch of nails and hammers them into his penis and scrotum. Supposedly, the actor did this for real, which truly is a disturbing thing to think about.

Overall, this movie isn't very good. It's not the worst movie ever, but it's disappointing to see how the movie goes from being interesting to outright boring and tedious. If you're that curious, rent it or borrow it from a friend, but I still think you'll extremely disappointed.",1280707200,2,1839,4.334302325581396
