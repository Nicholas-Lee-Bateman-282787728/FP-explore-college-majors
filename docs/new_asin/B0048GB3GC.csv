8418667,5,B0048GB3GC,"Wesele is a film I have seen and loved years ago. Since it is not a popular film like other Wajda films, it is difficult to find its DVD. Thus it is a great chance being able to reach this DVD. I should thank Mr. Jarek Malinowski whose establishment has marketed the DVD.
As to the critique of the film, I believe that this rather less-known Wajda film needs an evaluation from a more competent person in films. For me, its a great film.",1404259200,,437,4.214285714285714
