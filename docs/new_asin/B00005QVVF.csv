7950903,4,B00005QVVF,"With Season 3 ""M*A*S*H"" settled in for the long haul.  Producers Gene Reynold and Larry Gelbart had gathered anecdotes and firsthand observations at the 43rd Army Surgical Hospital in Korea (the 8055 was no longer mobile) which were worked into various episodes.  As Gelbart later explained, it was difficult to come back from doing all those interviews and hear what things were really like during the Korean War and still be funny.  Fortunately, the show was still high in the ratings (finishing 5th for the 1974-75 season) and could now mix heavy material in with the comedy, as can be seen from the first eight episodes:
(49) ""The General Flipped at Dawn"" (Writer: Jim Fritzell & Everett Greenbaum; Aired: September 10, 1974) has a new spit-and-polish general (Harry Morgan) showing up and deciding that moving the 4077th right onto the battlefield would be a good thing.  Grade B: On the one hand the idea of a general being this nuts is unrealistic, but the general is played by Harry Morgan who, ironically, would be back one year later as Sherman Potter.
(50) ""Rainbow Bridge"" (Writers: Larry Gelbart & Laurence Marks; Aired: September 17, 1974) has Trapper (Wayne Rogers) and Hawkeye (Alan Alda) giving up a furlough to go after a group of wounded soldiers in enemy territory.  Grade B-: Clearly inspired by the interviews conducted in Korea, but a bit much of a transition after the season premier episode.  Singer Loudon Wainwright III, who would offer some musical accompaniment from time to time during the third season, makes his first appearance.
(51) ""Officer of the Day"" (Writer: Laurence Marks; Aired: September 24, 1974) has Henry on R&R in Seoul and Hawkeye forced to act as O.D.  If that was not enough trouble, Colonel Flagg (Edward Winter) is back at the 4077th wanting to execute a wounded North Korean prisoner as a spy.  Grade B+: One of the first times that Hawkeye has to act like a real soldier.
(52) ""Iron Guts Kelly"" (Writers: Larry Gelbart & Sid Dorman; Aired: October 1, 1974) has the famous genral (James Gregory) dying in the bed of Hot Lips (Margaret Swit).  However, that is not heroic enough of a death for the general's aide (Keene Curtis).  Grade A-:  ""M*A*S*H"" was becoming more realistic and more of a dramedy than a situation comedy, but black comedy was also one of their strengths as this episode proves.
(53) ""O.R."" (Writers: Larry Gelbart & Laurence Marks; Aired: October 8, 1974) is set entirely in the operating room and is played without a laugh track.  The casualties never stop coming and even Sidney Freedman (Allan Arbus) has to help.  Grade A+: The stark realism of ""M*A*S*H"" was never more evident than on this stellar episode.
(54) ""Springtime"" (Writers: Linda Bloodworth & Mary Kay Place; Aired: October 15, 1974) has both Radar (Gary Burghoff) and Klinger (Jamie Farr) falling in love.  Meanwhile, a grateful G.I. (Alex Karras) looks out for Hawkeye.  Grade C+: Standard military sitcom episode, suffers from following ""O.R.""
(55) ""Checkup"" (Writer: Laurence Marks; Aired: October 22, 1974) finds Trapper suffering from a ulcer which turns out to be his ticket home.  This requires a big party to say goodbye during which Hot Lips confesses a few things to Trapper.  Grade B: Worth it for the look on Margaret's face when she realizes Trapper will be staying.
 (56) ""Life With Father"" (Writers: Everett Greenbaum & Jim Fritzell; Aired: October 29, 1974) has Father Mulcahy (William Christopher) officiating at an infant's circumcision while Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson) is convinced his wife is having an affair back home with a doctor who drives a Jaguar.  Grade C+: Nice to see Henry get a case of the doubts, but an average episode redeemd by the camp's priest getting something better to do than administer last rites.
This first videotape offers up two classic episodes, which is pretty good.  Unfortunately, some of the other episodes are pretty average and keep Volume 1 of Season 3 from earning 5 stars.  Historically these episodes set up Season 4 when Harry Morgan would join the cast and Wayne Rogers would leave, both of which remind us that the best of ""M*A*S*H"" is yet to come.",1055203200,,4152,4.8944365192582024
7950904,5,B00005QVVF,"Volume 3 of Season 1 of ""M*A*S*H"" offers the best and worst episode from the debut season.  More importantly, it offers the most important episode in the history of the classic television situation comedy because it is the one that established ""M*A*S*H"" as a true dramedy, able to do both comedy and drama:
(17) ""Sometimes You Hear the Bullet"" (Writer: Carl Kleinschmitt; Aired: January 28, 1973).  Hawkeye gets a visit from Tommy (James Callahan), an old friend who is planning to write a book about the war.  Meanwhile, the camp also has an underage Marine (Ronny Howard) with appendicitis.  The turning point for ""M*A*S*H"" comes when suddenly Hawkeye finds Tommy on the O.R. table in front of him and can do nothing to save his friend's life.  Grade A+: This was the show that allowed ""M*A*S*H"" to have it both ways.  As Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson) explains it to Hawkeye, ""In war Rule #1 is that young men die.  And Rule #2 is that doctors cannot change rule #1.""  A devastatingly emotional episode that redefined the show.
(18) ""Dear Dad...Again"" (Writers: Sheldon Keller & Larry Gelbart; Aired: February 4, 1973) has Hawkeye writing home to his dad again to talk about how he is keeping himself sane amidst the insanity of war.  Grade B: Another solid character study on the characters at the 4077th.
(19) ""The Long-john Flap (Writer: Alan Alda; Aired: February 18, 1973) has everybody in camp trying to trade or otherwise coerce someone to get Hawkeye's long-johns during a bitter cold snap.  Grade B-: Another military comedy situation, but Alda the writer shows a sense of understanding the characters at the 4077th.
(20) ""The Army-Navy Game"" (Writer: Sid Dorfman, based on a Story by McLean Stevenson; Aired: February 25, 1973) finds the gang's enjoyment of the Army-Navy game on Armed Forces Radio interrupted when an unexploded bomb lands in the middle of the camp.  Grade C+: Another average military comedy episode, with an okay punch line.
(21) ""Sticky Wicket"" (Writers: Laurence Marks & Larry Gelbart; Aired: March 4, 1973) starts with Hawkeye accusing Frank of botching a surgery only to see one of his own patients going sour big time.  Grade B: An interesting episode because the pacifist Hawkeye ends up physically assaulting Frank, while the obnoxious Major Burns is the one who has the moment of objectivity in the end.
(22) ""Major Fred C. Dobbs"" (Writer: Sid Dorfman; Aired: March 11, 1973) reveals that Frank Burns is going home.  This would seem like a good thing but Frank will not be replaced so the boys have to figure out a way to trick Frank into staying.  So they learn from Radar that thar is gold in them Korean hills.  Grade C-: I do not hate this one as much as Gelbart, but it is strange for Hawkeye and Trapper to go out of their way to keep Frank around.
(23) ""Ceasefire"" (Writers: Laurence Marks & Larry Gelbart; Aired: March 18, 1973) has everyone at the 4077th reading to pack up and go home when there are rumors of a ceasefire.  The wars ends and everybody goes in a tearful finale.  No, wait, wrong season.  Grade B: This episode, which aired the same week the U.S. began bringing troops home from Vietnam, offers another nice little character study of the group.
(24) ""Showtime"" (Writers: Robert Klane & Larry Gelbart; Aired: March 25, 1973) is more of an epilogue to the season (""Ceasefire"" works better as a season finale).  The show essentially contrasts a USO comedy show visiting the camp with the drama in the operating room.  Grade B-: A subtle episode, but one that reflects the hard lessons learned during Season 1.
This tape is the key one from Season 1 and it rates 5 stars simply because it includes ""Sometimes You Hear the Bullet.""  Very rarely has an episode other than a pilot transformed a television series so much for the better (cliffhangers like ""Who Shot J.R.?"" do not count).  That episode becomes the template for the best episodes of ""M*A*S*H"" in the season to come.  The show was going to be able to make us cry as well as laugh, and in the end it was going to be the poignant moments that mattered more.  You watch this episode and you realize that M*A*S*H just became M*A*S*H.",1053907200,3,4151,4.717451523545706
