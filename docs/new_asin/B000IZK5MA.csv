2664390,4,B000IZK5MA,I like the fact that it shows 3 different woman in the 3 trimesters.  It shows you how to modify the poses if you are unable to do them or become uncomfortable.  It's definitely a good workout. It gets my heart going and the stretches are great! I was impressed.,1229040000,3,262,4.22
2664391,4,B000IZK5MA,"I am in my first trimester and I did prenatal yoga at a center throughout my previous pregnancy.

This video is easy to follow, with clear all-English instruction and modifications demonstrated. The instructor's voice is calm and soothing without being syrupy or new agey.

I didn't find it that challenging or interesting, however. I will probably need to mix it up with other videos throughout my pregnancy to stay interested in my practice.",1228867200,3,443,5.054794520547945
2664392,5,B000IZK5MA,"i really enjoyed this dvd.  for me it is the perfect and (most important) completely safe workout for pregnancy!

it is suitable for all levels and i love that the moves can be made more challenging with slight modifications.  it is a great way to keep fit/stretched and i love peaceful practice at the end of the workout, because i am so relaxed when it is over.",1178668800,3,363,4.388059701492537
2664393,5,B000IZK5MA,"I really enjoyed this prenatal yoga video.  The best part of it is that all of the poses and stretches are ""safe"" for any stage of your pregnancy and your level of your practice.  Mimi introduces modified downward dog and other modified inversions, so even if you are not an advanced practitioner you can still perform them, avoiding vena cava syndrome.  My favorite modification is the sun salutations towards the end of the ""flow"" section.  The ""strengthening"" section takes you through more core poses to help you relieve stress, relieve tight backs, and reach a calm state-of-mind in a gentle and calming way.  Another nice thing about Mimi's video is that throughout her practice she is narrating the class explaining the benefits of each pose.  Very enjoyable and great to do with other members of you family even if they are not pregnant =)",1177459200,11,847,4.847222222222222
2664394,4,B000IZK5MA,"This prenatal yoga video was enjoyable-they even had a cheesy thing at the end where there are pictures of babies floating out of the sky while twinkle twinkle little stars plays which my family enjoyed.

My favorite two sections were the flow section (basically floor and standing poses along with modified sun salutations) and the strengthening section.  I liked that you could choose chapters and it wasn't almost 2 hours long like some of the other videos.  It also didn't require any props.

This video isn't high on the difficulty rating but was enjoybale to do",1175472000,14,567,4.875
2664395,5,B000IZK5MA,"This video is excellent- it's not difficult to follow, you don't need alot of extra props, and it is enough of a workout that you feel the difference yet it is very gentle on the body. I've ordered other prenatal yoga videos but this is the one that I use the most.",1265068800,,265,4.115384615384615
2664396,1,B000IZK5MA,"I'd been doing beginner's yoga for about six months before I tried this video in my pregnancy. The instructor only instructs through a monotonous (not soothing) voice-over rather than talking to the camera every once in a while...or having any kind of inflection. The two women behind her in the video who are also doing the poses/stretches are pregnant so it is nice to see pregnant women doing the routine...but they don't seem to have great form so they are a little distracting. Overall the video is produced in a way that makes it monotonous, detached and just strange. It's the type of thing I would be embarrassed to be seen doing...and my other yoga videos aren't like that.",1264204800,,682,4.739495798319328
2664397,5,B000IZK5MA,"I bought this one and the Shiva Rea DVD. . .Mimi Solaire's is my favorite.  The workout has a nice flow, narration is easy to follow without looking at the TV, and the work out is well-rounded.  I feel great when I finish.",1253404800,,222,4.1395348837209305
2664398,5,B000IZK5MA,"I really like this DVD.  It's broken up into sections, so that you can do one or more parts if you are short on time/energy, but it flows really well from one section to another so the entire workout is great also (50 minutes, give or take).  The instructor is not pregnant, but she is accompanied by assistants in their 2nd and 3rd trimester, and they provide modifications when needed.  The instructor's voice-over is monotonous at first, but the more I do the workout, the more soothing it seems.  There is definitely a focus on stretching and good breathing exercises throughout, and just enough explanation without too much talking, so you can actually focus on the breathing and stretching.  I also feel like you stay in the poses/stretches long enough to really get the full benefit out of them.  Those more experienced with yoga may find it a little slow and boring, but at somewhere between the beginner and intermediate level, I really like the workout.",1252540800,,963,4.771084337349397
2664399,2,B000IZK5MA,"I took a chance on purchasing this pre-natal yogo DVD in hopes that it would provide a decent, low-impact workout.  I've done beginner's yoga for a few years and find it to be quite challenging, so I was hopeful about this workout.  Well, to be frank, it's quite boring.  Granted, there are a lot of great yoga positions that are not available to a pregnant woman, but this workout provided me with little more than a long, drawn-out, deep stretch.  So, if a great stretch is what you're looking for, than this is for you!  Otherwise, keep looking, and let me know what you find, please!",1252281600,4,587,4.5
2664400,4,B000IZK5MA,"I have been doing yoga for 10 years now and so when I found out I was pregnant I made the switch to pre-natal yoga. I tried two other DVDs before finding this one and this is the best so far. I find it to be a good workout. It is relaxing and yet still challenging. I like how if focuses on loosening up tight neck and shoulders that result from having to sleep on your side and best of all it really helps you focus on connecting with your baby. The ending is really cheesy and it's difficult to meditate to ""Twinkle, twinkle little star"" which is why I have it 4 rather then 5 stars.",1251331200,3,585,4.0085470085470085
2664401,4,B000IZK5MA,"This recording really strikes a good balance between a peaceful atmosphere and a straightforward method. The voiceover is fairly matter-of-fact, which could seem sort of cold, but I think with repeat use that's really MUCH better than a too-sweet, dreamy voice. (If I'm going to end up memorizing every word after using it a million times, I'd rather it be mostly descriptive.) And it does create a very mindful mood, regardless.
The structure is great, divided into real chapters so that you can skip around if you want. For my needs it's just the right amount of difficulty. I'm very out of practice at the moment, so it's still challenging, but she leaves plenty of room for making this as intense as you need it to be while still keeping it safe for pregnancy. In some places I don't feel the poses are held long enough, but then of course you can just hit pause and take it at your own pace.
One complaint: I found the ""Twinkle, Twinkle"" thing pretty annoying: it comes just as you're settling into a modified shavasana and are ready to relax. But it's easy enough to pause at that point, too.
Overall, highly recommended.",1237248000,6,1127,4.64
2664402,5,B000IZK5MA,"I just received this in the mail and finished the DVD. It is exactly what I wanted. Very soothing and calming. This is not a yoga work out DVD like Power yoga. It is very calm and I think well suited for beginners. I haven't practiced yoga for 5 years, but I could do this DVD.
I picked this DVD over the others listed because I did not want a work out, just relaxation and stretching. I highly recommend this to someone who wants the same",1236038400,2,439,4.116279069767442
2664403,5,B000IZK5MA,"I wasn't looking for an intense yoga work out, just one to help relieve back ache, stretch and just relax.  I got this one and the Shiva Rea video and I really like the Mimi Solaire one better.  I have used it through each trimester and the only thing I had real difficulty with is the child pose in the third trimester.

The voice is slightly monotonous but is good at explaining the poses.  And they do some extra things that you might not think of like rolling your ankles to help with swelling.  The Shiva Rea one does have a special section totally devoted to kegals if you forget to do them though...

I mainly did this video before work in the morning and noticeably felt better on days that I did it versus days I skipped.",1231545600,4,730,4.253623188405797
2664404,5,B000IZK5MA,"I have 4 pre-natal yoga DVD and I choose to do this one most of the time, my back is much better, it is really a pity that it is not as popular as the shiva rea pre-natal dvd, I found it after searching a researching a lot. For anyone looking for a gentle but very effective yoga practice I highly recommend this dvd.",1229040000,15,317,3.96875
8148081,5,B000IZK5MA,"Great yoga video! There were a few easy strengthening poses, but the focus seemed to be on safe and relaxing stretches for sore or tight back, hips, pelvis, legs, even ribs. I'm a yoga beginner, in my 28th week of pregnancy, and was experiencing significant pain in my ribs, pelvis,  and lower back. After 1 session, I felt relief! This is such a relaxing yoga session! Perfect for bedtime or any time u need to unwind!",1503705600,,419,4.5131578947368425
8148082,2,B000IZK5MA,"I was less than impressed with this course. The pacing was slow, with the exception of the sun salutation section, which was too fast paced (and abridged, as well). This video also lacks substantial flow or strengthening sections, and completely omits any of the warrior poses, or the pick-up exercises so common to pre-natal classes (such as 2-3 minute held cactus poses practiced to condition arms for baby holding and to put breath control into practice during build up of intensity).
Finally a note on aesthetics: I found the muzak background to be distracting and overly generic (like practicing yoga in a shopping mall), and the voice over narration nearly catatonic. I strongly suggest Desi Bartlett's course over this one.",1400716800,,730,5.091666666666667
8148083,4,B000IZK5MA,"I have been practicing yoga for a year prior to getting pregnant. I was too tired to do anything physical from 3-6 months, so I gave it up for a little bit. Now that I am at 6 mo, this is just what I needed. The sun salutation portion was a bit more physical than I was used to, but I think that with a few more times doing this video, I'll not get so winded. Great positions for my popping belly too. Overall, I enjoy the workout.",1362182400,,431,3.909090909090909
8148084,1,B000IZK5MA,for my pregnant wife put it on the iPad and tried to watch it on the big tv By mirroring it though apple tv and the the stuoid thing won't play if I have the wifi turned on on the iPad so intern I can not watch it on the TV unless I use the computer WTF,1359417600,,253,3.456140350877193
8148085,2,B000IZK5MA,"I have bad hips and back and was looking forward to the 3rd trimester momma doing the modifications so I could keep up. She stops doing the modifications after the first session and so I couldn't go any farther. The hip exercises were way too hard and as soon as I got my leg into the correct position they moved onto quick rest and the next position before I could catch up. Also the dvd was mirror image so it looked like the ladies were using their right arms but the voice over said left, if I wasn't listening closely I got very confused.",1358294400,,543,4.230769230769231
8148086,5,B000IZK5MA,"This video is great! I am 4 weeks pregnant now, but have been using it for a few weeks now to get in a good, healthy rhythm for pregnancy.
I would purchase this again and would purchase it for a friend.  Great for beginners. No props required. Lots of connecting to baby moments, which I love. Easy to follow, Mimi's voice is very soothing and she instructs at a good pace that gives you time to move to the next position.
Only thing I noticed was that several times she instructs to count 5 breaths and I'm usually only able to get in 3 by the time she moves on to another pose. Still a worth while purchase and now that I have it on my video playlist I can take it with me anywhere I go!",1346976000,,689,4.029197080291971
8148087,3,B000IZK5MA,"This work out is pretty relaxing, it isn't too hard or strenuous. My muscles and joints feel much better after I'm through.  But, I feel like there are a few flaws with the workout.  There are some miscues that are confusing, where the verbal instructions don't match up with the movements.  Also, it seems to me that its backwards.  I am used to mirroring the movements I see on the screen, but you have to reverse it.  I have only practiced yoga in a studio so I have no idea if this is normal for this format.  It is a big distraction for me. There are some poses that feel like they allow more time on one side than the other. The music is kind of dated too.  At the end there is a really strange musical accompaniment to shavasana with even more annoying music and pictures of babies floating through the sky.  Not relaxing at all.  I usually just skip it.  Otherwise, its nice to see normal looking pregnant people, modestly dressed, and they offer several variations of the poses, which is nice.  All and all, I was hoping for something better.  I really wanted to like it but I find that I don't ever look forward to doing this workout.  It just doesn't seem very polished, like it was hastily thrown together.",1339632000,3,1218,4.383928571428571
8148088,5,B000IZK5MA,This workout video was so great for me especially during the last 2 trimesters of pregnancy.  Mimi is very soothing and inspirational.  The stretches are not to difficult and are sensitive to the changing pregnancy body.  She encourages you to relax if you get tired.  I used the breathing exercises during labor and during a cephalic version (the doctor turned the baby because he was breeched).  The breathing exercises really helped me to manage the pain during labor and the turning procedure.  I feel that doing the exercises after the cephalic version helped the baby stay in the right position for labor.  I also enjoyed the end of the video when I was able to bond with my baby.  This was my first experience with yoga.  I really liked the stretching and always felt relaxed and refreshed after working out.,1320278400,,815,4.764285714285714
8148089,3,B000IZK5MA,"I've been doing yoga for over 14 years, have done pre-natal yoga during both my pregnancies, and I think some poses on this DVD are a bit much for pregnancy, especially if you're in your last trimester. There is nothing inherently bad about Mimi's instruction or the form of the 2 ladies in the video (who do show adjustments to some of the poses, btw). It's just that if you prefer to hold poses instead of flowing, or if you are looking for something to relax, stretch, and more subtly strengthen instead of something to make you feel you've had a ""workout,"" then you might choose another DVD. There is an entire section of this DVD that I skip b/c I find it to be too much of a workout, and many poses in the other sections (like pigeon pose), I find too challenging for my pregnant body. The relaxation section is really good and soothing, though. As I've said, I have done lots of yoga, but prefer yoga that's not so vigorous during pregnancy and generally prefer yoga that focuses more on form, breath, and relaxation over yoga that seems geared toward working out or ""shaping up."" If you enjoy a yoga workout or a challenge during pregnancy, though, or if you did hot yoga, power yoga, or lots of intermediate yoga classes before pregnancy, this might be the pregnancy DVD for you--or maybe the Shiva Rhea one, which is also a bit of a challenge.",1316476800,,1353,4.481781376518219
8148090,4,B000IZK5MA,"This was my first yoga experience. I really enjoy the workout, and it is an easy to follow video. I love that is doesn't require any additional equipment and that it is much shorter than other prenatal videos I looked at.",1299542400,,221,4.414634146341464
