8614952,5,B00FEOM2G2,"Cute cult film mixing horror and martial arts from the mid 70's. Unfortunately some of the fight choreography leaves a lot to be desired as there are some top level karate men such as Wifredo Roldan in the film but their skills are not properly showcased as a result. This is not a great martial arts film by any standard. However, if you are from NYC and were/are involved in the New York City kararte scene today you will get to see a few of the 'names' from back in the day perform.",1425168000,,485,4.225806451612903

8614954,3,B00FEOM2G2,A sacred amulet is stolen by a kung fu student on a trip to the far east. A demon who was buried in 200 B.C. emerges in a three piece suit and follows the thief back to New York where he hides in the subway system and naturally starts killing people. There are A LOT of kung fu sequences which basically are filler until the final showdown. Too much kung fu for my tastes.,1391472000,,372,4.04054054054054
