8088555,4,B000BL5I7I,"I haven't tried the Power Yoga for Runners yet, but I can say that the Hard-Body Yoga video is great.  This video is perfect for people who lack flexibility and/or are new to yoga.  You will notice a significant improvement in muscle tone within a couple of weeks and once you memorize the moves you'll be able to do the workout on your own.  It's also a great tape because she offers modifications and advanced techniques so you'll be continually challenging yourself.  Criticisms: there aren't enough breathing cues and the tempo is off on some of the moves.  Overall, definitely worth buying.",1137456000,5,595,4.794117647058823
