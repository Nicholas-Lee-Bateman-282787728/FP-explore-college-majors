8192098,5,B000PKG8XI,"This movie brings back old memories. I remember watching this when i was a senior in high school. Great storyline from back in the day when movies and tv shows were actually made with quality in mind rather than the mindless drivel they are made with today. Excellent acting , drama and a little comedy thrown into the mix. and a great moral to the story as well.",1391385600,,363,4.352941176470588
8192099,5,B000PKG8XI,"The movie itself is trite, silly, and at times offensive, but it was filmed on location all over NYC in the summer of 1981 and for that alone is worth watching. The subplot of the teen being seduced by an older man- but only goes as far as 'holding' (and then panics that he might be gay, but the movie goes to great pains to assure us he's not) is typical for its time.

Oddly unbilled on the cover is Broadway's Liz Callaway, who sings several songs and knocks them out of the park.",1376006400,2,484,4.148936170212766
