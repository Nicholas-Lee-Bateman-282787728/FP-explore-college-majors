8558442,4,B00AWJ44TW,"A solid, well-researched documentary combining classic film clips and ample footage of Mr. Wise's appearance at a classic horror convention known as FANEX many years ago. Certainly worth looking into for Robert Wise fans or for classic movie fans in general, as Mr. Wise had a hand in many a classic movie across a wide array of genres.",1454198400,,336,4.810344827586207
8558443,2,B00AWJ44TW,"When I saw the cover packaging for this DVD I was a bit concerned. It looked like the kind of ""budget"" film you find in the bargain bin at Best Buy. But the copyright date was 2013 so I thought it might be worth watching. When I put the DVD in my player there was the option of watching the film or looking at other trailers from the same company. These were schlocky horror films. This was not a good omen but I trudged on.

The 100-minute  ""documentary"" revolves around an  undated interview with the great director Robert Wise, who began his career as a film editor for Orson Welles (and did that work on ""Citizen Kane"" and ""The Magnificent Ambersons""), during his last years. This footage is blended with clips from his films but most (if not all) come from the ""Trailers"" for these films and they are often in poor condition. Add to the fact that at various points the screen image becomes jumpy and this DVd becomes a chore to watch, despite the fact that Wise's comments - the only reason to watch it - are interesting.

Further research revealed that this documentary may have  once been  released on Laser Disc (though it does not appear in iMDB)  though there is no indication here.

So I can only recommend this to the true die-hard film fan who wants to hear the legendary director reminisce on his life and is willing to struggle through poor film clips (never put into perspective- the actors are not identified) and jumpy images.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8558444,2,B00AWJ44TW,"Robert Wise had been one of my most favorite directors, so on viewing this documentary I was truly disappointed in its content.

It is transferred to DVD from a longtime ago Laser Disc, with 2012 credits top and tail of the program.  It was originally 4x3, but now enhanced for widescreen that looks very 1980s.

Bob Wise's Q&A is difficult to hear at times because people in the audience cough or splutter and that is louder than his dialogue.  There are many clips of his films, (some scenes, but mostly trailers) but several are of dubious quality.  'The Sound of Music' only rates about a 15 second clip.

No, I would not recommend this to anyone.",1363392000,5,651,4.568965517241379
