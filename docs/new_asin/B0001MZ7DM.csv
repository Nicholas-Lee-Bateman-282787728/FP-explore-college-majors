8014853,4,B0001MZ7DM,A little different than what I was expecting. Some action and then some slow spots. The drawing is really good though. Good for starters.,1419638400,,137,4.75
8014854,5,B0001MZ7DM,"Kiddy Grade volume 3 is the best disc yet it has some of the best episodes. Some of the coolest ES members appear in these episodes also like Viola and Cesario,and Tweedledee and Tweedledum. The show just keeps getting better and better. If you liked the first two discs then you'll love this one. Anyone who has not watched this show is weird it is so good. If you have not seen it give it a try you will not be let down I promise. If you haven't boughten this disc yet then go to the store and get it.",1084838400,,503,4.04
