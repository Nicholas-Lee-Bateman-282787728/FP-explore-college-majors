8215336,5,B000UWJ48C,"This is a great little addition to any space buff's personal library or collection. It is a single video segment, in color that covers the year 1963 at the cape. The DVD self starts and self replays. It has rare footage of the ASSET vehicle and POLARIS launches as well as one really cool snipet of the Titan IIIC and it's launch Complex in model form. It is an un-improved transfer from film, but is still pretty good viewing. The End is an elongated JFK's final visit segment, but it is well in context and not out of place. This was worth the money as most of the footage is stuff I've not seen before and I have all of the Spacecraft Films DVDs and all of the NASA DVDs.",1221264000,2,674,4.1923076923076925
8215337,3,B000UWJ48C,"The cover of this DVD is somewhat misleading.  I was hoping it would be a sort of video tour of the Cape at the time of the Mercury program (1963).  What this DVD contains is a roughly 25 minute Air Force promotional film shot around that time, and it comes complete with all the charm you would expect from a government produced film of that time (i.e. not much).  It does at least have some good archival video of the Cape and the Mercury program that I'd never seen before though, so if that hooks your interest then give it a shot.",1200528000,3,535,4.2254901960784315
