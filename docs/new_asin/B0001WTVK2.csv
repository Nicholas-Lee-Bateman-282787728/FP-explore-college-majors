8017085,3,B0001WTVK2,"To explain how I am rating this movie, I am rating it based on an internal continuum of bad movies, with three stars somehow being the worst. Pocket Ninjas fails in almost every aspect as a film. Even the box flagrantly lies to you: I don't know who those children on the cover are, but they are NOT the titular Pocket Ninjas, nor do the Pocket Ninjas ever fight using common household items, nor are they, in point of fact, under four feet, though you may be able to make a case for their fierceness.

The so-called plot is almost completely incomprehensible. Frequently, scenes seem to be randomly inserted and then they are explained away as being a part of the ""comic book"" that the kids are maybe reading, or maybe a part of, or maybe nothing is in the comic book but you just think it is because someone occasionally makes a comment about a comic book while holding a comic book right after a scene where something pointless has happened.

The 78 minute run time is more heavily padded than a busty drag-queen in a swim-suit competition, though admittedly, much less skillfully.  Pointless training montages (in which there never seems to be any improvement, nor does there seem to be any shame in reusing footage from a previous training montage that you just watched five minutes ago) are featured prominently, almost as though someone said, hey, do you think you could make a movie entirely out of training montages? and someone else said, well, probably not ENTIRELY and the real filler material in the film is the plot.

The one final thing that is worth mentioning is that this movie made me feel bad for Robert ZDar, which I didn't think was possible. The only thing I could compare it to would be if Meryl Streep were reduced to tap dancing on a street corner with no pants on for nickels. Thats how degrading it is to appear in Pocket Ninjas for Robert ZDar.

Overall, this movie is probably not worth your time. Its not a funny-bad movie, or even a movie where you can potentially riff your way though it happily. Its just torture, plain and simple.",1454457600,,2065,4.57027027027027
8017086,5,B0001WTVK2,The movie was delivered in good stable condition although I wish it was lost in the mail because it is the worst movie ever made.,1448668800,,129,4.2
8017087,1,B0001WTVK2,"This is the most baffling hodgepodge of scenes I've ever seen. Acting is non-existent, storyline comes and goes, and it's frankly an embarrassment.

That being said, this is a fantastic movie to laugh at for its incompetency. I honestly feel bad for those who made this moving picture display because it's clear the producers were confused.

Buy it if you want a good laugh or a white elephant gift.",1406419200,,399,4.768115942028985
8017088,1,B0001WTVK2,"As a collector of DVD's I would occasionally pick up something that isn't worthy to be in my collection.  But, I won't let this one mess up my day.  I'll review it here so you don't get trapped buying it when you see it on a store shelf.

  First, what do Gary Boatner, Paul Bacca and David J. Stevens have in common?  They are the hacks who supposedly did the work on the sound for this movie.  The music score was from one keyboard and it sounded as though they plugged the headphone jack into the tape jack of the mixer, turned it up to maximum volume and commenced to record with the resulting fried circuits.  The dialog on the other hand sounded like it was all recorded separately on an Ediphone.

 Then comes the plot.  It's not a Ninja comedy as advertised.  The best and most accurate plot description is as a very thinly disguised environmentalist propaganda message.  This is the very same stuff those cheezy middle school ""educational movies"" are made of.  In fact, this is where the movie truely belongs, flickering on the screen from an 8mm reel in middle school while a gym teacher asks rehearsed questions from a little instruction booklet included with it so he can pretend he knows everything.

 Out of a possible score of 100, I'd give it a 3.  The three points are for the absurd fight scenes.  Weirdness has an appeal with me.  As for any authenticity in the fight scenes, it's safe to bet that Miss Piggy did a better job in ""The Muppet Movie"".

 All in all, I've seen better movies done by drunks with cell phone cameras.

Rated ""S"" for STUPID

 I'm going to the dumpster now.  Gotta toss out a DVD.",1308873600,2,1623,4.420338983050847
8017089,5,B0001WTVK2,"The film was supposed to be a kids film directed by Donald Jackson but after 4 days of shooting almost nothing, and where he brought hookers to the set the same night as the finacials backers were on the set, he was quickly fired. The production sat for a few weeks when the original camerman was sent out to direct and shoot footage of a local Asian dragon festival. He brought back shaky, amature footge so he too was fired (His attitude of ""If I got paid more I would do better work"" didn't seem to sell the executive producer on keeping him on) The line producer was then sent out to direct a sunset shot at the beach with a new cameraman. While the footage looked good, there was little direction. The editor was asked to somehow tie all this foortage together in some sort of story. Some new scenes were written to try and explain what was going on however after the bulk of that footage was shot the executive producer decided to direct some scenes that had no connection to anything new or old (Clowns in the Ballon factory, Virtual Reality fights, Wizard of Oz scene) to add ""production Value"". The film was finished however while at the film market no one would buy a film that was under 90 minutes so the exeutive producer made the editor shoot 10 minutes of work out scenes.

 The editor did as good of a job as could be expected with the various looks and storylines. If one reads the end credits and you took each section  andlooked at it on it's own one could see that the original Donald Jackson ""Skate Dragons"" footage is by far the worst looking and worst directed part. The Clowns in the Ballon factory scenes looks good and is silly but really has no place in the film, the Virtual Reality fights are out of place even by the 80 standards (Come on 'Tron' and 'The Black Hole' looked better than this), The Donald Jackson fight scenes with Robert Z'Dar and Gary Daniels are so poorly shot and directed that Gary Daniels went home and cut his hair off the next day so he would not have to work on the film any more. (Supposedly new scenes were written for him and his short hair look where he was a co-anchor on a news show with the female lead - thusly the romantic subtext - and the news about toxic dumping however the executive producer cut those scenes suggesting that Gary Daniles was an action star and no one would ever want to see him talk, just fight.)",1214524800,,2380,4.3558558558558556
8017090,1,B0001WTVK2,"I bought this DVD for a friend who is a Robert Z'Dar completeist. I was morbidly curious, so I watched it first. That was a major lapse of judgment. My first challenge was in trying to play the DVD: the main menu is so poorly designed as to make it hard to figure out how to get the movie to start; unfortunately I was a bit too tenacious and actually was able to get the film to play.

This film is one of the most amateurish films ever made (I am not the first reviewer to notice this,) making such Mogadore, Ohio classics as ""Chickboxer"" and ""Galaxy of the Dinosaurs"" look like Oscar winners by comparison. The movie stars a long haired karate instructor (think Roger Daltry in a bathrobe) and three annoying kids. This concept was far more skillfully executed by Hulk Hogan in ""3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain."" I am somewhat ashamed to be able to thoughtfully compare the two.

The teacher is the ""White Dragon"" who patrols the streets of gang-infested Los Angeles by night. He has supernatural powers (the ""gift of the dragon"") which he passes along to his three young proteges, who get red, gold, and black dragon masks of their own. (When you see the Red Dragon, note how he looks like an almost perfect cross between Gene Simmons in costume and Boy George.) The enemy is Cobra Khan played by Robert Z'Dar, who along with his son, Cubby Khan, run the looting and pillaging gangs.

The kids adore their teacher, and they practice with him daily. In fact, the huge preponderance of the film is taken up by karate practice (they wish they were as good as the cast of ""Chickboxer"" but they aren't) and annoying electronic music. Not only are they small ninjas (hence the title,) they rollerblade to their fights. There are subplots about environmental damage and fish poisonings, a comic book written in ""Canadian"" instead of English (rendering it illegible to the ninjas,) and fantasy action vignettes in which Robert Z'Dar actually gets to play patty cake and do a Tarzan impression that frightens off clowns. (I am not making this up.) Of all subplots, though, the most disconcerting is the one in which the moody ninja's mom is romantically interested in the karate teacher. When she bakes him cookies there are voiceovers where we get to explore what they are thinking about each other. Samples include ""Nice muscles"" and ""Her hair is like a waterfall gleaming in the moonlight."" That's not too far off, actually: her hair is quite large.

Cubby Khan and his minions finally duke it out in a warehouse, and engage the ninjas in a virtual reality game to determine the winner. This is perhaps the worst few minutes of film I have ever sat through in my entire life. Between the ""Sonic Virtual Reality"" special effects and Robert Z'Dar being enveloped in silly string, very little else compares to this in wretchedness.

One thing to note as the film ends: absolutely no plots are resolved. None. This film is notable for its utter lack of resolution. Are the gang problems solved? Do the karate teacher and the ninja's mom hook up? Is the fish poisoning stopped? We have no idea (and we don't care.) That shouldn't really be a problem for the target audience of this film, but even children will be unentertained by this drivel. This is not so bad it's good, it's just bad. If you want to see a better performance by Robert Z'Dar, I recommend ""Guns of El Chupacabra,"" which, while awful, is still better than this. Actually I would recommend any of Robert Z'Dar's movies in preference to this, now that I think about it.

8017093,2,B0001WTVK2,"Hi there.

Do you like movies with incredibly bad acting?
Do you enjoy watching a movie thats cut together so bad you could swear your 3 year old kid could film something better?
Do you like watching actors run into a room and stand perfectly still while they say there dialog?
Do you like incredibly boring long montages every 5 minutes?
Do you want to see a familly comedy movie that is in no way at all funny?
Do you want to watch a beautiful young girl with only one name who amazingly had no acting career after this film and seems to have disapeered off the face of this earth?
Do you wanna see Maniac Cop have the stupidest showdown in history while balancing on balloons and shaming the 3 stooges?
Do you have an I.Q under 0.1?

Then this movie is perfect for you.

8017094,5,B0001WTVK2,"Dave Eddy has crafted one of the most intense ninja movies I have ever seen. The fight scenes were brutal and realistic, to the point where I almost shut it off so I wouldn't get nightmares, just too much gore. Other than that it was a fine film with AWESOME editing, great directing and spectacular acting (especially the hot austrailian teacher and Big Jaw) as far as the fight choreography goes, p*** off Jackie Chan, Dave Eddy is the new king! The movie is practically flawless, I dare you to find a continuity error. The fight scene involving the balloons was highly clever, inventine and INTENSE!!!! If you haven't seen what's quite possibly the best movie with ninja in its title (sorry American Ninja) then you must buy it now. Not for the squeemish or unintelligent. Treat yourself to the best action film since Last Action Hero and buy  Pocket Ninjas now!",1097971200,4,865,4.690789473684211
