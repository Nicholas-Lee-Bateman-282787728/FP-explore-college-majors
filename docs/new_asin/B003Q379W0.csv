8493676,3,B003Q379W0,"I really really wanted to like this video. I'm heading back to Raja Ampat next month and thought this would be a good to watch before the trip. . There is very little information on this remote location available to those planning travel so if you have never been to this part of the world this MAY provide you with rudimentary information. I've been diving most areas of Raja Ampat and this video did not provide any new information for me. While I can certainly appreciate the passion the author/narrator has for diving, this video looks like vacation footage. Be aware, everything presented is available by simply searching for ""raja ampat"" on the internet. Use a reliable tour operator to help you plan your trip and to ensure you are not only well informed about the beauty of this place (it is truly unlike anywhere else) but the challenges one should be prepared for (see below). Raja Ampat has spectacular history, culture and natural beauty...you will only scratch the surface with this video.

My review is broken down into several categories:

Envrionmental Awareness: There are two scenes which made me cringe: one scene with a diver standing on coral and one in which the diver is upside down walking on the ceiling of an underwater cave. Granted the author cannot control the behavior of others. BUT, it is inexcusable to include this footage, much less for the dive operation to tolerate this behavior AT ALL for any diver at any time.

Cultural and Historical Information: All interviews are conducted with the foreign dive boat operator staff and pearl farm owner. No interviews are conducted with the local Indonesian staff. No real cultural information is presented. The narrator mispronounces the word ""Bali"" twice in this video. Much of the music used in this video seems so out of place: Spanish flamenco and other non-Indonesian music. Only a few Indonesian songs were used. Overall the music used did not transport you mentally to Indonesia, but maybe to Spain instead. No information is presented on the conservation and local education efforts or the marine park/diver Tag sfee that each visiting diver has paid isince 2007.

Story Line: There is little structure to the content of the video, scenes are presented without context. It is only when you get to the end credits that you see the names of the dive sites visited. The only clear line here is that the author is trying to sell you on traveling to Raja Ampat and to go diving on the Ocean Rover dive boat. Even so, he only shows you the exterior of the boat.

Videography: The colors were ""off"" in many underwater scenes due to improper white balance. Backscatter could have been reduced by shooting with natural light and color correction filter. If you pay attention during the filming of close by animals you will notice a singular theme: Approach Animal, animal flees. The result is a picture of the animals' backside. The editing of this video is loose. Some scenes are repeated over and over again...do we really need to see the electric file clam twice? multiple shots of clownfish? Or, do we need to see the Flambouyant Cuttlefish walk on the sand twice? Multiple scenes of marching children? After a while it became repetitive. Better editing, shorter scenes and less topside staged interviews would better hold my attention.

Video format: This video only played in one out of three of my DVD players. Make sure yours can play Blue Ray.

Species Information: The author indicates the common names of a few selected creatures, but that is not consistently done. There is no information on the habitats in which these creatures are found or in what type of diving conditions.

Diving: Current is mentioned a few times in the video, but no real information beyond that. Raja Ampat can have strong currents! The water can be cooler than other tropical locations. Are there bommies? Are there wall dives? Are there muck dives? Are there mangrove dives? You don't get answers to these questions in this video. (Answer: Yes, to all).

Safety: There is minimal information on diving practices, the lack of a chamber in Raja Ampat, the need to carry insurance or be prepared for the possiblity of malaria, gastric problems etc. No emphasis on the flight schedules in and out of Sorong or the possible delay in medical aid. There is no mention that this dive location is best for moderatly active to advanced divers.

I gave this video a generous three stars because it is one of the only ones out there. If there were more choices my rating would likely be lower.",1321660800,2,4548,4.8117797695262485
