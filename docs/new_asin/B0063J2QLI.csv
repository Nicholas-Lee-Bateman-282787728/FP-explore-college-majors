8492088,3,B0063J2QLI,I bought these seven movies because I love Sean Penn and wanted 'At Close Range'. They had an A and B side for 'Dead Man Walking' and no 'At Close Range'! So so sad...,1518566400,2,167,3.9411764705882355

8492091,5,B0063J2QLI,"If you are a Sean Penn fan it is a must have. Nice quality packaging. At Close Range in wide screen format. Indian Runner IMO best drama ever made. Wish it included The Pledge shocking it didn't, but all in all great value, and great movies. Also the seller I got it from did a great job. 5 stars. And they are all individual disks in a hard clam shell case.",1334188800,3,358,4.056338028169014
