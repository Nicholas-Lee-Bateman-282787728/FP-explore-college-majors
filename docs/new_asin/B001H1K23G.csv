8307639,2,B001H1K23G,"I have to say having considered Uzak one of the best films I have ever seen and being equally impressed with ""Climates"" (As painful to watch as it was) I was greatly disappointed with this film.

There are 2 stories to this film and 2 CD's. The first one is almost a prequel to the film Uzak concerning the small town which Mahmut originally came from. The problem with this film is its far too concerned with flowery dialogue and not so with character. The director seems to have to an extent lost his way and forgotten that what made Uzak such a masterpiece is that he minimized such flowery dialogue (All too common with Turkish films) and allowed the characters to speak for themselves so you had one scene where the family were in the country together having a BBQ which lasted for most of the film. Lots of boring chat about going to America, the 1st World War (Got a bit confused with this one to be honest, just how old was the director suggesting grandad was???) and general life in the small town. The big problem was they were a middle class land owning town dwelling family sitting around moaning, there was little to either sympathise or even be interested in.

The second part is Yusuf going back to the small town doing a bit of film directing while he is there (And giving Mahmut a bit of part time work in the process) Again this becomes laborious to watch and frankly in a short space of time you just loose interest.

All in all I was very disappointed with this film, maybe I just looked forward to it too much and was expecting too much from it.",1248048000,,1566,4.374570446735395
