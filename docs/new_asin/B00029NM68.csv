it is what it is, a really good example of what a movie is when
you really love looking at naked men.  the plot dosen't matter.
the bodys are all that matters, and there are some good ones in this",1226534400,3,224,3.9555555555555557
8024511,1,B00029NM68,"Complete and utter trash.  But it provided me with an opportunity to see what a DVD does when you put it in the microwave!

The acting is really pretty awful - almost something you would expect to find in a cheap porn film.  The plot is flimsy, predictable and uninteresting and the filmography is very poor.

I am no expert however on other people's likes and dislikes.  I personally can stand a poorly made film if there is something about it that takes my interest.  I struggled, but found nothing to redeem this offering.  In fact - I have never seen it right through and that's a first for me.

Sorry folks - I really cannot say that this one is worth the money!",1108252800,8,667,4.32258064516129
8024512,2,B00029NM68,"I purchased this DVD because the cover looked as if this was going to be a cute gay romantic comedy. I guess that old saying is true... don't judge a book by it's cover! Or in this case a DVD! The ""film"" was shot on digital video which gives it a very cheap look. The DVD is presented in a 16 x 9 Widescreen format which doesn't add much. One of the special features on this disc is the actor's audition tapes. While all of the young men involved are quite handsome there are varying degrees of acting talent all are quite evident in their auditions. Many of which improve by the time of filming however, many do not! The most obvious is Mike Angel who I almost felt sorry for in his audtion. It looked as if Mr. Angel were being held at gunpoint! His performance is just plain bad! And I'm not talking Patty Duke in ""Valley Of The Dolls"" so bad it's good, bad! I mean bad! In the audition reel there was an actor named Jack London who gave the best audition of all! Mr. London was everything an actor should be in an audition, confident without being cocky, charming, vocally strong, animated and the most physically gifted, if you know what I mean! I was quite disappointed by the fact that London only has a minor featured role! The story revolves around a support group of men who all are striving to overcome their perceived sexual disfunctions. Throughout the film director Thomas R. Smyth makes sure all of the men are shown in various states of undress with the exception of actor/producer Joseph Dain who stays modestly covered through the proceedings. Another disappointment!
 It seems to me that this film could have been so much more, perhaps a gay romantic comedy! What we have here is the plot of a hardcore porn minus the sex! I've actually seen better acting and for that matter better film making in hardcore! If you like to see beautiful young men posing in the nude in a film with a feather weight plot then ""Group Therapy"" is for you! Also worth mentioning are Mitch Biggs, Harry Johnson & Colton Matthews who are all very charming despite their wooden dialogue. And might I add very easy on the eyes!",1091491200,25,2121,4.4524421593830334
