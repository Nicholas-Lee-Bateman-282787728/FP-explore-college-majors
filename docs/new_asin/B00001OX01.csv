1245967,1,B00001OX01,I would encourage anyone who is truly interested in the truth to attend an event personally before listening to the bitter resentment of people who feel they have been conned out of something. Make whatever choices you feel- but I at least want people to have the same chance as I did to make a personal decision. The organisation is non profit and you will not be asked or even encouraged to do anything other than listen to his message and ask questions if you wish,1108512000,40,467,4.441860465116279

The organizations that support Maharaji's work are not controlled by him and do not provide financial support for him.  Nothing about him or his work fits the definition of a ""cult"".
Only juveniles with little or no imagination would find this film interesting.

1245969,5,B00001OX01,"Last night we watched the documentary ""Lord of the Universe."" The 60-minute black and white video examined the planning and execution of the 1973 Millenium Festival honoring infamous cult-leader Prem Rawat, aka Guru Maharaji. The reporters use handheld cameras and body packs to record intimate conversations with many types of people; from doubters, like Abbie Hoffman, to aspirants, to premies, to proponents, like Rennie Davis. It was an extraordinarily interesting video, and well worth the time.
One scene stands out in my mind. A young Prem Rawat, who still regards himself as a living God and now directs both the current cult Elan Vital and its sham, non-profit offspring ""The Prem Rawat Foundation,"" lands at Houston International Airport. Guru Maharaji gives a short speech to his devotees near the runway, on a platform stage. He wears garlands of flowers during his brief lecture, and, standing up to leave, he heaves the hefty amount of garlands to one of his security officers, who remains onstage, and exits.
Moments after ""The Lord of the Universe"" has departed, the remaining security man breaks apart the garlands, handing bits and pieces to clamoring devotees. The camera zooms in on the pleading, outstretched hands begging for small bits of flower. When lucky devotees receive some manna, the bearers run to the back of the crowd, laughing ecstatically, holding the flower afixed directly below their noses. The fact that, seconds earlier, these flowers were touched by the living body of God, induces the flower-snarfers to be transported into a crazed state of bliss. All this is deftly captured in the documentary.
In one short sequence, the screen reveals how two girls, presumably friends, joyously laugh and giggle, nearly falling to the ground, due to their happiness in receiving a flower worn by Maharaji. As the laughing girls buckle, gleefully inebriated with their fortune, a lone, teenaged boy lurking in the background, who also received a god-touched flower, walks closer, holding the flower afixed to his nose. Keeping himself at a safe distance from the girls while clutching his own bounty, he glances and smiles approvingly toward the girls, indicating he shares and understands their mutual, newfound advantage. Meanwhile, throngs of other devotees have not received flowers, and their wails of desperation and misery are overheard on the soundtrack.
Among other successes, this documentary successfully juxtaposes the duality of the flower sniffers' religious rapture amid the flowerless followers' wails of suffering. The scene shows how, in the context of a cult, some lucky followers become privileged with a deserved or undeserved honor, while their equals unexplainably do not. The disadvantaged are then ostracized precisely because of their misfortune. Oddly, there was no evidence exemplifying the notion of sharing the god-touched flowers equally amongst the cult members attending this event. Granted, had the devotees offered to share their god-touched flowers with the have-nots, it would still not have appeared as anything less than eccentric cult behavior. All the same, privileged followers in no way shared their bounty with the less fortunate, preferring, instead, to ecstatically commune with their precious flower amongst other advantaged premies, in plain view of the painfully disadvantaged.
In a similar vein, the video addresses this duality in the context of receiving Knowledge. The videographers interview ex-premies, who convey that some individuals are selected for initiation, some are not. By weeding out the crowds before and during the Knowledge session, ex-cult members contend that Maharaji's organization artificially increases the aspirants' desire to become initiated. As Mahatmas purposely pluck the rejects from the room, the remaining inductees' need for belonging becomes bolstered, and their intensive belief in Maharaji becomes rigidified.
By privileging some and not others, the cult creates its own artificial mystique. While some followers reach levels of ecstasy heretofore unknown, others are cast into an ocean of misery and despair. Indeed, the documentary depicts how the cult was planting the seeds of its own demise, even in the early years, by invoking the tools of deception, fraud, and unfair advantage, for the sole aim of self-propagation.
This documentary exemplifies excellent journalistic skills while exposing the high crimes of an unholy family.",1052870400,21,4451,5.4803493449781655
1245970,5,B00001OX01,"This video offers a brief look into the world of a cult.  Its members, mostly stoned out hippies left over from the 60's, are shown preparing for the Millennium Event at the Houston Astrodome.  Its leader, a young Indian chap with chubby cheeks and a fingernails-scratching-across-a-blackboard voice, dressed in Hari Krishna garb, is interviewed and offers a plateful of jibberish that makes no sense to lay people.  His followers, known as Premies, believe he is the Lord of the Universe, GOD incarnate in flesh.  They even go so far as to kiss his feet.  He eventually gets a pie thrown in his face at one event, where he is now wearing a three-piece suit.  The thrower of the pie is eventually beaten, almost to death, by some of the guru's goons (Fakirinand and others).  I thought it was a movie at first, sort of like the Blair Witch Project, but soon learned it was a documentary of an ACTUAL EVENT, which took place here in America.
My research on the topic revealed that this Guru is still operating in America and around the world.  He owns a Gulfstream V Jet, which costs around 30 million dollars and a 106-foot yacht, which cost a mere 6.5 million dollars.  He owns a palatial estate in Malibu, Ca. and other homes around the world.
The movie is worth buying for the humour and underlying social comment about the mindset in the early 70's, at the height of the Drug Culture.",978566400,20,1388,4.587044534412955
1245971,5,B00001OX01,"If this document hadn't turned-up on the market almost three decades later, memories of the event would have been altered and, some day, lost.  It already surpasses imagination.
For anyone foreign to the era and  phenomenon, it gives a great insight into a cult. Chances are historians,  sociologists, philosophers and theologians will benefit from seeing it.  Thesis are to be written on this fringe which once pretended to  mainstream.
Chances are, as the story unfolds, this cult will return into  the spotlight. Skeletons pop-out of the woodwork everyday now and front  page stories will, one day, stop being wasted. I see a great potential for  a 6 hours mini-series where footage from this document will be worth a  fortune. Who owns the rights?",967593600,12,751,5.040650406504065
1245972,5,B00001OX01,"As I was there in the Astrodome for this ""program"" I really enjoyed viewing this excellent and incisive film.  I laughed and cried, cringed and burned as I felt the full extent of the painful realization  that I had indeed been duped by the fraud of the universe, Prem Rawat.
My  favorite parts of the film include Abby Hoffman's ascerbic and accurate  remark at the end, seeing the ""GOD"" sign behind Maharaji's throne  and the devotee at the end saying he'd like to ""slit the throat""  of the reporter who ""pied"" Maharaji in Detroit.  (The reporter  was almost killed by Mahatma Fakiranand, one of Maharaji's henchmen in the  cult, and ended up with brain damage from being struck in the head with a  hammer.)

After all, it's all just a bit of fun,  eh?
 The two brothers fought over the coffers of the cult a couple of  months after the 1973 Houston event and haven't talked since.  The dour  mother in the video, Mata Ji, sided with Satpal and never reconciled with  junior before her death.  The ridiculous Las Vegas act brother, who we  worshipped then as the Lord of Music is in India, I think, also with  Satpal.

7914606,4,B00001OX01,"I First heard about this video on the Ex-Premie website. I was drawn to it out of morbid curiosity but not enough to pay to watch it. Now with the thanks of a free trial of Amazon Realeyz I have finally got to see the documentary.
It gives a snapshot of the 1970's and the cult around Maharaji. There are some very interesting interviews and we get to see a clash of cultures that are hard to imagine in this more globalist day and age.
As a lifelong follower of Maharaji or Prem Rawat as he now prefers to be known I saw a very sad angle to this documentary. While there is debate of whether the boy-guru is the son of god or a front for a materialistic cult it is easy to forget that Maharaji is a 15/16 old child in this video and that his family set him up to front the the cult is really sad. There is a scene where devotee's are kissing his feet and he looks clearly distressed by this. And here we get an insight into the divine child that ""the life or brian"" missed out on.that maharaji is not ""a very naughty boy."" but he has a mother/parent  making a business around him. not unlike say Michael Jackson. Another movie which I though of when seeing this film was ""The Girl Next Door 2007"" as both films portray the horrors of child abuse in graphic ways.
Listening to Maharaji speak, I hear a less wise person speak but I see the spark in him that allowed him to survive the madness that was all around this documentary. If amazon can show this,then surely the can now share ""Inside Peace"" 2016 to get an idea of how the good in Maharaji /Prem Rawat has the potential to help and heal some of those who feel they have lost all hope.",1498694400,,1641,4.160377358490566

It's a 4 step meditation process taught by many gurus before him. He capitalized on this meditatiion and said he was the lord of the universe. Sounded good in early 70s. Not only was he the lord incarnate but his whole family was divine.  No divine leader would lead the lifestyle he does. His followers justify giving him so much money to him because he is ""divine"".  It's as if they are buying spirituality and hoping that it pays off.

I am really glad I left Maharahi and feel that people that buy his baloney are unfortunately stuck in his brand of spirituality. The purpose of life isn't to meditate.",1361923200,,726,4.484848484848484

7914610,5,B00001OX01,"Dear Readers/viewers,

""Lord Of The Universe"" video documentary of the event which took place in the November 1973 is a Fantastic Piece of History.

Mr. Prem Rawat, also widely known by the affectionate and honarary title, Maharaji by many touched by his message of Peace, Inner Contentment and Hope. I am one of the fortunate ones who have received his gift of the Four Techniques of Knowledge or Self-Knowledge back in 1988, when all these old Indian traditional ""Terminologies"" and ""Methods"" were thankfully brought to an end by Maharaji. Having heard different stories from his early arrival in the West from various sources including the People who were there around that time, including my wife, Mahatmas or instructors including Charan Anand, who is now 76 and read many magazine articles, having even watched some film/video footages from the events from the early 70's through to the mid eighties, gave me some real insights.

Having judged from my own feelings and understandings of what this was really all about, I decided to persue it and eventually received the Gift Of the 4 techniques described not only in this documentary but in many ancient scriptures, as these were always imparted by the specially gifted people, it doesn't matter what people have called them or are even calling them today, e.g. Satguru, Perfect Master, Guru Maharaj ji or simply the Master of their Times as Mr. Rawat is doing now.

This video is like the Window in that time. Looking at the buzz, enthusiasm of the people wanting to spread the word, message of Peace, hope and telling people that there is now somebody giving the way to feel that inner joy, supreme bliss on this planet and has arrived in the West, the USA. Sharing their enthusiasm has inspired thousands like me to look into this, explore further.

No matter what anyone have said in their reviews either negative things or reacted to the negative comments made by some who have decided to exploit people's fears and ignorance, the basic message of Peace has been conveyed. The definitions of terminologies like Darshan, Mahatma, etc. are on the spot and even people of now can benefit from this.

The ONLY thing I would like to have edited out is when someone is demonstrating the 4 Techniques and describing them and the experiences expected from them. This is because the names and the order of the techniques were updated by their rightfull owner and giver, Maharaji back in the late 80's when he decided to impart them personally. There were a lot of flaws in the methods Mahatmas were using in imparting these techniques. As shown and described on this video, will give false expectations to the people aspiring to receive them from Maharaji and do them immense Dis-Service. That's why one of the three promises Maharaji asks before showing the techniques (even Mahatmas went through this in those days) is, ""Please don't show these techniques to someone else. Let them take their own journey towards their own heart and coming from that sincere place asking for this gift, they too will also be able to receive."" There is nothing secretive about anything. People coming from their own understanding will be able to accept the feeling coming from their own core of being and enjoy it to the fullest for the rest of their lives.

I love this video and have recommended to other like minded individuals to purchase it.",1201478400,9,3382,4.861111111111111
7914611,1,B00001OX01,"It does not matter who or what you think about Maharaji.  The reality is that he can do what he says he can do-reveal to us an experience of peace already within us but at some point in human existence we lost the ability to contact.  He just opens the door back up and when he does, you know it if you are sincere in your desire to go within.  If your not, it can look like a sham I guess because techniques and the experience are so simple and yet so incredibly profound.

I received Knowledge in 1974 and have been practicing ever since.  At first I could not relate to Maharaji and that was OK.  I knew Knowledge was true, but I really did not know how to relate to him.  Then the more I practiced, the more my life changed (my inner life)and I felt peace like I had never felt it before, happiness I had never felt before and I started feeling so much gratitude towards him for showing me such an incredible gift and then I just fell in love with him as a person for his warmth, his persistence, his passion, his guidance, his determination to spread this possibility to as many people as possible.  I don't know who or what Maharaji is or even what to call him-""my teacher"" I guess.  But it no longer matters-what matters is my own inner experience and if it were not a true experience I am not the kind of person to make time every day for over 30 years to practice if it was not real.  I now practice (or meditate) an hour and a half in the morning and it seems like 15 minutes.  It changes my day and changes my attitude towards life.  I am not always choosing peace, sometimes I get caught up in the drama of life-but I always know where home is and how to get back.  That is the pure beauty of it.  All you have to do is just stop and go inside and it all changes. The word grateful does not even cut it.  There are no words.  Maharaji always says try it and if you like it fine-if you don't fine.  I had good friends who stopped practicing for years and now I see them all coming back.  Maharaji judges no one and lets everyone have their own journey in their own time.  This is a process-not a quick fix.  I thought 30 years ago I would be ""enlightened"" by now, but I still have the struggles of being a human being and that's okay because I always have the choice to go inside and experience something so soothing and so contentful and  loving.  It does not get any better than that.  It does not matter if you agree or disagree  with him or believe in him or whatever.  Maharaji does not care because what he is revealing speaks for itself.",1181260800,16,2555,4.123481781376518
7914612,3,B00001OX01,"What a fascinating glimpse into the past this video presents, revisiting the early days of Maharaji's emergence in the West.  The cameras don't lie: they show it all -- from the innocent and unrestrained enthusiasm of Maharaji's early followers to the emotional and sometimes illogical extremes to which that enthusiasm can sometimes lead.  Yep, I was there, and saw it unfold right before my very eyes.  I had heard the buzz about Maharaji, and I attended the Millenium festival in Houston to investigate for myself.  To say that the experience was fascinating and at times very confusing is an understatement, but the outcome of my attendance at that event was to strengthen my resolve to find out for myself what was at the bottom of all the commotion surrounding the message that Maharaji was presenting.  Eventually, after returning back home to Boston from the event in Houston, I came to the point where I made the decision that I wanted to be shown the techniques for experiencing inner peace that Maharaji was offering, as that seemed really to be the ultimate test of the validity of his message.  Years later, I still consider myself extremely fortunate that I happened to hear Maharaji's message way back then, and that I followed up on investigating it, as it has turned out that what he was speaking about is indeed real, and something that is incredibly useful and rewarding when I choose to take advantage of it.

 What is a shame about this video is that, although it may present a valid record of events that did occur at one specific time in history, it doesn't go on to follow the story so we can see how it evolved from that point onward.  Although what is presented in this video is something that seems to have all the trappings common of the many cult phenomena that were so prevalent in the post-hippie years of the seventies, we don't get the wider perspective of how things developed from that point onward.  When Maharaji first came to the West, he was a very young boy, and the presentation of his message was largely managed and manipulated by his mother, who had a vested interest in keeping a personality cult live and healthy.  It would have been great to have included an update to the original video, chronicling Maharaji's split with the elements of his family that had wanted to maintain a personality cult, his steady efforts to strip away all the traditional Indian religious trappings that had initially been obscuring and complicating the simplicity of the message and gift that he had to offer, his dissolution of the once prevalent ashram system that gave the misleading appearance that adoption of the tools which he offered required a parallel adoption of specific lifestyle constraints, and his efforts to make his message and the techniques for experiencing inner peace widely available to people via public access tools such as the internet free of charge so that people can investigate for themselves, at their own pace and without fear of any kind of ""group pressure"" phenomena to cloud their perception.

 How is it that Maharaji has evolved from what once many would have considered a cult leader, to someone who is now invited to speak at forums as diverse as the United Nations, premier institutions of higher learning such as Harvard and Oxford Universities, audiences consisting of current and former members of governments around the world, gatherings of distinguished guests at events such as the Universal Forum of Cultures in Barcelona Spain, and yet also continue to find tremendous enthusiasm among huge audiences of simple common folk around the world?  Why is it that within the last year he has been presented with honors and recognition from prominent figures such as US governors, the mayors of Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Miami, the former President of the European Parliament and Prime minister of Italy?  How has he gone from speaking before small informal groups gathered in living rooms and back yards when he first came to the West, to the point that weekly broadcasts of excerpts of his message delivered to live audiences, in the ""Words of Peace"" series, are broadcast around the world, and have earned recognition as diverse as the top award of the Brazilian Association of Community Television Channels, and ranking as the sixth most popular program on Bris 31 in Australia, after less than two years of being broadcast in either location?

  Indeed, the snapshot of the past presented by this documentary is intriguing, but if it stirs your curiosity, I suggest you visit a web site such as [...] to see where the story has evolved to from those unique beginnings many years ago and how you can find out more on your own.  I suspect the best is yet to come, and checking it out for yourself may be better than any video ever could be.  The way I originally looked at it those many years ago was that I had nothing to loose by investigating the situation, and possibly lots to gain.  I think that still holds true for anyone today, and the ""investigation"" part has been made lots easier by electronic access media such as the internet.  Let the adventure begin...",1138924800,84,5144,4.814982973893303
7914613,2,B00001OX01,"I was there. I had just begun hearing about and listening to what Maharaji had to say. And I had also attended meetings where Maharaji was not present. There did seem to be a possibility for something like groupthink (to adopt Irving Janis's term) in some of the situations where Maharaji was not present.  As suggested by an old quote, we can be very political animals. But that doesn't excuse a person from being individually responsible and accountable.

Today, technology makes it a lot easier to hear what Prem Rawat actually has to say.  In 1973, VCRs, DVDs, satellite broadcasts, CDs, iPods, web radio, and Quicktime movies on the web simply did not exist.  Today, just as for any author or speaker, I can use these technologies to watch and listen in the privacy of my own home.  In 1973, this was not feasible.

The length of this video is about as long as Prem Rawat speaks at most venues.  However, the majority of the video comprises-- not him speaking-- but others speaking.  This is somewhat like a video about a composer, a musician, a poet, or an author that presents very little of the author's work, but instead presents the opinions of literary critics (those who speak against, as well as those who try to speak for, the author). It would be one thing to see this kind of video, while it would be quite another to see a video of the author's actual work.  Certainly, there will always be different kinds of audiences.  Some might prefer to hear only the critics. Others might want to hear both the critics and the author. While yet others might want to hear only the author.  I guess I'm one of those who mainly wants to hear, for himself, what the author has to say.",1127088000,64,1687,4.534653465346534
7914614,5,B00001OX01,"I can see how current members of the Prem Rawat/Maharaji cult wouldn't like this video, mostly because it shows a history of their master that his cult is trying very hard to hide from the public, because it doesn't fit into his current PR campaign to get new devotees.

There is nothing biased, or one-sided, about this video, and it certainly isn't ""amateur"" and it wasn't put together by Maharaji's former followers (disgruntled or otherwise).  In fact, it's an extremely well done documentary made for PBS that documents, (without any narration or explanation/analysis whatsoever), a period in American history, specifically, what actually happened at the 1973 Millennium festival, when Mr. Rawat, the living ""Perfect Master,""  said he was going to present his plan for world peace.  The video simply records the actual speeches of Mr. Rawat and the statements of his devotees.

The end result is an historical record of a young Guru, who believes he is the incarnation of God, who seems to have a pathological need to be worshipped, and the idealistic young people who got caught up in his cult back in the mid-70s.  The fact that this story does not fit conveniently in Mr. Rawat's attempts, over the years, to pretend those embarassing events never happened, may upset his followers, but it does not in any way discredit the historians, nor the thousands of people who witnessed those events.",1113523200,19,1399,4.982832618025751
7914615,3,B00001OX01,"It's obvious that the producers of this documentary went out of their way to paint a portrait of Maharaji in the worst  possible light.  I received his Knowledge in 1982 after most of the Indian concepts and rituals were removed.  All I can say is that if you truly want to experience inner peace, this man can help.

  His message continues today and around the world, millions of his students respect and love him.  The disgruntled ones who howl into the wind calling him a fraud, con artist, etc., are simply not credible.  Many of them got swept up into the excitement and magic of those early years and they had agendas and concepts that they carry with them now.  They are bitter and angry because Maharaji has not lived up to their concepts.

  Maharaji AKA Prem Rawat has attempted to simplify his message and present it so that thirsty souls around the world won't have to buy into the Indian trappings and rituals which were around when he first came to the West in 1971 at 13 years old.

  For those who truly want to connect with their inner essence, the gift of Knowledge enables that to occur.  Peace is possible and to those interested in experiencing it, an impartial and sincere investigation will not go unrewarded.

  I urge those who want to know the underlying reality of existence to not be dissuaded from learning more about this teacher and his Knowledge as a result of this slanted video.  This is not a cult.  It is one man sharing his method of experiencing inner peace to those who want to know it.  Knowlege works.  It's practical, simple and most enjoyable.  Maharaji is offering something supremely valuable to those who want to know how to turn within and feel the life force within them.
