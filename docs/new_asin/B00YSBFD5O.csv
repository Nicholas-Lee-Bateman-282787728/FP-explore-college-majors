7239586,5,B00YSBFD5O,"NCIS-LA Season Six doesn't waste any time re-engaging with the fan base. Callen and Sam are trapped aboard a drug-running submersible controlled by jihadists. Hetty Lange is en route Washington DC for a disciplinary hearing over Kensi's off-the-books mission last season in Afghanistan. Kensi and Deeks are trying to run down the drug smugglers who might know something about the submarine, while both are reacting to the return of a certain attractive DEA agent who is an old friend of Deeks. The episode is remarkably tense from start to finish, although there are some humorous moments when Deeks interrogates a white supremacist at a hospital, and Kensi faces off with a potential rival for Deeks. And this is just the first episode.

In a multi-episode narrative arc, the crew will deal with the aftermath of Kensi's mission to Afghanistan last season.  Callen and Sam will be launched on a slightly unauthorized mission into Mexico that ends up looking like the last stand of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.  Kensi and Deeks will face scrutiny over their relationship away from the office, and Deeks will be pursued by Internal Affairs for an old case.  No one will be safe, especially on a season-ending storyline involving oil money, terrorists, and maybe even Callen's mysterious Russian father. Welcome back, NCIS-LA fans. Enjoy the fun.  Season Six is well recommended to fans of the series.",1435276800,23,1406,5.043103448275862

7239648,5,B00YSBFD5O,"I am watching this CD (6 discs in all) even as I write this review!!  We love this series.  We were longtime fans of the original NCIS; and when we lost interest in that show a few years ago, we didn't think that this spin-off could possibly come close to equal the quality that the original NCIS once was before it grew stale and awkward!!!  But we were happy to discover that we were so wrong ... NCIS LA is well-written and action-packed with a cast that totally entertain us!!!  We were so thrilled with the show that we bought seasons 6 and 7 at the same time!!!",1526601600,,567,4.222222222222222

7239910,4,B00YSBFD5O,"Season 6 picks right up where season 5 left off, duh right.  But my point is it starts out with a bang and keeps that first episode moving quickly, so it is helpful to remember the cliff hangar of season 5.
I really like NCIS LA because the characters haven't changed.  You are allowed to really get to know the back story of each of them. The writing does have its fair share of action, but its plot line isn't ignored. You get to see if Deeks and Kensi finally get together.  You get to have past characters make more than a one episode appearance, like Nate. Sam and Callen keep the repoire going. Of course Beal and Jones are still the geek squad but are allowed to see a bit more action, which helps to move their characters along. Then we come to Granger and Heddy they still have their past that gets slowly peeled back, just enough.
I like the series so much that I have watched them several times through. You can always pick up on things you missed the first time, which in my book is a hallmark of a good series-the watchability.",1453334400,3,1040,4.269035532994923

7239988,5,B00YSBFD5O,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

I find that as the releases of various series make it to DVD Im writing repetitively about the fact that more and more shows have a feeling that the characters involved have a family feel to them, a dynamic that places them in various jobs or situations but that the characters relate to one another as a family would. Personally I look at this as a positive thing. All of us would love to live in a world where we related to one another, especially in the workplace, as family. So when I watched this season of NCIS: LOS ANGELES I was struck once more with that feeling, and in watching it as a fan the cast begins to feel like our extended family as well.

Season Six kicks off with Callen (Chris ODonnell) and Sam (LL Cool J) still trapped in the submarine we saw them in at the end of the last cliffhanging episode of season five. While not actually a spoiler you know theyll get out fine, otherwise this season would be more of an introduction of completely new characters rather than those weve grown accustomed to. Other topics in this season include a possible mole in their group, murder by drone, Callen becoming a hostage while undercover and being sent far and wide around the globe.

But as with most seasons of this series there are two main focuses that happen. The first and foremost is that the team here is less about investigating murders and such (which I always felt the original NCIS did) and more about confronting the threat of terrorist organizations that might attack the U.S. The second is always a secondary story that seems to involve one of the cast members. This time around its Hetty (Linda Hunt) who is under investigation by the Department of Justice for possible misdeeds of her past. When something like this happens it always seems to be the efforts of a politician more inclined to furthering his own goals and power than it is about finding out the truth or protecting the country. Never let it be said that television programs aren't always as up to date on Washington as we might think.

We also get to see the relationship between Kensi (Daniella Ruah) and Deeks (Eric Christian Olsen) play out as well. The romantic inclination between these two has been going on since season one but never was realized until the last two. This season it appears that they have taken to spending the nights at one anothers houses. As they become closer they also find the feat that underlies falling in love with someone as well as trying to keep things professional at work. Its one of those deals where everyone knows they're seeing one another even if they're not supposed to but no one is worried about it.

The final episode leaves us once more with unanswered questions concerning the family of Callen with an episode that involves the recurring character of Arkady Kolcheck (Vyto Ruginis). The episode takes the crew to Russia where they take on various undercover identities to search for a suspect. Not only does it offer clues to Callens father that are left open, it ends the season with a search for Arkady that picks up in the new season that began last week as of this writing.

What makes the series work is the comradery that runs through the team presented here. Its a closeness that, as I said, appears to create an extended family between them. Even the most stalwart of the group, their leader Hetty, has a deeply devoted affection for each and every one of the team members. Their willingness to step outside of the bounds of comfort to rescue or stand up for one another makes them a formidable force when dealing with the bad guys that they do. It also runs into the more personal aspects of their life. Knowing that someone would go the distance for you would make a near unbeatable force to be reckoned with and this team appears to be just that.

By the end of the season we fans have grown more fascinated by the team presented, more involved in their stories and have gained a deeper feeling for each and every one of them. There is no single performance here to judge as above the others. Each one of the actors brings their A game and none appear better than the rest. That says a lot about the behind the scenes comradery that they must certainly share as well. To make it through one season and still work well is one thing, to make it through six and head into a seventh says a lot more. In the end fans will love that they can have this series on their shelf and perhaps others will gravitate towards it with the availability to do so. I for one hope that it continues on for some time.",1443484800,3,4603,4.485680190930788

7240003,4,B00YSBFD5O,"Callem may not be the strongest actor, but the rest of the cast is top-notch.  It is the ensamble acting that makes this so entertaining.  The body count is always very high, and in the spirit of the old West, the good guys shoot, kill, and then blow the smoke off the gun barrel and go have a beer.  This is the personality that the show adopted after the first season and it works well.  The writing is strong, but not nearly as strong as the original NCIS.  Overall, however, the show is fun to watch.",1442880000,,504,4.208333333333333
