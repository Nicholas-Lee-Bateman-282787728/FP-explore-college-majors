3496053,4,B001BNFR76,"""Before the Rains"" is a solid Merchant Ivory production.  Director Santosh Sivan who has worked extensively as a cinematographer keeps the pacing lyrical so that we can take time to see the beauty of the region.  India in the 1930s has a magical glow.  Henry Moores is a British journalist whose wife is travelling as the film begins.  Linus Roache who was nominated for a Golden Globe in 2002 for ""RFK"" plays the entrepreneur walking the tightrope between the bank and building a new road.  Rahul Bose as his right-hand assistant T.K. is brilliant.  I thought his performance was moving and sensitive.

Moores turns to his lovely housekeeper Sajani, played by Nandita Das, to satisfy his more biological urges.

3496054,4,B001BNFR76,"Before the Rains beautifully captures the tragedy of sexual attraction between a master and his slave.  The slave never wins!  Nandita Das turns in a commendable performance as an infatuated young woman who perceives the attention of the debonair British man as true love

The main problem I have with this movie is the casting of Rahul Bose.  It is almost painful to hear his malayalam (being a malayalee myself).  Given the plethora of fantastic Malayalam movie industry actors some of whom were cast in this movie why choose him?",1225324800,,532,4.866666666666666
3496055,4,B001BNFR76,"""Before the Rains"" is a sumptuous period drama set during the waning days of British imperialism in India. Most of the natives are clamoring for freedom from the colonialists yet the British carry on with their enterprises - one such enterprise is by Henry Moores [Linus Roache], a British tea planter who hopes to build a road to transport spices from the Indian state of Kerala. Moores is ably assisted by his loyal right-hand man TK [Rahul Bose] who tries to maintain a balance between two worlds, East and West, often precariously. Moores' family is back in England and from the beginning of the movie, viewers are made aware of his illicit affair with his beguiling maidservant, the married Sanjani [Nandita Das].

When a tryst between the two is discovered by two village kids, it sets off a calamitious chain of events - Moores' family [consisting of Jennifer Ehle as his wife and a young son] return only to find things have changed, Sanjani's brute of a husband tries to physically beat the truth out of her, and TK is stuck between his loyalty to Moores and his desire to do what is right. A tragic incident acts as a catalyst that propels the story towards its inevitable conclusion.

Some may feel the story is all too predictable - the 'evil' colonialist who takes advantage of the innocent local woman, the Indian assistant who wishes to straddle both worlds but finds himself not fully belonging to either one etc, but ""Before the Rains"" is more than that. Moores' character as played by Linus Roache does show traces of redemption, and neither is Nandita Das' Sanjani just a plain old gullible village woman. This is a woman who fully knows the repercussions of her actions and is altogether willing, albeit naive. TK as credibly portrayed by Rahul Bose shows us the inner conflict in a man who believes in unity between the colonialists and Indians, yet finds that in the end, he does need to make a choice - as his father tells him ""No one gets lost on a straight road"".

The cinematography is achingly beautiful [not surprising given that the director Santosh Sivan is a successful one himself] and the score is haunting -it captures the beauty of Kerala [which happens to be one of the most beautiful states in Southern India] in all its resplendent glory. All in all, I'd recommend this to those who love period dramas, and also fans of Merchant-Ivory productions.",1224806400,7,2385,4.728365384615385
3496056,5,B001BNFR76,"Before the Rains is an enjoyable movie with everything going for it. Breathtaking visuals complimented with good acting and a strong storyline makes it a winner. There may be some scenes which wouldn't make much sense to a Western mind but I do think the movie is true to it's timeline of India before independence, the fragile Brit-Indian relationship and finally the endless superstitions some of which continue to prevail to this day.",1222387200,7,437,5.0

3496058,4,B001BNFR76,"""Before the Rains"" is a recently-released, Anglo-Indian film, set in South India during the waning days of the British colonial Raj; a lovely, evocative time and place that exerts a certain fascination, still; and has been looked at by a number of British films, and several --really slow-moving---films of the Merchant-Ivory film-making school.  It's exquisite to look at, while actually boasting a plot that moves right along, and stars some gorgeous people giving us a passionate, moving story of a mature interracial love affair.

Linus Roache(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Begins/dp/B000PC6A3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman Begins </a>) stars as Henry Moores, an Englishman who's big in the spice trade: he's settled on an estate in India, and hopes to build a road that would enable him to greatly expand the productivity of his plantations.  The beauteous Jennifer Ehle (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pride-and-Prejudice-The-Special-Edition-A-E-1996/dp/B00005MP58/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E, 1996)</a>), turns in a restrained performance as his wife Laura.  Rahul Bose turns in a thoughtful performance as TK Neelan, a resident of the local village, caught between his respect for the past, and his hopes for a bright English-assisted future.  The always reliable veteran John Standing is Charles Humphries, a grandee of the local expat English community.  And the beautiful Nandita Das is stunning as Sajani,the servant who catches Moores' eye, with disastrous results for all concerned.

3496059,4,B001BNFR76,"Beautiful scenery, an illicit love affair, a road being built up a mountain with the goal of growing spices, other than just tea.  There is a lot to this movie and yet it is a not a complicated plot.  An English grower is in India without his wife and falls for the beautiful house girl (played by the absolutely gorgeous and wonderful Nandita Das).  The grower's wife shows up with their son and the house girl's husband finds out she is having an affair.  Without spoiling the movie, it is enough to say that everyone pays a terrible price in the end for this affair.  Some of the Merchant Ivory productions are slow and boring.  This one keeps you wondering how it is going to turn out.  The end is tragic, but there couldn't have been any other ending.  The movie is a little slow in places, but never boring.

I thought it was a love story where both would of made huge sacrifices to be with each other. But instead,she found love in a man that could never be with her. What i truly could not understand,why was it meant for the viewer to believe that he was in love with her? Yet, he did not have enough affection to admit this,or sabotage his own family. She was a secret basically,her British lover was her lifeline. I did not like that one word of him not acknowledging his love for her, made her lose complete hope,then she took her own life. I thought this part completely ridiculous,but i guess she felt dead with her own husband. It seemed like being married to her own husband was like that of a job or slave, and feelings of being unappreciated. But her life was already in danger being from a culture and people that did not accept infidelity. What a sad life,but like many human beings,we want what we sometimes cannot have, or things that are off limits. Regardless, this British man did her wrong,also his assistant,and his wife as well. Truly, he wanted his cake and eat it too,in my opinion. This poor woman made sacrifices which jeopardized her life,as well as the assistant. Somehow,i was hoping it would not end tragically. When i watch the preview and trailer, it was easy to imagine that she would either be with his assistant, or perhaps the assistant would be jealous of the bond. I wish that was the case, but there was more injustice to these two people that were loyal to this British man. The assistant was wrongly accused and still tried to stay or remain loyal even in the face of death and accusation. But him,just like her, felt indifferent to tradition,and was much of an outcast. Not a film for the romantic at heart...",1416960000,,1888,4.555882352941176

3496090,3,B001BNFR76,"When you watch a Merchant Ivory production you can expect lush camera views, solid acting and a good story. This is true of Before the Rains. A well performed movie that places remote rural India on lovely and romantic display.

The problem is that we have seen and read this story before. From Rudyard Kipling's The Man who Would be King on through
A Passage to India
Jewel in the Crown
Pillow Book,
Even Merchant Ivory's movies like Heat and Dust or
the otherwise humorous Outsourced,
all come down to the same warning. East meets West, man meets woman and; to borrow from another movie: ""Oh, yeah. Oooh, ahhh, that's how it always starts. Then later there's running and screaming."" If you add in a pistol, make sure someone has life insurance. Chekov's gun principle rules in the theater of the British Raj.

There is a fair wrinkle in this variation of the Raj the love triangle (is it a polygon if the lovers are both also married to others?). The weight of the impending tragedy will fall on NK Neeland the Indian brains behind the Imperial British Heel, sorry this time he is just a planter. NK lives bestride the two cultures. He also has to deal with the rising Indian Independence movement. Ultimately he has to handle all of the details of his boss's love affair then handle all of its implications for the planter and for his own village.

Before the Rains is not a bad movie. If you come to this movie before most of those listed above, and have not read the dozens of variations by Kipling or WS Maugham and perhaps a dozen others, you should be able to enjoy this movie. It is performed with heart and shot in a beautiful country. If you have not seen the storyline too many times before; this can be a good entertainment.",1370908800,2,1737,4.4905063291139244

A mixture of social commentary and period-piece melodrama, ""Before the Rains,"" directed by Santosh Sivan, takes place in India in 1937 during the waning days of British rule.

Henry Moores (Linus Roache) is an English businessman living with his wife (Jennifer Ehle, the ghost-wife from ""A Gifted Man"") and young son (Leo Benedict) in the Madras district of colonial India, where he is supervising the construction of a road that must be completed before the monsoonal rains begin to fall.  Moores is also having a clandestine affair with a beautiful Indian housekeeper named Sajani (Nandita Das), who is herself married to an unloving and abusive husband from the village.  Through a series of tragic circumstances, the affair manages to have lasting repercussions not only for Moores and his family but for Anglo-Indian relations in the area as well.

The story by Cathy Rabin serves as a microcosm for what was occurring on a national scale at that time, as the oppressed natives were just beginning to assert their right to oust the British and become the leaders of their own nation.  Thus, Moores' dilemma becomes much more than just a personal one of love and marital infidelity due to the extraordinary circumstances taking place around him.  For not only is Henry breaking his own marriage vows with the affair; he is violating any number of social taboos involving race and class structure as well. The situation becomes even more complicated when another of his servants, T.K. Neelan (Rahul Boss), becomes a pawn in Moores' game to extricate himself from the consequences of his actions, and T.K. is finally forced to choose between his desire to be a part of a growing future promised by the Brits and his innate loyalty to his own people who serve under them.  The triumph of the screenplay is that each of these characters emerges as a well-meaning but often flawed individual caught in a world greater than his or her own private passions.

Even though there are times when the gravity of the social issues feels a bit diminished by the contrivance of the plotting - as if the melodrama were not commensurate in importance and value with the seriousness of the subject matter - on the whole, this is a well-acted, thoughtful and gripping drama that makes important points about colonialism, class structure, personal morality and the untamable nature of the human heart.",1326240000,3,2393,4.947630922693267

Events start to tumble out of control as the villagers spike up their protests against British rule, which brings work on the new road to a stop. The native manservant, aware of the affair between the two lovers, becomes torn between two worlds - his own heritage and concern for Sejani - and the promise of greater prosperity in partnership with the British.

Without disclosing more, the love and life in paradise, turns into a tragedy of gigantic proportions.  Young woman dies, her village tribe seeks revenge for her loss of life; British landowner looses everything: his family, his money, his future.

Interesting meditation on different times in India when locals were seeking independence from the British rule.  Cultural differences are so vast that until it is too late neither side understands the other.  It is also a story that tells us that all actions have their consequences.
