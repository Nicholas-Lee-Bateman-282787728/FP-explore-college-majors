8048121,4,B0007LFPUC,"John Renbourn is a giant of English folk gutiar.  This lessons covers some of his best  known pieces.  Teriffic arrangements, taught by the man himself.  Caveats. Some knowledge of basic fingerpicking methods and the fretboard will help you assimilate what JR has to say.  John (RIP) was an affable chap, he walks you through the phrases clearly enough but he moves quickly and did not, for me,  really explain what he's doing in a musical sense. But if you have the chops and like the music, then this is for you.",1420588800,,514,4.593406593406593
