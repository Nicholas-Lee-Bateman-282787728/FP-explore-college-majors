8575176,5,B00BXTKK70,Brought back so many memories watching video.  I was only 10 and watched with my Grandmother Rideout who was very into all things English royalty which started my interest which continues to this day.  My heritage is English on both sides in fact have a verified ancestor  that came over on the Mayflower.  This same Grandmother  was the relative thus the added interest in all things English.,1490572800,,393,4.8059701492537314

8575178,1,B00BXTKK70,I wanted a recording of the actual service and ceremony but this was just excerpts from news clips and other background fluff...almost nothing of the pageantry of the actual coronation...the music and grandeur was missing.  Bit disappointment,1487203200,3,242,5.54054054054054

8575185,5,B00BXTKK70,"This DVD gives you a 50 minute (there are closed captions) look at the Coronation of Elizabeth II and behind the scenes of the coronation. We see, even the rehearsals with the queen's stand in.
Some of the films are colour, some black and white. This is very successful at showing what the coronation meant to the English people and the world. Events are explained by some unobtrusive talking heads-historians, attendants and authors.

There are films of the grandeur of the event, parades, decorations and the designs submitted to Elizabeth for her gown. Amazing films of the Abby being transformed for the coronation and the rush to send films by helicopter and jet to the rest of the world are among the many topics covered.
This is a wonderful video for lovers of Great Britain, the monarchy, the queen and history.",1376784000,9,819,4.808510638297872
