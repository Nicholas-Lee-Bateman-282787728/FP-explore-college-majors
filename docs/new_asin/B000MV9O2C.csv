8172842,2,B000MV9O2C,"This western version of the Soviet film Nebo zovet was distributed by Roger Corman in the U.S. A completely new dialogue was dubbed and additional scenes were created by the then film student Francis Ford Coppola. The special effects were supposed to be spectacular for 1962. I remember seeing the film in a theater when it was released. When I saw the DVD I decided to add it to my collection of science fiction movies from the 1950s and 1960s. The DVD version is not so great. The colors are very desaturated and the plot and acting have not improved over the years.  That's OK since a large portion of my collection consists of bad science fiction. There were many great or at least fun science fiction movies from the 50s and 60s but this is not one of them. It bumped the 1950 Colonial Production's The Flying Saucer out of the ""worst movie in my collection"" status.",1396483200,3,871,4.512658227848101
8172843,1,B000MV9O2C,"It's a bomb. save your $$. The cinamatography sucks. low budget Russian flick.
i will say though that the ships in outer space look decent, for the time period. other than that though,,, you get astronaughts -or - Cosmonaughts walking around in space with no gravity effect, and walking on paintings rather that props (it looks like).
wanna buy my copy ?",1386806400,,354,4.725806451612903
8172844,2,B000MV9O2C,"Russian film to which R. Corman contributed (via Editing)a 2&1/2 min. ""MONSTER SCENE"" near the end in order to deprive Saturday Matinee goers(Kids Under 12)in the 60s of QUARTERS. He paid the Artist more for the catchy one sheet(movie poster) than was spent on the rest of the entire production. Sci-Fi at It'S WORST!",1305072000,3,317,4.888888888888889
8172845,1,B000MV9O2C,"The hype for this film speaks of being ""billions of light years"" in space.  This is of course hooey, since it goes no further than Mars, not even 1 (one) light year from here.

Given the technical limitations at the time this was filmed, it's not all that bad.  Try not to laugh too much at the alien creatures.  However, AVOID THIS THING LIKE THE PLAGUE.

First of all, the color reproduction is pallid and pinkish.  The image, moreover, is fuzzy.  There's been no remastering of this one, that's for sure.

Secondly, and most importantly, THIS COPY IS MUTILATED.  Originally  filmed in widescreen, the film has been chopped and hacked.  What's left is the so-called ""full screen"" version, a media lie trying to make the mutilated version seem desirable.  In fact, it doesn't fill my screen.  Would a 1.33:1 mutilation fill yours?  (If so, please note that we are now in the 21st Century.)  This version is missing a major percentage of what had been filmed, and therefore isn't worth the match to light the fire to burn it",1282694400,2,1024,4.64245810055866
8172846,2,B000MV9O2C,"only good i saw so far was the ok cool film continuity of space and not enough footage on the 2 weird retarded lookin corman film inserted at least not stock footage but orig. monstas where unknown somehow and unknown y the fat headless monsta swallowed the v- lookin monsta that looked like it would win but didnt. this should sell for dirt cheap .01$ but doesnt, if havent/but want to see it",1264809600,,393,4.397260273972603
8172847,2,B000MV9O2C,"This was originally made as a political space adventure movie by the former Soviet Union in 1960 as ""Nebo Zovyot"". It is essentially the story of two superpowers which battle each other on various technological fronts, particularly the exploration of space. In its original form it is much longer (but more interesting) than the Corman edition, which is just over an hour long. For the post-surgical film I consider the brief running time to be an advantage.

Corman took the original film, and with the help of a young Francis Ford Coppola (who elected to be billed as ""Thomas Colchart""...I can't imagine why) sliced in footage of a couple of the most ridiculous looking monsters in film history (one has an anatomically suggestive radula), added atrocious dubbing and produced this mess. While the thing is so sliced and diced as to be essentially worthless even as a sausage, I think the biggest downside to it is the pacing: even at its supremely short running time it's just painfully boring.

While I love movies of this genre, I can't really recommend ""Battle Beyond the Sun"" to anyone other than stalwart camp lovers or to people interested in the Soviet propaganda angle.",1217462400,6,1180,4.895
