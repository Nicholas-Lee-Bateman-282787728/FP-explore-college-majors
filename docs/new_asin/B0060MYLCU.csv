4918747,4,B0060MYLCU,"I enjoyed the season opener.  Wisely, the story started just at the point the last season's story ended. There was a familiar face interrogating Fiona and a perception of betrayal between key characters (still to be resolved). I enjoy the way the character of Michael's mother (the wonderful Sharon Gless) continues to develop, taking actions she likely would have been too afraid to take when the series began.  And I'm happy to see that Coby Bell is now in the opening credits. His character's energy fits well with the other characters, yet he maintains a distinctive viewpoint.

As for the explosions, I admit that I'm no connoisseur, but things went ""boom"" and there was smoke and flames.  Worked for me.",1340064000,15,709,4.883333333333334
4918748,2,B0060MYLCU,"Something must have changed with the creative staff because this episode was really limping. The plot seemed cursory. The acting was rough as if each scene had fewer takes then normal. Accents were uneven. The climatic explosion was shoddy. Clearly some prop towers exploded revealing the larger building completely unscathed. The only thing it demolished was any tension or doubt about Sam's survival. Fiona's interrogation scenes were poorly executed as well. She's keeps her nice dress and jewelry, no jail jump suit for her. One wonders if she was even searched. All in all I hope this isn't indicative of the remainder of the season.",1339891200,2,638,5.085714285714285

4918810,4,B0060MYLCU,"Season 6 of Burn Notice makes up for a somewhat less than stellar Season 5.  Personally I have never liked the plot device of inserting a primary character in prison.  Sure it's understandable that writers want to amp up the drama by putting someone viewers care about into jeopardy but the prison scenario has been overdone and is so full of cliches that it's painful to watch.  The season of the excellent ""Justified"" where Ava Crowder was in jail was the worst- everytime the action switched to that storyline it was tedious.  That said, my fears for more of the same this season with Fiona in prison were not assuaged by the first few episodes.  Fiona went through the usual prison stuff (threatened by other cons, dealing with corrupt guards, etc.) and it looked bleak but happily Matt Nix and company bail her out after a few episodes.  Afterwards the show really picks up steam and was back to the great action packed series the fans love.  Some crazy things happen and the killing off of a significant recurring character was quite a surprise too.  So glad Nix and his team have redeemed this great series and I'll be sad to watch the final Season 7 knowing it's all over.  Surprising technical glitch was when gun-happy Fiona threatens to give a guy a ""9mm tracheotomy"" when she's holding a Walther PPK on him.  The problem is the PPK is not chambered for 9mm; .22 and .380 yes, but no 9mm.",1468368000,,1399,4.56

4918852,4,B0060MYLCU,"Every season offers the producers and writers chances to go new places with their characters.  For season 6 of Burn Notice, that lead to some darker material than weve seen on the show before.  Personally, I missed the lighter Burn Notice.

Season 6 picks up with the aftermath of season five.  The big news here is that Michael Westens (Jeffrey Donovan) girlfriend Fiona (Gabrielle Anwar) is in prison for a crime she was framed for.  With the help of Sam (Bruce Campbell) and Jesse (Coby Bell), Michael will do whatever it takes to get Fiona out of prison.

The biggest threat they need to take down is Anson (guest star Gere Burns), the man who burn Michael all those years ago and framed Fiona today.  But getting at this man so used to hiding won't be easy.  Especially since he seems to have some help, which means theres yet another level to this conspiracy.

The producers made a conscious decision this year to get away from the client of the week plots theyve done in previous seasons.  Or so they claimed.  The first part of the season actually felt very familiar to me, the only difference being instead of someone hiring them to do a job, they were doing these jobs in exchange for help taking down Anson.  These cases of the week did diminish some as the season went along and the overall story ramped up.

Fiona actually spends quite a bit of time in prison early in the season with her own plots and sub-plots that run parallel to what the guys are doing on the outside to get her freed.  A few of those were interesting, but by the time we got her out, I was thrilled she was free.

But just about then, the season took a dark turn.  While the show has always featured our character going up against overwhelming odds, things got out of hand in the second half.  Despite the fact that the show has been dealing with smugglers, kidnappers, drug dealers, and other serious criminal elements, there was always been a bit of fun to it that helped lighten the mood.  But here, things got personal and downright depressing.  Yes, I kept watching, but it just wasn't as enjoyable as it was before.

Of course, the show still comes complete with great action sequences every week.  I certainly cant complain about those.

The acting is still top notch.  The actors were required to add some depth that wasn't there before, and they did it well.  While I haven't mentioned her yet, I should say that Sharon Gless is still a regular as Michaels mother Madeline.  While her character doesnt always drive the plot, I love it when she gets more involved in things.

There were 18 episodes this season and all of them are present in this set in their native wide screen and full surround.  Extras consist of deleted scenes, a gag reel, and a commentary on ""Shock Wave,"" the game changing episode of the season.

I still enjoyed season 6 of Burn Notice, but the darker tone kept it from being my favorite.  If you aren't familiar with the show, go back to the beginning for the run, wild ride.  And if you are already a fan, youll still want to check this season out to find out just what happens next to Michael and his crew.",1431993600,,3128,4.465608465608466

This is a darker season death, loss and conflict take center stage as Michael starts to crack under the strain.
His tracking of the people behind the Burn Notice is causing them to launch a major push back.
The season starts where five left off with Fi in prison, marked for death by the people who put her there.
Getting her out moves the team from the frying pan into the fire.
This is a dramatic season with multiple conflicts straining the teams cohesion and pitting Michael against his Mother.
Sharon Gless is nominated for an Emmy for her performance in this season.
For a show that is known for ending seasons with a cliff hanger, this might be the best cliff hanger ending yet.

4919002,5,B0060MYLCU,"Every season of show was great.  The cast was top-notch and worked great together.  Intense action scenes with plenty of character and plot development over the years.  There's really two ways to watch the show: (1) for the overall plot where Michael attempts to discover why he was burned and how he can return to being a U.S. spy, while also carving out a life for himself and his long-time girlfriend Fiona; or (2) for the subplot portrayed in each episode, where Michael, Fiona, Sam, and Jesse help ""clients"" in need by utilizing their acumen and expertise derived from each other's past experiences in military and clandestine service.  This means the average viewer could choose to watch any episode at any time without feeling lost.",1403308800,,739,4.888
4919003,5,B0060MYLCU,I've always loved this show since day one. It filled with a lot of action and has a little comedy. The story plots always keeps you wanting more.  The actors are great. Jeffrey and Coby are always very sexy.,1403222400,,207,4.3076923076923075
4919004,5,B0060MYLCU,"It's finished now, and I felt series 5/6 were not as good as previously, so maybe about right that it did end on series 7 (which was an astonishing culmination), waiting for a cheap-ish box set so I can enjoy it all over again.",1402876800,,227,4.181818181818182
4919005,5,B0060MYLCU,"I watched most of the episodes on television, slowly recording them as the repeats air. I finally got to where I caught up to the recorded, thus on to Amazon to finish a few. Entertaining, and I thought it was always true to the premise.",1401840000,,237,4.288888888888889

4919035,3,B0060MYLCU,"Burn notice was a really fun series until the writers began to stumble in season four, then the show stared to become awkward and the characters became less authentic.

4919036,5,B0060MYLCU,"You will not be disappointed, Burn Notice has everything in it that entertains! Jeffrey Donovan (Michael) is perfect, Great ""eye candy"" for the ladies and good acting ability.

Special Mention: Bruce Campbell is soooooo HOT! He still gots ""it"" and adds the perfect comic relief to the show. He can be my side-kick any time!!

Gabrielle Anwar is adequate eye candy for the gentlemen and that gal is one tough cookie, Whoa - don't mess with her! The show is great, I have to have all the seasons and you will be happy with the purchase if you decide to own the DVD series.",1395878400,,570,4.471153846153846

4919048,4,B0060MYLCU,"I really enjoyed seasons 1-4. The last 2 seasons I liked because I grew to love the characters. All good things come to an end and it was wise to end this one. Glad Michael and Fi could end up together and happy that Sam and Jesse are still alive and can be free to go on to other things. This show is like a non stop roller coaster ride. Funny, witty, and full of neat ideas and gadgets, kind of reminds me of MacGyver the way they could  make something out of nothing.",1395187200,,470,4.0
4919049,5,B0060MYLCU,"I have loved this series from its pilot episode.  Aside from the perfect casting and great writing, I love the bits of spycraft thrown in throughout.

4919054,5,B0060MYLCU,I love this show. it just has all the right components and I was so sad to realize that I was almost at the end with only one more season to go. Michael and Fiona's chemistry is great. Jesse and Sam provide a great counter balance as a comedic relief. it's great to see they don't take themselves too seriously but really have fun with the show. and I love the mother. wish she would stop smoking though. I'm also amazed at the great cast choices for the characters in different episodes.,1394236800,,488,4.315217391304348

AND keep in mind that this is a show that is also available for streaming FOR FREE with a far cheaper netflix subscription.  This is the reason I hate TV now.  If anything...

4919173,5,B0060MYLCU,Burn notice continues to deliver a tense and engaging story. They have managed to keep this story line going at a high level of excitement for six seasons now. The acting and writing are a testimony to the cast. Well done.,1380758400,,222,4.439024390243903

One of my friends recommended I watch Burn Notice since I love the show White Collar. I have literally been on a Netflix Marathon, but until recently they haven't had this sixth season added so I made the purchase...I am glad I did, as I was able to catch up in time to watch the last season as it aired.",1380672000,,322,4.046875
4919176,1,B0060MYLCU,"Unrealistic plots and twists nose dive this originally fresh and fun show into the mud.  Awful, awful, show. It is unfortunate that the story lines continued to get more beserk until you just give up on it as we did during season 6; Im not sure of what it is that makes people write good reviews for bad performances. One thing is certain the writing and directing brought out really weak acting and heralded the shows finally departure into the world of entertainment garbage, and everyone should be embarrassed for making a mess of a once brilliant show; including the viewers who give the show good marks for season 6. I will be leary of watching any of the main characters in anything new since they obviously didn't care what kind of performance they gave--or maybe it was that they knew that this was becoming obsessively sophomoric and irrational, and it showed in their ""acting""--it left us confounded and dizzy and with money out of our pocket. Won't bother catching season 7 as we never made it through season 6. Season 1-4 were quite good, 5 starting to ""linger"" between the boundaries of good taste.

You need to see it from season 1, to appreciate the character development, but this last season is keeping the truly high standards the show set from the beginning.  If you like spy movies, and would like to see several episodes of the Bourne movies, then this is for you.  Suitable for teens and above, this is mind blowing spy action.  Again,  I will miss this show immensely.  :-(",1377388800,,425,4.384615384615385
4919221,5,B0060MYLCU,"Season six was by far the best of the series so far. More intrigue, lots of action and perhaps a more serious approach than in some of the earlier ones. Intricate plots and tight screen writing. Loved it!",1377388800,,204,4.394736842105263

4919225,5,B0060MYLCU,"Burn Notice is the best show on TV today.

Series six keeps the drama coming as Michael, Fi, Sam and Jesse try and keep the bad guys at bay.

There are lots of gun play, explosions, tough cases, and good advice to the budding spy in series 6. This show has managed to keep its high standard throughout the 6 years.

If you have not seen this show, what are you doing?",1377043200,,367,4.069444444444445
4919226,3,B0060MYLCU,"Season Six was a bit of a departure for Burn Notice. First of all, the title no longer makes any sense, since he's not a burned spy anymore. Actually, he's a fugitive for most of this season. There are some really good shows, such as the one where he visits Fiona in prison, and there are some real stinkers too. Overall, the episodes are more serious with main characters getting shot, imprisoned, or even killed. Some of it you have to wonder why it was done, since it did little to advance the show. The events surrounding Nate, for example, seemed kind of pointless. Also, I found the anger scenes to be very forced when Michael tries to get Fiona out of prison. I enjoy the show, but this wasn't my favorite season. I hope it's not a sign of things going downhill.",1376870400,,769,4.384615384615385

4919239,2,B0060MYLCU,"Season 6 is sour from the start. The plot is choppy, boring, whi cares? Maddie and Nat show up for like 5 seconds, then exit. Why? What for? Nothing besides some VERY poorly written dialogue. Very poor dialogue. It's like listening to a high school writing class. I cringed a few times. These characters don't talk like this. Ever. No context, no set up, just stuff like - ""I was your star pupil!"" What!? Not ""I was the best"" or ""I am the best"" but ""star pupil""? Michael doesn't talk like that! NO ONE talks like that in real life. Sam isn't funny anymore. He's just a grumpy dad whose son Michael won't listen to him. At one point Michael pulls a gun on him. Sorry, but I don't see that EVER happening no matter the trouble Fiona is in. And Sam got punched in the face by a trucker without even trying to block or avoid, an angry trucker they saw coming a mile away. I'm sorry, but who ever they got writing Season 6 is doing a lousy job. There is nothing clever or creative or fun in Season 6, and cleverness and fun was what this show had going for it. No sarcasm or joking around or humor. Its just a bunch of explosions and guns in a predictable, typical plot. I own season 1-5 and I'm sad to say, I won't be spending any money on Season 6. What a shame.",1376697600,,1259,4.142857142857143

4919249,2,B0060MYLCU,"After a very bright start to the series (several years of bright, clever and engaging acting, writing and storylines), Nix went off track to avoid becoming stale. That was not inherently a bad idea. A bit jarring to take the lead character from brilliant to lucky-to-survive, but still in good fun. Unfortunately, everyone involved in the enterprise anticipated its demise and did a hit and run. Season 6 and (so far) Season 7 are an ode to ""phoning it in."" Writing is dismal; dialogue is trite, banal, insipid and often out of character; and conflict resolution relies almost solely on deus ex machina.
I suffer along with Mr Campbell and Ms Gless as they try to deliver this jibberish with a straight face (Mr. Bell gets spared from the worst due to limited lines) and Ms Anwar and Mr Donovan appear to be imagining that happy place that is their respective bank accounts (really: Ms Anwar does commercials that air during broadcast of episodes of Burn Notice - REALLY!).

I shared them with my husband and we found the earlier seasons streaming on Netflix. Burn Notice is a good series that both men and women will enjoy. Good personalities, enough drama and campy enough not to take itself too seriously. Plus the ""tips on how to be a spy"" are priceless. I found that Season 6 wasn't out in streaming and season 7 will be the end of the series. We didn't want to risk finding out ""how it ends"" before seeing this season.

4919386,5,B0060MYLCU,"I've been watching Burn Notice since the beginning.  Every episode is explosive with edge of your seat action.  The characters are the best at what they do and are tighter than any family, willing to do anything, up to and including die for each other rather than give in.  The movie on Sam Axe was great too.  Fi, Sam, Jesse & Mattie are Michaels world.
I really like the narration by Michael explaining all the little ins and outs of being a spy and how you to make whatever you need from just the least little household products.
It will be missed after Season 7.  I hope they make some movies afterwards;  I would love a movie with Michael Westen and Annie Walker from Covert Affairs; or Neal Caffrey from White Collar; all working together, something similiar to Graceland.",1373500800,,778,4.561151079136691

Explosions with bombs manufactured or made on-the-fly out of anything & everything (kind of like MacGyver on steroids). Jeffrey Donovan turns his character, Michael Weston, in to an American Spy version of James Bond-007, but better & smarter (maybe not better as in the International Playboy type that Bond is, but who cares? He's got Fi!,Shes the most perfectly, loyal, sexy, kick-ass female, anytime he wants it, lover a guy could ask for). Yachts, boats, helicopters, fast cars, airplanes & jets all over the place. Espionage & intrigue with all the acronyms... NSA, CIA, FBI & their foreign counterparts.  Fiercely protective mommas impervious to fear & large amounts of nicotine. And, last but certainly not least, what guy would not want either Bruce Campbell or Sam Axe(or a guy like Jesse)as a loyal ""I got your back"" fighting & drinking buddy/best friend?

Poor Sam gets nothing but repetitive filler lines.  Michael's ability to slip in and out of accents and disguises is replaced by soap opera one-note tragic-face. Fionna's rebel strength is reduced to ""Stand By Your Man"" cliche. What a waste.",1371168000,5,389,4.953846153846154

4919537,5,B0060MYLCU,"As cornball as this show can be, at times, season 6 is actually the best season so far (in my opinion).  Where shows from earlier seasons centered on individual plots, season 6 has a really good story line that keeps you wanting more.  I did say it was a bit cornball at times didn't I : )

Watched the first 5 seasons on Netflix and then had the DVR set to record new episodes, but somehow I missed the entirity of season 6.  Glad to find it on Amazon for a reasonable price.  The video and audio quality of streaming from Amazon is very good even though I opted to purchase the SD version.

I will probably purchase more TV shows and movies from Amazon now that I've experienced the quality of their streaming service.  Although it might be nice if they could offer a monthly streaming service similar to Netflix.",1370736000,,815,4.357615894039735

Terrific ensemble cast who really coalesced up to Season Five or so.  When certain events transpired on the show, Michael developed a heaviness and grimness that permeated his approach to everything.  Also, he and Fiona don't do serious relationship scenes well.  Sam and Jesse became the most enjoyable characters for me.  I don't know how they'll end the show, but it is definitely time.

4919569,4,B0060MYLCU,"THINK about it for a moment:
Crack Commando team gets busted for a crime they didn't commit
Ace spy gets burn notice for something he didn't do

BA makes weapons out of any junk he finds
Spy makes taser from compact camera

Col Dekker is always one-step behind the A-team
The Management & the rest can never catch Michael

That said, that for me is Matt Nix's brilliance
Updating an old plot so folks tune in week after week
And most don't even realize it

I'm not complaining
BA left me wondering how he made mortars from apples and tubes

Michael Westen gives a bit more information
And his innovations seem more believable
Not that 've tried them",1368662400,,649,4.466101694915254

4919608,5,B0060MYLCU,"This is by far the greatest series I've ever watched. It's story line never dulls. The producers have found a way to keep the energy and the flow constant. I can't wait for season 7 to be produced as I can't wait to find out how Michael, Sam, Fiona, and Jesse are going to get out of the extreme dilemna they are currently in. I hope they don't kill off Sam, that would be a mistake, he's a rock solid supporting actor. To lose him would be like losing the Skipper on Gilligan's Island, or like losing Fred on I love Lucy!",1365033600,,522,4.127450980392157

4919610,5,B0060MYLCU,if you have watched the other seasons of burn notice then this season is a no brainer.  it is when many plot points are really coming together and things from 4 seasons ago are being explained and even subtle things from the first season are being fleshed out.,1364860800,,260,4.416666666666667

4919614,5,B0060MYLCU,"While the overarching plot moves rather slowly through the season, each episode is as involved as the seasons before. I do hope that next season Michael finally finishes with the CIA, though, despite the season finale indicating otherwise...",1364083200,,241,5.368421052631579
4919615,1,B0060MYLCU,every episode I've tried to watch so far gets interrupted and the screen goes black before reloading. The quality is poor. I would not recommend purchasing digital content from Amazon.,1363910400,,184,5.166666666666667

4919637,3,B0060MYLCU,"This show used to be one of my faves. Not this season! It used to have humor, and I loved learning all the spy tricks that were narrated. I'm so sick of seeing Fiona in prison and how horrible it is there! This season is so dark and more gritty, I hate it!  I've tried, and am up to episode 6, but I just hate it! I hope it's the last season or they go back to the easy friendships and banter they used to have.  Love Sam, but he seems to hardly have any part anymore, or Jesse. It's lost it's fun, now it's just dark like most other TV.

Updated after being up to episode 11.

I still like this show, but it really still doesn't have the lovely humorous parts I loved about it.  Now it really is very serious and non fun, strictly business. There are hardly any narratives of how to build things from other things that only spies would know; I always loved those, really reminded me of McGyver. I certainly don't look forward to watching this show the way I used to. It's still darker than I would like, and the lead ins are long, covering the beginning of the series up to the last episode.  I don't need that. They seem to be assuming we've forgotten the plot and why we're watching, or someone is just watching their first episode and needs to be brought up to speed.  If there is another season, I don't believe I'll be watching it.",1363305600,2,1337,4.158914728682171
4919638,5,B0060MYLCU,We were having trouble catching the last 2 shows of the season anywhere.  It was great to be able to get these on Amazon.  It was painless to download and watch and allowed us to get totally caught up.  Zulu didn't have them.,1363305600,,225,4.186046511627907

4919641,3,B0060MYLCU,"My wife and I were strong fans of the early seasons: this season we now let episodes pile up and then we watch one or two. The writing is not as strong as it was in the early seasons: Michael's voice-over narration replaces on-screen character development; Sam no longer brings any life to the story; Fiona doesn't even seem to enjoy blowing things up any more (though the ""Fiona in jail"" episodes worked.) The humor is gone: no jokes, all grim faces. Michael's arch-enemies are increasingly over the top: the need to find new ways to make Michael unjustly persecuted -- new ""burned"" scenarios -- just isn't working. Even Miami doesn't have much of a visual role: one on-ramp or hotel balcony or warehouse looks pretty much every other one. Jeffrey Donovan's ability to ""become"" different characters and his communicative smile are lost in the new stories so far. We hope the writers manage to give everyone back a personality.",1362787200,4,927,4.8

4919681,5,B0060MYLCU,"Season 6 and with season 7 going to start soon.  You already know the cast and the voice overs that charter Michael Westen does really helps make the show.  Like Connery was born to be Bond, Damon as Bourne, Jeffery Donovan is Michael Westen for TV.  With Bruce Campbell as an ex-Seal and Gabrielle Anwar as ex-IRA they are the perfect combination for a great series.

Very stylish dresser.
He had moved from Iowa to Orando years ago (Iowa winters are long), and when i would come down and visit, we would always visit Miami.

4919685,4,B0060MYLCU,"I am not sure how to keep the humor and light side of this series and get that edgey feel back that was in season 3 and 4.  They keep dredging up management to carry over from show to show and tie the plot knot, but it is wearing thin.  I love the Sam Axe character and really think they need to try a serious show of just Sam again, getting some of that Seal Storyline out in front and then have him joke away the danger and seriousness of the job.  They need to pump up the budget and get some heavy acting in there again, maybe a cameo by an A-Lister Drama series actor or some of the Sopranos characters.  Many of them would be perfect in sunny florida, reprising their roles in jersey south.  Let them do a miniseries...  3 or 4 episodes, making funny and getting that miami/new york mob connection going again in the plotline.",1361577600,,832,4.16875

Michael (Jeffrey Donovan) and Fiona (Gabrielle Anwar) have awesome chemistry that keeps the viewer begging for more. Madelaine (Sharon Gless) rocks as Michael's mom who continues to help out with fantastic support of the team. Sam Axe (Bruce Campbell) and Jesse are fantastic too. Burn Notice fans will be craving season 7 minutes after finishing watching season 6. Great action, all real stunts, fantastic writing, and superior acting combine to keep this show an addiction.

4919714,5,B0060MYLCU,"I fell into Burn Notice about 8 months ago on Netflix. Before then I had never seen a single episode. I liked the action and interesting Michael Westen voice-overs explaining the spy business. My wife didn't care too much for it. By the time I was ""burning"" through season 3, The characters had matured, Sharon Gless was no longer treated like a stooge and the writing was solid. My wife was hooked after E10- the episode that reunited ""Cagney & Lacey"". It was fun watching Gless & Daly working together yet again!

On to Season 6: I'm only through E3, but the Fiona prison visit by Michael had my wife reaching for Kleenex. I won't provide any spoilers here, but so far if you have ever had any enthusiasm for Burn Notice, you will LOVE Season 6! The writing, acting & scenery are superb!",1360713600,,789,4.479166666666667
4919715,5,B0060MYLCU,"most of what is put on television is dreck. I watch very little of it. This series has its problems, such as the fact that no one can know as much as the main character does about everything, but that is not the point. The scripts are strong and the acting superior. There is a humanity that carries through the story line and there is personal growth for the various characters. And it is fun, smart, and generally has beautiful cinematography.

Certainly there are problems with reality: prisons don't operate as depicted and it isn't quite realistic that you can blow up Miami every other week without drawing some serious attention. Local, regional, and state law enforcement do not fare well in this show.  But those are the agreements that we make when we enter the writer, director, and actors' world. We will suspend enough disbelief to let them tell their story. This series doesn't make us suspend too much and makes it worth the trade.

If ethics and personal sacrifice are important to you, this program will focus the reasons why.

I did a bit of research on the series star. Mr. Donovan's personal story may gives us an insight into how he approaches this character.

Series originator Mr. Nix comes from a storied entertainment family and he has made a significant contribution to that history.",1360627200,,1309,4.748898678414097

Season 6, like the other seasons, were exceptionally entertaining.  The characters in this series were well developed, each having something to contribute to the entertainment value.  Great acting.

I'd like to see a happy ending to this story, where peace is achieved, and the 'world was saved', so to speak.

It was amazing how each season brought something new and fresh but to me the second half of season six is too narrowly focused. I know the producers think the fans want more action but enough already. each show is blending into the other and they don't put enough emphasis on the characters. It's one shoot em up blow em up after another. And Fiona and Michael, isn't this the great love of their lives? Fiona is bitchy and rude and Michael, well, he's character is the one best developed because he is going down this dark path. And now Sam is all shmarmy (that is a real word) and Jesse, still just the sidekick. I thought they might do more with him but then just let it slide. I like to watch shows that I really like over again because it's interesting what you miss the first time around.  There's not one on seasons six that would entice me to watch again.",1356134400,6,933,4.301136363636363

4919998,4,B0060MYLCU,"Burn Notice continues to be a very entertaining program after 6 seasons.  Of course, as with any fictional TV show, there are some unrealistic and unbelievable events that as a viewer, you just have to roll with.

The dynamic 'formula' lost one most important aspect - HUMOR !!  It became too serious and became like just another action series.

I've watched seasons 1-4 many times over (Amazon Instant Video & Repeats on TV) - and it is still FUNNY every time.  I love the way they 'burn' the bad guys.

The narrating from Michael sets itself apart from all other shows.

ALL of the characters and actors just flow together  too bad Nate had to die.

Dont get me wrong, I still love Burn Notice, but am still disappointed.  The action is still really great.",1355961600,,559,4.401960784313726

This season has been a little tedious and less fun with so much focus on the painfully slow-moving plot line of the gang escaping Miami. Character relationship development is almost at a standstill and I am ready for some forward motion with respect to Michael's re-burned status with the CIA.

There is too much over-acting, the scripted lines are out of character based on the earlier shows, and the action lacks realism. The series seems to be degenerating into an updated ""mod squad"" as the story line goes flat. The story is no longer solving the mystery of who burned Michael but is now outsmarting gangsters and being on the run from the U.S. government - boring stuff.

4920036,5,B0060MYLCU,"I've generally been a fan of Burn Notice since season 1, though I must say season 6 really takes the cake for the entire show. It's got one of the best line ups for guest stars to date and is filled with more desperation and less of the Super-Spy motif that's been somewhat over played over the past few seasons. Mistakes are being made, and the crew is up against a highly intelligent and morally motivated foe.

4920088,2,B0060MYLCU,"I used to love Burn Notice because it was fun. Now with the more serious story lines and Michael's penchant for revenge, no matter what the cost, has really caused the show to go downhill.  I think they made mistakes at making Fiona a serious live-in girlfriend, and letting Madeline in out of the dark.  It's kind of like having James Bond change from Pierce Brosnan to Daniel Craig.  Still worth watching, but not nearly as fun.",1354665600,4,430,4.558441558441558
4920089,1,B0060MYLCU,"I LOVED this show (past tense)...up until this season. They deviated from their winning formula and tried to turn it into high drama, and it is an epic fail. Then they made it worse by taking several months off before airing the rest of the season. I watched Burn Notice because it had characters that were interesting, yet flawed, and that a viewer could actually like. This season, I don't care about any of them. The writers turned Michael into a cold blooded killer and the rest of the cast into ho-hum partners. Did they get new writers this season? I'm so sad to see one of my favorite shows ruined by poor writing. Oh well, we still have seasons 1-5. I guess I'll re-watch them.",1354665600,7,685,4.444444444444445

Seeing how the past five seasons have really taken their toll on the group's dynamic has added another level to this already terrific cast.

In addition to the spy storyline, there was some relationship/romantic drama, action sequences, and always a bitchin' explosion. There was never any real or disturbing violence, which is part of why I've always liked this show. As the seasons progressed, the storylines have become more nuanced and sophisticated, and the actors...they can act! Everything about the show has improved. It's fun to be along for the ride.

4920160,5,B0060MYLCU,"Great show with action, humor, and a few life lessons. Burn Notice, is a good show with good actors who make spying look as dangerous as it should be. It is a treat to see Sharon Gless, former star of Cagney and Lacey, run roughshod over the group of spies as Maddy Western the matriarch. There are even episodes where what the spies do can be viewed as funny. What it best about the show is that the shooting and blowing things up are not glossed over. They are acknowledged to be awful realities of going outside of social niceties to achieve an objective.

My favorite character is Fiona the trigger happy bomber. Even she has standards of decency that can be respected. All in all Burn Notice on the USA network is a good show into its sixth season interesting enough for me to purchase it.",1351900800,2,794,4.401360544217687

Soooo.....was HE the one ""officially"" behind Michael's burn notice?! But WHY? I have so many questions that I hope the show's writers will answer and expound upon.

4920226,5,B0060MYLCU,"Most people that love BURN NOTICE like I do, love it because it has a certain formula that's proven was working for four seasons. Breezy, smart, well-acted and fun. That was the status quo.

Then Season Five came along, and things started to get shaken up a little as showrunner Matt Nix decided it was time for a new status quo. A new, decidedly more devilish villain, Anson (the fantastically wormy Jere Burns) had come along, framed Fiona for murder and set Michael up to do his dastardly bidding in order to keep Fi out of prison. Last season ended up with Fi turning herself into the authorities, putting Anson on the run, and leaving Michael alone and desperate to do whatever he had to do in order to get Fi out of prison.

This particular side of Michael hadn't really been exposed before because we're not really used to seeing him this desperate to catch the bad guy, but even more so, we see his greatest vulnerability: The people he loves, and as this season proves, it's not always possible to save all of them.

The season begins with Michael and the CIA, primarily represented by Agent Pearce, reprised by Lauren Stamile, in breathless pursuit of Anson and anyone or anything that might lead to his capture, and Fiona doing her best to survive in prison. As it turns out, someone on the outside wants Fiona dead and this again leads back to another seemingly ancillary character from last season, Rebecca (the formidable Kristanna Loken), and Michael, Sam and Jesse (becoming a more centralized player in this season) follow up on anything that might lead to her capture. In the midst of all of this, Michael's original training officer, Tom Card (the terrific John C. McGinley) comes back into Michael's life and so does Michael's ne'er-do-well younger brother Nate (Seth Peterson), who returns back home to Mom (Can Sharon Gless get a darn Emmy nod, just once, for her extraordinary work on this show, please?) after his marriage falls apart and looks to help Michael in whatever way he can to free Fiona.

As the season goes on, things return to form for the trio on the outside and enemies become potential allies. The mad pursuit of Anson comes to a climax that ends with not one but two extremely shocking deaths and, even though one of these deaths ends up freeing Fiona, the other one wounds all of our main characters to their core, and this time, Michael, Fi, Sam and Jesse are all out for blood. When the discovery is made as to who is directly and indirectly responsible for this death, we start heading in a different direction again, as Michael does something that he knows he can never fully walk away from, and the show's direction gets darker still as CIA Agent Olivia Riley (THE WIRE's Kima Greggs herself, Sonja Sohn) vows to hunt Michael and all of his cohorts down for the crime he has committed. However, when the show threatens to get too dark, we get a bright light with the character of Calvin Schmidt (the hilariously funny and immensely likable Patton Oswalt), a master forger who can get everything they need for the team to get out of the country... but it comes at a price.

Although once we get to the season finale, the audience seems to get shafted a bit, as Riley seems to turn on a dime, because there's no clear villain left for the season. It really feels inorganic as far as her character is concerned, and even worse, it feels like Nix and the other writers just plain ran out of room for this season by packing it with too many ideas and not enough time to wrap everything up. It's certainly not the season finale I was hoping for, but at least the feeling of the cliffhanger this series is known for at its finales is ambiguous enough to let us guess as to where the show will go next.

Certainly, Season Six is a strange turn-around for the show, particularly since the previous season had a darker direction already going on, but this is the darkest the show has ever been, and it sets a new standard that no one, not even our leads, are safe. Rather than chalking it up to lazy writing or, as some would put it, ""jumping the shark"", Nix and crew have let the show evolve into something that is no longer as simply fun and formulaic, but rather something that allows for more serious stories to be told, as well as greater danger abounding for all of our characters.

There is still much fun to be had with this show, and a lot of it is in the episodes with Oswalt, whose glib one-liners and whiny faux tough-guy attitude gives the show a lot of lightheartedness.",1347148800,87,4521,4.526315789473684

Something that would make her a completely unfit mother. That way jessie's kid would have to come stay with grandma to live. It would give us another family plot line to develop through Micheal Fee and his mom. The kid could get kidnapped, Fee could fall in love with the kid and something bad happen all kinds of stuff to develop more plot lines and to see the softer side of Micheal trying to watch him have a relationship with a kid would just be funny to watch.

The part with Sam and Jesse with the loan shark was kind of nil and they should've been working with Michael to try to find out who killed Anson/Nate.  Hope the next one holds a bit more excitement.

This show is smarter than that.  Or is it?  I hope it is, cause if not, I have just invested too many years watching it for not much of a gain.

I am still a fan.  But I have seen too many serials (i.e. The Matrix, Battlestar Galactica -the new one, The X-Files) that ramble on an on with the promise that it will all make sense, and tie together and be great, only to have it fizzle and suck in the end.

I rarely write reviews.  But I figure I would this time.  Perhaps Matt Nix and crew will read it, and other similar reviews, and work to ensure this show does not suffer a crappy fate.

Now, we have a new villain, we have a new passion that Michael will have to work out (the loss of his brother and how that affects him and his relationship with his mother).  Hopefully we will see that human element of working out Michael's demons return, rather than just him being pissed off and involved in various operations.

4920320,2,B0060MYLCU,"When it first appeared ""Burn Notice"" was a change of pace from the usual detective/spy genre. The excellent cast had some interesting stories and some good underlying tension, not only between the lead actors but also the suspense about the back story. Over the years, the tension has dissipated, the back story has been filled to overflowing, and what used to be fine, crisp acting has gotten a little less crisp and fine. The fine photography remains the same, but that's about it.  If you're not familiar with this series, by all means take a look at some of their earlier work, but the more recent programs have left me disappointed.",1343260800,2,637,4.738738738738738
4920321,5,B0060MYLCU,"We are on the edge of our seat all season. Love Sam, Mike and the gang. This is a well done series. Anxious for each episode.",1343088000,7,125,3.8461538461538463
4920322,5,B0060MYLCU,It is quite amazing how this show can keep me interested after all this time. I enjoy the excitement and anticipation for every episode to come. Keep up the great work Matt Nix.,1342828800,20,177,4.393939393939394
4920323,5,B0060MYLCU,"I don't care what anybody says, sure the show started with 4 main characters that worked really well as a cast. That doesn't mean it sucks now. If you want a show to go on, you need to mix it up. Adding characters (Jessie) and changing the intentions of Michael Weston (from surviving to finding out who burned him to trying to get Fiona out of prison etc...) is what keeps the show (and others like it) interesting.

I personally accept change and understand the reasoning behind it. There will always be critics though. Let me ask you all a question. If they kept doing the same thing over and over that they did in the first season (a burned spy trying to hide but helping others in the process) how could you possibly stay interested in the show? The underlying storyline changes per season while the sub stories change per episode. This is a concept that will keep viewers interested in ""Burn Notice"".

Thats all I have to say about that.",1342224000,29,943,4.476744186046512
4920324,2,B0060MYLCU,"The series began as something fresh and fun.  Jeff Donovan (Michael) and Gabrielle Anwar (Fiona) were fun and charming together--and it was great to see a couple that was already in a relationship and to see them use that rather than just the basic push-pull of will they or won't they get together that is a downfall of so many other shows.

The ensemble cast also includes Bruce Campbell (Sam) and Sharon Gless (Madie) rounded out and balanced the storylines.  Bruce was the comic relief and Sharon was often the straight man for both Bruce and Jeff's characters.

When Jeff acted and took on different characters each week, it was fun and his accents were marvelous. He also managed to get out of tough situations by ""MacGyvering"" his way through, which added yet another dimension to the series. Gabrielle was always the dangerous sex kitten who could beat any demolition expert in any other series or movie.  It was a nice change from a hulking guy to have a smart, sexy woman in that role.

Then it all went south in the 3rd season.  In the middle of the season, the focus shifted from being a group of do-gooders, to Michael single-mindedly pursuing the people who burned him.  All other attempts at the stories and characters that made us love the show disappeared.  Then they added the character of Jesse.  It unbalanced the cast.  His acting is wooden and his character unnecessary. He added nothing to the show.  In an attempt to write storylines that included his character, they moved even further away from the original premise that made us love the show.

Now, it is limping along to it's (hopefully) conclusion.  With the series being signed up for five seasons, I can only hope that they find a way to bring back the spark that made it a hit.  It would be nice to have that chemistry back, to bring back the balance in the stories and get rid of the chaff that clogged up the gears.  This episode is yet another sad addition to a series that is now circling the drain.

It is sad to see something so fun lose the spark so quickly.  Fiona in prison?  Ugh.  Who cares?  She's wearing jump suits and it looks like a bad take on those old female prison soaps.  Michael working on his old job and still chasing down the people who burned him without helping the little  people along the way?  Boring.  Dull.  Flat.  It seems the writers are only writing for themselves and have forgotten their audience.  Sam serious, no longer dating wealthy woman and acting more like a father figure than a wise cracking friend?  I don't want to watch that.  Madie getting more involved in Michael's cases and no longer a hypochondriac?  The fun is gone with her making Michael crazy.  And Jesse???  Just say, ""No!"" next time.  It had to be a network exec that thought THAT was a good idea.

A good show gone...bad?  Sad??  Just end it now...",1342137600,4,2840,4.541501976284585
4920325,3,B0060MYLCU,"The thrill is gone.  No chemistry.  No tension.  The show is snoozable because it's predictable.  There's no good situational tension--will they catch the bad guy?  Of course.  Will Fiona's life be threatened in prison?  Of course.  Because the writers are covering two ""A"" storylines, there's little room for humor or playing on the relationships we've come to love over the past 5 years.  There's not even the decent presence of a villan to hate.

Car chases without decent explosions - yawn

Madeline as an ineffectual delivery girl? bleah  (In season 5, Madeline would have figured out a clever way to get the package away from the creep and get it to Fiona on her own.)

Sam without mojitos and snappy observations - vanilla

Michael without a cool cover story - why bother?

Fiona without killer shoes, sexy clothes, and C4 - not happenin'",1342137600,5,845,4.811188811188811

4920345,4,B0060MYLCU,"I liked it better when she was his ex-girlfriend. We are three episodes into this season and not one mention of a mojito. Remember the good old days when Michael would come to the aid of little old ladies who are beaten up by punks and did not receive help from the police. I don't know if they simply took their eye off the ball or Jeffrey Donovan is trying to win an Emmy as a distraught lover, but its not the same anymore. More action, less crying.

4920347,3,B0060MYLCU,"What I loved about Burn Notice is that it was a fun, action-packed hour with pretty, middle-aged people and just a pinch of drama.  Now,the show is just dreary.  With Fiona confined, there's only gun play, no explosions or car chases, no derisive banter between Fiona and Sam.  Without those things, the show feels flat.  Jesse is foxy, but the reason for tuning into the show--the tension and friendship between the 3 principals--just isn't there.  The scene where Michael visits Fiona in prison is touching, but not enough to make up for the other 38 minutes of meh.

The writers need to find the fun again.  If the season arc is ""will they spring Fiona from prison,"" I am done.",1340928000,5,680,4.616666666666666
