8255652,1,B0000CEUYG,"This is amateur video shot from boats and is little more than an extended commercial for a whale watching company in Canada. The photography is so bad that you'll get seasick trying to watch this. There is no editing and it's like watching someone's home movie. And the worst is that there is some ""guide"" talking in the background who is very annoying. I'm returning this for a refund. It's not even a proper DVD. It's a DVD-R with an inkjet paper label on the DVD and a homemade insert. How they have the nerve to charge $29.95 for this is beyond me.

If you want a beautiful DVD on the orcas, get Talbot's  ""Dolphins and Orcas"". Now that is a beautiful piece of work.",1233705600,7,670,4.352
