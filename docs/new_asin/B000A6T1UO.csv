2369964,1,B000A6T1UO,"We felt that this movie was absolutely awful.  It deppicts heaven as this terrible place where all the angels are mean to a new little boy who gets to heaven and doesn't know how to fly using his new wings (of course, nobody teaches him how to use them).  He is sad and lonely and misses home.  This movie was supposed to be for little kids but the last thing I would want my 2 little ones to think is that heaven is a sad place. Although it ended well, the beginning really set a bad tone and my daughter became really upset by the fact that the littlest angel was sad and crying.  I would not recommend this movie at all, and as a matter of fact I am going to try to return it.",1168819200,6,679,3.9705882352941178

2370078,5,B000A6T1UO,"My all time favorite Christian cartoon. This animation is very dear to me, due to the fact that it was the very first encounter i have ever had with the Gospel.

I wasn't brought up in a church or Christian home but God was able to sow seeds into me at a very young age through this film. Later He would water and grow those seeds, bring me to Jesus Christ!

I remember I was still in elementary/middle school when I saw this film, during the holidays (around 1990's). Even though the movie is pretty short and simple, it carries and teaches a lot of good biblical principles, such a powerful film.

Still Find this THE BEST version out there! Every time I watch this movie I will start tearing up (I'm a grown man in my mid 20's now) and I don't care what anyone thinks because I know the value of this film and what it means to me, lol.

Anyways, highly recommend! Great gifts for other people, especially to bring little ones to the Lord (like me). I will always value this movie as a special part of my life. Into my box of precious memories/treasures it will forever be.",1418860800,4,1075,4.280788177339901

2370137,5,B000A6T1UO,"I was surprised years ago to find this in Walmart. I had to get it as it brought back memories of my childhood. Back in the 50's in Southern California, they always showed this at Christmas time in my elementary schools. They would never allow this today (unfortunately). Beautiful story of God coming to earth to dwell among men. I love it and so do my older kids. and I think of the scripture that says ""Except ye become as children"". This video depicts that.",1376956800,,461,4.435294117647059

2370141,5,B000A6T1UO,"I was so excited to find this movie again, I hadn't seen it since I was very young. It got here very quickly and wasn't damaged in any way. For the price you can't beat it.",1332028800,2,172,3.8055555555555554
2370142,1,B000A6T1UO,"As previous reviewers have stated, this is horrible.  I was really looking forward to this with the kids.  It is in such bad taste, older mean jealous angels. a poor litle 4 yr old boy who apparently died and is scared and miserable and this is how he is greeted in Heaven. Ridiculous. Don't waste your money.  I wish I listened to reviews and did not waste mine!!!",1261008000,5,365,4.338235294117647
2370143,2,B000A6T1UO,If you believe Heaven is an idealistic edenic & beautiful plane of consciousness full of wonder and splendor - pass this movie by...,1198368000,,132,4.782608695652174
2370144,3,B000A6T1UO,"This is quite the story, if you are not familiar with it.  A quick summary of the plot:  A little 4 year old boy suddenly has to leave earth and become an angel.  He doesn't like heaven because he misses earth and all the other angels are annoyed with him because he acts like a little boy.  He then goes to the ""understanding angel"" who asks him what would make him happy in heaven and he says his box of special things that was under his bed on earth.  He is happy and loves his box and things get better.  Then the birth of Jesus is announced and all the angels have to come up with a gift to give.  Everyone else is making fancy gifts, but because he is little, he can't think of anything to give.  He decides to give his box of special things to the baby Jesus.  Everyone makes fun of him because it just looks like a tattered wood box.  He gets embarrassed, but God picks his gift and says it is the most special of all and then everyone is nice to the littlest angel because he has a good heart.

It is not theologically correct, but it has a lot of good messages in it.  As far as this version of the film, it is the typical f.h.e. cheap animation, but it isn't too badly done.  My toddlers like it, because it is a cute story and honestly, I think my son likes that the littlest angel flies best.

The problem is that I watch this movie with my adult ability to understand that this is a little boy who has died and he misses his dog and skipping rocks with his sister and instead of heaven being this wonderful place, he is sad and wishes he could come back.  It is a guaranteed cry-fest for mommy.  My kids don't understand why every time they watch this or mommy reads them the book, she is crying at the end.  I can't help but think that the little boy could be my little boy and how sad that would be.

It was really hard to give this a star rating because I respect the fact that a children's story can drum up such emotion in me and my kids enjoy it, but it tears my heart out every time I see it, so I hate and love this story at the same time.  It's your call.",1196294400,20,2078,4.0

He loves this movie and loved the fact the characters would always say ""Littlest Angel"" to which he would say ""I Angel baby!"" Thank you so much for having it.
