5114083,5,B007XF0WMG,"I just discovered this just released DVD of a fabulous Scottish television series that is only now coming to home video! It certainly ranks as one of the best music-related DVDs I've watched this year and is a true must-see for folk music fans (both American and Celtic) and anyone who enjoys good music, played by experts in the field.

It took a bit of research to understand why the first DVD release in the US was Season FIVE of the program. I'll try to share the info in order to avoid confusion as you check out this DVD and the series.

In 1995 Scottish fiddle player Aly Bain (best know as a founding member of the seminal Celtic band The Boys of The Lough), had a great idea for a TV series for BBC Scotland. He invited Nashville-based dobro player Jerry Douglas to invite some of his fellow musicians to come to a hunting lodge in the Scottish Highlands for a week and perform with some of the best Scottish and Irish singers and musicians, blending the acoustic sounds of both cultures as the played together and accompanied one another. The series - consisting of six 29-minute episodes was a success and, in 1998, a second season was recorded. It was another nine years until Series 3 and then two more years till Series 4 and, finally, in 2011, Series 5. The shows were released in the UK on DVD by Bain's record company, Whirlie Records, but only in the PAL format, which cannot be played on US TVs. Because they need to go back to the master tapes for NTSC, they decided to release the series in the US in non-chronological order. Series 5 is the first, to be followed by Series 2 and 4 and finally Series 1 and 3. (Plans are to record Series 6 in 2013.)

During the five seasons 245 performances captured by 179 different artists! While many are familiar to American audiences, because they are US-based or have toured here, there are wonderful new discoveries from the Scottish performers that Bain brought to the ""party"".

Since Series 5 is the first one ""out of the gate"", and the one I just finished watching, I'll spend the rest of the time on that volume. The two-DVD set contains 47 songs (including five never air on TV) by 26 artists in various combinations. Bain and Douglas are on many- but not all - of them. They are part of the 10-piece ""house band"" which also includes guitarist/mandolinist Russ Barenberg, bassist Danny Thompson, fiddle/flute player John McCusker and the lone female, Nollaig Casey, on fiddle and vocals. Among the ""guests"" are Americans Bela Fleck, Sam Bush, Eric Bibb, Amos Lee, Allison Krauss and 19-year old Sarah Jarosz. From the other side of the ocean come Phil Cunningham, Eddi Reader, accordionist Sharon Shannon and the discovery for me, singer/songwriter Iain Morrison. A sample program on this volume (program 4) features Morrison followed by Jarosz, backed by Douglas, Casey, Barenberg and Thompson. Next Krauss plays fiddle on a Bill Monroe piece, accompanied by both Bain and Casey on fiddles. We get to hear Krauss's beautiful voice later on when she signs, this time accompanied by Douglas, Barenbirg and others. This is just a sample of what's in one program. Another highlight - for me at least - was Amos Lee backed by nearly everyone mentioned (except Bain) for his song ""windows are Rolled Down"".

The camera work superb and captures the interaction between the musicians who all seem relaxed and - as Krauss states at one point - thrilled to be part of this once-in-a -lifetime experience. Director Mike Alexander separates the performances by shots of the beautiful countryside outside the lodge.

While the following performers are not in Series 5, I wanted to give you a taste of those on the earlier series - which are forth coming. There we will get to see: Kathy Mattea, Dick Gaughan, Ricky Skaggs, Michael Doucet, Kate & Anna McGarrigle, Dan Tyminski, Joan Osborne, Rufus & Martha Wainwright, John Martyn, Maura O'Connell, Nancy Griffith, James Taylor and a bunch of Celtic performers who I'm sure will surprise us.

One final word: Whirlie has also released AUDIO-only versions of this show on CD. I haven't had a chance to hear them yet. But, honestly, watching the musicians play adds so much to the enjoyment that I'm sure I'll be popping these DVDs in my player on a regular basis,

If  I could give this set six stars (or more!) I would. It's that good!

5114084,5,B007XF0WMG,"""Transatlantic Sessions"" from BBC Scotland/RT (Irish Television) brings together the cream of Scottish and Irish traditional musicians with their US counterparts. The various series, directed by Scottish ace traditional fiddler Aly Bain and Union Station's Jerry Douglas, have produced simply wonderful music. This particular series includes for the first time a blues man, Eric Bibb, and he fits in just fine. It also includes The Divine Ms Krauss. For me, the one slight negative is Sarah Jarosz, who seems slightly out of her depth in this sort of company. However, she was only 19 at the time, and clearly there's a lot more to come - and even the Alison Krausses of this world had to start somewhere (singing in a competition associated with the musical ""Annie"", as she laughingly tells Aly Bain).

All in all, a splendid entertainment.",1342483200,2,841,5.0503597122302155

5114099,5,B007XF0WMG,"Amazing artists, songs, & production. Highly recommended for music enthusiasts of all kinds!  47 songs, or so... well worth it!",1358553600,3,127,5.35
5114100,5,B007XF0WMG,"Always a fan of Alison, Jerry, Bela, Sam, and recently Sarah.  But most exciting was the intro to Irish and Scottish musicians.  Great entertainment.  Shared with friends for hours of enjoyment.",1355356800,2,194,5.193548387096774
5114101,5,B007XF0WMG,If you like Celtic and acoustic music (and especially Jerry Douglas!) this is a must have collection. It's format is a bit primitive in regards to the DVD design - feels like just a series of recordings copied to a DVD with a simple menu added. It would have benefited from some slicker menus but the music is superb!,1355184000,3,317,4.389830508474576
5114102,5,B007XF0WMG,"I was looking for Alison Krauss on Youtube and came across some videos from Transatlantic sessions. The quality of music blew me away. Mix of Country/Bluegrass with Celtic folk music, Insane! I ordered this DVD with TS4 DVD. Today I still don't know which DVD is better! You will get ~3h of great music (47 songs) recorded in good quality. Although the quality of sound is very good, I would like to have lossless sound format in next releases like DTS-HD or Dolby-TrueHD.

For those of you who bought this DVD with wrong format PAL/NTSC, I suggest that you copy DVD to your PC and view it with some of today popular media players.",1348099200,9,631,4.535087719298246
5114103,5,B007XF0WMG,"All of the performers for these sessions were hand picked by Aly Bain and Jerry Douglas and that alone should be enough to get you interested.

 I'll admit that I didn't recognize a lot of the names at first but rest assured that I'll be watching for them in the future. Every word of vocals and every note from the instruments was a joy to hear. Simply amazing stuff.  You seldom get to see this many A-list musicians brought together to record even one song together and with this DVD set you get almost 50 songs. The video production and sound quality are up to the task and taken as a whole this is simply an awesome collection. It probably won't leave my DVD player for months to come.

 A previous reviewer seemed slightly underwhelmed with Sarah Jarosz but I disagree. She makes up for in talent what she may lack in experience (due simply to her youth). Her vocals were a highlight for me. Considering that she was invited to participate tells me that Aly and Jerry also like what they hear. Two of her songs (she composed them) ""Annabel Lee"" and ""Run Away"" are among my favorites. From what I've seen there are no weak links in this series.

 Why are you still reading this?  You should be clicking on the ""add to cart"" button. Now.",1345075200,14,1241,4.412280701754386
