8199488,1,B000R92YAI,"I ordered some old shows about 4 years ago to listen to when I travel and really enjoyed them.  I ordered this to listen to while traveling but it will only play on a computer.  Hopefully my son or grandson will be able to copy it to CD so I can listen to it otherwise it is a total waste of money.  If I wanted to listen to something on the computer I can use youtube free.  Had the statement on the back of the holder, ""This DVD contains a collection of Old Time Radio favorites in MP3 format.  It is designed to be played on the DVD player in your compiuter."", been in the amazon description I would not have ordered it.",1508803200,,623,4.032520325203252

8199492,5,B000R92YAI,"I'm too young to have experienced these wonderful radio shows when they were live, which is a shame.

However, this collection at under $20 for 761 shows is pretty amazing.

If you like old radio shows, and want to catch up with what previous generations enjoyed, this is a good way to do it.

I love that they include the old ads, too.",1350777600,,336,4.301587301587301
8199493,5,B000R92YAI,"...that this is NOT a video in the sense that we have come to expect from DVD. This is a compilation of audios from Fibber and Molly.
Having said that, I was thrilled to find that there was a collection available and they are FUNNY !!
Not the silly nonsensical far fetched attempts to keep you watching current TV sitcoms but clever use and abuse of the King's English.
Highly recommended if you enjoy language skills.",1308700800,7,418,4.5131578947368425
8199494,5,B000R92YAI,"I'm relatively new to listening to radio programs, but I thoroughly enjoyed those I have listened to.  There are so many packed on this cd/dvd.  If you know of someone that you want to introduce to radio programs, this would be a great one to start with.  Fibber and Molly are hilarious!  I love it and will be looking for more radio shows in the future.  I was amazed and the great storytelling coming from a generation that only watched TV.  I wasn't bord for a second. I'm sold!",1293926400,2,481,4.348314606741573
