7793252,4,0874809878,This is a very bland review of the Joe Hill case by Salt Lake City public television.  The most interesting thing about it is that it does discuss the issue of Frank Z. Wilson and compares Wilson and Hill.  It is short on historical photographs which is a major shortcoming.,1340064000,,274,4.46
7793253,1,0874809878,What kind of a documentary about a musician does not feature any songs by the musician in it? Watching this was frustrating.,1338422400,,124,4.681818181818182
7793254,1,0874809878,Beware!  This is not the feature length movie.  This is a crappy PBS documentary.  And it's as much about the labor movement in general as it is specifically about Hill.  This is not worth watching.,1323043200,2,198,4.571428571428571
