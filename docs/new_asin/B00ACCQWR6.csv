He knows the territory totally, and how to present it so you can get it. Its really not for beginners,  I would say its more for someone with intermediate skills plus and advance beginners that are motivated. Hey the great part of having the DVD you aren't on the clock and so you can repeat it at will. The songs can be strummed as there are words and chords sheet for each song. So for instance, you can grab some of the finger style stuff and mix it with strumming the chords to keep your interest until you have it.  There is enough good video views,  He performs the song at first then breaks the playing down split screen shots of strumming and fingerboard action with his narration, his rational for what he is doing, on finger placement, song layout, and some music theory.  Me, I listen to his performance then look at the tabs to get myself oriented. Then go back an forth watching, listening and looking at the song tab. Then I get into getting the rhythm then add more complexity to my playing the song until I have it. Also, I like at times to change things because it matches where I am at musically at the time or my skill level.  What I do may not serve you so go with what works for you. Having fun is what its all about in the end and when you are having fun your audience will be having fun, even if the audience is just the dog and you. LOL!",1406246400,,1495,4.261484098939929

The songs are all (but one) a lot of fun to play and appropriately slighted just enough in double entendre to play for anyone, including kids.  The lesson is for late beginner, Intermediate, and is well shot and constructed.  The songs are interesting enough to play without singing, and the camera work is what we have come to expect from Grossman's productions:  great camera angles, close ups, split screens, and wide angles.  It is well taught, with songs well chosen, and is a lot of fun to play.  ***** stars for great instruction, song selection and camera work.",1359244800,,616,4.719626168224299
