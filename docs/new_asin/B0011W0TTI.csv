8242784,5,B0011W0TTI,"I would recommend this for people who have experience with the concepts, but want to understand them more deeply than in the surface, ""just memorize these steps"" kind of way. Excellent, just what I hoped for when I ordered it.",1322438400,2,226,4.675
8242785,4,B0011W0TTI,"My high-school aged daughter had completed Algebra I and II via Videotext but needed some reinforcement.  She thought the video was okay (quite a bit of sport references and she's not a sports fan).  She did manage to gain a better understanding of algebra II and is now working on geometry through another series called Life of Fred  (she was tired of videos and wanted to return to textbooks).  This video is definitely dated but the teacher is quite good.  Dr. Siegel emphasizes understanding how you solve a problem and not just memorizing formulas.  He breaks the problem down to the basics and explains the ""why"" behind each step.  His Basic Math video helped my younger child learn  elementary math concepts--it's billed as a refresher arithmetic course in preparation for algebra I but works great as an upper elementary course.",1255392000,5,836,4.921428571428572
