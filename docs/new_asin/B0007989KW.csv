8046167,1,B0007989KW,"Also known as ""Ain't No Way Back."" Two guys go hunting, one is a city boy. They meet some moonshiners bothering a girl and get involved and their butts handed to them. In fact  if you want to know exactly what the film is about read the back of the DVD cover for the plot spoiler. The film was basically boring without life.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1424390400,,358,4.173913043478261
8046168,5,B0007989KW,"I was pleasantly drawn in to the story. The movie has recognizable actors, which is great. It isn't the type of movie you'd expect from a Troma film. But it a way, it is... Campbell Scott is major hot in this movie too, and gives a great performance.  He was my eye candy through the whole movie. It's definitely going to be added to my list of, ""curl up on the couch with a glass of red wine"", movies that I will probably watch regularly.! :-)",1408665600,2,444,4.162790697674419
8046169,1,B0007989KW,"This picture was poorly acted, a poor script and poor directions.  I am a big fan of Campbell Scott, but was terribly disappointed with the movie. Although Campbell did a credible job with what he had, the movie was bad.",1259884800,,220,4.5
8046170,4,B0007989KW,"Sort of like Brigadoon meets the Hatfields & McCoys...  This is a ghost story and a romance story wrapped up in one.  As nicely written and directed as any grade B movie, this is a must-have for any Campbell Scott fan, as it is probably his first starring role, released right before Longtime Companion.",1198713600,2,303,4.592592592592593
