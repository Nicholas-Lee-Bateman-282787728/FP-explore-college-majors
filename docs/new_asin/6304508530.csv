900268,5,6304508530,"Review of ""Irma la Douce""
Hot Toasty Rag, June 26, 2017

Anyone who liked The Apartment will love to see Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine paired up again in Irma la Douce. As a kid, I saw this one much more often than their black-and-white counterpart. I loved the colors and fashions, and I remember wishing I would grow up and naturally sport Shirleys adorable haircut.

In Irma la Douce, Shirley plays a streetwalker, and Jack plays a policeman. A match made in heaven! In Paris, the red light district is a very corrupt place, and all the cops usually look the other way. Not Jack Lemmon! Hes a very moral guy, and after he gets fired from the force, he tries to convince her to quit her job. Shes a very experienced and successful prostitute, and without her income, theyll have no bread and butter. Whats the young couple to do?

I know it doesnt really sound like a very funny plot on paper, but its quite hilarious. A lovely screwball sex comedy of the 1960s without showing anything inappropriate, Irma la Douce is a total classic. Watch it for the jokes, watch it for Shirleys darling look, or watch it for the inventive plot. Just watch it!",1498435200,,1151,4.497607655502392

900321,5,6304508530,"Another great, relaxed, funny movie from Billy Wilder, and the 1960s. Jack Lemon plays a perfect Paris policeman who arrests and then falls in love with Shirley McClaine, a prostitute called Irma the Sweet. Lemon becomes jealous of other men and poses as a rich English Lord X who gives her enough money that he becomes er only client. How he gets the money is hilarious. Lou Jacobi plays a priceless role of the wise bar tender.

My wife and I saw the movie when it came out. It stands up very well. There is something of Shakespearean comedy in Wilder's work, usually involving role reversal, contra-societal morality, and a down to earth carefree approach to life. It is great fun in about two hours.",1458000000,,703,4.624

900421,2,6304508530,"It's too long. too loud and not nearly funny enough to sustain the length. One of the problems is that although all the mediocre songs were dropped  from the original show, to create something quite different to the source - it still looks and feels like a musical. The costumes, the sets and the hysterical overacting feels like the heightened world of a musical farce. So you're expecting people to sing and dance, and they don't. It's amusing enough, but there's a synthetic, shrill feel to it which wears very thin very quickly.",1427155200,,532,4.720430107526882

900550,1,6304508530,"The original ""Irma la Douce"" was a frothy Broadway musical, full of Gallic charm. For the movie, the songs have been removed and the plot altered slightly and we are left with a lengthy lumbering unfunny comedy. Shirley Maclaine has become a chain smoking whore and lost that real spark of innocence the musical Irma had. Jack Lemmon is good as Nestor/Lord X but none of the scenes ever reach true comic proportions. The film is nice to look at in a widescreen presentation, but this Paris is definitely a Hollywood set. Some of the original music has been used as background pieces adding a touch of lightness to this heavy handed albatross of a comedy. Completely off track is the use of the ""Dis-Donc"" number for a twist dance sequence. How much more un-Parasian can you get? Not sorry I bought it since I didn't expext much. I didn't get much either.",1394582400,,854,4.588235294117647

900552,4,6304508530,"The story is very nice and happens in an ancient street of Paris. Good film of the 60's, there are no stories like this nowadays. High quality of performences by the main actors. Nevertheless, in the backcover of the case is written ""NTSC"" and this is not true !!!
Beware, the playing system is PAL, I mean European sytem for reproduction. I bought this DVD as a present for my mother but it was impossible to watch. Thanks to a multiregion videoplayer for watching PAL movies comming from Europe was possible to reproduce this DVD made in USA. It would be necessary to correct the actual legend NTSC for PAL in the backcover.",1391817600,,626,4.548672566371682
900553,5,6304508530,one of my favorite comedies. it could not be made today. it's essentially a movie about a pimp in love with his prostitute. jack lemmon and shirley macclaine are both excellent. lemmon starts out as an honest cop who gets thrown off the force. he set his cap on a bar stool prompting the pimps to drop protection money in the hat. lemmon then busts everybody and puts the hat on his head. when in front of his boss he's told to take the hat off as the money falls to the floor he's dismissed. lemmon returns to the bar. he becomes the top pimp by beating the reigning boss when he crams a cue ball into the lout's mouth. his reward is mcclain. but he can't stand the thought of anyone else being with her. so he invents an alterego who buys all of her time. but he has to get a real job to pay her. Along the way he gets tried for murdering the alterego. a top cast and great music.,1391472000,,882,4.074712643678161

What a boondoggle? Next time I order anything from AMAZON I will have to read all the small prints and BS. I ordered several other DVDs together with this one and this one was an expensive dud. Never again. There was no way to contact anybody to return it so it is resting somewhere or may be I threw it away.

It requires suspension of disbelief, because although it is set in Paris, everyone in the movie speaks perfect English instead of French.  Inspector Patou (played by Lemmon) also makes some harebrained decisions, but I suppose that's necessary in order to move the plot along.",1378857600,,407,5.151515151515151

Really well done and star studded cast--just a BIT long.  Several scenes that could be cut in half time-wise...

900785,2,6304508530,"I don't recall if I saw this when it came out.  I probably did because I loved Paris, Shirley MacLaine and Billy Wilder.  What a difference a half-century makes.

When I watched it now I was terribly disappointed.  The Jack Lemmon character was silly, the whole premise was naive and it just didn't grab me.  I hate to say it but I was also offended by the old timey view of prostitutes as good-time girls who really loved their work.  I'm not politically correct or even much of a feminist, but I found portraying prostitutes in this way really offensice.  There is nothing funny or entertaining or cute about prostitution and the women who endure this terribly degrading 'profession"" sure don't look like Shirly MacLaine.  I turned it off after about 20 minutes.  Maybe it got better?  I'll never know. I probably did see this and enjoy it fifty years ago; I know better now.",1329523200,,877,4.6
900786,1,6304508530,"This is one of Shirley's least appealing movies.  She looks great, like she always does, but the plot is very thin, the jokes are lame, and the movie is more than predictable.  Lou Jacobi does a great job as the bartender, but he can't carry this thing, and Shirley hasn't enough of a part to make much of a difference.  It falls to Jack Lemmon to redeem the effort, and although he starts off strong, he ultimately drops the ball.  In addition, the DVD is ridiculously expensive.  Save your money for something more worthwhile.",1325894400,,528,4.574468085106383

900837,5,6304508530,"Yet another Billy Wilder smash hit, `Irma La Douce' pits the wonderfully charming Shirley MacLaine against the hilariously witty Jack Lemmon in a comedy that is every bit as smart as it is unforgettable.  This is one of those comedies that sneaks up on you, getting better and better as the film progresses onward to its end, and then the ending is one that takes you for a loop and makes you reevaluate your whole understanding of the film.

It's just wonderfully constructed from beginning to end.

The film tells the story of Nestor Patou, a policeman in Paris who happens to take the law seriously.  Unluckily for Nestor, he's the only law-abiding citizen in his district, and when his clean and polished ways rub the police chief the wrong way he finds himself without a job.  After a chance encounter with a young street walker named Irma and her pimp leaves him the talk of the town though, Nestor finds that the law may not be his friend, but his new life seems to fit him just perfect.  That is until his emotional attachment to Irma gets in the way of her line of work, and soon he finds himself battling with her every step of the way.

`Irma La Douce' is a genuine comedy that is sweet and engaging despite its questionable subject matter.  This is never played in a perverse way but used as light fun for the audience.  As we watch Nestor try his hardest to keep Irma from `working' we fall in love with his efforts, for his care for her is genuine and sincere.  As we watch their relationship totter because of his loving deceit we feel for them both because we want them to stay together.

The acting is superb here, especially on the parts of the two leads.  Lemmon and MacLaine have proven they are outstanding together (just watch them melt together in Wilder's equally marvelous `The Apartment') and here they take that chemistry to new heights, finding a beautiful balance between adoration and commitment.  This is seen in the wonderful scenes with Irma and Lord X (Nestor's alter ego).  There is such warmth present in those scenes as we witness Irma and Nestor growing closer by means of a medium.

This is not Wilder's best work, but it is yet another slam dunk in my opinion.  It's witty and fresh (thank god they cut the stage musicals singing routines) and it is entertaining to the very end.  It will leave you guessing and keep you hooked, and in the end will have you wanting to take the ride all over again.",1221523200,,2438,4.504545454545455
900838,4,6304508530,"One character in ""Irma La Douce"" describes the love between Jack Lemmon's sad sack and Shirley MacLaine's heart-of-gold streetwalker as ""cute"".  Herein lies my problem with the film.  I liked it, though it was a little overlong, but I was expecting something a little edgier from director Billy Wilder and his co-scenarist I.A.L. Diamond.  Maybe it has something to do with the fact that they were adapting someone else's work instead of creating something original.  Lemmon and MacLaine still have that distinct chemistry but it's not as apparent as it was in Wilder's masterwork, ""The Apartment"".  One pronounced credit to the film is the hilarious turn by Lou Jacobi as Moustache, Lemmon's mentor and dispenser of advise.  Not a bad film but I would behoove you to check out Jules Dassin's ""Never on Sunday"" with Melina Mercouri which covers similar territory as ""Irma La Douce"" but with infinitely better results.",1212710400,,917,5.08

900876,5,6304508530,"Billy Wilder's 1963 adaptation of the successful stage musical IRMA LA DOUCE still makes for an entertaining movie experience.  Shirley MacLaine is simply perfect for the title role with Jack Lemmon absolutely hilarious as her comical suitor.

Irma la Douce (Shirley MacLaine) plies her trade on the Rue Casanova of Paris with her fellow lovelies (with such names as Lolita, Amazon Annie, Mimi the MauMau and Suzette Wong).  Into Irma's life comes the noble and honest policeman Nestor (Jack Lemmon) who is soon kicked off the job because he refuses to take bribes and compromise his own conscience.  Nestor goes to live with Irma as her `business manager' but wants her to give up her profession, so he `invents' the filthy-rich Lord X to become her sole client, and takes a night-job to help the shortfall.  All manner of hilarious complications ensue as Nestor's double life soon begins to spin out of control!

Based on the successful stage musical (music by Marguerite Monnot, lyrics by Alexandre Breffort), IRMA LA DOUCE was re-tooled by Wilder as a straight comedy piece.  It works quite well either way, though I must confess that as an admirer of the stage play, it would have been smashing for Shirley MacLaine to perform that gorgeous score.  The movie does retain the jaunty ""Dis-donc, Dis-donc"" and Andre Previn's score makes good use out of Monnot's music, particularly ""Our Language of Love"".

The strong cast also includes Lou Jacobi as the owner of the Bistro Moustache, Bruce Yarnell as Irma's previous manager Hippolyte and Billy Wilder stalwart Joan Shawlee as Amazon Annie.

The evocative costumes were designed by Orry-Kelly and the unbilled narrator at the beginning of the film is none other than Louis Jourdan.  Shirley MacLaine was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance here and the movie itself was one of the year's top-grossers.

The DVD presents the movie in a nicely-letterboxed 16:9 print.  Colours are full and rich and the soundtrack is stridant in 2-channel stereo.  The only extra is the original trailer.",1115078400,,2054,5.020648967551622
900877,3,6304508530,"Irma La Douce is a curious film with a curious history. Originally a French musical, it was translated and tranferred to Broadway where it was a modest success. Hollywood liked the play's premise but not its songs so, when Billy Wilder came to make the film version, all the songs were dropped and it was done as a comedy (although some of the music was reworked by Andre Previn as themes for his background score).

The story is the stuff of farce. Jack Lemmon is a too honest policeman who gets fired for being overly zealous. He promptly falls in love with the cause of his misfortune - a prostitute played by Shirley MacLaine. Almost by accident, Lemmon becomes her pimp but he is so in love with her that he resents her clients. So he devises a scheme in which he impersonates a rich English lord who buys all of Irma's time. To pay for this, Lemmon must work all day while MacLaine sleeps. Before long, crazy with exhaustion and jealous of himself, he decides to do away with his alter ego. At which point he is arrested for the murder of someone who does not exist.

Amazingly, the film is not as funny as it might sound. Or, at least, it's not as funny as it might have been forty years ago. When it was released, Irma La Douce was quite a racy film. But now it seems rather tame and almost naive. And at nearly two and a half hours, there seems to be quite long gaps between highlights. It is probably a sacrilege to suggest Billy Wilder was slightly lacking his trademark golden touch. But much of the style and pacing of the film seems uncertain. The colors are so garish and unreal that you wonder if black and white might have suited the material better. The main sets are obvious sound stages yet the camera occasionally wanders into realistic locations, further confusing the look of the movie. And some more editing would have helped the film's pace.

Even so, there are a number of fun moments. Lemmon is always watchable, especially in the days before he began to take himself too seriously. His character of Nestor is right up there with some of his best. But his impersonation of the English lord is so broad and such a caricature that it blunts the intended humor. As Irma, Shirley MacLaine is bubbly and strangely sexy - just as she was in a whole series of silly films in the Sixties. Legend has it that she researched her role by hanging out with real Parisian prostitutes. She needn't have bothered as her Irma is the typical Hollywood tart with a heart of gold. The supporting cast - especially the girls - do their bits well enough. Trivia lovers will enjoy spotting a pre-Incredible Hulk Bill Bixby as a French sailor. Lou Jacobi, as the owner of the local bistro, gets most of the film's best lines. But that's another story...

Irma La Douce is an enjoyable enough comedy but everyone involved has done better work elsewhere. Still, it's a lot better than most of the more modern and allegedly more sophisticated ""romantic comedies"" made these days.",1093996800,,2979,4.521335807050093

There's one big difference, though. ""The Apartment"" has been justly acclaimed as a masterpiece of cinema, but despite what critics have written about it, it is NOT a 'romantic comedy.' It's a drama. A poignant love story with a happy ending.

This doesn't need to be confusing. Actually it is a delightful movie with two of my favorite actors, Shirley and Jack. Both with exceptional talent from the stage and now adapting this to a non-musical musical romantic comedy. While you hear the background music in this great film you will almost hear the beautiful words being sung with the chemistry that these two actors portray. This comedy duel soon changes to more serious acting as the story progresses and you find yourself just as much in love as they are with each other.  Billy Wilder as the director had visions for this story way beyond any director of today. This guy knows how to direct and the challenges that he had in this film in keeping with the story without the singing voices only shows that he is the ""Master"" of all directors.",1028246400,,976,4.674418604651163
900880,3,6304508530,"Many might want to compare this film to Wilder's earlier Oscar winning film, ""The Apartment"" which also starred Lemmon and Maclaine. This time the two are in the red-light district in Paris. Maclaine plays Irma, aka Irma La Douce (meaning Irma the sweet) and Lemmon as an honest cop Nester Patou. As soon as Nester (Lemmon) sets his eyes on Irma he's taken away by her,but, he doesn't realize she's a ""working girl"". After being fired off the force for a hotel raid and arresting the chief of police Nester depressed walks into a bar owned by Lou Jacobi who play Moustache. Noticing that Irma's pimp is acting rough with her Nester decides to defend her by getting beat up by her pimp lol. Finally Nester gets the best of him, and finds that now he is Irma's new pimp. Nester finds that he has also fallen in love with her and doesn't want her to be with other men. He then gets a great idea that will enable her to only be with him. As one might expect since the two worked with each other 3 years earlier there is good timing between Lemmon and Maclaine. And Billy Wilder is in fine form. There are some great moment here, especially in the begining when we see Irma conning men into giving her a big tip. And the scenes with Jacobi and Lemmon are very funny as well. The film is based on Alexandre Breffort's play and was written for screen by I.A.L Diamond and Wilder himself. The movie was nominated for 3 Oscars; Best Actress, Cinematograpgy, and Music score.
