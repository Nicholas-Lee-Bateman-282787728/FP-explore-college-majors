8071883,5,B000A16I32,"My love of this ballet stretches back to an art history class I was required to take at West Chester State in 1963. Mrs. Ring was over the moon about this, and fortunately the Pennsylvania Ballet was performing it. Seeing this ballet was a jaw dropping experience. The music by Tchaikovsky is out of this world. It is extremely well performed and well rendered by the Bolshoi Orchestra. I have seen several performances of this ballet, and I had concluded that no ballet company could match the fantastic nature of the score. I was wrong!

The dancing in this production is peerless in every regard. I often felt that the choreography of Petipa was awkward, labored and stolid. However, the dancers of the Bolshoi animate it with remarkable agility and grace that reveal its vital artistry. Aruora (Nina Semizorova) is simply fabulous. Her movements are unforced, elegant and captivating. Her acting (pantomime) is extremely compelling, especially her collapse after pricking herself with the poisoned needle.  Aleksei Fadeyechev is spine-tingling as Prince Desire. There was never a more handsome, accomplished and powerful prince! They were perfect partners. The Lilac Fairy pulls the story together and is spectacularly performed by Nina Speranskaya. Yuri Vetrov's rendition of Carabosse is at once menacing and humorous. He breathes real life into this character. Other male dancers have performed this role and Vetrov almost steals the show. The principal dancers are all spectacular as is the corps de ballet. I like this live performance before an audience that clearly knows its ballet and rewards the dancers with heat-felt adulation.

Ballets were meant to be seen from a fixed position in the audience. All ballet films I have seen suffer from extreme close-ups and off-angle shots. These are designed to add dynamic viewing elements which rarely work and are usually detrimental, especially for ensemble dancing. Ballet make-up was not designed for extreme close-ups. This film suffers from some of this but not as much as others I have seen. However, the distance shots of the entire stage are low resolution, and thus, closer views of the dancers are welcome in this production.

I could offer more nitpicking criticisms but the overall effect of this performance was delightful, especially the dancing of  Nina Semizorova.

Thank you Mrs. Ring, and the state of Pennsylvania!",1385424000,,2390,5.194805194805195
8071884,5,B000A16I32,"The best DVD version of sleeping beauty available hands down! I'm not saying it's perfect, but it's one that you need to own if you love this ballet. Yuri Vetrov as Caribosse is perfect and I think choosing a man for the role was a wise choice. I can't enjoy anyone else in the role because he was so brilliant in this role.",1358640000,,324,4.158730158730159
8071885,5,B000A16I32,"It's a wonderful production of Sleeping Beauty. Fadeyechev and the Lilac fairy were a pleasure to watch. Magnificent! I would have rated this particular Sleeping Beauty as my favorite, except that I absoulutely disliked Semizorova as Aurora. Her technique is flowless but her acting leaves a lot to be desired, acting more like ""Odile"" than the young innocent Aurora. Nevertheless, this DVD is worth having, since you can overlook Semizorova interpretative shortcomings and enjoy, not only her dancing, but the rest of the ballet, which is outstanding. So, I gave it 5 stars.",1300060800,6,575,5.193548387096774
8071886,5,B000A16I32,"So what does an appliance repairman know about ballet? The girls all run around in tutus, don't they? I loved classical music long before I learned to love washers and dryers, or ballet for that matter. I've only been collecting them for less than six months but fell in love with the art form when I got a copy of ""Sleeping Beauty"" by the Australian Ballet Company with Christine Walsh and David Ashmole.
 This performance of ""Sleeping Beauty"" is not the best one I have (I have five versions) but it is a good one. The music sounds good, the sets are fair, and the lighting is OK. The moving scene in front of and behind the Lilac Fairy's boat when she and the Prince were on their journey to find Sleeping Beauty was impressive. I did not like Carabosse. I like a woman in that role. After all, it is a woman's role, and in all the versions I have, a woman fits the part better. Nina Semizorova doesn't fit the role of a sixteen year old happy, flighty, full of vitality girl, especially in a 1930ish style hairdo. I know I am not supposed to look at the age characteristics of a ballerina, but I am not the the only one who does. In every review on The Sleeping Beauty with Margot Fonteyn and Nureyev, the reviewer commented on the close-ups on Fonteyn showing her wrinkles.
This is the first ""Sleeping Beauty"" I've seen that shows the extent to which the King went to ban needles of all sorts from his kingdom.
This copy of the ballet is worth owning but for the very best look for the Het National Ballet version with Sofiane Sylve and Gael Lambiotte.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tchaikovsky-The-Sleeping-Beauty-Sylve-Lambiotte-Florio-Dutch-National-Ballet-Amsterdam/dp/B00030EQUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tchaikovsky - The Sleeping Beauty / Sylve, Lambiotte, Florio, Dutch National Ballet, Amsterdam</a>",1215993600,17,1853,5.075409836065574
8071887,5,B000A16I32,"I have waited so long to find a copy of The Bolshoi at the Bolshoi series version of 'The Sleeping Beauty' that I am blind to the faults that Marc points out in his review.  (Most of the rest I have as videos.)

I enjoyed it thorougly.  The choices of A. Vetrov as the Bluebird (if you like him, look for 'Swan Lake' and 'Romeo and Juliet' from the same series), and Y. Vetrov as Carabosse were so appropriate.

I cannot top what Marc said about Fadeyechev as Prince Desire.

[It was Marc who told me that the DVD was out.]",1146441600,23,523,4.138613861386139
