8254239,4,B00144CP72,"This film is a fairly faithful version of the novel by Catalan novelist Merce Rodoreda. Since the action takes place during the years of the Spanish Second Republic, Civil War and postwar period and dictatorship (from about 1930's to 1950's), it gives a good overview of the historical circumstances taking place in Barcelona (and Catalonia) during that time. The movie is kind of ""artsy"", not much dialog (most of it is narrated in interior monologue by the protagonist), and a bit slow. However, overall it is a good testimony of the impact of the war and the hardships of those on the losing side whose cultural identity was threaten by the regime.
The movie was filmed in Catalan and then dubbed into Spanish. It may be a bit difficult to hear/understand even, since the sound quality is not the best and there is no captions.",1370995200,,830,4.731034482758621
