When I watched it, I was shocked at how beautiful it is, the characterisation is so good, you'll be thinking about these characters even days after you have watched the movie.

The story revolves around a bunch of carnal, self-centered, agressive, plotting, politicians and the people around them, and then throws a completely innocent man who has been out of the society for 25 years in with them, and allows the ingredients to produce whatever they will... That said, this movie is not typical Hindi movie with heroes and villains, rather showing all sides of each person, good and bad.

Mohan Joshi is Mohan, who pays for the treatment of Anirudh (Nana Patekar), who was mentally destabilised at eleven years old after both his parents dies. Mohan secretly wants to snatch away Anirudh's inheretence and properties.

Jackie Shroff is Ranjan, the restless, spoilt brat son of a politician. He plays this part so well, whenever he comes on screen some drama or action takes place; gunfights, smashing expensive vases, affairs, poker tricks... he lights up the screen.

Whoever the director was he bought out the best in everybody, I have never been a fan of Manihsa Koirala... but she's absolutely on fire in this movie! In society Sunita (MK) is known as a mistress to the heartless politician Paresh (no relation to the other 'Paresh'). It's only Anirudh who can see inside her soul. Ranjan, however, 'buys' Sunita, because actually he loves her, but his way of showing doesn't endear him to her. On top of a couple of scorching love triangles is political chicanery and brilliant acting all round (Evil Monish could have been used more) and you're in for a brilliant movie.",1379289600,,1759,4.85
