I think that is ridiculous, it is always room for a well done updated  version if it is well done and this movie is, it has a great cast,good story line and music score. I glad it finally came out on DVD.",1341360000,,369,3.8552631578947367

Bing Crosby is great and Ann Margaret is beautiful as always. This film is well worth watching and owning. Hurry and grab the last one or you will be sorry.",1330819200,6,323,4.225806451612903
4894395,4,B005UO1CLM,"First of all, don't make the mistake of trying to compare this version with the 1939 classic! The 1966 film can stand on it's own merits as a thoroughly enjoyable western, with the added advantage of colour and wide screen photography! Alex Cord may not have the looks or charisma of John Wayne, but he's adequate in the role, and the experience of the all-star cast make up for any shortcomings! The great Bing Crosby easily steals the acting honours as the drunken Doc Boone in his last big screen role, and fine performances by the likes of other veterans like Robert Cummings, Van Heflin and Slim Pickens and others all add the the fun! Any one who likes a good solid western will enjoy this film, just don't expect Bing to swing out with one of his old western hits, and you won't be disappointed!",1325808000,8,802,4.5
4894396,5,B005UO1CLM,"I saw this film with my father in the movies when I was 16 and greatly enjoyed it.  For years I wondered why it had never been released on VHS or DVD.  I especially wondered when another terrific 20th. Century Fox western ""Rio Conchos"" was released earlier in the year and partnered with a mediocrity like ""Take A Hard Ride.""
Well anyway it is finally here in a release limited to 3000.  This film was released in the summer of 1966 and was both a critical and financial failure.  The main problem seems to be simply that it is not the John Ford ""Stagecoach"" and has been maligned unfairly as a result.  Filmed in color in beautiful Colorado, this film has plenty of action and an indian attack sequence near the end that goes on forever.  The film has a terrific cast including the beautiful Ann-Margaret as the saloon girl Dallas, Bing Crosby excellent as the alcoholic Doc Boone and Michael Connors, 1 year before ""Mannix,"" as the Southern gambler Hatfield.  Red Buttons as the whiskey salesman whose wares Crosby keeps sampling and the great Slim Pickens as whiny stagecoach driver Buck.  The rest of the cast includes Van Heflin as the Marshal, Curley and Bob Cummings, slimy and obnoxious as the embezzling banker Gatewood.  Stefanie Powers is the pregnant cavalry Captain's wife, protected by Connors.  (I was lucky enough to meet Miss Powers and Ann-Margret a few years ago at a Chiller Theatre in New Jersey and had them sign a poster, with that wonderful Norman Rockwell artwork, of this film that I own.)Keenan Wynn makes a small appearance at the end as the absolutely evil Luke Plummer, the man the Ringo kid has come to kill.
And speaking of the Ringo kid, theres Alex Cord in the role that made the legendary John Wayne a star.  Look, Cord is obviously no Duke, not many are.  As a matter of fact, the Duke has been gone since 1979 and still no one has replaced him and probably no one ever will.  However Cord is fine on his own in the film.
As stated the film is in color and has plenty of action and beautiful scenery.  The picture quality on the DVD is great.  There are no extra features except an isolated audio score of the fantastic Jerry Goldsmith music.
In conclusion, I have waited for this one on DVD for years and was not disappointed.  If you are thinking about it, I would grab a copy before the 3000 are sold out.",1320796800,31,2344,4.492924528301887
4894397,5,B005UO1CLM,"Movie is filled with history of the BEST actors ever!
Some might feel Ann-Margret wasn't right for the part but I beg to differ!
The role of ""Dallas"" is to be SEXY, Ann-Margret is beyond that for sure!

Been waiting years for this movie on VHS & it never happan...
Thrilled to see it released on DVD & especially this high anamorphic quality!

Thanks to Twilight for releasing this movie...I'm thrilled!

Why are 200 people writing reviews for 1939 with John Wayne this listing is 1966 nothing to do with JW.",1319414400,13,508,4.56043956043956
4894398,4,B005UO1CLM,"A disparate group of passengers are thrown together by circumstances on a stagecoach traveling through Sioux territory making their way to Cheyenne. If John Ford's 1939 masterwork STAGECOACH had never existed, this film would be seen as an above average exciting western. But when you're a remake of one of the great American films of all time, it's near impossible to stand on your own without being compared. Of course, a film like this, despite some genuine virtues, is going to suffer under comparisons. As it is, it's a solid western with colorful characters traveling amid the glorious Colorado mountains majestically lensed in CinemaScope by William Clothier (MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE). The film, not surprisingly considering the almost 30 years that have passed, is more violent. It opens with a soldier getting a tomahawk to the face, a man being dragged through fire and a horse stomping a solider to death. Some of the casting is off. Ann-Margret, in particular, with her Sydney Guilaroff hairstyles and anachronistic false fingernails is simply too young for the role of the prostitute Dallas and Robert Cummings, who normally can barely make an effort to act, overacts terribly. Directed by Gordon Douglas, music by Jerry Goldsmith. With Bing Crosby (very good), Van Heflin, Stefanie Powers, Red Buttons, Michael Connors, Slim Pickens, Keenan Wynn and in the role that made John Wayne a star, Alex Cord.

The Twilight Time DVD is a superb anamorphic wide screen (2.35) transfer.",1318982400,20,1495,5.127049180327869
4894399,2,B005UO1CLM,"This could be considered a duel review. If you have seen the John Wayne original, I don't see how anyone would like this remake. None of the acting stands up to the original at all & there is virtually no background scenery of any kind. You cannot compete with John Ford. That said, if this is your first viewing of this movie & you never saw the original, I could see how you could enjoy the show for what it is. If you are a western lover, ignore this film & stick to the original. You will never regret it. I personally could not finish this remake. I tried but just could not stay interested.

4894404,5,B005UO1CLM,"I can't even count how many times I saw this movie back in the days when it appeared regularly on cable.  In some ways it's actually superior to the 1939 original (I'll get to that presently).  Sometime around 1875, in the settlement of Dry Fork, a pair of soldiers kill each other over the saloon girl known only as Dallas (Ann-Margret), and their outraged captain (John Gabriel) warns the bar owner (Hal Lynch) to ""get rid of your undesirable element or the Army will do it for you.""  Dallas and the alcoholic Dr. Josiah Boone (Bing Crosby) correctly interpret this as referring to themselves, and board the next day's stage for Cheyenne, on which they find Lucy Mallory (Stephanie Powers), a Cavalry captain's very pregnant wife en route to join her husband, and a whiskey drummer (Red Buttons) with a severe head cold.  They are soon joined by bank cashier Henry Gatewood (Robert Cummings), who has just filched $10,000 from his father-in-law's bank, and a Southern gambler called Hatfield (Michael Connors), who has recognized Lucy as the daughter of his former colonel and resolved to ""offer his protection"" to her.  Stage driver Buck (Slim Pickens), finding that his scheduled shotgun guard is off with a posse trying to run down the Ringo Kid, takes on Marshal Curly Wilcox (Van Heflin) in his place when Curly finds out that the Kid, who recently broke out of the penitentiary, may well be on his way to Cheyenne instead of Abilene as generally supposed.  Not far along the road, the Kid himself (Alex Cord), set afoot by a lamed horse, flags them down and finds himself under arrest, but doesn't resist: Luke Plummer (Keenan Wynn), the man he has sworn to kill, is in Cheyenne, as Buck knew, and Ringo means to get there one way or another.  Adding to the many tensions raised by the clash of human personalities and motives--Gatewood is wild to get to Cheyenne and out the other side with his money before the bank reopens on Monday, while Peacock is eager to ""rejoin the bosom of my family"" (wife and eight children) in St. Louis, but not so eager to get killed in the process--is the word that Crazy Horse is out with a large war party somewhere between Dry Fork and Cheyenne, and so he proves to be: Billy Pickett (David Humphreys Miller), who keeps the first relay station out of Dry Fork, has resolved to evacuate himself and his family out of harm's way, and when the coach reaches the Horseshoe Bend facility, it turns out that the Indians have attacked the place and massacred a detachment of troops that had paused there.  The shock sends Lucy into labor, while Dallas and Ringo--the former something of an embittered cynic, the latter possessed of old-fashioned cow-country chivalry--discover a mutual attraction.  With Cheyenne nearly in sight, the Indians appear, and when the coach loses a wheel, the nine travellers must fight for their lives.  And all the while Plummer and his sons (Brad Weston, Ned Wynn) are waiting...

Moving the setting from early-1880's New Mexico to mid-70's Wyoming allows the incorporation of the famous ""Deadwood stage,"" and apart from the advantages of Technicolor, the often dark and forest-y setting adds a note of suspense to the story; the crossing of Laramie Ridge by night in a pouring rain, which has no parallel in the original version, provides an extra level of peril.  All the characters seem to suit their roles particularly well, and the motif of Dallas's having been the focus of a fatal argument gives, to my mind, a much better reason for her banishment than in the 1939 version, whose ""Ladies' League"" seems to rather arbitrarily select Claire Trevor's version of the character for ejection when there must have been quite a few of the same kind of ""bad girl"" in town.  Crosby as Doc Boone, despite his over-fondness for the bottle, is still a physician at heart, with a great store of compassion and gentleness and a sense of humor besides, and the whole byplay between him and Buttons, as Doc takes on the responsibility of Peacock's ""condition"" while filching liquor samples out of his valise, adds a much-needed touch of fun.  As for Cord--of whom it was hoped that the Ringo role would be his breakthrough, as it had been John Wayne's--he may not be Wayne, but at about the same age (33 to the Duke's 32) he seems more believable in the part, perhaps because he doesn't claim to have been only ""going on 17"" when he was falsely imprisoned for shooting a man in the back--a crime for which he blames Plummer, who testified against him and ""ended up with [his] family's land and cattle.""  (In the '39 version the dead man was the Plummers' foreman, and there's a strong implication that the family put him out of the way themselves, having first lured the Kid into the area so they could frame him for the murder.)  Pickens's Buck is possibly one of the best roles he ever had, Cummings's' Gatewood is quietly slimy, and Heflin's Curly is clearly an experienced veteran who wants to help Ringo but values the law too much to do so in any direct way.  The only real improbability comes at the end, when Ringo and Dallas take off into the night without so much as a gun, a penny, or even Dallas's trunk--in Wayne's version his Ringo had a ranch ""over the border"" to which he proposed to send the girl until he could join her, and for which, after the Plummers were out of the way, they set out.  The novelization&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stagecoach/dp/B000MOSBL4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stagecoach</a>&nbsp;amplifies many of the scenes and adds some background, especially regarding Peacock, Lucy, and Hatfield.",1457395200,,5636,4.834890965732087

I was in Colorado where it was filmed. The copy looks beautiful. Wish I had a bigger screen. I recently bought a newer copy of John Ford's 'Stagecoach' with John Wayne.

I think it has been underrated by Maltin and others. I, too, greatly admire the 1939 version with John Wayne, but I think, overall, this version of Stagecoach is every bit as good as the earlier one -  and no, it is not too long.
It is also wonderful to see so many great stars from 1966, most of whom are no longer with us.

4894449,5,B005UO1CLM,Loved this movie as a kid growing up in the 60s. I'm not sure why people get hung up comparing this to the original Stagecoach from 1939. This movie to me stands on it's own. I fell in love with Ann Margaret as a kid watching this movie. Alex Cord does a great job and there's a super supporting cast. What took so long in getting this out on DVD I have no idea. There are many hidden gems that for whatever reason take forever to make it to DVD.,1362614400,,446,3.966666666666667

4894451,4,B005UO1CLM,"I have to admit I had reservations about a remake of the John Wayne version, but I did enjoy it. The all star cast is great and they stayed with the original storyline. I just love Ann-Margret in westerns. The indian fight was a rip-roaring shoot-em up event. The scenery was great. All star acting from some great actors of the western era......support your favorite artists.",1360195200,,376,4.712121212121212
4894452,5,B005UO1CLM,"I ordered the 1966 production of Stagecoach from Amazon.  Few people realize that this movie has been very hard to get, at best on VHS tape.  Now it is on DVD.  The cast is superb, the music is outstanding, and the art production for the movie was done by Norman Rockwell.  Folks don't generally know that Winchester produced the 1866-1966 commemorative rifle and carbine and used the Stagecoach artwork to help market the firearms.  Both the rifle and carbine are very hard to get now.  The movie itself was shot on location near Nederland, Colorado along the front range of the Rocky Mountains.  The scenery is gorgeous.  I highly recommend both the movie and Amazon.",1359331200,2,669,4.756521739130434

4894458,3,B005UO1CLM,"1966's ""Stagecoach"" was a bit of a dud getting terrible reviews but now getting royal treatment from Twilight Time in a limited edition on DVD.  Jammed packed with lesser stars but top billed by Bing Crosby and Ann-Margret and with Stephanie Powers, Slim Pickens, Bob Cummings, Red Buttons, Mike Connors, Keenan Wynn and Van Heflin  (Heflin worked opposite A-M the year before it in the exceptional ""Once a Thief"" directed by Ralph Nelson), but the real strength comes from Alex Cord (""Synanon"") in the anti-hero John Wayne role, ""The Ringo Kid.""  I admit his scenes with Ann-Margret have dramatic impact probably more to great acting in love scenes by Ann-Margret, but even there he brings a sense of naivete and innocence to his tough ex-con status as a loser opposite her loser character saloon girl.  I like Ann-Margret better in as ""Melba"" in ""The Cincinnati Kid"" directed by Norman Jewison that same year, and I think that later A-M would have chewed up the scenery to give her ""Dallas"" character here more life.  ""Stagecoach"" was well directed by Gordon Douglas (""Rio Conchos"") but a lot looks like it was filmed on a set and the actors look like they just stepped out of hairdressing and make-up most of the time even white battling Indians.  There are Norman Rockwell renderings of each character at the end accompanied by a song ""Stagecoach to Cheyenne"" which is sung by Wayne Newton.  You can see the Hollywood star power at work here as Newton clearly has no more connections to headline a major movie song today.  The DVD has an isolated track of the score by Jerry Goldsmith as a bonus feature.  And perhaps its greatest achievement is that it shows that it was one Hollywood vehicle that definitely made good cause for a re-make, but alas, as we know today, they could never make them better than the original.

But I remember seeing the movie poster for it and it just looked exciting.  Maybe because of my age.  I like it better then the original.  Although nobody can do John Wayne.  Alec Cord and Ann Margret are really good together.  And She comes off as being the star of the movie.  It to me is an exciting movie.

8487003,4,B005UO1CLM,"I saw this as a teen when it was released in theaters.  I probably had never seen the John Ford version, and I thought this was pretty good.  (Alex Cord performed his own stunt, jumping onto the stagecoach horses.  Yakima Canutt doubled for John Wayne, and was the Indian who fell under the coach.  Canut supervised the chariot race in the Heston 'Ben-Hur', and Canutt's son was the driver of the chariot that smashed into the stopped chariot.  Yakima was the Union soldier shot on the staircase of Tara in 'Gone with the wind'.  But I digress.)  The 1966 version is better than the Johnny Cash remake.",1510444800,,602,4.570093457943925
8487004,3,B005UO1CLM,Well I have to say this was half as good as the original. Liked Bing and really liked Ann Margret but not enough to think it was better or as good as the first one. The guy who said John Ford and John Wayne ruled is correct. Why it took so long for Mr Wayne to get an Oscar shows how stupid the award is. This one is OK though and I could watch it again. But not for a long while.,1508803200,,380,3.6463414634146343

The film is filled with well-known actors, including Bing Crosby, Red Buttons, Michael Connors, Alex Cord, Keenan Wynn, Bob Cummings, Van Heflin, Slim Pickens, Stefanie Powers, Ann Margret, and Wayne Newton sings one song. Additionally, the famed Norman Rockwell's paintings of the main actors appears at the end.

The film has everything that is in other westerns, or most everything:
Indian attacks
Massacres
Gambling
Dance girls
Prostitutes
Stabbings
Shootings
A drunk doctor
An outlaw breaking out of jail
Mistreatment in jail
A thieving banker
A prim-virgin-like pregnant female rushing to meet her husband
Ridding in Indian land
An innocent man found guilty
A love interest
A gun fight: three bad men against one good man
and About fifty Indians chasing a stagecoach

It was a total waste of time!",1488499200,,302,4.084745762711864
