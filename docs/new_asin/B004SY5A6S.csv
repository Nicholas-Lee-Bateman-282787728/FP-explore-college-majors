8440297,5,B004SY5A6S,"I had been Pole dancing for about a year when I realized I needed to spend more time improving my splits, back flexability and really all over flexability to advance my practice!  I seached around for a good DVD because my Pole studio did NOT offer stretching classes! I stummbled across Amy's DVD and bought it along with the foam roller DVD and I have been an avid user!

What I like-The DVD breaks down all the moves and tells you what you are stretching out...I now have it all memorized and can just do the video while listening to my music-it has a nice flow to it!

What I did not like-I don't like that in the 'timed' section, or section 2 they go over how to do the move again-although it's explained in section 1...for those of us who use the video 3x+ a week this gets a little old but I just held the stretch through the explaining part and got a longer stretch so not that big of a deal!

The Foam roller vid is great...I love it and foam rolling helps to loosen you up and releave sore muscles I try and do it 2x a week...it's amazing!

I have gone from 8"" away to 1/2"" away in my splits in 5months! My back is a lot more Flexable....and I am so glad this DVD exisits or I wouldn't have known where to start!",1355097600,2,1222,4.096234309623431
8440298,2,B004SY5A6S,I just got this today.  First off the videos just count down for the exercises....BOOOOO.  You get a small tutorial of how to do the exercise then you get a screen indicating do 10 reps and a count down screen and you are expected to remember the proper form during this count down screen.  Why would they do this.  This doesnt make sense.  Especially because in exercising form is important and while you are doing the exercise you are also studying the trainers form.  You do not get to do this with these videos.  I am really disappointed.  They need to redo this and have the person exercise with you and eliminate the worthless countdown screen.,1307059200,3,650,4.543103448275862
