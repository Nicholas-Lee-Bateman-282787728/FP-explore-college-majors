5801384,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"All too often a movie turns out to be less than what the trailers lead you to expect, but every now and then there's a movie that surprises you by being more.  The Book Thief is one of those movies.  Directed by Brian Percival (Downton Abbey, North & South) from a screenplay by Michael Petroni (The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys) adapted from the novel of the same name by Marcus Zusak, The Book Thief does not lend itself to easy categorization.  On the surface, you'd think from the trailers that it's an Anne Frank sort of film, a young girl's POV about life under the Nazis and about a family hiding a young Jewish man in their house.  But it's more than that, a lot more.

You know you're in for something different when the film begins with the narrated line ""Here's a small fact:  you're going to die.""  You know you're in for something really different when you realize that the narrator is Death.  And it is Death who introduces us to Liesel (marvelously played by Sophie N&eacute;lisse) a young German girl riding on a train with her very ill younger brother, being taken to a place she does not know to live with people she's never met.  Her brother does not make it, dying before they reach their destination, resulting in the train stopping for an impromptu burial service. As they are departing the grave, Sophie notices a book that fell out of the makeshift shroud her brother had been buried in and on an impulse she steals it, wanting to have something to remember him by.  Her first stolen book, but as it turns out, far from her last.

When Liesel reaches her destination, she is taken to meet the couple who are to become her foster parents, Hans (Geoffrey Rush) and Rosa (Emily Watson) Hubermann. Hans, who makes his living as a house painter and sometime accordionist, is genial and welcoming. Rosa, who takes in laundry for some of the town's more prosperous citizens, is stern and no nonsense. Witnessing Liesel's arrival is a neighbor boy, Rudy Steiner (Nico Liersch) whose curiosity about her quickly evolves into a hopelessly sweet crush, prompting him to ask to walk her to school on her first day. Things however get off to a rocky start when the teacher directs Liesel to write her name on the blackboard and, after awkward hesitation, she can only write a couple of X's, revealing that she can neither read nor write. The other children taunt her, particularly one boy, a bully named Franz (Levin Liam) who follows her into the schoolyard, daring her to read a single word. Liesel finally retaliates by attacking Franz and beating him up in front of the other kids, which earns her definite points in Rudy's estimation.

When he hears of the incident, Hans gently sits down with Liesel and informs her that he's not such a good reader himself and suggests that perhaps they can learn to read together, which prompts Liesel to bring out the book she took from her brother's grave, saying this is what she wants to learn to read, and so the book thief learns to read from the first book she stole. To help her, Hans turns the basement into a kind of makeshift schoolroom, painting the letters of the alphabet on various walls and columns and giving Liesel chalk to write each new word she learns under the letter it starts with.

The cast are excellent, particularly Sophie N&eacute;lisse (Monsieur Lazhar) as Liesel, a young girl coming of age under circumstances few children should ever have to experience but all too many did.  Veteran actor Geoffrey Rush (The King's Speech, Shakespeare in Love) is perfect as Hans Hubermann, the amiably gentle man who becomes Liesel's adoptive father, as is Emily Watson (Anna Karenina, Angela's Ashes) as Rosa, Hans' brusque, hard-nosed wife who becomes Liesel's adoptive mother and who later surprises Liesel by showing that you truly cannot judge a book by its cover.  Nico Liersch does an excellent job as Rudy, the boy who becomes Liesel's best friend and who has a sweet but seemingly hopeless crush on her, forever begging her for a kiss.  Ben Schnetzer (Happy Town) is quietly effective as Max, the young Jewish man who prompts Liesel's initial forays into story-telling by having her describe to him what goes on in the world outside the Hubermann basement, the world where he does not dare venture. And Roger Allam (V for Vendetta, Inkheart) is outstanding as the unseen but ever felt narrating Death, adding a subtle dimension to events as viewed from his unique perspective.

I have not read the book, but from what I gather the film had to reduce the number of characters somewhat in order to give more focus to the main characters in the more limited amount of time available to a film version. But from what other reviewers who have read the book have said, this does not seem to get in the way in their enjoyment of the film.

In addition to all of the things that make The Book Thief work is John Williams' sweetly haunting score that enhances the lyrical quality of the film, giving it the feel of almost being a fairy tale in spite of the stressful time and circumstances, which is in a way fitting when you think about the nature of many fairy tales that deal with the darker elements of childhood.  I personally think this score is the best work Williams has done in years and may end up getting a nod at Oscar time.

Highly recommended.",1386979200,324,5360,4.628029504741834
5801385,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"I agree with reviewers who consider this film one of the best film they ever saw. The acting is excellent; in fact, I think Geoffrey Rush should win an academy award. People who do not like to see the horrors of the holocaust can still view this film. It does not depict what occurred in the concentration camps but what happened to a single family and the families around them. Its message is love; humans need to care for one another, save them if at all possible, as is done several times in this film.",1386806400,18,505,4.326315789473684
5801386,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"No need to describe the movie as others have already done that thoroughly. However, I do want to give this film the five stars it deserves. It is so rare to find a well made movie that is clean and yet has some substance to it. Nowadays if you want a clean movie all you got is Disney, but their movies simply repeat the same silly formulas. The Book Thief is clean, but has a point to it. I wish they made more movies like this! I haven't read the book, but this is one of the best movies I've seen so maybe I should go ahead and read the book too.",1386460800,34,549,3.9107142857142856
5801387,4,B00DHJT5Q6,"I am unfamiliar with the book, so this review will take the movie on its own terms.  The narrative structure begins rather surprisingly, with Death as the deep-voiced, but mellow, narrator.  In 1938 in Nazi Germany, an orphan named Liesel is adopted by a bristly new mother and much gentler new father.  Emily Watson plays the mother and Geoffrey Rush the father.  Liesel gets to know a blonde-haired, pleasant, free-spirited boy in the town, Rudy, and also must face the daily struggle of hiding a Jewish refugee named Max for over 2 years, after Kristallnacht.  She also secretly raids the Burgermeister's personal library because she wants to read, which becomes another major subplot.

The story is original and has some moments of deep suspense, but since it strives for realism, also has tragedy; that's the way life goes in war.  (My own personal reaction to its theme about the fragility of life:  Stories like this are strong reminders to me of how unbearable life can be when you don't have a basis for confidence about life after death.  Too bad that in her love of literature, the character Liesel didn't discover the Bible and the hope it offers of that!)

I found it worth seeing, though it is deeply sad in ways.  There are enjoyable sentimental and suspenseful moments in it, though. The actors all do very well, including the Liesel actress, Sophie Nlisse, and Nico Liersch, who plays her boyfriend Rudy.  The quality acting helps the movie feel like an authentic rendition of life under the Nazi regime.  I most of all like Geoffrey Rush's characterization of the adopted father, Hans Hubermann.  He ought to get an Academy Award for his great performance.  Additionally, John Williams wrote the music to this, his first non-Spielberg collaboration in a long while.",1386288000,6,1783,4.8966666666666665
5801388,4,B00DHJT5Q6,"It has been a busy 2013 for novel-to-film adaptations. Clearly, the biggest and most outstanding film in that club has been The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, with The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug and World War Z also being noteworthy examples of prosperous films. But, one of the more underrated adaptions, taking place in the unimaginable setting of Nazi Germany, is Australian author Markus Zusak's story, The Book Thief.

British director Brian Percival takes on Michael Petroni's screenplay in the film imagining of The Book Thief, a story taking place during World War II  a time that was full of discrimination, war, and the major purge of society. The main character is Liesel Meminger (Sophie Nlisse), a young girl that is adopted by two loving German's, Hans Hubermann (Geoffrey Rush) and his wife, Rosa (Emily Watson). For sure, Liesel finds the transition period to be rough with getting to know her new parents, dealing with bullies at school, and attempting to find her place in a fascist nation. Fortunately, a young boy and also her next door neighbor, Rudy Steiner (Nico Liersch), quickly befriends her. After a short amount of time, the two are basically inseparable  but, a secret stands between them.

One day, a young man knocks on the front door of the Hubermann household. His name is Max (Ben Schnetzer) and he is the son of a man that saved Hans' life during World War I. Hans vowed that if there was anything he or his family could do to repay the sacrifice, he would not hesitate. Unfortunately, Max is a Jewish man living in a country where he's surrounded by hatred and a government that is maliciously unrelenting towards the individuals of his ethnicity. With nowhere else to go, Max asks for a place to hide  thus putting the family in a difficult position, but a position they will not ignore.

At the same time, Liesel has grown fond of learning to read, which her new adoptive father was more than happy to teach her. Even since she finished her first book, she has been willing to read anything and everything. One day, she takes a basket of laundry to the house of Ilsa Hermann, the wife of a well-off German official (Liesel's adoptive mother has been doing Ilsa's husband's laundry for years). The Hermann estate happens to house a vast library of which Liesel is instantly infatuated with and is allowed to visit often to read. Eventually, the business relationship comes to an end, which prompts Liesel to begin sneaking into the Hermann's house to borrow books to read (that she does return when she's finished).

As you might expect, the complications arise from Max living in the household, along with the growing unrest from the events of World War II. Random bombings become a regular occurrence, throwing the entire area into panic and disarray. To make matters worse, basically any able-bodied male is called to defend their country, including those closest to Liesel. Emotions run high as she is forced to contend with more emotion in a short amount of time than most people experience in a lifetime.

If you've read the novel prior to seeing the film, you'll obviously notice several different nuances  but nothing that's detrimental to the original plot. For the most part, the sentiment of this story is in the right spot, yet one of the factors that should have played a heavier role in the film is the impact Nazi Germany had on society. This was a place in time where the smallest indiscretion could easily lead to being shot in the street or put on a train to an interment camp. Still, the Nazi's are not depicted in the fearful manner that they could have been. However, keep in mind The Book Thief is a story written for young adults and with that in mind, this story may be a bit overwhelming for the same target audience in which the book was originally written. For someone who's unfamiliar with the novel, it might be hard to interpret the message of this story: a message that shows the importance of family, generosity, and survival.

For me (someone that absolutely loves history), this film was everything I could have imagined and more. The story is certainly unique, but it's the cast that does a tremendous job of bringing these characters from the page to the screen. Sophie Nlisse is quite impressive in the lead as Liesel. It's a rarity for someone so young to provide such mastery in a role that has layers upon layers of depth. For such a young girl, her journey throughout this small German community is quite extraordinary. Initially, she's just a curious, vulnerable girl  but one act of bravery (or stupidity if she would have been caught) defines who she is: a thief. In fact, she might be the most honorable, noble thief in the history of storytelling.

The supporting cast surrounding Nlisse couldn't have been any better, and that includes the performance given by her onscreen neighbor and cohort, portrayed by young Nico Liersch. He just seems to mesh with Nlisse perfectly, as he humorously courts her and values their friendship from the very beginning. Just as important as Liersch's performance is that of the Liesel's adoptive parents, portrayed flawlessly by both Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson. Although Watson stands out a bit more (because of her strict nature) than Rush, they both prove to be the most loving parents a seemingly lost girl could ask for  and are absolutely vital to the development of Liesel into young womanhood.

Surprisingly (especially for the non-readers), the revelation of the mysterious voice that narrates various portions of the film will have more of an impact than you'd expect. He pops in from time to time, but viewers would normally be safe to assume that it's someone that Liesel or perhaps the family will encounter somewhere along the line in the future. That statement couldn't be any further from the truth. Still, this unforgiving narrator leaves his mark in the final moments  which progress rather quickly after a lengthy war that's hardly described in much detail. To be honest, unless you're loosely familiar with certain dates or events in German history, a few events in this film will be lost on you (such as the reason the Nazi regime burns books in the first place or the seemingly random emphasis on the 1936 Olympic games). Have no fear, this small inconvenience doesn't weigh the film down in any manner.

Overall, The Book Thief adaptation to film is an adequate rendition of Markus Zusak's young adult novel. It might not be everything you'd hope and dream of as a history buff, but the sentiment is there and it tells a moving story  not to mention John Williams composing (Star Wars, Jurassic Park). The ending turns out to be quite the handful and sadly, it won't send you home with a resounding smile on your face. On the other hand, the significant elements, like the cinematography, costuming, and poverty stricken settings all sell this as a film straight out of the early 1940s in Nazi occupied Germany. Even to this day, it's hard to believe how such a period in human history could even take place, and this movie serves as a brief, demoralizing glimmer of what innocent people were forced to endure. At the end of the day, all are encouraged to give this film a chance even though most will find the historical backdrop to be a bit of a bore.

5801389,4,B00DHJT5Q6,"""The Book Thief"" (2013 release; 132 min.) is the film adaptation of the beloved novel by Markus Zusak. As the movie opens, Death (in a voice over) cautions the audience ""one small fact: you are going to die"", and with that we are filled with a pending doom and gloom about what is to happen. The stage is Nazi-Germany, February 1938, and we are introduced to Liesel, a young girl (9 or 10 yrs. old) who has just lost her younger brother to (unspecified) sickness as they are being transported to their new foster family. Liesel's foster mom Rosa is as tough a cookie as her foster dad Hans is as sweet a man you'll ever meet (he calls Liesel ""your majesty"" to make her feel welcome). Liesel befriends Rudi, a boy on her street, and soon they become best friends. Foster dad Hans teaches Liesel to read, which opens a new world for Liesel and she eagerly snaps up the opportunity to explore new books. Then Kristallnacht (""night of the broker glass"") takes place and Max, a Jewish young man whose dad once saved Hans' life, takes refuge in the home of Hans, Rosa and Liesel. At this point we are about 40 min. into the movie. Will Liesel ever see her real mom again? Will Max survive the years of hiding? What becomes of Liesel and Rudi? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is a very careful/faithful adaptation of the novel, as directed by pretty much unknown UK director Brian Percival. If there is one complaint that I may have about the movie, it is that pretty much every scene feels very much staged (which of course they are), almost like we're watching a theatre production and not a movie. Second, the acting performances are top-notch, with Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson as the loving foster parents, but the real revelation is the young Canadian actress Sophie N&eacute;lisse, in the role of Liesel. N&eacute;lisse had previously appeared in last year's excellent (and Oscar-nominated) Canadian film ""Monsieur Lazhar"". In this movie she radiates such presence on the big screen that she almost blows everyone else away. Third, the movie features an excellent soundtrack, by none other than the legendary John Williams, in one of his rare non-Steven Spielberg movie efforts (I couldn't help but think that in fact ""The Book Thief"" feels like it could've been made by Spielberg). Last, be sure to bring a Kleenex tissue with you, as chances are that you will need it.

I had seen the trailer of this a few times in recent weeks and was looking forward to seeing this. The movie opened this weekend at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati. When I went to see it last night (a weekday night), I was pleasantly surprised how well attended it was. If you loved the novel, you will certainly love this movie adaptation. Even if you didn't read the novel, and are in the mood for something that is not quite your standard Hollywood fare, I suggest you seek out ""The Book Thief"", be it in the theatre or on DVD/Bly-ray. You won't be disappointed.",1386115200,20,3066,4.623853211009174
5801390,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"Those who love Markus Zusak's The Book Thief as I do will know that it is an incredibly complex novel - the way the main characters intersect each other's lives and the themes that are developed throughout the novel are deep and layered and would make for a daunting on-screen translation. Yet director Brian Percival manages to make the movie accessible to viewers whilst staying true to the source material. This may not be a blow-by-blow, faithful to each and every word adaptation, but to me at least, it is a true adaptation in portraying the essence of the story. I love the book but I also loved the movie, for similar and different reasons.

The story of The Book Thief begins with the narrator, Death (Roger Allam), providing a sort of overview/introduction. Fortunately, the narrator's voice is not dominant throughout the story as it would (to me) have been a rather distracting voice, but the narrator's presence is felt nevertheless. The protagonist in this film is Liesel (Sophie Nelisse in a ground-breaking performance), a young teenager who comes to live with her foster parents, Hans Hubermann (Geoffrey Rush) and his wife, the acid- tongued Rosa (Emily Watson). The setting at the beginning of the story is Germany in 1938 and the story goes on till the end of WW II. Liesel's mother is a Communist and has been packed off somewhere, presumably a camp, for this is after all Nazi Germany.

The story focuses on Liesel's relationship with her foster parents, her best friend, Rudy (Nico Liersch), and her life-defining friendship with Max (Ben Schnetzer), the young Jewish man hiding in her parents' basement. At the beginning of the story Liesl is unable to read but this slowly changes as first her foster father Hans and later Max help her see beyond the words to the very notions underlying those words. Soon Liesel is reading voraciously and also developing a keen sense of what it means to live in such troubled times, and who by the end of the story, has come to truly understand the power of words and what defines moral courage.

The themes in the book are manifold and I felt these themes were beautifully portrayed in the film. The ideas of friendship, paternal and maternal love, loyalty, and courage, not to mention of course, Death, are credibly-woven together in such a way that these themes flow throughout the film as a whole instead of distinct parts. The cast, especially Nelisse as Liesel, delivers a finely-nuanced performance, every emotion captured by those beautiful, wide, expressive eyes, and Rush as her foster father Hans portrays the very symbol of paternal love and moral courage (especially in the scene where he stands up to a Gestapo officer in defense of a friend).

The film is rated PG-13, but I watched this with my husband and 9-year-old (who has read The Diary of Anne Frank and is somewhat familiar with the history of the Holocaust), and she was absolutely captivated by this film. There are no scenes of extreme or prolonged violence - some scenes of kids fighting, Nazis dragging people off, Nazis burning books, children chanting pro-Nazi slogans (which is disturbing to me but of course given the context of the film, it cannot be helped), Nazis and collaborators destroying Jewish property during Kristallnacht, but nothing like the scenes one sees in movies like Schindler's List. It made for an interesting family discussion after we finished viewing it.

The film's ultimate message is positive and there are certainly many interesting issues that come up for discussion - moral courage being one that I felt was significant. Do we stand by and watch atrocities and injustice perpetrated without voicing against it, and if we do, are we prepared for the repercussions? These and more are satisfactorily addressed in this film, and I count this as one of the more memorable films of 2013.",1385596800,208,3854,4.886850152905199
5801391,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"Note: I saw an advanced screening of The Book Thief.

The Book Thief is a book that has stuck with me for so many years, there is just something so powerful and raw about Zusak's novel. The Book Thief has to be one of the trickiest books to adapt because it's far from a simple story. The novel is nearly 600 pages and it's main narrator is Death himself commenting on the events of World War II. How could Brian Percival (Downton Abbey) direct such a movie without doing the novel injustice?

  The Book Thief is true to it's source material, even though it doesn't maintain all of the major plot events in the novel. The filmmakers rarely utilized Death's narration, so the few times they did use it, it felt a bit awkward and out of place. I didn't get quite the chills from hearing his narration like I did when I had read the book. Despite the unevenness of the narration, The Book Thief really captures the essence of Liesel's story. All of the characters were truly perfectly cast, the dialogue is well done and the film truly captures all of the emotion from Zusak's novel.

  Sophie Nelisse is essentially a newcomer to Hollywood and this is her first major role in a movie. I really hope Nelisse wins an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance because it's absolutely unbelieveable. Nelisse's performance is absolutely unbelievable and it's clear to me that Nelisse is an extremely talented actress. Even though Nelisse shares screentime with veterans like Watson and Rush, Nelisse truly steals the show and easily makes viewers fall in love with Liesel.

  Both Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson did wonders in The Book Thief, they truly translated the characters from the book into their performances in a flawless manner. Rush and Watson became Rosa and Hans as if it was natural to them, like these parts were made for them.

  Rush and Nelisse are a duo that demands the viewers' attention and they truly make this a poignant movie. Their performances carry the film and bring The Book Thief to the next level. If neither Rush nor Nelisse receive Academy Award nominations for their performances, I'll truly be disappointed because their performances are something brilliant. I don't want to discredit Nico Liersch (Rudy) and Ben Schnetzer (Max) because their performances were also unbelieveable. I was just completely caught off guard by Rush, Nelisse, and Watson's extremely memorable acting.

  I'm not an extremely emotional movie viewer by any standard, I rarely am moved by movies. The Book Thief really captured me emotionally despite the fact that I knew what would happen next because I had read the book. Despite my knowledge of the plot, the actors fooled me into thinking that maybe it would end differently, maybe my heart wouldn't be stomped on. I was wrong, by the end of The Book Thief I was driven to tears by the movie's incredibly heartbreaking conclusion. I can't remember the last time I had cried this much during a movie, my head ached from crying so much over Zusak's characters.

  The Book Thief may not live up to Zusak's novel, but it is one of the best movies I have seen in years. The Book Thief provides an incredible, unique perspective of World War II from a whole new angle. This is the type of movie that will truly stay with viewers long after the credits roll, absolutely unforgettable. I truly hope that The Book Thief will find an audience because it's an extremely well-done film that deserves widespread acclaim. The Book Thief is an absolute must-see and I hope it will continue to strike a chord with audiences everywhere.",1384560000,221,3589,4.750402576489533

The role of Death is a great twist and his dialog is intriguing.  There was no need to show the dead near the end--it was not gratuitous or anything (far from it as it seemed fake), it just took away from the powerful dialog Death had.  It was almost like the producer didn't think the audience would understand what happened unless he showed some bodies.  There were so many good scenes though!

LOL (Death is the person telling the story). He starts right out telling you what ""happens"" (you know who dies etc ....) right from the start so you can forget about worrying over what will happen to the people you end up falling in love with.

5801524,4,B00DHJT5Q6,"This 2013 film was based on the 2005 novel of the same name by Markus Zusak.  Liesel is a young girl who is taken in by a foster family in Germany.  Her adoptive father teaches her to read, and when the family hides a fleeing Jew named Max, Liesel takes to borrowing/stealing books that she reads to help keep his hopes and spirit alive.

There are some particularly fine performances from the actors who play Liesel (Sophie Nelisse) and her adoptive father (Geoffrey Rush), and their characterization is very good.  I also appreciated how the film shows the effect of the war on ordinary German civilians, some of whom were caught up in the patriotism, but others who selflessly worked against the regime to protect life.  This offers a fresh perspective on a subject (World War 2) which often sees the same ground covered in films, but fortunately that is not the case here.  The film is rated PG-13, but mostly due to the violence that forms the background to the story and is more implied than shown; there's no real blood or gore.  Without needing to resorting to graphic violence, the film shows the very real effect of war on lives like Liesel's.  It also has a very positive message about self-sacrifice and love for the neighbour.

While there are many good aspects to the film, it still felt mediocre and disappointing.  The personification of Death as narrator was jarring and confusing, and his message about the perplexity of human life was unclear; it's an empty message that offers no real hope, despite attempting to tug at heart-strings.  Also unclear was the concept of how words have the power of life, and the title ""Book Thief"" only played a minor role in the film.  From what I have learned subsequently, the book that the plot is based on emphasizes this much more strongly, and many people who have come from the book and watched the film found it a very unsatisfying adaptation.  There's also several instances of blasphemy that are more typical of a modern audience rather than pre-war Germany.

Overall, perhaps this is a case of: Read the book, don't watch the movie. - GODLY GADFLY (April 2017)",1492819200,7,2123,4.702702702702703

But I think Ben Schentzer is a fabulous actor and he is in so few movies, I figured I would give it a shot.

This movie was a knockout - and I hope the young girl won an award because she just nailed her role.

It COULD be classified as slow moving to those who do not like movies that speak to them; this movie was deep and emotional. It is one of the few I have seen recently that makes you think and feel. and so much of that is due to the superb casting and phenomenal acting.",1488585600,,637,3.9609375

Meanwhile whilst reading books to this girl, the family hides a jew and soon after this the Americans air raid germany and everyone around this girl dies, except the Jew and eventually he too dies along with the girl.

Meanwhile the story portrayed the time period almost perfectly, they just needed more soldiers roaming the streets and it lacked major military influence such as it was in that time. The movie also showed barely any of the war front.

The narrator foreshadows that everyone is gonna die at the end because he says death comes to everyone, but Liesel is special . This quote also foreshadows that Liesel will live the longest as well. I believe that this brings an interesting twist to the story using death as the main character and all.

The explosions were basic but they worked just as well as the angles they use to shoot the camera shots. They used minimal stunts but they worked out to be quite smooth. The lighting set a similar mood to a war but not too on point with the mood.

The only details that this movie needed was closure on the character that is the bully to Liesel; this would have made a great side message. The birth mother was also never mentioned at the end as well as her birth father never being mentioned.",1487808000,,1513,4.431654676258993

I would have stopped watching after 20 minutes had not it been part of a school assignment.  This was very disappointing and I love Downton Abby (same director).  Rather than a movie, this should have been a miniseries. Don't waste your time, this does not capture the essence of the book. The book develops  Death, the narrator, as an essential character of the story, in the film he is an afterthought. Oh... spoiler alert.. apparently according to the movie, the Book Thief is a Book Borrower.  Really, the movie can't even stand on its own, you have to have read the book to even understand what is going on in the movie

Don't watch this if you like the book, Don't watch this because you don't want to read the book, just read the cliff notes, you won't understand what is going on and essential themes are missing from from the movie and characters and timelines are blended .

5801617,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"I see their ugliness and their beauty and wonder how the same thing can be both? - Narrator / Death (Roger Allam)

The story takes place in the time surrounding the Second World War. Young Liesel (Sophie N&eacute;lisse) is removed from her commie mother and placed in a foster home. Her new foster mother appears to be cold and ruthless. Liesel must grow up and adapt to the changing social atmosphere. During this time she acquires the nasty habit of reading. However reading a secondary to what social skills she will learn, that is if she survives the war; these skills will carry her for the rest of her life.

If you are looking for something unique you will be disappointed. However for those who like challenging Junge/ M&auml;dchen facing trials and tribulations during times of adversity than this movie is for you. The story is not unique with the exception of the subplot where it gets its title. What really makes the movie are the acting, the scenery, and even the background music, by John Williams, which acts as a character itself.

I have to admit that I have not read the book yet; therefore I can tell you whether the book by Marcus Zusak is better or not, that this movie holds its own independently.

For me the book burning scene made me feel a tad like films where they kick the family dog. It is well worth the time to view.

I listened to the audio book, and my daughter (at ages 10-13) read the digital copy many times (she is a deep child, not disturbed by this type of novel, not appropriate for all kids - I would label it a 13+ selection).n  I LOVED the narration of the audio book - they did an awesome job with it!  The book is VERY LONG, though - so when doing audio, perhaps speed up the play back a little bit. :-)

Together with Hans' wife Rosa (Emily Watson), the three struggle to survive the bleak days as the war escalates around them.
The acting, particularly Rush, is mesmerizing. While the original novel was written for young adults, the movie has turned this into a story with universal appeal.

5801932,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"The Book Thief is told from the perspective of death, and the movie does a nice job of weaving this into the story through the voice of a narrator. These inserted messages aer not constant, rather they are sprinkled in sparingly yet strategically. This story does a nice job of painting the picture of fear & trepidation that lived in the souls of Germans during WWII. Often, we read/view stories of that time-frame focusing on the horrors inflicted on the Jews, which is incredibly important, but I think it can be easy to overlook the difficulty of being just a regular German citizen during that time period. The oppressive existence is poignantly portrayed in this movie.",1466899200,,675,4.827586206896552

Liesel's mother can no longer care for her and her brother. World War II is going on, and it is Germany. As Liesel and her mother and her brother take a train to their new foster parent's home, Liesel's brother dies. They must stop along the tracks to bury him. As the gravedigger walks away, he drops his gravedigger's manual. Liesel picks it up and claims it as her own. She cannot read, but she treasures the book. Her new father teaches her to read, and she practices all the time, becoming a ravenous reader. As she learns to read, she changes the lives of the people around her.

 This is the one case in which I felt that the movie was better than the book. To me, the book felt very childish. I know it was originally written for the young adult audience. The movie, however was very beautifully photographed. The actors, including Geoffrey Rush as Liesel's foster father, were amazing, and the impact of the storyline really came across. As a movie, this is a truly amazing and unforgettable one!",1466467200,2,1037,4.50531914893617

5802006,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"I loved this movie.  I really, really loved the book.  The language in the book gave me the chills, in a good way.  Can't do too much of that in the movie, but it is very well done.  When I really love a book, I lots of times can't stand the film adaption because I want the book essentially rendered to the screen, which doesn't always work out so well.  But I do love this movie.  I loved Emily Watson, who played the gruff Rosa; she does a great job.  I think all the actors were good; she just tickled me most.  Just perfect.  This is a WW II film, so you know, not all is flowers and sunshine.  But it is worthwhile.",1463788800,2,621,3.975609756097561

The principle actors were well cast and could have easily handled a more challenging script, while the extras seemed to be waiting for someone to tell them what to do.  The many street scenes looked like they were filmed on back-lot sets.  The inconsistent peppering of the dialogue with smatterings of German awkwardly spoken by non-German actors was jarring and actually detracted from the authenticity.  Perhaps worst of all, the film opens with the worst narration I have ever encountered.  Yes, there were some poignant moments; but I never felt drawn in.",1457308800,,611,5.1938775510204085

5802168,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"Have to admit that I wasn't impressed with the movie as it began, but as the plot developed, I realized the immensity of riches below the surface!  Our family has watched it numerous times the past two weeks & every time, learned a new lesson.  The primary one I'm carrying with me is what Liesel said to Hans shortly before the climax of the movie.  Hans tells her that her mother told him what she'd done & why.  She looks at him & replies simply, ""Because that's what people do.""  Wow!  You'll feel like you got hit with a tank when that lesson hits your heart!  People help those in need, even if helping means endangering their own lives.  This truly IS what normal people with well-formed consciences do!  These days we see the majority of Americans who have no conscience at all--very self-centered individuals who refuse to help anyone in need.  The days of war are approaching rapidly again.

This movie, almost as well as the eponymous book, affords a look at those lives in a small town in Germany.  The performances of Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson as foster parents are absolutely brilliant.  Emily Watson in particular had a very complex character to interpret, and did a great job.

I thought it was a great movie which offer a bit different prespective on WWII. Specifically, what all of us may have wonder over the years: how do an ideology so atrocious been embrached by an entire nation? And here it shows you how the power of intimidation, propaganda, lack of education and culture, fear and starvation can turn even the better people into passive followers for the sake of preservation and lack of other resources. It makes you wonder: what would I have done in those same circumstances? Not from teh comfort of my home today, but during years of cold winters, starvation, conscription, deportation and policing by your own countrymen? It shows you how we all should beware of wild spread over-popular ideaologies, mainstram manipulated infomation and the bullies that promote them. What happened in Germany can happen anywhere and for any reason, when we are least expecting and particularly when we think it can never happen to us. Just because we have been told we are free, does it mean we really are?

5802488,3,B00DHJT5Q6,"Ill start this off by saying I have a love of foreign films and WWII themes (as it was part of my studies). However, my expectations fell short. I think this is an important film for everyone to watch to understand the horrific past so it never reoccurs, but if you have a knowledge of this time in history, I don't think this movie adds much to the perspective. The acting is very good but the plot isn't that strong. It leaves you with a very saddned sense (as it should) and leaves you scratching your head at the end. Overall, this film didn't add really any perspective that I didn't already know and left me crying on the plane.

At other times the author reaches a little too high and does not quite get there: for instance the narrator gets lost in the action and we forget about him, and it feels odd when he shows up again.

5802577,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"""The Book Thief"" is a sensitive portrait of the human heart. Through watching this movie we learn what it feels like to grow up during a war. Liesel has to keep her family's secrets and this turns out to be quite difficult. The movie is a bit of an adventure and at times feels a bit mysterious. I loved the dreamy vision of a train weaving its way through a snowy land. The cozy library where Liesel reads is also beautiful. What you will especially like is all the relationships Liesel has that are meaningful. Max, the man they are hiding becomes sort of like an older brother to her. I can't say I would have ended the story any other way. It was perfect.

Should, during these events you happen to be a child, the depth of those experiences are multiplied a hundred fold.

The movie is wonderful, I just wish there was more Death narration. I highly recommend reading the book to get the full story, which had to be condensed for understandable reasons in the movie, but you'll also be amused by Death's witty commentary.",1439510400,,286,4.836734693877551

The cast was outstanding, the story well done for the big screen.  I highly recommend this movie.  Even my sister loved this movie, and she doesn't like war movies, normally falls asleep.  IMO The Book Thief is on the same scale as Mrs. Miniver as far as one of the few war movies that focuses more on in this case the German people, that were victims of war, versus the usual military cast you normally see in a war movie.  Easily the best German view of the war, since the movie Europa Europa, also an excellent movie.",1439424000,,649,4.235772357723577

5802664,3,B00DHJT5Q6,"The Book Thief
 Young French Canadian actress Sophie Nelisse forces herself to our attention in the title role as an orphaned girl reared by foster parents in World War II Germany.  Nelisse carries off the complicated role with deft aplomb, taking the character from a stunned, nearly mute, terrified child to a too quickly mature survivor in the midst of the worst war in human history.  She has an engaging screen presence.  I hope to see her again and again as she finds other roles to play.
 Very few films have been built around the theme of the civilian German victims of Hitlers mad war.  Perhaps after nearly 70 years the time has come.  We see Germans terrified by their own government, reduced to slow malnutrition by short rations and suffering from the mass night time air raids of the American Air Corps.  I didn't find much in the film to relieve the relentless horror of the young girls situation.
 But Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson as the adoptive parents displayed the kind of stoic courage, and in the case of Rush as Papa, astonishing kindness and touching humanity.  Australian author Markus Zusak won a slew of awards for his novel as well as the gratitude of his many readers.
 Director Brian Percival has this project as his entry into the big world of Hollywood directing.  He has uneven success.  One scene that he did very well showed a Nazi Party staged book burning.  Percival captures the event from the view point of the townsfolk.  The movie viewers are caught up in the emotionalism of the staged event. We can understand how dictators manipulate the citizenry by playing on our hard wired instincts.  I became enlightened, chilled and sickened all at once.  On the other side of the balance, Percival has his young actress react to every turn in the plot by hugging somebody or other, repetitious to banality by the fifth hug.
 Michael Petroni adapted the novel to the big TV.  The movie is rated PG-13 but perhaps because of the theme, wars inescapable horror, it might have been rated a notch higher.  The film runs a lengthily two hours and 11 minutes.  I couldn't discover the films budget but its harvest at the box office is a tiny $8 million.  Do not take popularity or the lack of it as a reflection on the quality of the film.  This dark tragedy deserves its three saw blade rating.  The acting should boost the rating but the weakness in the original text and uneven direction prevent more saw blades.
 Even the score by world class movie composer John Williams could not, for me, relieve the blanket of melancholy in a movie narrated-literally-by the voice of Death.",1437264000,,2611,4.673245614035087

5802667,2,B00DHJT5Q6,"Maybe it's because I watched the movie right after I read the book - but I thought this was a rather poor effort. The book was wonderfully nuanced and beautifully written, while the movie just told a story. A lot of the greatness of the book comes from the power of words (which is also, to a large extent, the whole point of the book). This is sadly missing in the movie, which feels very much like a standard Nazi Germany/Holocaust film - in which genre it doesn't really match up to the best (i.e. Schindler's List).
I understand that filming this particular book would have been a terribly difficult job, and if they had actually pulled it off it would have been one of the best movies of all time. Unfortunately, they didn't.

___Update______
So I thought some more about why I liked the book so much but disliked the movie - even though the story is essentially the same. Here are my thoughts:

- The movie is just too bright. There is almost a feeling that the cast will break out into song at any moment. The dark, depressing nature of the times is just not captured. This is not all that surprising considering they picked one of the directors of Downton Abbey for this movie.
- Related to the point above, the dark cold basement actually has windows in the movie. Totally kills the whole point about how Max couldn't even see the outside world - and the powerful imagery of him seeing the stars after many months. In the movie, he could have just looked out of his basement window.
- The movie fails to bring out the depression-era hunger and desperation. Most adults and kids seem fairly well-fed and happy most of the time.
- The Nazi atrocities on Jews are largely glossed over. You know something bad is probably happening, but never does this movie truly get its hands dirty, so to speak.
- Similarly to above, it takes a very PG approach to death. After the bomb raid at the end, all the bodies look like they have been nicely embalmed at an undertakers, with some sprinkling of ashes thrown in. There is no blood, no broken limbs, nothing. This after an air raid where the whole street is essentially flattened. I am not comfortable with filmmakers de-sensitizing violent death - even for kids. If anything, they should learn how terrible war is.",1436832000,,2263,4.517073170731707
5802668,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"A very warm, sweet and true story which expresses the way of life of those poor German folks who had hated Hitler and his evil ways, but couldn't do anything about it without getting severely punished or killed by Hitler's supporters.  Those poor people had also suffered greatly under Hitler's power and this is actually the first movie that I have seen which is actually about them.  This movie is progressively slow with its plot but if you are patient and watch it closely, you will love it.  I have watched it many times.  The more times I watch it; the more I love it.",1436832000,,574,4.438095238095238

5802746,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"Initially for me, The Book Thief's title was misleading because personally I thought it would be like The Golden Compass but it wasn't it was much more.  The Book Thief displayed for me a lesson on how to look at and enjoy the value of life even with the twists and turns that it offers.  The Book Thief was adapted from the novel written by Markus Zusak of the same title.

It is a story in the backdrop of World War II Germany about the journey of Liesel (beautifully played by Sophie Nelisse) who is a young orphan sent to live in a foster home in Germany with Hans and Rosa Hubermann.  Upon his first time seeing Liesel, Rudy, her next door neighbor began a friendship and falls in love with her.  A turn happens when at first it appears that Liesel's life would be a disaster in her new home but as Hans began to introduce her to books and teach her how to read the world opens up to her.  Then a twist happens when Max comes to the family door and then another whiff of new life is breathed into Liesel.  She begins to steal books from IIsa's home library to keep the essence of her being alive and to escape the backdrop of the Third Reich. Now another shift is that of the narrator (played by Roger Allam) that sets the storyline and cleverly interweaves himself throughout the story; that's all I will tell you about him :-)

I only gave you bits and pieces in hopes that your interest is peaked enough to see The Book Thief for yourself.  I do not want to give EVERYTHING AWAY but I am sure that if you like intriguing stories with a moral essence to it and a little emotional twist then The Book Thief is for you.

A few days after she received it, she called me, raving about the movie.  She said she loved it.  At first she was skeptical because it was in black and white.

In spite of the hardships of the war, they are still kids, going to school, trying to get enough to eat, experiencing the first blossoms of love, and occasionally running to the air raid shelter.  Good adult characters who struggle to retain their decency and humanity while facing the realties of civilian life in wartime.

Four years pass, and the children remain 10 years old, like live action Simpsons characters. The boy who was recruited for the elite Nazi school mysteriously never goes - was it because his growth was permanently stunted? (the book explains what the movie never bothers to!)
Seemingly, in an attempt to not make everyone British like the Striped Pyjamas movie, here everyone talks in outrageous German accents, which slip all the time because the actors aren't German. (the heavy r's and use of German words is inconsistent)
A waste of Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson.",1425340800,3,772,4.946153846153846

5802944,3,B00DHJT5Q6,"As an avid lover of Markus Zusak's incredible book ""The Book Thief,"" I was naturally anxious to see the movie.

I had mixed feelings about it. I will say this, I think the movie was incredibly well cast. All the characters were absolutely believable, and true to their counterparts in the book. I particularly found the actor and actress who portrayed Max and Liesel to be very well suited to their parts. Some of the scenes (particularly the lighter ones, like the snowman in the basement) were handled very well, sweet and funny, without being too sentimental.

All that being said, I was sorely disappointed with many other aspects of the movie. While I felt that the actor who portrayed Max did an excellent job with the material he was given, the character himself was shamefully shorthanded. Where was the backstory about him being a fist fighter? Where were the two beautiful books he wrote for Liesel? Where was his survivor's guilt? And most shameful of all, where was the heart wrenching scene between him and Liesel in the march to Dachau?

 This is the movie's biggest crime: the erasing of the misery. We do not see Liesel's nightmares over her dead brother. We do not see Han's and Rosa's pain over their Nazi son disowning them. We do not see the suicide of the neighbor's son who was wracked with survivors guilt. We do not see the long line of concentration camp survivors being forced through Molching. We do not see Max in their midst, nor Liesel's anguish over spying him there. We do not see her being whipped because she refuses to leave his side. In short, we are robbed of the (arguably) single most powerful scene in the whole book. The death scenes are tamed down considerably as well, especially Liesel's farewell to Rudy (I wish they had aged him and Liesel at least a little. They were both sixteen when he died, no longer children).

I could go on and on about which beloved scenes did not ultimately make the cut, and yes, yes, yes, I know much of it was done for time, much of it would be considered ""unfilmable,"" but I came away with the feeling that this COULD have been a great film, had the director been willing to drag it through more of the grit and pain the original story explores. For some reason, he chose to sugar coat it, and robbed audiences of a potentially powerful experience.

I'm not going to say that I hated it. I didn't. But I was vastly disappointed.",1424822400,,2405,4.555555555555555

It has prompted several family discussions regarding WWII, and I'm glad it has. I love talking about history (tho I'm not really smart re history) and I love teaching moments with the kids. The movie was fabulous, but the after effects in the family are great too. My daughter, who normally doesn't like to read, asked me to get her the book, which she gobbled up in days.

Almost everything that made the book a great read was left out of the movie.  I give the characters and acting five stars, but for content compared to the book, it should get about two and a half stars.  Everything that happened in the movie happened in the book almost word for word, but so much was left out  I realize that time was restrictive to the telling of the story, but everything that was left out was the truth of things that really happened during that time in history, and made the movie feel ""dumbed down"" or afraid to portray the truths of history.  It will be a great movie for teachers to show in history classes if the students also have to read the book. The acting was outstanding, I expected the Rudy character to be a bit older and a little more mature. Other things, the ""book thief"" only steals one book from the ""library"", the conversation with the Mayor's wife and the ghost of her brother aren't seen.

5803124,4,B00DHJT5Q6,I was really pleasantly surprised by how well this book translated to the screen. I was definitely skeptical going in - the book was so imbedded in the prose and a difficult concept to grapple with as it is narrated by Death.

I loved the movie within itself, but in comparison to the book it left out major key points that i feel were important to the story.  I found myself only concentrating on what they didn't put in, but then again I know all movies leave out things from the book.  That is just my opinion.

Jeffrey Rush, Emily Watson and Sophie Nelisse are terrific, as is the rest of the ensemble. The utilization of ""Death"" as the narrator worked very well.

5803268,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"As an author who has deeply loved writing her entire life this movie epitomizes the heart of loving the written word and the incredible value and contribution authors gift to the world at large. The concept of the Nazi regime keeping others from expanding their minds and exploring the possibilities life has to offer still rings true in some segments of society even today. Authors and writers offer the opportunity to reconsider life on so many levels. It is what links us together as humans...the ideas we each carry and our willingness to not impose those ideas but rather offer them in our own voice, in our own way, while at the same time giving others permission to trust their authenticity to think and create. The movie and the book are equally brilliant and one that I recommend to the writers I coach. It holds a space in my heart library, keeping company with other books I love such as ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" Malcolm Gladwell's books and the ""Harry Potter"" series. A good story teller opens up the world like no one else can and ""The Book Thief"" holds that promise: to open you up, touch your heart, and maybe even change how you see life.

5803295,4,B00DHJT5Q6,"Having grandparents that lived (and survived) during this hellish time in history and hearing them speak of some of the atrocities they experienced first hand, it was a bit hard to relate some of the story line to heretofore related stories.  However, everyone's rememberances and experiences are obviously diversified.  The one thing I could relate to is my grandfather's vivid, ""almost like yesterday"" recollection of the Nazi's book burning and reading censorship they had to endure as well as being hungry all the time due to lack of food availability.  I think these things alone contributed a great deal to my grandparent's home being filled with good books and other reading literature, my grandfather's insatiable appetite for reading and my grandmother's food gardening and subsequent canning and preserving of food stuffs.  Like the line from ""Gone With The Wind"", I heard my grandmother say many times that she wanted to make sure that none of the family..."" would ever go hungry again"".",1419552000,3,998,5.1419753086419755

5803491,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"Being 82 years old, I have seen a lot of movies, and this one ranks right up with there with the best. Unlike one reviewer, my grandsons, age 14 & 18, who usually find it too hard to watch an entire movie, were engrossed. I had watched it before, but watched it again with them. I am buying  a DVD of this movie for my granddaughters, age 14 & 15, and I'll bet they will simply love it. Decent choices at the theater for those teenagers who don't talk like the common words inserted in movies to get a ""certain rating"" are hard to find. Is it any wonder you can hear the f word in most high school hallways?

How degrading that is, especially for girls. It used to be that junior high boys might use swear words while they were around other boys just like them, just to show how ""tough"" they were. But when a girl was close enough to hear, the language was cleaned up. That's gone now, and apparently nobody cares. After all it's just words, isn't it? Sorry, I swerved off the review.

I agree with another reviewer who said, ""Why can't Hollywood make movies like this anymore""? It is very difficult to find a movie, even at the local library, which isn't degrading to most decent people, and filled with language which is embarrassing to anyone with a brain.

Some will say, ""Well, that's just being realistic"". Nonsense. This movie depicted war at it's worst; with inhuman treatment of Jews, and with suffering and death everywhere. Could you be any more realistic than that? The emotion in this movie was handled with great expertise, and the direction was outstanding.

Movies can be uplifting, like some of the greatest were, without depicting every degrading thing that actually occurred.",1417132800,5,1694,4.559210526315789

This film shows the humanity of the ordinary Germans who suffered under Nazi rule and how they retained their humanity in the face of such odds against their government and the destruction of their lives and property when the allies brought the full might of destruction to Germany itself. This film moved me to tears and dramatized the suffering of those who had no voice and whose stories are forgotten by history. This film brings the face of humanity to war and should remind the viewer that the first casualty of any war is those who have no voice, Those most victimized by the arrogance of their leaders who are all too eager to march to war.

5803641,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"After almost 1900 other reviews, there's probably not much I can add that will be new.  But here goes.

I loved this movie for its focus on the story - i.e., the character development (as a future writer) of a young girl living in WWII Germany.  The main character (Liesel) is encouraged in her writing by a Jew (""Max Vandenburg"") who her foster parents are hiding in their basement.  But she is also influenced by all of the other aspects of life in WWII Germany, including her foster parents, her neighbors, and her friends.  This is pretty much like real-life - i.e., life is a compilation of experiences, and not just the result of a single encounter.  I applaud the film for not digressing into the typical rant against the mistreatment of Jews by the Germans - there have been enough of those films to last us a lifetime.  The film speaks for itself in that respect by credible depictions of day-to-day life in Germany during the war.

The movie does not digress from the main story line (which it could easily have done by including gratuitous romance, violence and general anti-Nazi scenes), but rather maintains its focus on Liesel and her development (as influenced by her own personal experiences during this troubled time).  For this alone I would give the movie a 4-star rating.  But the acting, cinematography, soundtrack (mostly non-obtrusive, for which kudos are in order), and conservative use of special effects moves this film up to the 5-star category.  There is nothing about this film that I dislike or would change.  It is a wonderful story without being preachy.  In the end, it is just a story (and a wonderful one at that), and viewers can take from it what they will, without being force-fed some ostensible moralistic pabulum.  In a rare instance Hollywood has produced a film which allows the viewers to just enjoy the story, and to draw their own conclusions as to any morals to be derived therefrom.

Make no mistake - this is not the ""movie version"" of the book.  They are two separate and distinct works of art, and generally tell two different stories.  Kudos to Michael Petroni for his screenplay in adapting the novel to the big screen.  Both the book and the movie are wonderful, and (in my opinion) stand as separate works worthy of equal praise.  (Think ""Gone With the Wind"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", and other great books that have been make into great films, but don't necessarily track film-to-book.)  I loved the book, and I loved the movie - equally and separately.",1415664000,4,2504,4.712643678160919

5803782,3,B00DHJT5Q6,"The Book Thief is an astounding and complex novel. It is a tale of a girl in Nazi Germany who is sent to live with her foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann, after her mother is found to be a communist and is sent away. All the while, the Hubermanns are hiding a Jew in their basement and Liesel, the main character, is stealing books and learning to read.

With that summary, let me explain first why I disliked the movie. I'll explain why I liked it after. Firstly, I understand that no book-to-movie adaptation will ever do justice to its origin piece. After all, novels tend to be long, descriptive, and in most cases, intricate. The Book Thief is no exception. I try not be critical, but in this case I was sorely disappointed with the director. Major plot points were missed that I felt were important to the story line. Note: contains some spoiler. For starters, Liesel is a ""Book Thief."" She steals books and reads them. But you see, that's not all there is to it. She shares these books, these words with the people around her. For instance, during the air raids, in the novel, it is not Hans who helps the people to keep calm, but Liesel. There is not music, but words that fill that basement. This book is not about a man with an accordion, but a girl with books she has stolen and wishes to share with others who are willing to listen. The entire point is to show the power words have over everything else.

The second flaw is Max. Max is a wonderful character in both the book and movie. I grew attached to him in both actually. But I noticed a key element missing in him. That would be the two books he writes for Liesel. Why do I think it's important? Liesel first befriends Max over the book Mien Kampf, which ironically saves his life (though they don't explain how in the movie). He eventually uses this book to write a story for Liesel, which was a way of showing his relationship with her. The second was given later on by Rosa who was asked to hold on to it until Liesel was ready to receive it. It's called ""The Word Shaker."" Quite frankly I thought this was a key element to the story, especially if the director wasn't going to show Liesel's thieving and sharing of literature. The second story tells of Liesel's profound effect on the world around her because of how she uses language. It shows that Hitler had power because he knew how to use words better than others, but Liesel was better because, unlike Hitler, she didn't keep them for herself. Now I'll admit, I think the movie would still do fine without Max's stories, but if I'm being honest, I feel that Liesel's power over human language and how she uses to connect with those around her is lacking in this film. I felt they could have done better and instead of adding scenes that don't exist in the novel, try to put in major scenes that existed to begin with.

Third, and lastly (because this review could on forever if I pointed out all the discrepancies), Death as the narrator. He was pretty much nonexistent for an entity that gets around. He's Death. In the novel, he is the one who tells Liesel's story. How does he know about Liesel and everything she went through? He has no time to be around for every little thing she did. Of course, the book points out that Death can only tell the whole story because of the diary she wrote and lost towards the end of the novel. Not only that, but he's important because he's trying to tell himself why humans are worth the effort, using Liesel to prove to himself that humans are complicated in their ugliness and beauty. He not only talks about Liesel's life, but other important characters as well, like Hans, Rosa, Max, Rudy,etc. He shows us what happened before, during, and after Liesel. As Death, he is the one who takes a step back and shows us how they all tie together. In the movie, it was like he wasn't there to begin with. When he did talk, it was like he was making a side note rather than telling us from his point of view. It was very awkward to listen to him because it was so broken up.

As I said before, I didn't necessarily like, but I didn't outright hate it either. There could have been improvement, but as far as capturing the essence of novel, the movie did an okay job. I still sobbed at the end (though not as badly, because they messed up with Rudy--not going into that since that's another long paragraph). I still saw the ties Liesel had to Rosa and Hans, Rudy and Max. You could tell how each one was important to her. You sense the tension of the war on both the family and the rest of Molching. I had the same feelings watching this movie as I did reading the book. Overall, this movie wasn't a total failure, but I probably won't watch it again. I'll stick to the book and how the next time I read it, I'll probably end up reopening the wounds it has caused on my soul, whereas this movie only left a tiny paper cut.",1412899200,4,4889,4.339890710382513

5803818,3,B00DHJT5Q6,"I feel like I'm the only one who thought this movie lacked more storyline. I LOVED the characters and setting. But I felt like we didn't get the whole story. When Liesel (spelling?) goes to read books at the wealthy home, after she is caught, the story just ends about that. There is no follow up or anything else about the matter. Then I kept expecting something to happen between Liesel and her best friend Rudy. I was sure they would grow up to be in love, or that Rudy would turn into some big Natzi and that would in turn tear their friendship apart. But nothing happened. Instead Rudy just one day dies, along with Liesel's whole family. Then one day Max decides to leave, and you never hear about him again until the very end, and even then its one brief moment. When the movie was about over, I seriously thought it was going to show us more. I thought maybe it would show them grown up. I was sadly dissapointed, and maybe the book was better or had more storyline to it, not sure.",1412726400,,990,4.2994652406417115

5803851,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"This is a wonderful movie, but if you don't like to be reminded of war, you might not be as interested in this movie. It takes place in Hitler's very repressive Germany during World War Two.

I'm a member of a wonderful library that lets me borrow DVD's from all over South Carolina. If you're trying to save money, ask your library if you can expand your online search with statewide data.

I watched it twice on DVD
  1. with captions turned on, because sometimes the sound is soft in key places
  2. with descriptive audio service turned on

The descriptive audio service helped me understand a few scenes. For example, the white lump in Rosa's hand when Liesel first enters her new home is a lump of sugar. I did not catch that before.

With the help of her new ""Papa,"" Liesel not only learns to read, but learns to love books.

She manages to get books in ways that other people do not understand.
* A gravedigger accidentally drops his gravedigging manual on the fire burning near where her brother was just buried. Liesel rescues the book.
* The Nazis do a book burning as a demonstration against the intelligentsia. After it's over and everyone else is gone, Liesel finds one book smoldering at the edge of the fire, but it is substantially okay, so she grabs it secretly.
* When the Burgermeister's wife is no longer allowed to let Liesel enjoy their large library, Liesel manages to sneak into the library through an unlocked window so she can borrow a book. Even though she is hungry because of the war, she only wants to borrow a book.

BUT here is where one of the deleted scenes makes for a better movie.

The Burgermeister's wife figures out that Liesel borrowed a book, so she leaves a book and some food right by the window, so Liesel can borrow the book without needing to climb in the room, and so that Rudy can take the food that is sitting next to the book.

I wish they had left this scene in the movie. It makes it a better movie.

This is a good movie. I highly recommend it.",1412121600,,1999,4.384823848238482

5803939,4,B00DHJT5Q6,"When one thinks about Nazi Germany and books in the late 1930s and 1940s one almost always thinks about those frenzied crowds of ordinary citizens, flames flickering in their faces to create an even  more disturbing picture,  hovering over a bonfire as a group, maybe the Nazi youth, or some local SS troops keep adding book fuel to the fire. Tossing all those Jew books, those Enlightenment books, those modernist books to the fires as if an idea once planted can be burned out in such a way. And of course in the film under review, the adaptation from the book, The Book Thief, there is just such scene. But that is only prologue here because what this film is about, or one of the things that it is about, is stealing books in order to learn more about the world, or just for the pleasure of reading.

The plotline here is pretty straight forward once you get past the fact that the grim reaper is the narrator of this one, a narrator who will unfortunately have plenty of close-at hand business before the story is done between the round-up of the local Jews, the deaths of soldiers on the various fronts, and the retaliation bombings by the Allies later in the film. But what interests Brother Death is this one story, this story of a young illiterate orphan girl, Liesel, whose mother, a communist, another group targeted for extinction by the Nazis, has to leave her behind. Leaves her with foster parents, Hans (a good guy from the beginning) and Rosa (who starts out as a grump but warms up to Liesel over time). The main problem early on is for Hans to teach Liesel how to read and thus opening up her universe during the night of the long knives.

Along the way Liesel meets a neighborhood boy, Rudy, and they become fast friends just at that awkward boy meets girl stage with all the puppy love stuff thrown in. During the film Liesel and Rudy become close, close enough for Liesel to eventually tell Rudy about a young Jewish man who Hans and Rosa are hiding in order to repay an old debt (and who is forced to leave after a couple of years in the basement as the authorities start looking for air-raid shelters and whom Liesel will meet again after the war since he survived); who takes Rudy on her adventures to the mayors house to steal books for her reading pleasure; and helps him overcome the fears of the air-raid shelters when the Allies start their bombing runs to break the German civilian populations support for Hitler by telling stories. In the end though Brother Death works in strange ways since everybody who Liesel cared about, her foster-parents, Rudy, and other neighborhood people, were killed in an miscalculated bombing attack toward the end of the war. As the film closes and Brother Death sums up his work, work eventually including Liesel who lived to be 90 and to have prospered after the war moving to New York City, he is still baffled by the human experiment. As are we I would add.",1410998400,2,2924,4.53219696969697

5803946,4,B00DHJT5Q6,"The Book Thief is placed in Germany during World War ll through the perspective of a child. Young nine-year-old liesel had just moved in with new foster parents, without being aware why, she acted shy and kept to herself. Her foster mother, Rosa, was rather demanding and not very compassionate. On the other hand her foster father, Hans, had the heart of a little kid and just wanted Liesel to enjoy herself.
Once Hans taught her to read she became fascinated with books and reading, so much so that she even stole, or as she saw it borrowed books. A runaway Jewish man, who was a family friend, showed up at their doorstep begging for help. The runaways name was Max and the family decided to do everything they could to hide and help him survive. Being in bed all the time, and the cold caused Max to become very ill. With the faith of Liesel and her constant reading to him, Max survived and fully recovered.  After living with the family, and depending on them for two years he decided it was time to stop putting everybody else in danger, so he left in order to protect them.
Hans then got a letter from the military requesting his help. The absence of Liesel's foster father caused the house to feel empty and lifeless. With Hans return the story seemed to brighten and became positive again. As Liesel's parents went to sleep upstairs, she decided she was going to go in the basement to write the story about her life and what had taken place in it so far. She accidentally fell asleep while writing.
 In the middle of the night her whole street got bombed and everybody who was above ground level was killed. Liesel's love of books is the only thing that saved her life that night. The story ends showing how she grew up making the most of everything she was given and she died like most should, due to old age.
The Book Thief is far different from any other World War ll movie. Brian Percival's idea to use a child's perspective was what made it so different. This movie seems very accurate from the point of view of a child. In a situation like the holocaust, children are not always fully aware of what is going on around them. Parents usually choose to keep their children in the dark.
 Another portion that made it interesting was having death as the narrator. Portraying death as the narrator shows how close death was during the World War ll to every country involved. It is a concept that is present in any war, that there is a possibility that death could strike at any time.",1410825600,,2493,4.450765864332604

Loosely based and the name should of been changed for the movie, because the adaptation is almost a story of itself and not the book.  Marcus Zusak writes an amazing story, through the life of a child in WWII Hitlers Germany.  A story that was written for tweens and is absorbing to adults, too.  Zusak writes with great description that is multidimensional, the movie is barely one dimensional and should of been a mini series to bring all the dimensions of this great story.  Most here have written the acting was amazing.  It is hard to tell because there was not a lot of acting required in this version.  I was not expecting the movie to be able to cover all of the 550 pages of the book, but again it is a shame to even attempt this in a 2 hour and 11 minute movie.

5804086,2,B00DHJT5Q6,"We all know that a movie will never be exactly as the book but I was really disappointed in how this movie was done. My recommendation.....definitely read the book. The movie was missing so many key elements....Liesel looking among the jews for Max, the time she spent in the Mayor's wife library, her kiss to Rudy, her relationship with Papa, they even changed the name of one of the books Liesel had stolen. If they had just focused on one of these elements I probably would have given it a higher rating.

It's a must see movie for anyone who likes to explore the human condition in the worst of times- Geoffrey Rush is superb as is his co-star and the actress who plays the little girl, (whose name escapes me right now) just a superb job of acting and portraying those dark times surrounding WW2.

very involving and emotional.  Also liked that it dealt with the Nazi's from the point of view of the Germans rather than the Americans.

the cast is first-rate and the young actress, Sophie Nlisse absolutely steals the show.

So we bought the movie so he could get his arms around the story.  Movie was 5 stars as far as the plot and actors performance and it is easy to understand why it is highly rated.  The Nazi persecution of the Jews was well illustrated and a reminder that genocide is always lurking nearby.  But I prefer scifi and action oriented movies.

Set in WW II Nazi Germany, it  seems to portray a kind of childhood romance. The true horror of the brutal extermination of Jews is softened. For this reason, it reminded me of ""A Beautiful Life"", which was likewise a whitewashing of a piece of history that should remain starkly honest for future generations.

If you want to watch a movie that takes place in Europe during WW II and that dramatizes life (and death) for Jews at that time, watch The Pianist. Someone I know who survived the death camps told me that it is an accurate portrayal.",1407369600,4,658,4.475

Personally I found the movie to be trash down there with Avatar the last airbender by M. Night Shamalan but that's only because as I read the book I became emotionally attached to characters that in the movie  you just don't care for if I had seen the movie first I would have grouped it with many B rated movies because It tries to fit an entire book in the span of 2 hours the actors looked well when I saw Hans I was happy with how well the director and the author captured his look, his personality however ehh... it wasn't the best there are some parts in the movie where you just want to scream because the acting becomes appalling I realize it's not the actors fault they had to manipulate the story because there wasn't enough screen time. I just wish that Directors would realize that they'll never give books or their stories justice unless they split the movies into at least two parts (two separate movies).",1406419200,,1035,4.4188481675392675

5804407,3,B00DHJT5Q6,"If you want an Oscar, an easy route is to write, direct, or star in a film about World War II. Audiences love the sense of triumph derived from a small personal story within the larger context of conflict, and theyll tend to stick with the story even if its message about the strength of moral character in the face of evil seems stale and clich&eacute;d. Moviegoers eat that stuff up  usually. Every now and then a movie gets it wrong though, and at the point the schmaltz just becomes so thick the audience cant choke it down, and thats where The Book Thief gets caught. It goes down the checklist and marks everything off, but it does so with such an obvious and mechanical manner that the sentimental moments feel cold and overly calculated.

Amidst the growingly hostile nationalism fueled by the Nazi party in Germany, the young Liesel Meminger (Sophie Nelisse) settles in to her new life with new parents (Geoffrey Rush, Emily Watson) after her mother sent her away. As Liesel becomes accustomed to her new school and life in the city, she grows fascinated with the written word, and soon her new father is teaching her to read. Its a task made more difficult by the rise in book burnings by the Nazi party, which inspires Liesel to rescue any books she can from the literary funeral pyres and share them with anyone who will listen (without reporting her to the authorities). Her rebellious and curious spirit finds kinship in her new parents who have a similar secret of their own.

Have you ever felt like a film was trying way too hard to make an audience applaud? Thats the tone of The Book Thief from start to finish. Its sincerity goes only as far as necessary to make people feel good about the human spirits ability to overcome adversity in small ways, and then it stops abruptly lest it say anything too profound or unique that might make people take notice of it and study it with any real scrutiny. The performances are all quite good, its just that the script has them saying and acting out all of the most clich&eacute;d characters a WWII film could have. Nelisses character takes a little bit longer to fall into one of the stock characters, but by the end shes that cookie cutter child embodiment of all the things we should never let society oppress.

The Book Thief has all of the right visual production values that youd expect from an Academy Award-worthy film, but none of the necessary effort where its needed most: in the script.

For the most part very engaging, but I found it sort of meandering in the middle and wanted it to move along or give me more to think about.

I'm not familiar with the book so I do not n=know how it stands up next to it. As a film it is very good, maybe not one I would need to revisit more than a second time. With films like Schindler's List and The Pianist to compare it to, it's got some stiff competition.

5804471,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"I loved The Book Thief.  Here's some reasons why:

Casting is VERY good.  In particular, Sophie Nlisse and Nico Liersch, who play Liesel and Rudy.  Both have excellent acting skills, especially for being so young.  They are perfect.  Of course, the rest of the cast is good as well, with Geoffrey Rush as Hans, Emily Watson as Rosa, and some others whose names I forget.  The only actor I slightly objected to was Ben Schnetzer, who played Max.  I think they could have done a little better. Still, not too far off.

I really enjoy the subtlety of the acting.  Nothing is more distracting than having even just one actor over-acting.  I didn't feel that way about any of the characters, which was great.  Not that they were boring or unemotional; they are anything but boring, and show emotion where they should.

Of course, the story is wonderfull.  Here the credit goes to both Marcus Zusak for writing the book, and whoever translated it into movie form.  It came off as true the original book, with a few minor alterations.  Alterations include changing who says what line, or the title of a book Liesel read.

I only have two small complaints.  First, I didn't like the narrator's (death's) voice.  It sounds too much like the usual creepy voice that we attribute to death.  It goes against the different character that Zusak gave to Death.  Second, I wish they had included more Liesel and Rudy's stealing trips.  But that's it!

The Book Thief is really, really good.  So watch it!",1405728000,,1488,4.656370656370656

5804659,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"This is a masterful, beautiful, and remarkably made film based on Markus Zusak's young adult novel. It is a seriously underrated movie that came out under the radar screen, but should be seen by anyone who enjoys well-made movies with excellent acting and intelligent scripting.

The story takes place in World War II Germany, and follows Liesel (Sophie Nelisse) who goes to live with adoptive parents (Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson), and learns about life, love, and the power of books while living through the hideous events of Nazi Germany. Within this simply narrative is a complex weaving of thought-provoking themes, from self-sacrifice and finding courage to discovering the power of reading and words, as well as the moral dilemma of what to do when you are living in a society that is doing things and speaking things that you know are wrong, but you have little control over it.

The cast couldn't be more perfect, with Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson in usual excellent form as the working class adoptive parents, Ben Schnetzer as the handsome young Jewish man hiding in the basement, Nico Liersch in a terrific youthful performance as Liesel's friend Rudy, and most of all, Sophie Nelisse as Liesel. Liesel is a very complex character, innocent and timid on the one hand, but courageous and bold on the other, with an inner fire that grows as the story progresses. Sophie portrays all of these qualities perfectly, with a lovely young face full of wonder and confusion that seems to keep you mesmerized throughout the entire film.

The telling of the tale is geared for young adults (maybe a bit intense for smaller children), and the terrifying events of World War II are depicted appropriately and realistically, giving the viewer a slightly claustrophobic feel, a feeling of what it would have really been like to be a simple peasant living in Nazi Germany, with no way to escape and little way of fully understanding what was going on around you. The heroes of the story are left to their own consciences and hearts to discover that what is going on around them is evil.

Wonderfully scripted, with lovingly bleak scenery and a delicate, haunting score by master composer John Williams, The Book Thief is a winner from beginning to end, and a terrific story for young people (and adults as well), depicting themes and qualities that seldom show up in most movies for young people. Instead of the usual promotion of sex, selfishness, and rebellion, The Book Thief promotes honor, loyalty, sacrifice, compassion, and the bittersweet reminder to make the most of your life, because nobody lives forever.

5804664,2,B00DHJT5Q6,"As I read the novel by author 'Markus Zusak' I was thrusted into the world of Liesel Meminger. A emotional connecting, solidly characterized, and powerfully written book. And right after finishing the book, I read that the film adaption had begun production. I was overjoyed to see an excellent tale of courage and friendship would come to life on the big screen. Unfortunately the film never showed at my Cinema when November 27th clocked in. So here I am, April 13th watching 'The Book Thief'. Was it all that I had hoped and prayed for, or what I have come to expect from film adaptions of my beloved books? I'd take the later, for this tale. My review of 'The Book Thief'.

 'The Book Thief' follows Liesel Meminger, a poor unfortunate girl who is thrusted into the hands of foster parents Hans and Rosa Hubermann (Played by Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson), after her mother was forced to abandon her and her late brother (who died on the way there), as she was a communist. Taking place from the beginning to the end of Hitler's rain, the film (Narrated by Death) tells Liesel's story of hope, courage, and her love for books.

It's a very intriguing story, having it narrated by death. It doesn't take very long to realize this as the film's first line is 'You're all going to die."" The narrating works to set up the characters and get you invested more as the film's opening is rather dull without the narration. The narration comes in short snippets throughout the film, until its closing monologue at the end, summing everything up. It's somewhat chilling and creepy, which is effective in a good way. But seems rather un-necessary altogether and is access weight to the film that already stretches past a bearable runtime, and instead leap farther into a slow 2 hours plus film.

The film on a technical stand point is very strong. The visual effects are both beautiful and show loads of craftsmanship, what with the detail of everything imaginable, the snow and houses, it's all beautifully rendered with care.

The film looks like a newly designed fabric. It's soft and pleasing to touch and hear and feel, and that's good and all, but it makes for a more comfy experience when the film tries to become serious, it just can't be taken that way. It try's dramatically to succeed but it doesn't, it's just too puppy like.

The script has too much on its mind as well. It slacks often. When it's trying to be serious, it's not, and when it's trying to be funny, it's not. The script's dialogue is uninspired and cringworthy beyond be leaf for a film like this. The script winds up just slopping about, jumping us into random places, without any explanation.
The film tries often, way too hard to be good, and instead falls on its head from exhaustion. Dramatically the film holds well, but it wears itself out from so much trying, it doesn't let itself just go with it. It follows the book well enough, but never adds what would be useful to successfully adapt the book to a feature length film.

This may have been made up by the performances, and should have but it wasn't. The cast is fine, but wasn't enough to save the story from being a hopeless mess. 'Geoffrey Rush' shines as the lovably soft, foster father of Liesel, and so does 'Emily Watson' as the bittersweet, no-nonsense foster mother, with a heart hidden underneath all the sternness. Newcomer 'Sophie Nelisse' was brilliantly cast as our heroine, Liesel Meminger a brave and strong young girl.

The score from 'John Williams' and the cinematography from 'Florian Ballhaus' both succeed to dramatically tone the film beautifully.

All and all, 'The Book Thief' is visually beautiful, dramatically successful due to the strong score and cinematography, but the uninspired script pulls the film down from truly being good. C- 4/13/14

'The Book Thief' is rated PG-13 for some intense violence. It's appropriate for children 12 and up.",1404691200,,3907,4.732352941176471

I lived in Germany for 16 years and there are genuinely warm and humane people like those portrayed in the movie. A wonderful - wonderful movie event.,1404259200,,355,4.650793650793651

5804785,4,B00DHJT5Q6,"The movie is well done but does not reveal everything disclosed in the book.  I felt the movie was perhaps more sensitive to the audience about the violence but the movie made it seem like Liesel told stories for only one air raid, when in fact she was the story teller repeatedly in the book.  They dismissed the apple stealing which I think reminded us of how hard food was to come by in those war years.  It is an excellant tale and although the movie did not discuss the colors of death, it was made very clear at the end of the movie it was Death that was sharing this story and how he is haunted by humans.

5804851,5,B00DHJT5Q6,I did not like the book as I found it very difficult to follow but the film more than made up for it. A great story well-told and executed by incredible performances.,1404000000,2,166,4.21875
5804852,4,B00DHJT5Q6,"Director Brian Percival brings Markus Zusak's novel to the big screen in a delicate and artful way.  The film is seen from the eyes of young Liesel (Sophie Neilsse in big blue-eyed performance) although ""Death"" (Roger Allam) is the occasional narrator.  That fact alone suggests that there will be an ominous tone to the story.  That and the setting is 1938 Nazi Germany.

In a beautiful opening shot we see a speeding train negotiating the winter snowy countryside.  ""Death"" is guiding us to Liesel, her brother and her mother.  But on this day he is coming for the little boy.  After a hastily dug grave is dug alongside the tracks, a small book drops from the grave digger's pocket.  Liesel quickly scoops it up.  We learn later that Liesel's mother (Heike Makatsch) was taking the children to live with foster parents (and strangers) in a small village near Munich.  The mother is a Communist sympathizer and is therefore protecting her children by giving them away.

Hans Hubermann (Jeffrey Rush) and his wife Rosa (Emily Watson) are the childless couple that adopt the young girl, essentially to collect a stipend from the government.  Both are self-employed.  Hans, a painter and Rosa does laundry.  Hans quickly warms up to the girl, grumpy Rosa not so much at first.  She's upset in that she was expecting 2 children.  Hans's retorts something to the effect that it's not Liesel's fault her brother died.

Liesel catches the eye of another 12 year old, a boy named Rudy (Nico Liersch) who lives next door.  At school on her first day, we learn Liesel is illiterate.  Rudy and Liesel become best friends and defend each other throughout the movie, both verbally and physically.  With the Nazi purge underway, the Hubermann's reluctantly take in a young man of about 19 or 20.  He's Max Vandenburg, the son of a Jewish soldier who saved Hans's life in World War I.  Hans had promised him as he died, he would look after his son if and when the time came.  It did and he did.

Hans, recognizing Liesel's reading shortcomings teaches her and she quickly learns.  Her hunger to read is so profound, she ""borrows"" books from the burgermeister's wife.  Max creates a dictionary of sorts on the walls of the basement.  She adds new words in chalk as she learns them.  Max, being hidden in the basement, becomes a great friend and inspiration of Liesel's, teaching her how to describe in detail what she sees.  These are some great scenes.

I've seen some criticisms of the film that it doesn't graphically depict the horrors of the Nazi's.  I would argue that it is indeed shown, but that every movie about this period doesn't have to be ""Schindler's List.""  And not every German agreed with Hitler.  I would agree that the ""Death"" narration gives the film a sense of fantasy and perhaps a less serious tone.  But ""Death"" does show up in full catch-up mode in the film's final act.  I found it to be a poignant, touching ending that at first will have you pushing away a tear but ultimately is one of profound joy.

When a few years pass and Liesel reunites with Max, we're are left to guess what happens to him, but I've written my own ending which is what I expect the writers wanted.  This is an excellent film, perhaps a bit slow at times and a little long.  But it is beautifully shot, well directed and includes some superior acting from Watson, Rush and young Sophie Nelisse.  You'll be hearing more from her.  John Williams provides a gorgeous score.  Highly recommended.

The Blu ray transfer comes with a 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  It is just about as good as it gets.  There is a wide range of dimensions in the film that going from the opening snowy scene to the drab and dingy Hubermann basement.  It comes across perfectly with excellent contrast and detail.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is equally excellent.  Like the video, the audio components range from relative quiet village streets to massive bombing attacks by the Allies.  It is all properly rendered throughout the soundfield as is the excellent Williams score.  Subtitles are numerous including English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Arabic, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Estonian, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Icelandic, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, Romanian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Turkish, Ukrainian.  Extras include: Deleted Scenes (1080p; 6:34) and A Hidden Truth: Bringing The Book Thief to Life (1080p; 31:05) and a trailer.",1404000000,6,4443,4.827586206896552

A few pages into the book I had forgotten though that it was actually death telling the story. As a German-Australian I enjoyed the unbiased view of Germans that the author presented. He showed that there were not only bad Germans (and I know that there were many) at the time but some good ones as well. Like everyone else I  bawled my eyes out in parts, but if a book can move a person that much, it must mean that it was written well.

5805016,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"The lessons of the Third Reich and the Holocaust cannot be overstated.  Almost seventy years since the end of World War II witnesses to the atrocities of the Germans are dwindling to a few.  The makers of ""The Book Thief"" have an interesting take on what occurred at that time.  Seen through the eyes of a young girl, Liesel (Sophie Nelisse), the film begins prior to the invasion of Poland and ends when hostilities between the superpowers ends.  Liesel begins the film as a fragile and frightened illiterate young girl taken from a mother with Communist sympathies to a young woman wizened to the horrors humanity is capable of but assured of her own moral compass.  The setting of the film is the picaresque village Liesel goes to live with her adoptive parents, Hans (Geoffrey Rush) and Rosa (Emily Watson), and it serves as a microcosm of the cancer that infected the Fatherland.  Liesel sees with eyes agape everything from a book burning to commemorate Der Fuhrer's birthday to Jews being marched though her town to their ultimate fate in the concentration camps.  Nelisse  giving a sterling performance anchors the film quite nicely.  The supporting cast is uniformly excellent with a special shout out to young Nico Liersch who plays Liesel's friend, Rudy, a boy who emulates the African-American track star Jesse Owens.  The beauty of the film is it works on an adult level but should be accessible to older adolescents and teenagers.  This film serves as a primer to a time in our history we cannot and should not forget.",1402790400,7,1532,4.809160305343512

Interesting take on World War II and the documented thefts of millions of paintings and other artifacts taken by the Nazis during their destruction in Europe.

I appreciated the reality of the times - krystalnacht, the Jew hidden in the apt, the relationship that develops between the character and the young man who is hidden, even the wife of the German officer who allows the young girl to read her books in defiance of her husband.  They were certainly difficult times and that reality is in the backdrop of this movie.  It is a terrific movie.",1402358400,,503,4.423913043478261

5805105,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"When I watched the trailer, I knew I wanted to see the movie.  The atrocities of that time period are frightening and oftentimes stories that come out of that time just weigh really hard on my heart.  It was easy to settle into the characters and live the story alongside them, despite the adversities they faced.  It is the way they handled their adversities that triumphed, even in the saddest of moments.  I seem to be handing out 5-stars lately and I don't do that very often as I leave room for 'better'.  Definitely 5-star drama.",1402358400,,535,4.53125

5805118,3,B00DHJT5Q6,"I watched the movie before finishing the audio book. The screen play departs too much from book. Perhaps Book Thief would be better as episodes on Masterpiece Theater so characters and plot can develop. The acting was very good but more German could have been used.

5805119,3,B00DHJT5Q6,"I have not read the book--which might have clarified parts of the movie The Book Thief, the story of a young adopted child, living in Nazi Germany. The movie seemed confusing to me, and it was only at  the end, I realized the story was narrated by Death.

The relationship of Liesel and Max, a Jewish man, was short-changed somehow, and if you're a stickler for realism, this movie will NOT be for you--there is all too much unexplained, and far too coincidental.  I'll probably not read the book, since it seemed to me to be more gimmick, than literary treat. A strength of the movie is the acting--what's not to like about Geoffery Rush? and young Sophie Nelisse is very fine. I recommend this movie with qualifications.",1402358400,,722,4.625

5805191,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"I watched this movie with my 13 year old son. It is a beautiful movie, with great actors, and well made. It is about a girl that was given up by her mother during the Nazi time, possibly because her mother was a communist and knew she wasn't going to be safe, so she gave away her children for adoption. The main character, Liesl, had a little brother that died and didn't make it to the adoptive parents. The adoptive mother is initially portrayed as a very selfish, cold woman, who only cared about getting money from the government for the children they were adopting. But as the story goes by she fell in love with Liesl as well. Throughout the end of the movie we see Liesl's journey and all her losses. It is a very heartwarming story as all the characters were filled with love towards one another, although very sad due to the Nazi, but it shows what a great character Liesl was and how she always put her heart in the right place.",1401926400,,939,4.3107344632768365

In Germany during WWII, Liesel (Sophie Nlisse), age 9, is sent to live with foster parents (Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson). She earns her title of  the book thief after borrowing books from the mayors wifes library.

What did I think?

There is a lot going on in this film and it sometimes feels like it moves too quickly to form meaningful relationships. This is remedied completely by the end, and the relationships are actually what make this film so beautiful. The narration by Death (Roger Allam) felt a little tedious to begin with (and seriously, Back to the Future owns the flying through clouds opening shot - leave it alone), but it all ties together in one of the most moving final shots of a film I've ever seen. Ever.

Jeffrey Rush was phenomenal as the hen pecked husband who brings a frightened young girl into their family fold during WW II and helps her grow up in a way that brings joy and love into everyone's life through her love of books.

I also thought it had more depth and I enjoyed the story more than the Diary of Ann Frank.  The relationship between the father/daughter and her friend was well developed and it was easy to engender empathy for all of them.

The relationship she develops with the Mayor's wife was also interesting and added to her emotional growth.

I thought the selections for the movie were well-suited to their parts, however, I found them not as sympathetic as the book characters.  As always, there's the conundrum of what to include in the movie when there is so much happening in the book; but I think the aspects that were covered were done very well.

I wanted to watch it in HD, but the last time I tried to watch a movie in HD, it got demoted to SD and I had paid for HD!  Worth the $4.99.  Will watch it again!",1401235200,,590,4.0

They only allowed people to read the propaganda and not regular books. They burned all of the books in the street. An uneducated person will believe  what ever is told to them where one that is educated knows better. She was given to another family to save her life as she was part jewish. Her new family had a mom that was not so kind and dad that was very sensitive to her. She watched her brother literally freeze to death on the train to Germany. This was a very involved story and one that makes you think of how easy life can change. Her treasure in life was to be allowed to read books on a private library.

The movie compared to the book was sweeter and more palatable for an American-Californian to withstand the curtness of the relationships and absence of inter-cultural appreciation and tolerance.  Overall, the movie without reading the book is a 4 star, the movie with reading the book is borderline capturing the book (3 starts).  I still give it 4 stars because it's a good movie for a mature audience.
Takes a mature person to absorb all that is going on.  For the immature, watch it now, then watch it again 10 years from now.

5805333,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"This stands on its own as a beautifully made film and can be viewed as either original or a uniquely brilliant interpretation of the book.  The story is told with cinematic poetry,  with stunning imagery and lovely direction.  Deeply moving and incredibly powerful, it is unusual in depicting the experience of German civilians during WWII, a story seldom told.  The acting is superb and Emily Watson gives a truly inspired performance that is subtle and nuanced and never becomes caricature.  Her work in this film is among some of her finest and is a reminder of what a gifted actor she is.  Almost unrecognizable, her character is stern and seemingly cold until Watson slowly reveals the inner person.  Rosa is a much more complex character than what we see on the surface and the way the very human, loving person is revealed should have been recognized with an Oscar nomination for Watson.  But it's not the over-the-top, scenery chewing, attention grabbing, show boating one-shot, ""Look At ME, I'm ACTING"" appearance by an actress who disappears five minutes after the awards ceremony and never makes another decent movie, too often rewarded by the Academy.  This is a veteran artist doing what few other actors could.  She has the most difficult role in the film as it could easily have slipped into a stereotyped German hausfrau.  That is never allowed to happen and the way this wondrous actress achieves the difficult task of bringing the real Rosa to life is something to pay close attention to.  The entire cast is excellent but Emily Watson is absolutely fantastic.",1401148800,,1578,4.913207547169812

Maybe because it's wasn't about the Holocaust was the reason it had a low turn-out at the box office but nevertheless this film is worth seeing for it's goodness and the triumph of the human spirit over adversity.  The French Canadian actress Sophie Neeson is excellent as well as Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson as her uncle and aunt with special mention of the American actor who plays the Jewish youth whom they hide from the Nazis.

We loved the tenderness of the father towards his daughter, teaching her how to read.
The mother, over time changes in her heart towards this little girl, and the loving acceptance from the little girl

HOWEVER, this movie (I can't even call it a ""film""), was a flop in my opinion. I did not find Sophie Nelisse particularly suited to the role - I thought her acting was flat and could not get past the French accent on which she attempted, quite unsuccessfully to impose a German one. None of the characters were developed and I did not even both to watch the last half hour.  Rudi was a disappointment. These characters has life and determination in them.  What happened? This is on a par with a boring made-for-TV movie on Lifetime.  The only saving grace was Geoffrey Rush as Hans Huberman.

5805497,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"The Book Thief
One small fact: you are going to die. Despite every effort, no one lives forever. Sorry to be such a spoiler. My advice is when the time comes, don't panic. It doesn't seem to help.  Wisdom according to Death.

Film can be many things.  It can document an event, it can imagine a far away world, it can tell a story with an alternate ending, it can be a visual symphony and in the case of The Book Thief it can be allegorical poetry.  And with a John Williams score it can be sublime allegorical poetry.

In every sense of the word Brian Percival directs this production not as a WW2 period piece although the period of Hitlers Germany is everywhere.  We are used to such pieces being told from the point of view of victim, heroes, escapees or the Allied liberation.  We are not used to sympathizing with Nazis and here we are forced to.  But we are never often offered the point of view of Death as a character but if Death is a protagonist this is the film he was meant to star in.  Inded, Percival gives us Death as both narrator and subject of this ode to life.

Meet Liesl.  Her new adoptive parents Hans and Rosa.  Hans has a musical soul and Rosa is cloaked in thunder.  We meet Rudy and Franz, classmates of Liesl in her new school.  Rudy would have been her prom date in several years but Franz was just a schoolyard bully.  And we meet Ilsa, wife of the Burgermeister and caretaker of her dead sons library where books can be conviently stolen by Liesl, our book stealer.  And then theres Max.  The sun of a Jew who saved Hans life in WW1 by sacrificing his own.  They are hiding Max in their basement.  Max nearly dies but lives and leaves sacrificing his own safety so Liesl and her new family can live.

And because every symphonic allegorical poem, even of the sublime type, needs a climax Death does not hold back even as Death nonchalantly describes their last evening together:
No one intended to destroy a street named after Heaven that evening.  It was a misread on a map.  No sirens that evening.  First were Rudys brothers.  I wrapped their simple dreams.  Then I kissed his mother.  And stole the meanness from Franz Deutchers heart.  Rosa I caught mid snoreand I felt her regrets for not sharing more of her very big heart.  As for Hans his soul was lighter than a childs ..and I heard his final thought..Liesl.

Death continues, Rudy-  his soul just rolled into my arms.
As the rescue effort is underway we learn that Liesl lives and so does Max.  And again Death speaks:  Humans.  I see their ugliness and their beauty and I wonder how the same can be both.  All I know is that Im haunted by humans.

This film has entirely satisfying ending and is hauntingly beautiful.",1400371200,3,2710,4.3843058350100605
5805498,5,B00DHJT5Q6,This film took a wonderful book and made a worthy story to watch that was meaningful and entertaining. Make sure the tissues are handy.,1400371200,,135,4.666666666666667

I didn't quite like the idea of the voice of death being in the film, especially at the end.  It didn't work and brought to movie down a level.",1400371200,,318,4.431034482758621
5805503,3,B00DHJT5Q6,"The Book Thief is a watchable contribution to the already very heavily saturated life of those living in Europe while World War II happened around them genre.  For me though this was sort of like a children's film, I'm not sure it's supposed to be in fact I thought it was an adult market film, there's no blood there's not really any violence, and yet we had scenes where there should have been a lot of injuries and blood.  Also tension wise is never very high, never at any time does the viewer feel that Liesel (the main character, a young girl) is in danger of anything bad happening to her let alone death, when of course their should have been a constant feeling of fear of the consequences for her if her neighbours or the soldiers discovered her actions and those of her family.  The Liesel character is a likeable one which is always good when a film revolves mostly around one character, and played well by Sophie Nelisse.  If anything though Liesel is a little too nice, she's never gets up to anything mischief or misbehaves which is not that plausible for any kid.  I would have liked to have seen when under stress swear at someone or something like that.  Again that's why this sort of has the impression of being a Disney style kid's movie.  For much of the film Liesel and her adoptive family are supposed to be eating very little and struggling financially but they all always look well fed and well off.  Again this gives the feeling of a kids film where we want to tell the story but not make it too real.

A hint of spoilers in the next sentences if you continue to read on.  At one point the bully kid and obvious town snitch eager to pass on anything that can score him points, especially if it brings misery to others, is discovered in the vicinity of Liesel stupidly confessing to her stalker/friend that her adoptive family is hiding someone in their basement.  Now this should have made the film a lot better, at this point in the film the plot had pretty much just been treading water, and going around in circles, it wasn't going anywhere and this would have been a great direction for the film to follow, with the fear of what does he know, will he tell, should we maybe cross a moral line ourselves to prevent an innocent man and ourselves probably as well being killed?  The threat isn't really dwelled on let alone dealt with, in fact I don't remember ever seeing that bully character again.  The film also could have gone down the stalker neighbour kid angle of blackmailing the obviously not interested in him in that way Liesel, to give into his constant demands of kissing him, in return for his silence.  Then we could have seen what Liesel could come up with to outwit or get out of that situation.  But again the film simply forgets about that, with just a one line in the basement by Liesel, ""oh by the way I told whatever his name was.""

Speaking of lines, why if everyone is speaking in fluent English did the makers decide to substitute the odd word such as no for nein?  This was very noticeable and not in a good way and didn't come across as natural speaking but instead was rather comical, like an old Maxwell Smart episode or something.  Also what was the point of death's narration? The novel this is based on is famous for having the angle of telling the story through Death's eyes, but the occasional voiceover just seemed to be in the movie simply because of that and didn't really work.  In fact if you weren't familiar with the novel's hype you probably wouldn't even know it was supposed to be Death.  I actually thought it was Geoffrey Rush's voice so assumed his character was somehow either Death at the time or like many a kids' Christmas movie, he takes over the job at some point in the film and was wondering when exactly this was going to happen as the movie went on or be explained.  They should really have gone with a more distinctive, maybe deeper voice to play Death and probably given him a lot more lines if they were going to include him.

The movie was fairly predictable (obviously we know how World War II ends but beyond that).  Again more spoilers - after the bombing it was pretty obvious everyone in her adoptive family was going to be dead, probably wasn't so obvious they would just have the actor's lie there on top of rubble with a bit of dust painted on them rather than have parts of them crushed, bloodied or missing all together (hence explaining how they died). It was also obvious the cheesy scene with the stalker friend finally getting his kiss was going to happen.  Although I didn't predict the German townsfolk would cheer when the American troops rolled into town, but that's just because that was so ridiculous.  Did the makers forget this was a German and not an occupied by German soldiers somewhere else in Europe town?  You're hardly going to be cheering on the enemy who would have just killed some of your family and friends, maybe just a couple of days ago or earlier in the war, especially when they would have heard the rumours or what was happening to Germans, especially women when the allied troops took other towns before them.  Perhaps they were cheering to try and lessen the chances of this happening to them but there really needed to be a scene explaining this.  How had Liesel survived up to their arrival in the period between their arrival and her foster parents being killed as well as her shelter being destroyed?  Did she live on the streets?  Someone else take her in?  I get she would have been looked after by the man she helped nurse in the basement when he returned but that would have been quite some time down the track.  Plus a little bit creepy of him to end up in a relationship with a child who was sort of like his sister and who he would have raised during the rest of her childhood.

The Book Thief is a watchable film though, but it's no standout of the genre.  It just never seemed too real, lacked the tension a storyline like this should have had and just had the overwhelming feeling of dumbing it all down to be kid friendly.",1400284800,2,6066,4.444945848375451

When compared to the book, this is a pretty good movie, but on its own, as a film, it's beautiful.  The acting was charming and the characters felt very real and believable.  I found their treatment of translation to be very faithful to the book, and yet very effective on screen.  On the whole, I loved it.

5805580,5,B00DHJT5Q6,I loved this movie.  The girl that played the part was an excellent actress.  It was exciting to see her love for books even before she could read.  When she did learn to read and had the opportunity to read some of the books from the lady who her mother did the laundry for she was so amazed at all the books.  expecially since so many books had been burnt in a fire in the town. It touched me very much the relationship between her and the Jewish man they were hiding.,1400025600,,470,4.076086956521739

It is an amazing story and even a tough crowd or those who are not moved by some things; this is a story about how people fight to not lose their humanity (despite everything and with the very little they possess).  An inspiring story.  I will not reveal the end as it has an element of happiness and one of tragedy superbly combined in this extremely well thought about movie.  Bring your box of Kleenex if you are a lady or your wine is you will be sitting one evening to watch this. It is a good movie to end a day and make one appreciate the beauty of life.  Rush is great in his role but the little girl plays her role so exquisitely that one keeps but following what happens to her.  Superbly done from inception to completion.

It takes place when Hitler's Nazi party is moving forward against Jewish people and communists,. This is such a harsh time in our world's history and it is very difficult to watch as neighbors stand by and do nothing, as one of their friends is grabbed in the street and beaten, for being a Jew, for fear they will be punished. The intellectual and emotional growth that takes place in the main character seemed very natural and believable and I was totally drawn into her story and thoughts. I found the acting to be first rate all around, most especially Geoffrey Rush, who has been fantastic in every role I've seen him in. So while it is a difficult story,and not one for children, I do recommend it.",1399420800,,848,4.407643312101911

The story is set in Germany during WW11 and depicts the reality of how it must have been for the ordinary people of Germany.  As usual a few fanatics have to cause a lot of damage and harm to most people. The kindness and humanity of the Hubermans and Leisel was heart wrenching.

The main missing element was a more important role for the burgurmeister's wife and her library -- the way she left books on a window shelf that the ""thief"" could get on a regular basis.  You also saw little of the struggle to learn to read by the protagonist or the role that Max played in her education.  Nonetheless, this movie was a worthy effort, and Geoffrey Rush is always a joy to behold in whatever role he plays.  The young actress who played Lisle was also excellent.

5805921,4,B00DHJT5Q6,"The Book Thief (2013) was directed by Brian Percival and stars Sophie Nelisse, Goeffrey Rush and Emily Watson.

It's 1938 in Nazi Germany and young Liesel (Nelisse) encounters one tragedy after another. Her brother dies, her mother must put her up for adoption, her foster mother (Watson) is terribly cruel, and her classmates call her ""dummkopf"" because she cannot read. But Liesel's a fighter. With the help of her kindly foster father (Rush), she learns to read. A young neighbor boy (Nico Liersch) admires Liesel's spunk and the two become fast friends. But Liesel's growing love of books and reading puts her at risk in an increasingly authoritative Germany. When her family gives refuge to a Jew, Max (Ben Schnetzer), he encourages Liesel to think about becoming a writer.

The events of the war lead to catastrophe but Liesel ultimately finds redemption in her writing.

I enjoyed this tear jerker very much. The story and cast are simply superb. The only element of the film I object to is the part of the urbane Grim Reaper narrator who judges souls according to their goodness. But who is good?  God's Word says none are righteous.

""There is none righteous, not even one."" Romans 3:10
""For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."" Romans 3:23

Yes, death and judgement certainly come to us all but God's Word says those who have faith in Jesus Christ will be saved.

""For the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."" Romans 6:23
""For there is one God and one mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus."" 1 Timothy 2:5
""Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved."" Romans 10:13

The notion of a mythological grim reaper who collects souls and weighs and judges them according to the good and evil they have done is quite popular but is contrary to New Testament Christianity. Jesus came to save sinners, not the self-righteous (Luke 5:32). Just sayin'.",1398816000,,1949,4.678362573099415

didn't much care for the death voice over.

school experiences pretty standard (i.e. ubiquitous bully written/directed in a pedestrian and uninteresting way), though I liked seeing a girl capable of defending herself.

it was very nice seeing a holocaust film where ordinary german citizens tried to help those being murdered and the story believably explained why they risked their lives.

I think the film captured well the time in some girl's lives before they becomes young ladies: when some are competitive and feisty tomboys - that was fun to see and believable.

Cried alot in this film, especially in the scenes of the horrific Kristallnacht, and at the bombing deaths of her foster family and friends. music especially effecting in these sequences.

probably biggest weakness to me is not really showing who the girl is. I'm reminded of anne of green gables in that anne was of similar age, temperament and position in life to this heroine, but anne was much more clearly developed than the character here. part of the problem I think is that she just appears on the train, not enough information about her, her family or her life before she reaches her foster parents. she is a pleasant character but is always abit distant; we're not really attached to her. apparently the screenwriter didn't know he/she needed to do that. when we first met her there is the death voice over, which is not a strong attaching feature, and then she's screaming at the discovery of her little brother's death. I think the story needed a better, and different, introduction to her for us to get a sense of who she is as a person.

overall, okay story. best elements are the german couple's characterizations, though not really believable that the Frau would go to the school to inform the heroine that Max was recovering - previous characterization of the Frau didn't support her effusiveness up to that point, so screenwriter needed to fix that. acting by Emma and Jeffery was great as usual",1398816000,,2304,4.83248730964467

You love the girl in the story and the ending so touching. I would suggest reading the book before the movie as I did. Those who watched the movie before reading the book claimed they did not like the book as well, which to me is a great disservice to the book. The Book THief is an excellent read. I recommend this strongly especially if you are a book lover. As with any book or movie during this time period, there is ugliness, but not the strong graphics that are in many other books of this genre. I rarely rate a book with 5 stars, but this one well earned it in my estimation. Remember it is historical fiction and not non-fiction. This might help you to appreciate it a little more.",1398729600,2,837,4.141104294478527

5805987,5,B00DHJT5Q6,A very favorite movie of my family.  I pull this movie out whenever I have company also.  It is what I call a clean movie.  The story line holds your attention from beginning to end.  It should have won all kinds of awards.,1398729600,,223,4.116279069767442

BUT, and there usually is one, it does slow down about twice. The last few minutes are intense and dramatic, almost like it is unrelated to the rest of the movie. Tension could have been built up beforehand a little more. And, thank goodness for the ending pans as it would have been very flat otherwise. Possibly another scene of her recovery or her moving to US. It would have created a softer ending.

All-in-all, it was a really good movie. One that you will talk about with your adult children and/or grandkids after it is over.",1398643200,,654,4.360655737704918

5806023,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"The story of Leisel was poignant, entertaining, and educational. Most movies of WWII genre focus on the Jewish people and the war itself. The Book Thief brings to the screen every day life of the poorer German people and what life was like for them beginning in 1939. The actors were as superb as the story. We highly recommend The Book Thief.",1398643200,,343,4.548387096774194

5806047,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"The critics (Rotten Tomatoes, etc.) panned this movie, but my family and I loved it.  The critics apparently had a problem with the lack of gory scenes, and the fact that it humanized some Germans who lived in Nazi Germany, because it suggested that not every German agreed with Hitler.  In contrast to the critics, we watched it a few times and loved it. The characters are wonderful, the filming is beautiful (concentrate on the colors in the scenes with the Nazi flags and you will see what I mean), and it did not seem to us to downplay the Holocaust.  In fact, it is a good film with which to open a dialogue with your children about the pernicious nature of totalitarian regimes and how totalitarianism and racism can creep into any society (and the results of the Holocaust).  The acting is superb, and I have no complaints except that the film does not quite explain why the Burgermeister's wife wants to help Liesel.  Highly recommended.",1398556800,,946,4.640718562874252

5806078,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"I loved this movie. I have the book and will read it soon.
I would also like to say that I have read some cynical and emotionless movie reviews by people admittedly bored with the whole WWII Nazi ""experience"" as one called it. I consider them ignorant contrarians trying to make a fast buck by saying SOMETHING contrary, no matter how absurd and brainless. The images here remind us of something that should never be forgotten. It's a beautiful story.  I recommend this movie highly.",1398470400,,483,4.682352941176471

5806080,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"As the story opens, it is 1938, and a young German girl, whose mother cannot keep her, is sent to live with strangers.  Little Liesel adjusts to her new life with the help of her kindly new Papa who teaches her to read with the books she steals.  But life becomes frightening when the war starts and the family decides to hide a Jew in their home.

This is an exquisite movie, by far the best I've seen a long time.  The story is important and unforgettable and the cast is outstanding.  Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson are wonderful as Liesel's foster parents and Sophie Nelisse is mesmerizing as Liesel, growing from age 8 to 16.  We see the war through her eyes; she is unflinchingly brave and lovable.

There is a small amount of violence, mostly bombing, with just enough good people to show that life is worth living.  This is a tear-jerker, but well worth watching.",1398470400,,871,4.468354430379747

5806116,4,B00DHJT5Q6,"Normally when you read about the holocaust the book is sad beyond comprehension. The last thing you expect to read about is a young girl in Germany, not in the death camps. Plus you'll actually find yourself laughing occasionally, because this book is an excellent mix of sorrow and joy.

The Book Thief begins with our heroine Liesel, when she is very young clutching on to her mothers hand and her brothers as she is taken to her new Foster Family. Unfortunately Liesel is the only one to make it there, but she finds love and acceptance with her Foster father and even her foster mother. The book shows Liesel growing up where swastikas are the norm, and German soldiers are either reassuring or horrifying, but mostly a common sight. They really become horrifying though when Liesel and her new family take in Max.

After reading this wonderful review, you're probably wondering why I gave it 4 stars. I gave it four stars because at times things are very languid and take a long time to get going. Other times I had no idea what was going on.

Overall I really enjoyed this novel, and however I rated and reviewed it I hope that you read it anyway.",1398384000,2,1153,4.533653846153846

5806138,4,B00DHJT5Q6,"The movie was awesome and showed a lot of truth.  However, ""Death"" was misrepresented as death being the finality of life.  The Bible speaks of the ""Angel of Death"" but never represents death as a total ending of life itself.

5806144,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"OMG. The cast line-up (Watson & Rush) promised a good film if only the writers and director did their job- and they did. This movie is packed with moments of purity and freshness that threaten to steal the show. There are so many of them strung together.... kinda like life. If you aren't paying attention, you will miss them. This movie fabulously illustrates that.

Although it is set in Germany during the WWII era, it doesn't play like a Jewish/holocaust movie to me. It plays like a human movie. And maybe after seeing all the atrocities depicted about the holocaust, it is about time. It's beautifully done. I was fabulously entertained until the last couple of minutes. After the bombing, it just feels like a rush to wrap things up. Pity. The rest of the film is great.",1398297600,,777,4.630434782608695

I would recommend it to anyone, it has the appeal and tragedy of The Diary of Anne Frank, but with a much better outcome and a slight switching of characters. The main character, a  pretty, young, blonde-haired girl is not Jewish. Her mother though, is a Communist, and so the girl is left with a childless couple who must now raise her. These are her adventures, including hiding a young Jewish man in the basement, where she learns to love to read and steals books, or rather borrows them, from the local burgher' s home to take back to read to the young man in the basement. There is more to the story, but if I say too much I will spoil it. Only know that it is very worth seeing.",1398211200,,769,4.1610738255033555

While the book was more clear on the ugliness of human natures, especially during war, and especially among German people who watched the neighbors carted away....the movie focuses on the righteous gentiles .  In the movie, there were more of them than revealed themselves in the war.

Some of the by-standers were a bit sugar-coated, too, but if not for that, audiences would have looked away,  After all these years it is still important to tell the story of man's ( good questions  as to whether death got souls from them when they died) inhumanity to man ( death was so careful of some).

The role of books/reading is miniscule.  This is another story about a family trying their best to get through the Nazi period as positively as they can - - - a story that is much better told in other films.  This version is too smoothly rounded to truly touch your heart - it keeps putting bows on its sub-plots and handing them to the viewer.  Not my cup of tea.",1397952000,,557,4.12962962962963

I am not sure why professional film critics were so negative about it except, for, perhaps, the director's choice to not portray the atrocities under Hitler in the same brutal and graphic manner that we saw in Schlinder's List and Life is Beautiful. For me, the insinuation was still there, and when left to my imagination, it was equally brutal and disturbing. Anyone who valued the book should be able to appreciate the movie, as well.

The tenderness and gentleness of the foster father, the shrillness and yet ultimately, careful love of the foster mother, Max, the man in the cellar, and the young boy -- the true friend, all are here for our young female protagonist.

The cast, well chosen, the work beautifully done.  The insight into life in Germany during the rise of the second World War, and the common people who were caught up in it, yet some who still tried to maintain their humanity and care for the suddenly ostracized and ease the daily lives of their neighbors are well portrayed.  This is a story and a film that cause us to question the mind of Man and to examine the misguided  decisions of people who are in positions to affect the lives of their fellows -- and of those whose small gifts to their fellows are the stuff of glory.",1397865600,4,1051,4.453125

Even with the changes from the story in the book, this movie worked. I was happy that Death had a limited role (he got in the way in the book, practically ruining the story by stopping the flow and telling us what was going to happen long before that part of the story happened...turns out Death sucks at storytelling).
So, no, I wasn't a huge fan of the book. I loved the story, just not how it was told. It wasn't bad, but distracting and there was a good story there. That's why I was wanting to see the movie, hoping it would tell the story well. Okay, actually, I was hoping it would tell the story better, and I think it did.
It was basically the same story. The changes from the book didn't really take away from the bigger picture (and less Death interruption made me very happy), so I think they adapted it pretty well.

Liesel is withdrawn and wonders what happened to her biological mother.  Hans--her adoptive father--is very kind and teaches
Liesel how to read after discovering she can't read or write.  At School--Nazi era--she is befriended by Rudy, a lemon-haired
youth who wants to be Jessie Owens--the fastest man at the 1936 Olympics.  Liesel loves books and she lists words she
doesn't know on the basement blackboard.  A pogrom against Jews ensues (Kristalnacht) and a Jewish friend of Hans (the
father) seeks refuge with the family.  His name is Max and Liesel considers him family.  They celebrate Christmas by building
a snowman, and Max presents her with a diary.  What happens to Liesel's family forms the crux of the story.  The power of reading
is emphasized.  The tale is narrated by Death--brief but poignant voice overs.  It is a coming of age story beautifully acted by
Sophie Nelisse (who steals the show), Geoffrey Rush, and Emily Watson.  It is a worthy companion to the book!  5 stars.",1397779200,,1110,4.903225806451613

5806465,4,B00DHJT5Q6,"The Book thief tells the story of Liesel who is subjected to the horrors of World War II Germany and finds solace by stealing books and sharing them with others.

Not being familiar with the book, I was not familiar with the story involved here, so I wasn't exactly sure what to expect.  There are elements here that reminded me of other movies that I had seen involving WWII Germany and while it did remind me of those movies, The Book Thief was unique in its own right.

Sophie N&eacute;lisse does an excellent job as Liesel as well as all of the supporting cast, including the narrator as well, whose timely narration adds to the atmosphere of the movie.  The movie and the story does a great job at making me feel for the characters and care for them by the time the ending comes around.  Even for Mama who is a bit rough around the edges but with a big heart on the inside.

The movie is a long one at over 2 hours and 10 minutes but well worth it, by the time I got to the end, I felt a loss just like Liesel did throughout the movie.

5806614,2,B00DHJT5Q6,"Brian Percival's film of the Markus Zuzak novel contains two stand-out performances from Sophie Nelisse and Nico Liersch as the two children Liesel and Rudi.  Caught in a complex world they understand little about, they try to pursue their day-to-day lives under the most trying curcumstances.  Liesel, transplanted to a German town and billeted with a new family, has to cope with a domineering foster-mother (Emily Watson) while trying to manage at a new school where she is taunted for her inability to read.  Rudi, the perfect example of a blnd-haired Aryan, ends up rebelling against his prescribed destiny, which is to be sent away for ""special training"" in the Nazi army.  Apart from these performances, however, the film is a disappointment.  The narrative unfolds at a sluggish pace, with treacly music by John Williams lending a sentimental edge to a profoundly unsentimental story.  There is also the question of accents: one wonders why the main characters have to speak in the faux-German English accents punctuated with occasional German words ""Ja"" or ""Nein"" or ""und,"" reminiscent of the British sitcom 'ALLO 'ALLO.  This seems all the more incongruous when the script is peppered with American English neologisms.  Why the characters couldn't have spoken in their normal voices seems a mystery to me.  Thematically speaking, the film has a lot to say about the power of writing - even in a repressive regime such as Naz Germany, Liesel and her Jewish friend Max Vandenburg (Ben Schnezter) understand how important it is to read and write.  Liesel's adoptive father Hans Huberman (Geoffrey Rush) thinks much the same way - despite limited reading skills, he encourages Liesel to write all her new words on a board to compile her own dictionary.  At the end of the film Liesel emerges as a powerful figure, one who can even cheat Death (Roger Allam) in the sense that her words - and her thoughts - live on through her books.  THE BOOK THIEF has a promising idea, to be sure; it's just a pity it could not have been better executed.",1397520000,4,2045,4.895652173913043

Amazon should be careful when it uses the word ""sanitized"" when it means empty and shallow. If you can't go after a full-blown dud like this then what are you capable of criticizing? A quick note on physics. When buildings are vaporized by Aliied bombers you don't pull each of the main characters out of them with nothing more than some charcoal smudged on their cheeks and forehead. Buildings lie in ruins but the people pulled from them are obviously dead (because their eyes are closed) but their clothes are un-torn and their bodies are completely intact. Just some black smudges an the cheek and forehead from the make-up department. Unbelievable. And the little girl wandering through the Jews being walked to the concentration camp was so shallow and empty that it made me gasp in horror.

I believe this is a movie that young children could see  and get the horror of the times without over doing more than they could handle since the young girl does survive everything but did loose so much too.

5806641,4,B00DHJT5Q6,This movie gives us a different angle of the lens to view what life was like for the average German family during Hitler's reign.  A heartfelt journey during a most uncertain time.,1397433600,,180,4.625
5806642,3,B00DHJT5Q6,"This may make me sound really stupid, but it always takes me aback when I realize that the atrocities of the Holocaust and Hitlers regime took place during the 1900s.  Seeing dates that took place in the late 30s and early 40s splash onto the screen while watching this film made my stomach curl a little more because it made these events feel so recent, and in my mind they arent.  I guess that is the horror of real life, the realization that these things do happen and happen in the lifetimes of those we know, love and hold dear.  It isn't that I didn't know they took place so recently, because I did, but it isn't a reality that I acknowledge enough for it to not be shocking.

Am I making sense?

Anyways, that was the first thing that struck me about The Book Thief.  These events, while harrowing in their historical relevance, are still relevant today because they are much closer to home than we often realize.

Sadly, the second thing I noticed was not as endearing.

For me, The Book Thief works so well except for one central element that took away from and actually worked against the film in some very key areas.  I mean, did anyone else know that this movie was narrated by death?  Can anyone explain to me WHY this movie is narrated by death?  I cant be the only one who found it unnecessary and gimmicky and completely disjointed from the film, and in the films heartbreaking climax it actually became a major emotional deterrent.  I hate that it is the one element of the film I remember most.  I sticks out like such a sore thumb that it literally ruins some of the key parts of the film and lessens the impact the story would have had.

I understand wanted something to make your film standout from the rest, but usually you want that something to be somethinggood.

The story told is that of young Liesel.  In the beginning of the story we meet her on a train with her mother and sickly brother, who within seconds dies, leaving Liesel alone in the world.  The reason for this is that Liesel and her brother were on their way to being placed in foster care.  Their mother was a communist fleeing the country for her life.  Liesel winds up in the care of the Hubermanns.  Hans is a kind man, lazy and childish and endearing.  Rosa, his wife, is hardened.  She is stern and blunt and instantly looks at Liesel as a burden.  Hitlers rule is becoming very prominent, and war is eminent, and the small street that Liesel becomes a part of is drastically altered due to this fact, especially when a Jew named Max shows up on the Hubermann doorstep.

Weaving the political aspects of the story with the universal concept of childhood and the love of literature (and the ability to make a difference through your words) takes a little getting used to, especially since it doesnt all seem to gel as fluidly (or as relatively) as they would want it to.  Still, it does make an impact, and the actors do everything they can to sell this film to us.  Young Sophie Nelisse is a real find, but the film belongs to both Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson, who display such organic emotions throughout the course of the film.

I wish that the film had stripped itself of the narration altogether.  It didn't add anything to the film, and in the harrowing climax it becomes an emotional dampener, especially during a specific scene between Liesel and her friend, Rudy.

I would have loved a little more fluidity between plot points.  It does feel a little like three different films being interwoven, with little connective tissue.  Still, it has some very strong aspects (that score is sensational, and the cinematography is crisp and captivating) and the relevance of the core story is one that we should (and will) never forget.",1397433600,,3733,4.518628912071535

5806669,4,B00DHJT5Q6,"People often wonder how people-of-conscience in Germany could have allowed the Nazis to gather so much power and perpetrate the atrocities of the Holocaust.  After World War II, many decried all Germans without differentiation. This touching drama, offers insight.  Excellent acting and writing bring alive average people living under and reacting to a fascist regime. (Spoiler alert) We see Germany through the eyes of a young girl, Liesl, and the couple who takes her in to get extra rations when her mother, running from the roundups of Communists, can no longer care for her. When a young Jewish man, Max, runs to them for help, the husband takes him in, bound by honor to a promise to Max's father. Subsisting in the basement over next couple of years,  Max sees the spark of intelligence and curiosity in Liesl who thirsts for words. He encourages her to read and to write; she inspires him to live when he becomes deathly ill.

The characters feel real and balanced, making tiny rebellions and survival-based compromises to live in frightening times.  There is no villain, other than the disembodied Hitler, just people reacting for good or ill to a militarized society.  Although the story is filled with tragedy from the very beginning, this is not a story about the horrors of the camps.  It is about the effect of loss and oppression on everyday people.  More importantly, it is about how the human spirit can miraculously survive overwhelming odds.  It is a book about curiosity and creativity and how words can transform a prison and capture the emotions and colors of life.  It about the spark of goodness that can be found in unexpected places.

I recommend this highly, despite the fact that I do not like tragedies.

For those concerned about such things, there is no gore or sex. There is minimal swearing, which might not even be considered to be by some. There is death, war, and implied inhumanity to man, which are so much more offensive to me.",1397433600,9,1966,4.801186943620178

5806671,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"""The Book Thief"" somehow strikes me as a thematic  offspring of ""The Reader"" and ""The Diary of Anne Frank.""  I liked this movie a lot, even though it has many little flaws that become evident to a native German who is a contemporary of  the people depicted. Like peppering the English dialog with German expletives and calling children by abusive names. Like showing a red mailbox when that color would have been a real exception from the universal yellow for mailboxes and postal trucks. You have to suspend disbelief when a ten year old in the German school system is depicted as unable to write her own name. Or showing a book that sinks like a stone in icy water. And the child characters don't grow and mature during the seven years of the film's duration. But all that aside, the film is heartwarming in so many ways that we watched it twice thorough in the same evening.",1397433600,,877,4.537974683544304

Once we got started, however, we couldn't stop. We did notice, however, that the book thief's most common expression was no expression at all. Her young friend was fantastic. The beautiful young singers with the terrible lyrics to their songs stand out in my memory. The narration was perfect. Who was that, anyway? I would highly recommend this movie.",1397347200,,521,4.8

Also makes you realize how lucky we are in this country and in this time. I am going to make sure my children see this film.,1397347200,,292,4.178571428571429
5806721,3,B00DHJT5Q6,This is a heart-on-the-sleeve story and in being that it edits out the grittiness of the real horror of Hitler's Reich. Far too many of the scenes lacked the sense of really being there rather than watching a feel-good movie at home. For example until the last scene bombs could be heard close by but little or no damage was visible. The bedrooms were vey luxurious by WWII standards and the fake German accents with the odd words here and there auf Deutsch were too much. They should have used real German actors or not tried to make the script so over-authentic that it flopped. This was a pleasant watch but no earth-shaking drama and I doubt I will watch it again despite the cute Sophie Nlisse!,1397347200,,699,4.511811023622047

Let me say the film production of this story is excellent in every way and will neither disappoint those who read the book nor those coming to the story for the first time.  Highly recommended.

Sopie Neisse is truly a terrific actress and she was perfect in this coming-of-age story.  For a WWII era movie set in Germany, it was surprisingly less brutal than one might expect.  The story centered atound the hiding of a Jewish orphan was absolutely mesmerizing and kept our group glued.  This certainly deserved more Oscar attention than it received.  We definitely recommend this to everyone wanting a thoroughly satisfying film.",1397174400,,629,5.009615384615385

5806796,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"This is an exciting, sad, and touching story of childhood in Germany during the Second World War. I am about the same age as the children in the story but had the good fortune to be born in the United States. The story tells us of a young girl who has to leave all she has known and live with foster parents in Germany at the time Hitler was gaining control over that nation.

The young girl, Liesel Meminger, played with charming innocence by Sophie Nlisse, must adjust to her new life and the changes Hitler was bringing to Germany. The movie tells that story with great skill and immerses the viewer in a world that is both fearful and fascinating. Liesel's foster parents, Hans and Rosa Huberman, played by Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson, are doing their best to cope with all of the changes that are taking place and provide a much needed refuge for Liesel.

One of the interesting twists of the story is the off-screen narration by a voice representing death. Needless to say death is very busy at this point in history.

Other supporting parts are all convincingly played and the total impact of the movie is one that will not be easily forgotten. The overall impact for me was to again be reminded of the foolish horror of war; living in the United States, I only heard reports of what was happening long after the events had taken place.

This is a serious and stirring movie; certainly not light entertainment. It is rated PG-13 and I would advise caution in viewing it for young children. For older children and adults it is probably a movie that should not be missed. There is an important lesson there for the future.",1397174400,,1630,4.5152542372881355

All unfolding in seemingly ordinary circumstances thru the subtlety of indifference. The wardrobe colors matching parts of the background in important scenes are so stirring.

I have already watched it a few times, and each time I watch it, I notice new things about the setting, story, plot, etc. I like how the story is focused on the people and characters, rather than the horrific details of the time period. Don't get me wrong, historical events are still made obvious and clear, but the movie as a whole is one that absolutely anyone can enjoy. It focuses on the good things in life, even when times are dark and dreary. It shows us that the world is a beautiful place, and that good can be found in the most unlikely of places.

5806835,3,B00DHJT5Q6,"A touching story with compelling characters. The narration is the low part. If it had a ""disable"" button, I would have turned it off. The story and the acting did a perfectly fine job of giving these viewers enough to think about.

The narration (I won't spoil it - Though in my opinion there isn't anything worth not spoiling about the narrator's identity, I guessed it early) was cheesy and nearly ruined the movie by spoon-feeding a point-of-view.",1397088000,,450,4.769230769230769

From what I know as a man in his 60's who heard both sides of the story, the setting and story line is very very accurate.

The Movie followed the book almost perfectly.  The acting was superior and based on my personal background the representation of pre-war and post war Germany was as authentic as it gets.  Not too many people realized how the Nazi reality impacted every day Germans.  Not only that, the average German was by no means wealthy. Shortages of simple every day items like soap and cloth for clothing were common.

In addition to the atrocities committed against the Jews, ordinary German citizens could be arrested for a party affiliation (in this case communist) or have a hard time getting work and supporting their families if they were not members of the Nazi party.

I recall (back in the 70's) listening to people talk about resentments they still held against members of the Nazi party who denied them opportunities or in the case of small villages lorded their status over their neighbors.",1397088000,,1190,4.6875

5806839,4,B00DHJT5Q6,"A very good portrayal of a masterfully authored book. The value of the written word, thoughts, beliefs, values, and history was paramount in this book/movie. The Nazis burning books in attempts to curb independent thinking and learning of different beliefs and values. The Nazi hierarchy avoiding their own detection and continuing to keep massive libraries for their own reading pleasure and valuable learning. Books became an escape for the horrors of war but had to be read in seclusion and secret. The bonds of loyalty to family and friends in many instances overcame the fears of Nazi detection and persecution. Great read and good movie.",1397088000,3,643,5.133333333333334

5806850,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"FINALLY! A good, decent family movie that, I have to admit, even my husband and I loved!
It was very heartfelt, funny at times, sad at others.
The setting was the typical Holocaust time when people still hid Jewish people in their basements and such to keep them safe and hidden.

5806875,4,B00DHJT5Q6,"""I see their ugliness and their beauty and wonder how the same thing can be both?"" - Narrator / Death (Roger Allam)

The story takes place in the time surrounding the Second World War. Young Liesel (Sophie N&eacute;lisse) is removed from her commie mother and placed in a foster home. Her new foster mother appears to be cold and ruthless. Liesel must grow up and adapt to the changing social atmosphere. During this time she acquires the nasty habit of reading. However reading a secondary to what social skills she will learn, that is if she survives the war; these skills will carry her for the rest of her life.

If you are looking for something unique you will be disappointed. However for those who like challenging Junge/ M&auml;dchen facing trials and tribulations during times of adversity than this movie is for you. The story is not unique with the exception of the subplot where it gets its title. What really makes the movie are the acting, the scenery, and even the background music, by John Williams, which acts as a character itself.

I have to admit that I have not read the book yet; therefore I can tell you whether the book by Marcus Zusak is better or not, that this movie holds its own independently.

For me the book burning scene made me feel a tad like films where they kick the family dog. It is well worth the time to view.

5806876,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"After watching The Book Thief I have I really fell in love with this movie. It has such a powerful storyline. I loved seeing the other side of the story. It was based off the book The Book Thief. This was a drama, historical fiction written by Markus Zusak. The story narrated by Death, shows that life has very unexpected events. When Liesels mother is taking her to her foster parents and her brother ends up dying, it is a sad reality for that time period. This is also when The Book Thief makes her first move. Stealing the handbook of one of the gravediggers, when she makes it to her new home on Heaven Street Hans and Rosa are waiting to meet her. How she warms up to Hans you can see how they will start off having a very good relationship. Rosa on the other hand is a different story; she comes off a little crueler than Hans. As Liesel goes through the story you get to watch her grow and with the help of Hans her new papa, she becomes an avid reader. During this time in Germany there a book burnings and only teaching what they think is important to the children. After one book burning Liesel takes a book and hides it under her jacket. Papa finds out, but is not mad. They now start to read and have more words for the basement. Rosa does laundry for the mayor. The mayor finds out that Liesel like to read and lets her come over and read. All though out this book you get to see the good come out in people. It is amazing how they would risk their lives for others. When mama and papa let Max stay in the basement knowing he is a Jew, is another example. The mayors wife has to stop letting Liesel come read, she start stealing the books. She would sneak in the window and take books with Rudy. This shows her love for reading and how reading is changing her. Liesel goes through so much and this movie shows that children are resilient.

On its own, this was a terrific movie... well done. But having said that, this movie version pales by comparison to the sublime beauty and imagery found in the original book. The book, simply put, was a masterpiece.

I'd rate this movie at 4 to 4 1/2 Stars.

5807003,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"I have to start off by say I am getting a little tired of people rating movies based on the book. It is common sense to know that there is no way they can take an entire book and make the movie within a 2 hour time frame. Even if they did, we all envision things places and characters completely differently. So please, STOP reviewing movies based on the book and base your review on the actual movie, the performances and the direction.

With that said, I have to say this is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a long time! It is about a young girl who is given up by her mother during WWII to be raised by an older couple who take her in and love her as their own. During the war they take in a Jewish boy and hides him in their basement. Within the 2.5 years he lives in their basement they care for him, protect him and nurture him back to health. It also tells the story of some interesting relationships through out the entire movie that are not only fantastic but emotionally driven and moving. The performances by the chosen cast were superbly done.

I am a HUGE movie lover and currently own over 5000 titles and this one has definitely moved its way into my top 10 favorite list! A terrific story! Well written, well acted, and well directed. A must see for anyone who is moved by the strength of the human spirit.",1396656000,,1334,4.166666666666667

5807180,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"One of the most amazing films I have ever viewed. Even more amazing is the limited amount of nominations and awards it received. Although some argue that the film down plays the Nazi content in the story line, I think this subtlety was to allow the viewer to come to conclusions based on their own knowledge of that devastating time. What sets this film apart from others of the genre is that it implies by means of strong dialog and costume(Nazi Youth Uniforms) rather than depict visually, once again, the horrors of the ghettos and concentration camps. All in all, this is one to add to the book and film library.",1396396800,,616,4.558558558558558

It depicts the trampeling of Germany's unarmed citizens by a the Nazi dictator from burning books to structuring schools to teach German children the evils of freedom of speach.  The Book Theif disobeys the laws of Nazi Germany and wins the hearts of those around her in the process.,1396310400,,410,4.680555555555555

I'm really glad I did because this was such a wonderful and heartwarming film! It really touched my soul with the way it portrayed powerful emotions through one very courageous little girl during the time of Hitler. I especially want to read the book, which some people felt was a whole lot better than the actual film, but everyone says that about nearly every great story that's adapted to film. You can't have everything in 2 hours! But truly, I loved this film and if you're into watching something of substance one fine evening, please give this a chance. Don't forget the tissues!

5807245,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"This film is really two great movies in one!  First off, you have Geoffrey Rush, (the guy that did such a wonderful job portraying ""Wasingham"" in the ""Elizabeth"" movies, & the lead role in the ""King's Speech"") doing another superb character in this touching, compassionate, and revealing story of a European family during the 1930's/40's. If you like shows that have adolescent issues, adoption scenarios, or warm family situations, then this is a show you will want to own for repeated viewings.

But this film also happens to be set with the world of Nazi-dominated Germany with all it's associated trappings.  It is not necessary to know everything about the period to enjoy this wonderful movie because the script is marvelously written, and has great narration to keep a non-history oriented viewer interested.  But for folks like me, that are well-read on the period, it is just flat-out GREAT!  I loved seeing the truth brought out this way.  This stuff really happened the way the Director plotted it out.

Truth is, the girl in the lead role steals the show.  Sophie Nelisse is her name I think.  She is as talented as Elizabeth Taylor was.  Each facial expression, every moment she makes is just perfect as she ""ages"" in this tale that replicates the lives of so many good people that were caught in this maelstrom of evil that was the third Reich.  I had never heard of her before, but she must have done a lot of acting somewhere to be this good!

The ""Mother"" role is that charming lady that played Rocky's new love interest in ""Rocky Balboa"", which I also liked much.  It is amazing how Emily Watson is able to alter the nature of her role in this show from a tough survivor true to the Germanic culture of the time, and yet be so very warm and likeable as she was in that good Stallone movie.

I will watch this multiple times I am sure.  The music of the movie is as good as the sound track of ""Dr. Zhivago."" It just takes you back to this period of time when the world was so different than it is now, (well everywhere except in the Ukraine nation where history seems to be repeating itself currently.)

This show has that ""magical"" feel about it, kinda like ""Gravity"" does by making the viewer feel that he is actually there with the actors.  Yet, it is not stark, or one dimensional ever.  There are no battle scenes, blood & gore that might disturb young viewers, even though the subject matter would seem to pose this issue.

""The Book Thief"" is really a family drama that would be enjoyed by anyone!",1396224000,2,2521,4.537610619469026

5807279,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"The story of 'The Book Thief' begins on a train, steaming its way through the snow laden countryside, just after an eye-opening monologue from the narrator, 'Death' (voice of Roger Allam). He so carefully reminds us that we are all going to die then proceeds to take young Liesel's (Sophie Nelisse) brother away.  Her mother sits crying while holding his lifeless form until the train makes a stop to bury the boy alongside the tracks. After her brother passes on, Liesel takes a book that fell from him at the burial site. This will be the first of many that Liesel will take, borrow, steal, and do just about anything for.  Due to the unknown reason that her mother cannot take care of her any longer, and her brother is now gone, Liesel is all alone. She does safely arrive at the home of her new parents, Hans (Geoffrey Rush) and Rosa (Emily Watson) Hubermann, during the winter of 1938. The director (Brian Percival) weaves a multilayered, character driven, tapestry of loss, life, and love in Germany during wartime.  It is easy to see in several places how this tale is told through the child's eyes.  Add to this wide-eyed precious daughter, a gentle and loving father who is devoted to her, and there is a richer depth which is all the more unique for the telling.

Hans is immediately smitten with his new daughter upon her arrival, calling her ""Your Majesty"" to coax her out of the car and later adding ""Princess"" to her pet names.  Rosa, being the stricter of the couple, sets the rules quickly on how they are to be addressed; Mama and Papa, to use proper manners, and how long she can be running around playing with her friend Rudy Steiner (Nico Liersch). Some crucial stable, however never smooth, time goes by as the small family settles in.  Some extremely harrowing situations take their turn at bat too.  Liesel wears a uniform like all of the other children, including the swastikas.  They look almost like a military youth brigade as they stand and sing Germany's song in Germanic, with the words on the bottom of the screen for the full effect.  I had neither heard nor read those lyrics before viewing the film; they sickened me as much as the hanging swastikas plastered on flags that they were in front of.  Then the family had to attend a book-burning type of gathering, the sight of this alone was horrific.

Once again, the book thief struck, and Liesel gains another work for her interesting collection from this cruel conjuncture.  She saves a smoldering textbook left from the fire while Max (Ben Schnetzer), a young Jewish family friend, moves into the Hubermann's basement from his hiding place.  Liesel and Max have wonderful conversations about what their individual lives have been like.  Max teaches Liesel that her words mean everything, and they can take her anywhere while things just get worse surrounding everyone.  This family has to try to make anything pleasing or there would be nothing whatsoever left.  They spent one particular Christmas making it completely special, being cheerful and happy.  They all try to make something out of very little.  When they can get Rosa involved, well, I guess they are really doing well.  Like Liesel says about her mother, ""She is like a thunderstorm because she rumbles all of the time"".

There are several times Death makes comments about what is happening, or what he is doing in the story at that point. I thought the way they represented him in this film was extremely original.  He doesn't take on a necessarily ominous tone or otherworldly countenance, only a talking presence while his words can teach at the same time.  He speaks his own truths and is another character in the movie, not fully fleshed out although. I thought for Death to be out in his full invisible form, nondimensional, and with a personality was brilliant in the script. I certainly found this movie's heart was in its relationships, one character to another.  Hans explaining to Liesel that he has trouble reading too therefore they could learn together.  A point where Rosa and Hans' accordion were inseparable. ""The Book Thief"" is scored beautifully (John Williams).  It swells and fills in any spaces that need something lovely.  The cinematography (Florian Ballhaus) is breathtaking; The opening scene with the train going a crossed a snow mantled countryside is a beautiful example of the photography.  An all around wonderful movie that takes you through every emotion and leaves without a dry eye in the house.",1396137600,3,4482,4.808344198174707

Welcome to this glimpse of life in World War II Germany, seen through the eyes of a young girl, whose story unfolds, one chapter following another, each punctuated with the stealing, (or borrowing, as Liesel calls it), of a book.  Wonderful cast, superb story-telling, and good cinematography.  Precocious Canadian actress Sophie Nelisse, lovely, articulate and destined to become an acting icon, paired with Emily Watson, a polished, proven veteran of British cinema, I loved it, from beginning to end, as death, the narrator, hovering ever in the background of the living, winds up haunted by the soul of the beautiful Liesel, in the end.",1395878400,,714,4.983193277310924

5807444,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"This movie was close to cinematic perfection. John Williams composed the amazing film score, and the cast was composed of some of the finest actors out there.  As for the story itself, it left you breathless. Liesel is the main character in the story, and she embodies strength and innocence. Faced with WW2 and helping her family hide a Jewish man in their basement, she manages to survive and also frequently escapes from reality through the world of books. Max, her Jewish friend who is in hiding, inspires her to write herself. He says, ""If your eyes could speak, what would they say?""

Liesel's best friend is a boy named Rudy. He is always asking for a little innocent kiss, and always Liesel refuses. She will finally give him a kiss . . . yet the circumstances surrounding that one kiss will leave an impression on you that is hard to shake.

I'll not give any more details of the story away, yet I will suggest people watch this movie themselves. It has an important message and is truly a masterpiece. I gave it five stars because it truly is the best film I've seen in a long time.

The narrator is death, and he is interpreting the story of Liesl, a girl who has lost her mother during the Nazi takeover of Europe.  She is taken in by an older couple and grows close to the sympathetic father, wonderfully played by Geoffrey Rush.  They teach each other how to read, and then fight to protect Max, the Jewish friend they hide.  Liesl's friend Rudy is endearing, always trying to steal a kiss.  As the Nazis threaten their family's happiness, they strengthen each other to overcome.  In the end, Liesl is the sole survivor of a bomb that takes the lives of her parents and Rudy.  As Death takes them all, he is mystified by human existence.  Perhaps because of this, it never comes a satisfying end, to give meaning to their story.  Good acting with nowhere to go.",1395792000,2,880,4.518987341772152

Sophie Nelisse plays a magnificent role as Liesel, a beautiful once-illiterate young woman under Nazi rule during World War II.  A poignant story of hardship, separation from her mother, losing her sibling to death, being shipped off to foster parents, adolescence, psychological trauma, love, companionship and survival, this courageous young woman's struggle to make the best of a horrendous Nazi regime through reading and her love for books is outstanding and memorable.

Just seeing the culture, the mindset then, the reaction to how her father thought & felt when he defend a Jewish man, CRAZY! I liked both the book & the movie they were just both different but the same.",1395705600,,388,4.402777777777778
5807547,5,B00DHJT5Q6,This movie followed the book fairly closely.  I thought the acting was well done.  This movie (and the book) do a wonderful job of creating the atmosphere of a horrible time.,1395705600,,174,4.580645161290323

I really cannot say enough about this movie, from Liesel, to her stepmother and stepfather, to the little blond boy whose name I cannot recall at this moment.

I originally had a problem reading the book (being old rather than the age it whom it was written).  But after some of my book club members explained it a bit, I found it an excellent story.

Many of us wondered how it would be brought to the screen or if it could possibly be as absorbing.  It was.  The casting was inspired and the film was excellent.",1395705600,,479,4.208791208791209

5807614,2,B00DHJT5Q6,"I unfortunately found this film to be a bit too slow and unfocused in its presentation. I kept hoping to see a more touching and deeper presentation of these characters relationships, but the film barely chips at the surface of what it needs to build a stronger emotional connection to the story. Had the film been better the ending should have been strongly cathartic, but it instead feels abrupt and lackluster. The acting is really quite exceptional, but it not supported by direction nor cinematography. The film presents a monotone quality in almost every facet. The colors of the film are an incessant blue/gray tone that never blooms to any brightness even in the happier moments. The music is forgetable. The storytelling is droll. It is terrible that this story got a by the books film with no imagination at all.",1395705600,,822,4.836879432624113

This is also the day of her first book theft. The characters are very well developed and seen both from the perspective of the Book Thief, whose life is interwoven with all of them, and Death, who will one day meet all of them, There are also books within the book, since the Book Thief steals more books and reads them, and eventually writes one of her own.

5807637,4,B00DHJT5Q6,"An excellant rendering of a moving story.  But be prepared for more tears than cheers.  After all, it is a story taking place in Nazi Germany, a time and place of more hate than love, and is narrated by ""Death.""",1395705600,,211,4.25

5807689,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"I was moved by the kindness of some of the characters.  Actually, I was surprised to see how poorly some of the Germans of the time lived.  The movie was extremely well-acted, and the story was highly entertaining.  The only things with which I could find fault were that I felt that the foster mother, played by Emily Watson, changed over time, but there were no particular incidents shown to have changed her, and I felt that it was extremely unrealistic that a building could take a direct hit but that practically untouched whole bodies could be laid out in the street, afterwards.",1395705600,,585,4.660194174757281
5807690,4,B00DHJT5Q6,I liked this movie very much but I suspect that it didn't include important parts that are in the book.  I will have to read it now (good idea to do that first).  The acting was very good and there was enough development of the main characters to be able to care about them.  I am wondering what happening after the end of the movie??  I suppose that is just to leave to our imaginations.,1395705600,,388,4.133333333333334

They do edit the book but leave in all you need to enjoy this movie.  The kid actors are fantastic as is everyone else.  Great cast.  If you haven't read the book, you won't miss what you didn't see, but this is one that after viewing, go read the book because as always, it's even better.  Can't say enough good about this movie.

5807723,5,B00DHJT5Q6,My daughter and I were so anxious to see this movie as we had both read the book recently. This movie does not disappoint.

5807727,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"As normal with most movie adaptations from books, there were many aspects of the story that were left out.  I felt those parts really made the connections that in this story were so important.  Like the connection with Death.  The fact that the story was told from his point of view was interesting.
The fact that Rudy said, she would want to kiss him one day.  That he tried several times during in the book to get a kiss from her, but always failed.  That fact that it was his failures that endeared him to her more than his success.  That was why the kiss in the end was so touching.
The connection between her new father, and the Jewish man, knowing the dangers, why didn't her mother not object?  How could a man put his family at risk like that.  If you knew the history, it would be understood.  What was it that made the Jewish man and her connect on so many levels.
In the book, when death finally went to retrieve her, he gave her the book that she was writing in the basement, which was why she survived the bombing and her parents didnt. She had lost the book when they rescued her, but death found it, and kept it.
The book was fantastic, the movie was very good.",1395705600,,1176,4.237668161434978

This movie centers around the humanity of one family and their daughter in Nazi Germany who take in and hide a man who is a Jew. The daughter learns to read through a book she found and a book she rescued from a fire. These books are her connection and interaction which bind her to her father and the Jewish man they are hiding. She reads aloud to her father and the Jewish man stories which keep the man alive.

5807895,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"What a great movie!  Takes place during WWII showing briefly the indoctrination of the children, and Hitler's reason for burning books.  She considered herself a book ""borrower"", not a thief! The acting was so good too.  I really enjoyed the movie and I think everyone should watch it partially because of the historical content.",1395532800,,329,5.055555555555555
5807896,3,B00DHJT5Q6,"Like many books turned to movies, this one was well acted with a well matched storyline.  But with the most translations, no matter how good, a best seller is a hard act to follow.",1395532800,,180,4.294117647058823
5807897,3,B00DHJT5Q6,"I don't really see this as a ""coming of age"" story like other reviewers have said. The story isn't even based upon that, but living a life when WW2 started and trying to survive.  The effects, cinematography and acting is great. But it was a very slow moving movie with really um, no plot? It didn't have much ""substance."" I give this movie 2 1/2 stars actually. I have not read the book. I probably would not recommend this movie, and I like movies that take place during WW2 (just not the real intense stuff as they are very hard to handle.)",1395532800,2,543,4.323529411764706

5807934,4,B00DHJT5Q6,"The story was an intense study of the human spirit when under the thumb of adversity.  The young girl's performance was memorable.  I liked how her relationship with her foster family developed.  Even under the best of circumstances the journey from adolescence to adulthood can be daunting, but most of us don't do it in the midst of genocide orchestrated by a madman.  Watch this film, but don't plan on enjoying it; plan on learning something from it.  Plan on being inspired.  I would have given it five stars had it not been filmed so dark and had the story not moved along so slowly.  The only way we will ever stop the Hitler's of the world is to watch, listen and learn.

5807975,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"I've read the book and was a little hesitant to see the movie. You know how movies tend to slaughter the book's version. Anyway, I was really surprised by how closely the movie followed the true story! I loved it! Yes, there are some characters and scenes that had to be left out to condense it to less than a 2 hour movie, but it didn't water down the story.",1395446400,,359,4.142857142857143

It is taken from a true story and really worth the purchase price.  This one you will want to keep and watch again and again.  I don't know about you, but my feel is the academy really misses the boat some years and this was one of them.  Just an FYI, keep the tissue box close.",1395360000,,426,4.072289156626506

I was anxious to see the movie but as with any beloved book that goes to film, worried that it would not live up to my expectations. The movie did not disappoint. The actors chosen to play the main characters were excellent and the plot followed the book well.  The book's richness in its use of colors and symbolism was not present in the movie but the narrator played  by 'Death' did play a part. Overall, well done.",1395360000,,479,4.252747252747253

5808077,4,B00DHJT5Q6,"I read the book first as I usually do if I can. It always gives the movie so much more meaning because it provides so much more detail than a 2-hour film allows. This is certainly the case for this story and it will be one that I will never forget. I especially loved the creative use of narrating. It definitely should be required reading for young adults.  Cast chosen for the film was ""Spot-On!"" I was very pleased with the actors' portrayals of these memorable characters.

Possibly owing to the effervescence of the characters and the nicely done scenic profile of small town life in Germany  preceding and during World War II.  The political aspects are quite prominent along with some fantastical fairy tale episodes and adolescent romantic overlays.  Yet, my overall rating of 3 Stars stems from the basic familiarity of the storyline whereby general predictability far outweighs any pretense of genuine drama and suspense.",1395273600,,617,5.26530612244898

The foster parents are a mystery at the beginning.  The foster mother seems stern and the father is so lovable that you are taken in by his kindness.  Now that I think of it, it was around 1933 that Hitler became leader of Germany when the first book burnings takes place.  She steals one of the partially burnt books when she thinks no one is watching and so begins the story.  Watch and you will fall in love with her.",1395273600,,731,4.171428571428572

It is frightening to see how people can follow a ruthless and misguided leader, causing the tragic destruction of lives and property.

I was looking forward to seeing how they converted the almost six hundred page book into a movie. Superbly done. I'd give Liesel, Rose, Hans and Rudi each an Oscar, if It were within my ability. People who haven't read the book might be confused initially by the narrator, not realizing it is ""death"". And Saumensch und Saukerl might need a translation, but oh, so necessary to the story. The few German words don't get in the way and are easy to comprehend from context. Do watch! It will make you cry, even though it is an uplifting story.",1395187200,,691,4.536

5808117,5,B00DHJT5Q6,Absolutely wonderful. Emotional.  Beautifully written. What an amazing young actress. The whole cast was amazing.  I recommend it highly but be sure to have tissue handy. It's emotionally draining and a tear-jerker.,1395187200,,215,5.6875
5808118,4,B00DHJT5Q6,"The movie takes place in Nazi Germany, and is narrated by Death, during a time that he states he is very busy. It is about a girl named Leisel and her life with her foster parents, her neighbors, the Mayor's wife and with a young adult Jewish male named Max, who is being hidden in her Foster parent's basement.
Leisel's birth mother gives up her two children in hopes for a better life for them, although the movie hints that her mother is a Communist. On the way to their foster parent's Leisel's brother dies and this is when Death becomes acquainted with the girl. At her brother's funeral, Leisel sees a book on the ground, "" The Gravedigger's Handbook,"" and she takes it. That is when Death calls her the Book Thief. Her foster father teaches her to read from that book and Leisel is hooked on books and ""borrows"" books from the Mayor's house. Books are the source of nourishment for this young girl, during very trying times.
Without giving away the entire story, I found the movie to be very close to the book and that is was captivating. The acting was wonderful and it is a good story.",1395187200,2,1095,4.425742574257426
5808119,4,B00DHJT5Q6,"Somewhat tricky storyline (some gaps in understanding beginning of story) but very good overall portrayal by Emily Watson of the ""book thief"" character and interactions with her new family and neighbors during World War II  in Germany.",1395187200,,235,5.351351351351352
5808120,5,B00DHJT5Q6,This is a book about the Holocaust. There are very sad events throughout the book. But I did not find it a sad book. I found it an inspiring book about love!,1395187200,,157,3.9375
5808121,5,B00DHJT5Q6,Loved it. Not over the top visuals. Perfect story and performances. Will definitely watch it again. Great learning experience for family.,1395187200,,137,5.571428571428571
5808122,3,B00DHJT5Q6,"I'm a history buff so I eagerly anticipated THE BOOK THIEF knowing it was set in WWII Germany. There have been countless movies set in this period telling the countless story of a terrible time. We see life during war through the eyes of a young German girl. It seemed like there was a chance to tell a different story but all the potential is lost in a rather listless story.
First, the good points of this film that make the film worth watching. There is a phenomenal cast headed by a lovely and talented young actress Sophie Nelisse. Her large inquisitive eyes tell a story in themselves. She shines in the film and watching her is the true gem of this film. Starring as her adoptive parents are Emily Watson and Geoffrey Rush--two fine actors who we just don't see enough of on film. Also, the authentic setting and clothing add a realistic tone to this period piece. We seem to be off to a good start..well, if only...
Young Liesel and her brother are being taken on a train trip by their mother. We soon learn the pair are being taken for adoption but tragedy strikes will on the train. It's never really clear why the mother is giving up her beloved children other than a vague reference to her being a communist. Was she about to be arrested by the Gestapo or was she trying to escape? We never know.
Liesel is adopted by a kindly Hans (Geoffrey Rush) and his bitter shrew of a wife Rosa (Emily Watson). Again, it's not clear why a poor and struggling middle-aged couple adopt Liesel. Rosa's bitterness is never explained nor do we know why the couple is childless--was it by choice or did they lose a child or more through the eyes.
Some background would help us better understand and relate to the characters.

From here the movie drags on and Liesel tries to adapt to her new life and the attentions of her neighbor Rudy. We learn that Liesel's obsession with books is clouded by the fact that she cannot read. And she is not really a book thief but rather someon who finds lost books and later ""borrows"" books she returns, so why is she the ""book thief?"". Enter Max, the young Jewish man that Hans and Rose hide and you have a rather typical WWII film but without the details.

The story meanders and we only get glimpses of the hardship of German citizens in World War II. The scenes of Jewish people being dragged away are minimal so we really have a story of people who are struggling but maybe not suffering all that much--until the allied bombing begins.

As an odd story plot, death narrates the film. For the longest time, I thought it was HANS telling the story but towards the end of the film, it is clear Death comes calling as he tells the story. The Death character voiceover seemed like a disappointing way to tie up the film and provide an ending. It also takes away from the authenticity of the story. Yes, it is war and we know people will die.

I wanted so much more from this story yet I felt cheated. Sophie Nelisse is the reason to watch this film. No doubt we will be seeing more and more of this fine young actress. Don't expect too much from the film. Enjoy Sophie Nelisse, Geoffrey Rush, Emily Watson and the period setting and you might not be too disappointed.",1395187200,,3198,4.406091370558376

5808161,4,B00DHJT5Q6,"A fantastic film. It's not an all time great, but it is solid and will move you. It is sad (not surprising given the subject matter) so keep that in mind. My only problem was the use of German with English. I'd rather they just used one.

Other than that, you can't go wrong with this one.",1395187200,,289,4.0701754385964914

5808165,4,B00DHJT5Q6,The whole cast did a great job.  The movie brought you into the lives of the German people during the II World War in a way that I had not looked at it before.  Are we as a nation setting back and letting somthing similar happen here in the USA?,1395187200,,245,3.88

5808180,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"This excellent film takes a look at war from the point of view of civilians trapped by circumstance.

War stories are often about the generals or the grunts--either those directing the actio or those carrying out the orders..  The Book Thief focuses on those who  stay at home and suffer collateral damage in war, particularly the scourge and rise of Nazism before and during World War 2. You live through the characters and experience how the indifference and fear and resignation and compliance and resistance and random acts of heroism play out in a village of working class Germans--the consumers and victims of the war.

A t the center is the book thief Liesl and her foater family. They wish to remain immune from the travails of war but are drawn in by harboring an orphaned Jewish boy. This act of heroism and compassion puts them in danger  Counterpoint to the war theme is the power of words and story to sustain and uplift the human spirit.

Thie film is gracefully told and beautifully filmed with excellent acting. I would recommend it for ages 13 and above.  It raises many questions that invite questions about good and evil.",1395187200,,1140,4.7272727272727275

5808185,4,B00DHJT5Q6,"I really enjoyed reading the book, and looked forward to seeing the movie.  I don't know that the movie captured the depth of the emotions of the characters, the grittiness of the setting, or the danger of the time period that was conveyed by the book.

5808213,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"The movie gives a good feel for Germany's inexplicable malevolence toward Jews in the years preceding World War II, but it's a really a story about home and family.

I would recommend this book for families with children over 7yrs old because there is some very intense scenes.

5808243,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"Had I followed the reviews at Rotten Tomatoes I probably would not have watched this movie.  There are no valiant battle scenes or gruesome SS interrogations.  It is a story of a young girl who is growing up while the world is self-destructing around her.  She sees the best and the worst of the people around her and finds a path allows her to cope with her surroundings.  The cast is great and mostly unknown to me.  How nice to see a movie with good acting and without the same old Hollywood hacks that show up in almost every other movie.  If you have read the book you will still like the movie but as expected, there are some differences and the viewer might have to use imagination to bridge a couple gaps in the sequences.

5808342,2,B00DHJT5Q6,"If you have read the book which is fabulously written you can only shake your head at this cinematic interpretation.

So many details that made you care about the characters and drew you into the story line are omitted that you never really feel connected.  Its like watching an Lifetime movie.
The absence of these nuances give you a completely different perspective on the main characters and their motivation.

Death, whose opinions are an integral part of the novel with such a dry humor, nonchalant attitude about his ""profession"" , and matter of fact sense of normalcy regarding the tragedies of life has merely a supoporting role here.  It is a pity because his narration, his ability to see ""into"" the story gives the story its edge.

You never get a sense of the moral challenges faced  by Liselle, Max, or Hans Hubermann, etc. that make their decisions, good and/or bad, poignant and thought provoking.  Their thoughts and actions, whitewashed by the movie or omitted altogether leave you feeling as though there was something missing - and it is - the intimate details of theitr humanity which adds weight and credibility to the story.

If you have not read the book this movie is passable.
If you loved the book you will be sorely disappointed.",1395014400,,1256,4.809302325581395

5808378,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"A fuller review will come, let me simply say The Book Thief is one of the better movies I've seen. PLEASE - watch this for yourself - don't let the critics guide in missing a great film. It is a lyrical presentation of a time at war from a girl's view who does not understand everything but simply lives the life she is given. While the book is somewhat darker, it is presented in almost fantasy form from the inside of German - not from the outside with all of history to help shape your view.

This move is beautifully done, faithful to the book (while there are differences) and contains the passion and care that so many reviewers find missing. Honestly, it is movement like these when I wonder if I am an alien or simply cannot see what they see. We saw two different movies: theirs was bland with saccharine on top; Mine was stunning and poignantly moving.

I have seen all the other movies that were nominated for an academy award, and why this did not win (not sure it was even nominated) is beyond me.

Add the substantially excellent acting and you have a film quite worthy of an oscar nomination.  I would make it required viewing for a history or literary class studying this period.  In reading the novel, I was at first a little put off at the narration by personified Death entity, but as I got into the novel it became to me an excellent balancing of feeling and pace, and one in which the movie narration faithfully followed (show in much shorter form).

So often the movie version of a good book is chopped up and disappointing; not so in this case. I felt the characters, in this story were well represented by all the actors. Some parts of the movie made me laugh, chuckle or smile, and other parts I watched with watery eyes but the ending made me smile and feel good for Liesel. Yes I admit to being an emotional if not romantic kind of guy. There were a few lines from the book that should have been in the movie such as when Rudy fantasized being a black Jesse Owens and his father was cleaning him up and explaining why this was not a good thing to do and said ""...you have blonde hair and safe blue eyes..."".  I think the voice of Death would have had a word or two about the line Jews being marched through the street and the scene from the book with Liesel and Max there in the street. The book was historically accurate and I thought the movie was too, and true to the people in the story who were caught up in these events. Unfortunately not everything that happened in the book can be included in the movie without going to three or four hours but even with those omissions this movie was great. I would recommend it to everyone. I would recommend reading the book too.  I will no doubt watch a second time later on.",1394928000,,1417,4.186813186813187

It failed. But here it is now in DVD format and in many ways this may be the best way to absorb this compelling story.

THE BOOK THIEF, based on the beloved bestselling World War II-era novel by Markus Zusak and adapted for the screen by Michael Petroni, tells the story of Liesel Meminger (Sophie Nlisse),a spirited and courageous young girl who transforms the lives of everyone around her when she is sent to live with a foster family, Hans Hubermann (Geoffrey Rush) and his caustic wife Rosa (Emily Watson) in World War II Germany. Her brother has died and her mother is selling Liesel for cash. She arrives having just stolen her first book, ""The Gravediggers Handbook"" - it will be the beginning of a love affair with books. Her new Papa teaches her to read and bestows love and affection while Mama remains businesslike and cold. Liesel's only friend is Rudy (Nico Liersch), a spicy little neighbor boy with whom she becomes close. The Hubermann's agree to hide a young Jewish lad Max Vandenburg (Ben Schnetzer), the son of a close family friend, who is ill. The Hubermanns and Liesel nurse him back to health but as the war progresses Max must leave to prevent the Hubermanns from being discovered as harboring a Jew. Papa is conscripted but returns and eventually the village is bombed at the peak of the war. How Liesel deals with all of these changes makes for a fascinating, emotionally gripping story.

The aspects of the film are so beautifully wrought - acting, cinematography (Florian Ballhaus), musical score (John Williams), screenplay, story - that this is a film that likely will become part of movie lovers' libraries. The fact that it is narrated by Death (Roger Allam) may have put off many people in the theater. At home, it is simply another haunting element Highly Recommended.

I can't imagine this movie wasn't the winner of several awards.

5808652,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"Geoffrey Rush gives heart to yet another movie, a period piece set in Nazi Germany.  It's a different look, a view from the Germans who had to be Nazi because they'd die if they went against their government.  Reminds us that we are lucky (some countries) to be able to have the freedom to say what we wish, do what we wish, live how we like.  The Book Thief captures the essence of several different personality types, all of which are portrayed by actors in an amazing, heartwarming, captivating way.  You discover the beauty of love from unlikely places.  Childhood love and childhood decisions... there are parts that made tears come down.  I loved this movie and I'm glad I have it in my collection to watch.  Everything was well done about this movie.

5808671,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"First, let me say that I haven't read the book . . . yet. I plan to, but this opinion is based entirely on the movie. Sure, there are a lot of movies about wars and Germany and persecution, but that's now what captivated me or drew me into the magic of the story. It was the people, the characters. Sophie Nelisse was superb, Nico Liersch, who played Rudy, was even more superb. Put them together and they were unstoppable. Love, both sweet and deep, heartache, joy, and so much more. I cannot think of one thing I disliked about this movie, and I'm picky (more reader than movie watcher). Even the ending was perfect (despite an event which left me in tears but I won't spoil it). I don't know that I would say this is a family movie as it might be difficult for children to follow, but I think that's unfortunate because there is a lesson to be learned even by children. Don't watch it because it's a war movie or because of history and you're looking for absolute authenticity. I'm sure the purists could find plenty wrong with the story or narration, but give it a chance. Watch it because you want to feel everything they feel, and see things they way they do. The actors and director should be extremely pleased with what they've done. Highly recommended and, well . . . seriously, a stunning movie from start to finish.",1394668800,,1326,4.416326530612245

Second, I do watch a lot of movies and have well over 5000 DvD's in my collection.
So I will not write my review comparing this to the book. I could not do that since I have not read it.
My wife was a bit disappointed that they left quite a few characters  out. As well as she said they change the dynamics a bit.
Well so much for that.
My point as a movie goer is this is a great film. The acting was great as well as the filming.
It is a great story of the time period.
Now here is as a movie goer it starts to flatten out a bit.
One,  there has been so many great movies similar to this made. Let me name a few that equal this and at times rival it.
The first one that comes to mind is Life is beautiful this is a Italian film that won many awards this film is what this could have been but it was not.
The next choice for me is The boy in the striped pajamas another great film of this sad time in history.
Lets not forget Shindlers list or The pianist.
To me as a MOVIE GOER no a reader the above mentioned films are just as good and on the same level as The book thief.
So can I say there is nothing new here? Yes there is nothing new here. But if you have 2 hours to kill and want to watch a great film watch it. But the go and see the four other films I mentioned above.

In The Book Thief I believe the same outcome will transpire though the story does present a near happy ever after ending.

5808945,2,B00DHJT5Q6,"There is a moving, beautifully-filmed story about a handsome young German girl struggling for her life, and to come of age, through an unlikely bond with a young Jewish refugee during the death throes of the Third Reich. This isn't it.

That film is Cate Shortlands remarkable Lore (2012), and if you haven't seen it, you should.

About this film, which also concerns an orphaned German girl coming of age through a relationship with a young Jewish refugee in the dying days of the Reich, Im not so sure. Director Brian Percival  he of Downton Abbey  paints by numbers, and his scriptwriter Michael Petroni has a tin ear for dialogue.

The opening aerial shot, swooping in over a layer of cloud, is trite enough to be a studio logo animation. As we dive through the cloud to track a steam train puffing excitedly through snow-bound countryside, one could be forgiven for deducing a Harry Potter instalment. But no: Roger Allams mellifluous baritone fills the soundstage and we are underway. Allam is the unseen voice of Death, and he intercedes periodically through the two and a quarter hours of this film to tell slow witted viewers what is going on.

Yet Allams dialogue is aspirationally coherent and not actually meaningful. If you let his velvet gravel, John Williams lachrymose music and Florian Ballhaus luscious images do their work, you may switch off altogether and still get the gist.

The gist comes through loud and clear elsewhere: 10 year-old Liesl, (Sophie N&eacute;lisse) has been orphaned and comes to live with Hans (Geoffrey Rush) and Rosa (Emily Watson), of whom Hans is warm and kind, and Rosa cold, practical, and interested only in the money she will earn from fostering. They wind up sheltering handsome young Jewish refugee Max (Ben Schnetzer), and everything else proceeds exactly as you would expect had you any experience with this sort of story (The Diary of Anne Frank, Schindlers List, and so on), only without any edge or challenge to expectations. Petronis awful dialogue affords the cast no scope to practice their craft and the viewer no need to practice inference. Instead, through wholly artificial dialogue delivered in cod German accents, which lapse for easy words into actual German (nein, ich bin nacht kidding) the screenplay beats us over the head with every plot development.

The actors, accordingly, flounder. Rush is as good a character actor as youll find these days, and he works a small miracle breathing life into Hans. Watson singularly fails to animate Rosa, and with their tender years the two child leads, N&eacute;lisse, and Rudi (the exceedingly Aryan-looking Nico Liersch) have no chance. N&eacute;lisse is an engaging personality, and may go far, but at 11 she was a few years young for this to generate the sort of vertiginous pubescent tension of Lore: Hannelore (15, but played by 18 year-old Saskia Rosendahl) is truculent, nuanced, vulnerable and organic. Liesl is (by necessity) wide-eyed and saccharine, though she does give one of her classmates a good kicking early on.

(Contains spoilers)

Thereafter the screenplay pulls punches it should have thrown heartily: despite being threatened, Liesls basement secret is never discovered. Nor is her book-thievery. Max is not captured. Despite being selected and threatening to run away, Rudy never gets sent to military training, and while Hans does get conscripted, before long hes home again nursing nothing more than a limp and percussion deafness in one ear. A book burning is portrayed rather like a glum Guy Fawkes night. Even Kristallnacht is sanitised. Max reaches deaths door from fever a couple of times but, after some mawkish scenes, is turned away each time.

(End of spoilers).

Thus the long middle of the film stumbles around like a blind man in a dark room who keeps walking into cupboards. Eventually he finds his way out, courtesy of a ten-ton weight unprompted by any of the dramatic devices or character arcs that have been carefully established, but by this stage  over two hours in  this reviewer's patience had long since been exhausted.

The movie on the other hand is incredibly disappointing. The acting is on par with your local community theater; most of the actors sound like they're reciting lines from a script, and give no personality to the characters. There was a tremendous lack of character development, including Rudy, one of the key characters in the book. Rudy and Liesel's relationship is never quite developed, and is mostly implied, until the end. Rudy's body is pulled from the rubble, and he's alive (...and he wasn't in the book.) long enough to tell Liesel that he l-l-l-loves her (...which he never did in the book.).

Death, the narrator of the book, sounds like a pretentious Englishman in the movie, reciting lines from a book.

All movies change various aspects of the book so that it all fits within a 2 hour movie. What was changed was needlessly changed. A remarkable book was adapted into a sub-par movie. My lasting impression was that the director didn't care about the book, and was just doing a job. He didn't take care to, or was not skilled enough to translate an incredible book into an incredible movie.

THE BOOK THIEF is the most poignant and haunting film that I have seen in some time, one that will stay with me for years. Sophie Nlisse gives an outstanding performance as Liesel Meminger, an initially illiterate but incredibly imaginative and independent girl who's full of splendid metaphors and similes --e.g., ""The sun looks like a silver oyster""--and, with the help of various diverse people, discovers the power of books and the written word while living with foster parents in Hitler's Germany. Virtually every other player in this film gives a fine performance, and the very special narrator, Roger Allam as the somber yet strangely unforbidding voice of Death, adds a distinct touch, coming in at just the right crucial moments.

I have never seen anything remotely like THE BOOK THIEF and can only say that I wish there were more like it. The best way I can describe it is like a dark yet ultimately heartwarming Disney film for adults. It is, of course, a Fox 2000 production expertly directed by Englishman Brian Percival, spoken mostly in English--albeit, with some speeches in German w/English subtitles--with a cast of various nationalities. Still, the characters are all most convincingly German. It captures the lives of ordinary German citizens during WWII in a way I've never seen done in any non-German film. The accents and various mannerism are very, very real and immediate. The cinematography is also excellent, with stunning views of the town and countryside and, even when viewed from approaching Allied bombers, the sky above them. THE BOOK THIEF is driven mostly by its characters, themes, and atmosphere. Nevertheless, even if it takes a while to find itself, the plot also makes perfect sense (allowing for the various elements of magical realism), moves at a natural pace, and is ultimately quite gripping.

Though I loved every second of this film, a common criticism seems to be that it simply does not do justice to Markus Zusak's original novel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Book-Thief/dp/0375842209/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Book Thief</a>. Film adaptations, of course, often make serious departures from the books that spawned them, and it's fairly impossible to completely capture a really great novel on screen. Though I have not yet read the novel, I could tell that the directors and writers had a lot to pick and choose regarding what/whatnot to show. There are a few patchy spots: In particular, I wanted a little better sense of Liesel's origins. In this respect, I can only say that this film should prove an excellent illuminator for the book, which I am now eager to read.",1393200000,,2688,5.232018561484919

This film, from the cinematography, the story, the characters, the set and costume designs, just everything really was done so well. It really came alive.
It was such a heartbreaking time. I cried more than a couple times while watching. Still, this movie was told in a way that you needed those incredibly sad moments.
The little girl, her story is one that will stay with me for a long time. Fiction or not. Some little girl a really long time ago lived a story much like hers I'd bet. Actually, probably a lot of little girls. That connection is what I will remember.

This is a movie for grownups, particularly the nascent ones as it speaks to young men and women directly about life, good and bad. One line that caught me was when the question was asked, ""Why were they so mean to me? (The Nazi Army folks) the answer was, ""Because you remind them of their humanity.""

All-too-often movies, and particularly those relating to Nazi Germany, are ""overcooked"", shallow and/or campy by virtue of getting off focus. Almost like the filmmaker had a case of ADHD and got distracted. Not so this film. I could not take my eyes off of Liesel  (Sophie Nlisse). Same for Hans (Geoffrey Rush)

More was said by silence than in any other film I've seen in a LONG time. Another way to say this is that the signal-to-noise ratio was superb, as is this movie.

This movie however was just so slow moving and at times so boring I found it hard to stay focused on. The innocence of the little girl set against the backdrop of Nazi Germany is a great contrast and a good idea but the execution was lacking. I wasn't expecting an action movie or anything but it was just so slow that I really couldn't get into it. Also this is one of the most depressing things I have ever seen so the fact that it was very slow and depressing makes it hard for me to recommend. Overall, sad and slow.

It follows the life of a young girl who is abandoned by her mother and placed in foster care with a couple who also take in a young Jewish man who puts the entire family at risk. It give us a glimpse of what life might have been like for children similar to this during the time the Nazi party controlled Germany. At times terrifying, at times humorous, it will surely give you a full range of emotions. The production is simply stunning from the first rate performances to the sets that portray a very realistic image of this small German town. Young Sophie Nelisse plays a very believable character as the young girl, Liesel and Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson, the adoptive parents, are equally believable. I know that this book is required reading for many middle schoolers and would highly recommend that they watch this film as well. It portrays so well life in 1938 Germany from the Hitler youth groups to the book burning, the anti-Jewish propaganda, and the brainwashing that ordinary people endured.  It certainly opens up for discussion why all of these people bought into the Nazi regime.

Youth comments: Out of all the movies I've ever seen, this one is the saddest. ""The Book Thief"" is a fantastic film that would make everyone who sees it cry, laugh, enjoy and be at the edge of their seats.  This movie has so much to watch - a tiny bit of comedy, sadness, history, suspense, thrilling scenes, intense, a bit of violence and, of course, theft.
The story begins when a young girl is on her way with her sick brother to live with a new family. Sadly, the brother dies along the way. The girl is left alone with a new mother, a new father and stuck in Germany during World War II. Her family does a lot of scary things and it's a very sad story as well.
The movie has so much history. I am Jewish so I cried quite a lot when I watched it. The facts are very accurate and very well done. The actors are stupendous. They are sad, happy, scared, brave and a lot more. The special affects and the thrilling way this film is done is amazing. This film is one of those films that made me cry. I wanted to go back in time so I could change Hitler's childhood to convince him to be nicer, kinder and not kill people. This movie is definitely big, intense and memorable.
My favorite scene is a happy one. The family is hiding a Jew in their basement. The father (Geoffrey Rush) is a bit of a goof so he gets a lot of snow and they start a snow fight in the basement. For once, the mother plays along, and the girl builds a snow man. There they are huddled against each other, listening to the father play an accordion and feeling happy despite what is happening in the outside world. Because the movie is so intense, I recommend it for ages 11 to 18. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and would recommend that everyone watch this film and think about what happened in the past. We all have responsibility to make sure that this history doesn't repeat itself.  Reviewed by KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Gerry O,

5809044,3,B00DHJT5Q6,"I wanted to like this film so very much. I'm a literature teacher at an international high school, and I have been teaching The Book Thief to my English II students for two years. So much of the magic and power of the book is in the way it is told. The narrator, Death, sees the world in colors--it's a method of distraction from the horrors of unnecessary deaths of thousands of war victims. Death is haunted by the senselessness all around him. However, when he continues to run into Liesel, he falls in love with the beauty that is also present in humans. This is the dichotomy of Death's experience--how can so much good and so much evil come from the same source? What is powerful enough to survive the devastation of evil?

I know that book to film transfers are rarely satisfactory, but I was really looking forward to seeing the artistic nature of the book interpreted visually in film...sadly, the color imagery did not transfer to the silver screen. I was also looking forward to seeing the dynamic character development of the very human characters...plus in the book, Liesel is quite a daring, spunky little girl with very human traits. She doesn't always do things for the right reasons, but she always follows her heart.

I suppose people who have not read the book might enjoy the film. But unfortunately the film only takes the framework of about 1/3 of the story, changing details for no apparent reason, leaves out key characters, and fails to develop the complex elements of any of the characters, including the narrator.

5809057,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"""The Book Thief"" is one of the most powerfully heartfelt films to come down the pike in recent years.  There are some films that stay with you long after the credits have run their course.  For hours, and perhaps even days, you find that you can't think of much else.  These are the movies that stay with you forever.  I have literally seen several thousand movies in my 42 years of life, but I can only think of a handful that I would consider memorable enough to stay permanently etched upon my heart.  This is one of those films.

The story takes place during World War II, and interestingly enough, it is narrated by Death.  Death observes the strange behavior of humans and observes that the only certainty in life is that everyone dies.  No one can avoid it, and yet some people spend a lifetime dwelling upon it. War affects everyone.  It doesn't matter which ""side"" you're on.  The reality of war is no one is left untouched by it.  Death, of course, does not discriminate.

""The Book Thief"" tells the story of Liesel, a precociously beautiful girl who finds herself being left by her mother with a couple in a small German town.  She doesn't understand why her mother gave her up, and she finds her new mother to be like a ""thunderstorm,"" and a father who has a warm and gentle heart.

We find that Liesel has no formal education, and she is laughed at by her peers at school for being unable to read or write.  Her only book in her possession is about grave-digging.  However, she quickly finds solace and a joy in words.  Her father encourages her to develop a love for reading and writing.  A large wall in the basement with the letters of the alphabet are designed for her to write any new words she finds in books which she has developed a voracious appetite for.

As Nazi Germany quickly takes control of the town, a young Jewish man, named Max, hides with the family.  Liesel is quickly fascinated by the newcomer, and she develops a loving friendship with him.  Upon learning of Liesel's love for books, Max explains to her that words are life.

Liesel also develops a friendship with Rudy, the first person to truly welcome Liesel to her new home and her new town.  It's obvious that Rudy has quickly fallen in love with Liesel, and the budding friendship is truly beautiful to behold.

Liesel lives in a world dominated by a political machine that encourages book-burning, hatred toward ""inferior"" people, and oppression by the military.  She doesn't understand it, and she quickly finds a growing distaste and bitterness toward it.  Her greatest fear is that she may one day lose all of those whom she loves.  Sometimes we forget that not everyone in Germany supported Nazism and that there were plenty of people who tried their best to help those who were oppressed and abused.

Geoffrey Rush is fantastic as Hans.  He is one my favorite actors, and he never disappoints.  He plays Hans with such warmth and depth.  It becomes quickly clear that he adores Liesel, and he showers her with that love.

Emily Watson is equally good as Rosa.  She's a hard woman who seems exactly as Liesel describes her: a thunderstorm, but we also quickly realize that Rosa has a heart of gold, despite her complaints and the constant berating of Hans and Liesel.  Rosa is trying to keep some organization of her home, and it's obvious that she fears what may eventually happen to them all.

However, this film really belongs to Sophie Nelisse.  This young girl has a bright future ahead of her.  I've always observed that the finest actors can act without saying a word, and Sophie does this remarkably well.  She is able to capture Liesel's innocence, a sense of naivety, and intelligence with a simple look.  Those blue eyes seem able to light up a room as well as everyone around her.  Sophie gives us that type of character in Liesel.  Death states that he is ""haunted by humans,"" and the irony is that it is obvious that he is haunted by Liesel and her purity of heart and timeless grace.  After watching this film, the audience can't help but share in that feeling.

The story and the cast are first-rate.  I really don't know how anyone can watch this film and not be moved by it as well as being completely captivated by Liesel.  I am certainly captivated by her; so much so that I am already more than eager for another viewing!

Movies like this one are rare, and I am always so appreciative that films like this one are being made.  Indeed, I find myself haunted by them.",1389657600,3,4485,4.5418227215980025

Unknown to her at this time, her mother was taken away because she was a communist. Liesel lives with some good Germans who care for her as their own. Liesel is illiterate but takes a shine to reading. She gets engrossed in reading books, while her loving adopted Papa (Geoffrey Rush) walks the fine line by hiding Max (Ben Schnetzer) a Jew whose father saved his life in WWI. The film gets its title from the fact Liesel would steal (and then return) books from the Burgermeister.

The film contains both the feeling on impending doom and hope simultaneously. I felt like I was reading poetry while I watched the film. It was that well done. The performances were spectacular.

Must see film for those who love a great movie. It is Oscar worthy.",1389484800,,912,4.6234567901234565
5809059,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"This film had a very limited release in this country. Sadly, it was in and out of the few theaters that bothered to (or was allowed to market it) before you could even find the movie listings in the paper. I can only hope that it did well in New York and other concentrated Jewish communities in various cities.
Even though this is one of countless holocaust era films, this one rivals Schindler's List in quality of acting, directing, photography, story line; all in a PG rating temperament.
Probably, the most poignant statement to be said about this production is that with a proper edit or prologue this film quite fittingly deserves to be shown at any church, synagogue or school to anyone over the age of ten.",1389398400,2,715,4.59375
5809060,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"""The Book Thief"" is a drama genre film set in Germany, mainly during World War II. The narrative follows Liesel Meminger who is put into foster care with Hans and Rosa Hubermann.

As the story unfolds the written word becomes a special bond between Liesel and her new family and friends, despite the anxiety of Nazi persecuting rhetoric and war.

Outstanding acting provides notable personality to all the characters, and the viewer becomes easily connected to Liesel and those close to her.

The movie reaches deeply into the emotions of the viewer by conveying the fragility of what is so dear to Liesel, and her own mortality.

5809061,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"I didn't even know about this from the book and went to the theater after my friends rejected Catching Fire. It was the best film-going decision I think I've ever made.

Everything was excellent in this, from the acting and accents (mostly German, which is appropriate since they were in Germany. I hate it when American movies always put British accents in the place of anyone foreign!) set design and wardrobe to the cinematography. Most importantly, the story and motifs were right up there with the all-time greats.

It's pro education, anti-fascism, pro-life (interesting since the narrator is Death, himself), anti-bigotry. It has everything including a brilliant scene in which two little school children yell, ""I hate Hitler!"" How can you not love that?

It's sweet, thought-provoking, and compelling. Everyone should watch this as soon as they can!",1388880000,7,857,5.195652173913044
5809062,5,B00DHJT5Q6,"Director Brian Percival brilliantly presents a film centered in a child's heart, fully complimented by John Williams' achingly beautiful score. This is quite an achievement. Percival has had to render devastating themes and moments, and yet an exquisite sweetness pervades the movie, more so on second and subsequent viewings, as the adults in a foster girl's life care for the innocence of her spirit. Critics took this to be a cheapening of the backdrop time period. But that misses the very point of its setting: beauty endures amidst the ashes. ""We were just being people""--how powerfully vulnerable this movie is. Percival's handling has not just made the story's intense suffering bearable; he has kept it meaningful.

This is a movie rich in faces, in unspoken visual connections between characters suited to the guardedness of the time. Anyone who is touched by the rich expressiveness of children's faces will delight in Sophie Nelisse as Leisl. Equally inspiring is the connection that Hans Hubermann shares with his foster daughter--Geoffrey Rush's childlike playfulness trancends what otherwise could have been a morose role. Hans' is an ordinary life, well-lived in desperate times. The tone of the relationship between Hans and Leisl carries over to all her subsequent relationships. By gently eliciting her trust at her moment of devastation, Hans gifts Leisl with the ability to discover humanity throughout her world. I found this aspect of the story very inspiring. This personal gifting opens the door to the other giftings the bereft girl will receive in the written word, which, of course, is the ""title theme"" of the story. The intensely personal dimension of words... written and read...as well as unspoken and repressed... undergirds the entire movie.

Which leads me to Emily Watson's complex and deeply satisfying performance as Leisl's foster mother. I've seen criticism of the book based on the profane name Watson's character uses for Leisl (untranslated in the movie), but it is an authentic emblem of her character... the heart that disguises itself with harshness. So many of the characterizations in this movie could have fallen flat, but Rush, Watson, and the entire crew bring an authenticity to the story that silences the people talking in the back row of the theater. This movie simply overwhelms you in a way that expands your own humanity. Instead of just chastening our spirits with what humanity can be in its awfulness, the narrator guides us into the intriguing and hauntingly inspiring possibilities of the human spirit. And that makes a movie well worth seeing again and again.

Speaking of ""again and again"", read Jon Broxton's view of the ""Book Thief"" soundtrack and then get the CD. His insights into the film and score are worth reading.",1388188800,21,2787,5.161504424778761

Zusak is an amazing writer, and the director of this movie got it right, from the actors and actresses to the scenery, it's epic and will have you feeling like you are right there--a part of Liesel's world.

The Book Thief is a beautifully told story that shows the strong bond of family, even when one is adopted into a family.  Through the life of this little girl we learn about love, sacrifice, loyalty, a hunger for learning, and the threads of humanity that bind us all together.
