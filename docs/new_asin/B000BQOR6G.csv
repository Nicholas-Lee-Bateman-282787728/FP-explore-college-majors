8091102,5,B000BQOR6G,"The French baroque is now overshadowed (as indeed is everyone else's baroque) by the German baroque, and particularly by The Big Two, Bach and Handel, who brought the form (insofar as there is a single baroque form) to such a pitch of perfection that there was really nothing left to say. Although French baroque was influential in its day (both Bach and Handel used ""overtures in the French style"" in their works), it has to be said that the major French composers of the era, Lully, the Couperins, Delalande, etc. were quite simply not in the same class. In addition, much of the music was routine stuff churned out under the domineering Lully like sausages from a sausage machine for the court and entertainments of Louis XIV at Versailles. Having said that, there are still many gems in the French baroque that deserve a hearing. They have a lightness and graciousness that is all their own.

One of these, and sufficient to justify the price alone, is the Te Deum of the very accomplished Marc-Antoine Charpentier. It is universally known in Europe as ""The Eurovision Tune"" (Eurovision, the collaborative effort of Europe's national television channels, uses its opening fanfare as a theme tune), but there is much more to it than that. It is NOT the B Minor Mass, but it IS a bright, joyous hymn of praise, which gives lots of pleasure, and it is beautifully executed in a live recording in the chapel of Versailles by Martin Gester and his Strasbourg-based Parlement de Musique, with the Matrise de Bretagne choir from the other side of the country. Many previous versions of the work play it in a rather stiff, square fashion, as if trying to confer upon it a particular variety of solemnity. Not this one - it skips and bounces along, especially that opening prelude and the final great chorus, led out by two natural trumpets and some absolutely wonderfully sonorous and crisp-sounding timpani. Soloists, choir and orchestra are all superb.

One curious feature is that the Te Deum is preceded by some parts of Lully's ""Le Carrousel du Roy"" (trumpets and drums only), which are not credited.

Someone nice has put the whole Te Deum on YouTube.

Grab it before the copyright holder has it taken off. Yet, why should he/she/it/they complain? I found this on YouTube and had to have it. Without it, they at least wouldn't have my sale.

The disc starts off with the Charpentier T&eacute;n&egrave;bres Psalms, which, again, are splendidly played and sung.

Altogether a DVD that deserves a place in any choral music lover's collection. However, if you want it, I suggest trying amazon.uk, where it's a whole lot cheaper. And you'll need a universal player, as I don't think there's an NTSC version",1388707200,,2724,4.84516129032258
