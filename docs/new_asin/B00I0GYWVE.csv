6246260,3,B00I0GYWVE,"Some of the episodes are fun to watch and are entertaining.  However, some episodes are outright boring.  I don't regret buying them at a reasonable price, but I was a little disappointed.  The ""My Living Doll"" Series is much better.",1501632000,,233,4.775
6246261,1,B00I0GYWVE,I was not satisfied with my purchase.  Upon trying to play the discs they skipped in places and got stuck in others.  I am unable to watch them.,1488844800,,144,4.107142857142857
6246262,4,B00I0GYWVE,well I think its only a classic and its pretty hard to believe  your mother comes back as a car and its lame but its got the old style and clean actors and white dude which is getting very rare to see in  brown Hollywood,1390867200,4,220,3.8666666666666667

8638046,4,B00I0GYWVE,"The original KITT.  Very dated.  Not as funny as I remembered.  A cute show, none the less.  Jerry Van Dyke, always funny, could never seem to find the right part, until Coach.",1521590400,,176,4.40625

8638048,5,B00I0GYWVE,Actually it was for my autistic son Logan and he loves it.,1516838400,,58,3.9166666666666665
8638049,4,B00I0GYWVE,"I had a vague memory of the theme song and Jerry Van Dyke talking to his mother in the garage.

The picture resolution is fantastic.

The critics that wrote-off My Mother the Car as the worst TV series in history must have never seen The Trouble with Tracy (Canada, mid 1960s). My Mother the Car has a Disney feel to it (e.g. That Darn Cat, The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes, The Absent Minded Professor). It's just as good as other fantasy shows from that era (e.g. My Favorite Martian, Mr. Ed, Bewitched).

The Captain Manzini character is a bit cartoonish.

Perhaps Jerry Van Dyke was lucky that he took this role rather than the lead on Gilligan's Island. While Bob Denver is a TV icon, his career stalled as the Gilligan's Island clone, Dusty's Trail, rode off into the sunset.

There are two short-falls:
1) DVD-R rather than DVD: the menu reverts to an untitled list of chapters; the label on the disc looks glued on
2) The price on amazon.ca (Canada) was many times higher than on amazon.com. Even with the currency exchange, import duty and internationnal delivery charge, amazon.com was a much better deal.",1515974400,2,1113,4.658163265306122

8638051,2,B00I0GYWVE,I like  most  of the sixties sitcoms. But  Jerry van dyke  was not  funny in this  one .  The voice of the car was more funny. Lol,1509235200,,130,3.5925925925925926
8638052,5,B00I0GYWVE,"I am sure that this show was better in 1965 when I was 9 years old, but it still brought back good memories of Tuesday nights on NBC. A guilty pleasure of mine and so much better than a lot of the obscene stuff that passes for comedy these days. Now I can only hope that The Governor and J.J. becomes available.",1506297600,,311,4.032258064516129
8638053,5,B00I0GYWVE,I remember this show from when I was a kid.....not a great show but a cute oldie...,1506211200,,83,3.9411764705882355
8638054,5,B00I0GYWVE,My Mother the Car  Season One Volume One is really great. I've heard the theme song from this tv show and decided I'd check it out and see what Jerry Van Dyke brings to this classic show. This is a really funny show and it continues to entertain all the way through. Classic tv from the 1960's. This one is not to be missed.,1505779200,,324,4.0625
