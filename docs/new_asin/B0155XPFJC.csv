8732761,3,B0155XPFJC,"This is a 1994 movie directed by Italian director Enzo Castellari, the same one who directed the original Keoma (1976), and The Inglorious Bastards (1978). Despite the title, Keoma 2 is not a sequel to Keoma. In fact, the original title of this movie was Jonathan degli orsi (Jonathan of the bears). Main resemblance between this movie and the original Keoma has to do with Franco Nero's playing a similar looking character. In this movie, he plays a guy who, as a young boy, witness the slaughtering of his parents on the hands of some white men killers while they travel west on a wagon. The boy is subsequently adopted by the Indians. As an adult, he will be forced to face a powerful guy (played icon star John Saxon) and his gang who arrives to the near town to put his hands on the recently discovered oil. During this struggle, his infant memories will come back to Jonathan... So, the film is entertaining enough (not as much compared with Keoma though), and touches some sensitive themes such as racism, the use and overuse of natural resources at costs. The film has very moving moments, including the killing of the boys parents, and later, the natural death of his adoptive Indian father. I especially liked the recreation of an Indian burial ground, a very well achieved detail indeed. So, overall, I would recommend this movie as a touching western.

Technically, the DVD transfer is very good. The image is crisp clear and comes in widescreen format, and runs for 115 min. Audio comes in English and German (or Deutsch?) with no subtitles. Extras include the trailer and trailers of two more movies.

FINAL NOTE: International Movie Data Base announced Director Enzo Castellari would deliver Keoma Rises during 2017, a film that would also include Franco Nero in the cast.",1475539200,,1787,4.7799352750809065
