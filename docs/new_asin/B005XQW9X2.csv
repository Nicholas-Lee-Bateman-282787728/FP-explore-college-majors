4903919,5,B005XQW9X2,"I purchased this for my wife for Christmas.  She likes the fact that there are different levels of difficulty (although she still hasn't progressed beyond the first one).  I tried the easiest one and got quite a workout myself. I would say I thought it went just a tiny bit fast for a beginner but in defense of the video, it did say to watch it once before trying to do it.",1365638400,,374,4.180555555555555
4903920,3,B005XQW9X2,"Very disappointed when they see the video can not be translated into Spanish, it's my fault I did not read that detail the time of purchas.",1359936000,,139,4.384615384615385
4903921,4,B005XQW9X2,"The HD graphics are great, the exercises (YOGA) look great, but the background sound (the music for the relaxation of yoga) is very poor.
I don't like the voice of the male instructor,  his voice actually gets on my nerves. I was excited to get this 4 disc set, but Im very disappointed that the background music quality is so poor, and that the male instructors voice is so annoying. Not sure if I'll keep the set.",1359417600,2,415,4.3896103896103895
4903922,2,B005XQW9X2,"I am new to yoga and was hoping to use this as a starter.  Unfortunately, I damaged two of the discs due to the poor packaging.  The 4 blu rays are stacked on top of each other and are extremely difficult to remove.  I did not seek a refund as I damaged the videos myself, but this could have been prevented with improved packaging.  Very frustrating.  I was able to watch the 1st/basic video and the quality is just average and no different than DVD quality.  Further, it just feels scripted as if read from a teleprompter and lacks passion and authenticity.  I really wasn't able to compare it to other Yoga instructional videos, but my wife who is familiar with yoga and has more advanced DVDs noted the product was subpar.  I was really hoping for better with this one.",1357603200,,773,4.432624113475177
4903923,5,B005XQW9X2,"I've never done Yoga, and wasn't sure what to expect. This has 3 or 4 disks and each class has 3 people showing you the beginner, intermediate, and hard positions. I don't think I could do a whole session without cheating a little, but I feel so much better doing this and getting stronger every time. People don't realize the importance of flexibility and how it benefits you in so many ways. I don't have anything to compare this with, since it's my first time doing Yoga, but it was worth it if your a beginner. I forgot to mention, that I threw my back out a while ago, and while picking up my work bag at a wrong angle I almost threw it out again. So I knew I needed to be more active and have more flexibility. I've only done the first two disk, and my back feels 100% better. I'm not worried about throwing it out again, since I'm strengthing  my lower back, and whole body for that matter. If you don't work out in the gym much, I def believe now that stretching/yoga should be done by everyone.",1356048000,4,1003,4.223958333333333
4903924,5,B005XQW9X2,"I have only used disc one so far, but I enjoyed the workout. It is great to do as a morning stretch, or just when you aren't up to a full cardio workout, but you want to do something.",1346889600,,183,3.717948717948718
4903925,5,B005XQW9X2,"I bought this on a bit of a whim and was very impressed. I have bought a few yoga dvds that, after one play, I know I will never play again...this is not one of those.

There are four dvds in this set, making it a good value for the money, as the cost is less than I have paid in the past for a thirty minute dvd. There are not a lot of 'extras' with these dvds, like matrix-style programming, just four straight ahead yoga sessions.

The set is attractive enough (indoors) and the presenters all appear to be ""real"" people, meaning that they all appear to be regular people who do a lot of yoga, as opposed to hired fitness models who seem awkward in the yoga poses. As a guy (with a bad back, which is what brought me to yoga) these are dvds that I can easily have on if a buddy drops by without feeling awkward about a 'girlie'-type of yoga dvd playing. There is also no guy, like Rodney Yee, wearing WAY too tight shorts (you're going to shear it off there) or Bryan Kest being kind of creepy and 'Vogue-ing' around in his dvds (that dvd got binned quick). No Shiva Rea jumping around, expressing herself, with fake Hindu statues or groovy guys playing drums as they dance in the background, gimme a break.

It irks me a wee bit that much of the marketing of yoga is aimed at women still, when in fact yoga has broken out of that ghetto some time ago. Athletes, military trainers, and others incorporate yoga (or yoga-like) practices now to promote back care and joint stabilization. I used to equate yoga with ""stretching"", but now realize that this back/joint stability is what I am finding useful in yoga. I digress.

The four dvds are 'basic', 'core', 'strength' an 'vinyasa', no need to elaborate. The vinyasa dvd I enjoy immensely. In the introduction, the instructor states that the root word of ""vinyasa"" means ""to place intelligently"", or words to that effect. This routine fits that bill. Postures move from one to another nicely, and there are moves I have not seen in other dvds that are...intelligent, that is not trying to be different for different's sake.

The flow is not as frenetic as some, and is a bit more...deliberate, so those who want a total sweat-fest might not be as happy. To each their own.

Conclusion, great value for the money. Four hours of legitimate routines for not a lot of bucks. Good routines (with no embarrassing personalities) hitting different areas, I would say get this, and you will not be disappointed.",1345939200,26,2454,4.503370786516854
4903926,5,B005XQW9X2,"This DVD is a must-see!  The 8 Limbs Yoga Centers teachers sequence four incredible classes focusing on strength, flexibility, endurance, technique and relaxation.  The classes are accessible, yet challenging.  You can easily follow the instructions just by listening; the beautiful visuals are an added benefit.  I highly recommend this product.",1328659200,8,346,5.86
8488867,5,B005XQW9X2,This item is perfect!,1451347200,,21,4.5
8488868,3,B005XQW9X2,"so if you can't do the ""relax"" version well everything else is a lil too difficult. I do like the breathing attention they give, the ""area"" where they are doing yoga is not that nice however is a good DVD to start yoga",1423958400,,218,4.093023255813954
8488869,5,B005XQW9X2,Great DVD for beginners!,1419897600,,24,5.25
8488870,4,B005XQW9X2,Great value. One thing to know is the disc titled Basics is not for beginners. It is clear that it expects you to already know the basic positions and it goes at a pretty fast rate. Definitely watch before trying. For absolute beginners I would recommend taking an actual class or find another source.,1416355200,,301,4.592592592592593
8488871,5,B005XQW9X2,I really like this series of Blu-Ray discs. It is easy to keep up with and a nice way to unwind after work.,1416268800,,107,3.6956521739130435
8488872,2,B005XQW9X2,"Sorry about this - I wish I had not purchased this one - much too fast for me to follow. I am not new to yoga, but this is unrelenting - seems to be a showcase for the teachers!",1413331200,,177,3.5641025641025643

8488874,3,B005XQW9X2,"So I was initially really excited about the ability to do yoga from home. Never gone to an actual yoga class, was just going to jump right in based off the discs. It tells you to watch first before trying. The videos are a little dry but they do get to the point. I found it to be a little fast and kind of difficult for someone who had never tried before.  I might try giving the videos another shot but all in all, I don't think they're for me.",1397520000,,446,3.9555555555555557
8488875,5,B005XQW9X2,Great set!  Moves quickly but offers all levels.  Not distracting with loud music or background and the instructor is clear in her instruction,1393200000,,142,5.130434782608695
8488876,5,B005XQW9X2,"I am a beginner and this help me get started. At first I could only get through 15 minutes of the beginners tape. I have now worked up to almost the whole hour of it. Each time, it get's better and better and the workout makes me feel so good at the end. Overall, easy to learn and I look forward to progressing to the next level as soon as I can. The strength and elasticity I get from this has been fantastic.",1368662400,,411,3.963855421686747
