Many large cattle ranches are found among the turpentine pine forests of Florida and Georgia. Millie has roped a calf, her family is going hungry because the pine forests were burned down to create grasslands for cattle. Gene is generous. The Cattlemen's Association wants to burn off all the pine forests to create more land for grazing cattle. But Gene objects to burning land on the open range, free to all. Who has been stealing all that cattle? Burning the forests can kill the turpentiners who live there. [Does a disregard for lives show a hidden guilt?] Millie explains Gene's help. [Note her authentic bare feet.] The fires are set. The turpentiners open fire on the mounted cattlemen. Will they be trapped by the fire? Gene attacks the turpentiners and rescues his Dad. The others turn his father against Gene!

Gene is now a singer in show business. There is comedy, then a run-away wagon. Gene stops it. Then he goes to inspect the cattle in that meadow. Were they stolen? Back in town there is music. The conversation of two men tells of their cattle theft. Gene escapes from captivity, and is pursued. The `Wild West Show' goes on. The ""Tennessee Ramblers"" sing for the audience, and provide comedy with unconventional musical instruments. Will Gene appear in time? Yes, its ""show business"", they will use a double to act for Gene. Later Gene finds his dead Dad, with a clue pointing to Baylor Bainem. Baylor is dead when Gene arrives, a stolen gun is the murder weapon. A frame-up! Millie tries to help Gene in jail. The turpentiners arrive armed in town to get Gene, but he escapes. Parker made a mistake when he substituted his cattle for the stolen herd. Gene has the Bill of Sale for the Circle A cattle and will tell the Sheriff.

Gunshots tell of the conflict in town between the turpentiners and the cattlemen. Gene will try to stop this by catching Parker, who stole cattle and tried to put the blame on the turpentiners so he could profit from the conflict. The men from the show ride up. ""Every man for himself."" Will Parker get away? Not with Gene after him. The people celebrate the capture. Gene sings to Millie.

This story is a change from the conventional drama set in the southwest, but follows the traditional forms. There is business conflict, wrongful accusations, exoneration, and the revelation of the hidden guilt of a prominent person. The differences make it better. The shorter length of these Westerns eliminates the padding put into longer movies.",1290038400,,2531,4.758542141230068
