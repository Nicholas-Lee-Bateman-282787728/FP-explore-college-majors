2553394,5,B000F6XMVS,"I can not thank the vendor more for the excellent copy of this movie - perfect quality! As to the movie itself - MUST HAVE for those who: 1) love Aamir Khan's performances, 2) enjoy poetry, 3) eager for good and unusual story line, 4) appreciate good songs and memorable & catchy music, etc. This is one of the BEST Aamir's movie and you will NOT be disappointed - fantastic performance by Aamir, Kajol and Rishi Kapoor. Highly recommend this movie!!!",1265241600,,451,4.580246913580247
2553395,5,B000F6XMVS,"Kajol's re-entrance into acting could not have come in a better film. She simply SHINED! As for Aamir, he was not to be outshined. The plot alone was overwhelmingly superb, then to be performed by such phenomenal performers brings the movie to life. It is truly a love story within a love story - a love for another person and one for your country. The only question is, which one is stronger?",1259884800,,393,4.472222222222222
2553396,5,B000F6XMVS,"I highly recommend this movie for both the action buff and the fan's of love stories. We begin with the life of a sheltered only child Zooni(Kajol) who ventures into the metro city of New Delhi. In the city, Zooni meets Rehan (Aamir Khan), the playboy tour guide and we have love at first. From this point on, the audience is playing catch-up with the excellent, unpredictable, screenplay of Shibani Bathija. With the usual Bollywood musical scenes for taste, this movie has great acting from the leads and the supporting actors and actresses (which includes my personal favorite, Tabu). The plot unfolds with much twist and turns, to a realistic and dramatic ending.",1255219200,,667,4.911504424778761
2553397,5,B000F6XMVS,"This is the story of a blind girl (Kajol) who visits Delhi and falls in love with a tour guide (Aamir Khan). She is pure-hearted and can love him deeply. He has never loved and regards women as 'countries to pass through, rest while and move on'. He also has a dark side she doesn't know of. However he falls for her and decides to change his life and marry her. As they await her parents for the wedding, she undergoes an operation to restore her sight then there is a bomb blast and it looks like he is killed. To say more would be to ruin the movie.
I hesitated long before buying this. The reviews rated it highly but talked of 'shocking' bits - and I don't like graphic or very violent movies. If you have been in the same dilemma - there wasn't anything graphic and any shock may have been in the characters dilemmas. There is shooting (mostly off camera) but really there is very little screen time that is violent in any way -and that is more symbolic and brief.
Overall it is a movie that has beautifully depicted romance between the leads and beautiful cinematography. The first half is mostly romance and the second half changes pace and builds in tension and dilemmas (but still has a lot of touching scenes and beauty as well).
Both Aamir and Kajol are first rate - as is Rishi Kapoor as the girls father.
This is one that both connects and tears at the heart strings. While there is sort song there isn't the big dance numbers and the music is generally haunting.
A fine production and a keeper. Elsewhere on the Net it tends to get above average. I was wavering between 4 and 5 as it is probably a 4 1/2. Recommended after all (despite pre-movie hesitancy!)",1242864000,,1672,4.362179487179487
2553398,5,B000F6XMVS,"I fell in love with Aamir Khan after watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mangal-Pandey/dp/B000FQ4LDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mangal Pandey</a>&nbsp;in an Indian History course and decided I must see more of his work. I saw&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lagaan-Once-Upon-a-Time-in-India/dp/B00005U124/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lagaan - Once Upon a Time in India</a>&nbsp;first (as it is one of the most readily available Indian films to the American audience) and loved it, but it is Fanaa that stands out for me.

It is a romantic, melodramatic film with a bit of Kashmiri politics thrown in, and cannot cannot be said to be on the same level as films like Lagaan, but I believe the performances by Aamir Khan and Kajol transcend the sometimes shaky plot.

Watching Zooni and Rehan discover each other throughout the first half of film kept me glued to the screen. The chemistry between Aaamir and Kajol is undeniable and Aamir's portrayal of a man falling in love against his best efforts is effortless and wonderfully effective.

By the second half of film, I had forgotten the plot conventions and was wrapped up completely in the love story of Rehan and Zooni.

Do yourself a favor: if you're looking for a romantic film that will undoubtedly sweep you off your feet, buy Fanaa!",1181433600,12,1379,5.88
2553399,5,B000F6XMVS,"I have a special regard for this movie, because I had the enormous luck to see it in the faboulous, incredibly ornate and atmospheric Raj Mandir theatre of Jaipur. Watching not just the film, but also the reactions of the audience -who were obviously enjoying the experience enormously and constantly and spontaneously expressing so- was a great delight.

""Fanaa"" is a concept taken from mysticism. In the world of mystic poetry ""fanaa"" was the point at which the mystic's own sense of self was destroyed or anihilated by his/her union with God. We are talking deep religion here and, in this context, that someone uses this word as a title for a Bollywood film can even sound a bit like sacrilege. The concept is, though, brilliantly used by the writer and applied simply to ""True Love"" a rare event which, arguably, contains a spark of the divine, and that ordinary people can, ever so rarely -but not so much as mystic love-, experience in this life.

Zooni (Kajol) is a blind girl who has lived protected -and isolated- all her life by the love and warmth of her family, who have raised her like the fragile maiden princess of a fairy tale. When she must set out for the big city, Delhhi, and be appart from her parents for the first time, she jokes with them about the possibility of finding there ""her prince"". Big poetic irony -we, the audience, realize instantly. ""And what shall I tell my prince when I find him?"", Zooni asks her mother; ""May my life be destroyed in your love!!!"" answers the mother, quoting poetry.

And Zooni meets Rehan (Aamir Khan)whom nobody would take as a prince at first, or even second or third, sight. But Zooni, being blind, is not blinded by appearances, and soon recognizes the prince in Rehan...even though he is bent on proving otherwise. What will you have from the clash between the innocent, virginal princess who believes Love is everything and the worldwise, cynical casanova who believes in nothing? Comedy or drama? This being Bollywood, you are served, but of course, both.

Thus, the story begins as a romantic comedy, and I must declare right now my profound admiration for a writer who choses a ""verse war"" as the first confrontation between the protagonists, and has them trying to outwit each other in a rhyming challenge. My admiration peaks when, in the first song, the composers and writer manage to use the concept of ""fanaa"" inside a teasing, seductive piece, full of sensuality and inviting temptation, in which Rehan expresses the -very unromantic- attraction he feels for Zooni.

But soon the easygoing romance becomes drama when Zooni, fully aware of Rehan's lack of belief in love or any other thing human or divine, fully aware of his intentions, decides to follow her own beliefs unto the ultimate consequences: she decides to love, even if hers is unrequited love....And Zooni pronounces the magical words, ""May my life be destroyed in your love!!"" Symbolically, what she goes through in Delhi makes her SEE....and also literally. But then, fate strikes in the very contemporary form of terrorism and the story takes a sharp turn...after the intermission.

The second time the writer and composers use the concept of ""fanaa"" is very different from the first, and one of the most beautiful love songs I've ever heard, but I can't explain any more without including several spoilers.....

This film suffered from some controversy in India. One of its main stars, Aamir Khan, made some public comments about the eviction of entire villages in the state of Gujarat towards the creation of a gigantic water reservoir. He commented particularly on the unfairness of having thousands of people thrown out of their houses, living on the streets. The BJP (nationalists, ruling the state of Gujarat) were instantly incensed, and so was the Congress Party (ruling India), and they asked the actor for a public apology. Aamir Khan, quite a politically-minded person, refused. As a result, ""Fanaa"" was banned in the state of Gujarat and, when one theatre owner dared go against this ban, the consequences were quite horrid.

What else can I say? Everybody in this film (and regarding the actors I must say that Kajol is charming and very princess-like, but Aamir Khan definitely RULES and totally steals the show) have managed to create here a classical Bollywood, one that touches several genres from comedy to drama and thriller, throwing in, as Bollywood will usually have it of late, a pinch of politics, patriotism, terrorism -maybe the Furies that control our fates in the present times-....and all apparently effortlessly revolving around the concept of ""fanaa"": the limits to which one is prepared to go for love, and the power of a feeling that can give or take life.",1167264000,62,4730,4.889027431421447
2553400,5,B000F6XMVS,"Fanaa is a film about a blind girl (from the hills with two loving parents) who falls in love with a guide. Delhi is shown in all of it's life and the camerawork in the film is staggering. The music of the film adds much likeable delirium to its undeniable gravity. I didn't know what quite to expect out of an Amir Khan film. Nothing against the actor but I quite disliked his last 2 films (RDB and Mangal Pandey). In Fanaa, his performance stands out from his roles in the past. I am not going to give any spoilers away.

If someone was relating the story to me, I would be very confused. However, when I watched the film, the ease with which the direction captivates and the scene by scene anxiety induced irony - made sure that I was totally hooked. Kajol is excellent in this film. Her stupid delinquent girly gestures have disappeared and there is no room for cheap comedy. The humor of the film has a rather low volumed baritone. The movie is like an adventure, Aamir looks great and Kajol looks beautiful, for once.

What else can I say? I watched this movie alone at the theater (first time for me) and although it was half empty, I knew this film is not meant for all audiences. Fans of Veer Zara will probably like this film more than Veer Zara. Despite the chaos, the sometimes exaggerated irony, there is something very RIGHT about this film and it strikes just the right cord for an emotionally charaged DRAMA enthusiast like me. The mountains, the capital, the bus-rides, the gardens, the helicopters, the few action scenes, just about everything felt quite perfect and adequate. Excellent editing, I might as well add.

I'm an Aamir Khan fan again and finally a Kajol fan, too.

Subhaan Alla

P.S - Two better films this year were ""Lage Raho Munnabhai"" & ""Gangster"". This is the third best, in my staunch opinion.",1159660800,9,1829,4.513595166163142

They miss very shot, while he takes out the good guys with a knife and downs the helicopter with a handgun! Toward the end, Kajol's character, instead of doing the obvious thing and tossing away the nuclear trigger the terrorist needs, hands it to him. At the end, she  has apparently come to ignore all his prior terrorist acts. Oh yes, the star anti-terrorist is a woman, and the men are fairly dumb.

2553437,5,B000F6XMVS,"Khan delivers once again! Super well done. Over-the-top melodramatics, yes, some weird, unnatural responses from supporting actors and goofy choreography - but this is the Bollywood genre. The child actor is remarkably talented. A completely enjoyable film with a couple of artfully placed plot twists.

The extra disc with a special added feature of an interview between the two stars was a giant, sloppy deal-breaker. Kajol behaves with arrogance, contempt and a boorish air that renders a beautiful and sensitive actress on screen to the sadly common condition of an ill-tempered brat. Her bad behavior is suffered graciously by Khan, who is if not good-natured under attack, obviously capable of behaving like a true gentleman.",1436140800,,731,5.356521739130435

The first half is sunny, youthful, and exhilarating while the second half is dramatic, emotional, and realistic.  I classify it as a modern Romeo and Juliet story, although the trials the two young lovers must undergo are quite different.  The ending is unbelievable, although it is the only way in which it could possibly end. Definitely one of my favorite movies of all time.

2553457,5,B000F6XMVS,"The worst part about Fanaa is that my husband did not see it with me. Which means, I spent the entire next day, contemplating it with no one to talk to about it. Aaaaghhh! It also meant that in order to talk to him about it I had to explain the plot. Which is no simple task, this is after all a Bollywood film.

Before I go any further, let me just say, this is a GREAT movie. I gave it 5 stars and definitely recommend it. It is fabulously acted. This is the best role I have seen Kajol in. Ever. Aamir is incredible in it. He goes from romantic comedy song and dance to a deep pathos. He is totally believable and charming and devastating in turn. Very few actors have that sort of range. He does.

Now, as to why I desperately needed to discuss this movie. If you have ever seen a Bollywood movie, you know you basically get two movies for the price of one. The first hour and a half-ish sets up our characters, after the intermission, you get another hour or so that basically takes off where the first movie ends and gives our characters a new situation to deal with. Often, the 2nd half involves a twist. You will also know that if our characters even so much as kiss (even married couples), something bad is going to have to happen to them. And no, our couple is not seen kissing. But they do something else that is definitely a no no and so, I knew something bad was going to happen, but how bad, given that they hadn't kissed, was unclear and things seemed to be going well around intermission time. Knowing all this I was completely unprepared for the second half of this movie!  It was a total departure from the first part. The first half of the movie is a beautiful and fun romantic comedy with singing and dancing. The second half is a lot like Cape Fear. Needless to say, it's a bit of an emotional roller coaster ride. Well worth it though.

At the end, the moral lesson is clear. Morality is not about choosing between good and evil. It is about being prepared to choose between the greater of two goods or the lesser of two evils.",1333152000,2,2049,4.232736572890025

  I frequently fast-forward through music, but I greatly enjoyed listening to this this simple little gem of a melody.
(4) One delightful scene is the conclusion of a dance that some school girls are doing as part of a Republic Day celebration.  The dance concludes with an aerial view that shows the girls' deep saffron, white, and green costumes creating the horizontal bands of the Indian national flag.  I was momentarily distracted and puzzled by a single dancer in black (actually navy blue) who also happened to be spinning.  It was when I realized that she represented the wheel in the center of the flag, and that her wheel was literally spinning, that I spontaneously applauded my DVD player (and the choreographer and cinematographer).

Then the movie abruptly turned into 007, with explosions, chases, political intrigue and lots of deaths. The sudden switch was very jarring and I almost didn't keep watching. But I did, and found that the last part wove the two disparate parts together into a deeply emotionally engaging romantic drama reminiscent of Romeo and Juliet. So I enjoyed the story overall. And the music was absolutely wonderful; I immediately bought the soundtrack. Definitely worth watching.",1299283200,,660,5.12037037037037
2553466,3,B000F6XMVS,"The acting was good, the songs were great, and the story....well honestly it's heart breaking. I felt so sad and depressed by the end of this movie but as much as I hate to admit it the love story is addicting and so beautiful it's just too bad it ended the way it did.",1285804800,,269,4.0
2553467,5,B000F6XMVS,"Production quality of Fanaa is very high, with crystal clear cinematography and great sound on home theater. Songs are very good with Des Rangila standing out in this film and from many other films as well.  Des Rangila is a dance somewhat similar to Aaja Nachle but less energetic and more gracefull with more expressive and symbolic hand and arm movements.  This colorful dance is a magnificent piece of work.  All of the music and drum work is very good.

Having read other reviews that talked about a surprise in the middle of the film I tried hard to see it coming.  I did not. My mind was on a totally different track that might have been okay too. However, the final outcome was not just predictable, it was inevitable.

Negative reviewers have a point about the second half of Fanaa. However, there are many sweet moments worth watching in the second half.  Also, there is an almost must see tongue twister song in the second half that is super cute.

One could buy this movie for the music and dancing alone and be satisfied, especially at the price on Amazon.",1284336000,,1069,4.560209424083769

Very cheesy...but in a good way. If you watch this movie...you will cry, you will laugh and you will go like....WTF!! Haha! I enjoyed it so much...I have watched this like 10 times and still don't get bored.",1276128000,,356,4.578125
2553469,5,B000F6XMVS,"I've spent my break catching up with some notable Bollywood movies which I have not had the pleasure of watching despite being recommended by my friends. ""Fanaa"" also appealed to me as it has two of my favorite Bollywood stars, i.e. Kajol (of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge and Kuch Kuch Hota Hai) and Aamir Khan ( Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak, and more  recently, Lagaan).
Kajol plays Zooni Ali Beg, a young Kashmiri Muslim girl who is blind, but is beloved by her parents (dad is played by veteran Indian actor Rishi Kapoor) and friends. Zooni is leaving for the nation's capital, Delhi for a competition, and her parents are predictably concerned about her well-being, yet they feel this is a step she has to take so that she can be more independent. Her mother is also hopeful that Zooni's trip to Delhi will also be fruitful in other ways, i.e. in providing her an opportunity to perhaps experience love.

Well, mom's wishes come true when Zooni meets carefree travel guide Rehan (Aamir Khan) who is basically a playboy, and unapologetic about it. Zooni is drawn to Rehan's free-spiritedness, and begins to fall in love with him, even after being warned off by her friends, and even by Rehan himself. The pair eventually do form a close bond, one which suffers when a tragedy takes place.

The plot does get a bit convoluted in the second half of the story - but not to give too much away, the theme of terrorism and Kashmir's disputed status plays a major role in the second half of the movie, and Zooni, now several years older, finds the past catching up with her. Will Zooni find happiness at last, or is it an illusion, and how well does one really know the person one loves? These are some of the questions explored in the movie, and though I found the resolution a tad underwhelming, it is still a well-made movie.

The songs are poetic and beautiful, and the cinematography is amazing. This can be considered another one of Bollywood's finer epic love stories, bringing to mind movies such as Dil Se (with Shah Rukh Khan and Preity Zinta), Veer-Zaara, Refugee, etc. The lead actors, both extremely experienced and talented are mesmerizing to watch, and their chemistry is altogether credible, making this a fine viewing experience. Recommended!",1272758400,,2248,4.7270408163265305
2553470,5,B000F6XMVS,"Because of their length, Bollywood films almost always have an intermission, and the intermission is usually preceded by a surprising cliffhanger to keep audiences interested in returning for the second half. Introducing a cliffhanger in the middle of a film is extremely effective in bolstering the narrative (many Western films that sag halfway through could use one). Fanaa has one of the best intermission cliffhangers ever--making it difficult to review the film without ruining the surprise. However, you'll find no spoilers here--Fanaa is too good to give it away.

The story begins in Kashmir--a territory disputed by India, Pakistan, and China--and a place as beautiful as it is troubled by periodic war and terrorism. (In fact, the film was shot in wintry, mountainous areas of Poland because of unrest in the region.) Zooni (Kajol) is a blind, young Kashmiri woman who has been invited, along with her female classmates, to travel to Delhi and perform a song and dance in the capital for Republic Day. Her parents (played by Rishi Kapoor and Kirron Kher) are reluctant to let her go, but they also want to encourage her to be independent so they relent.

Their reservations are warranted, however, because the girls' tour guide in Delhi is a flirtatious rogue named Rehan (Aamir Khan). As soon as Rehan lays eyes on Zooni, he comes on strong and doesn't let up. Even though he's clearly trouble and her friends try to warn her off, Zooni falls for this charmer, partly because she loves all his sweet-talking attention and partly because he doesn't treat her like a child like everyone else does. She may be sweet and innocent, but she's also a capable woman, and Rehan challenges her to think and act for herself.

Fanaa is the first--and to date, only--time the two leads have been paired, and they have a remarkable connection. The initial sparks between their characters turn into fireworks when they end up in bed together the night before she's supposed to return to Kashmir. Of course, as their feelings for each other deepen, Rehan gets scared and tries to push her away, however unsuccessfully. But if you think this is a conventional romance about a man who can't commit, think again. What happens next comes out of left field--and it completely works. The story not only changes direction, it changes genre, but the emotional thread from the first half of the film provides the necessary continuity into the second half, so while the shift is abrupt and unpredictable, it's still congruent and believable.

Fanaa marked Kajol's successful comeback to film after a five-year hiatus (she took time off to start a family). She won her fourth Filmfare Best Actress Award for her performance as Zooni.

2553472,5,B000F6XMVS,"This is another great film to come out of YashRaj studios. Aamir Khan is absolutely wonderful in his dual role of lover and terrorist. The soundtrack is phenomenal and Kajol puts in a stellar performance, as does Ali Haji as their son. The cinematography and story are captivating. This movie is a must-see for those who are Hindi cinema lovers as well as anyone interested in thinking about the complex nature of terrorism. Definitely one of my favourite films.",1268006400,,462,4.860759493670886
2553473,5,B000F6XMVS,"Kajol returns to the shared forefront of Bollywood cinema, as she graces the screen with the ever charming Aamir Khan.  I was beginning to wonder if we were going to see Kajol Devgan return to the Bollywood screen.  Kajol continues to be ever so beautiful with her mesmerizing eyes, creamy soft cheeks, and her kissable, luscious lips.  She is truly a Bollywood beauty.

I enjoy seeing just about any Bollywood film released from Yash Raj.  I know that we are going to get a film of more stringent editing, tighter video screen quality, and overall a higher standard of excellence without shortcuts to ensure a masterpiece once released to the viewing public.  I'm hoping that they will release the latest Yash Raj films (at least those from the past 15 years), to the Blu-Ray format.  So, this way, we fans of our particular favorite stars of Bollywood can be seen in all their glorious beauty, as well as the beauty of the background scenes on India and other various countries that these films are made.

I can't wait to see ""Kuch Kuch Hota Hai"", ""Khabie Khushie Kabhi Gham"", ""Mohabbetein"", ""Kal Ho Naa Ho"", and ""Saathiya"" from Yash Raj. And then some of my other favorite Bollywood films like ""Lagaan"", ""Ghulam"", ""Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai"" and ""Hum Dil Chuke Sanam.""

I already bought ""Veer-Zaara"" which stars my favorite actress Rani Mukerji and other Bollywood favorites such as Shahrukh Khan, Preity Zinta, and Anapam Kher.  This is definitely the latest greatest film released from Yash Raj.  People compared the appeal of this film to ""Fanaa"", but I do believe that ""Veer-Zaara"" is a better film.",1267833600,,1599,4.82051282051282
