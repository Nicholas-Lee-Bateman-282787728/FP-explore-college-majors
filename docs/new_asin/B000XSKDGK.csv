8229400,3,B000XSKDGK,"I use this in my classroom every year. It does a good job of introducing life at that time, periods of Shakespeare's life, the theatre of the time, and a few of the other poets (including the rivalry between the poets). The acting and narration are okay, but not great.  The ""cast"" and ""acting"" are repetitive.  For example, a scene used to illustrate Romeo and Juliet is later used to illustrate Shakespeare and his mistress.  It is good at a high school level to supplement other introductory materials, but it would be too basic for a college level, and it can't stand on its own.  I like this enough to upgrade my VHS (that I have been using for 9 years) to a DVD for my classes.",1294099200,,683,4.354330708661418
