8578815,4,B00C93J732,"If you don't like narration during a movie or find it too distracting, you'll want to forgo The Dead Man and Being Happy. Some narrative turns out to be a little excessive, however, the woman who narrates delivers it matter-of-factly without sounding robotic. Narration aside, another prominent feature that could send moviegoers packing is that its lead character has cancer. Santos, ex-hitman, happens to be cursed not by one or by two, but by three tumors. If you don't mind movies with characters who have tumors, you'll likely be relieved that Santos isn't despairing. Despite the fact that he knows his time is short and continues to deal with debilitating pain (whenever he's not doped up on morphine), he enjoys life as his condition allows. Most of the story takes place on the road in a vintage Ford stationwagon where Santos finds companionship with a stranger and a few adventures along the way. The Dead Man and Being Happy has a realistic-optimistic perspective and contains believable, relatable characters. Jos&eacute; ""Pepe"" Sacristan as Santos is a pleasure to watch.
