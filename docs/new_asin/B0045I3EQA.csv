4262896,5,B0045I3EQA,"I'm biased...and I admit it.  I like Shaun the Sheep. Wallace and Gromit, and the rest of the Nick Park Gang.  The Shaun the Sheep movie is out in theaters and this is a great warm-up for it...or just watch it for fun.  The gags are good.  The animation is superb (as usual).  Anyone of any age can enjoy these 3 shorts.",1440201600,,320,4.096774193548387

8416713,3,B0045I3EQA,"This is a double-sided DVD. Each side contains 6 ""episodes"" from the Shaun the Sheep series. Having seen and enjoyed several ""Wallace and Grommit"" episodes ... and the ""Chicken Run"" feature length movie, I was looking forward to Shaun the Sheep. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed. While cute and pleasurable, the episodes where not particularly sophisticated -- probably a good choice for family viewing with small children -- but lacking the subtle adult-level situations in the Wallace and Grommit episodes. There are a large number of videos with Shaun the Sheep ... but it is unlikely that I'll be adding any more to my collection of videos.",1486080000,,651,5.037037037037037
8416714,5,B0045I3EQA,"My family was introduced to Shaun through another show, and after we saw a few episodes we were all hooked. We now have the entire collection, and regularly share laughs together watching it. There is plenty of quirky humor to keep both kids and adults entertained, and personally I've always been a fan of gumby and other clay animation sitcoms.",1479427200,,346,4.783333333333333

8416716,5,B0045I3EQA,Always good.  In fact I will watch an episode or two before bedtime...It is so funny it puts you in a good mood and assures a good night's sleep. No matter which DVD you buy they are all cute and funny...It is not only for kids...,1471046400,,230,4.0
