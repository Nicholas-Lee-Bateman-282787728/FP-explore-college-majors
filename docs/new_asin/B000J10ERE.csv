The exchange program applies only to purchases of the Superman III Deluxe Edition in the Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition and to disc one of Superman: The Movie Four Disc Special Edition, available as a single title, as well as in The Christopher Reeve Superman Collection and in the Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition.""

PS: With all the Editions shipping today  you really needed a score card.
The details for what should have been in this one are now on the page. Unless you want HD or Blu-Ray Editions of anything in this set,Supergirl and /or The Serials title are the only ones you would need to order separately.",1159660800,11,1225,5.0495049504950495
2664744,5,B000J10ERE,"Where do I begin as this set has it all. It has the four disc edition of Superman the Movie which includes the orriginal theatrical edition plus the 2001 directors cut and two discs of behind the scenes. It has Richard Lesters Superman 2 and Richard Donners never before seen version of Superman 2 which for those who don't know Superman 1 and 2 were made concurently and 70% through Superman 2 ""creative"" differences forced Donner to leave. This version is Superman 2 as it was meant to be seen and don't beleive the very little negative hype as this will be a great movie and an excellent lead in to Superman returns. This set also has Deluxe editions of Superman III which I happen to like and thin it is a nice humorous and dark edition to the Superman Franchise, and this is a 2 disc set and includes never before scene fotage and behind the scenes. It has Superman IV the Quest for Peace Deluxe editon which also has behind the scenes and additional scenes. In my opinion a pinacle to this set is the new Bryan Singer's Superman Returns and is the 2 disc edition packed with special features. This new movie has recieved some bad hype but a majority of good critical reviews and fan reviews. Don't believe any bad hype as it is an excellent movie and a great sequal to Superman 2 and I should not Singer created this movie with Donners vision in min d so the sequal is created through the Donner cut of Superman 2. In my humble opinion Superman Returns has succesfully recreated the Franchise. Now if all this is not enough there is also 16 I think of Max Fletchers Superman cartoons and Bryan Singers video diaries including 2 never before seen. This is a great set and an awesome buy. DO NOT MISS OUT IF YOU ARE A SUPERMAN FAN!",1159660800,10,1735,4.391304347826087

To top it all off, It has Superman IV: The Quest For Peace with never-before-seen footage, commentaries, behind-the-scenes, all of the Fleischer cartoons digitally restored to the highest quality, and the 1951 George Reeves Movie Superman and The Mole Men?...

This was a replacement for one I already had that had damaged disc's so some I can just swap out with my older set, I'll have to rebuy Superman 2 though. Looking at the forums here on Amazon, I am not the only one who has had the exact problem.

Discs were, first of all, all out of order. At least half were either scratched or scuffed, and two were cloudy & hazy over half their surface, like some sort of adhesive or something had adhered to them at some point. Did not bother even putting any into my players to see if worked, immediately boxed them back up and contacted Amazon for a refund.

Several people (including me) have received multiple defective discs.  Indeed, the very first disc (containing the 1978 theatrical cut of Superman: The Movie) is wholly unplayable. Not only that, but it is clear why it is unplayable.  It is completely scratched up on the underside. In my set, Superman II (the original theatrical) is also unplayable, as is Superman Returns. While I could play the Director's Cut and Donner Cut of Superman and Superman II, respectively, I would like to enjoy the original theatrical versions, as well.

If you do plan on ordering the set, don't wait too long to check out each and every disc like I did. I waited too long and now I cannot return the set. I can't even imagine what they did in producing or packaging these discs that would cause so much damage, but I would seek out a different DVD set for Superman movies if you're contemplating this one.",1425772800,2,1059,4.647058823529412

2664789,5,B000J10ERE,"Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition consists of the following films.

1. Superman: The Movie is the best movie about the caped crusader hero. It combines drama,humor,tension and suspense in one complete package. Aside from that,the casting was perfect from Marlon Brando as Jor-El,Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor,Margot Kidder as Lois Lane and of course,Christopher Reeve ,who turned out an iconic performance as the both the bumbling Clark Kent and the hero,Superman. Aside from the adventures of the superhero,it also gives us an idea of his character,humanity and his vulnerability. In summary,this movie is a timeless delight.

2. Superman II:The Richard Donner Cut would have been an epic if it was completed. After viewing this film,it was definitely a lot better and more dramatic than that was released theatrically back in 1980. Lois Lane was more clever in catching that Clark Kent is Superman. Marlon Brando's presence elevated the film into new heights. Aside from that,there was less comical scenes which turned the original Superman II some sort of a slapstick comedy. Also,the existence of the Supervillains were fully explained as well. With regards to the actors involved,we can see that they are more energized with Donner than with Lester especially those who did re- shoots like Reeve,Kidder and Stamp. Finally,the plot was less predictable and clichd as compared to Lester's theatrical version. Overall,it would have been the better movie had it been completed that would probably hold a candle to the first Superman movie and I give this one a perfect rating inspite of its not being finished as well.

3. Superman III turned into becoming a different film compared to Superman:The Movie and Superman II:The Richard Donner's Cut for it became a comedic film especially with Richard Pryor's presence. Aside from that,Vaughn's villainous portrayal of Ross Webster was an uninspired fill-in for Lex Luthor or the Supervillains. Of course,the big blame goes for Richard Lester,a director who more into comedy rather adventure films like Superman. It would have been better that they have retained Richard Donner for the Superman franchise,who could have done a better job with it. Added to that,the absence of Gene Hackman and the near-absence of Margot Kidder,who was limited to 5 minutes of screen time by Salkinds for expressing her disgust on the firing of Donner,proved disastrous to the film. Obviously,the love story between Lana Lang and Clark Kent isn't as interesting as compared to Lois Lane and Superman/Clark Kent after what they have gone through in the first two films. The only good thing about it is the performance of Christopher Reeve,who proved himself to be have great acting skills when portraying the good and evil Superman. Overall,if you are looking for some laughs,the Superman III is the film to watch!!!

4. Superman IV:The Quest For Peace is the least interesting of the four Superman movies done by Christopher Reeve. If the first two films were a classic and Superman III was entertaining enough for good laughs,the fourth film was definitely horrible. The performances of the cast were simply decent. Christopher Reeve does not look to be in top shape as the Man of Steel and he looks tired as Superman and Clark Kent,who was relegated from a bumbling man to a dork in this film. Aside from that,the other cast like Hackman and Kidder look uninspired in their portrayal as Lex Luthor and Lois Lane respectively. The others gave average performances. As for the story,the movie was definitely predictable from beginning to end. Nuclear Man was simply a horrible villain and the least interesting as compared to the Supervillains,the evil Superman and even Gus Gorman. In summary,the action is boring. The special effects look cheaper. And most of all,nobody appears interested in where the story is going. Sidney J. Furie's direction simply is lackluster. It was in the least interesting among all the films that has been shown including Superman Returns.

5. Superman Returns reintroduces the viewer to the superhero. The film does great job in doing that. At the same time,we get to go back Superman:The Movie and Superman II,two great films,from which the story updates us from and neglect the other two films - Supermans III and IV - two poorly made films. The use of special effects were wonderful as well. It makes us appreciate the powers of Superman as they look very realistic as possible. The story was not as good as the first two Superman but nevertheless it wasn't as bad as the last two sequels so it was still worth the view.

There is definitely no other great Superman collection that this set as it consist of the best Superman films ever released on cinema. Every Superman fan would surely be delighted to own it.",1414108800,,4778,5.064803049555273

As for the set itself, ""marvelous"" does not do it justice.  Whoever designed this thought of everything, right down to inserting a strip of foam to keep the fourteen (count them...14) discs full of superb contents from rattling around and potencially being damaged.  The case has a great design and a safe place to keep every disc.  As for the set's contents, everything from the aforementioned products is included plus so much more.  I haven't even gone through all of it yet and I'm already very happy.  Just wait for the right price like I did and you'll be just as happy.

Disc 2 would play for about 45 minutes and then give errors, while Disc 3 is completely unplayable or unrecognnizable.  I haven't checked all the discs yet, but like you can tell I'm quite upset.

2664824,4,B000J10ERE,"This truly is the ultimate collection of  the Superman movies, Christopher Reeve and Brandon Routh.  The first two Superman movies have special versions created by the original director Richard Donner and are the editions to watch, forget the theatrical editions.  The rest of the movies (Superman III, Superman IV and Superman Returns) fail to capture the sheer joy of the original two movies, but are watchable.  The extras, scattered on various DVDs of this 14 DVD collection are a wealth of information on the making of the movies, along with two DVDs detailing the evolution of Superman from comics to the silver screen.  The 14th DVD, Bryan Singer's Video Journals, will only be of interest to fans of the director, I'm not one.

Warner once again puts a collection into one of the worst storage cases, cheap plastic that makes it hard to remove a DVD without a lot of flexing of the DVD.",1390348800,,894,4.7727272727272725

2664846,5,B000J10ERE,"First off, I had a strange issue with a discover gift card during the transaction but it magically solved itself so it wasn't too much of a problem. The price I paid for this box set was an amazing deal.
It shipped rather quickly because it only came from a few states away. The Packaging wasn't a box surprisingly, it was one of those bubble wrap lined envelopes.
When I received it the discs were all out order, which is strange because I bought it new, but I blame the company who manufactured it. Also the regular version of Superman II wouldn't play for some reason. I popped it in and pressed play and it stopped playing the background music and wouldn't play. yet again, this isn't a problem, I prefer the Richard Donner cut a lot more (which Played Fine.) The only other technical problem I had was with Superman Returns, It froze several times during one scene that I can't remember too much because the movie bored me...
Now let's briefly take a look at the movies themselves.

Superman: The Movie- This Movie is a classic that made audiences believe a man could fly. Definitely a movie everyone should see!
Superman II (Richard Donner Cut)- This movie is a great sequel to a great movie.
Superman III- Some scenes are okay, but some are just awkward and weird.
Superman IV: The Quest for Peace: Really Bad. Just something to make fun of with a few good friends.
Superman Returns: Very confusing. Not in terms of the plot, but in continuity. Is it a sequel to the other movies or a reboot? There are scenes that copy the original Superman movie but there are also scenes that reference it too like when they use Marlin Brando's Jor-El Speech from the first movie. And for some reason (If it is a sequel) Superman and Lois Lane look like they've gone from late 20's early 30's to their teen years again. Also it uses the classic John Williams theme and mimics the same title sequences.
All in all you get 14 discs of Superman. Honestly I'm very Impressed with it even if Brandon Routh is on it.",1389744000,,2003,4.472677595628415

2664870,5,B000J10ERE,"The Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition contains 14 DVDs smothered with extras. For information on BR please skip to the last paragraph. There are over 20 hours of bonus features along with 3 bonus discs. If you are having a hard time believing the first five Superman films could deserve 14 DVDs then read on. This box set is nearly perfect. It's every Superman fan's dream. There are a few versions of the Superman film franchise available but this set remains the best to date. Overall, the franchise gets the deluxe treatment with over 20 hours of bonus features (though Superman III and IV get modest extras). The films included:

Superman [4-Disc SE]
Superman II [2-Disc SE]
Superman II: Richard Donner Cut
Superman III
Superman IV: The Quest for Peace
Superman Returns [2-Disc SE]
3 Bonus Discs of Extras

Superman: The Movie is an absolute classic. At least three documentaries on the original film are included: Taking Flight: The Development of Superman, Making Superman: Filming the Legend, The Magic Behind the Cape. The best version of Superman II is the Richard Donner cut (with extra scenes) but the original theatrical release is also included. Director Richard Lester replacing Donner was seen to be responsible for the declining profits and appeal of the franchise. The cast is mostly identical in Superman I-IV (Christopher Reeve stars in them all). Superman III and IV haven't aged well nor do they contain many extras. Superman III is a comedy with Richard Pryor. Superman IV was co-written by Reeve but is probably the weakest of the original quadrilogy. The theme, story, dialogue (""Where is the Woman?""), special effects and budget aren't very good. Gene Hackman's voice dubbed over Nuclear Man didn't help much either. Overall, I would say Superman Returns is the worst. It looks great visually but doesn't work for me on any other level (though Routh is good).

My only complaint is that one of the cuts of Superman does not contain the 1978 Dolby 2.0 version nor does Superman III or IV have any special features (you will have to buy the BR anthology or deluxe DVDs for commentaries and deleted scenes though uncut versions are still not available). Since no box set is perfect I would still rate it 5 stars. Content-wise it is pretty impressive (worthy of a super hero). If you can live with those minor issues the collection is worth owning. Check for the version you want before you buy.

Buy this Ultimate Collector's Edition or Superman Anthology on BR. The BR does add the Science of Superman documentary. Do your own research if you want BR because some releases have more extras and others have less than this DVD set. I could not believe how much stuff is in here (it's mind blowing). Out of all film franchise box sets I have reviewed (Star Wars, Back to the Future, Robocop, and others) this is one of the most complete, deluxe and best overall. I spent over $100 for my copy and I definitely got my money's worth. To this day I'm sure there are things I haven't watched because it's so stocked up (though each film does not get equal treatment). Hunt down an old copy of this collection if you must. The Superman film canon is complete except for Supergirl (sold separately) and the recent release of Man of Steel (soon to be sold separately). Superman gets the deluxe treatment and this release has seen its value increase.",1376697600,,3366,4.788296041308089

2664892,4,B000J10ERE,"I really enjoyed this set and appreciated the work that went into the collection of DVDs.  The first two movies were better than they I remember and the Richard Donner version of Superman II was a true discovery.  The documentaries were wonderfully made and very enlightening.  The set contains the first movie which is really like half a movie, telling the tale of Superman from infancy to a missile attack on California by Lex Luthor.  Christopher Reeve is a wonderful choice as Superman and Margot Kidder as Lois Lane.  That was a lynchpin of the films, the two characters and the actors who played them.  The only interest in the crime fighting is the interesting characters played by Gene Hackman, Valerie Perrine, and Ned Beatty.  In the newsroom, the film had Jackie Cooper and Marc McClure.  Very visually interesting and vocally as well.  This makes the film follow the comic book setting with the bright colors of yellow, blue and red.  The special effects are good and visually interesting and done well but they are not the pleasure, the characters are, even if they represent a comic book.  There are the Max Fleischer cartoons included on a extra disk and commentary by Richard Donner and Tom Mankiewicz for the Superman film as well as Ilya Salkind and Pierre Spengler, the producers of the film.  There is sadness on the commentaries due to Christopher Reeve's injury (he is still alive when this DVD was made) and with the disagreement between Salkind and Donner.  While half the 2nd film was finished when the first movie wrapped, Salkind hired his friend Richard Lester to be the director, throwing off the film and vision of the film.  Salkind insists that there was nothing mean about switching directors and nothing personal and justifies that Superman II was well liked.  There is documentary about Superman made for the DVD and is very good, in addition, the disk contains a Making of documentary made at the time of the movie, 1978.
The second film is in two versions, one the Richard Lester version and the other, the Richard Donner version.  They are both good but the Lester version is smaller and overlooks Superman's comic book lore at times.  The Donner version was intended to in 70mm film just as the first film was, the Lester film is grainier and has less scope.  To get the Donner version there is some of the Lester version in the film and some scenes are actually screen tests done before the film started.  I liked the Donner version best and I'm not sure why the Salkinds did what they did but the way they conducted themselves later shows that they weren't the best producers.  Supergirl is another movie they did.  The Fleischer cartoons continue and the commentary is great.
The third film is a big disappointment and continued the Salkind/Superman slide.  Hearing the Richard Pryor wanted to be in a Superman movie on the Tonight Show, the producers proceeded to create a Superman movie around him without regard the character, comic book or fans.  Lois Lane was dropped except for a brief showing leading fans to believe she'd be back for another Superman and Lana Lang arrived.  While the story is so bad for the Smallville story, it is so disappointing to have Lois Lane missing that it doesn't matter.  There is also a good Superman/bad Superman episode right out of a TV show to keep interest.  The movie is really a loud Richard Pryor movie with a little bit of Superman.  Salkind says it was never intended to be more than an ""mid-season"" episode like you would have on TV.
Superman IV: The Quest for Peace was made by a low budget film company and the special effects are exactly like the B movie movie industry.  Not interesting and silly, but for me, the reuniting of Superman and Lois Lane made the movie better and more important than Superman III.  It also has Mariel Hemingway in a nice spot as a love interest for Clark Kent and Jackie Cooper gets more exposure.  So despite the ""action"" I liked some parts of the film.  The commentary is very nice for the film too, explaining the difficulties in making the film with a B movie company.
The fifth film is Superman Returns which was made in 2006 and directed by Bryan Singer.  He apparently got approval after turning in a proposal that Warner Bros. liked.  I liked some of the ideas too, but this is definitely the worst of the Superman movies.  I don't even remember the name of the Superman actor's name and he doesn't stand out at all in the movie.  The colors are dark and oppressive, the emphasis is on special effects and the Lois Lane chosen is so unLois I'm not sure what they were thinking of.  After watching the movie and the commentary, I watched a documentary of the Making of Superman Returns which turned out to be 3 hours long!  The whole documentary was about Bryan Singer and the Superman actor was seen in the background like a puppet doing what Bryan said.  Bryan tends to hang out with the guys and women are ""so extra"" in this movie.  They barely exist, actually very few people exist except for Bryan Singer and the others are all in his service any way.  Awful.  There is another DvD that is called Bryan Singer's Diary where he created a video diary of his daily life on the set.  One worker stands next to him in one scene and says that Bryan is the greatest director of all time and he is always right and we are always wrong.  Terrible.
A documentary on Superman from his inception in the minds of two high school boys to comic books, radio, film and TV is a great documentary, I highly recommend.  It is narrated by Kevin Spacey and very well done.
So with all that I loved this box set and its' contents were valuable to me except for the 2006 movie which was a revelation in itself without being good.  Still I love Superman!",1363824000,3,5766,4.593352883675465

2664941,5,B000J10ERE,"Superman has been an essential part of american culture for almost three-quarters of a century. Created by Cleveland Teenagers Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in the mid 1930's,the character debuted for the entire world in 1938's ACTION COMICS # 1 and ever since he has been fighting for truth,justice and the American way. Thousands of comic books,A long running newspaper strip,four successful live action TV series (one of which is going into it's 10th and final season now),several animated series...the Man of Steel has done it all.

However, Superman has never flown higher than at the cinemas. From 1978-2006, The world's greatest Superhero (and his cast) starred in six feature length films,four starring the Late Christopher Reeve in the tittle role, setting the stage for such modern blockbusters such as the Iron Man,X-Men,Spiderman and Batman films, and making the world believe a man can fly.

This 14 disc set collects Five of those six films in their original versions (Superman:The Movie, Superman II, Superman III, Superman IV: The Quest For Peace, and 2006's final entry, Superman Returns,with Brandon Routh as a very good Superman) as well as alternate cuts of both Superman:The Movie and Superman II, The entire run of the 1940's Fleisher Superman animated shorts, The 1951 theatrical pilot for ""The Adventures of Superman"" TV show that starred George Reeves, Vintage TV specials, documentaries,deleted scenes, and much much more.

I am a huge fan of Superman, particularly of the movies. To me,both Superman:The Movie and Superman II are the finest films ever made of the superhero genre. Christopher Reeve so embodied what Superman would look like,sound like and act like, you forget that Superman isn't real. He makes you believe in the character,and that quality in his performance carried over even in the later two medeocre entries. While Superman III and IV were subpar films overall, Chris Reeve was still remarkable,and still made them worth watching. Superman Returns, in my opinion, was a very good effort with beautiful visuals and a very emotional story. Brandon Routh proved to be a good choice, and Kevin Spacey was a great Lex Luthor,but ultimately it wasn't the movie fans like myself wanted to see. It failed to capture the magical quality of the original two films.

The presentation and extras are a treat, and  round out the set very well. My only quibble is that they didn't include ""Supergirl"" in the set. True, it's not a Superman film technically, but it is a direct spin-off of the Reeve films.
Also, I have to admit my boyhood crush on Helen Slater (the actress who played Supergirl),but we won't go further than that!

While the hefty pricetag may still scare some, If your a fan of Superman,this is THE set to have.",1286841600,,2761,5.0174672489082965

I AM SOOOO CONFUUUUUUUSED! Amazon lists a 2006 release claiming to have all the same numbers of discs and features as this 2007 set. I suspect Amazon as usual is mistaken. That's why I opted for this instead. Personally I think in a set like this less would have been more. I would have liked this set more if it had less discs. And the less discs I refer to are SUPERMAN RETURNS and any subsequent discs thereof and relating to. Why did they have to contaminate this set with that lousy movie? And to add insult to injury they include a three hour documentary plus other features. As if that's going to convince me Superman Returns doesn't suck. Well it does suck. And no amount of bonus features is going to make me think otherwise. Superman The Movie: Great,  Superman II: Awesome. Superman II the Donner cut: Interesting,  Supermann III: Has it's moments, Superman IV: Weakly executed good idea. Or strongly executed bad idea. Superman Returns: PPPPPPHHHHHHHHRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTT! I don't know how to spell a 5 second long sustained rasberry, but you get the point.",1286150400,,1233,4.730232558139535

But I share my chagrin with others on how thoughtless the packing is. If for instance you own the King Kong (1933) 2-disc collector's set, in a tin case (and by the way also a Warner's release), you can see that it was put in a case that is substantial enough to protect the discs and not get dented. Alas this is not the case with the Supe set. Had Warner's used the same thickness of a case as they did with the Kong set, we would hardly hear a peep from collectors, who rightly protest the short-sightedness of an otherwise superb value. So my bitching is selective, not general by any means.
  In addition, the snafu with the wrong Supe III, i.e., absence of the bonus material disc, and the absence of the 5.1 audio mix of the original theatrical version of Supe I is regrettable. But kudos to Warners for offering the Chris Reeve films, as well as the respectible Supe Returns in the set.",1268611200,,1044,4.404145077720207

One: the lack of a Superman III special edition disc.  Fortunately, I also bought a single disc of this so that I could put it into the set that I have, and, since I bought them both at used prices, it was much cheaper to go this way.
Second, I had hoped that the serials would be included.  After all, they were part of the movies too, even if it was in the late 40's to 50's.
Third, the Superman II Donner Cut.  Why use the turn around the world again?  Couldn't they have come up with something different to end the film?  I would have preferred the kiss.
Fourth, where was the Adventures of Superboy pilot?  It would have been better to see than Superpup.

I was never THAT big into Superman before the show, but I still thought he was pretty cool.  Over the past 8 years that Smallville's been on, my love for the character has continuously grown.  When I stumbled upon this set on Amazon, I absolutely knew I had to have it.  With a price tag of $76.99 spanning over the entire movie saga, I was in awe.  Considering I have a 10 month old daughter, the price tag was a bit too high for my range currently, so I looked through the used and new sales and found this for $25, in perfect condition.
  Now, when I had already purchased this, I obviously overlooked the fact that this was a 14 disc set.  I thought the set included just the special editions of all 5 movies.  I had no idea that both versions of Superman I and II were included.  I also didn't know there was a comic book included as well.  No one could ask for a better deal.
  I must also add that I've never seen any of the old Superman movies, thus why I'm not reviewing each movie, as most people do in their reviews.  I've only seen Superman returns, so this is seriously a huge deal to me.  As big of a Superman fan as I've become, lately, I know I will absolutely love the old films.
  If you are even the slightest fan of Superman, I highly recommend this set to anyone.  If you can't afford the $76.99 price tag, always check out the used and new section, although, this set is definitely worth the Amazon price listed, considering you're getting 7 movies in one very nice looking metal tin.  Even the slip case inside the tin has one of those ""animated"" pictures of Superman flying upwards, crashing through his own logo.  This is an very well put together set and an excellent purchase, to say the least.  The only thing that would make this set better is if it were as indestructible as the Man of Steel, himself.

Really, the Superman film series has given audiences all that is right and wrong with making a film based on a beloved comic book hero. We begin with the brilliance of Richard Donner's initial vision and move to the director controversies of the second, arguably equally triumphant, film. We actually get two versions of the first two films, including the Richard Donner cut of Superman II that is quite different from the version filmed by Richard Lester after Donner was removed from the project. From there the next two Superman films are, at best, uneven and chaotic and a sad way to end Christopher Reeve's iconic portrayal of the Man of Steel. Superman Returns and Bryan Singer's take on the character is interesting, and while an improvement on the horrid Superman IV that killed the movie franchise of the most popular character in the world for 19 years, it still lacks something in my opinion. There are more featurettes and making of documentaries that will please the casual fan to the most avid Superman afficianado. There are some excellent full-length documentaries on the creation and evolution of Superman and the making of the Superman films, including all the controversy. There is a nearly three-hour documentary on the making of Singer's Superman, and there is a touching portrait of actor Christopher Reeve. There are some vintage TV specials thrown in on the making of the first three films, and there are lots of deleted scenes, which is interesting to watch especially on the bad films. You can also listen to a lot of commentary on the films from writers, producers and directors. My favorite was from Michael Rosenthal, a screenwriter for Superman IV, who fesses up with refreshing candor about what a mess the film turned out to be (contrast this with the producer Ilya Salkind's commentary on Superman III where he spends a great deal of time trying to convince us that the critically panned, modestly profitable film was really a smashing success). There is much more to the set including all the brilliant vintage Superman cartoons from the 1940s, some WB Superman spoof cartoons with Bugs and Daffy, a live action Superman movie serial that preceded the popular 1950s TV show and a rare, and truly awful television pilot of a Superman spoof that featured little people dressed up in dog costumes (I'm not kidding). Somewhere on one of the DVDs somebody says that without the original Superman movie, the fantastic success of all the other comic book movies that has come since, including Batman and the X-Men, wouldn't have been possible.

As great as it was having the extra footage seamlessly integrated back into Superman The Movie, I wasn't happy at all with the all-new 5.1 audio mix (preferring the original theatrical mix instead), while also disappointed that Superman II didn't get any of the special features treatment that Superman The Movie did.

Yes, it does include the highly shaky ""Superman III"" and the universally panned ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,"" but their presence in this collection is not that terrible. At the very least, you can look over the special features that are provided with the movies to see just what they were going for. That lets you understand better how they went wrong.

It's telling, however, that the first movie gets 4 discs (which includes both the theatrical and extended cuts of the movie), the second movie gets 2 discs, the Richard Donner cut of Superman II gets 2 discs, there are 2 discs for Superman returns, 2 discs devoted to the history of Superman from inception to now, and 1 disc each for both Superman III and Superman IV.

In the end, this is a 14 disc set that holds 5 movies. 7 movies if you include ""Superman the Extended Cut"" and ""Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut"" as separate movies. That means that you get over 7 discs devoted to behind-the-scenes action and the history of Superman himself.

2665008,5,B000J10ERE,"The name Reeves will forever be associated with the character of Superman. Strange enough there are two men with the last name Reeves that will forever be associated with the character of Superman. George Reeves made Superman a house hold name during the classic TV series 'The Adventures of Superman' and Christopher Reeves for bringing the ""Man Of Steel"" to the big screen.

The expanded version of the first film is interesting for it has a many added scenes, one with Superman and his father in the 'Fortress Of Solitude' which IMHO could have replaced a few minutes of Superman and Lois flying around. The other significant scene involves Superman entering Lex's hideout and Lex testing Superman's vulnerability, which I agree is not necessary. Lex has set the trap......just let him walk into it. This box set devotes 4 disc to the first movie with some excellent material old and new. I also liked that they included some vintage Superman as well(vintage cartoons & Superman & the Mole Men).

Superman II has 3 discs devoted to the film. One disc for the theatrical release with some extra material, another disc for the very interesting ""Donner"" cut of the film and a third disc for some excellent features. I would have to say I prefer the theatrical release of the film only because it is a truely finished product. I do believe if Donner had completed the film his would be better!.....it's really worth checking out.

I will be reviewing each film on their individual releases as I watch them from this set. I have scanned through each of the 14 discs in this set and it's an amazing collection with crisp DVD transfers and a plethora of extra material. If you are a fan of this classic super hero then this is a must buy set!

Anyway-back to the collection at hand.  This collection gives you a sprinkling of just about everything a superman fan could want. All 4 original superman movies with Reeve and the Superman Returns movie with the new guy(sadly not Tom Welling) can be found here. It also includes the Richard Donner Director's cut of Superman 2 which is where this series went wrong in the first place.  Because of problems between the director and producers, Richard Donner was replaced with another director halfway through superman 2 and thus the original theatrical version of that movie sufered greatly.  Watch Donner's cut and you will quickly see that if he had been allowed to continue directing this series of movies the last 2 movies would have looked more like Lethal Weapon 3 and 4(also by Donner) rather than the travesties they are.  Don't get me wrong, superman 3 and 4 have their moments, but they are few and far between.  In any case, there are loads of special features including all of the Max Fleisher superman cartoons, the George Reeves superman movie, deleted scenes, screen tests, and more.",1204675200,2,1304,4.803571428571429

I have never sit down and watch the Special Features (except for Deleted Scenes) in any DVD that I buy, but this collection is the exception. The moment it arrives to your hands and watch the 1st disc, you can't stop, it makes you wanting to watch more, once you have finished to see the 14 discs you want to start over again, I know it sounds obsesive, or something that only a nerd would do, but it's the true. Many people can say that Superman is no longer the best adaptation of a comic in the silver screen, but they forget that Superman came out before there were Super computers for the special effects, when you are watching Superman you really believe that a man can fly, but when you watch Spiderman (for example) you don't believe that there is a man jumping and bouncing and swinging becuase you can tell from a mile away that it is CGI, but still Spiderman is one of the best adaptations ever made. You need to remenber that Superman was the 1st comic book superhero, was the 1st adaptation to radio, tv and movie theater, it gave the standard for all movies made from comics.

2665034,4,B000J10ERE,"Like some of the other reviewers, I purchased a defective disc as well, but with a little bit of patience and waiting, WB was kind enough to replace the damaged pieces.

Credit has to be given for what all this set contains: The four Christopher Reeve films, the Richard Donner Superman II, all the fourties animated cartoons, the Superman Fifitieth Anniversary special, the Bryan Singer documentary, Superman Returns, various interviews and clips.

The deleted scenes were fun. In particular the ones with Gene Hackman from Superman II and IV. His presence really adds to whatever film he's in.

One underrated moment in Superman IV is outstanding moment between Christopher Reeve and Muriel Hemmingway. Yeah! Clark Kent finally gets the girl on his own.

The one omission in my opinion is from Superman 1, and was shown when the movie first premiered on ABC in the early eighties. Then, the network added about fourty to fifty minutes to make the telecast a two night event. We see some of these added moments as extras, but still one missing segment was the final fate of the Kryptonian enforcer who was sent to arrest Jor-El as the planet was beginning to explode. While it was nice to see that ever so quick moment, we don't get the extra where the enforcer is killed on the way to take Jor-El, as a piece of exploding something crashes unto him, and we see his eyes open up briefly in fear.

The scene is only two seconds long, but I wish it had been included in this set. I was hoping it would be included when Donner releases his first Superman 1 deluxe edition on DVD years ago---well, it was not to be.

One does gain an idea where the Superman franchise went wrong in Superman IV. In particular..when observing the actor who was the first Nuclear Man. What were they thinking?

Still. A beautiful package, and maybe WB should release this set again for Christmas 2007 for those who missed it the first time.

How could Warner Bros. mess this up so badly? It's Superman for crying out loud!! He is one of their flagship franchises! I have hundreds of DVDs and have never experienced this much difficulty in finding a quality copy of a boxed set. I will think long and hard before buying any more DVD sets from  Warner Bros.",1181001600,17,930,4.664634146341464
2665043,5,B000J10ERE,"This is a gold mine for all Superman fans everywhere. Despite the problems this set has been plagued with, it was well worth the wait. Yes, $75 is a bit painful, but think about it this way, you're only paying a little over $5 each per single disc. You won't get a deal like that anywhere.

And the content is top-notch. Reacquaint yourself with a young Christopher Reeve in his heyday, as he bumbles as Clark Kent, yet soars as The Man Of Steel. I had almost forgotten just how iconic these films were. My brother and I saw the first movie waaaaaay back in 1978 (that tells you how old I am), and needless to say, it left an indelible impression on us. But it's only now where I can appreciate it on a different level. Like George Reeves before him, Christopher Reeve had a charm about him which spoke volumes. You couldn't have found a better Superman if you tried (notice the nearly 20-year span in between the two actors). Not just anybody could play this character, but both men ran, I mean, flew away with him, and  defined their careers.

And these films have never looked better. All 17 of the Fleischer brothers cartoons from the early '40's are included within this set, and let me tell you, you will cry tears of joy at the beautiful restoration Warner Bros. did on these. (These put the Bosko Video releases to shame. And those were very well done). Other than a few surface scratches, they haven't looked this good since they were originally released. (I'm not THAT old, but I can only imagine the sight of them back then, since they were the first filmed representation of Superman).

I am very well pleased with mine. This whole collection is pure gold. Sadly, for some of this collection's buyers, its become pure Kryptonite. Hopefully everyone will work their problems out, sit back and reconnect with an old friend. You'll forget all about all the money you spent.",1180828800,25,1882,4.559171597633136

I was NOT disappointed!  In fact I love this set so much, I'm planning to buy an extra set here on Amazon just so that I never have to go without!

The packaging is first-class, the tin and lenticular sleeves alone are worth having!  What a beautiful way to display your love for Superman!  The comic book and the free poster offer are great bonuses!  And you cannot possibly beat having FOURTEEN discs of nothing but pure Superman!

From SUPERMAN RETURNS, to the RICHARD DONNER CUT of SUPERMAN II, to the LOOK! UP IN THE SKY documentary ... everything you could possibly want is all here in one SUPER set!

Even though it was a bit of a hassle to have to send in for the replacement discs the first time, it was handled well and I really am pleased with the level of customer service the WB provided for thousands of fans who called in!  It could not have been easier to get the corrected discs.  You really have to appreciate the WB for not letting this mistake slide by - because not all studios would have gone to the same trouble they did to do right by the fans.

Thanks WB for putting this fantastic collector's set together!  I will treasure it forever!

If you are a Superman fan and for some reason you missed this set the first time around, DON'T pass on it now!  Also, you can't possibly get more of a bargain on all of these films!  Even at $100 it is an absolute STEAL for all of these movies, rare special features, and documentaries!  This was the best purchase I've made in a long time!  :)",1180483200,4,1665,4.26517571884984

I really don't mind the minor setback on Superman III's sounds and Special Features issues, as the movie is not really that well made and interesting. Unfortunately it is, and will always be, a part of any true Superman movie collector or fan's movie library. All in all, it is a great collection to have, and it is still cheaper to buy it this way than to buy the movies separately, plus you won't get the extra goodies included in this special collection. I ordered mine last November even before it was officially out, and I have no regrets with it so far.

2665050,4,B000J10ERE,"I was one of (many) people who purchased this ""Ultimate Collector's Edition"" when it was first released, just before Christmas last year. I was also one of the (many) people who had issues with their product - in my case, the Superman: The Movie Director's Cut disc froze halfway through the film and wouldn't play. I had to send three e-mails and call two different 800 numbers, and every time I got a different ""solution"" to my problem. Nobody I corresponded with seemed particularly interested in fixing my DVD. As it stands now, my issue was never resolved, I'm left with a DVD that won't play (an expensive DVD that won't play, even), and now Amazon recommends the new ""Corrected Edition"" for me.

If you didn't buy this the first time around, and assuming Warner Bros. has actually fixed the many different problems people had with the set originally, then it's a great purchase. It's all the Superman films, and they are all presented better than they've ever been seen before.

However, if you're like me, and got screwed over, this ""Corrected Edition"" will leave a really bitter taste in your mouth. It would have been nice if Warner Brothers could have released a DVD set without flaws originally. It's astounding that a major studio would actually let such a shoddy product hit the shelves, but hey, now they fixed it. Everything's okay I guess, as long as you haven't already the victim of their poor products and horrible customer service.",1178496000,20,1452,4.780876494023905

2665052,3,B000J10ERE,"A lot of people know of the problems with the two disc and the exchange program via Warners, but Warner's stil messed up on replacements!

The original Dolby Stereo (2.0) on the replacement is all wrong.  In Dolby Surround there's suppose to be a front center channel for dialog - if you play this ""corrected"" version in Dobly Pro-logic or Dolby Pro-logic II you'll find that the dialog is in every speaker channel (Front Left, Center, Front RIght and even the surround.  If you have a 6.1 or 7.1 system if get even worse with added echo.  No reviewer has mentioned this except for one, and when a thread was posted on the home theater fourm it was deleted.  Check your disc now  -  make sure your receiver is set to Dolby Pro-logic or Prologic II and go to a quite scene in the film where there is no music or and little sound effects - like the interview between Lois and Superman you will notice the dialog is coming out off all speakers.  Walk around the room to each spaaker and you will see for your self how bad this is.  For those who have this box set with the other SUPERMAN film, just check out SUPERMAN III and SUPERMAN IV which are also in 2.0  you will hear a difference - dialog is plainly in the center channel.  Walk around the room to each speaker and you will see that there is no dialog leakage.  Warner's should fix this problem but it will take you the consumer to complain to them so it is done.  Although the the silver box set is schedule for re-release in May I bet it will have the same ""replacement"" disc that Warners has be sending in the exchange program - which means they are defected.  I know, I went through the exchange program too.  I wrote an article about this on my site.  Warners has not returned one of my calls.  This is wrong that they have a problem and are not correcting it.  I know the film's producer and have interviewd him several times - this is not the way it was intended!",1177286400,,1925,4.2707182320441985

The only thing that disappointed me was the fact that the deleted scene in Superman II was not added in the Donner Cut, like I thought it would be.

2665056,2,B000J10ERE,"There are a bunch of movies here, like 6 of them. Fortunately, each of them has the same quality special effects, acting, and script: lame. I know Superman is supposed to be kitchy, but from time to time, it seems that somebody is trying to break out of the box. It just isn't working, the box seems to be made of Kryptonite, because when they try to break out, it dies.

I wish somebody would approach me to write a Superman script. I wonder if it would turn out just as much of a disaster as those 6 films. I mean, maybe Superman is like ketchup: whenever you pour it on something, it becomes the ketchup. Superman is the kitch ketchup. Anything you do with him turns into kitch.

There was a Supergirl movie a while back, I think. And there was another film where it wasn't Supergirl, I think it was titled: My Girlfriend is a Superhero, with Uma Thurmann. That was pretty good, better than these 6 films combined.

2665057,5,B000J10ERE,"First of all Superman: The Movie. Without a doubt the best superhero movie of all time. When I first saw this movie I was only four years old when my parents took me to see it in Christmas 1978. In my ignorance I was expecting to see George Reeves whose TV show was in reruns at the time. I think as an anticipation for the film I guess. So obviously I was pumped up. When all of a sudden this film exploded in the cinema. It was a true phenomenon. This collection includes the theatrical and extended cut.

 The highlight of this collection is definitely Superman II:The Richard Donner Cut. It is so unbelivable just to imagine what could have been. This movie is far from perfect, but it is enjoyable. If only Donner had the chance to finish it back then, it would have been a masterpiece a la par with Superman: The Movie. For me this is the official sequel to STM. Not that Lester's version was bad, but I always noticed that it lack the magic that the first movie had, and now the Donner Cut continues with that magic. I am so glad to finally see this cut after almost 20 years. Reeve is, as expected, simply amazing. He is Superman to me. Routh did a great jod, but Reeve is the man.  The scenees with Brando are just awesome. Now the story makes sense (father/son relation).

  This collection is only for die-hard fans like me because only fans like me can tolerate a movie like Superman III and SIV which are the worst of the series with SIII being the worst in my honest opinion. The only scenes worth watching are the junker fight between Clark and Superman (which is rated as one of the best Superman fights of the series), and Annete O'Tootle, who looks gorgeous in this film. I didn't even care to send the replacement for this disk. SIV for some unknown reason I always liked ever since I saw it back in 1987. I know it is not perfect. Its one of those movies that people love to hate, but for me it's ok. At least it is more enjoyable than SIII.

  Then we have the return, or should I say the rewrite? With all the similitudes this movie had with STM I can help but think when will CR appear as Superman. I liked it. I liked it alot. I saw it four times at the theater. But I didn't love it. It didn't inspire me the same way STM and CR did back in 1978.

  This collection is loaded with hours of extras so get ready to have a super experience. Overall, this collection is a must have for any Superman collector, or any collector. You won't be disappointed",1175817600,,2474,4.240425531914894

It has all the Superman movies, great special features, commentary, the Dick Donner cut of Superman II (almost how it was truly intended to be filmed as a sequel to Superman: The Movie), a bunch (if not all) of the old cartoons, and one episode of the old superman series. It contains all the history and the reasons why the Superman movies' quality went down hill after the first movie. It also has a free offer for all the movie posters. If you listen to the commentary from the first 4 movies you can hear the directors shooting verbal slugs at each other while explaining their sides and opinions of the whole Superman movie arc.

There is a fix for this via a toll free number in the US which I have tried over here in the UK and racked up a pretty impressive phone bill, And I still don't have the correct discs!

Amazon have however (After much complaing from me) issued me a replacement, Which has never shown up because they have had problems with delivering it to my home address, which is where all my other purchases made around the same time as this one back in October 06 as well as some DVD's I bought and received last month, where sent to!?!

Presently it's the latter. Originally we had thought it was because they were pulling their sets until the replacement disks could be issued.

That appears NOT to be the case. My husband ordered it last week, when it was ""available"" and Amazon was selling it directly. I haven't had the opportunity to check disk 1 yet, but disk 8 is definitely the incorrect version, lacking the special features.

I am aware that WB will correct this, but quite frankly, if I had wanted to go through the hassle of calling and sending back disks, we would have bought the set last November! I see that several customers posting recently have received the sets with all the correct disks, but obviously there are still incorrect sets out there. I fail to understand why Amazon could not have posted a warning that any set purchased at this time could possibly not contain all the disks as advertised.

I bought my set right here on Amazon and I have had no problems whatsoever. (Incidentally, the tin case is awesome - don't understand the complaints about that at all.)

If you are a Superman fan you will LOVE this set. It's not just the recent Christopher Reeve/Bryan Singer movies but an entire Superman Anthology, including content all the way back to the 40's. The Richard Donner cut of Superman II alone is worth getting this set for. How cool is it that Internet fans actually convinced the studio to dig into archive footage and try to recreate Donner's film as it might have been? It's the closest thing we'll ever see. I'm grinning from ear to ear.

I just can't wait to dig into all the material in this set. It's just the thing to make you want to stay home all day on a Saturday in your PJ's. This is the most excited I've been about a DVD release since the Lord of the Rings extended editions.

There is also tons of deleted scenes. I owned the previous set with Superman 1-4 and this set is 1000x better. Not only does the new set have more bonus features but it has more physical stuff as well, including a small comic book. My favorite design feature is when you open the tin, on the front of the DVD sleeve, you get an animated holographic image of Superman flying through the ""S"" symbol. It looks a lot better than the Amazon item photos!

2665100,5,B000J10ERE,"When Superman went into production, it was a year before I was born. I had it on VHS but I always wanted to get it on DVD. Initially I wanted to get the box set that came out sometime ago, but for some reason I hesitated. When Superman Returns came out, I wanted to go see the movie and never did. I just recently saw it now that it's on DVD and I actually liked it. (except for a few exceptions). So I was at Costco a few weeks ago and I saw the Ultimate Collector's Edition. But I had to wait till pay day. Well, I went back last week and it wasn't there, so I started looking at stores and they weren't selling it anymore, so I compared it online and found Amazon being the best priced. I bought it on Friday evening and got it Monday morning. WOW. USPS is NEVER that quick.

I so love the casing. Not the whole package. I would have preferred each dvd in it's own dvd box. But I love the whole thing.

I have the original score on CD from the first movie. I love John Williams' work. I appreciated his work for the final movie.

All the extra's are unbelievable. Things I never knew, forgot, and unseen. Deleted scenes...with IV being the corniest and I can see how they were deleted. Even audition tapes and how Margot Kidder was absolutely the best gal to play Lois Lane. Just incredible history how it all came about.

The extras are great too. Superman cartoons are amazing to watch and I remember seeing a few of them as a child. Those cartoons wouldn't have seen the market now-a-days.

If you are Superman fan, this is a must have. I don't regret getting this and I didn't have any problems with my discs. Well, I have 3 more discs to go through still since I got it Monday and today is Thursday.",1170288000,,1707,4.17629179331307

Through the years and four movies Christopher Reeve has been indelibly linked to the Man of Steel.  Though the sequels did not always live up to the original, each had its own merit.  Now the torch has been passed to another young actor to carry on the legacy of the Last Son of Krypton.  This collection gives us the chance to revisit the movies, to see them anew, and in some cases, to see them as they were meant to be.  It gives us rare glimpses at how the magic was created, at the trials and tribulations of making the seminal superhero movie.  From the Max Fleischer cartoons to George Reeves.  From Christopher Reeve to Brandon Routh.  From Richard Donner to Bryan Singer.

2665105,5,B000J10ERE,"Beautifully packaged, thoughtfully produced, and chock full of goodies, this ""Kriptin"" collection of all four SUPERMAN movies is well worth its full retail price. From Richard Donner's 1978 first film to Bryan Singer's 2006 sequel, audiences are treated to all the soaring heights and disappointing lows of what may very well be the finest superhero series in cinema. The troubled and controversial production itself is chronicled in the ""Behind The Scenes"" supplements, and the stories they tell are utterly fascinating.

Of course, that's not to say that die-hard fans will probably want more than what's offered: Missing is approximately 30 minutes of extended footage of the first Superman movie shown during its original television broadcast, and a few deleted (though much bootlegged) scenes from SUPERMAN II don't appear anywhere on THE RICHARD DONNER CUT or even in the Lester-directed original. The long-missing footage from SUPERMAN IV remains unfinished and incomplete, though admittedly, very little could have been done to save that unfortunate production. I also question the placement of the classic Fleisher cartoons within this set, in lieu of the additional footage, and would love to have seen isolated scores for each sequel, but again, that is all nit-picking.

For those of you who might have missed, or else dismissed, SUPERMAN RETURNS, now is your chance to see what is perhaps the most underrated movie of 2006 (despite it's $200 million dollar domestic gross).  The film is a worthy successor to the Donner films, and resonates with emotion and reverence usually absent in most superhero movies.  Kate Bosworth and Brandon Routh are terrific in the roles of Lois and Clark, and the action is treated with an epic feel harking back to the original.  I didn't know what to make of the film when I first saw it in the theatres, but after viewing it on home video, I appreciate Singer's work and urge naysayers to give it a second look.

For now, it's good to see the SUPERMAN movie series being treated with the same love and respect as any other American classic. Do yourself a favor and buy this set. You'll be watching it long after you've grown tired of all the SPIDER-MAN and FANTASTIC FOUR movies in your super-hero movie collection.",1169424000,3,2262,5.03475935828877

Thankfully, I obtained a version without any of the problems that others have experienced (I have the original Dolby 2.0 mix on Superman: The Movie (disc 1) and Superman III (disc 8) contains the advertised features).

With that out of the way, all I can say is that if you're a Superman fan, this set is truly worth the money.  Having just picked it up, I've only seen Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut and the documentary You Will Believe: The Cinematic Saga of Superman so far.  (Of course, I've seen all of the movies before, but not from this set yet.)

The aforementioned documentary, You Will Believe: The Cinematic Saga of Superman, is a nice introduction to the set.  If you've seen the films, watch that first and you'll be primed and ready to watch the movies in order in one sitting.

The packaging is fantastic.  The tin box the set is packed in is a bit prone to dings, but inside is a marvelous lenticular liner and a nifty plastic album with all 14 DVDs.  The set also includes a comic book (a reprint of a 1987 adventure called Superman: Rampage) and liner notes printed to look like a minature edition of the Daily Planet.

I'm glad I'd held off buying the individual Superman movies on DVD and got this set instead.  Again, if you're a fan of the movies, this is the way to get 'em.  With all of the content, you're getting 6 Superman movies (Superman II and Superman II: The Donner Cut are different enough to be considered different movies), a myriad of Superman cartoons, a 1951 feature with George Reeves, 2 separate Superman documentaries, and loads upon loads of ""Making of"" features, trailers, and more.

Boasting an emotionally wrenching story, Superman IV finally gives us the Reeve/Kidder chemistry we've been waiting for, easily surpassing its predecesors--not only in the previous Superman films, but in all cinema history since the advent of the film camera.  Never has the expression of love, power, and drama been so brilliantly captured upon celluloid as when Superman plugs that volcano with another mountaintop.

Stunning, mindblowing special effects are only one of many highlights!  Be amazed as Superman repairs the Great Wall of China by simply...looking at it!  Incredible!  The battle between Superman and Nuclear Man in Metropolis makes the battle in Superman II look like an Olsen twins catfight.

While Christopher Reeve is great as always, the real star of Superman IV is Marc Pillow as Nuclear Man.  The english language sadly lacks the words adequate to describe the stunningly emotional, nuanced, tour-de-force of acting power Pillow brings to the screen.  Inexplicably passed up for an Oscar, Pillow can take solace in knowing that his glory will shine for all time in this DVD set.  True students of acting will observe the conflicted torment and pain Pillow portrays in Nuclear Man's eyes when he roars and flaps his arms excitedly on Lex Luthor's balconey.  Breathtaking.

So yes, as mindnumbingly dull as the first three movies are, you won't regret buying this set once you pop in the final film.  If nothing else, you could use the first three movies as drink coasters or paperweights.",1168473600,2,1750,5.073426573426573

Disc one is the original theatrical version of Superman: The Movie has two trailers and a TV spot. It also has a terrific audio commentary with Exectutive Producer Ilya Salkind and Producer Pierre Spengler. BEWARE: Ilya Salkind does ramble on about other movies a bit too much.

Disc two is the 2001 Special Edition of Superman: The Movie. It has a commentary by Director Richard Donner and Creative Consultant Tom Mankiewicz. It also features a music only track, so you can watch the whole film with the score and no dialouge.

Disc three contains most of the features that were originally found on side two of the 2001 DVD release of Superman. It includes: three documentaries, 11 minutes worth of restored scenes, three screen tests, and additional music cues.

Disc five is the original Superman II (directed by Richard Lester) with commentary by Ilya Salkind and Pierre Spengler. It also includes a theatrical trailer.

Disc six is the Richard Donner Cut of Superman II. On this disc is a commentary with Donner and Mankiewicz, as well as an introduction by Richard Donner, or Dick as he prefers to be called. Also included is the featurette Superman II: Restoring the Vision. There are also additional scenes.

Disc seven: two vintage TV specials, the new featurette First Flight: The Fleischer Superman Series, and eight Famous Studio Superman cartoons.

Disc eight: Superman III with a vintage TV ""making of"" special, commentary with Ilya Salkind and Pierre Spengler, the theatrical trailer and the Justice League Heroes video game trailer.

Disc nine consists of Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, commentary by Mike Rosenthal, the theatrical trailer, and 20 minutes of deleted scenes.

Disc ten is Superman Returns and is devoid of special features.

Disc elevin is the second disc of the Superman Returns DVD release which contains a seven-part documentary, Requiem for Krypton: Making Superman Returns, 11 deleted scenes, the featurette Resurrecting Jor-El, the teaser and theatrical trailers, and the EA Games Superman Returns trailer.

I am starting to feel this is Warner Brothers atempt to shaft the buying public, for if it isn't surely they would have put in a more efficent system for dealing with this problem, such as allowing replacement submitals online. Outside of this one issue I am very pleased with the collection, despite the ongoing problem with missing features.

(UPDATE)

I just wanted to amend this review to say that I contacted Warner Brothers Via email and was able to get the replacement disc, however I still feel the replacement process could have and should have been more streamlined and efficient.",1168387200,2,1103,4.680412371134021

2665222,5,B000J10ERE,"For the amount of money you would spend on each individual dvd title that all come included in this set; it is a no brainer. This is the best and most affordable way you can spend your money. I bought this set for about $71.00 (usd) but before I did, I had just recently purchased Superman Returns and the new Richard Donner edition dvd. Yet those both ran for $50.00 (usd). So there was no question in my mind that the best bang for my buck was to return those 2 dvds and pick up this ultimate set for an extra 21 dollars plus I would get the 4 original movies with newly added content a bonus dvd i could care less for that shows the history of superman in the media but hey what did i care... all these extras where a mere 21 bucks more :)

So the moral of this story is.....

Buying each superman title individually= roughly $140.00 (usd)assume each title is $20 and the superman returns is 30.00 as it was when I bought it, and that bonus dvd probably retails for like $9.95 somewhere :P",1168300800,2,992,4.18848167539267

I have not done received my new disc back, so this review is incomplete. The number for the replacement discs is 1-800-553-6937.

5 stars would be if they had not screwed up the set in the first place.

  The other discs are great. I loved the Richard Donner cut of Superman II. When you watch it you have to realize that some of the scenes are cut out of the screen tests. They really show how much weight that Christopher Reeve had to put on. Considering what I thought that the movie would look like, its something that all Superman fans should see.

  If you consider that the price of Superman Returns + Richard Donner cut is around 45 dollars, I figured for an extra 25, it would be worth the extra money.",1168300800,3,1013,4.3

2665269,5,B000J10ERE,"I still remember when ""Superman, The Movie"" was released. I was just 13yrs old and it rocked my world. Christopher Reeve was to become one of my darling actors and the sense of magic would stay with me forever. I saw it three times cause I couldn't help it. I collected pictures and albums that got lost throughout the years of constant moving. I was sad, but hopeful that one day things would turn for the better. I spent days and hours flirting with a copy of ""How The Movie Was Made"" which hung at the newsstand on my way to school. But I could not afford it. I remember those days with love because they taught me how to be strong and persistent. And now I am so delighted to own this fabulous collection. I finally got to see what I so long wished for.

The metal box is superb and the art quality is just beautiful. There are two versions of the first film: the theatrical release and the extended version. The documentary about the first Superman Movie is amazing. Presented by Marc McClure - who played Jimmy - it is so detailed that the magic of those years came back to me in a flash. The beauty of the special effects and the creativity and struggle of the artists who didn't have the comfort of computer technology blinds us with so much talent and quality. The film is still a pleasure to watch. ""Superman II"" is also accompanied by a second Disc which contains a behind-the-scenes documentary presented by Richard Lester, who took over the project from Dick Donner. The street fight scene is amazingly elaborated and choreographed and you cannot miss it. A third Disc gives you the Richard Donner's Cut which is so different from Richard Lester's that you have the feeling you're watching a completely new movie. Dick Donner re-edited to the way he had seen it from the start and there are so many new scenes that I was flabbergasted. The story took a totally different turn and I didn't even miss the old one. You get to see  Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder on scenes that were filmed for a screen test. They are so perfect that you don't see any difference. It was like watching Chris freshly back on his feet. And I love the fact that, almost thirty years later Dick Donner got to print his name on the credits. His child was finally flying. Well done!

""Superman III"" disappointed me for one single thing. The promised ""The Making Of"" documentary is not in the box, although it is mentioned on the booklet. I contacted Amazon for the discrepancy but no clear answer was given to me. I still enjoy the movie, although the drop in production quality starts being visible. But it remains a classic. ""Superman IV"" is just the movie and some deleted scenes but I don't understand what is so Deluxe about it. The film was also a flop, but the pleasure of seeing Chris makes it up to you.

The box also contains ""Superman Returns"" from Brian Singer, full of extras and Director's Blogs. He has done a beautiful work and I love the movie. The film intends to be a sequel to all the others but there is something on Richard Donner's Cut version that changes the story a little, making Brian's version get a bit lost. I will not give it away, but if you have the chance to see it, you might understand what I am talking about. Nevertheless, a piece of art to have. Not to mention the other Discs about the story of Superman, plus some cartoons from the 40's. In the end, this Collection is just amazing and any Superman fan would be delighted to own.

Superman the Movie director Richard Donner pulls no punches when he discusses how he was fired from Superman II and watching the Christopher Reeve movies again you can tell the difference between his vision of the character and that of Richard Lester.  A major highlight is the Superman Returns commentary.  You can see and hear Bryan Singer's love for the character and his desire to do justice to such an iconic figure.  All of the documentaries that are included make the viewer realize Superman's importance to not only the comic book work but the world in general.  In a day and age of violent and gritty comic book movie heroes it is good to know that at least one will remain true to the ideal of the superhero, and that one is Superman.",1168300800,2,945,4.622754491017964

2665356,5,B000J10ERE,"Wow. What an amazing collection. This boxed set is clearly THE Ultimate Superman collection. If you are INTERESTED in this collection I won't break down the contents as a part of this review, I don't think that helps the buyer since the info is given in the product information by the folks at Amazon. I will however touch on what left me flat. The Donner Superman 2.

Im not sure what I was expecting, Im just pretty sure this is not it. The problem is the editing is horrible, and the soundtrack seems like cut up bits from John Williams' original score from the 1st film. I recognize that this is simply Donner showing where he would have gone if the film were realized solely by him. Unfortunately, my favorite pieces are already a part of the Richard Lester cut. I found myself missing the scenes with Clark falling in the Niagra River trying to ""save lois"" or that iconic ""transition"" take off scene in the alley. This is following Perry White's monologue about Lois being in Paris with a Hydrogen bomb.

The Donner cut has weird cheesy parts like Zod yelling ""free"" after the Phantom Zone breaks, and the confusing re use of Superman reversing time by circling the earth (why??) The montage intro in the Lester cut is also better, Superman 1 scenes with music instead of dialogue piece meal as in the Donner cut.

I did like the additional Brando footage, and didn't miss Susanne York much at all. I was glad the shrink wrap ""S"" shield was gone from the Fortress of Solitude battle, and the other unmissed parts such as the ""Finger beam"" scenes that I never cared for, and the morphing (a la Nightcrawler minus the 'Bamf')is also gone. All that is appreciated.

However its outweighed by other absenses. Such as when Zod is pulling the gun away from Deputy Dwane like he had magnetic powers. This scene is in both, but my problem here is all the valid funny stuff between the Deputy and the Sheriff, and the exchanges between Non and Zod are all gone, and they are missed. Why did Superman Destroy the Fortress of Solitude??

Anyhow, I loved the rest of the DVD's and enjoyed the countless hours of extras. Obviously Superman one, any version, is AWESOME. The Lester Superman 2, easily in my top 5 Super-Hero movies period!! Superman 3 and 4 have always been forgettable and still are. The look up in the Sky documentary is great, the George Reeves film, the Fleischer toons and so on are all priceless I am very satisfied with all this content. Dont let the weak Donner Superman 2 review affect your decision, just don't make it the reason you buy this set.  Buy it for the rest of the material, and save the Donner Superman for Someone whose never seen the Lester cut, they might like it.",1168214400,2,2697,4.539094650205762
2665357,3,B000J10ERE,"Well, I had read that Warner Brothers had corrected the inferior disc problem in his Ultimate Collector's Edition after the holidays, so I went ahead and ordered mine on January 2nd, 2007.  It arrived in it's beautiful tin box quicker than I expected it to (only 6 days!), but, low and behold, it still still has the no-Dolby-2.0-on-Disc-1 problem and the no-deleted-scenes-or-featurette-on-Disc-8 problem.  :(  Reluctantly, I was forced to call the toll-free WB Replacement Hotline (800 553-6937 for those of you still searching for it).  I spoke to someone, obviously in a foreign country, who, after several corrections on spellings of my name and address (who in America would think it was FranklinG?!), gave me a confirmation number (mine is a series of three 2-digit numbers), and assured me that a pre-paid envelope would be sent out in a few days in which I could return the incorrect discs to have them replaced with the proper ones.  Now, if your not a stickler for audio quality or bonus features, these problems are something you won't even notice, and the inconvenience of having to wait several weeks to get replacement discs is the only thing preventing me from giving this set a higher rating.

  Now, on to the actual product, not its associated problems.  Every Superman movie made to date, including Donner's original vision for II.  You can't really beat that!  Plus deleted scenes, restored scenes, theatrical trailers, 2 documentaries (You Will Believe & Look, Up In The Sky!), Singer's video journals, five ""Making Of ..."" TV specials for the various movies, the George Reeves 1951 feature film Superman and the Mole-Men, 17 of the old Fleischer/Famous Studios cartoons from the 1940's (for ALL of these you'll need to get the 2 WinStar Home Entertainment DVD's), 3 Warner Brothers cartoons with a Superman nod (Super-Rabbit, Snafuperman, and Stupor Duck), a TV pilot for The Adventures of Superpup, a mini-comic of DC's Superman #7 circa 1987, and so much more I can't even begin to get into it here!  The set comes with a mini issue of the Daily Planet to lay out where all these goodies are found on the 14 discs.  And all this in a very nice tin casing that opens front & back, plus an offer for 5 movie posters.  That's 27 hours of Superman and all kinds of extra goodies, kids!

All the disks work fine but one disk is missing extras and another one is missing a sound track.  You would never know these are missing but I was able to find out by going to different Superman fan sites were they were talking about the problems.

Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition costs less then buying each item seperately and includes the following exclusive items...

1. You Will Believe: The Cinematic Saga of Superman

2. Bryan Singer's Journals (Extended Edition)

3. Reproduction of Superman Comic # 7

4. Mail-in offer for 5 Superman Movie Posters

I didn't give it 5 stars for all of reasons that follow...

1. I wish the tin didn't ding or dent so easily.

2. I wish the movies came in something besides just the plastic holders that seem to be cheaply made and it is not very easy to get the discs out.

3. I wish that a new Supergirl (Special 2 Disc Edition) were included in this Ultimate set and included both the Theatrical Cut and the Director's Cut of that film.

4. It would have been awesome to have included the Theatrical Serials too.

5. Even more awesome, but asking too much... Would have been... That they included both the HD and regular DVD versions of this film all in one set!

I realize that all of this would have cost a little more, but it would have been worth it!

I think that they will not only re-release this set in February with the corrected Superman III and Superman - The Movie discs, but that they will someyear soon release this set in HD and/or in BluRay format. It will likely be when they release the followup film to Superman Returns on DVD or when they release the Trilogy of Superman Returns on DVD. By then most people will have either an HD or a BluRay player and an HD TV and this set will be worth the upgrade. Hopefully they will learn from their mistakes this next time around when they do make that HD and/or BluRay set.

My 14 Disc Set was missing the first disc of the Two Disc Theatrical Verion of Superman II and had an extra copy of the third disc for Superman - The Movie.

My 14 Disc Set included the Deluxe Edition of Superman III, but I am not sure how to tell if it included the original theatrical 2.0 track on Superman - The Movie. It shows the 2.0 track on the DVD menu, but from what I read in another's comment on a review here this doesn't mean that it is actually the original theatrical 2.0 track. I realize from what I have read that the original theatrical 2.0 track doesn't have the wooshing sounds that are on the new 5.1 track, but where do I listen for those in the movie and what do they sound like?

I didn't give this a 3 rating, because this Superman Collection still has ""the best bang for my buck"" at this time.

P.S. I too am not looking forward the the long hold time when calling Warner Brothers about my missing disc.",1167264000,,2758,4.376470588235295

And the same features, aside from the DVD-ROM features on the S:TM disc, from 2001 are found here.

The highlight of the set is the new Donner Cut of Superman II.  It's a refreshing look at how Superman II should have been.

Now, as for the problems, WB has been handling the problems with S:TM and SIII quite professionally.  I called the evening I got my set, and exactly one week later, I got my envelopes.  I am looking forward to getting my replacement discs.  Too bad WB doesn't have good quality control, otherwise they would have caught this problem before these discs ever left the factory.  Despite all of this, they are fixing the problems very fast.

All in all, this set will rock your mind, and is worth shelling out money for this set.",1167177600,5,1023,4.627777777777778
2665378,4,B000J10ERE,"First, let me address the issue of the replacement disc process.  I, too, tried to call the 800-number yesterday (12/26) and gave up after holding for about an hour and a half.  Now, I don'tknow if there was a problem with their phones yesterday, or if it was just a bad time to call because everyone who got they're DVDs for Christmas (like me) was trying to call at the same time, but when I called again after work this evening (around 6PM EST) I surprisingly got through after only about 5 minutes.  So, don't be too discouraged.  Granted, it still remains to be seen how long it will take to get my replacement disc.  Incidentally, my set did have the correct version of Superman III, so at least WHV got something right.

Now, onto the set itself.  I haven't watched the whole thing yet (obviously, since I've only had it for two days) but I have watched the discs that are exclusive to this set, and I have to say they're very good.  The ""You Will Believe"" documentary goes from the early days of the making of the first film through Superman IV, and offers some very honest insights into the trials and tribulations encountered along the way.  The inclusion of ""Super-Rabbit,"" ""Snafuperman,"" and ""Stuper-Duck"" as well as the moving tribute to Christopher Reeve are nice touches as well.  Bryan Singer's Video Journals were relatively fun to watch, especially the one where he goes to New Zealand to ""help"" Peter Jackson direct a few scenes in King Kong so Jackson can catch up on his sleep.  (There's another gag later on where the producers try to replace Singer, but it doesn't come off nearly as well.)  The only one of the actual movies I watched so far is the Donner Cut of Superman II, which I have to say, left me a little disappointed.  I was expecting this version to blow Lester's out of the water, but I find myself liking Lester's version better.  Perhaps if Donner had been able to see his original vision through in the first place and come up with a proper ending, it would have been better.

As for the rest of the movies, I've seen them all before and I don't expect my opinions of them to change from watching them again now.  In a nutshell:  Superman I, II, and Returns good; III and IV bad.  'Nuff said?

All said, there is a lot of value in this set for the money, and once the corrected sets start to hit retailers, which I hear should be around mid-January, the headaches should go away.",1167177600,4,2418,4.454545454545454

From the chance that they would be the ""bad"" discs I had called the 800 number sometime early in Dec. or late Nov. They told me about the sleeves and info. they need and all.

So I get the set on X-mas and call the 800 number. I give it an hour on hold before assuming that no one is there to answer the phone EVEN though they kept repeating ""please continue to hold all opperators are still busy assisting other customers"".

I call back today (Dec. 26th) now thinking they will be there. Well from online feedback I've read YES they are there (and were on X-Mas too!) but it is now 4:45pm and I have been on hold since FRIGGIN NOON!!!!

2665386,4,B000J10ERE,"I would call myself a casual fan of Superman.  Enough of a fan to get this set - and I think it was worth it.

The extras on the original Superman series was very cool to see.  Including a lot of back story on how Superman was crated in the 1930s and its various incarnations.  The extras about Superman Returns were not as interesting.  It was too much of just some dude with a camcorder following Bryan Singer around.  Not too exciting nor insightful (Of course, Superman Returns was still a very good movie).  I think the way they do ""behind-the-scenes"" specials today lacks something.  Seeing people just keep saying ""And then to do this cool effect we just programmed it into this computer here"" is not very interesting.  But, for the original Superman series it was cool to see all the things they did to so ""you will believe a man can fly"".  All the interviews and insights into the relationship (or lack thereof) between the director and the producers was interesting.

I never knew Donner filmed both Superman I and II at the same time, yet he was never given the chance to finish the second one.  And therein lies the coolest part of the whole set - The Richard Donner cut of Superman II.  I think his version is much better than the way the movie was released in 1981 under Lester's direction.  It was surprising to see how many scenes Lester reshot.  Donner's cut does a much better job of character development.  Specifically, the relationships between Superman/Clark and Lois, Superman and his Father and even Lex and Miss Tessmocker.  The way in which Superman losses then regains his powers was much more believable, interesting and captivating than in how the other director did it.  Donner also had a much more engaging way in which Lois tests whether or not Clark is Superman.  All in all, Donner did the film in a more serious way than Lester's campy version.  The only thing I thought lacked in Donner's version was the fight scenes between Superman and the 3 baddies (however, I think that was more due to Donner never actually filming those scenes and wanting to use as little of Lester's work as possible).

All in all a neat set that is fun to watch again in full surround sound!",1166400000,4,2204,4.571428571428571
2665387,3,B000J10ERE,"I was highly excited with this this edition of Superman, I thought Warner had finally got their act together and gave us all the films we deserved.  After playing most of the discs, I was dissapointed by a number of issues.  First of all the soundtrack on the original Superman movie doesn't include the 1978 version, this is something we were promised, but instead we get the ridiculous remixed soundtrack that I can't even bear to listen to.  Those extra whoosh sounds do the film no justice whatsoever, the sound remixing team really did a lousy job restoring the audio.  Secondly, just like everyone else I was very excited to see Donnors version of Superman 2, but after watching it, I think I preffered Lesters version.  Maybe if Donnor was allowed to finish the film, it would've been different, but what we have is a blend of scenes that don't go together.  Some of the shots just look awful, and the cgi looks terrible.  Thirdly the issue surrouding Superman 3 hasn't been resolved in this release.  If you want the 2000 dvd edition, wires were visible in Superman 3 which were supposed to be painted out for the dvd.  We were told that this would be fixed for this edition, but when i watched it, its excactly the same as the earlier version and the wires are still visible.  The disc is also missing some deleted scenes.  Fourthly, Superman 4 is also missing some deleted scenes.  I have no arguments over the bonus documentaries, they are all great, but I expected the errors to be fixed on the movies, and so far Warner haven't issued any replacement discs, they are just taking names and addresses.  Very dissapointed indeed!",1166313600,5,1639,4.649305555555555
2665388,1,B000J10ERE,"As has been said, Superman III isn't the proper version!  I don't know who compiled this set, but that's an atrocity for the price I spent good hard-earned money for.

I still haven't gotten the packaging to swap the discs.  Even after repeating my address, did they still screw that up??  And, assuming I got the packaging, Lord only knows what would happen if they screwed things up AFTER sending out the discs.

My respect for Warner Bros has gone down quite a bit.

02/09/07 update:  Once I did get the packaging to send them my old discs, it took just under 2 weeks for the replacement ones to arrive.

I missed out on the 4-disk collector's edition of Superman.  I was shopping online for Superman Returns when I stumbled across this listing and put it on my wish list.  I'm ever so glad that I did.  This is everythign I've ever wanted as far as  Superman goes.  I would have to call this set the ""Definitive Set"" for Superman fans everywhere.

If you loved Reeve, and were gratified to see his legacy built upon rather than remade, you will LOVE this set.

As far as Superman 3 and the disk problem and the soundtrack problem with Superman 1 [4 disk edition], disk 1 goes .. Warner Brothers will replace those Region 1 disks free of charge.  Yes, it's a hassle, and someone really, REALLY dropped the ball where this set is concerned, but at least they are recitfying the problem instead of merely changing the information concerning what is offered in this set.  That would have been akin to theft, but it HAS been done before.  I commend Warner Brothers for taking these steps to foster good will with their customers.

The set itself, aside from those 2 disks [unfortunately, Superman 3 is my favorite movie in this line because of  Richard Pryor so it figures that would be the main omission], this set is THE set we Superman fans have been waiting for.  The Donner Cut of Superman 2 is a monumental treat.  And for those of you, like me, who missed out on the 4-disk Collector's Edition of Superman 1, it's back in its 4-disk form.  The only problem with Disk 1 is that the 1978 mono was omitted from the tracks.  It still runs at 5.1 surround and sounds magnificent.

As a movie fan I own plenty of boxed sets (Star Wars,Indiana Jones,Matrix...just to name a few)but none of them compare to the Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition. The detail and depth that has been put into this collection is unbelieveable. Even the keepsake tin that the set comes in feels & looks special!!!

Everything that a true Superman fan would want is in this Collection. Witness the best of the early films (1 & 2) completely remastered and see the true Superman Christopher Reeve in action. Be amazed with the Supeman for the new generation in Superman Returns.

With over 20 hours of SPECIAL FEATURES it doesn't get more comprehensive than this!!!My personal pick of the special features is Look,Up In The Sky! This DVD charters you through Supeman's History,including past,present and future...You will learn of his beginning as a comic book character,the success of Superman 1&2,the disappointment of 3&4,the 2001 reawakening of Superman in the acclaimed tv show Smallville and the success of the awesome Superman Returns. Legends Christopher Reeve and Marlon Brando are also rightfully honoured.

I have nothing but praise for this Collector's Set,this is true 5 Star Entertainment. This box set is a fitting tribute for a hero,prepare to be amazed!!!",1165622400,8,1315,5.164319248826291
2665392,5,B000J10ERE,"Okay, by now we all know that this ""Ultimate Collector's Edition"" box set came with some problems. The bonus features for Superman 3 are not on there, which included deleted scenes and a vintage TV special. The other thing missing is the sound transfer for the original Superman film. Quite frankly, when you see what this set has to offer, those two things become very, very minor. Sure, it would of been interesting to see the Superman 3 features, but since the movie was not very good, and a lot of fans disregard the film entirely, it's nothing I am going to get broken up about. And about the sound for the first film?. I couldn't really care. Sounds good to me. This is still a magnificent purchase, and the massive collection of material here is unmatched and will most definitley have you forgetting what wasn't included. However, you can call the phone number to Warner and it's over and done. Simple as that. Now, since the set is packed to the gills with movies and all the bonus features, I couldn't possibly comment on everything. What I can say right off the bat is that there is no better release out there for Superman than this. It's just amazing. 14 discs of perfectness. It has everything. The box itself is quite fun and very cool. There is no individual DVD box for every movie. Instead, they are more like DVD sets of TV shows. Clear pages with the discs on them. Superman 1 and 2 shaped my childhood. They were the first movies I ever saw, and they are great. I will always remain loyal to Superman 11, but the Richard Donner cut is incredible and fun to watch. It's a tighter and stronger film than the original cut, but I still love the original. Superman 3 and 4 are nothing to write home about, but they are a part of the history. But the real meat here are the extra bonus features. They, like the title of my review, boggle the mind. What is most fun here is the inclusion of the George Reeves movie ""Superman And The Mole People"". Cheesy and not great, but it's cool to have. A ton of the Fleischer Superman cartoons that I am not overly familiar with are here, and it's a great look back on some truly wonderful cartoons. The silly TV special on Superman's 50th anniversary is included, and it's hilarious to watch, even if it is high camp. The Superman documentary ""Look, Up In The Sky"" is here, as well as an all new documentary for the set that may just be even better. This one seems to have almost everybody in it that were involved in the Superman legacy in some shape or form. It's amazing. A tribute to Christopher Reeve is also included here, and very well deserved. What would this set be without something for the best Superman?. The ""Superman Returns"" material is great. Loved the movie, and the nearly 3 hour documentary on the film is amazing and a joy to watch from start to finish. Also included is director Bryan Singer's video journals, which were available online but I never saw. In the end, you can't do any better than this set. Okay, the defected discs could of been here from the get go, but that is nothing compared to what is here. Don't get the wrong impression of this set because of what's missing. What is here is far greater than what isn't. It is an essential purchase for any fan. Simply amazing.",1165536000,13,3260,4.435
2665393,3,B000J10ERE,"The Superman movies I and II deserve more than 5 stars in my book.  III and IV are not as great, but still worth having.  I will be watching the new ""Superman Returns"" movie for the first time from the DVDs in this set, because I did not go to the movie theater for it.  There are two things that I would like to express about this release:

1. Warner Bros should recall the sets with the incomplete discs from the stores, instead of continuing to sell them and making the customers go through the trouble of exchanging them.  It is also less than curteous that they make customers send back the wrong discs first before they would send out the replacement discs.  (The missing content on the wrong discs may be more important to some and less important to others - but that should not affect the level of consumer rights we are entitled to.  I have already paid full price for the merchandise, and do not appreciate having to be stay on hold on the phone for half an hour to put in a simple exchange request, and then having to wait the very slow 3-4 week turn-around for them to send the correct discs.)

2. I opted for this ""ultimate"" edition instead of the ""Christopher Reeve"" edition because of the richer bonus materials.  I am also looking forward to seeing the new movie Superman Returns, and have nothing against it.  However, for a 5-movie series where Christopher Reeve is the star of 4 of them (and forever the ONLY Superman for many of us), I personally feel that it is unjustified for the newest movie Superman Returns with newcomer Brandon Routh to occupy the biggest glossy color pictures all over the interior of the box set, and not using any images from the Christopher Reeve movies.

Deducting a star for each of my two points, I still think the set is worth owning.  You decide if you want to go through the risk of getting the wrong discs and the trouble of exchanging them.",1165449600,7,1896,4.432276657060519
2665403,5,B000J10ERE,"Because of space limitations, I will refrain from detailed reviews of individual movies, and will restrict myself to reviewing this set as a whole.  I have already reviewed most of these films as separate items.

The first cinematic incarnation of Superman was animated, and the original Max Fleischer shorts remain a wonder to behold.  The plotting is tight, Lois Lane is feisty, and the animation is totally deserving of the Oscar nomination it garnered.  Warners has highly touted the Max Fleischer cartoons as being remastered from superior vault elements, but they don't look much better to my eyes than the earlier DVD issues.

Three live action Supermen are featured here and make for fascinating comparison: George Reeves, highly charismatic, but with no distinction between Clark Kent and the Man of Steel; Christopher Reeve, for my generation the definitive Superman in real life as well as on film; Brandon Routh, whose interpretation is so similar to Reeve one feels Routh is channeling him.  These films have never looked or sounded better.  It is disappointing, however, that there are numerous deleted scenes and snippets (particularly from the 1978 film) which were not included in the bonus material.

As is noted elsewhere, both versions of Superman II are included, and are a study in contrast.  Comparing the Donner and Lester versions, I must say I prefer Donner's version on the whole but find Lester's ending, with the annoying ""amnesia kiss"" to be a lesser letdown then Donner's turn the world back retread.  It's interesting to hear how Ilya Salkind's views on Superman II and the firing of director Richard Donner diverge from nearly everyone else's.

A plethora of TV specials are offered, from the sublime (2006's ""Look! Up in the Sky...""), to the ridiculous (1988's 50th Anniversary special hosted by Dana Carvey).  Just about every documentary ever filmed about Superman is also offered, many not seen in decades.  Other bonuses include several Warner cartoons spoofing Superman, and the inane Superpup TV show, which fortunately never went beyond the pilot.

Despite an initial production snafu, Warner Brothers has released the definitive Superman collection with this mammoth 14-disc set.  With the notable exception of the Kirk Alyn serials, every cinematic incarnation of Superman is featured here.  Warner Brothers has done an excellent job presenting and packaging this material.  The container is sturdy and attractive, the booklet handy, and the set even comes with an offer for five Superman film posters.

1. For the people complaining like school girls and silver spoon filled mouthed people out there saying that Warner cased this great box set up like crap...The box isn't crap, you people are full of something else and it isn't crap.  I am a box set collector and this set has everything you want when it comes to a  DIE HARD HARD CORE TO THE CORE SUPERMAN FAN(Like me)The tin is for COLLECTING PURPOSE, not to store or put your holiday candy or cookies in it, so get over it.  The lenticular cover is great art.

2. To the reviewer that had his disks come to him broken and fingerprints on them, that ISNT WARNERS FAULT dumbo! Read [...] rules and instructions on box sets being shipped in the mail. I have worked for a well known retail outlet that I used to ship dvds all around the nation and thats not WARNERS FAULT, thats the mail room slash shipping department, so go call the customer service line and quit finding ways to blame WARNER

Now on to the box set
All the disks except 4 and Superman 1 disk that was messed up are null and void, the Donner cut is exceptional and makes SUPERMAN RETURNS more complete and a full circle of films, as intended by Bryan Singer when we was working on SUPERMAN RETURNS and in between filming, he hung out with editors and Donner and saw the ""remaking"" of SUPERMAN II.  I love the extras(YOU WILL BELIEVE with excellent and gives more insight to the Salkinds and how much the defined the definition of ""pirate"" producers)Also, watch the YOU WILL BELIEVE disk and listen to the Genius of Marlon Brando on why he would ahve played Jor-El as a Bagel

2665407,4,B000J10ERE,"I read with much interest the reviews for the Superman Ulitmate set. I consider the 14 discs (of which, with the exclusion of Superman III and IV) to be an exceptional value. Now as for the packaging--well lets us say that it is less than stellar. Allow me to say as for the outer tin box, unlike the King Kong (1933) Collector's tin DVD packaging that was available last year, this tin is pitifully thin. It could have certainly been made thick enough (as Warner's Kong certainly was)so as to not make it so blessedly easy to dent. My goodness, an infant can damage the thing. Now as for the interior--specifically the accordian hard plastic design for the discs. I quite cordially hate them, for this and any other sets--the reason being that, unless I haven't acquired the necessary finesse to remove the discs, you can easily enough bend them while attempting to remove them from the hub. And this cannot be good for the integrity of the disc itself, since that has been know to damage them. As a suggestion for future sets--put the discs in SOFT cases. Yes, those slender ones that the cheapo dollar discs come in. At least you do not have to torque the disc (the most valuable part of the DVD boxset obviously)in order to remove them. And the hub will not crack or break as in the Super set. Sure, it will take up a little more room, but not at the expense of ill-conceived storage that doesn't do these precious discs any justice. I have taken the discs out of the set and placed them in vinyl sleeves, two discs to each sleeve, having a clean piece of paper between the two. For me it is MUCH easier to access the set. Just my opinion folks.

But really, apart from my gripe, I love that Warner has released all the films and has all those extras which appeal to extras enthusiasts such as myself.",1165190400,7,1805,4.436746987951807

But I bought this set twice, and all of the discs were scratched to pieces in both sets, and to boot had fingerprints abound on them.  And I had the same problem with their ultimate Matrix set as well.  And in Salt Lake where I bought it, these were gone extremely fast, and so the second set I had to buy was all the way down in American Fork, with accidents all over the road making it take about 2 1/2 hour drive.  Only to find out when I got this set, I was not the only person experiencing the same problems.  Trust me people.  I know it would be awesome to have the bonus discs and documentries, but is it worth the risk?  This are brand new!  They shouldn't be looking like copies you'd find at the library or video store!  You have to decide that.  But as for me, I'm never buying one of Warner Brothers ""Limited Edition Giftsests"" anymore, it's not worth the headache.

2665411,4,B000J10ERE,"First of all, let me tell you that I have a received an absolutely perfect set, no dent, no scratches, nothing. I am thrilled to dive into this massive collection!

The only glitch for me is the case of ""Superman 3"" which is the same as the box set edited in 2001. I'd like to have it replaced just for the sake of having an extended edition and also to have it in better quality than the previous set (this is the first movie I saw on the silver screen so I want the deluxe edition promised). I don't care about the 2.0 dolby track for Sup's 1 because I got the old box set.

The only problem is that I am a french customer and I'd like to know if the replacement from Sup's 3 will be possible.",1164931200,6,695,3.9928057553956835
2665412,5,B000J10ERE,"Alright, I know all around there's the HUGE buzz on the faulty discs, and I got on of those sets, so I'm feeling it like everyone else.  I did call the 1-800 number, and all I had to leave was my name and phone number; was told it would be 24-48 hours for them to call back.  Well, been well over 48 hours, so I'm wondering should I call the number back and follow up, or continue waiting?  I did get some details on how the replacement discs would be handled - from receiving the fixed, to sending the bad back.  But I've been seeing reviews how there were some that already are expecting the envelopes, and how they had to indicate the barcode info, etc., if anyone could give me some helpful tidbits on how things are going, I would GREATLY appreciate it.  On with my review.

Man, I grew up with Superman my whole life.  I'd say he's my favorite superhero (tied with Batman though).  I also must say that Superman Returns really thrilled me to the point where I was nearly shedding tears - I liked it that much.  So this was a true follow-up to the previous set (well, with the afforementioned exception of course, for now).  Furthermore, the Donner Cut of Superman II is totally worth the price tag along with the main attractions.  Quite frankly, it's an attraction of its own!

The documentary exclusive to this set, ""You Will Believe"" is magnificant!!!  It covers many many more details that you couldn't fathom (I still have yet to check out ""Look in the Sky!,"" but I'm betting it's just as thrilling).

It's just nice to have this to look back at.  I can't help but looking back at the original groundbreaking epic, how it wondered us, then in the end made us gag and cringe thanks to III and IV.  ***On the side, I find a twisted pleasure looking at IV just to marvel at its pathetic quality against the other four.  And I will say that the movie DOES have SOME good things about it, but doesn't help the movie at all obviously.****  Then of course there's the sweetness of Singer's rebooting of the franchise with ""Returns.""  What can I say, it's that good.

There are good box sets, ranging from the Star Wars trilogy, The Lord of the Rings Extended Editions, the Alien movies, and the Indiana Jones flicks.  This box set I can tell everyone is worth every Washington bill.  Superhero geeks everywhere will get a kick out of this.  Also, the offer for the free posters is SWEET, and I'll be getting that (of course, as soon as I get the disc replacement issue resolved).

There's my review.  Now if only my discs can get here soon, I'll be totally thrilled.  It may be Superman III which is admittably rather inferior, I still like the Superman VS Clark ""tango"" a WHOLE LOT!!!  However, the original audio I'm eager to hear again in its dated glory.

To whoever reads this review, has the bad set and is waiting patiently like I am, share your thoughts on how you like the set, and how you're doing with getting them replaced and all.",1164844800,9,2947,4.417439703153989
2665423,5,B000J10ERE,"The reviews of this set here almost convinced me not to buy it.  I'm glad I didn't pay attention.  The set is awesome and absolutely packed with Superman stuff.  It's a great value for the price even with the issues on Superman III and on Superman: The Movies - and both those issues were solved by WB before the box even hit.  If you want the Superman III extras and the stereo track of the first film then give WB a call and you'll get it.

My tin case was not dented or scratched.  All of the discs were in great shape and easy to get to.  One reviewer's complaints about the packaging are completely unfounded.

This set has extras littered all throughout.  You will need the guide that is in the package.  You get all of the Fleischer cartoons, Superman and the Mole-men, some Looney Tunes cartoons that made a bit of fun of Superman, several documentaries, the Donner cut, and all the theatrical releases.  There's also the extended Superman from 2000.  The price is great for all the goodies - the Ultimate Superman box set.  If you are a fan of Superman then this set is a must-have.

Don't listen to the naysayers, the set is great!",1164844800,11,1141,4.3971291866028706

While my set has no physical issues, it is missing the special features on Superman 3 (but who really cares anyway...) and is I guess missing the Dolby 2 track on Superman 1 (again, not a big deal, neither is it a deal breaker. Maybe a luxury if Dolby 2.0 is a big deal for you, but not really all that important.)

All the movies are intact and work. The Up In the Sky has a different cover, but again, cosmetic and who cares! This set rocks the way it is. If there is an issue that keeps everything from playing correctly, then sure, make a fuss. Otherwise keep things in perspective.

I have ordered, bought and received over 800 box sets in the past three years and never had a scratched disc and I am as careful as the next person.

My Superman Ultimate edition boxset is perfect, no disc scratches, no authoring errors. My only complaint is that I didn't receive the right Superman 3 disc with the making of documentary, but then again since the movie really stinks who cares.

Please stop flooding the comments with your bad experiences, because all they do is mean something to you and do not reflect Warner brothers.

2665427,1,B000J10ERE,"Okay, here's the skinny on this quote, ""Ultimate Edition"", 14 disc, Superman DVD set.

I picked up a copy of this set at The Future Shop, here in Canada, and opened it up in my car to make sure that all of the discs were free of marks (you'd be surprised at how many pre and post production marks/scratches I find on brand new, unopened, unloose, DVD's, and we're not just talking the odd blemish, we're talking someone took a fork to the play surface, kind of marks).

Well, first of all, upon opening the tin (which had dents in it, even though I picked through 15 different sets to try and get a dentless tin, the cheap metal of this tin, made this impossible) I found a DVD bundled set, pretty much like the Buck Rogers, or Babylon Five DVD sets, with a piece of black foam, loosely placed on the right hand side of the set, to take up the extra room (of which there was about an inch) to stop the set from bashing about inside the tin during shipping.

The set case itself has seven, double sided, clear plastic, DVD trays, linked together on the left hand side, by some sort of plastic hinges (at least it's not by tape, as is the case with the Star Trek, original series, CD sized, clear plastic, cases) with a disc on the front and back of the trays, and the whole thing is anchored on the bottom to a thick cardboard, booklet type cover, and the whole thing comes in a plastic slip case (once again, like the Buck Rogers, DVD set) which has Superman flying and smashing through a metallic Superman ""S"" on the front, and a picture of the new Superman from, Superman Returns, on the back.

I found this setup to be very awkward, and it made getting at the discs (especially the back of the tray discs) pretty hard to do, without fear that you were going to either drop the discs, brake the plastic hinges or pop the trays loose from the cardboard booklets, backing (which is just held on by four measly dabs of glue).

So, one by one I popped out the discs, and out of the fourteen discs, four had scratches on them (one of which was caused by the fact that the injection hole for the plastic DVD trays, is positioned right in the middle of where the discs sits, and since the discs don't sit very far from the trays surface, if this injection spot hasn't been sufficiently buffed down, and any of the injected plastic is at all sticking up on this spot, then you end up with a nice, circular scratch on the discs play surface, due to the fact that the discs spin slightly on the centre locking hub, during transit).

So I took the set back, and after standing in the customer service line for almost half an hour (and this was first thing in the morning, so you'd assume that the line would be pretty non-existent) I exchanged it for a new set.

But, so as to make one blemish free set, by exchanging only the marked discs in the old set with discs from the new set, I opened the new set at customer service, and guess what; this set had six discs marked up, including the same four ones from the previous set.

Well that was it for me where this, ""Ultimate Mess"" was concerned, and I opted instead to get the, Christopher Reeve Collection box set (which is just a slip cover housing movies one to four, in their regular plastic, DVD cases) The Richard Donner Cut DVD (as, stupidly, it's not included in the, Christopher Reeve Collection, go figure) and the, Superman Returns DVD.

Now granted, I paid about $30 Canadian, more, and didn't get the three bonus discs (""Look Up In The Sky"", which was on A&E, and is available for cheap, on DVD, and the, ""Bryan Singer Journals"", which was supposably downloadable from online, and, You Will Believe: The Cinematic Saga of Superman, which unfortunately, is only available in this set) or the, Superman comic reproduction (which amounted to nothing more then a flimsy, pamphlet style booklet) or the mail in offer for the five, Superman posters, but all of the discs bought this way, where in immaculately pristine condition, with all of the proper contents per disc, intact.

Not to mention that the regular cases are much nicer then that, Ultimate Editions, plastic nightmare of a double sided tray system, and ill fitting metal tin with dents.

So for peace of mind, forgo the, Ultimate Edition, and its need to return two of the discs back to Warner Brothers, due to authoring errors, the crappy case set up, as well as the scratched discs and do what I did.

You'll be less stressed for it.

***FURTHER NOTE: Due to the newer reviewers who seemed to think that I had no right to rag on this, ""Ultimate"" set, and kind of wanting bonus disc, You Will Believe: The Cinematic Saga of Superman, the one with the extra content that you can't find (in one form or another) separate from this set, I (stupidly) took a chance at a completely different DVD store, which had one pristine looking set left, and purchased it again (figuring on selling the individual discs that I had bought earlier, at a used DVD place)

Well, guess what, this one had six of its fourteen discs with scratches, and almost all, had finger print smudges on them (and yes, this set was brand new and sealed, and not a repack).

Luckily for me, that since the store had only one copy in stock, they let me trade it in for other DVDs that I wanted.

***AND EVEN FURTHER MORE: As I have the original Superman DVD box set, the one released in 2000, and now also posses the newer versions of the DVDs, I was planning on selling them to a local used DVD place, but upon checking the original, Superman the Movie, disc, against the newer DVD, I discovered that the picture quality is actually slightly better in the older edition, as the newer disc (disc 2 in the four disc, new set for the first movie, as both it and the 2000 disc have the extended cut versions, and thus, you'd expect the picture to be the same if not better) has a slight redish colour flux on the middle/right side of the screen, which is most noticeable during the opening credits, where as the 2000 disc has no visible colour variation during this same scene.",1164844800,14,6051,4.4134529147982065
2665428,4,B000J10ERE,"My Superman Ultimate collection was sent by Amazon to me in Australia last week. I have not recived it yet, but when I do does anybody know how International customers go about getting their replacement discs through Amazon?",1164758400,,224,4.921052631578948
2665429,3,B000J10ERE,"I'm still waiting for my replacements discs. It's been over a month now. What terrible service. Anyhow, the picture quality of this box set is not as good as the new James Bond box sets. I would think that the picture quality of a newer series would be just as good or better than an older series of films.",1164758400,,306,4.203389830508475
2665430,3,B000J10ERE,"Although this is a Great collection, Warner did mess it up and didn't warn in advance (they had to have known, but probably wanted to get this out for the Christmas season).  Basically, the Superman III disk does not have any of the promised special features, as noted by some reviewers.  In addition, disk one of the four disk Superman I part does not contain the 1978 Dolby 2.0 version, as promised.  If you bought the standalone sets of four disk Superman I set or standalone Superman III  that also came out on the 28th, this problem doesn't exist; only with the Ultimate or Christopher Reeve collections.  As to whose fault it is, could be the company that printed the disk, could be that Warner supplied the wrong master, who knows?  There was definitely a QA problem at both companies, though for this to happen.  What's done is done.

Warner promises to fix it through an exchange, but it's not particularly ""elegant"".  First, you must call 800-553-6937.  After waiting your turn to get through, they ask for your information, including where you bought it.  Then they will ask you for the ""catalog code"" (it's actually the proof of purchase code), which is near the UPC bar code.  The UPC is on the sleeve the box came in.  If you've already gotten rid of that, it is also on the bottom of the tin in very small numbers.  This requirement is reasonable, in order to prove you really bought it.  Then it gets interesting.  In one or two weeks you are supposed to get, not the replacement disks, but some prepaid envelopes from Warner.  You take the two ""problem disks"" and mail them back to Warner.  When your disks arrive back there, they go into the queue for processing.  Once they've verified they have your disks, and once they've remastered sufficient disks, they're supposed to mail the replacement disks you need.  The estimate as of Dec. 1 was that the whole process would take four-five weeks from the time you first contact them (this is assuming that they print the corrected Superman I disk 1 on shcedule, providing you send back the disks as soon as you get the envelopes).  They acknowledge that during this period you will not have any form of those two disks.  This also renders the set unreturnable to where you bought it, by the way.  When asked what happens if the disks you send back or the disks they send you get lost in the mail (a lot of stuff gets lost around big volume mail periods like Christmas), since you won't have any proof, they don't yet have a plan.

It seems that this is a cumbersome way to do this, and will cost Warner more what with having to pay double postage, extra processing and all, so one wonders why they did it this way (why not just send replacement disks to those who have proof of purchase?.  Here's a Possible explanation:  It's well known that most people don't return defectives if they can't take it back to the store where they got it (Amazon is unusual in tha they're taking care of people here).  Maybe Warner made a business decision that it would be less exepnsive overall to set up a cumbersome mitigation process.  By insuring  a very small percentage of actual exchanges, their overall costs are much less.  Then they could truthfully say that they have a process to take care of people, knowing full well that the process is sufficiently troublesome that the vast majority won't bother.

They acknowledged they're going to correct the problem in production and sets manufactured later will deliver what's advertised.  The company that Warner has outsourced the replacement exercise to is saying the information that they have is that correct sets of the collections will not get to stores for two to three months. We'll see.  Keep this and the exchange process in mind when making the decision when to buy.

To those chastising others for being petty complaining about this:  Yes, it's a great collection.  Yes, it's true that Superman III special features may not be that big a deal, and that the problem with Superman I's Dolby mix is not the end of the world (although the promised Dolby 2.0 mix is actually better) and that Warner promises to exchange (at least for domestic US sets).  That's all true, but why should customers who have already paid for the product have to go through all these hoops just to get what they were promised?

UPDATE:  I bought this set on Nov 28th and contacted Warner the same day.  You'll note that in the above timeline I gave based on Warner's information, I should have gotten the prepaid envelope 7-10 days from then.  As of today (Dec 24) there's no sign of the return envelope, so don't take the timeline I gave above as gospel. BTW, the phone number now shuts down at 7 PM PST M-F.  I find it interesting that Amazon no longer sells the Ultimate Edition (maybe they're waiting for the corrected sets to avoid eating the cost of returns that aren't their fault) itself.  Even more interesting, the Ultimate Edition is no longer listed on Warner Home Video's web site.  Hmmmm....",1164758400,33,4995,4.627272727272727

2665454,5,B000J10ERE,"I should add this with What's the Switch?[a Kim Possible game] and Playstation 2. for Christmas/birthday. Superman Ultimate Collector's edition. I hated the Superman:The Movie in Widescreen,I hate widescreen! I hope none of these movies are in widescreen,and I hope the 3rd one has the Wheat King Scene has Brad and Gus talking about his boss,and Smallville Flash. I would also love Superman Returns.",1164067200,2,400,5.265625
2665455,5,B000J10ERE,"The first time I watched Superman (1978) I was six years old, and I truly believed a man could fly.  Who is he?  He's a friend, He's what we strive for, HE's SUPERMAN.  This set is going to rock and roll and it is finally getting the props that it deserves.  It will have the Richard Donner cut (Superman II) which I have never seen before.  Although I did not agree with Christopher Reeves religious background (He was Unitarian and I am not) I still admire him as the Man of Steel and he was a great human being.  I still watch Superman in awe, and though the last two Christopher Reeve Superman movies were not as good, I still enjoy watching them, because Christopher Reeve was perfect for the role of Clark Kent / Superman.

Thank you for the memories, Christopher Reeve, RIP.",1164067200,4,781,4.381944444444445
2665456,5,B000J10ERE,"What can you say about a movie collection that truly has all the Superman movies in one box.(Serials Don't realy count although they were shown in the theatres). Add to that hours upon hours of tv specials, extra footage and a movie that was never even released in theatres.(Once again special screenings of this movie do not count as being released.)You can say SUPER MAN! Young or Old,New to Superman and comic books,or die hard fans(yes that would be me). This collection should not be passed up...especialy at this price. Ten years from now half the stuff in the box set will be worth twice as much to new collectors. BET ON IT!",1163548800,2,632,4.601769911504425

2665458,4,B000J10ERE,"This is an outstanding boxset and I have only one complaint. Superman 1 and 2 are mastered in

dolby digital 5.1 but not 3 and 4, all you get is dolby surround which is what you got with the original dvd release. Still,they are worth getting for the deleted scenes and the audio commentaries.",1162598400,6,292,4.407407407407407
