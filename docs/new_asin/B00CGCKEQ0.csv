8581593,5,B00CGCKEQ0,"This Barney DVD is all about using your imagination as Barney and friends dress up as shipmates and a princess.  There are four episodes so you can watch them all or one at a time.  I love how Barney though pushes kids to use their imaginations as these days it seems like forget to be creative and imaginative.  My 2 year old danced and sang right along with Barney and Friends.  Very wholesome and cute!

Episodes include:

Imagine That!
Seeing
Let Your Creativity Fly!
Let's Go For a Ride!

Plus Bonus Features:

Imagination Vacation game
If I lived under the sea karaoke music video
I hear music everywhere karaoke music video

I received this DVD to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.",1377648000,,704,4.612903225806452
8581594,5,B00CGCKEQ0,"I love shows that inspire imagination and creativity so I was happy to show my kids Barney: Imagine with Barney. I have to admit I'm not the most creative person ever and sometimes have a hard time thinking up things for my kids to do when we're stuck inside during a heat wave like we're currently having. Luckily it's Barney to the rescue!

Watching Barney with my kids actually gives me ideas to try new things (ok so I just copy his but same difference!) We ""built"" our own airplane and flew around the neighborhood. I just took a trip without the kids so this was also a perfect opportunity to talk to them about what flying and traveling are like.

My kids also liked the bonus features, especially the music videos. They love learning new songs and singing and dancing along with them. I love it when a positive song gets stuck in their head and they walk around singing it.

Barney: Imagine with Barney is such a great tool for enhancing kids imagination and helping mom out in the creative play department!",1373328000,,1015,4.505434782608695
