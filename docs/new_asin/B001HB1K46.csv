3627899,4,B001HB1K46,"This is a crisp, well-structured documentary which brings together most of the principal facts and figures in Polanski's 1977-1978 unlawful sexual intercourse trial.

Two are missing from the scene -- Polanski himself and Judge Laurence Rittenband, who presided over the case -- and they're the most important and, among followers of the situation, the most divisive.

The filmmakers have a clear respect for Polanski the artist, but they make two points painfully clear: That, in 1977, he gave a 13-year-old girl Quaaludes and champagne before having sex with her; and that the case was poorly (in some cases illegally) handled by Rittenband, who was eventually removed from the case.

Rittenband is dead and Polanski fled to France rather than face his judge's increasingly sketchy demands but most of the principals are here, particularly defense attorney Douglas Dalton, former assistant D.A. Roger Gunson and the victim herself, Samantha Geimer, who's now in her mid-40s, a mother of three children and seems ready to put the whole matter to rest.

The account is fascinating, and artfully punctuated by scenes from Polanski's films, particularly those he appeared in including ""Chinatown,"" ""The Tenant"" and ""The Fat and the Lean,"" which was made a decade-and-a-half before the trouble but which features Polanski dancing on cue to a drum beaten by a man who, ironically, bears no small resemblance to Rittenband himself.

I never like to assume that I'm an expert on a situation simply after seeing one documentary about it, but it's a persuasive argument when a Mormon district attorney sides with a sex offender and his defense lawyer against a judge. That's pretty convincing evidence this movie is spouting something close to the truth.",1225584000,26,1746,5.2214285714285715
3627910,4,B001HB1K46,"What would happen if Roman Polanski drugged and had sex with a 13-year old girl in America today, with cable television and the Internet magnifying all things salacious, real or imagined, instead of the year it happened, 1977?  Nonetheless, the absorbing 2008 documentary ROMAN POLANSKI: WANTED AND DESIRED reminds us that the famous film director had all but beaten the rap until public outrage made the judge on the case think again, which caused Polanski to flee America for France, never to return.

I tip my hat to director Marina Zenovich, who steers ROMAN POLANSKI: WANTED AND DESIRED in such a way that you can't tell how she feels about Polanski's behavior.  As if attempting to give Polanski the fair trial he never had, Zenovich allows everyone involved to have their say and leaves it to the viewer to make up his or her mind, if he or she can.  Sure, it's still a crime even if you don't realize you're committing a crime.  But if the judge agrees to a psychiatrist's recommendation of probation only to change his mind and throw the book at you because of outside pressures, is that justice?",1372550400,,1105,4.704663212435233
3627911,5,B001HB1K46,"It is difficult to decide how one should judge Roman Polanski and his mistakes. After viewing this documentary I felt both sorry for him and discusted by his criminal behavior in the 1970s. However it is very hard to even begin to know what it must have been like to be at the center of media attention like he was by the mid 1970s. Mr. Polanski was at the top of his game even before this in the late 1960s, his story would have been seen as one of extraordinary inspiration. A young man living with the reality that the holocaust took his own parents from him, he marched on with incredible courage and did some remarkable things in his life. He had established himself as a Hollywood icon who was respected by so many. And when things couldn't have been better his entire life came crashing down with the now infamous and terrible murder of his wife by Charles Manson and his followers. Certainly the scars sustained from such a heartbreaking incident might very well never heal. The damage that such an event might have afflicted to his state of mind might have easily effected his judgement, and could have been the catalyst that drove him to behave so crudely by taking advantage of an innocent minor. Sure Mr. Polanski made some serious mistakes in his life, but his accomplishments some how seem to overshadow his weaknesses. Those in the film and music industries who know and love him often paint a picture of Mr. Polanski as a kind and gentle man with a big heart. None the less, Be it the story of the terrible tragedy of his life, or of his remarkable accomplishments, or the crimes he was accused of, one thing is for certain- I found this documentary totally compelling and completely enjoyable.",1367971200,2,1710,4.5732899022801305
3627912,3,B001HB1K46,"This documentary examines celebrated film director and jet-setter Roman Polanski's arrest and legal troubles in connection with the statutory rape of a thirteen-year-old girl in 1977. Polanski served forty-two days in jail before fleeing the U.S. just prior to sentencing. Society generally has little sympathy for sex offenders but Polanski's celebrity and tragic personal misfortunes (his parents were victims of the Holocaust and his pregnant wife Sharon Tate was slain by the Manson Family) seem to have softened the criticism of some.

Director Marina Zenovich does a good job presenting the sordid tale with news clips along with interviews of the lawyers involved and Polanski's friends and associates. The film stresses that the judge overseeing the case violated legal protocol and possibly presents him as more of a villain than Polanski.

Polanski's victim, Samantha Gailey Geimer, participates in this 2008 documentary and is currently (2013) writing a memoir detailing the incident. The viewer will wonder how Samantha's mother, actress Susan Gailey, allowed her thirteen-year-old daughter to participate in a ""photoshoot"" with Polanski following the director's highly publicized relationship with fifteen-year-old actress, Nastassja Kinski.

Postscript - 9/27/13: In her 2013 memoir, The Girl, Geimer details the circumstances which led to her rape. She makes it a point to exonerate her mother of any responsibility.",1358380800,,1431,5.708920187793427
3627913,5,B001HB1K46,"My father married my mum when he was 24 and she was 15 in 1941.  Today this would be considered molestation.  What Roman Polanski did with this girl was totally orchestrated by her mother and possibly her.  This girl could have sucked the chicken off of a bone.  Like Monica Lewinsky, she knew what she was doing in order to get her career jump started.  If I had been that girl, I would have been so privileged to have been ""sodomised"" by Polanski that I would have thanked my lucky stars.  Those who are calling him rubbish are simply prudish or envious.  With all this man had been through in his life, what could one expect that he would try to escape his pain.  He is brilliant and truly an artist.  France is lucky to have him and I would have done the same as he with that fraud Rittenband for a ""Judge.""

This film is so wonderful that I immediately ordered a copy after watching it someplace else.  There are many great nostalgic photos of him and Sharon in their beginning, of the others surrounding them, and of the time that was.  This film is insightful as to the truth behind the case I had always heard about and never really examined.  One can see the pain on his face and know that his life has been as extraordinary as his art.  God bless Roman Polanski.",1329436800,,1272,4.312236286919831
3627914,1,B001HB1K46,"Asking that question above do you think the sycophantic sympathy of the documentary makers and most of the reviews on here would have given him any slack? Please they would have sharpened the knives and stood inline for days to get in a whack. The most sickening thing about this is the way statute of limitations has been used to excuse or defend Polanski by his admirers, you could use those excuses with a lot of RC Priests undeservingly if you wanted to be a first class hypocrite of the worst sort. After the revealing of log standing sexual abuse by Allison Arngrim and Corey Feldman after Corey Haim's suicide. After Martin Weiss has been charged in LA for sexual abuse, after Fernando Rivas of Sesame street was charged with sexual abuse and child pornography and finally registered sex offender Jason James Murphy worked as a casting agent for years before his past kidnapping and sexual abuse. So where is the outrage and investigation of Hollywood on the scale of the priesthood? Is there any doubt that pop cultures fans and the media are looking the other way and ignoring a scandal the way certain RC Bishops did, merely because they share the same political beliefs? It needs to be aired out because Hollywood is the most corrupt and greedy hypocrites that ever exihisted and have the gall to preach to everyone else.",1325635200,6,1332,4.721030042918455
3627915,3,B001HB1K46,"This documentary by Steven Soderbergh was fascinating and I learned quite a bit about Roman Polanski that I never knew because I hadn't followed his case that closely. I didn't know he was a Holocaust survivor and had lost his parents to the camps. I did know that his wife Sharon Tate was brutally murdered by the freakish Manson clan. And I imagine that all those hideous and traumatic incidents left a terrible and indelible mark on his psyche. But does this somehow justify drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl?

The production is far too sympathetic toward Polanski. Yes, it appears he had a judge who was obsessed with celebrities and his own fame and publicity. Yes, it looks as though his sentence was unfair, but even the original proposal to incarcerate Polanski for 90 days for a diagnostic was absurd. 90 days for taking a pubescent girl and giving her Quaaludes and sodomizing her? Please? What century are we living in?

Although the girl who was molested appeared on the show and spoke as an adult, I got the distinct impression that the message was ""poor Roman"", not ""poor 13-year-old girl."" At one point her prior sexual history was even mentioned -- disgraceful -- yet she clearly said that she had said *no* to him. Even if she had said *yes* and begged him to have sex with her, at 13, she didn't have the mental or legal ability to give consent.

The whole situation is very sad. If only Polanski had served out his time properly in the US, some of this would be behind him and perhaps he could have continued to be a wonderful director. People are complicated. Just because he committed a heinous act doesn't mean that he doesn't have redeeming qualities. He is brilliant and the French realize this. But one problem I had with the documentary is that it's not either or -- it's not that he is wanted in America and desired in Europe where he has won awards, so the Americans are wrong and prudish. It's that he has complex human traits that make him phenomenal in some respects and ugly in others.",1301097600,26,2022,4.580110497237569
3627916,4,B001HB1K46,"Extremely well-balanced documentary. Devolves into a referendum on the central question: how do you feel about teenage prostitution? The film leaves little doubt that the ""victim"" (and her mother, who acted as her pimp) was a willing, and perhaps enthusiastic, participant looking for a payday. This was an experienced thirteen going on twenty-five year old female wannabe actress whose only possible surprise in the proceedings may have been Polanski's taking the booty as well. It may be, also, that Polanski failed to settle accounts promptly enough for Mom's liking. The rest is vanity, ambition, and outright corruption within the criminal justice system.

It is instructive to note that adult/teenage sexual activity was not outlawed in the U.S. until, historically speaking, very recently. New Hampshire still permits an adult to marry a thirteen year-old in certain circumstances. I would argue that chronological age and sexual maturity beyond twelve have little correlation. Anyone who believes otherwise needs to get out more.

Polanski collides with that uniquely American puritanical taboo against anal sex, here enhanced by the age of the girl. I don't doubt that there is a large contingent for whom this act alone would provide a sufficient basis for an impromptu castration.",1288396800,,1291,5.417910447761194
3627917,4,B001HB1K46,"A documentary which reopens the controversial and complex case of director Roman Polanski's public conviction for having unlawful sex with a minor some 30 years ago. The young girl,Samantha Gernier,was 13 at the time. Polanski at the time told her mother he wanted to shoot pictures of her for a French magazine. Her mother allowed Samantha to go off with Polanski to Jack Nicholson's house in Mulholland Drive. Instead,after shooting pictures he gave her champagne and a piece of Quaalude (hypnotic) and he took advantage of her. Because of the drug he sodomised and raped her. ""He wouldn't take no for an answer...it was scary and very creepy"".Samantha and her mother didn't want Polanski to be sentenced. Due to the effect of publicity and the girl's desire for anonymity, charges were later reduced under a plea bargain agreement to a mere `unlawful intercourse with an underage girl'.The judge had turned the case into a circus and reneged on the deal and Polanski, fearing 50 years in jail, fled to France. He had undergone a 42 day psychiatric assessment in custody and was not thought to be a mentally disordered offender. His past experiences,the traumatic loss of his parents under the Nazis and the murder of his wife,even his brilliance as a film director, should not place him above the law,even though he's married with 2 children. Gernier is married with 3 children.

In the film there is an interesting interview over dinner with Clive James. James implies Polanski seems to like surrounding himself with young ladies. Following what has happened to him he should lie low and stay out of site. Polanski disagrees. Polanski says the girl`consented',but James says even if so she was underage. Polanski asks James, almost disappointingly,""is that all you think my life comes to...young ladies""?James suggests he may have a predilection for very young girls and he reacts with amusement: Yes I like beautiful young women,who doesn't?But we also know that the photograph taken of him in Europe with a young woman at a beerfest was used against him. There is a sense that Polanski got the American mind-set very wrong,badly judged American laws,got off too easily(flitting from country to country)and now needs to have this matter put to rest once and for all. We now know Switzerland will not extradite him.

Polanski's life was as weird and eerie as any of his films. The loss of his parents to the Nazis. The way the brilliant Rosemary's Baby seemed to prefigure a kind of bad karma that adhered to him when his young pregnant wife was murdered by Manson's crazed killers. His exploitation of a young girl who wanted to get into film acting, having unlawful sexual intercourse with her after plying her with drink and drugs. This happened after he'd made the fantastic Chinatown. The judge of the case was drawn to celebrity cases. He himself was in a relationship with a woman 30 years younger. He promised an out of court settlement, but gradually reneged on his deal, wanting to put Polanski away for a long time. The film brings out well the innuendoes that Polanski suffered on his wife's death, as if he'd personally got her murdered himself or through his life-style been partly responsible. He has a reckless streak that the press made too much of. He is probably ruthless but charming. Obviously he fled once he got wind of the Judge's manipulations. The Judge was retired from the case soon after. Polanski is probably more appreciated in Europe than in America. He has been told he can go back to America if he allows them to film the court hearing. He has refused this final request. I admire the genius of Rosemary's Baby,Chinatown and The Pianist,without admiring the man who made them. His latest film The Ghost is an ironic comment about his case,an ex PM (British),holed up in America, wanted at a war crimes tribunal in Europe.",1279670400,6,3859,4.872146118721461
3627918,5,B001HB1K46,"Excellent documentary, well researched, giving an unbiased and full account of the Polanski case. Excellent testimony of his lawyer who plainly told him that he could not expect a fair treatment from judge Rittenband.",1266105600,4,217,5.411764705882353
3627919,5,B001HB1K46,"I found the documentary interesting in that Polanski's victim also speaks regarding the 30 year old case that had Polanski fleeing from the US to escape his sentence from a judge he felt was ""out to get him"". Now it seems Polanski wasn't just being cowardly.",1260316800,,258,4.630434782608695
3627930,3,B001HB1K46,"The way this documentary is put together is at times sloppy, at other times plodding, and sometimes it includes footage which is not needed at all, like the absurdist bit with Polanski moving like a puppet outdoors while a man pounds on a drum.  Also, much of the music is irritating and distracting.

That said, it does contain a great deal of info about a case which I knew very little about until Polanski made the recent headlines.  I don't sympathize with him.  He may be a fine director, but we are talking about a preteen girl her, and the use of alcohol and drugs to ply her while she was alone with him.  It's about time he faced up to what he did, no matter how long ago it was, no matter that she forgave him 12 years ago.",1256342400,4,733,4.207142857142857

3627932,1,B001HB1K46,"Throughout his relationship with Sharon Tate, Roman was completely unfaithful and as often as possible. His lack of integrity and disrespect towards women in general has always disgusted me. It was said that Sharon thought having a baby would make Roman finally show her some respect and was very hurt when she realized nothing was going to change him. He always copped out and said ""well Sharon knew what I was like"" or ""she said she didn't want to change me"".  All the while he knew how she really felt. I'm sure when they first met Sharon was naive and said a lot of things about relationships that were considered cool for the times, but everyone who knew the two of them personally also knew that his behavior hurt her. He's a male version of a slut and a total narcissist. I'm glad he finally got some karma action by getting tossed in prison and then prevented from returning to the U.S.  Some years after Sharon's death he said one thing that really shows what he's like, ""It's good that Sharon died before our love could die"" or something very,very close to that. Incredibly stupid. He thinks anything he says is pure art. He really must have thought that was a clever statement. Sharon wasted her time and she wasted her life on this pathetic excuse for a man. He's simply a pervert.",1251158400,16,1293,4.545064377682404
3627933,1,B001HB1K46,"If you're a lawyer or you're somehow related with American legal issues, this was done for you. On the contrary, if you look for an insight of Polanski as an artist, his works and viewpoints on life and human nature, you've certainly made a bad choice. This is an overlong, tedious exposition on Polanski's prosecution on child abuse that might interest viewers who deal with matters of the law. Here, Roman Polanski is a mere object of controversy with legal accusations who could have perfectly been any other person. His artistic talent and creations are not the main subject. The movie simply delivers countless legal details on the impeachment irrelevant to his artistic skills.
As an admirer of this great director, I feel dissapointed and certainly I would not recommend it since it adds absolutely nothing to understand his vision of the world. Besides being boring, it's not very well crafted, resembling a mediocre thesis done by an average cinema student.",1247011200,5,966,5.0062111801242235
3627934,5,B001HB1K46,"Roman Polanski's art has long been overshadowed by the sex scandal in mid-seventies that forced him to flee the United States and establish new life and career in France.  Almost 30 years later, director Marina Zenovich creates a powerful documentary that explores what truly happened.  If one can get over the fact that Polanski admitted to having sex with a 13 year old girl that was consentual, according to him; then this story is a powerful testament about how flawed legal system is in the United States.  Once I finished watching the film, I could not stop asking myslef if anything has changed in US legal system and its participants since.

Director includes Polanski's attorney and the testament from the prosecutor in the case, recollections from journalists that covered the incident and police officers that responded to the initial accusations.  The background story of the judge in the case and his subsequent ruling(s) are absolutely stunning.  All characters in this case are greater than life and both attorneys involved in the case are honorable men worthy of their profession.

This film is also a story about bigotry and prejudices.  US legal system was looking into making an example from a man who was a foreigner, had accent, was short and had devasteting personal history.  He was an easy target and with fame that he had from being a famous film director, it worked to his disadvantage to this day.  I am glad that film shows that cultural differences between America (and Europe in this case) exist to this day.  While Polanski is ""wanted"" in US, he is ""desired"" in France.  The final clips about subsequent outcomes 30 years later show that not much has changed since.

This is an amazing documentary.  Ms. Zenovich did an excellent job in presenting all aspects of the story without taking any sides.  I highly recommend you watch this documentary because it is impossible to retell all aspects of the case.  One must see it for oneself.",1239494400,7,1966,4.876506024096385
3627935,2,B001HB1K46,"The history of Polanski's legal troubles have a lot more twists and turns than I was aware of before watching this film. As the teaser on the cover of the DVD says, ""The truth couldn't fit in the headlines."" But the way the filmmakers present it is really sloppy and confusing. I kept wanting to have some context for these events in Polanksi's life and career, but the film didn't present a clear chronology, especially at the beginning. And the things it left out were really mind-boggling. For example, an extended segment talks about his wife's murder: how it affected him, the press's coverage, etc. Yet it never explains that Tate was killed by the Manson family (although a brief allusion to this fact is made in passing later on in the film). Astounding. How could they leave out such a basic, elemental part of Polanski's story? It's like the filmmakers assume you already know all these things. But then why would you be watching this?

By far the most baffling, incomprehensible part of the film concerns one of the key events. After Polanski had undergone a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation, he went to Europe to begin work on a film with Dino De Laurentis. The final ruling in his case was to be delivered some weeks or months later; he was not in custody and therefore free to travel. While in Europe, he was photographed with a ""girl"" in a beer hall. The photo was shown to Rittenband, the judge in Polanksi's case. According to the film, Rittenband thought it was an outrage that Polanski would let himself be photographed with a ""girl"" in this way, as if he were flouting the court's jurisdiction over him. I use quotation marks because the ""girl"" in the photo appears, to me at least, to be a young woman, about 19 or 20. I don't believe that anybody would peremptorily mistake this young woman to be a minor of 16 or younger. Since she does appear to be on the young side, however, a zealous prosecutor or judge might have attempted to ascertain the woman's factual age--detective work that this film does not do--but you certainly could not conclude from this photo alone that Polanski was having sex with minors in Europe. Such a conclusion is patently irrational, but this film seems to be suggesting that's what the lawyers and judge in California were thinking. It was supposedly on the basis of this photo that the judge came down heavy on Polanski and threatened him with the maximum punishment in absentia. The whole thing doesn't make sense. Were the key players really that insane, or is the film simply doing a lousy job of telling the story in a clear way? The quotations the film uses suggest that the prosecution and judge might have actually been angered by the fact that Polanski was drinking and partying in Europe at a time when he was supposed to be contritely hard at work. That also seems to be way out of a court's jurisdiction--after all, Polanski wasn't in custody, so he should have been able to do as he pleased, as long as it was legal. My point is that, after seeing this film, it's just really hard to tell what people were actually saying and thinking.

The filmmakers' unstated agenda--to vindicate Polanski--is also evident from the things it leaves out. He has admitted in recent years, for example, that he was unfaithful to his first wife, Sharon Tate. Her violent murder serves--in this film as in many other books and films about Polanski--to turn him into a tragic figure. The film doesn't mention his infidelity to Tate, instead focusing on how ""happy"" they were, and how devastated he was by her death. Those things may be true, but the fact that he was unfaithful presents a more complex, ambiguous picture--one that would be worthy of a Polanski film. But not this one.

In short, I thought this film was very confusing in the places I wanted clarity--the facts--and overly simplistic in its interpretation of the facts--""Polanski is a haunted, yet gifted artist who was treated unfairly by the justice system,"" blah, blah.",1236556800,8,3988,4.710601719197708

She was drugged and she was raped.  Roman Polanski perpetrated it.  Innocent men don't run.

The movie is well made but one sided in it's presentation of the facts, no small wonder it was put together by a group of both sycophants and actors who's careers are dead or dying.

She says that it took five years to get the film made: two to get financing and three to actually do it. She also talks about the challenge of merging Polanski's life and the court case. Zenovich points out that it was hard getting archival footage from the 1970s because much of it had been either taped over or lost. Bini talks a lot about the structure of the doc. - for example, where should they start the story? This quite a chatty track as Zenovich and Bini talk about how they put this film together.

3627939,5,B001HB1K46,"When I first heard about this documentary, I was weary of it.  I automatically thought it would be yet another American hack-job on Roman and I wasn't even swayed by the positive reviews it got.

But, boy, did I have to eat my words!  Marina Zenovich presented a very balanced picture of the events of 1977 that actually (whoa!) wound up being sympathetic towards Roman and the fact that he was indeed a victim of the sick, sorry joke that's known as the American justice system.

Clips of Roman's movies, of the press frenzy that prevented justice from taking place on all sides of the issue, and the appropriate focus on the media whore Laurence J. Rittenband (he would have been proud of Lance Ito) woven together provided the background to an unfortunate event.

Her work answered a lot of questions for me, but brought up fresh ones and it was great to see people who have not previously spoken about this open up in a big way.  I will say it was refreshing to see famous people express my sentiments regarding the 1977 incident (all I'll have to say about that is ""Thank you, Mrs. Sylbert!"" and is that all Samantha Gailey Geimer had to say in response?).  It was probably a shock for a lot of people to hear the D.A. in the case, Roger Gunson, say (in a roundabout way) that he understood why Roman fled to France, as it was for Ms. Zenovich when she said ""Really?"" in a tone of complete shock.

Another thing I enjoyed about watching this was the class that came from defense attorney Douglas Dalton.  This case had all the makings of coming to a successful conclusion for everyone with all lawyers involved having clear heads and common sense, but it was very unfortunate that Rittenband was more enthralled with the press and his image than he was in seeing justice served and in being fair to the accused (something that's lost in too many court cases in this country) and I'm both pleased and elated that Ms. Zenovich had the foresight to focus on that here.  (P.S. Could someone please explain why Rittenband was never disbarred?)

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised to see *some* justice done to Roman after all these years, but it still bothers me that, overall, the low-life scumbag Charles Manson and the zombies who did his dirty work are actually looked at more favorably and treated better by the American media than Roman Polanski.  Care to disagree?  Look at the recent press on how wonderful these folks have been in prison and of ""poor"" Susan Atkins and comment.

I've watched this documentary three times in one week and feel better about the treatment Roman was given here each time (especially the very end where Roman proved he didn't need Hollywood to make good, award-winning movies)- even if he did refuse to be interviewed or Ms. Zenovich preferred to let Roman talk via archive footage (whatever the case may be).

This documentary also proved a point that's been long overdue in making: Isn't it time for the grandstanders at the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office to close this case and allow Roman to come back to the States (if he even wants to at this point in time)?  Isn't there a statute of limitations that's been overlooked here that could clear the way for Roman to freely travel the world without fear of arrest for something that happened over 30 years ago?  (Murderers have an easier time of the ""justice"" system than anyone who has been accused of a sex crime in this country).

Now, everyone (especially the American media), here's your homework: It's seriously time to move on (Mrs. Geimer publicly forgave Roman, so who is anyone else?).  Leave Roman alone, let him live his life, and focus more on his work and his present than continue to rehash two very tragic and unfortunate events in his life that happened in 1969 and 1977.  - Donna Di Giacomo",1226880000,8,3806,4.635416666666667
8308410,4,B001HB1K46,"Roman Polanski is, no doubt about it, a criminal who's managed to avoid justice for years. At the same time, the U.S. legal system subjected both him and his victim to a twisted sham of a process that's horrifying to learn about. It's telling that the victim says that she's been hurt twice, first by Polanski and second by the terrible system. The documentary has some flaws, but it's still absolutely worth watching.",1525132800,,418,4.739726027397261

8308412,3,B001HB1K46,"The documentary did a good job at presenting the facts in this case, but went a little overboard on the ""poor Roman"" angle. Undoubtedly this man experienced many horrific things in his life. That is something I am sure most people are not debating. The question is, ""Does his past and the fact that he is hailed as a great director give him the right to break the law?"" And, by the way, yes, PeppermintSF, someone was hurt in this act. A 13 year old cannot consent to sexual intercourse as they are a minor. It's like saying, ""Well, my 13 year old daughter was molested, but at least the guy who did it was a great director."" It should also be pointed out that Polanski admitted to having sex with her. He wasn't stitched up. At the time of sentencing, the fact that Polanski was working on a film and time in prison would prove ""inconvenient"" should never have been considered. It's supposed to be inconvenient-it's prison! Even the most ruthless people in history have some positive traits (not saying that he is the most ruthless man by any stretch).

8308416,4,B001HB1K46,A mostly fair look at the famous Roman Polanski under-aged sex scandal.  While the documentary does paint Roman in a sympathetic light due his history it also places a lot of the blame on the press and a celebrity obsessed judge.  The victim in the case has clearly put the actual incident with Roman behind her but still feels victimized by the press and the crappy way the judge and the judicial system handled the case.,1448150400,,422,4.5394736842105265

It makes one wonder if our justice system could use some cleaning as the judge in this case should have been disciplined. The attorneys (for each side) were professional in every way.

8308418,4,B001HB1K46,"From the severe trauma he went through with the horrific murder of his wife and child to be, not to mention how he lost his mother to the Nazis, Roman Polanski clearly had significant emotional disorders which would and do cause mental disorders- the correlation between the emotional and the mental seem to be overlooked. The physical, emotional and mental are all connected and interwoven and cannot be separated. Certain drugs are effective in treating severe emotional problems which are lodged in the brain and have to be prescribed. This isn't just depression, this takes a strong narcotic given in daily moderate doses. One drug in particular is not used nearly enough - only for the physical when in fact it would work wonders for the emotional and mental as well.  That put together with yoga, meditation and prayer would be a sure cure.
Roman Polanski was clearly a disturbed man whose life would probably have been destroyed in a lengthy prison system as countless others are. Or maybe he would have destroyed himself with the worst drugs out there- alcohol and cocaine.",1419206400,,1081,4.907103825136612
8308419,5,B001HB1K46,"Seemed a thorough accumulation of facts. I came away with questions about how the charges initially came out. Was it just after the act itself while Polanski and the girl were still in Jack Nicholson's home or did the girl wait until she got home and told her mother. That is a gray area for me. It looked like there were two different stories being told from the transcript questions at the beginning of the film about what actually took place. My question, ""Was this simply revenge on a talented director?""",1408924800,,508,4.593406593406593
