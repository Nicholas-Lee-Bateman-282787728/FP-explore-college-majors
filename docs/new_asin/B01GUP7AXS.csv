8763590,3,B01GUP7AXS,"Excellent instructor describing the process, but where this video fails is not showing the actual close up of the electrode movement and rod dipping technique where you can actually see what the weldor is seeing.  Just watching a blinding arc while he welds serves no purpose.  For someone who wants to learn and practice TIG welding, being able to actually see the puddle, the electrode movement, and metal added, as they say...a picture is worth a thousand words.  If this DVD had shown what I mentioned above, I'd have given it 5 stars.",1513987200,,539,4.774193548387097
8763591,5,B01GUP7AXS,"A great DVD, with excellent instructions that are easy to understand
and follow.",1442793600,,80,5.230769230769231
8763592,5,B01GUP7AXS,Good video. Good Transaction.,1416355200,,29,6.5
8763593,4,B01GUP7AXS,Doesn't dwell enough on the specific techniques needed to properly TIG weld.,1412035200,,76,5.416666666666667
8763594,3,B01GUP7AXS,"Not very impressed with this video. Good information, but the video of the actual welding process is pretty poor - does not get close enough to show detail of weld and does not use a dark enough filter to actually show the puddle. Understanding how the puddle moves and flows is critical to beginners understanding what is happening, and is what I expect to see in a professional video.

Would suggest going to Welding Tips and Tricks website for far better video.",1400025600,4,464,4.658536585365853
8763595,4,B01GUP7AXS,"Almost all these welding how-to vids assume the viewer is transferring in from some other mechanical medium, and spends most of their time in a shop... This is a good vid, but it would be better for the hobbyist (as versus and already practiced mechanic/machinist) if it spent an extra five minutes at the beginning reviewing the most basics... other than that, highly recommend as this one doesn't get complicated; however, it spends more time showing you what can be achieved by an expert, rather than laboring through the pitfalls that might prevent such good results... nonetheless, I'd buy it again !",1391212800,,605,4.9411764705882355
8763596,5,B01GUP7AXS,i'm new to welding but need to know how and don't have time for conventional classes. learned a lot. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't know anything about TIG welding.,1369008000,3,178,4.59375
8763597,5,B01GUP7AXS,I am beginning to realize that TIG welding is an art. This DVD is great information for a beginner like myself. Seeing Ron TIG weld aluminum foil was incredible!,1368921600,,161,4.586206896551724
8763598,5,B01GUP7AXS,It goes step by step shows you how to tig much more stronger and pierces than mig weld. harder to learn,1363824000,,103,3.9523809523809526
8763599,5,B01GUP7AXS,Havent TIG welded in a long long time. his DVD definitely brought back some of the basic knowledge and set me up to practice a lot.,1278633600,,131,4.076923076923077
