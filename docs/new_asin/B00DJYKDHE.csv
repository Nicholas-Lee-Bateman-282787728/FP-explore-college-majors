5821964,4,B00DJYKDHE,"God bless this film crew because they really do try their best. They faced a true mission impossible: make a live action adaptation of Richard Bach's Jonathan Livingston Seagull. Could it be done in 1973? Not really, but they were going to try any way. I'm going to attempt summarizing what the film does best and let you decide whether or not you want to see this forgotten movie adaptation. The film failed to set the box office afire in 1973 but it did successfully launch a Grammy winning soundtrack by Neil Diamond and received two Oscar nominations (Editing and Cinematography).

If you're interest in seeing this movie odds are you're a fan of Richard Bach's classic novel, and are solely seeking this film out as a curiosity piece, but for those of you haven't read it I'll summarize the plot.  Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a seagull who lives for flight.  He separates himself from his flock who refuse to accept his obsession with becoming the fastest seagull who ever lived.  In his desire for self-perfection Jonathan reaches a higher state of spiritual being before ultimately returning to impart his wisdom on other members of his flock.

Where this film adaptation really soars is its cinematography.  The visuals are some of the best imaginable for the time the film was made. Even if we get a modern film that uses today's technology to more accurately translate Richard Bach's novel this film does set a standard for cinematography.

Let me outline one of the film's early scenes: In the distance a speck. The aerial shot begins to descend and soon the dot is revealed as a fishing boat and around it circles a flock of seagulls. Cut to the boat's dock. The seagulls hang over head as the crew men begin releasing fish into the water. Close-ups and tracking shots follow the gulls as they descend into the water and begin fighting over the food. At the end of the scene the boat and gulls are seen as silhouettes in the sunset. This is immediately followed by a series of sweeping aerial footage of a gull flying high above the clouds. We follow this one gull over multiple landscapes to the sound of Neil Diamond's Be. It is simply breathtaking! Sequences like this are magnificently composed and executed and justify the film's Academy nominations for cinematography and editing. Watching moments like this make you yearn for a digitally remastered, hi-definition release.

The live action seagull footage --for the most part-- really works for Part 1 of the story. Where it becomes shaky is when dialogue scenes between Jonathan and the other seagulls occur, but that doesn't take away from the moments in Part 1 where the film gets it right.  When Jonathan is giving up his dreams after a crash the footage of hurt seagull emerging from the water, beaten and battered, struggling to climb aboard a portion of driftwood it's hard not to get emotional. It's probably because we the audience hate seeing a hurt animal, but for the purpose of the film moments like this do capture the spirit of the book.  Niel Diamond's soundtrack is optimistic and does capture the right tone for Richard Bach's novel.  When the movie plays as a seagull centered music video the movie does extraordinarily well.

When Jonathan is shown with voice over narration there is something, and for those moments I can suspend my disbelief and believe that this is Jonathan Livingston Seagull but then another dialogue scene will come to ruin it because at the end of the day dialogue between the characters is essential to Richard Bach's tale. Perhaps the filmmakers could have been REALLY ambitious and attempted to tell the story without any dialogue at all, but the animal footage would have to be nothing less than perfect for that to have worked.

Where the live action seagull footage begins to fall apart is Part 2, after Jonathan has ascended into a higher state of being.  This is where live action nature footage just can't begin to capture the spirit of the book.  They try, but Parts 2 and 3 call for something supernatural which cannot be captured in real-life animal footage.  The cinematography remains gorgeous as a nature documentary, but cannot begin to capture the spiritual bliss of the novel.  It is at this point that the film falters and ultimately fails but it is not for a lack of trying.

Jonathan Livingston Seagull may not reach the heights of the novel, but one has to give credit to the filmmakers because like the titular gull they never gave up.  They did their best with what they had available and I don't believe they have anything to be ashamed of.  I would love to see another crack taken at Jonathan Livingston Seagull using today's digital animation, for that will likely be the only way of truly capturing the essence of Bach novel, but I do tip my hat to the determination of these filmmakers who set out to do the impossible.

I am thankful that the Warner Archive Collection has added Jonathan Livingston Seagull to their offerings so that others like myself are granted easy access to this film adaptation of the book we love. It has its flaws, and doesn't reach the same heights, but it is commendable and worth seeing for fans.  Maybe one day we'll get a digitally remastered release.  If for nothing else the cinematography deserves to be seen in hi-definition.",1377993600,29,5305,4.761177753544166

5822058,5,B00DJYKDHE,"I was inspired by the book at 10 yrs old,  nurtured by the Neil Diamond Soundtrack for decades, and finally at 53 yrs old, I have seen the film.  At the time of the film's release, no one in my flock had any interest in seeing the film, and I was too young to drive myself to the theatre.  The movie theatre engagement seemed brief . . . so JLS was gone (no VHS, DVD, or Blu-ray back in the day).  I assume if you are here,  you are already familiar with JLS.  The film was released in 1973 on the crest of the books phenomenal popular wave in pop culture.  I ennoble cinematic adaptations that where filmed in the era of their popularity, such as ""Godspell"" and ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" which immortalized Yvonne Ellimen's embodiment of Mary Magdalene. Unlike ""Hair"" which was produced some years later, after it's palpable cultural relevance began to transcend into nostalgic iconic status - I offer not as criticism (I enjoy the film version of ""Hair""), but as a differentiation.

For Jonathan Livingstone Seagull, I offer an appreciation and acknowledgment of a culturally significant cinematic effort that capsulizes the consciousness of an era.

I loved the film.

The Odyssey of Jonathan Livingston Seagull is navigated by James Franciscus impelling magnanimous vocal performance accompanied by Neil Diamond's inspired score, and actuated by breath-taking visuals and contemporary special effects presented artistically, ingeniously, and efficiently.
If made today, although technologically capable of being proficiently anthropomorphically superior, it would lose the comportment of 1973. Although a praiseworthy first viewing of the film, I nostalgically yearned to be only revisiting the cinematic experience.
If you loved JLS then, you'll treasure JLS now.",1443398400,11,1767,5.212014134275618

In an age of religious literalism, vying for dominance in our culture with materialism, this wonderful tale needs to be retold visually. Employing all the technology, audio and video, available to current film making.

What could not be achieved in 1973 via film technology, could now be brought to bear on this epic story. A whole new audience awaits this stirring fable. And an anxious audience of baby-boomers, who remember the original, deeply inspirational story.

8594046,5,B00DJYKDHE,"For the first time ever in his career making movies, Hall Bartlett knew exactly what he was doing. He was adapting a best-selling novella by Richard Bach about a prophetic seagull, and he was going to turn it into a major motion picture. It was going to be an independently-financed film with as little studio interference as possible. And by the end of the ten-month shooting schedule, Bartlett had mortgaged his home and invested every last one of his savings into the films $1.5 million budget; he was willing to do anything to make his dream project a reality. I was born to make this movie, he declared. He was absolutely right.

Hall Bartlett (1923-1993) was one of Hollywoods most underrated writer/directors. He wrote and directed ten feature films: Unchained (1955), Drango (1957), Zero Hour! (1957), All the Young Men (1960), The Caretakers (1963), Changes (1969), The Sandpit Generals (1971), The Children of Sanchez (1978) and Love is Forever (1983). Some of his films were bland studio projects, while the others had intriguing concepts but were often unsatisfyingly executed. In his entire 30-year filmmaking career, Bartlett helmed a series of flops, misfires, close calls, small gems, and at least one masterpiece: Jonathan Livingston Seagull (1973).

Richard Bachs enormously popular 1970 book had first come to Bartletts attention after he read it in a barbershop. The timing couldn't have been better; after the critical and commercial failure of his hospital drama The Caretakers in 1963, Bartlett had watched his career devolve. Ive been through about ten years of hell, he told an interviewer on the set, up until very, very recently, where everything went wrong. I couldn't make a right move. The fear was on me that I would never make a picture again then came a woman with such love to share, and then Jonathan, and suddenly everything was right.

Bartlett had hoped that, with Jonathan Livingston Seagull, he would finally get the attention he deserved. Nobody ever once realized that the film he was making was very, very ahead of its time.

The film was absolutely reviled when it came out. Reviews were terrible. The sort of garbage only a seagull could love, wrote Judith Crist. Interminable, said Art Murphy in Variety. Bird droppings! snorted Jay Cocks in Time magazine. Strictly for the birds, quipped Frank Rich in the New Times. And in a particularly negative 1-star review, Roger Ebert was perhaps the most scathing of all: This has got to be the biggest pseudocultural, would-be metaphysical ripoff of the year.

The reviews hurt the movies commercial chances significantly; at the box office, it grossed only $1.6 million, just short of the $2.1 million Paramount had spent to purchase the film from Bartletts studio. And five years later, Harry Medved and Randy Dreyfuss excessively panned it in their 1978 book The Fifty Worst Movies of All Time (a book which also trashed such titles as Sam Peckinpahs ""Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia"" and Richard Donner's ""The Omen""). So drenched in vile cynicism was their review that Medved and Dreyfuss even mocked Bartlett for making his picture in the true auteur fashion, as if they considered themselves superior to a filmmaker who had spent all his savings on a personal project they had not even bothered to try to comprehend.

Jonathan Livingston Seagull is one of my all-time favorite American movies, and I hasten to say that because the horrid reception that this film received during its releaseand ever since thenhas angered me to no end over the years. There is no reason why this film should have flopped as it did. There is no reason why this film should have been dismissed as quickly as it was. As far as I can tell, nobody gave this movie a chance. Nobody was willing to appreciate Hall Bartletts directorial vision or take him seriously as a filmmaker. Not one review mentioned anything nice about the films story or technique. Everybody walked in with a closed mind, completely unwilling to embrace the movies unique perspective. Ebert proudly began his review by announcing that he walked out of the film some 45 minutes into it, but then ended his review by revealing that he had left during the sequence in which Jonathan had dragged himself, groggy and bleeding, onto some flotsam. Judging from the actual running time, it appears as though Ebert must have, in fact, walked out of the screening approximately 21 minutes into the film.

Then there were the lawsuits. Richard Bach sued Bartlett when Bartlett refused to honor Bach's right to final cut. Neil Diamond threatened to sue Bartlett if he didn't incorporate more of the music from the soundtrack into the film; Diamond was also upset when composer Lee Holdridge requested to share credit with Diamond over the music. Ovady Julber, the director of 1936s La Mer, sued over suspicions that Bartletts film might have plagiarized his work.

And toes were stepped on. Associate Producer Leslie Parrish had worked hard to hire the crew members and help take care of the real seagulls being used for the production (these seagulls were trained by Ray Berwick and Gary Gero, and stored in a room in a Holiday Inn), but in the end, Bartlett demoted Parrish's credit from Associate Producer to ""Researcher"".

In spite of the tension which occurred behind the scenes, Jonathan Livingston Seagull belongs right up there with Stanley Kubricks 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) as one of the great surrealist films released in the later half of the 20th century. It is a rich, liberated celebration of a writer/directors artistic sensibilities, free of any constricting narrative rules. Like those aforementioned films, it expands even more in dimension with repeated viewings. What Hall Bartlett did with Jonathan Livingston Seagull is special: he recognized the visual opportunities in Bachs storya story that was always heavily cinematic to begin withthus allowing him to adapt it into a visually powerful cinematic experience that offers images quite like nothing ever produced before or since.

The film even has the audacity to open with the dedication that appeared on the first page of Bachs novella: To the real Jonathan Livingston Seagull, who lives within us all. These words appear as onscreen text that burst in bright blue hues alongside an opening shot of white clouds, enhanced with the help of the cinematography by helicopter photographer Jim Freeman and veteran cinematographer Jack Couffer (the latter of whom was hired after his impressive work on Walt Disneys True Life Adventure series). One is simply amazed by the sensational aesthetic effect of Bartletts film, from his explosive footage of crashing tidal waves to his unbelievable tracking shots of the films title characterwhether he be flying above the clouds, near the rocky shores or into the cores of deserts and snowy mountains. That Couffers cinematography netted the film one of two Academy Award nominations is not surprising in the least: it remains one of the finest examples of natural footage ever captured on celluloid.

Getting that footage was sometimes dangerous. Couffer was allegedly attacked by one of the seagulls during filming, prompting Bartlett to have his crew members wear baseball catchers masks in order to prevent further accidents. We get a good glimpse at just how vicious the seagulls were during filming in one of the movies first sequences, which provides us with a glimpse of seagull life. As a tugboat sits out in the middle of the ocean, dumping piles of fish into the water, hordes of seagulls begin fighting all at once for the rotten, filthy chum. In a sequence marvelously edited by Frank P. Keller and James Galloway (thus netting the film its second Oscar nomination), the seagulls bite, claw, gnash and bloody each others throats; if this continues, we fear, they may start decapitating each other. Its an ugly, hostile, disgusting existence, and thats why we sigh a breath of relief when we are suddenly whisked away into the skywhere we take the point of view of a figure bursting its way through the clouds. Then we see what it is: a lone seagull. An independent. Thats him. Thats Jonathan.

Jonathan is voiced by James Franciscus, that suave, handsome actor who starred in Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) and in Dario Argentos The Cat o Nine Tails (1971). In his day, Franciscus was an irresistible ladies man, a Rod Serling look-a-like and a fitting Apes replacement for Charlton Heston. But Hall Bartlett must have recognized that there was something oddly appealing about Franciscus voice, a voice which sometimes tended to sound hoarse and monotone. That proved to be the perfect fit for the voice of Jonathan, who is quieter and more observant in the later scenes of Jonathan Livingston Seagull but who has a boyish squeal in his voice in the earlier scenesas he struggles to determine the secret to perfect speed. Jonathan's problem is that he too often lets his doubts control his destiny and, whats more, lets fear get in the way of his ambition. Maybe seagulls cant fly faster than 62 miles per hour, he considers. But wouldnt it be great if we could?

His parents are not pleased. Mother (Dorothy McGuire) fears for his safety: Im afraid for you. Im afraid of what you're doing. Father (Richard Crenna) is even less helpful: We were meant to live the way we liveaccept it! Take your place. Will you try, son? Yet Jonathan continues to be interrupted with inspired revelations. What if he were to dive, for example, on the wingtips only? This results in one of the films genuinely funniest moments, when Jonathan hits 170 at the short dive but then disastrously attempts to dive at 10,000 ft, loses control, spirals into oblivion and screams, OH GOD, THE FLOCK LOOK OUT!!!!! But then Bartlett segues into a scene that is not so funny, as Jonathan is forced to stand trial before the head Elder (Hal Halbrook), who is cruelly unforgiving to the young independent. Jonathan Livingston Seagull, the brotherhood is broken! the Elder roars. Never again will you see any of your Flock! Never again will you have the protection of your Flock! You are henceforth and forever outcast! Thrown out by the Flock, the Elders and even his own parents, Jonathan has gone from a social deviant to something that is even worse: a bastard.

This is where one of the directors key themes as a filmmaker comes into place. Bartlett loved to make films about illegitimate children disowned by their parents. Think of Janis Paiges speech in The Caretakers, in which she sobs about being taunted as a little bastard all her life. Or Anthony Quinns final monologue in The Children of Sanchez, in which he condemns all of his children as bastards during a spoiled picnic dinner. In contrast, Jonathan Livingston Seagull deals with the theme of illegitimacy more subtlety. Outcast is substituted for bastard,"" and yet the term is no less painful. The sequence in which Jonathan departs for his life of solitude, set to the tune of Diamonds Lonely Looking Sky,"" is quite simply one of the saddest sequences of the 1970s, and it is all the more tragic if we realize, in hindsight, that Jonathan will never see his parents again. He will die without them at his side.

Neil Diamond and Lee Holdridges score for the film has often been dismissed as overbearing, but Ive always begged to differ. Among the other songs used on the soundtrack, Be represents Jonathans independence, while Dear Father epitomizes his self-doubt and Skybird, his liberation. To me, the film's soundtrack remains exhilarating, and it is also a reminder of Hall Bartletts often-overlooked talent for juxtaposing the right kind of music with his cinematic stories.

Bartletts masterful filmmaking is demonstrated even further in the 13-minute sequence that follows, in which Jonathan attempts to know all there is to know of this life and embarks on a long stretch, midway through the film, that takes him all the way to the ends of the Earth and, finally, to his death. All Bartlett does here is follow Jonathan while he flies from one habitat to another, as he observes fellow animals and keeps to himself; in fact, in the last 13 minutes of his life, Jonathan never says a word. There is no doubt in my mind that Bartlett must have been influenced by Kubrick in crafting this sequence, for it invites startling comparison to the famous Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite sequence from 2001. Like Dave Bowman, Jonathan passes through scene after scene of enchanting realms before settling into his own demise and, then, being reborn as a kind of supernatural being. From that point on, the film folds onto itself like a Chinese box, and suddenly its a new kind of film altogether.

At the time, the film was suspected by some critics to be an allegory for Christs suffering and resurrection; Time magazine claimed that Bartlett had tarnished Bachs story with Billygrahmese dialogue. Were these critics not paying much attention during the film? Listen carefully to the conversations between Jonathan and his mentor, Chiang (Philip Ahn), particularly their discussions about the afterlife. When Jonathan asks Chiang if they are in Heaven, Chiang simply replies, Who said it was? Heaven isn't a place. Heavens perfection, wouldnt you think? And we don't go there, as much as we express it. Or consider Jonathans conversations with Maureen (Juliet Mills), who asks him, Didnt you say you know me from somewhere? I believe there were many somewheres! Her comment, of course, implies reincarnation. In retrospect, the film is about as Christian as the Star Wars films; interestingly enough, Richard Bachs mythology of perfect speed predates George Lucas Force mythology by about seven years. But a story like Jonathan Livingston Seagull has more in common with something like, say, Buddhism, than it does with Christianity.

Furthermore, Jonathan, unlike Christ, does not fully understand the meaning of love. Chiangs parting words to Jonathan are literally, keep working on love. A truly allegorical Christian figure would have no need for this kind of advice. Jonathans romance with Maureen is also one of the more significant changes which Bartlett makes from Bachs novella. In the book, Jonathan is accompanied by a best friend, Sullivan, wholike one of Christs disciplesdoubts his masters success in the face of danger. By inventing the character of Maureen, however, Bartlett makes Jonathan more ""human,"" shall we say, not to mention more likely to give into temptations of the flesh. A case might be made that Maureen is supposed to represent Mary Magdalene, but surely the relationship between Jonathan and Maureen is far warmer than the relationship which Christ and Magdalene ever might have had together. And as Jonathan embarks on a journey to free his old flock, Maureens last words to him (Jonathan, go with my love) resonate beautifully without carrying a religious context of any kind. My guess is that Bartlett sensed audiences would warm up to the story somewhat more if he were to give the hero a love interest.

The films most obvious rejection of blind Christian ideals, however, occurs after Jonathan and his new apprentice, Fletcher Lynd Seagull (David Ladd), try to win over the cynicism of the Flock and are, instead, nearly swallowed alive by their outrage. To be sure, it is not an unexpected reaction: practically everybody in the movie assumes Jonathan is either a heavenly or a hellish force of nature. Fletcher believes he might be a Christ figure. The Flock's Elders believe hes the Devil. Jonathan dismisses all of these theories. In one scene, he chuckles over the rumor that hes oh, yes, yes, I know: the only Son of the Great Gull, I suppose. And the final request he makes of his apprentice is modest, indeed: Dont let them spread silly rumors about me or try to make me some sort of a god, will you, Fletcher? Clearly, Jonathan considers himself to be just like every other seagull, just as Richard Bach believes there is a Jonathan who lives within us all.

And so, for that matter, did Hall Bartlett. He believed enough in this story to pour his heart and soul into it, confidant every step of the way that he was on the verge of completing an important film. Jonathan Livingston Seagull was not embraced by critics or audiences, but I have a feeling that Bartlett himself always knew, deep down, that he had left the public with a masterpiece. Maybe he knew that he wouldnt live to see the film get the attention it deserved. Maybe he was aware that the films mediocre reception would outlive him. After this film, he would only go on to make two films, The Children of Sanchez and Love is Forever. Neither was particularly impressive.

But I wish he were alive to know how much I love this film. I wish he knew how much it has changed the way I look at movies. And I wish he knew how much I cherish the way he ends the picture with Jonathans immortal closing monologue: Look with your understanding. Find out what you already know. Use it, Fletcher. Teach it show it forth. And youll know the way to fly.",1485216000,2,17069,4.919791666666667
