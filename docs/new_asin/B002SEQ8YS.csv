3980925,5,B002SEQ8YS,"My daughter loves animals and we would often watch NatGeo shows, but they are slow paced, we did not get a lot of facts, and many times too violent for her. These are perfect as they show numbers, compare shapes, have maps. There is no violence and just enough humor to make her laugh. There are tests within the show. I even learn a lot! I will buy more of these.",1345248000,7,364,4.140845070422535
3980926,4,B002SEQ8YS,"My 7 year-old enjoyed this very much.  It's super kid-safe.  She used to more in-depth animal videos, but she was still entertained.  It had some key classification facts, and lots of fun facts, too.",1330214400,7,199,4.794117647058823
3980927,5,B002SEQ8YS,"very educational regarding the facts about animals, but not too much of the real life eating or killing.  Also not too centered on animals going extinct (which many animal videos are nowadays).  A good informational and fun video for kids (mine are ages 5 and 7).  My son thinks that most kid movies (including barbie, disney, or anything else with a ""bad guy"") are scary, but he loves these animal atlas videos.",1293580800,21,412,4.694444444444445
3980928,5,B002SEQ8YS,"Bought this for my God Daughter and she really loves them, she mimics all the animal noises and will watch these videos over and over.",1403654400,,134,4.4
3980929,3,B002SEQ8YS,My son like this video some but the narrator speaks too fast and the video jumps from picture to picture too quickly.,1403568000,,117,4.363636363636363

3980932,4,B002SEQ8YS,My kids enjoyed this movie.  The watched it once and have asked to watch it again.  My 5 year old son liked the voice overs at the end of each episode.  It was a little strange that it is actually several episodes of a tv show.  I didn't expect that.  But overall it was fun for the kids.,1376092800,,288,3.896551724137931
3980933,4,B002SEQ8YS,"My kids liked the DVD.  They enjoyed learning about the different animals and the little questions after the animals helped reinforce what they just heard.  I liked the fact that they used real footage of the animals because kids are so used to seeing animated versions of the animals.  Overall, a good DVD with great educational value.  I will probably buy a few more of this series.",1372291200,,384,4.686567164179104
3980934,5,B002SEQ8YS,"Very informative video. Good structured and interactive presentation about interesting facts of animal's super sizes or super abilities. All our family was enjoin to watch it, and didn't hesitate to see it second time together with little one. This is nice family video.",1367452800,,270,5.3023255813953485
3980935,3,B002SEQ8YS,"I was a little let down with this  because it was clear that they use the same shots from various zoos over and over.  Also the information overlaps a lot. With that said, my 6 year old has enjoyed watching it though I think she will outgrow it quickly.",1366243200,,253,4.142857142857143
3980936,5,B002SEQ8YS,The grandchildren ages 2 and 5 loved it. They keep asking to watch it and it is very educational.  Parents would love their kids to watch it.,1366156800,,141,4.222222222222222
3980937,3,B002SEQ8YS,"I should have listened to the reviews that I read that said the
animals were in zoos.  Grandkids did not like it.",1365811200,,113,4.136363636363637

8379373,5,B002SEQ8YS,Interesting and informative. Kept my 2.5 year old interested through the whole show time. Love that she is watching something informative and not just another entertaining cartoon. There was a mini quiz after each segment which is more suitable for an older child (maybe a 6 year old can understand?). Great DVD. Will consider buying another one from the same range,1419984000,,365,5.0
