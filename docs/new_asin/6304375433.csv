861372,3,6304375433,"When I saw this movie a found it a laugh a minute! It was like an east coast person's view of what life must be like in the Pacific Northwest.  We don't all wear flannal shirts, drink beer in bars, listen to country-western, brawl, work as loggers and chew tobacky!  Wow, did they ever get it wrong! I am from Gresham Oregon and had a front row seat (the Portland area had about the best view of this in the world.)  May 18, 1980 was a beautiful day, not a cloud in the clear blue sky and I watched that mountain spew its contents all day long.  No movie can ever capture it.  The only thing I think I will never forget is that and seeing the ash cloud traveling east as far as the eye can see.  Oh, the movie?  Just watch it for fun, it's harmless, unlike the real deal.",1050019200,9,771,4.032894736842105
861373,3,6304375433,"This film follows the familiar disaster scenario: gifted scientist comes to small town where he is sure a horrible natural disaster is about to happen; he warns the citizenry but his cautions are rejected by the  establishment (fear for tourist or manufacturing or whatever dollars);  cataclysm occurs and hero is vindicated; often leading character(s) perish;  finally disaster (volcano, meteor, shark, flood, whatever) effects  occur.
This plot outline could describe St. Helens, Dante's Peak, Jaws,  and a bunch of other films. In the present film, however, it is used to  good effect to describe the very real eruption of Mt. St. Helens in  Washington State, and along the way gives an interesting accounting of the  life and death of Harry Truman, noted St. Helen's character. The movie's  strengths lie in its portrayals of the actual events surrounding the  volcanic eruptions; its weaknesses occur with the invented characters of  the scientist and his love interest.
As a citizen of Washington State  with a love for disaster films, I have watched this film numerous times and  enjoyed it. I would really recommend it.",952560000,34,1127,5.194444444444445

It's a old movie from the 80s that was no big Hollywood production and can be bought anywhere else for five to fifteen dollars. Here it's just a big rip off.,1441065600,,286,3.864406779661017

861489,5,6304375433,"This is as close as it gets to being around a volcano when it is both about to erupt and when it actually does erupt. Having lived out in Washington State near Mt. St. Helens brings a certain ""realness"" to the movie.",1391904000,4,216,4.166666666666667
861490,1,6304375433,I saw this movie when I was teenager and I've always been fascinated with Mt. St Helens. My grandparents lived in Portland Oregon when it erupted. They collected ash from there own home and sent it to me. I was very disappointed with this DVD edition (30th Anniversary Edition). Very poor quality and the swear words were all bleeped out. Art Carney did a wonderful job acting but it wasn't fun to watch with all his lines being bleeped. I don't recommend this edition. I will try to find another edition of this movie that is complete.,1381190400,7,536,4.536082474226804
861491,5,6304375433,"Yes, this is sort of a B movie, and virtually unknown, unless you are a former Oregonian like myself. But it is well done, with thoughtful characters and circumstances. I lived in Bend (where it was filmed) and lived through the St Helen's debacle, so to me this film is like going home. Worth buying for the endearing lead characters and exciting story line. Although, I think they took liberties with Harry Truman, I lived this saga, and don't remember the real Harry being so nasty! By the way, I also love Dante's Peak, and feel they used this movie, (St Helen's) which came first, as a basic format of reference in working out a generic version of a similar event. Both films are worth owning.",1374192000,,698,4.5476190476190474

This movie did such a great job of telling the true story of what happened, and the people involved. A really good true story about such a huge happening. I really recommend. Just a after thought, the DVD bleeps out the curse words",1371340800,,406,4.426666666666667

861532,5,6304375433,"My husband first owned ""St. Helens"" on VHS (he loves disaster films).  When we started dating, he wanted to share this movie with me.  I fell in love with the interpretation of this true live event.  I grew up when Mt. St. Helens erupted.  This movie tells the story of local citizens and scientists.  There is of course a love story mixed in there, along with the humor of Art Carney (a citizen who refuses to evacuate).  This movie is well-written, and includes some of the actual footage of the eruption.  To be clear, it also includes a great 70's vibe (some cheesy parts) with some old-school country/western music.  If you like classic, well-told stories, you will like this film.  That is why we had to own in on DVD after we wore out the VHS copy. Enjoy!",1355875200,,762,4.463768115942029

861567,5,6304375433,"I was born in Seattle and living there when St. Helen's erupted. I don't remember much but seeing the big billowing ash cloud in the sky and someone giving me some ash from the volcano, which I thought was interesting.

I remember watching this movie with my Mom when I was a kid and I have always been intrigued by real life event movies.

I was so excited to find this on DVD. Although trying to pass the torch to MY kids, they have zero interest in this movie.

This movie is truly interesting and I thoroughly enjoy Art Carney's character.",1335484800,,543,4.356435643564357

This is the movie were the WHOLE ENTIRE SIDE of the mountain (MT.ST.Helens) blows out while a guy (Art Carney) is on the lake in a little boat. The whole town has been warned by a guy to leave but few listen. One of the best true story movies I have EVER seen.,1335312000,,355,4.014084507042254

861571,4,6304375433,"I first saw this movie on cable not long after it's release. The movie is not particularly accurate historically, but Art Carney's characterization of Harry Truman, makes the film. For those of us living in sight of Mt. Ranier, another semi-active volcano, it makes for a thought provoking movie.

I love trivia so I'll share a few intriguing facts that I've read:  Washington state has cornered the U.S. market on volcanos, we have five active ones. Geologists predict Mt. Ranier will blow catastrophically in the foreseeable future (1 chance in 6, during our lifetime). The lahar (a Hawaiian word), is an avalanche of mud and ash which will race down the nearby Nisqually river valley at freeway speed. Not if mind you...when. Reaching south Seattle, the lahar will erase a quarter of a million people and there may be no warning whatsoever. One geologist was quoted saying that of all the worlds volcanos, it's Mt. Ranier that scares him most. Yikes! It's no wonder we have to take the lessons of Mt. St. Helen seriously.

Movies about apocalyptic event's have always held a facination for most of us. Just ignore the fictionalized stuff and focus on the true events. This movie does a pretty good job of that. One thing to note, this film has a slightly soft focus and muddy colors. Almost certainly, it's a second or third generation print. Also, there were several scenes in the film where I could hear annoying flaws in the soundtrack. Fortunately, these were fairly infrequent.",1294531200,3,1485,4.861660079051384
861572,4,6304375433,"I enjoyed the unique and unforgettable pleasure of meeting Harry Truman during a family trip to Wasington State in 1967.  Here was a man who dearly loved his life and the commanding volcano, Mount St. Helens, which provided the stunning backdrop for his modest cabin and boat rental service.  My family and I were treated to a motorboat ride on the mountain's nearby Spirit Lake, with Mr. Truman as our personal guide.  We briefly spotted a bald eagle perched atop a towering fir.  At that moment, Harry stated with pride and wonder how he never failed to see ""something different"" every time that he looked at the mountain and its surroundings.

God only knows what Harry Truman's last thoughts were when St. Helens finally erupted in 1980, but it is certain that he never regretted remaining with his cabin, even after most of the area's residents had been strongly advised to evacuate.  Ultimately, death with the mountain was far preferable to Harry than living without it.

Well, you do not necessarily need to visit that particular area of the great Northwest to fully appreciate the magnitude of one man's devotion to his country.  Simply allow the highly skilled actor, Art Carney, to tell you the story.  This moving film accomplishes everything that it set out to portray.  It's not a documentary, nor is it a travelogue feature or flamboyant portrait of an heroic American.  ""St. Helens"" is merely (and perfectly) the account of a kind but determined gentleman who was as integral to his landscape as were the trees, or Spirit Lake, or the embracing mountain itself.",1291420800,5,1577,4.868913857677903

861613,4,6304375433,"I recorded this movie in 1990 when I was 14 and watched it over and over again, loved it, it was my favorite. It is sad, but they add a touch of humor to it. I recorded it on a cheap grainy VHS tape and I think it got tossed out. I would like to own it on DVD but I would like to know WHY is it so doggoned expensive? A lot of people say it was a crummy, shoddy movie and I guess so, (I have not seen it in maybe 15 years) so why so expensive??? I would like to own it.

It is also well acted.",1229299200,,308,3.796875
861615,5,6304375433,"Take my word for it, I have not found any other movie whose content deals with the eruption of Mt St Helens except this one and thank god the late Art Carney was in this or it probably would have only gotten 3 stars from me just for the build up to the eruption alone but his comedic jabs at the right moments made it all the more enjoyable to watch.  It's another one of those pictures thats based upon fact but no doubt has some fiction interwoven into it in some spots, it's not the best volcano movie I have seen but it is by far NOT THE WORST...I gave it 5 stars because I truly liked all 90 minutes of this movie.

A scientist (david Huffman) is called to the mountain after a series of earthquakes rock the region and after several readings and experiments determines that the mountain is going to blow but of course no one believes him.  But he does get support from the mountains steadfast occupant, Harry Truman (Carney) who refuses to leave the ol' girl even tho' he knows he'll get blown to kingdom come if it blows.

Huffman's Character was, in real life, david Johnston, who was 5 miles from the volcano's north face when it blew and was buried in the inital lateral blast of the eruption.  His body was never found.  An observatory in his name was built southeast of the volcano and, today, houses the Mt St Helens volcano Web Cam, if you google MT ST HELENS VOLCANO WEB CAM, you will find the site.",1209945600,12,1414,4.296992481203008

861617,1,6304375433,"This movie completely disrespects the people living in and among the areas of Mt St Helens.  The only thing that's good about it is that you get to see the beautiful Pacific Northwest.  Art Carney does a fair job of portraying the salty Harry Truman, but if this is based on a true story, why didn't they use David Johnston's real name?  This film does not do justice to being there -- watching my friends' houses float down the river, having two inches of ash spread like snow all over the landscape, having to wear masks for weeks to prevent inhaling it, listening to the radio wondering if they found my sister's teacher, which they never did.  We Pacific Northwesterners were all deeply affected by this experience.  The least the film makers could have done was an accurate presentation of the facts ... names included.",1182988800,5,824,4.655172413793103
861618,5,6304375433,A very believable movie of the events of the Mount. St Helen's eruption. I ordered it for my Mother and had a chance to watch it. Now I will get a copy.

861621,5,6304375433,"I thought a word or two from a guy who was running through the flying simulated ash while cameras rolled in downtown Bend, Oregon might help you enjoy this great movie even more. The producers decided on Bend for the fall 1980 filming because of the resemblance to Cougar, Washington which was the real life town near Mount Saint Helens. The ash you see flying in the movie as people scramble to safety is actually Bentonite shoveled in front of a large gas driven fan, I remember having to squint as my real life 4 year old son and I scurried through a makeshift swap meet supposedly fleeing the eruption. Set back with your popcorn and watch vehicles flip and collide, fireballs overtake cars trying to flee, and the old stubborn mountain man Harry Truman, not the President, played by Art Carne arguing his point with experts over why he should stay at his secluded mountain cabin in spite of the imminent danger. Awesome! I also set idle in line, setting in my blue VW Squareback for what seemed like hours waiting for welders to fabricate a small launching ramp to flip a car in an intersection.

 I recommend this movie because it builds great suspense as the dedicated scientist David Jackson, played by David Huffman studies the mountain as it continually rumbles and bulges with tremendous pressure build-up, and ends with some very sobering facts about the power of nature and the consequences of ignoring official warnings and restricted areas. It's actually quite educational. Be sure to see this entertaining semi-docudrama, and look for this then 23 year old Oregonian in a brown patch leather vest running from right to left with my own 8 mm camera and case around my shoulder, I had originally traveled the 10 miles to town to film a movie being filmed and ended up in it, I still have that memorable home movie footage. My son was nearby, but it's pretty tough to spot him on screen unless you pause and search. THINK I'LL GO WATCH IT NOW FOR OLD TIME SAKE. Happy watching!",1152489600,5,1990,4.666666666666667

7869850,4,6304375433,"The movie itself is very 1980's drama, hairstyles and mannerisms. One of those time-capsule movies. I like the story of the Mt. St. Helens explosion and I remember it well. So the story is interesting to me. Much of it is accurate, with the embellishment of poor scientific community predictions driven by political muscle. Some corny side stories, but 70-80's movies were like that. Art Carney is entertaining as the local knows-everything and the guy who wouldn't leave the mountain.

In this version, Rated PG-13 (pay attention) there are NO censorship BEEPs which makes it a much better version than the other 30th Anniversary Edition available today. Remember, what was considered offensive language in movies and TV back then is WAY more tame than what passes today.",1472342400,2,772,5.078740157480315
