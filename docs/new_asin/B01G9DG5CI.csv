7759139,4,B01G9DG5CI,Four stars might seem too much but the acting in this movie was top notch.  The storyline was interesting and it carries you through to the end.  I loved this and found it to be charming as well.  Bishop and Billy were great as best friends and comic relief.,1469836800,2,258,4.224489795918367

7759141,4,B01G9DG5CI,"And I say surprisingly cause you wouldn't expect a sequel made 40(ish) years later to be this good. It certainly is better than the sequels made to cult classics like Silent Night, Bloody Night and The Killer Shrews.
The cast was great too. The effects well done. The movie looks great. It doesn't have the same awesome finale the original had  and it was pretty obvious which of the doctors was the evil one from the moment it is introduced so that's why I rate 4 out of 5.
Recommended to fans of the original and those who enjoy low budget Horror film.",1469404800,7,554,4.378640776699029
7759142,4,B01G9DG5CI,"""Don't Look in the Basement 2"" is a pleasant surprise for those who have seen (and have some degree of fondness for) the original.  In a rare turn, it is actually a sequel that builds on the first film, incorporating elements of the supernatural, whilst providing enough quick cut flashbacks to educate the novice viewer as well.  The performances are good, the story is surprisingly okay but admittedly stretched thin (and I say this because there wasn't too much to work with in the original), a few of the characters are very well drawn, and the movie is quite enjoyable.  Written and directed by the son of the director of the original adds a touch of class to an obvious labor of love.  Definitely give this one a shot.  Despite a meager budget, this film comes across as rather glossy and professional.  An all around solid accomplishment.",1468195200,7,845,4.714285714285714
7759143,2,B01G9DG5CI,"Contains a revealing character PLOT SPOILER.

This is a sequel that comes 44 years later. The film includes some flashbacks and you get the basic idea should you not want to watch the first film over again. Dr. William Mathews (Andrew Sensenig) joins the staff of a sanitarium he did not realize was the one in the first film. Emily (Camilla Carr) the director, brings back Sam (Willie Minor) a survivor from the massacre. When he shows up weird things begin to happen.

PLOT SPOILER: Camilla Carr was in the first film as Harriet. In this film she was the character Charlotte from the first film. Sam was played by the late William Bill McGhee in the initial feature. The basement is mentioned at 45 minutes into the feature and they do actually go into it and  they leave enough characters alive for another sequel in 2060.

This is not a great sequel, although it does seem to keep with the facts in the first film. For those who want to add two shiny discs to their collection of horror have this selection.

It was OK but the scenes with the black character were good and when he starts crying after the climax actually made me start top tear up, now if only the rest of the movie was as brutal nd well written as that scene and the ending montage with him.

7759157,2,B01G9DG5CI,"The name of this movie should be,'Don't Watch This"".  I love cheesy thrillers and this one had its moments, but  it was more of a slap stick comedy. than a scary movie.",1503187200,,168,4.21875
7759158,5,B01G9DG5CI,"I'm grading this on a curve. It's obviously not as good as The Godfather, Rocky, Star Wars, Dr. Strangelove or any other Hollywood made classic. I'm considering this a B Grade Horror Movie and reviewing it as such. Compared to so, so many other cheapo horror films of the past 15 or so years this one stands out as a diamond in the rough.
This was directed by the son of the director of the original ""Don't Look In The Basement"". It is not a reboot (soft or otherwise), a re-imagining or any other current Hollywood buzz word that generally means garbage. (Think of the new versions of Ghostbusters, Fright Night, Night Of the Demons, The Fog, etc. and you'll see what I mean.)
This is a true sequel to the original. And it's really great as it captures the feeling of the original while still being modern enough to interest younger viewers. I wasn't even born when the original came out but it became one of my favorite B Horror movies.
It has a great story with interesting, well written characters and a cool story that shows love for the original. The camera work and directing are top notch and the actors do a fine job.
This one follows up the original film beautifully. I won't go in to a plot synopsis as that is covered above. But I will say this is most definitely worth watching.
Also, you should check out the original first, which is available to watch for free for Prime members.",1501372800,3,1394,4.44921875
7759159,5,B01G9DG5CI,"Okay, that was not supposed to happen. I did not expect, nor did I think this movie was going to be as good as it is. The entire cast did an outstanding job, especially the orderly's. I definitely recommend , ""Don't look in the Basement 2"" to anyone interested in a very good, very surprising B Horror / comedy / suspense / _ _ _ _, ok, I won't ruin the ending so if you don't already have PRIME, then the few dollars it takes to rent this will be more than worth it. I am definitely adding this to my movie collection.",1492214400,3,519,4.048543689320389
7759160,4,B01G9DG5CI,"I'd seen the original numerous times in double and triple features back in the day. I think a lot more thought went into the sequel than the original film, which seemed haphazardly thrown together. The sequel was filmed in the same building as the original and it was a welcome return, it is almost a character in itself. All of the colorful crazies from the original are back, in a way, and the most memorable character from the first film ""Sam"" returns and drives the story. The sequel has professional production values and looks great. This film knew exactly what it had to be and was executed perfectly. It was goofy and corny one minute and then suspenseful and genuinely scary in the next. It did feature a few gory bits and some nice plot twists in the final act. This sequel was surely a labor of love and it far exceeds the ambitions of the original film. It made me want to go back and watch the original and the sequel in a double feature.",1487980800,,951,4.409090909090909

The opening sequence sucks you immediately in with views of the brutally slain that BTW are first class special effects. An added creep bonus is the flies that keep landing in the bloody muck. The music is perfect and perfectly scary. Beautifully shot and kudos to DP Chuck Hatcher. The actors are very impressive and memorable. What a cast of odd characters they assembled!

7759186,2,B01G9DG5CI,"Not bad for a free watch on Prime.

Things that I did like: the lighting, camerawork, editing and overall tone. Some of the actors were good (Dr. Matthews, Dr. White, Jennifer, a few of the patients, especially Millie). Pretty good directing.  Side note: Dr. White was CUTE! :)

Things that I did not like: pretty much any scene with Billy and Bishop (especially Billy...this guy was a HORRIBLE actor)...the scenes with them felt very disjointed, almost ""added in"" and out of place. They brought the movie to a screeching halt and were not as funny as they could have been. Roman was another bad actor. Some of the effects were pretty bad. Music was pretty generic sounding, too.

It's a rare movie that makes me want to share it instantly with others, but this one hit that. I think it's got the makings of a cult classic.",1471132800,4,513,4.711111111111111
