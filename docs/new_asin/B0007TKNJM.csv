Season 1 through4 are available in the us now season five is out in the uk,and season six comes out 04/06,in europe. As usual we have to look elseware to get the later seasons of tv shows.

8051575,5,B0007TKNJM,"In the 1960s we had the medical shows, ""Ben Casey"", ""Doctor Kildaire"", and ""Marcus Welby, MD"".

In the 1970s we had ""Medical Center"", ""The Bold Ones"", ""Quincy, ME"", and ""Trapper John, MD"", not to mention the daytime soap opera of that decade, ""The Doctors"".

In the 1980s, we had ""Saint Elsewhere"" & ""Doggie Howser, MD"".

In the 1990s, it was ""ER"".

""ER"" has been the staple of what great medical drama shows can be. It has set the standard for compelling stories each week and exciting drama during the 11+ years it's been on NBC. Ever since its premiere episode in September of 1993, it has continued a tradition of excellence in each and every storyline and it has enthralled viewers ever since. ""ER"" can boast serious talent in the writing, directing, casting, cimematography, and editing departments -- not to mention some breathtakingly gruesome special effects. In other words, top-notch television year after year and it shows in the list of Emmy and Golden Globe nominations. The series also has a lot of casting talent and these early seasons skyrocketed the careers of actors George Clooney, Julianna Margulies, Anthony Edwards, Noah Wyle, Eriq LaSalle, Gloria Reubens and Sherry Stringfield.

Created by popular writer Micheal Crichton and executive producers Steven Spielburg and John Wells, this show has the excitement of interesting characters and captivating stories.

Today in the 21st century, ""ER"" is still the staple of all medical shows. Those working on the series now stand atop the broad shoulders of those who came before them. The brilliance that has sparked over a decade of continual quality is particularly evident in these first three seasons.

5 out of 5 stars; no doubt about that!",1117238400,3,1714,5.035335689045937
