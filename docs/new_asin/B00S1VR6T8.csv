6947683,5,B00S1VR6T8,"Superb. Especially since a MI. Officer's Advance Course classmate of mine was one of the main commentators. I viewed it when aired and immediately purchased a DVD copy.  However, there was one tragic incident overlooked and that was the ""Orphan Baby Lift"" when one C-141 (?) went down trying to leave Saigon.",1433289600,4,308,4.923076923076923

8696895,2,B00S1VR6T8,"First, I only made it through the first section. I couldn't take any more. What the good reviews of this set are based on I've no idea. A friend of mine and I agreed that the narrative was so simplistic it might have been lifted from a high school textbook. Certain areas are glossed over while some events are presented melodramatically. Kennedy's is seen, with no detail, as pretty much pushing the war, and Johnson simply continuing what Kennedy started. There is much more to the situation, so much more that this idea is absurd. Not to nitpick, but Fort Worth is given as the place of Kennedy's assassination. I think that degree of non-attention to detail speaks to the value of this hurried mess. If you want to know more about the topic of Viet Nam and what led to it, spend a couple bucks on ""Secrets of War"", Oliver Stone's ""Untold History of the United States"", and watch the flawed but highly informative Ken Burns series. Do not waste even a few dollars on this. I donated my copy to the local library for anyone desperate for even trash history.",1531180800,,1059,4.520833333333333

8696898,2,B00S1VR6T8,"I haven't finished episode one yet because I'm still reeling from the news reported there that JFK was in fact murdered in Ft. Worth instead of Dallas as we have been led to believe all these years.
The reliability of anything they say going forward is suspect at best! Did anybody proofread the script or watch this film before it was released? Unbelievable.",1523750400,,359,4.714285714285714
