Basically it is a decent video. If you are looking for for lessons to give you solid Chicago blues don't get this video. The name is a bit misleading for most because people tend to think of 12 bar blues as Chicago and Delta Blues, but Dave focuses most of his attention on Jazzy Blues.  Now the Jazz does sound good but I am not particularly into Jazz.

Dave also spends too much time talking through the the Theory of why he is using the chords he is using.  Most guitarists don't understand theory to this depth (although we probably should:) )

There are a couple good blues shuffles and some decent licks on here but I would  get a used version and not spend money on a new copy.",1297900800,,759,4.129251700680272
8011536,4,B0001ENX7M,"I've bought many videos and books for guitar and I have to say this is certainly one of my favorites.  It's all well explained and fun to play with.  This is what good instruction should be.

Nothing here that a person couldn't learn if they apply themselves and everything is useful if you were to find yourself playing with people on the spot.  These are the basics of 12 bar progressions and we all need to know them.",1231718400,2,420,4.346153846153846
8011537,3,B0001ENX7M,"This DVD is not particularly well filmed. Nonetheless, this is certainly how I would like to be playing blues/jazz guitar in the not too distant future.

This DVD is a demonstration of various styles and techniques to be sure, but unless you are truly advanced, and I am not, it is of no value other than an end goal. It is not instructional in any way, shape or form. The other dvds on the subject I have purchased were instructional, took the time to explain the fingering etc. and learned with no trouble.

At the end of the day, this is the style I want to play but I am not going to be able to learn it from this dvd.

The fret markers on his guitar were square Gibson pearl inlays and inconsistent with most guitars and there dots, so trying to follow where he was on the fretboard at times was an exercise in frustration.

It is too bad really, because if he had taken the time to instruct versus demonstrate , and I am not making too fine a point of it believe me, it would have been first rate.

They would still have to clean up the video image and his finger nails on his fret hand were too long, obscuring the fingering most of the time. It was also too fast paced to be a learning tool.

Too bad, it could have been a winner.",1130284800,4,1238,4.1375
