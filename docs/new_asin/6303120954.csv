571769,5,6303120954,"This movie is from the gold plated age of Hard R (provocative in the 70s less than you see in PG-13 now.
Story: A decedent of Lady Chatterley finds the famous woman's diary and fantasizes as she reads.

the only reason to buy this film is to watch Harlee. She is agelessly adorable and all the goings on are mostly just for humor. I had such a crush on her in the 70s. that was back when I was a teenager but Im still fond of her. She married Richard Belzer in 1981, back when he was a comedian. He isn't much funny anymore but a decent actor and his character John Munch has appeared on several different shows across NBCs line up..",1387238400,,633,4.146341463414634

571877,4,6303120954,"If you were bored to tears by D.H. Lawrence's erotic literary classic Lady Chatterley's Lover and the 1981 film adaptation, you owe it to yourself to see Young Lady Chatterley. A staple of late-night premium cable channels in the early 80s, Young Lady Chatterley is the tale of the original Lady Chatterley's American niece, Cynthia, who inherits her aunt's fortune and English estate. Inspired by the lusty tales her aunt left in a hidden diary, Cynthia sets out on her own erotic affairs with the gardener and several other warm bodies before her none-the-wiser fiance arrives.

What makes it hot: The acting and storyline is very good by softcore standards. Leading lady Harley McBride is believable as a `good girl' discovering her sexuality and she isn't a product of plastic surgeons!

Memorable scene: Just for fun (and to offend her prudish limo driver), Cynthia picks up a hitchhiker and has a very hot backseat hook up with him as the driver looks on through the rear view mirror.

Memorable line: ""But I like gladiolus!""",1279929600,,1031,4.913793103448276
571878,1,6303120954,"The world of cinema does come in threes. For the past two weeks, films have come through my viewing palettes that have befouled my overall excitement for cinema. In a standard rut, one hopes that these final two films will prove otherwise, but keeping my fingers crossed will not be helpful. From nurses in love and an Americanized Harvey Keitel, nothing could have prepared me for the upcoming triumph known as ""Young Lady Chatterley"". Tagged as the first ""X-rated movie to touch you where it counts ... your heart"", one pleads with the DVD box to please allow some semblance of a story to push through the ""romps"" on the grass, but alas, my voice went unheard. This entry into the world of D.H. Lawrence's classic story proves that the naughty bits do make a film, and the late 70s were not afraid to experiment. With lush backgrounds, deepened British accents, and the downtrodden theme of finding an unbridled love free of boredom, ""Young Lady Chatterley"" attempts to mask the honesty that it is a softcore erotica film. It attempts to say that with these other elements thrown into the mix, we are not just your normal late-night darkened viewing, but instead something of some class and/or cult standing. As a reviewer of this film, one must look at both elements to examine if this film accomplished what it set out to do. How was production value? Was there a determined story? How were our characters? Because it is softcore erotica, should it not be placed within these same rules? While others will argue ""no"", ""Young Lady Chatterley"" is a film, and how does it rank among other films of this nature? Not to disappoint, but poorly.

Classical England would ask, ""Doth a scenery make strong erotica?"" While it seems the general reviewer of this film would agree, I had trouble seeing the production value or lush scenery in ""Young Lady Chatterley"". There wasn't anything that stood out, minimal sweeping wide shots, over-lighting throughout, and that soft camera filter that made the 70s what they are today were staples within this film. If anything, they were overused to the point of obscuring the actor's work. Leaning further towards the notion of softcore cinema than actual plot-induced cinema, we can look at our actors, to see what their production value was within this 1977 classic.  Harlee McBride, our lead and lady-in-waiting, begins bored, with both life and obviously this role, but as soon as she steps on our twice-removed-once-loved-Chatterley estate, the love and life begin to pour out of her - literally!  With everyone imaginable, she shares herself and takes into form an unrecognizable character.  Was she married to Phillip?  Was she just engaged?  How did it go from Phillip to every person at the estate?  The transition, like her character, just didn't fit.  She lacked that sexual manipulation that was needed to make this film into something more than just the overabundance of love.  There was no change in her or her character, we were handed nothing to begin with - and just expected to believe everything that occurred.  Poor direction by Alan Roberts lead to disinterested characters.  Not only with Harlee McBride, but also with everyone else.  The burly young gardener, the maids, the obviously oblique servants, everyone invited to the finale cake party - just seemed disjointed from the rest of the film.

With no strong characters, a plot that left nothing to the imagination or hope, there really was nothing left of ""Young Lady Chatterley"".  In fact, I am rather surprised that the Lawrence estate allowed the name to be used for this film.  What did stand out, as the only creativity within a mile, was the surrounding story of the first Lady Chatterley and her first run in with the gardener.  The character depth, the excitement of young love, and the passion that could not be surprisingly were all there for these brief sub-scenes.  The connection between the original lovers vs. that of the new ""Young"" version, was surprisingly different.  The first had purpose and meaning, while the other was just softcore dribble.  The conversations between the first Lady Chatterley and the gardener seemed responsive and open for discussion, giving at least one purpose to this film - while the rest, well, was utterly disappointing.

VIDEO:  The release of this DVD was not surprisingly sub-par compared to any newer restorations, other films (cult or otherwise) from the 70s get better treatment than this.  From the use of softcore to destroy a classic tale, this Alan Roberts film failed on nearly every level.

VISUAL:  Again, the 70s used quite a bit of techniques that continues to make this film feel like a 70s film.  The ending was horribly filmed, and the use of a couple of special effects (of which I mean the rain shower), was laughable.

SOUND:  Coincidentally, everything matched.  The sound went par with the visuals, creating an ambiance of 70s that will never pull ""Young Lady Chatterley"" into anything but a late night film view.

EXTRAS:  Surprisingly, they didn't skimp here.  The a-typical cast biographies that work as a page view, the jump to a scene, the posters of this film, and the other films available via Monterey Video are just packed in enough to perhaps call this a ""collectors"" edition, but would rather not.  Again, a plethora of extras with nowhere to go.

Overall, another milestone has been hit.  The third bad film in a row provides me with an opportunity to watch my first adult classic, but let's me down entirely.  The sub-stories was creative, but the rest of the film was meant for one sole purpose.  ""Young Lady Chatterley"" may have been pioneering for the time, but over the decades, it has just been forgotten and replaced.  There is a way to create a story like this and actually be artistic, but it was ignored in this film.  This wasn't a cult classic, it was just cinematic garbage.  The story didn't work, our characters were merely naked, and no development to anything was created.  While others boast the lush scenery as being a positive mark on this film, it just wasted time.  The soft-lens treatment of this film blurred away anything interesting from this film, and delivering another cinematic flop.

Grade: * 1/2 out of *****",1261699200,,6237,4.872985781990521
571879,4,6303120954,Great picture when I saw it as a VHS rental.  Think it was average running time of 95-100 minutes and think it was unrated.  All listing that I've seen say 141 minutes (which would be 2 hr 21 min.)  Think they probably meant 1 hr and 41 min (101 min) but would like to verify if it really might be a longer running time than 101 minutes. Can anyone verify?,1221177600,,356,4.057142857142857
571880,2,6303120954,"I tried to watch this movie as an Unbox download but the audio synch was so far out of whack it drove me to distraction.  I've watched enough poorly dubbed foreign flicks to have learned the trick of watching the actor's eyes instead of their lips, but that didn't help here.  While the camera, for example, is focused on the lovely star of the film speaking to another actor one hears a phone ringing and hears the star say hello, then the frame switches to the phone (apparently ringing) which is then picked up and moved to the star's face while....arrgghhh!  None of the reviews of the dvd I read mentioned this problem, so apparently it is just a Unbox issue, but since I use Unbox to preview movies I'm thinking of buying, this glitch will cost them a sale.",1203292800,2,763,4.435714285714286

571885,4,6303120954,"This 1977 softcore extravaganza is one of the finest and most erotic softcore films ever made.  Harlee McBride stars as Cynthia Chatterly, the title character of the film who after inheriting an estate decides to have sex with anything and everything that moves.  The big shock of the film isn't the sex, it's the fact that the storyline is great for a softcore film, and the acting is as well.  McBride and the chambermaids make this worth watching alone, and those who dig the good 'ol days of late night premium cable porn will love this classic.",1040083200,32,549,4.639175257731959
571886,5,6303120954,"""Young Lady Chatterley"" is a goofy, smarmy, tongue-in-cheek classic of late 1970's soft-core porn. The movie stars a pre-breast-augmentation Harlee McBride (a.k.a. Mrs. Richard Belzer, Detective John Munch on NBC cop shows) as Cynthia Chatterley, the niece of Lady Constance Chatterley (the main character of the D.H. Lawrence book). After Cynthia inherits her late aunt's English estate, she leaves the big city to explore it for herself. Once there, she has sex with just about everything that moves... the chambermaids, a hitchhiker, visitors to her house, all culminating in a large gangbang-type orgy centered around a Victorian costume party.
The movie is tongue-in-cheek throughout. None of the actors (including Peter Ratray as the gardener with whom Cynthia conducts her frequent sexual liaisons) seem to be taking the material seriously, but this adds to the overall ambience of the film. Producer-Director Alan Roberts (who also helmed the lesser 1985 sequel, ""Young Lady Chatterley II"") keeps the camera away from possible revealing shots, and except for one early sex scene (in a flashback sequence), there is no frontal nudity.
Overall, in the world of great 70's soft-core porn, this ranks as a classic and guilty pleasure. Although tomboyish, Harlee McBride exudes raw sexuality and eroticism, especially in her strongest scene, in which she has graphic intercourse with a hitchhiker while riding in the back of a car. Unlike the 1985 sequel, McBride still has natural breasts and a non surgically-altered body, so we can believe she's really an heiress to a beautiful, sprawling English estate, and just not another porn star. I recommend watching the unrated version, which is available on this DVD.
Undoubtedly, many of you will remember seeing this film and its sequel on American cable TV networks in the late 1980's, which was when I first saw it. If so, this DVD will bring back memories of late-night classic porn on HBO and other networks. The DVD has a nostalgic feel to it, and the presentation is nice. Overall, this is a good, sexy movie for connoisseurs of the genre.",1034640000,114,2097,5.152492668621701
