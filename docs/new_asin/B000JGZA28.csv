2670582,4,B000JGZA28,"I had a really hard time finding a movie that was appropriate for a toddler and accurately represented the Christmas story. There are so many kid Christmas shows/movies that are about a snowman, reindeer or Santa, but I wanted my 2.5 year old to understand what Christmas was really about.  She sat through the entire movie with me and I did help explain some things.  The movie is definitely low budget, but it is a sweet movie and is biblical accurate, in my opinion.  At the end of the movie, she put a hat on her head and white socks on her hands and said, ""I am an angel praising God"" and proceeding to sing songs.  I would say that is the best testimony.",1420502400,2,660,4.298387096774194

2670589,5,B000JGZA28,"This is Christian entertainment at it's very best.  It is inspirational for young and old alike.  If you want to teach your children the story of Christ's birth in a way they will never forget, I can't imagine a better way to do it.  My 2 year old daughter loves to sing along and clap her little hands.

The music is absolutely beautiful.  Your heart will soar.

There is just enough light-hearted humor to make you laugh without being irreverent in any way.

This is the kind of movie that makes you glad to be a Christian.  BRAVO!",1322265600,2,533,4.36734693877551
