8206631,4,B000SSONF2,"Fox Films presents ""COWBOY MILLIONAIRE"" (25 April 1935) (65 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) --- George O'Brien was an American actor, popular during the silent film era and into the talkie era of the 1930s, best known today as the lead actor in F. W. Murnau's 1927 film Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans --- American leading man of classic silent films who became a different kind of star in B-Western talkies --- The son of a policeman who later became police chief of San Francisco and then California Director of Penology, O'Brien was raised around police stables and quickly became adept at horsemanship --- He was a star athlete in school and intended to study medicine, but with the advent of World War I, he joined the Navy and volunteered to serve as a stretcher-bearer with the Marines.

Following his discharge, a chance encounter with Tom Mix led to a job as camera assistant with Mix's production company --- O'Brien takes on small jobs as a prop man, extra, stunt man, and finally bit player --- John Ford spotted the husky young man and cast him in the lead role of his early Western The Iron Horse (1924) --- He continued to work for Ford and became a popular leading man for a number of top-flight directors --- With the coming of sound, he moved almost exclusively into Westerns and became a popular star of low-budget oaters --- George remained popular until sound came along --- By that time, his popularity was sliding, but he did make the transition to sound --- With his rugged looks and physical size, he was soon a Western Cowboy Star --- He was in some of the best stories ever written, Riders of the Purple Sage (1931),

George O'Brien became a popular star of Westerns and rarely took parts outside of the Western film genre --- Throughout the 1930s, O'Brien was a consistent Top Ten box-office draw appearing in scores of Westerns, often atop his horse named Mike.
