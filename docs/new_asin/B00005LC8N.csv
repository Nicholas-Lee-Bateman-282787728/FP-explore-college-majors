7943864,4,B00005LC8N,"A thriller of some kind that tries and succeeds to be entertaining and funny. Lord Sinclair is definitely humorous. It is the exploration of some criminal minds in France, those who try to cheat with the system to put their hands on important fortunes. They are ready to do anything for that money, even kill of course. One is a disguised death and a cosmetized transfer of money before the announcement of the death itself. The second is the story of some gold smugglers who try to laundry some unclean gold, mostly stolen or recuperated from criminal activities. But all ends well and the criminals are caught. We feel reassured though we know many of these beings, because they are no men or women any more, are at large among us and on the look for some illegal and criminal profit.
