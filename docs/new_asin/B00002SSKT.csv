1256241,1,B00002SSKT,"ok, i love freddie and jamie, but this movie blew. the plot was terrible, the acting was second rate. and, the filming was weird. the accents were fake. it was COMPLETELY unrealistic. for those of you who hate wasting your  time, you'll hate this movie. but, for those of you who like movies simply  because of their stars, you'll like it.",955065600,,339,4.540983606557377
1256242,4,B00002SSKT,"I got this movie because Jamie Kennedy was in it and he didn't disappoint me. He gave a really good performance, along with Freddie Prinze Jr. It's a good movie, a little racy at times, but other than that, overall a fun  movie!",948931200,2,228,4.3023255813953485

7916236,5,B00002SSKT,"I love this movie so much. I was ecstatic when I finally found it to won. I caught on cable a few times, and I would look for it occasionally on dvd or streaming. I never could find it. And I stumbled across it here on Amazon. It is such a funny feel good movie. I love Park Overall. She is the main character who catches her husband cheating. And she decides it's time to get out and let her hair down. She stumbles across 3 guys that she trails to Las Vegas to find after they ditched at another casino. And it is just a wild ride of a night after that. I love this movie. I am so happy someone has it to offer.",1420070400,,613,3.873015873015873
7916237,5,B00002SSKT,"I tried to order this on DVD.  Apparently is no longer produced on DVD so I had to purchase a digital copy through Amazon's Unbox service.  I would have preferred to have a physical copy, but a digital copy is better than no copy at all.  I lost my VHS copy many years ago.

I discovered this movie in I think 2002 on some premium movie channel.  I remember being fascinated with it because a) it starred Park Overall, who was fabulous on 'Empty Nest' and b) because I had a bit of a crush on Steven Petrarca, who actually turned out to have better acting ability than Jamie Kennedy and Freddie Prinze Jr.  I think this film was Freddie's fifth or sixth acting credit.  Another standout in this film is the always amazing Veronica Cartwright.

This film has a lot of dark comedy and touching moments.  'Sparkler' was written by Darren Stein, who wrote and directed one of my favorite cult classics - 'Jawbreaker.'  'Sparkler' was released in 1997 and I can see elements of this film in 'Jawbreaker.'  If you enjoyed 'Jawbreaker' you'll like this film.",1397692800,,1051,4.537234042553192
7916238,4,B00002SSKT,Cute movie makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside with a twist at the end of the movie.  A good movie when on a date.,1344384000,,115,3.6
7916239,5,B00002SSKT,"I absolutely love this movie it is one of my all time favorites.

I starts with Melba May (Overall) who lives in a trailer park and catches her husband and her best friend in bed together. And runs over to her mother trailer on the other side of the park where she gets dressed I in a sparkly ball gown and goes to the local trailer park bar And loses one of her mothers earrings while dancing with three boys on there was to Vegas. The boys endup at the bar because there car has a flat tire. Melba mother is so up set and insists she calls them to get back the earring. ""well there goes another 19.95 down the drain."" The movie proceeds to Vegas where Melba meets up with an old high school friend Dottie. who was a showgirl 20 year's earlier but now works at the absolute sleaziest strip club's in the world. They go to find the boys and proceed to gamble and win money. when Melba's husband shows up in Vegas with there Trailer in tow and a letter from a sweepstakes letter that he got from some sweepstakes guy that showed up at there trailer with a camera crew and balloons and everything and the only way for him to get any of the money is if melba agrees to be on TV. so he is in Vegas trying to win her back. This movie is so funny and touching. Every friend I have shown it to also loves it.  I plead with the makers of this movie please release it on DVD. I have worn out 2 copies of Sparkler on VHS and am now purchasing my 3 copy of this movie. It is that good!!!!!!!",1104192000,,1480,4.030612244897959
7916240,5,B00002SSKT,"I was flipping through movie channels on cable the other day and I came across Sparkler.  Boredom made me watch it, even though I missed the beginning, but I was hooked immediately.  The chemistry between the cast was incredible.  I love Park Overall and I don't think any other actress could have played Melba.  Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Jamie Kennedy were also really good.  I was especially impressed with Steven Patrarca.  His portrayal of Joel was very moving.  The scenes of him coming out to Trent (Kennedy) were done really well.  Although the plot was far-fetched it was well-written.  I was also really impressed with the direction.  There weren't any useless scenes in the movie and everything had a point.  I wouldn't recommend this movie for younger people, but if you are looking for a warm-hearted comedy with a bit of a wicked twist, then Sparkler is definitely a movie you need to see.",1022976000,2,900,4.779220779220779
7916241,4,B00002SSKT,"I rented this movie after seeing Jamie Kennedy on the cover.  I thought that it sounded pretty weird, but I still rented just so that I could see him in a new movie.  It was predictable, but stil enjoyable.  Like another reviewer said, a bit racy at times.  The acting was good, and the directing wasn't bad either.  I think Jamie's character was the best one though...oh well, maybe I'm just biased since he's so cute.  =D",1006041600,,423,4.428571428571429
7916242,3,B00002SSKT,"This movie I sort of didn't connect to much with based on the usual interest I have on movies,
Although I can say it was an interesting plot-line where one can interpret that life doesn't always go as planned and it did have lots of funny moments and I was continually following along & the plot line didn't stray from the original goal.
But truely, every one should see this at least once, it is funny,
and it does show you how things can be connected in the end.

7916243,5,B00002SSKT,I was flipping through the channels late one night and this movie was just starting on Starz. I decided to give it a shot and loved it. It's the story of a woman who catches her husband cheating on her with her best friend so she decides to go out and celebrate her new singleness. When she goes out she meets three men who are on their way to Las Vegas but are stuck in the town for awhile while they waiting for their flat tire to be fixed. She mistakes their pity as friendship and goes to Las Vegas to be with them and look up an old school mate who is now a stripper. A funny movie that moves quickly and has alot of charm and good acting. The ending is a little far fetched but this is a worthwhile movie.,990403200,5,711,3.979020979020979
