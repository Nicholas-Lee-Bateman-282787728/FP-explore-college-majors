5635101,4,B00BJGXRP4,"Politically forbidden love, deception, misinformation, selfishness, desperation and other human characteristics are universal in time and place. Transposing the action to Victorian times, as this production does, is acceptable, although I don't believe it makes much of a difference. Music is what matters. Donizetti gave us one continuous succession of beautiful music and arias. The performers are up to the musical task in addition to their stage performance. What else can you ask?  The video cameras do a great job placing us right there. In fact, I would argue that in some scenes the affect achieved by the video is better than the one seen by the public in the theater.
The addition of the photographer to the famous sextet in act II is quite ingenious. Some purist may object, but compared to the alternative of having 6 singers in static positions, it is an interesting innovation.  Still, the music is what counts, and it is just beautiful. As expected, Netrebko renders a passionate mad scene. The producer adds a ghost to the cast for dramatic purposes. I don't think it is needed, but didn't bother me either. Overall, great performance to be watched many times.",1406505600,,1176,4.994897959183674
5635102,5,B00BJGXRP4,"Anna Netrebko's performance of the ""Mad Scene"" was the best of a few that I have seen performed, both in terms of acting and singing.  Also, the orchestration of the Mad Scene includes use of the glass harmonica as called for in the original score to great effect.  The sextet was staged thoughtfully and sung perfectly.",1389052800,,320,4.696428571428571
5635103,4,B00BJGXRP4,"In my opinion, stage director Mary Zimmerman should be banned from every opera house, everywhere. Her prior efforts, including a terribly staged Sonnambula, where she was booed by the audience, reflect a lack of in depth knowledge of opera in general, and the specific work in particular. By setting Lucia in Victorian times, she destroys the dramatic tension caused by feuding Scottish families that Sir Walter Scott wrote of and which Cammarano used for his libretto. By the age of Victoria, people just didn't do the feud thing anymore; it was much too ... untidy.

That said, musically and, in some cases dramatically, this is an exceptional performance.

I am an admitted fan of Anna Netrebko, and have taken a bit of flak, gentle reader, for expressing my admiration for both her vocal skills and dramatic ones in reviews here. While I recognize that the ""favorite soprano"" thing can get some folks' drillies in a knot, most those favorites are deceased or retired. For me, Netrebko has a fabulous instrument; not perfect, mind, but exceptional nonetheless, with rich tones, incredible vowel pronunciation and an even production from bottom to top. While not quite as agile as some of her coloratura sisters, her Lucia is well realized. Dramatically, she's the real deal.

Filling in for an ailing Rolando Villazon, we have, I bellieve, the breakthrough performance from Piotr Beczala. In her introduction, hostess Natalie Dessay notes that this may be ""his moment"" and it sure was. There is nothing negative in this Edgardo, and the voice and charm he displays here are some of the reasons that his career has taken off so well. I find him to be one of the best and exciting of the modern tenors,

Mariusz Kwiecien is a very talented baritone. If you have not caught his great Dr. Malatesta in Don Pasquale, you have missed a real treat. Here he brings that lovely, rich voice and good acting skills to the serious role of Lucia's brother Enrico, the ""villain of the piece"". Flawless in all dimensions.

Ildar Abdrazakov brings his rich bass and well developed acting skills to the role of Raimondo, the Ashton's Padre (in the religious sense). It's a rich role with Donizetti's wonderful melodies and he executes it very, very well.

Chorus and orchestra do well as one would expect from the Met, with Marco Armiliato doing a committed job from the pit.

Disc quality is superb, which is what I have come to expect from DG. Sound in the DTS mode continues to amaze.

And to give the devil his due (well, her due), the staging of the fountain scene with the spectre of the drowned girl Lucia sings about is a nice touch, but the drama falls apart without that tension caused by the feud, and the sextet's staging makes one weep in frustration for the opportunity missed.

I am glad to have this performance, gentle reader, but i'd be happier if Ms. Zimmerman had stayed on Broadway and left opera to those who know, love and respect it.",1371772800,33,2943,4.766208251473477

8569672,5,B00BJGXRP4,"When this DVD was released I was not going to buy it because it has been criticized for changing the era to the Victorian period which altered the meaning. I think that this story can happen in ours days.
I understand the tragedy of these two people who are in love and have to face Lucias brother opposition to their relationship forcing her to marry someone her brother wants because hell solve the family economic issues. As a result of this marriage she looses her sanity and kills her husband.
 I found the scenery very evocative, for instance were the ghost of a girl who died in the fountain appeared while Lucia sang her first area showing her tormented thought. The transformation from the mad scene to the scene at the cemetery when Edgardo sang his last two areas is beautiful
The cast was very good.
Anna Netrebko in the main character was very convincing, her lover; Edgardo played by Piotr Beczala who substituted Rolando Villazon was very good showing his affection for her, disappointment and then how he changed when he realized what happened to her.
Lucias brother played by Mariusz Kwiecien who usually plays comedy roles was very good playing a villain.
The ensembles and choruses were also outstanding as well as the smaller roles.
The quality of this DVD was exceptionally good.
I am very glad that I bought this production.",1427587200,,1346,4.752136752136752
8569673,4,B00BJGXRP4,"I have listened to Lucia many times over the years (I have three versions on CD) and attended many performances.  It is in my top five list.  I have always thought that the opening chorus in Lucia is one of the greatest of all opera beginnings.  It starts the opera out with a bang and is full of energy that sucks you in to the action immediately.  In this Blu-ray, at least using PCM stereo (I do not have surround), the opening was a disaster.  The normally superb Met chorus sounded weak and out of sync, and Michael Myers (Normanno) sounded awful. Whether this was how it sounded in the opera house I cannot say, because the PCM stereo during act 1 was technically flawed.  The orchestra sounded wonderful, but the singers sounded like they were in a cave, or at a great distance.  Almost like listening to the old Met Radio Broadcasts over a cheap transistor radio.  I listened multiple times, including over headphones and it seems to be a case of misplaced or malfunctioning mikes.  As Enrico moved around the stage the sound quality changed.  Whenever he approached the front of the stage the sound improved dramatically, perhaps because the orchestra mikes picked him up.  Whatever the reason, the audio quality ruined the first act.  It was so bad I returned the disc and got a replacement but it was the same. (I also emailed Deutsche Grammophon, but they have not seen fit to respond).  The sound was, however, amazingly detailed when it came to extraneous noise.  Every stage footstep, swishing of a dress or crumpling of a letter was easily audible, as was a lot of coughing from the audience.  One star for the first act because of the audio.
  Fortunately the sound improved after the first act.  I don't think it is as good as it should be, but it was passable.
  The remainder of the opera was excellent, particularly Act 3.  The Mad Scene and the finale were spectacular.  Netrebko does not have Sutherland's voice, but so what, who does?  She is a marvelous singing actress and her performance was very moving. Ildar Abdrazakov sang Raimondo beautifully and with passion.  Mariusz Kwiecien was marvelous as Enrico.  He succeeded in making me hate him.  Piotr Beczala sang fabulously as Edgardo.  His acting leaves a bit to be desired, consisting of the stock expressions and stage movements they teach in tenor school.  All things considered, a 4 1/2 star performance by the leads.
  The production itself is mostly excellent, with one glaring exception.  The sets were excellent, particularly for the mad scene, as were the costumes.  I did not mind the period change.  The use of the phantom in several scenes was well done.  Having Lucia appear as a phantom in the finale worked for me.  The conclusion, as Lucia's ghost kisses the dead Edgardo, was very poignant.
  The glaring exception was the apparent decision by the director to treat the sextet (one of the greatest dramatic ensembles in all of opera) in a comic manner. First, as the scene is unfolding we have the chorus all tilting their heads in unison in a comic attempt to overhear the conversation between Enrico and Arturo.  We then have the distraction of the photographer running around the stage arranging the group photo during the entire sextet. Then, just in case we haven't realized  how clever the director is yet, we get an exclamation point: he has the photographer light the flash as the final note is dying away.  Why do opera directors have to engage in these banalities? (see for example, Isolde's brain hemorrhage courtesy of Chereau, or McVicar dressing Papagena as trailer trash.) Are they having a contest to see who can do the dumbest thing?
  In the end, despite the inexcusably horrible audio in act 1 and the visual ruining of the sextet by the director, there are so many wonderful things about this Blu-ray that, despite myself, I gave it 3.75 stars, rounding up to 4.  Worth having in your collection for the last act alone, although they really should reduce the price because of the act one audio issue.",1426291200,,4018,4.729106628242075

8569676,5,B00BJGXRP4,Opera Newbie Review:  Beautiful music with gothic romance comic-book plot.  Anna Netrebko is amazing and I found her performance beautiful.,1417564800,,139,5.9
8569677,3,B00BJGXRP4,"Bel canto is not about singing loudly, which seems to have been forgotten here. At times, i thought that this was Verdi! And once one starts, the rest pile on so they won't seem weak.
I was disappointed to see some reviewers going out of their way to diss the Sutherland MET Lucia. It may not be perfect, but it gets so many things right that this production misses. So I pulled that set out and did some comparisons.

Sutherland was a true dramatic coloratura soprano, while Netrebko has a fairly colorless voice with rudimentary coloratura. She's trying to cover a lot of different bases with a pretty basic voice, and looking back I think people will start to realize that. Netrebko is good at showmanship. Sutherland had a beautiful and unique voice which she then worked to hone to perfection. Her coloration, coloratura and ability to float the voice were flawless, are out of Netrebko's reach.
It was a pleasure to be introduced to Beczala's tenor and look forward to future encounters.there are still some focus and colorization points he could learn from Kraus, but he did a fine job, and he didn't oversing.
Kwiecien chose a pugnacious characterization here, which he thouht was kind of ""sexy"". I disagree. There are a number of issues going on with the brother that are spelled out in the text; he could have brought some depth to the character, rather than just being pushy and bullying.
I enjoyed Abdrazakov as the cleric, but when I went back and listened to  Paul Plishka I suddenly remembered what a great and enormous voice he has.
MET broadcasts in those days were captured with area mics, which picked up their large voices in a live setting unlike the body mics of today, which miss much of the resonance. I wish that the Met would go back to at least putting more of the area mic in the mix. I suspect we lost some of Abdrazakov's voice in the process. The sound on the old set is a bit more recessed, more like listening from a good orchestra seat while the new one in someways is like sitting on the stage. I prefer it when the sound has the opportunity to resonate and mix together.
Regardless, I found the singing on the new set to be way too loud, and there's really no need for it, although it's actually easier for the singers to sing more loudly rather than pay closer attention to coloration and blending.
I prefer the style used on the old set where the emphasis was on beautiful singing, blending and coloration. The new Netrebko set seems more geared toward being an entertainment.
During this process I also listened to a 2005 live production of Lucia from the Teatro Donizetti, starring Desiree Rancatore.  I've seen her on several other programs. She is a dramatic coloratura although not yet of Sutherland's level of achievement, and she sings well. She is surrounded by singers of similar mastery. The sets are minimal, but with period custumes. The 5.1 sound is demonstration quality. Because Dynamic works with smaller theaters, the singers don't have to strain to make themselves heard and Dynamic gets to put their microphones pretty much in the best positions. In a small house, singers tend to interact more with each other, rather than breaking to turn to the audience. I'll write a separate review before I get carried away here.
I bought this bluray for the male singers and was rewarded by meeting Beczala, and being reminded s some great old stars who have NOT been superseded.
I hope you'll make sure to see both the Sutherland and Rancatore productions of Lucia.
They are worthy of your attention.",1412726400,10,3548,4.6826923076923075
