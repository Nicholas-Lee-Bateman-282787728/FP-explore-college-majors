8333319,4,B001PIHORS,I was happy with the cd it was not to informing but it was enough to get started you know,1391212800,,89,3.5
8333320,3,B001PIHORS,"There is nothing negative I can say about this video however, I was expecting so much more. This is a guy from a shop in California who (I'm guessing) was told by someone that he should make a video and rake in oodles of cash. Well, good for him...nothing wrong with that. I hope he did.

This tells you the basics. Naming the parts of a guitar, how to replace strings, the truss rod is explained (briefly). Nothing..let me say that again...NOTHING beyond the highest level you could possibly offer. Now, I wasn't expecting an experts course in how to be a luthier but, this is for people who have never seen a guitar before. This is more of an episode of ""How it Works"" not ""let me show you what an expert really does"".

In a nutshell...this is a really nice nine dollar and ninety-nine cent video for an absolute beginner. Not a thirty dollar video. That is the part that bothers me. I would happily pay that for a decent production that allows me to take away something I could use and not, a guy who doesn't seem comfortable in front of a camera telling me things you would hear in a course entitled ""Introduction to the Guitar 101"".",1301788800,2,1137,4.38388625592417
8333321,5,B001PIHORS,"I've been having the same luthier setup my guitars for years and when I ask him to explain something to me he just grunts. I was never really happy with how he set the action on my Martin D-15, so I decided to add this video to my collection in the hopes that I would learn a few new things. . . . I did! I even learned a better way to string my guitar in this video! I recommend this video to any serious musician.",1234828800,,415,3.8372093023255816
8333322,5,B001PIHORS,If you're serious about guitar playing then this is the video for you. I was impressed by this DVD. The 3D animation is really useful in explaining things. I have a much better understanding of my instrument and how it works after watching this video. I recommend it!,1234137600,,267,4.583333333333333
8333323,5,B001PIHORS,This DVD is a must have for anyone who wants to learn how to set up and maintain an acoustic guitar. I'm very pleased with the step by step instructions. Great Buy!,1232928000,,164,4.15625
