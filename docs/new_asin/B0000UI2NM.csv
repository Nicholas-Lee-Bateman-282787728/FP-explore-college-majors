1946789,5,B0000UI2NM,"Okay, here's the deal: if you are looking for deep character development and an airtight plot than you had no intention of seeing a modern action movie in the first place. So why are the critics so cruel?  I think a lot of professionals felt that they got on the Matrix bandwagon too late and to compensate they are trying to jump ship before the genre starts sinking. Stylish action flicks were en vogue the past few years and I'm sure Mr. Ebert has the hate mail to prove it.
Regardless, Underworld in what it appears to be.  A stylish, frenetic action film with the right mix of CGI, thin but compelling plotlines, and jaw dropping action to warrant an addition to my DVD collection when it gets distributed.  It's a winner.  To think otherwise...well, you would have had to be looking for something that is wasn't nor should it have been.  For its genre it's an exceptional piece of cinema.",1063929600,3,894,4.527950310559007
1946790,5,B0000UI2NM,"The movie climatically was wonderful and a good cast of new faces provided a surprising pleasant performance. Overall the movie was without question one of the better movies of its genre. An unusually thick deep plot was woven while not sacrificing the flow and progression of the action sequences. A good idea for anyone to see it, as I highly recommend you do, and for those of us who have already. I believe the consciences is a sequel should be in order. Enjoy the show, it might ruin you for those of it's kind to come. But I hope it simply raises the bar.",1063929600,2,561,4.403846153846154
1946791,5,B0000UI2NM,"those that reviewed this movie that said it {stink's} havnt seen the movie like they said tehy did. this movie realy surprised methe only problem i ahd was teh actor that played the temp leader of the vampires he was pretty bad but every one else was great the action was good not to over teh top matrix like everyone else said it had and for teh reviewer that said teh jumpin off the chuch was at teh end just saw that in teh preview , cause she did that in the first 5 min . any one liking werewolves or vampires should go see this movie its was a great twist on the treid and boring vampire movies.",1063929600,,601,4.0588235294117645
1946792,2,B0000UI2NM,"Did you know there has been a war going on for hundreds of years?  And it all started because the upper class and lower class dared to fall in love and have an abomination for a baby?  Master vs. Servant!  Father vs. Daughter!  Oh, the drama! How can they fit all this into one movie!  Easy, Underworld leaves out any sense of character development and relies on convoluted and cliched story lines.  But there is plenty of fun action to distract you from remembering you don't give a lick about the leading characters (what was Kate Beckinsale thinking?).  It's like eating Twinkie.  Oh sure, it was fun to eat, but once it's gone you wonder why you ever indulged.",1063584000,5,664,4.5210084033613445
1946793,5,B0000UI2NM,"Taking an old story with old style monsters and usuing mdern age, Underworld should be a top contender to go. The batte is between the Vampires and Werewolves who's war have been waging for years hiding from the likes of human eyes. But Seline a great Vampire falls in love with a Human who has a special blood in his sytem that will stop the werewolves from being extinct, Now a war will wage on. So what do we expect a good story awesome graphics, and taking an old remdeial story of Romeo and Juliette and putting it in modern age might make this a sure hit. I find it should be exciting and action packed to the max. So what should everyone do find the piece of the story everyone will enjoy and go see this movie, looking great.",1061769600,9,733,4.242857142857143
1946794,5,B0000UI2NM,"I'm not the biggest fan of dark, gothic-like films. But this film looks interesting. The ides of a vampire-werewolf battle film sounds awesome! I think that Kate Beckinsale is one of the most beautiful and talented actresses in Hollywood (why they didn't choose her for ""Tomb Raider,"" I'll never know), and she looks extremely sexy in this one! I'm gonna try to see this film, are you?",1057881600,8,385,4.7611940298507465
1946795,5,B0000UI2NM,"The premise of this movie is basically a gothic rendition of Romeo and Juliet. On one side you have the Death Dealers. An ancient race of vampires living among humans for centuries. On the other you have the Lychans. Savage werewolves who battle the Death Dealers for common survival. Both groups of creatures have secretly been at war for countless centuries but a sudden twist is thrown into the mix. One of the Death Dealer's leaders, Selene (played by Kate Beckinsale), falls for a young human on the run named Michael (played by Scott Speedman). When his ties to the Lychans becomes known, Selene must decide if her future with Michael is worth betraying her people. Set in a gothic/Matrix look and setting, Underworld is expected to be one of the sleeper hits of 2003.

Michael soon finds an ally in Selene (Kate Beckinsale), a vampire Death Dealer who has only one goal, kill as many Lycans as she can.  The head liar in charge of her coven is a craven creep named Kraven (Shane Brolly).  He has ambitions.  Hes a bit tawdry at times so Selene makes the grave mistake of waking the head sleaze (Bill Nighy as Viktor).  Viktor has too many secrets.  Apparently, vampires aren't to be trusted.

Very stylish and artsy, half the fun is watching Kate Beckinsale elegantly sweep through a room.  Theres a lot of gunplay.  Plenty of action to keep restless eyes engaged.  Its dark, in more ways than one.  The story is basic.  The acting goes hither and yon, depending on the actor.  Bill Nighy is always a treat to watch, Shane Brolly much less so.  It is what it is, another vampire flick.

In the Underworld, Vampires are a secret clan of modern aristocratic sophisticates whose mortal enemies are the Lycans (werewolves), a shrewd gang of street thugs who prowl the city's underbelly. No one knows the origin of their bitter blood feud, but the balance of power between them turns even bloodier when a beautiful young Vampire warrior and a newly-turned Lycan with a mysterious past fall in love. Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman star in this modern-day, action-packed tale of ruthless intrigue and forbidden passion and all set against the dazzling backdrop of a timeless, Gothic metropolis.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: UNDERWORLD [2003] is a fantastic over the top slick presentation with a hint of a sci-fi action packed Vampires Vs Werewolves franchise brilliant film. In the shadows of the real world, war rages between the aristocratic neck-biters and the losing Lycans. But leather-clad warrior vamp Selene [Kate Beckinsale] suspects the furry fighters may battle back, and defies coven creep Kraven [Shane Brolly] to pursue the apparently harmless human Michael [Scott Speedman] she believes is involved.

At the start of the film we are informed The war had all but ground to a halt in the blink of an eye. Lucian, the most feared and ruthless leader ever to rule the Lycan clan, had finally been killed. The Lycan horde scattered to the wind in a single evening of flame and retribution. Victory, it seemed, was in our grasp, the very birth right of the vampires. Nearly six centuries had passed since that night, yet the ancient feud proved unwilling to follow Lucian to the grave. Though Lycans were fewer in number, the war itself had become more perilous, for the moon no longer held her sway. Older, more powerful Lycans, were now able to change at will. The weapons had evolved, but our orders remained the same: Hunt them down and kill them off, one by one. And so we begin the story of UNDERWORLD which is a surprisingly-good horror action adventure romp, where vampires battle for werewolves for survival in a centuries-long war.

UNDERWORLD was the first of four films so far in this franchise series. The first film was a joint British-German-Hungarian-US production with a mostly British cast. The setting is not said throughout the film, but it is pretty obvious it is Hungary and nearby Eastern European countries. This is probably the best in the series, but the next two films are equally great as well. Only the fourth tended to slightly lets it down but I will talk about that in future Underworld franchise film Blu-ray reviews. Throughout the UNDERWORLD film we are introduced to very interesting characters and despite criticism of the film that I have read, I think the story is character-driven despite a hell of a lot of visually-exciting action. It is an action film but the action isn't what makes it great, it is the screenplay and the characters we view throughout the film.

There is plenty of plot throughout the film, especially with the roots of the war scenario, cross-breeding, and vampire elder Viktor [Bill Nighy] but it's too complicated to unravel here. Attempting to explain the environment and undead genealogy, the makers offer an interesting new angle on old age myths, though the information-overload begs questions: Why do elders hibernate? What's wolf-warrior Lucian [Michael Sheen] been doing for 500 years and especially waxing his claws?

Of all the films about vampires, werewolves, or vampires versus werewolves, I suppose UNDERWORLD is one of the better ones. Without much regard for the story, but it definitely has an incredible passion throughout the film. The Set Decoration production by Malcolm Stone and Costume Design values by Wendy Partridge were clearly a labour of love. Considering the basis for the story is definitely a Gothic reinterpretation of Shakespeares Romeo and Juliet. It is also has a really fantastic and an enjoyable adventure in exploring an alternative reality world and especially a blend of gunmetal glamour of gloomy Gothicism gives the UNDERWORLD film that absolutely beautiful to view we so admire with this film. Director Len Wiseman has a background in the art department and although dress sense and sets are styled or stolen from other successful sci-fi series like Blade and The Matrix most blatantly, Len Wiseman slides from scene to scene with an arresting comic book style performance that we greatly admire.

UNDERWORLD is really exciting, engaging and totally perfect in my opinion and also to the massive amount of fans out there that love and admire this film. Of course the best moments come from stunning cinematography and set design that looks so good and stunning that I cannot recommend it enough. Director Len Wisemen knows what he was doing in making this film, and what's more does it on a comparatively small budget; especially with the totally brilliant fight scenes in the sewers are totally ground-breaking. And if you are looking for some fun in a dark disturbed world of a gothic scenario, heavy metal loving gods, and then this film UNDERWORLD definitely delivers 100%.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Sony Pictures Home Entertainment have brought us the ultimate 1080p encoded image. This Blu-ray disc brings you great reference image transfer that really gives you a near 4K quality image. Practically continuous sharp images with excellent inspirational quality detail. Despite the consistently dark shots, always gives you a feel of a three-dimensional image resolution that is spot on. On top of all that you get totally perfect contrast throughout the film. Also the colour palette throughout the film is totally excellent and the picture exhibits a level of stability that rivals the ultimate image transfer on the market. What is also impressive is the fine details of objects that are totally astounding at times, especially the bristled hairs on the back of the actor's neck, tiny chips in a werewolf's claws, and brickwork on distant buildings all provide a brilliant surreal level of clarity that occasionally makes the picture quality gives you a near 4K high-definition demonstration material.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Sony Pictures Home Entertainment brings you this UNDERWORLD Unrated Extended Cut Blu-ray disc in a totally mind blowing 5.1 LPCM [Uncompressed] audio experience that is by far the best audio presentation I have heard in a very long time, that is definitely an audio reference title that we experienced on the original DVD release for its sound audio mix and this upgraded Blu-ray title continues the tradition of giving us the ultimate audio enhanced sound experience, which is totally  fantastic and also giving us a very aggressive performance, particularly in the action sequences throughout the film that gives all of your loudspeakers lots of amazing booming sound effects that never overloads the speakers. Even with the violent shoot outs, there is more than enough in this film that locates the sounds precisely with all of your speakers. Atmospherically, the sound mix scores 100% with its perfectly converted soundscapes, which through discreetly used surround effects puts the viewer centre of the world of the vampires and werewolves that creates an amazing and wholly convincing sound field that is totally accurate and spot on. The surround channels movement is totally natural, and conversations are nicely natural to give a really nice acoustic atmosphere all round. So all in all, fans who owned any of the previous inferior DVD edition releases will be extremely pleased with this ultimate upgrade and especially a must purchasing of this 2016 Blu-ray release if you want to get the ultimate visual and surround sound experience.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio commentary with Director Len Wiseman and Actors Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman: This is a brand new recorded commentary from director Len Wiseman, actress Kate Beckinsale and actor Scott Speedman. Len Wiseman, Kate Beckinsale, and Scott Speedman are viewing the new Unrated Extended Cut of the film, but what really annoyed me about this audio commentary is that I had to crank up the sound quite a lot, to get some idea whatever they were talking about certain things about the film. The director Len Wiseman makes a point to note that this is not a ""Director's Cut"" of the film, but simply a reworked cut of the film that includes some moments that were cut from the previous original film release due to pacing reasons. When you get to the scene with the shoot out on the Underground station, you see Kate Beckinsale pick up the digital camera, but then point out when Kate Beckinsale jumps out of the door at the end of the underground train, the digital camera is nowhere to be seen. When we get to see Kate Beckinsale enters the apartment of Scott Speedman, the number on the door is 510, well they point out is all types of films that shows doors, they usually have a combination of the numbers with the figure number 5, but point out they do this because they do not want to use other numbers for apartments, so they do not relate to a real persons apartment. I found at times comments by  Scott Speedman to be totally vacuous and most of the time does not seem to know what is going on in the film, so cannot understand why they had him there for the audio commentary, as it was totally pointless with his pathetic comments. Also I also found most of the time the comments by Len Wiseman and Kate Beckinsale also vacuous at times while Scott Speedman was there. Actor Scott Speedman had to leave the recording session about 73 minutes into the film as he had to rush off for an audition for a film he was to appear in that was set in Paris, but we are not informed of the Title of the film, and so the audio commentary between Len Wiseman and Kate Beckinsale continued but when there is just the two of them, the audio commentary started to improve slightly, but only slightly. But to my mind, most of the time all three of them talk about nothing in general and also nothing of great interest and also has to be one of the worst audio commentary I have ever heard, and what makes if worst is I have read other reviews of this particular audio commentary, saying it was totally hilarious and extremely funny, well those particular reviewers must have been watching another audio commentary, but not this one and as far as I am concerned this definitely get a one star rating.

Special Feature: Outtakes [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [3:43] With these typical outtakes, they are really nothing more than a glorified gag reel of goof ups, bloopers and you even get to see a Lycan do a silly dance routine. We unfortunately get to see poor Brad Martin [Stunt Coordinator] slip while carrying the step ladder, I do hope he didn't hurt himself too much. In the background in some of the outtakes you get to hear the following music tracks, which consist of ROCKSTAR [Composed and Performed by Mark David & William Tabanou of NBS] and RED TAPE [Performed by Agent Provocateur].

Special Feature: Featurettes [2003 / 2004] [480i] [1.33:1] [1:13:38] Here we have a brilliant selection of Seven individual supplement special features and they are as follows:

01. Special Feature: Fang Vs. Fiction [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [47:18] Here we have a documentary exploring the mythology and lore of vampires and werewolves throughout history. Using clips from classic horror films and contemporary interviews, this in-depth cable-TV documentary tries to separate truth from fable in discussing vampires and werewolves. This documentary also looks into the myths behind werewolves and vampires, mixing in occasional film footage with interviews with knowledgeable experts on the subject. It's an interesting, generally well-done look at some of the possibilities behind the creatures. Contributors include: Tatyana Yassukovich (Narrator), J. Gordon Melton (Author: Vampire Book: The Encyclopaedia of the Undead), Daniel Cohen (Author: Werewolves), Brad Steiger (Author: The Werewolf Book), Katherine Ramsland (Author: The Science of Vampires), Nicolae Paduraru (Head of the Transylvanian Society of Dracula), Gypsy Zanval (Lycanthrope), David Farrant (British Psychic and Occult Society), Kalila Smith (Author: Journey Into Darkness), Freddie Salazar (Boat Captain of Cajun Pride Swamp Tours), Linda S. Godfrey (Author: The Beast of Bray Road), Crudelia (Vampire) and Morditha Kalavera (Vampire).

02. Special Feature: The Making of UNDERWORLD [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [13:02] This feature introduces the film with a lot of talking heads and footage from the feeling of the film to the script and production. This one is kind of basic, but essential if you love the film UNDERWORLD and of course have not seen this extra yet on the previous Blu-ray releases. Everyone in this extra that talks seems to thinks this one is slick and interesting and as a massive fan of this film I would totally have to agree. Contributors include: Kate Beckinsale [Selene], Len Wiseamn [Director], Richard Wright [Producer], Bill Nighy [Viktor], Scott Speedman [Michael], Shane Brolly [Kraven], Kevin Grevioux [Raze/Co-Writer], Erwin Leder [Singe], Michael Sheen [Lucian], Danny McBride [Screenwriter], Sophie Myles [Erika], Guy Himber [Patrick Tatopoulos Designs, Inc.], Scott McElroy [Soren/Assistant Stunt Coordinator], Brad Martin [Stunt Coordinator] and Gary Lucchesi [Film Producer].

03. Special Feature: The Visual Effects of UNDERWORLD [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [9:56] This feature is all about the CGI world and also exploring and explaining in-depth about what goes into the CGI computer generated visual effects employed in the film. I very much liked how they showed that one of the car flips into the water was actually a model and other special effects that you do not realise they were such effects. Contributors include: James McQuaide [Executive producer/VFX Supervisor], Payam Shohadai [VFX Supervisor/Owner of Luma Pictures] and Martin Hunter [Film Editor].

04. Special Feature: Creature Effects [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [12:30] This feature is all about the in-depth look at the detail, design, movement and intricacy of the creatures on display, namely the werewolves. It was really interesting to see the moulds being made to make the said werewolf suits the stunt artists have to wear, especially with their running blades. Contributors include: Patrick Tatopoulos [Creature/Production Designer], Len Wiseman [Director], Danny McBride [Screenwriter], Guy Himber [Creature FX Supervisor], Steve Wang [Creature FX Art Director], Gabe Bartalos [Lab Technician Supervisor] and Bill Nighy [Viktor].

05. Special Feature: Stunts [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [11:43] This feature is all about the amazing stunts you get to see in the film UNDERWORLD. The stunt coordinator Brad Martin talks extensively on how he wanted the stunts to look good in the film. The director Len Wiseman said he shot things the way they were drawn in the storyboards. We get to see Kate Beckinsale doing a lot of stunt wire work practice which was quite interesting to view. Contributors include: Brad Martin [Stunt Coordinator], Len Wiseman [Director], Kate Beckinsale [Selene], Scott McElroy [Assistant Stunt Coordinator], Richard Wright [producer], Danny McBride [Screenwriter], Michael Sheen [Lucian], Scott Speedman [Michael] and Bill Nighy [Viktor].

06. Special Feature: Designing UNDERWORLD [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [10:46] This feature goes into great detail on what they based the look of the film UNDERWORLD and especially the locations chosen by the director Len Wiseman to be filmed in that he specifically wanted the film to have that authentic look where vampires and werewolves would reside, the actual locations were in Budapest, Hungary, Gozsdu udvar, Budapest, Hungary, Budapest Subway, Budapest, Hungary and Mafilm, Budapest, Hungary. Contributors include: Bruton Jones [Film Art Director/Production Designer/Conceptual Artist] and Len Wiseman [Director].

06. Special Feature: The Look of UNDERWORLD [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [19:12] This feature explores the cinematography of the film UNDERWORLD and the post production process that wanted to try and give the film that unique, gritty, graphic novel realistic look as possible. Len Wiseman also wanted to not have any scenes that had supermarkets or see a gas station where people are filling their cars with petrol, as it would not have been very cool, as it does not really exist in the real Underworld scenario. Also Len Wiseman points out that when it comes to the telephone, you will of course see no modern digital phone, it has to be the old fashioned type of telephone. On top of all that, Len Wiseman could not make the film with celluloid film, but had to be filmed with the digital format camera, as the director wanted to achieve a washed out look, especially relating to the world of the vampires and werewolves, and especially the fact that Len Wiseman hated the thought of the film being made in colour. Contributors include: Richard Wright [Producer], Tony Pierce-Roberts [Cinematographer] and James McQuaid [Visual Effects Supervisor/Co-Executive Producer].

07. Special Feature: Sights and Sounds [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [9:07] Here with this final feature we have a great deal of behind-the-scenes clips from the actual filming of UNDERWORLD and the in-depth preparation to seeing the laughter and good times had by all on the film set. Unfortunately once again we get to see poor Brad Martin [Stunt Coordinator] slip while carrying the step ladder, sadly we do not find out if he hurt himself too much.

Special Feature: Music Video: Worms of Earth by Finch [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [2:45] This music video of the song called Worms of the Earth by Finch is complete with footage from the film. The song in my opinion is something that is well over the top and definitely over rated, which you may enjoy or hate and it is entirely up to you to choose. To my mind, if this was the best group available at the time for the video shoot, so why is it I have never heard of them or if they had any more hits in the future?

Special Feature: Storyboard Comparison [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [6:42] Here we have a side-by-side comparison of a few key scenes with their original storyboard sketches. If you're interested in sketches of this calibre, then this one is for you. What you get to view is that at the top of the screen is the black-and-white storyboard images and below it you get view scenes from the actual film and in that way you can compare the two images on view.

Finally, UNDERWORLD [2003] is a totally wonderfully over the top and its caveats remains so totally engrossing, and totally compelling at the same time, especially with the very dramatic spooky atmosphere, enthusiastic action packed film that never gets boring, and at the same time maintains a mysterious watch ability, and has now become a totally unabashed scary cult classic. The last act sees the film finally living up to its potential and finding out whether Michael can survive being bitten by both a werewolf and a vampire, in finding out if he will be turning into a superior hybrid. The final battle scenes are genuinely thrilling, and the conclusion is very satisfying, which of course leads us to leaving the door wide open for a definite sequel, which of course makes the prospect of a sequel totally tantalising that eventually came to fruition and I cannot wait to review the other Blu-ray disc Vampires Vs Werewolves franchise. Highly Recommended!

1946854,4,B0000UI2NM,"Note: For this review, movie was viewed using an OPPO UDP-203 Ultra HD Blu-Ray Player and a 2016 LG OLED TV (65"")

Underworld is a bit of an older title to be released on the format -- it's going on near 15 years while most Ultra HD Blu-Ray titles are of recent releases. One of the problems with older titles are the CGI effects (they just don't hold up) and whether the company does a full remaster or if they decide to upscale the years-old blu-ray release.

I'm happy to say that Underworld looks great in 4K.. but with a disclaimer. The film itself is very, very dark (as it's meant to be). On an OLED, it looks fantastic and blends into the screen with HDR; if you're using a lower-end LCD/LED panel, it may not look as good as the blacks will be a lighter grey color.

The majority of the film takes place in very dark areas and has a very muted/de-saturated color palette, but it really works for it.

As someone who generally prefers a very clean, modern, noise-free image... I actually did like Underworld on 4K. I will say that it's a VERY, VERY grainy movie and you'll notice it instantly. If this is a problem for you, you may want to skip it. With that said, I found the grain to be very natural and not like digital noise or too distracting. There is no way around it though: Grain everywhere.

The movie comes in a 2-disc set with an Ultra HD Blu-Ray, a 1080p Blu-Ray and a digital copy code. All extras are on disc 2 (1080p) while the movie itself comes in at 2.35:1 (black bars on the top/bottom) and Dolby Atmos sound.

Fortunately, Sony has gone for a somewhat discounted price here. Overall, very happy with the title but not for everyone.",1490745600,9,1660,4.338709677419355

1946897,5,B0000UI2NM,"Underworld  is one of my favorite movies, and I love the action. This the beginning of the series, and it is a movie where you will watch it more than once. Underworld was the first movie to introduce the clash between vampires and lycans, and nailed the hybrid concept.  Also, I enjoyed the story lines and interaction of each character involved whether their role was main or minute. The highlight moment  was the forbidden relationship between Selene and Michael, which amplified the feud between the two clans. The chemistry between Selene and Michael evolves in Underworld Evolution, and I miss it in the remaining  series because Michael is not present . The story plot is fresh and not cliched, and there is not a lot of CG.  The actors are performing most of their own stunts, and characters' costumes are intensively detailed.  This movie leaves you wanting to see more movies from this series (I have seen all them except for Underworld 5, which I can't wait until it becomes available to buy on Amazon).",1484092800,2,1014,4.765714285714286

1946993,2,B0000UI2NM,"This film has some flaws - its central flaw is that it is way too long, but I love the atmosphere, Kate Beckinsale's character, and the story.

There is not a single ray of sunshine.  The film is all dark, haunting, and majestic.

A war between the Lycans and the Vampires, which has gone of forever.  Selene/Kate Beckinsale confesses her loathing of the Lycans for killing her family.  She has no mercy; she is determined to kill every last one.  But she is taken by a human the Lycans have been stalking.

Because the Lycans have a plan.

What Selene thought she knew is warped.

This is Kate Beckinsale's film, and she gives an earnest performance.  She is dressed in black leather; her hair is carelessly styled in a rough pageboy; and her eyes are sometimes blue.  She is articulate, crisp, and intent, and she is no understanding of her feelings - only that is drawn to Michael, who is referred to as the human.

This is an ambitious film.  The atmosphere is perfect.  I enjoyed it, though I thought some of the scenes were prolonged and tedious and worst of all, unnecessary.  I can understand why some might believe this film is boring.  I will also say that the script isn't particularly good.  Though the story is good, the characters weren't particularly articulate.  They should speak with grandeur, give speech that I admire, and not just say the obvious and mundane.

I wish Viktor/Bill Nighy and especially the gorgeous Amelia/ Zita Grg were more prominently featured.  I was curious about Amelia - what was her story?  I didn't get enough of her though Vicktor mourned her passing.

The film could have benefited from some editing, and been tighter on the script.  But the ambitious was immense, and I did like the mythology.",1439078400,,1741,4.673267326732673

1947087,5,B0000UI2NM,"I have to say this is one of my all time favorite movies and series. If you love vampires or werewolves this one has them both in spades! Add a ton of action and yes romance thrown into the mix and you have Underworld.

The Death Dealers (vampires) are pitted against the Lycans (werewolves) in a literal age old blood feud with one fraction fighting to destroy the other at all costs. Both have major strategic strong points and weaknesses the werewolves are strong and viral, the vampires are equally strong and with increasing weaponry tech seem to be slowly gaining the upper hand on the werewolves. Thus leading the Lycans to search for the original strain of their origin a direct descendant of the Corvinus clan to strengthen them and help them gain the upper hand on the vampires once and for all.  They finally track down a human Michael Corvin who is indeed a direct descendant from the Corvinus line. But when the lycans go to kidnap him a death dealer named Selene sees them and nabs him first wondering what the Lycans could possibly be wanting with this particular human. She takes him back to the coven and things go majorly awry for them all from there. The vampires are not happy with Selene for bringing this outsider into their inner sanctum and they are even more enraged when Selene takes it upon herself to awaken one of the Vampire Elders Viktor to seek his guidance in what to do about the plot that she has stumbled upon with the Lycans.

Along the way Selene and Michael begin to have feelings for one another and plots are uncovered that turn both of their worlds upside down and test loyalties with all involved.

Think of it kind of like Romeo and Juliet with fangs and fur - and a better ending!

Kate Beckinsale is just awesome in this as Selene. She totally proved to everyone that she could kick butt and take names with this one. (I so want one of those long leather trench coats with the vampire knotwork on the back like she wears soooo bad LOL.)

This truly is one that is both thrilling, romantic, and just an all around great action packed fun ride. I loved it from the first time I saw it, and it remains one of my all time favorites that I find myself re-watching again and again. This is one movie that my husband and I agree on we both adore it.

1947099,5,B0000UI2NM,This is what a vampire movie should look like. The vampire vs. lycan story and entertaining and there is rarely a slow area in this action packed film.

1947106,4,B0000UI2NM,"In this outing it is Vampire vs Lycan.  Lycanthrope being roughly werewolf.  I suspect between this movie and the colossal vampire story output by Anne Rice it was inevitable that any number of people would want to take this theme and idea in every direction imaginable.  This particular outing is not highbrow.

This one is action packed.  From the beginning were shooting 30 -40 -50 rounds out of a single 8-9 bullet clip in a pistol.  Then, how some of the bullet victims can appear to squeeze their sphincter and have the bullets crawl out of the holes theyve made in heads and bodies leaves me a bit curious, but it is kind of exciting.  I had to get used to the idea that some die and some dont, and I never really figured out why because the movie was moving so quickly, and was exciting, so I just forgot to care why.  And I think that is what this movie is shooting for exciting.  Unlike many shoot em up fun-arcade like movies, this one actually has a story line.  A PLOT!  Actually there are a few subplots going on as well. Mind you, the story isn't written by Jane Austen.

How about this there is enough plot left over to demand Volume II.  Lets raise the Pom-Poms for sequels.  Think Kate Beckinsale in tight black shiny leather and superhuman strength.  But ladies, don't cringe away from this one so quickly.  There is some kind of epic love thing going on here as well and plenty of love story novel cover type objects of affection.

So, you know it is a vampire vs. werewolf shoot em up story with a love story subplot.  What?  You want me to write the whole story?

I was entertained. Im not going to knock some taking liberty with things like how many bullets, and what can go through brick walls, or leap from high buildings.  With me...  I recently learned J. Michael Strazynski wrote Underworld #4, so Im starting again from the beginning as Ive never known JMS to write a bad script. This one earned its #4 by pure excitement and entertainment.  Sorry to the highbrows who think Bridges of Madison County is the only way to climb up to high ratings.",1382659200,,2074,4.41424802110818
1947107,5,B0000UI2NM,"The video has a great plot, good script, and good dialogue. Though a few things I saw could've been fixed. The graphics on the werewolves, good work, but needs more fur. There's this one scene where the black lycan was taking blades out of his shoulder, they made the mistake of putting the wound on the other side. They could have at least gave the werewolves tail, like in Howling.

As for the video itself, anyone who knows Shakespeare classic Romeo and Juliet, two clans fight over a long feud. All because of passion and love, since both are undead creatures, they almost mirrored Romeo and Juliet. Only this time, out a twist of werewolves and vampires.

Anyways, great story. This is my first time starting the series.",1380499200,,725,4.65625
1947108,2,B0000UI2NM,"Underworld is a sleek, stylish action/horror flick that did pretty well at the box office. It touted an appetizing lead and promised mucho action, slow mo movements, and an intriguing tale. While it did deliver on all this (and more), it didn't get my horror heart a pumping, mainly for the very reasons it boasted.
Don't get me wrong, sleep directing and beautiful cinematography usually go hand in  hand with a good movie, no matter what the genre. This is a good nod in the movies direction. I just couldn't find much substance under this shiny pearl. From point A to point Z, we have fighting,  quarreling, fighting, plot, combating, plot, and fighting some more. Much like the Matrix and Blade, the film focuses primarily on kicking skills over chilling skills. If you have vampires and lycanthropes in the mix, it's always a good idea to attempt some fear too.

As the plot unfolds, there is an old war between the fangs and the furries. Selene, who is the beautiful vampire assassin, finds out there is going to be an attempt by the sneaky werewolves to kidnap Michael Corvin, a human. This may help cease the war finally, but not in the way Selene wants it to end. Naturally she interferes, but her blood starts heating at the sight of the werewolf bitten human. Another plot obstacle is that she begins going against her people in her decisions.

 The story itself sounds good on paper and could have looked terrific on screen. Instead they chose to not pay enough attention to plot development. Action and plot intermingling has to be done carefully, or else you just get an all out action fest without much point, or an interesting story that doesn't have enough fight scenes to satisfy action hounds. It's a hard situation to beat, and frankly they didn't succeed here in the way I'd have liked. If the story were more developed, if I had cared more about some of the characters, and if more menace had been mixed with bite, I would have been a much happier camper.

Also, since one of the driving forces behind the plot is supposed to be a romantic love mess between Selene and the mortal, it was poorly unexplored. We gets hints here and there of this and that, but nothing in the face that shows us how truly valuable the love is to either. It's almost an afterthought and behind the scenes kind of deal. If this had been played up more in the story, I'd be delighted.

As with any movie of this form, weapons are galore. It's not just the moves the audience gets to drool over, it's the artillery. Our eyes get treated with supernatural critters being slayed with silver blade and bullets filled with such yummy substances as silver nitrate. Pretty cool stuff. The action sequences were fine as they stood; plenty of blustering and quarreling made stylish. Some of the scenes were heart racing and visually strong, I must give the movie credit for that.

For the acting, Kate Beckinsale was a great advertising tool. I'm sure many teenage (and adult) boys were itching to see the flick just to see the hot foreign actress in tight, black leather. To her credit, she does act well, but her character is relatively lifeless. I didn't see as emotion as I would have liked. It's spoken of what she goes through, and shown, but I didn't get the fear/drama/sadness from her personality alone. As an assassin that's determined and strong, she comes through here with shining colors. Lucian was the best of them all, as he had more character development and was someone I actually gave a damn about. He had a purpose, a motivation, and reasoning behind this was fulfilled. Way to go there. Bill Nighy as the resurrected ancient did his role very well.

While I didn't warm up to everything here, I have to get credit to the directing. Positively breathtaking. The film has a purposeful blue hue cast over it, painting it a gorgeous gothic shade. Doom and gloom is easily felt during each frame. The effects of Underworld were nothing short of amazing. Werewolves looked most convincing, without using much CGI. The blood and gore were plentiful enough to obtain an R rating, so this was a plus as well. The soundtrack is strong and pleasing to the ears, a great match.

Since we're dealing with vamps and wolves here I'd have preferred more fang versus claw. Instead we get weapons and guns, which in a way doesn't quite fit. Overall a movie that's shiny and sparkly but also lackluster. Could have been better than it was. As it stands, only an average flick that deserves a viewing or so, but not a buy.",1379635200,,4513,4.622971285892635

This movie manages to follow most of the cliches of the vampire lore, pitting them against werewolves who of course live in the dumps and are slightly less attractive.  Having said that it was great fun to watch.  Kate Beckinsale makes every scene she is in deep, dark and wonderful.  Even when she is posing gun forward, dodging bullets that seem to kill everyone to the left and right of her she is fabulous. She manages to pull off the perfect combination of badass and vulnerable that every great tough chick heroine needs. The look and feel of the movie is comic bookish and alluring, and holds up even though this movie is a few years old.  This movie pulls off campy and cool at the same time.

1947176,2,B0000UI2NM,"The extent of my ignorance of this genre, is illustrated by the fact that it wasn't until I read the Amazon explanation that I knew the film was not about a confusing mix of two kinds of vampire (with human beings playing some unidentified background role). Just how that reviewer gained insight into the murky situation I can't guess, but, not from the movie, I should think.  At any rate, you can see from this fact why my brief comment is directed only at others who do not hold a doctorate in Vampire-Werewolf studies.
So what about this battle between werewolves (for some reason the bad guys) and the vampires (for an equally obscure reason, the good guys, with one gal particularly prominent). It is about as interesting as a game of stickball between eight year olds. The Big Scene, at the very beginning, is a battle between two unidentified groups, in which we have no idea for whom to root, until Big Mama comes  along with her sleek ankle length coat and a pistol in each hand (which seems to fire more shots per second much more effectively than the guys could with their bigger weapons). From there it is all downhill,with the denouement being launched by resurrecting to life a dead old leader of the vampires, who is angry at the fact since it is a few days before his scheduled time (or did I misunderstand that?)
Well, that is my take on the going-ons, such as they were, but-naturally- I do not expect any  vampirologist to agree nor, yet, any werewolfen. I didn't recognize any of the players but assume they did the best they could with what they were given to work with.",1364860800,2,1592,4.54006968641115

1947192,2,B0000UI2NM,"I'm pretty baffled that this series is still going on.  It's kind of like the endless barrage of `Resident Evil' movies out there right now.  Like, why are these still being made?  The first film in each series was decent enough and yet not good enough to even warrant a sequel, let alone a third, fourth, whatever number they are on now.  Really, the fact that these movies are making money (are they?) is confusing to me.

But that's somewhat beside the point.

`Underworld' is an intriguing (sort of) concept that pits vampires against werewolves in a sort of mafia meets Victorian England setting where they scour the subways and kill each other.  Basically there is a war between the two, a war that has been going on for centuries.  These two species couldn't be more different (or more clich&eacute;d) and so we can see why they don't get along.  The Lycans (werewolves) are interested in a med student named Michael Corvin, and so obviously he becomes the interest of the Vampires as well, especially Selene.

Here's the thing; `Underworld' can verge on boring in parts and cheesy in the rest of them.  While Beckinsale looks amazing in a skin tight leather jumpsuit, and the scene where she shoots out the floor is pretty awesome, the action scenes are not that impressive, the CGI can lean towards campy and the chemistry between the two leads couldn't be staler.  The film is dressed up rather nicely, with some really nice production and costume design (Les Wiseman knows his way around a set, that's for sure) but the start to finish production is just off to me.  I walked out of the theater shrugging my shoulders and wishing that I had seen something else.

Style over substance is a real issue here, but sadly the style isn't exciting enough to make up for the lack of real story development.",1354579200,,1809,4.665615141955836
1947193,5,B0000UI2NM,"Celine is a vampire soldier. It's her job to fight the werewolves who have been hunted to near extinction. She is the adopted daughter of the Ruler of her covern, Viktor. While Viktor sleeps for several hundred years, the covern is ruled by his proxy. This vampire has betrayed his kind and is dealing with the werewolf leader, Lucian. Lucian is discovering how to create a hybrid werewolf/vampire. Michael is his subject. As Celine and Michael become closer, the war escalates. Her only choice is to awaken her father, Viktor. Viktor is pissed and personally goes to crush the werewolves and their collaborators. The only problem is, he will never accept Celine and Michael's relationship.

This is an excellent movie. In a world full of half baked horror/action movies, underworld shines brightly. A great cast, story, and awesome intensity shoot this film to the top of it's respective genre. Don't you dare miss it.",1354406400,,919,4.967532467532467

1947196,4,B0000UI2NM,"I just watched Underworld for the about the sixth or seventh time today and having watched all four numerous times, knowing the back story as well as I do now between Sofia and Michael, I am able to see so much more the story unfolded. I love the stylish production. When Selene, the female vampire of a coven somewhere near 1700 years old, finds a human and realizes the vampire's arch nemesis, Lucian is alive when she had been told all of her life he was dead (the rules are strict about delving into the past in Selene's world) she very much wants to know what the Lycans want from him. There appears to be nothing particularly different about him but the caretaker of their coven has been anything but vigilant with nightly bawdy parties and a total lack of oversight. This leaves Selene feeling uncomfortable and she senses a terrible danger ahead. Michael played very well by the sexy Scott Speedman, is the center of this story as this faction wants to merge the humans and Lycans biologically which was supposed to create a doubly strong, powerful entity and perhaps stop the thousand year war between these two very different races of beings. I am a great fan of Kate Beckinsale and I think she plays a brilliant part in a sometimes complex, but well directed movie. Bill Nighy, a delightful English actor who has played many wonderful parts plays Viktor, the elder whom Selene feels forced to ""wake up"" from his 300 or so year sleep is a viscious charactor who originally put this war in motion when *****SPOILER ALERT***** (for the five of you out there who hasn't yet seen it) he killed his daughter in an extremely barbaric way in the early days when the Lycans (werewolves) are basically used and abused by the vampires as slaves. The story, as I said is not just brilliant, but there is a beautiful love story between Lucian and his vampire wife, Sofia. When she dares get pregnant, Viktor, who is perhaps the very definition of rascism, will never let this hybrid child come to term and kills Sofia as noted above, in front of a chained and horrified Lucian. And so Lucian starts this terrible war.

There are four movies in this series. Best watch Underworld: Rise of the Lycans first although it was the third made in the series. Then go back and watch Underworld, Underworld Evolution and then Underworld Awakening although the last movie does not include Scott Speedman, which is sad. These movies are the story of the development of both races and the thrill of living a little bit inside their cruel, dark worlds. I thought I wouldn't like Rise of the Lycans which is set back many years and explains what happened and how these two races became such mortal enemies. But the powerful love story was simply done brilliantly and it is my second favorite in the series.

If you haven't indulged in this intelligent, stylish, very goth set of movies yet, I highly recommend you rent and watch or just buy the whole thing in a bundle. I never get tired of the Underworld movies. Definitely NOT for children. This is true ""adult"" entertainment. All movies send you on a fantastic thrill ride as the twists and turns just keep coming. Highly entertaining. Highly recommended!",1353024000,,3191,4.656028368794326

1947202,5,B0000UI2NM,"I don't know about you guys, but I love the Underworld series. This series, along with Blade is what made me a fan of vampires films. Before then, I wrote them off because most of them are love stories. What I failed to realize it that they should be love stories, and I had a misconception of what vampires were all about. Abraham (""Bram"") Stroker's original Dracula novel from 1897 was a love story through and through. Even Underworld is a love story at heart. The same argument could be made for Blade, since his love for his mother, and hatred for the monsters that stole her from him is what drove his quest for vengeance. Underworld is more like a Gothic Romeo and Juliet. The difference, and it's a big one, is that the second sexiest actress in the world stars as Selene. The first being Scarlett Johansson. And not only is the lead sexy, but the co-stars are two of my favorite British actors. I love Michael Sheen, and Bill Nighy is amazing. If Simon Pegg and Ian McKellen were in this, I don't know what I would do will all of that British awesomeness. Yes, I love the cast, but the action is pretty good in this movie as well. Comparisons to The Matrix have been made countless times. I don't blame anyone for doing so. Over the course of the franchise, Underworld has found its niche, and moved away from such comparisons.

The finale  in the first Underworld is quite well done, in my opinion. I do happen to love werewolves as well. They are only my favorite movie monsters in cinema history. In fact, I just recently watched An American Werewolf In London because I did not feel right calling myself a fan of the beast, not having seen ""The Best Werewolf Movie Of All-Time"". That said, I don't think they were at their best in this one. They moved too slow to me. I appreciate prostetics over CGI, but make it more believable at least. There is no way a real werewolf would walk straight at someone that slowly if they were shooting at, or whipping it. I can't hold that against the film too much though, because that's only of sign of Underworld's lower budget, especially compared to its sequels. Van Helsing, while it isn't the best film, has some of my personal favorite werewolves. That said, I still enjoyed the R&J-esque story, and how it combined the already connected lores.

The story is aided wonderfully by the dark tone and visuals. The gothic look was used perfectly. The vampires' home was a particularly well done set piece. As was the final set where the last fight took place. Speaking of that particular fight, I think it was a tad too short, but the choreography was nicely paced. It allowed you to see every detail, but it didn't move too slowly. I can say that for the entire film actually. The pacing is great, and the lack of quick-cuts allow to to become immersed in the Underworld universe. As a fan of the entire series, I may be biased. I can admit that I see the films' flaws, but still find much more to love in them. I don't blame anyone for not liking these movies, but I don't get the hate. I think it's a lot better than the reception it has received, and certainly worth a watch for anyone who likes vampires or werewolves. Also, you see how easy it is to write a review for vampire/werewolf love stories without bashing Twilight? Yes, it's very easy indeed. I think Twilight is just a female's version of this story. Even though the lead is a female, it is still a movie, or series that caters to a large male audience. And there isn't much that needs to be said for the picture and audio quality of the Blu-rays. Each film in the series is pretty much reference quality. Highly recommended.",1342396800,,3644,4.452095808383233

1947209,4,B0000UI2NM,"Mythology dates legends of vampires all the way back into ancient Rome, when the goddess Lamia was believed to punish those unfaithful to her by robbing them of their children in the night, and draining their blood. In the centuries since, vampires have both been hated and feared, but in recent times, also featured as empathetic heroes in comic books and film franchises. Underworld is the most successful.

A war has been raging for centuries between the lycans (a particular set of werewolves) and Vampires. Among the black-clad vampire warriors known as Death Dealers trained to defeat the enemy is Selene (Kate Beckinsale). Driven by an intense hatred for the werewolves that slaughtered her family in the middle ages, and a desire to please Viktor (Bill Nighy), her mentor and one of the three remaining elders, currently in a century-long hibernation, she relentlessly tracks and slays the enemy one by one. The lycans have taken a recent interest in a human, Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman), and the vampires desire to know why. Soon it will be the eve of the Awakening, when the vampires will gather to awaken Marcus, the next chosen elder meant to rule. The current leader of the coven is power driven Kraven (Shane Brolly), who seeks to pursue Selene as his future queen, but is jealously guarded by the equally determined Erika (Sophia Myles).

Lucian (Michael Sheen), ruler of the Lyrons, has been rumored to be dead for centuries, slain at Kraven's hand, but Selene becomes convinced he still lives. Michael is forced to be taken into confidence when he is repetitively hunted by werewolves, unraveling a dangerous train of events that lead to slaughter, destruction, betrayal, and torment as the coven is split apart through mistrust and rivalry. What results is an exciting two hours spent delving into the underground and the rivalry between feuding clans. If nothing else, the film is original and exciting. It features strong leading women, as well as memorable male counterparts, which makes it appeal to female audiences. It also doesn't overdo the gore factor, and is light on profane language. There are currently two versions of this film released to the general public. The R-rated edition is twenty minutes shy of the Unrated's full length, but the longer version gives a much more dynamic structure to the subplot involving Kraven and Erika. Because of this, and because the content isn't spiked too much, I am fonder of the longer version.

The brilliance on the part of the filmmakers is not the open ending, but the obscure references to the past history of the characters. It could easily fuel a pre-Underworld film series for its cluster of bloodthirsty fans.",1332892800,,2692,4.991091314031181

1947223,4,B0000UI2NM,"There were many things that made this movie great (and highly underrated) when it first came out. The soundtrack & special effects were fairly good, the fight scenes nice but reminiscent of the Matrix, the acting was decent - if a little trite. The plot was unique - not many movies out there have vampires VS werewolves (in this movie known as the ""Lycans"", for Lycanthropes: an incorrect term anyway, but it works) as their plotline, other than the old B-movies. The men (Speedman, Brolly & Sheen) and women are gorgeous: you should watch this movie if for nothing else than eye candy alone!
One of the main things I liked about this movie was its originality. Bullets invested with silver nitrate, the idea of ""death dealers"", the mixed bloodlines & all it entailed, the costumes (especially the vamp ones: Amelia's outfit was excellent), the realistic feel. Some of the movie could have been more developed - Beckinsale's relationship with Kraven and Michael, Marcus' character/role, etc. Fans of the comic (pretty true to the screen version) are given a little more info & the sequel is in production, complete with more Marcus info. Highly recommended!",1316736000,,1158,4.943589743589744
1947224,4,B0000UI2NM,"I could not wait to get in to the theater to see this film, as I'm a huge horror fan, but more specifically, a huge Werewolf fan & running a close second, Vampires. So a movie pitting the two against each other was just to much for me to resist! Was I disappointed?

Hell, no!

Despite all the bad rap this movie got as a horror clone to ""The Matrix,"" fighting sequences, guns, the Vampire's black dress, especially, Selene's, this movie is it's own film. Filled with action, great effects, good story line, & fast paced, ""Underworld"" put a stake right through my heart! Especially good was Michael Sheen's character, ""Lucian,"" feral, but sophisticated, he stole the show as the leader of the Lycans. Also particularly good was Bill Nighy's, ""Viktor,"" one of the three leaders of the Vampire clan. His character was at once commanding, intelligent, & sublimely evil, all that you could want from a Vampire!

Kate Beckinsale's main character, ""Selene,"" was very well done in portraying hard determination of hunting Lycan's without mercy. Digging out Kraven's plans to take over the Vampire clan using Lycans, but also an undeniable vulnerability toward Scott Speedman's other main character, ""Michael Corvin."" Michael Corvin was descended from the original immortal, Alexander Corvinus, who the Lycans feel will end the long war between them & the Vampires, by combing the cells of the two species into a super hybrid.

Also in this Blu-ray version there is about an extra five minutes of footage that really helps flesh things out.

I do have some complaints though. Scott Speedman's, ""Michael Corvin"" character was the weakest link in the chain acting wise, but I suppose in retrospect this was intended, for he had not a clue what was happing to him. Shane Brolly's character, ""Kraven"" was shrill & shallow, one wonders how he could orchestrate a coup over the Vampire clan, but also in retrospect, his character seems to fit in with the movie the more times it's viewed. I was disappointed in the lack of tooth & fang Vampire, Lycan confrontation, opting instead for guns & technology, but then again, retrospect wise, we don't fight our wars with sticks & stones anymore, so why should the Vampires & Lycans? One more thing, where are the female Lycans? Not nary a one to be seen in this film? With all this hairy tooth & fang machismo ""Rin Tin Tin"" going on, I think these male werewolves would enjoy a little soft furry support from a hot Lassie???

All in all though, this movie satisfies the horror fan in me, there is some flaws, but only enough for me to fault this movie very little. If you want hot Vampire vs. Werewolf action, this is the place to start!

1947225,1,B0000UI2NM,"This movie has been described as an action romance loosely based on ""Romeo and Juliet"" by reviewers who either don't care about the actual content of the movie or haven't spent the money to see it. For those expecting a love story, look somewhere else. ""Underworld"" does indeed translate the background of Shakespeare's tragedy into sci-fi terms: the feuding Montagues and Capulets have become vampire and werewolf clans, and Romeo and Juliet themselves are supernatural killing machines. The difference between the 14th century Italian and 21st century gothic tales is that ""Underworld"" is composed of characters too tough and serious to ever express love. If Selene (vampire) and Michael (werewolf) are hiding their emotions, they are doing so in a manner too subtle to catch my attention. Luckily, numerous dialogues between Selene and her vampire kin have been placed to fill in the blanks as to her apparent affections, since the entire cast has caught on to what viewers will miss. By the time they make physical contact - an unexpected scene lasting under a minute - this element of the movie is no longer surprising or interesting. These characters have no chemistry together, and the supposed romance is hardly mentioned again in leu of more threatening problems.

For those of you who loved the style and swiftness of this movie but wanted more affection, there may be a light at the end of the tunnel. ""Underworld"" ends with an obvious sequel offering, and the buzz is that this movie will again find inspiration in Shakespeare. Although the plot remains a mystery, ""Underworld Crimson: Masquerade Werepocalypse"" is expected to boast further historical depth into the warring vampire and werewolf clans as well as loosely mimic ""A Midsummer Night's Dream.""",1314403200,,1767,5.114186851211072

1947227,4,B0000UI2NM,"Six years before ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" fully revealed the origins of a war between vampires and lycans, we were flung head-long into the fray with 2003's surprise hit ""Underworld"".

""Underworld"" follows Selene (Kate Beckinsale), a vampire who is a member of an elite group of lycan hunters known as ""Death Dealers"". As the centuries-old blood feud between the two races rages on, Selene and her fellow vampires believe that the lycans' days are numbered. However, when an unsuspecting human (Scott Speedman) becomes the focal point of the conflict; everything Selene believes about the war, her heritage, and her mission may change forever.

Upon its release ""Underworld"" presented audiences with a new take on vampires and lycans (typically known as werewolves). Long gone are the days of Bela Lugosi's undeniably iconic ""Dracula"" or Lon Chaney, Jr's ""The Wolf Man"". Now, we are presented with vampires decked out in sleek, leather outfits, packing modern-day weaponry and martial arts influenced fighting styles. Plus, lycans that have never looked as menacing or believable as they do in this film.

Not to mention, the lycans' transformations (a nearly seamless blend of CGI and practical effects) are some of the best committed to film to this day. One thing is for sure, these are supernatural beings and monsters for the new, post-""Matrix"" generation of moviegoers.

Written by Danny McBride (""Underworld: Rise of the Lycan"") the film wastes little time jumping into both the main crux of the story (i.e. the specifics of the two races, the war, and so on) and the fast-paced, hard-hitting action sequences. For the most part the story does a terrific job in balancing the plot with the action, interspersed with brief tidbits of the history between the two races. However, at times the plot feels a little too rushed in order to keep the momentum going, resulting in some uneven, almost jumbled aspects to the story.

That being said, in the end those moments are overshadowed by the fact that Danny McBride did an excellent job of crafting a story that introduced us to a complicated war between supernatural beings. While the director, Len Wiseman (""Live Free or Die Hard"") skillfully guided the story to cinematic life complete with style, an eerie atmosphere that blended the familiar with the supernatural, and a terrifically cast group of actors and actresses.

Speaking of the cast, let's begin with actress Kate Beckinsale (""Pearl Harbor"") as the leather-clad vampire Selene. Kate's performance was generally stoic and emotionless, which makes sense given she is portraying a member of the so-called undead. However, there were some brief glimpses of newfound emotions boiling to the surface and Kate's handling of Selene's bewilderment to the aforementioned was completely natural and effortless.

Also, seeing a female vampire doing a majority of the action was an interesting change of pace for this type of film, but a welcome one at that. Kate handled herself in the action sequences in such a strong, confident manner that she quickly solidified her character as one not to be messed with.

Actor Scott Speedman (""Dark Blue"") was good in the role of Michael, the human that the lycans are focused upon. However, I did find that occasionally his acting felt a little forced. Perhaps he was over-rehearsed so that the scenes couldn't flow naturally for him. Even so, acting wise I don't believe he is up to par with some of the other, more accomplished cast members.

Of course, the fact that a vampire/werewolf movie actually has acting that was good enough to set standards for the entire cast is surprising in itself (at least in my estimation). That alone should indicate that this film is not just another one of your typical, run-of-the-mill monster films where the acting is the last thing on anyone's mind. This film's cast actually seemed to take pride in getting their characters right and making them interesting to the audience, while still holding true to the archetypes being portrayed.

Speaking of those cast members that set the aforementioned acting bar; aside from Kate Beckinsale, we have the two talented actors chosen to play the respective leaders of the two races, actors Bill Nighy and Michael Sheen.

As the vampire king, Viktor, veteran actor Bill Nighy (""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"") commands both respect and fear with his portrayal that was at times endearing, but could then be utterly cold, calculating and undeniably evil. His layered performance elevated the character of Viktor from being just another one-dimensional despot to a complicated being that was very real despite his supernatural disposition.

The ever-reliable actor Michael Sheen (""Frost/Nixon"") as Lucian, leader of the lycans, brought a quiet strength to the role that belied the ferocity lurking just beneath the surface. His performance was laced with such subtle malevolence, so that whenever his character would snap and unleash the inner beast it was almost startling; despite the fact you knew it had to happen at some point.

With such generally strong performances, fast-paced action and stunts, and solid storytelling, ""Underworld"" is without a doubt an excellent monster movie in every sense. The film successfully brings a centuries-old war between supernatural beings to life in a way that is interesting and above all, entertaining.

""Underworld"" is rated R for violence and language.",1305590400,,5445,5.158730158730159

1947240,4,B0000UI2NM,"""Underworld"" is one of those movies that I can watch just about any time. While some horror purists may take exception to the folklore surrounding the vampires and werewolves portrayed in the move, I think the minor changes are logical and work well, with the exception that the vampires are a lot weaker than they should be.

No plot spoilers from me; the movie centers on the centuries long struggle between vampires and werewolves. On the surface, the vampires appear to have the upper hand with squads of ""Death Dealers"" (including Kate Beckinsale)  hunting down the werewolves. The twist comes when the werewolves appear to become interested in human target, for purposes other than eating him.

The movie has a great dark atmosphere that gives a gothic feel even though it is set in the current time (except for the flashbacks). The cinematography is very good and the special effects are generally well done and certainly not over used. The acting is fairly good and Kate Beckinsale is clearly the star of this movie.

1947250,2,B0000UI2NM,"Underworld is a film that continues to water down vampires as most of us know them.  This process began with Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles, but these stories still retained the horrific true nature of vampires even with a more relatable, human face.  Now we come to this day where between Buffy the Vampire Slayer (which I did enjoy) and Twilight (hate with burning passion) we have films in the middle of this watered down vampire genre that many have grown used to.  There's the good humanized vampires (Anne Rice), the bad (Twilight), and then there's the ones that just fall right dab in the middle and that would be where I'd place Underworld.

The movie itself starts off with our heroine Selene doing her best to try and look like The Crow or an extra from The Matrix while she gives us a monologue on how the vampires and werewolves (which for some reason this movie has titled ""Lycans"").  She explains that she's a ""Death Dealer"" meaning that she hunts down the remaining Lycans.  Instantly we have her and another guy (we'll guess that in their exchange of head nodding he's also a Death Dealer) jumping down from the top of buildings and landing without harm on the concrete below...how convenient it is that no one saw them.

We then somehow get this character of Michael Corvin involved as some...truly boring individual.  So when the vampires discover the Lycans have been following him so they soon send Selene to investigate it.  Selene and Corvin of course end up being together and escape the Lycans.  Does this mean we finally get a Vampire+Human buddy action film?  Of course not!  As awesome as that could have been Corvin has been bitten by a Lycan and monster 101 dictates he shall soon become one.  Now we realize the true plot intent of this movie is to be some strange, leather clad Romeo & Juliet.

The rest of the plot...quite frankly bored me to tears.  Nothing in this movie ever paused itself to try and make sense!  They kept twisting subjects around and around, showed weird aspects of vampire society that may seem cool to eyes but they never really got any elaboration other than ""here's this cool thing, now let's try for something completely different.""  It just wasn't a coherent storyline.

Vampirism just isn't shown well in this movie.  Remember the days of Dracula, or even the adaptation of Interview with the Vampire some years back?  That should remind you vampires, and their bite are more sexual than anything else.  In Underworld there is zero sensuality in this act and it pretty much is only shown for the blood.

Kate Beckinsale is really attractive, but looks just can't save this film.  There is no chemistry between the leads and most of the cast seems bored.  No one really gets my attention in this film because they are all so very bland.  When the plot gets chugging along it has far too many characters to keep track of and when we finally discover the true villain of the film we are greeted to the most anti-climactic final confrontation I have seen in recent cinema.

Now I will grant it the film does have some really good sets that obviously had quality work put into them, but that can't save the fact that the plot is a mess and the characters are unremarkable.  The director is essentially trying to knock-off Blade, The Matrix, and The Crow off all while in the same movie and it clearly shows in his awkward style as he tries desperately to replicate techniques that worked well in previous films of the genre.  So if you want a somewhat fun action movie this show is for you, but don't be expecting anything new, or for that matter even anything all that entertaining.",1259798400,,3639,4.634945397815913

I keep finding new subtle things in the movie overlooked in my first viewing. This movie is the starter for a 3 movie collection. Telling some of the history and moving forward with this story. Underworld and Underworld Evolution move the story further in time while the third movie tells the history of how we got here.

The story is about two races of beings, the upper class Vampires and the worker class Werewolves. In the old times, the races lived together in harmony, now they are at war. This story focuses on ""a human"" who we later learn has characteristics of both races and his blood is valuable to both races. Of course, our lead character (Kate Beckinsale) needs the help of a sleeping vampire lord. A very impressive movie with stunning visual look. Once you finish Underworld, keep on going with Evolution and Rise of the Lycans. Highly recommended and added to my list of favorite movies.",1258243200,,1073,4.617801047120419
1947253,4,B0000UI2NM,This is one of my favorites and best vampire movies. There are a few flaws to the movie but can be over looked. In one's opinion vampires are stronger or just as strong as Lykens. Some of the elder vampires seems frail in this movie. But that can be over looked with cool scenes and a great story line.,1255737600,,302,4.135593220338983
1947254,5,B0000UI2NM,"Hello

I've watched all three movies in SD and HD on the Dish. We have the newest title on BD and after reading the reviews of both BD and DVD version I decided to grab this in Blu-Ray. The reviews I've read both pro and casual pretty much sum up my thoughts, this is a very good transfer in both image and sound. Let me break it down into two groups....

Image and visual - With the ""Underworld"" series don't expect a dazzeling colorful display. Instead it's a world of darks and grey with a touch of gothic appeal. While for some that may not be such a good thing it does show a great deal of contrast involving blacks against skin tones. And this is where this movie shines above all others. It has a great blend with surprising detail in this contrast especially with Kate Beckinsale dressed in black leather, with pitch black hair and a pale skin face. But it's all thruout the movie from the buildings, stone, chains, the rainy weather; the whole Underworld experience really shows up well with it's black & grey theme.

Sound - I was really surprised how well the DD 5.1 track did on this. Most will say, ""oh well it's a gun battle here and there and what do you expect"". Well that's just it, there's allot more. It's basically everywhere from the rain falling, to metal locks turning, splashes of water while running thru it, chains clanging and so on. One particular scene involved one Vampire with two whips lashing out at a Werewolf coming at him. It was if the whips were snapping back & forth side-to-side. And yes there are gun battles and plenty of them. The low end gets about an average workout but this is not Saving Private Ryan. It would've been extra icing if there was a DTS track.

Overall I would grade this close to ""Reference Quality"" for showing off BD and Sound. The high level of contrast with blacks and skin detail makes this a BD Standout. Sound wise a excellent choice for those who enjoy action and want it loud. Highly Recommended",1254614400,,1965,4.434903047091413

I Have Just Finished Watching The Movie And All I Can Say And Think Is ""AMAZING""!!!
The Picture And Sound Are Simply Incredible.

This Is The Type Of Movie They Would And Should Use At An Electronics Store To Demonstrate The Advantage Blu-Ray Has In Both Its Picture And Sound Over Standard DVD.

Not To Overlook The Incredible Story Line,Acting,And Computer Generated Graphics. This Was A Movie That Drew Me In From The Beginning And Never Let Me Go Until The End Credits Rolled.

I Am Looking Forward,Now,To See The Sequel ""Underworld Evolution"".
 If You Get Only One Sci-Fi/Horror Movie On Blu-Ray Give This Movie Serious Consideration.

The camera work adds to the adreniline on the action sequence. But what really caught my attention was the romeo/juliet thread throughout the movie. In a reversal of natural rolls, Selene is the romeo, the stronger, protective lead in this vampire/human turned lycan relationship. Where as, Michael plays an excellent girlfriend. :)

Not only do vampires and werewolves make for interesting and entertaining protagonists and antagonists, but they also make for some pretty cool and imaginative fight scenes.

If you enjoy action films with great fighting, but not really all that much blood, gore and guts, this would be a great film to pursue. The action is fast-paced, the cast is attractive, and the special features are very interesting, all at a great price. Would fully recommend!",1236211200,,610,4.700934579439252

1947274,3,B0000UI2NM,"This is an interesting film which maintains a fine dark gothic feel, blended with elements of the modern thrown in for good measure as well. They could have just called it ""Vampires vs Werewolfs"", because essentially this just takes the idea from Aliens vs Predators and transposes it for use with two of the best known gothic horror icons.

Where it lets itself down is the lack of character development. Yes it has plenty of action. You certainly won't be dissapointed on that front. After a while though you know when you see a lot of people walking purposefully, that they are going to end up in one hell of a fight with or without guns and it happens over and over. In the end I really didn't what happened to any of the characters...

One clear influence is The Matrix. The start of the film is almost a direct copy of a famous scene from that film. Many of the characters walk around in long black leather coats which is also a Matrix influence. That said this does have a considerable amount of style and I will be quite happy to watch this again.",1233878400,,1055,4.4051282051282055

I loved it!  The conflict, while comfortingly familiar (vamps vs. werewolves), is presented with great twists rendering it refreshingly different than the bloodfest movie I thought it would be.

I love the characters, the mystery, and the cultures created around these two enemy races.  The main characters are flawed, yet prevail.  And what could be better than a little romance mixed in with the monsters?  The sequel wasn't quite as good, but was still enjoyable.  I'll be in line at the movie theater when the third installment is realeased later this year.",1232582400,,745,4.598484848484849

1947279,3,B0000UI2NM,"I really, really liked the theatrical release of Underworld, so when I finally got a Blu Ray player I picked it up on blu ray pretty quickly.  While the visual and audio is fantastic, I wish they had not added in the extra footage.  None of it was relevant or really entertaining--I don't need to see Kraven and that blond floozy making out for 6 minutes at a stretch (I'm not a prude, but jeez, it was BORING--no T&A, no character development or plot advancment...what the heck?).  The rest of the extra footage was pretty much the same--pointless and boring. There were bits and pieces of scattered throughout, but it really all belonged on the cutting room floor. It made the movie less enjoyable for me.

The picture quality was great, the audio quality was great...but I just want the theatrical release, not the extended. There's a reason stuff gets edited!",1231286400,,863,4.695364238410596

Once I got past all Beckinsale dressed up in a tight-fitting PVC catsuit (Every man's dream!) I realized that this was a pretty well-developed movie. In terms of its story, it's been done before; but I am a sucker for the Westside Story/vampire werewolf love angle. As the movie moved along, I became impressed by its level of creativity and invention. And it's a beautifully styled film as well. In the extended cut, we are treated to lots of extras, included a very entertaining audio commentary by the director, Beckinsale, and Scott Spedman.

1947282,4,B0000UI2NM,"Synthesize elements from famous film franchises like ""The Crow,"" ""The Matrix,"" and ""Blade"" to forge a bullet-riddled, revisionist vampires-vs.-werewolves urban war epic, and you'll have a pretty good idea what to expect from the exciting, new, fantasy chiller ""Underworld"" (*** out of *****) starring ""Pearl Harbor"" beauty Kate Beckinsale. This supercharged but synthetic British horror thriller with R-rated heaps of blood & gore and a touch of Shakespeare plays fast and loose with vampire lore. Not only do the vamps refrain from shape shifting into bats, but also these pale-faced bloodsuckers can stare at their reflections in the mirror! Were that not enough these fangsters don't have to shack up for the day in their caskets. On the other hand, rookie director Len Wiseman and stuntman-turned-scenarist Danny McBride adhere to the lycanthrope legend with no radical departures.

Action-packed from the outset, this darkly-lensed, tragic melodrama laid in a rain swept contemporary setting provides enough different things along the way with a couple of major plot revelations to boost ""Underworld"" above its formulaic origins. For example, the vampires load their automatic weapons with silver nitrate slugs, while the werewolves pack cartridges filled with ultra-violet light to literally let daylight through their sworn enemies. The special effects sequences that depict the transformation from man into werewolf look super cool, and the sight of these scary creatures hauling butt on the walls in pursuit of their prey make for vivid, memorable images. One especially clever scene shows a werewolf as he uses his bodily powers to pop the bullets out of his wounds!

Although it runs a little over two hours, ""Underworld"" maintains enough momentum in its melodramatic narrative and features strong enough villains that it entertains you without giving you nightmares. Surprisingly, though it looks like it should have descended from a graphic novel, ""Underworld"" boasts no previous source material aside from an original story penned by black stuntman-turned-actor Kevin Grevioux, former ""Stargate"" art director Wiseman, and McBride himself. When the bullets aren't thudding noisily in your ears, ""Underworld"" features a deafening, industrial-strength, orchestral soundtrack written by ex-Tangerine Dreamer Paul Haslinger with songs written by David Bowie and Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciate. Get ready to rock out!

Kate Beckinsale plays a super-sexy leather-clad vampire warrior named Selene who cannot kill enough werewolves to satisfy her thirst for vengeance. Vampires and werewolves have been fighting a no-holds-barred civil war for centuries, and the vampires finally appear to have gotten the upper hand over the Lycans. According to Selene, these hideous Lycans wiped out her entire family and would have killed her too had it not been for vampire elder Viktor (Bill Nighy of ""Hitler's S.S.: Portrait in Evil"") who saved her life and turned her into a vampire. Meanwhile, as Viktor rests in his tomb, his hand-picked protg Craven (Shane Brolly of ""Impostor"") appears to have turned traitor to his own kind. Secretly, Kraven has been negotiating a truce behind the scenes with the Lycans who are trying to develop a serum which will enable Lycans and vampires to mate.

Naturally, when Selene awakens Viktor and reveals Kraven's insidious plot, all hell breaks loose. Furthermore, it doesn't help matters that the apparently whipped Lycans are far from whipped as Selene learns in an opening shoot-out in a subway tunnel. No, human society doesn't know about the millennium war happening right under their noses, because the vampires and werewolves conceal themselves so well. In fact, the vampires maintain their own blood bank, so they don't have to bleed humans dry. Once a rebellious Selene resurrects Viktor to punish the treacherous Kraven, the action really slams into high gear.

Despite Kraven's assurances to the contrary that the werewolves have been eliminated as a threat, Selene sets out to convince Viktor that the werewolves are staging a comeback. Nothing can stop our hardnosed heroine from proving her point, even if she must turn against her own breed. Apparently, the Lycans have found a human, Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman of ""Duets"") who can assimilate both vampire and werewolf DNA so as to reproduce. Complications arise when Michael saves Selene's life, and she finds herself attracted to him. In ""Underworld,""

Director Len Wiseman, who served as art director not only on the theatrical ""Stargate"" but also ""Independence Day,"" makes the most of his threadbare $20-million production so that ""Underworld"" can compete with the films that inspired it. Set amid gloomy, Gothic castles where the elitist vampires huddle in their fight against evil, ""Underworld"" stresses adrenaline-laced action with just enough time out for the exposition to keep audiences on track about who's who. While the characters aren't as substantial as they could be, each shows a different side as the plot approaches its climax. Selene changes from a mindless werewolf killer from the get-go when she learns the truth about her family and the heroic vampire who saved her from sure death. Tucked away in the flashbacks is another story that revolves around the villainous Viktor that explains his hatred of all things Lycan.

Surprisingly, for a British-produced movie, ""Underworld"" ignores sex, nudity, and romance in favor of bloodletting and mutilation. Although it cannot compare with ""The Crow,"" ""The Matrix,"" and ""Blade,"" ""Underworld""manages nevertheless to carve out a niche of its own, if only because it is a British production. The fact that the Brits were able to produce their own variation on these popular, special effects laden spectacles is reason enough to watch it. Unfortunately, like the vampires here who refuse to countenance interspecies breeding, nearly 90 per cent of American film critics have staked out this well-made thriller because they feel it offers nothing new and lacks the polished production values of those other film franchises. Truth is that getting a large scale action film like ""Underworld"" made in England by Englishmen amounts to something like a miracle.

While it doesn't look as polished as ""The Crow,"" ""The Matrix,"" and ""Blade,"" ""Underworld"" still ranks a good horror thriller that you can sink your teeth into and enjoy for its vitality.",1227657600,3,6425,5.379721669980119

1947289,4,B0000UI2NM,"UNDERWORLD, a faced-paced, in your face, kick-a** monster movie, tries to answer that age old question.  Vampires and Lycans (werewolves) have been at war for untold centuries.  Very few even remember how the blood feud started.  But the crossing of a Vamp with a Lycan has always been forbidden.  Or has it?

UNDERWORLD is action-packed from the get go; you jump right in and it never lets up.  Epic battles, high-speed chases, gun fights, impossible stunts, blood and gore (although less than you would think), and fantastic transformations keep you on the edge of your seat.  The directing/cinematography/editing are excellent, cutting away from anything truly disgusting before you really see it; leaving the rest to your vivid imagination.  The acting is impressive, with Kate Beckinsale, Scott Speedman, and Michael Sheen all giving scene-stealing performances.  The rest of the cast, including Bill Nighy, are equally good in there respective roles.  And let me just say, the costuming for UNDERWORLD is marvelous:  gorgeous dresses, fabulous leathers, skin-tight cat suits.  I'd like to go shopping were the Vamps do!

UNDERWORLD includes all the universal Vampire and Werewolf lore - sunlight kills Vamps, silver kills Lycans, you become a Vampire or a Werewolf from a bite.  Not too many surprises in this area (although these precepts are taken to new heights), making it easier to keep up with the plot.  But added to the standard lore is the theory that there is a line of humans who carry a gene that enables them to survive a bite from BOTH a Vampire and a Lycanthrope.  And this is what the Lycans are looking for.

Even if you aren't a fan of monster flicks, you will enjoy UNDERWORLD.  It makes for a great popcorn evening at home.  It is clearly too intense for the youngest members of the family, but tweens and up should be just fine.

So, what DO you get, when you cross a Vampire with a Lycanthrope?  Apparently, something the Lycans want and the Vampires don't.  And something bigger and badder than both...",1216944000,3,2031,4.911764705882353

I remembered this about my original viewing of the movie and I will say that the HD quality improved it slightly. Foremost in my mind is the overall terrible movie that this is.

I love this movie so to get more insight into the story by getting to see more footage is very rewarding. There were a couple of parts that I could have done without but this one shows more story and a bit a skin. The former being very interesting to me because I really dig the story and this one definitely provides more insight to the characters themselves.

Now, onto the disk itself.  First, the cut of this movie seems to be the extended unrated cut, or something similar to it, so if you missed out on that the first go around, this is your chance to see it.

The transfer, in my humble opinion, is absolutely lovely.  Everything looked great on my 60 inch Sony Bravia.  I especially love how much additional kick the blue-ish color palette (chosen intentionally by the director) receives in this transfer.

I have the special edition of the DVD version (the first released) and the unrated Blu-ray version.  My experience has been that DVDs mastered in high definition look identical to the Blu-ray version (either on a Blu-Ray player or an upconvert DVD player).  Underworld is no exception.  This was my first Blu-ray movie and I put both versions in at the same time (Blu-ray and an upconvert player for the DVD) and kept flipping back and forth between the inputs.  I couldn't tell the difference.  Both had great detail.

The unrated Blu-ray version had a few extra scenes that helped to explain why the blond vampire helped Selene at one point, but it wasn't critical.  Both versions have good special features.  They seem nearly identical, but the Blu-ray version might have one or two small additions.

If you have a DVD version you probably need not buy the Blu-ray version.  If you are buying for the first time, the DVD version will be less expensive, but Blu-ray discs are supposed to resist wear better.  Your call.",1203206400,8,1077,4.762162162162162

Vulgar, lacking in brainpower and inspiration (unlike the wonderful old mad doctors and madmen, who made you think they were more reasonable than the ""sane"" people around them), the horror film has been hijacked just like the good values of a religion giving way to the rages of fanatics and fundamentalists. But, I found Underworld to be an exception. Fast paced, an attempt at a sensible story, and it contains conflict that one can relate to from all opposing characters. At some point, you almost wonder who is right and who is wrong. Great looking film (with focus as sharp as a tack), especially well done considering that it is night throughout most of the movie. Except for the dialogue often being buried and hard to understand without blasting your ears into deafness, the sound  mix is, otherwise, fantastic.

The werewolves pursue an age old legend of a wolf and a vampire combining into one species. It's definitely an interesting idea combining two of the best horror species and the movie allows for some definite eye candy moments.

Okay, so, well, it's Kate Beckinsale in skintight leather with big guns. And that's a reason to watch just about anything. The question is, is there anything else about this movie worth watching? I'm not entirely sure whether I can give a definitive answer to that question, but I'm leaning towards ""no"".

The plot-- what there is of it-- revolves around Selene (Kate Beckinsale), a vampire from a clan who've been at war with a clan of werewolves (known as the Lyken, because in Hollywood, everything is cooler if you shorten it), heade dby the enigmatic Lucian (Michael Sheen) for a long, long time. And, well, I'd have to go well into the second half of the movie to give you more of a plot summary than that, because it takes this movie forever to actually come up with a plot. (When it does arrive, it's a rather loose definition of the term anyway.) The main thing you need to know is that a human medical student, Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman), gets in the way.

Perhaps I'm giving the movie short shrift, and when it was originally conceived, there was a much stronger, more coherent storyline. Still, that's not what we ended up getting. Yeah, things finally start coming together about an hour and twenty minutes into the movie, but for the first hour and twenty minutes, there's really not much to do but stare at Kate Beckinsale in skintight leather with big guns. And, you know, even that can get old. (Substitute ""Charlize Theron"" and AEon Flux, and there you go.) Definitely not one I'll be rewatching. **",1185926400,,1554,4.684981684981685

This movie (in my opinion) will become a classic.  Whether it becomes a mainstream classic or just a solid cult-classic remains to be seen.  The story is very well written and as someone pointed out, it revolves around WHY there is a war between vampires and werewolves and less on the creatures themselves.

The acting is just about as superb as it can get.  In my opinion not led by Beckinsale, but rather by Bill Nye who plays a very convincing Viktor.  Slight over-acting in spots by Speedman, but overall he plays very well off of the rest of the cast.

The directing is just as superb.  It is over the top with the effects but only in the spots where it is needed.  Enhancing the story, excitement, and tension all inter-twining the characters and their respective stories as to how the war began and where it will go.  The ending leaves the option for a sequel (which we now see is the case) and it keeps the viewer hooked for the next chapter!

And yet there is something that floats over the whole thing, that survives the animal horror that animates these pictures and bleak places. Two species have been fighting for centuries and the salvation of both is in a new blood line that will cross the two different ones. Peace can only come from crossing the bloodlines of the two rivals, the two enemies, the two antagons. And that works, in the film of course, because in reality if it were that simple...! It has been noticed that when a civil war starts we never know when it will stop. It took some thirty years for the latest episode of the Irish civil war to come to maybe an end and that was only the last episode of a war that was started by the invasion and conquest of Ireland by the English three or four centuries ago. And I will not speak of the Bosnian or Kosovar conflicts, nor of the opposition between Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq and in the world. But that's the optimistic final scene of a film that targets teenagers when war comes to an end because the two bloodlines have been mixed in the veins of a new leader. Yet I found the film a little bit long and repetitive as for the fighting scenes.

1947349,4,B0000UI2NM,"A few years ago I caught a late-night ""documentary"" about vampires and werewolves. I use inverted commas because, as it turned out, it was not so much a documentary as a wanna-be Blair Witch-style promo for Underworld. It was slick, cheesy, manipulative and deceptive, and it gave me a low opinion of Underworld, which I decided I would never bother to see.

Flash-forward a few years: I see a cheap double set of Underworld and Underworld Evolution, and, being in the mood for something spectacular and stupid, I buy it. I get more than I bargain for. While Underworld doesn't pretend to be anything more than a ""ride"", it's the best movie of this type that I've seen in a while. It doesn't treat the audience like kids, it has a unique vision well executed, and it has some fine performances (Michael Sheen in particular is a nice find).

Although it is not a straight rip-off, it is not unfair to describe Underworld as ""Matrix with werewolves and vampires"". They do have similar looks (bluish tinge instead of green), lots of long black leather coats, and gunfights with rubble flying everywhere. But the setting and story are quite different, and there is less CGI. (Unfortunately, like the Matrix, the sequel is ruined by a bad script.)

The story is an interesting update on the horror archetypes, with emphasis more on action than horror. (The special bullets are a surprisingly neat idea.) There are a couple of weak performances on the vampire side, but Beckinsale, Nighy and Sheen are good, and Speedman is okay in a part which doesn't have much depth written into it. There are a couple of misjudgements in the direction of the performances, but these are small things that most people won't notice, and it's still damned impressive for a first-time director.

One thing, and it's not really a complaint, more a question of accuracy in advertising: The vampires aren't particularly ""vampiry"" - you know, that whole ""living on human blood"" thing. It would hardly affect the movie if they were called Atlanteans, say, or Illuminati, instead of vampires. This isn't really a negative, but it may annoy people who expect to see traditional vampires in this film.

EDIT: Since this review, the third film, Rise of the Lycans, has come out. The critics hated it, but I loved it. First-time director Patrick Tatopoulos did a terrific job (he did FX on the first two movies). The result was very dark, intense and claustrophobic, but enjoyable because of the production value and the acting. In particular, it was great to see Nighy and Sheen back and chewing the scenery. Nighy was awesomely over-the-top (""You have betrayed me... to be with an a-ni-mal!""), and as for Sheen, wow, is that really the same guy who played Tony Blair? So I'd rank Lycans at least equal with the first film, and much better than the second and fourth ones.",1165104000,,2840,4.7877551020408164
1947350,3,B0000UI2NM,"Kate Beckinsale is stunning in this - take her out and the movie kinda falls flat. The story's nothing special. The effects are decent, but nothing ground-breaking. The acting is capable. The premise of werewolves fighting vampires is cool, but a more involving plotline would've been even cooler. (Can't say more without spoilers.)

All in all it got the level of acclaim it deserved and nothing more. Worth seeing, but instantly forgettable.",1162339200,,443,5.152777777777778
1947351,4,B0000UI2NM,"In this thriller, Vampires are at war with the Lycans {werewolves}, who were kept as slaves until in a very Romeo and Julet scenario, Elder Vampire ""Viktor"" slays his own daughter in front of her werewolf lover who goes on to wage a battle to avenge her death.  Here, The Vampires are aristocratic libertines presiding in opulent lairs while the Lycans are more or less street thugs residing under the city.

Subsequently, the Lycans formulate a plan to mix vampire and werewolf DNA to create a master warrior who would destroy the vampires once and for all. Lucian, the leader of the Lycans, sets his sights on a mortal named 'Michael' to be transformed into this champion for them. It is seen that this warrior represents the ""son"" ""Lucian"" never had, who himself falls in love with 'Selene', an attractive lycan-hunter, which stirs contention with Kraven, lord of the Vampire castle who stands as vampire ruler, whose reign is less than acceptable to Emperor Viktor, once he is awakened by Selene and becomes aware of the potentially dangerous situation brewing with the Lycans, which can effectively end their existence.

Armed with silver nitrate bullets, Selene and a handful of vampires go forth to decimate these werewolves, before they reach them and tear them to pieces. One of the more gorey scenes involves a massacre within a train.

Confused by the changes he is experiencing and impelled by his growing fascination with this shadowy underworld as well as an infatuation for Selene, Michael returns to the castle where he was kept prisoner after being kidnapped by Selene, and eventually is captured by Lucian, wherein his resident geneticist ""Singe"" begins experimenting to complete the matamorphosis into the Vampire-Werewolf synthesis.

Viktor wages elegantly with the furious amalgamated warrior, and in an unexpected twist, Selene goes sword to sword with Viktor, ending with a most interesting strike.

The film is repleat with enjoyable dark environments, leather-clad accoutrement, impressive transmogrifications, an original and compelling plot, with constant action-adventure {not horror}, in a general ""Buffy""/VanHelsing-like vain, although the premise is superior to those presentations. Feral monsters versus regal creatures, preserving the story within the shadows, devoid of any pretentiously daylighty ""heroic"" characters, which is appreciated.",1161129600,,2374,5.420054200542006

1947367,4,B0000UI2NM,"Underworld is the story of the war between the Vampires and the Lycans (werewolves); a war that has been raging for over a thousand years. One of the great things about Underworld is that it takes  Vampire and Werewolf lore and fleshes it out, avoiding tired cliches, leaving us with a very fresh story.

One could call this movie an action movie, but even though there is quite a bit of good action, it is at its heart a great story. There are unexpected twists and turns, and the writers go out of their way to avoid many of the pitfalls of using tired Hollywood cliches. For example, there is an attraction between a Vampire character and a Werewolf, but it never deteriorates into cheesiness. We are left wondering what happens after the movie ends as opposed to being tortured with loves scenes that would have been out of place in a flick such as this.

Those who don't have much of a taste for action movies and monsters might hate Underworld, and those who think Anne Rice's universe is the only one that matters might hate it as well (because it breaks tired vampire cliches), but those looking for a fresh monster story will love it. If you liked Van Helsing, this movie is right up your alley.

Understand that Underworld is not perfect, but it entertains. The story does drag at times when the action sequences seem to go on forever. The fight scenes start to blur into one big fight. But I was left wanting more. The worldbuilding was great. Anytime I walk away from a movie wanting to know more about the world, I give kudos to the writers. Underworld did this for me.

A side note: some compare this to the Matrix? Other than a few minor fight scenes where the action flipping is similiar, this comparison is unfounded and unfair to both films. Underworld never comes off as trying to be Matrix-y. It is a modern action trend to have Matrix-like fighting scenes, but a good thing about Underworld is that they did not turn every fight scene into a fight scene from the Matrix. The use of modern fight cliches was limited.

Underworld is worth seeing, and those who love it and get it will really love it. Those who want cliches or the Matrix part 4 will hate it.

The filming is very attractive. Everything is dark, yet not so dark you can't see what's going on. The movie has a gothic look to it - from the sets, to the costumes, to the lighting. (Please don't mistake the meaning of gothic in terms of entertainment as the same thing as the gothic lifestyle.) The music, mostly heavy rock, fits in well with the movie. And the action sequences are expertly shot and exciting to watch. The movie uses several techniques made popular by ""The Matrix"", but who cares? It works perfectly within this movie.

The only downfall of the movie is the complete lack of humor...there's not a single joke in the entire thing! Everything is so serious and dark that unless you're in a pretty good mood the movie could really bring you down...that's how heavy it is.

As for the set. The added scenes provide more insight, and the special features are a treat, especially the 45-minute documentary ""Fang vs. Fiction"", which talks about vampires and werewolves. It was very intriguing.

If you're a fan of this movie and you own the DVD already, I would recommend selling it and buying this version, it's worth the money.",1150502400,4,1418,4.705645161290323

Don't people know that this is an attempt to get away from the crucifixes, turning in to bats and other camp vampire traits?

Don't people realise that, after a 1000 years of fighting one another, the whole sword thing get's a little rusty? Why not use silver nitrate bullets for your average werewolf, I would!

And to those saying that lycan means wolf - uh, hello? It means someone who has the ability to transform in to a wolf - thus, werewolf! It's called lycanthropy - thus, lycan!

Anyway - as for the movie, a brilliant combination of storyline, not too much special effects, and a brilliant set layout. By the end of the movie, you have the real sensation that if you go and find yourself a nice sewer system on a rainy night, you better be  packin something heavier then your keys.

I liked the way that it didn't overdo any of the traditional aspects, and gave a new look in to the history of the two traditional 'creatures of the night'.

It was very well acted and the action sequences were terrific.  There were no ""impossible"" last minute saves or other unbelievable situations.  Everything was built up perfectly and the movie got better and better as it went along.  There were some intriguing plot twists and it was suspenseful just trying to figure out who the real bad guys were and who the good guys were.

Very solid!!! VERY SOLID!

Of course Kate Beckinsale is a fabulous babe and her performance would have been awesome even if she wasn't hot....but what the heck, she IS hot and that just makes it all the better.  The casting for this movie was just about 100% which makes a huge difference in the quality of a film.  If the wrong actors play the wrong roles...the movie is screwed before it even starts.

The vampires think they have almost won the war completely.  Things have been going their way ever since they eliminated the lycan leader Lucien.  But a vampire Deathdealer (Kate Beckinsdale) discovers there may be more lycans than they thought and they may be better organized.  To make it worse, the lycans have also managed to get a hold of some nasty weaponry that is deadly to the vampires.  But none of the other vampires seems to believe the threat that Kate knows is out there so she disobeys orders and investigates on her own.

She learns that the lycans were following a human for some reason.  Kate tries to figure out why and along the way she develops feelings for the human.  Things really heat up when one of the vampire elders is awakened and has to deal with the changing situations.  Plot and counter-plot abound and we learn more of the history of the two races and their feud.  In the end the whole movie seems more like the first part of a much larger story.  I have not yet seen the sequel so I don't know how well it continues the story.

The effects for the movie were pretty good although there are few clear shots of the lycans.  Most of the film almost feels black and white as there is very little color.  There are also many references to the histories and the war and it seems like the numbers get a little confused.  But this is an action-thriller and details like that often suffer so one expects it.  The only real problem I had with the film was the way it felt like it was setting up a larger story.  With the success of the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings movies one can certainly believe that such an attempt could be possible.  We shall see.  One thing I really liked was they way the two societies were portrayed.  While equally intelligent the vampires acted like aristocrats while the werewolves were far more bestial.

I won't give away any of the plot here but there are several twists and it can be a little confusing on the first viewing. But stick with it and watch it a second time if you must. It's worth the effort. While it's an action film at its heart, there is enough thought put into this to be intelligent.

1947386,3,B0000UI2NM,"This is a 2 person review... the reactions of 2 viewers, #1 and #2.

#1 -  Look, this movie was exciting.  You end up wanting to know more about this world, how these vampires and lycons interact with ""normal"" folk like me, and certainly, what happens AFTER the events in this movie.  The action is great, the acting is not too shabby (look tired and thin, but ready for action), and the sets really are interesting, even with the hanging chains and dripping ceilings.  But why are the werewolves called lycon?

#2 -  OK, so you don't know where ""lycon"" came from.  According to Wikipedia, ""Lycon can refer to one of two persons.  First, in Greek mythology, Lycon was a son of King Hippocoon of Sparta... Second, a fellow by the name of Lycon was involved in the trial of Socrates, and acted as one of the three prosecuters.""  Where they got attached to werewolves I don't know. Perhaps from Lycon pictus, the African wild hunting dog?  Is lykos Greek for ""wolf""?

#1 - You're insane.

#2 - Hey, I would have used the term werewolf.  Now what about this movie?

#1 - It is definitely worth seeing if you like sci-fi action.  I don't know what all the chains hanging from the ceilings were for... mood, I guess.  This is the 4th time I've watched this film, and it gets better each time.  You pick up something new each time you watch it.

#2 - Appropriate age range and rating... PG-13?

#1 - No, I'd say it is a R-rated movie, for all the violence.

#2 - The ending makes me interested in seeing the sequel, Underworld Evolution.

#1 - I agree, but I think it is a 4 star movie.

#2 - Tough, I'm the one typing.

#1 - You're lucky it's not a full moon...

#2 - So why did you give it 4 stars?

Selene is a vampire. For centuries she, and her group, the deathdealers, have been riding the world from lycons, werewolves. The war has been raging since God knows when. Now, nobody can even remember when the war began or what caused it. But everyone has the same intentions: kill the other group. For years, lycons have been growing scarce, which means that the vampires are winning. But now, the lycons are resurfacing to track an unknown human. Michael Corvin, a hospital worker, is apparently their target--but not for food. From this storyline we can get a sense that both groups want to find out more about him. Along the way there are many cool stunts, excelent history, and even a connection to science. Each person bitten, the curse of either the vampire or the werewold would get passed on like a virus. But what if a human was bitten by a werewolf . . .and a vampire? What would happen then? Find out here.

Filled with excitement, unraveling storyline, comic-bookish characters and scenes and unbelievable make-up work.

It's been over a year since I saw the original DVD release, but having just caught it on TV last night, I can see why original reviews were less than spectacular. I didn't even really care for it all that much the first time I saw it. It was long on style, but very uneven in storyline. It felt rushed and choppy. And then when a sequel was mentioned, I couldn't figure out why anyone would bother.

Thank god for director's cuts.

It reminded me of when Peter Jackson released his extended cuts of the Rings movies. What had previously been just good movies, became GREAT movies, and all because of just a few minutes here and a few minutes there of extra footage. It completely changed the flow of the film;fleshed it out and made it more complete.

This is what has happened with Underworld-the inclusion of extra footage and deleted scenes into the original movie has completely changed it. Not only does it look great, but it made the story great. The characters have a history that is understandable and interestingly written. It was a real movie instead of just a stylish goth fantasy. I'm hopeful about the sequel.

If you're an extras junkie like me, you like the supplemental disc stuff. They film the techincal bits in a way that's actually interesting to watch, which can be a challenge. The Fang vs. Fiction special is a hoot to watch. People can be so serious about vampires!

  Underworld has some nice fight scenes and made full use of special effects for its time. The story is well thought out. Although so much of the world has to be explained as well it is amazing the story is as well done as it is. And in my opinion the acting worked well for the overall movie.

  The director added in a lot of sound effects that give the sequences more emotion. The moody music and loud sounds help gluing you to the screen.

Since I didn't own the original edition, this was fine for me, but those who already have it, and aren't really interested in any of the specific bonus features (commentary, featurettes on story, stunts, costumes, design, etc.) should keep this in mind.

Underworld is highly stylized creature fetish romp. Dracula vs. the Wolfman, and their bast--er--hybrid son come home to roost. And in that sense, it works well. Kate Beckinsale does good work, decked out in black leather and steel mini-gun, and fits beautifully into the deliberately desaturated, color-corrected world.

An effort is made to provide scientific origins for the supernatural, something also done in the recent Blade franchise, and to do more practical stunts than the CGI-Fu that has so recently come to dominate the filmscape. It doesn't always hold together, nor service the story, but the strength of the overall vision is enough to hold interest.",1138752000,2,1050,5.281437125748503

Kate Beckinsale plays Selene, Sophia Myles plays Erica very well, and she can also be seen in the new movie Tristan and Isolde.

Needless to say, I think Underworld is the most unique vampire movie since Innocent Blood, and the extended version of the movie on DVD is chock-full of extras.  So, if you liked the movie, you'll love the DVD.  If you haven't seen the movie, like vampire movies in general, and want to see the beginning, before you go see Underworld Evolution, please check out the extended cut of Underworld.

1947403,3,B0000UI2NM,"Ah, what can you say about 'Underworld'? Most notably, it needs more action.  The biggest action scene is at the very beginning, and then we've gotta whole lot of plot for a very long time.  The action scenes are, of course, your standard John Woo knockoff, particularly this opening one.  This isn't really a criticism on my part-- If you're gonna knock of a particular action director, Woo is the way to go.  It's also hurt by the fact that the opening action scene is by far the best one in the film.  Ya gotta pace yourself, Underworld!  Still, their just isn't enough killing.  The story elements are amusing in their way, but the balance is way off.

Almost equally important, 'Underworld' could really use a sense of humor.  This movie is so silly and yet it takes itself completely seriously which makes it all the more ridiculous.  If it had a bit of intentional, perhaps self-parodic humor I think I could take the whole thing quite a bit more straight-facedly.

The best thing about `Underwold' is the way it looks.  The thing only cost like 23 million, and it looks completely gorgeous and totally creates the alternate, neo-gothic world that is 'Underworld'.  This film is a classic indictment of the excessive use of CGI in Hollywood, particularly for sets-- Not only does this film cost a fraction of what something like 'Revenge of the Sith' costs, it also looks WAY better.  It actually looks *real*, cause it mostly is.  It has some CGI stuff, but it holds well to my personal rule that you should always use practical, real world effects when they can do the job.  The werewolves themselves don't look so hot, but they're the only really disappointment, and the whole thing is really quite stunning considering the cost.  It's an intensely blue colored affair, but it fits the film and feels appropriate, so that's fine.  Another minor visual concern is that the film fails to differentiate between the visual nature of the vampires and the werewolves sufficiently.  More specifically, the human form werewolves lack any real particular style; they just kinda wear ratty old coats, for the most part.  The vampires are, of course, your Blade/Matrix style black leather neo-gothic night club vampires, the variant which has become utterly dominant in modern vampire cinema.  It disturbs me to think that there are probably a lot of people my age and younger who just think that this is the way vampires are, period.  Not that I particularly care for classically styled vampires or anything, I just fear they lack any perspective.  Anyway...

Performances tend to be wildly over the top, as is de rigeur for modern vampire films.  Bill Nighy is especially fun as the head vampire.  Everyone is pretty hammy, but he really takes it to another level.  Kate Beckinsale is fairly bland, formless protagonist, but, on the other hand, she does spend most of the film in a leather body suit. (This fact which I believe has been mentioned in every review of 'Underworld' yet written, so far be it for me to break tradition.)  I should note that the music is generally overwrought and often irritating.  They used that glass harp or maybe just distant, squealing string sound like a trillion times here and it really gets on my nerves.

I found the plot to be vaguely incomprehensible for most of the film, but it all came together eventually, so perhaps this was intentional.  Frankly, I wasn't terribly concerned with the plot.  This is a film you mostly just stare at, impressed half the time, snickering the other half.  The former impression is superior, obviously, but they both work, so it's not a total loss.

1947404,5,B0000UI2NM,"Vampires have been waging a war against Werewolves for over a thousand years. This movie involves a part of the war that takes place in the 21st century streets of Budapest.

The movie builds the world of vampires and werewolves very well. It shows both the ""beast"" and the human sides of these creatures (the thing that makes it most fascinating I think), so that one can relate to them more as ""real"" characters. It is quite nice how the movie shows some science behind vampire and werewolves; a far stretch but still a good try.

This movie is hard-paced so there is never a dull moment. It is one of those movies that really engages you and allows you into its world. It could very well become a classic.",1138233600,,708,4.438461538461539
1947405,1,B0000UI2NM,"The ""Underworld"" franchise exists for one reason: to punch you in the face. It accomplishes this with its cold visuals and gratuitous violence and nudity. So you sit in the theater, constantly under the attack of explosions and gross-out shots and your attention is consequently held. But there is nothing in either of these films that you will remember by the time you get home. Never have I witnessed such forgettable atrocities. Behind the blood, the vampires, the werewolves, the underwhelming origin story, and of course behind the leather is nothing. These films are as soulless as the vampires they are about.

The lack of sentiment inspired by the ""love"" story is utterly inexcusable. The first movie explored the idea of a love story between Selene and the hybrid Michael. And just when I thought we were in for an interesting twist, they dropped it and didn't mention it again for the rest of the damn movie. Well, in the second installment it goes further, and fast. Before you know it there they are having sex as if that was the logical next step. I don't know about the rest of the audience, but I could have used some freakin development. And they certainly had time if not in the first film they couldve stretched it over the second. And you know what? When Michael took a fatal pole through the chest I didn't care! I felt nothing for Michael, or Selene, or the whole stupid vampire community. I'll tell you what did make me feel something: when he came back to life. Give me a break! He should've stayed dead. Or Selene should start referring to him as The One...(needless to say there were more Matrix parallels than anyone conscious for the last seven years would be happy sitting through).

Well let me end this rant by telling fans of Underworld to rejoice, because it is explicitly clear that yet another sequel is on the way. The final monologue by Selene was so transparent that it may as well have been someone from the studio saying ""in summer 2007, in a theater near you..."" Unfortunately only one example of the shoddy, shoddy writing. So, if you're in the mood for a mindless slasher, go for it.",1138233600,,2125,4.63395225464191
1947406,5,B0000UI2NM,"Selene is a vampire Death Dealer, one who lives to hunt and kill Lycans. She seeks revenge on all Lycans because she is told by Viktor, her dark father, that Lycans killed her family. She enjoys her job until she meets Michael, a human recently turned into a Lycan. Selene is torn between her coven and her feelings for Michael.

Michael is a human hunted by the Lycans for his unique DNA. When he is bitten by a Lycan, he is pulled into the middle of a centuries old war of Vampires against Lycans.

The war between the Vampires and the Lycans has raged for centuries, but the Vampires think that most of the Lycans are dead after their leader, Lucian, is killed. Selene uncovers a possible betrayal of the coven when she discovers that Lucian is very much alive. This sets off a series of events leading to the revelation that the war was not started the way Selene was told it was started. Lies, betrayal and forbidden love all come to an explosive finale.

I really enjoyed this movie because I thought the story was good, creating an intriguing myth for the relationship between Vampires and Lycans. Underworld moved along at a fast pace, keeping the viewer interested. At first, the good guys and the bad guys seem clear until the end when the truth is revealed. The look and feel of the movie was dark and gloomy, which fit perfectly with the story. Well-developed characters dominate the screen, breathing life into ancient mythic creatures. I especially liked Selene with her dour attitude and how she stood up to the controlling Kraven. You go girl! What I also liked about her character is that her hair was messed from the rain and all the fighting she was doing, which is realistic. She still looked hot. I hate when female warriors have hair that does not move or get messed up after fighting. I would have loved to see more romance develop between Selene and Michael. Hopefully this will happen in the sequel. I highly recommend this movie to fans of dark fantasy and vampire and werewolf lore.",1138147200,,2009,4.5905292479108635
1947407,3,B0000UI2NM,"I suppose the one-line review of Kate Beckinsale's pseudo-horror star vehicle, ""Underworld,"" would be, ""If you're going to see one movie this year about vampires fighting werewolves in a gothic metropolis, make it this one.""  Which could reasonably be interpreted as damning with faint praise.

Len Wiseman's first directorial effort results in a visually polished, darkly handsome film.  Set in the present day in an anoymous gothic city, peopled with beautiful-yet-dangerous creatures of the night who live in fantastic mansions and drive hot Europena cars, ""Underworld"" offers plenty of visual thrills.  The aforementioned Beckinsale, clad in a uniform of black leather that makes Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman suit look bulky, stalks the night as Selene, the top Death Dealer for the vampires.  What does it say about the 2001 monstrosity ""Pearl Harbor"" that Beckinsale gives a more convincing performance as a vampire than she did as a WWII nurse?

Using a host of flashbacks, examinations of powerfully-illustrated history texts, and voice-over exposition, the film tells us that the vampires have been at war with the werewolves, or ""Lycans,"" for centuries.  Apparently, the lycans used to be the vampires' servants, but then got uppity.  There's also a smidgen of a ""Romeo and Juliet"" romance that played a role, but that's not the focus of this story.  While the war is sometimes fought with fangs and claws, it's also fought with guns and high-tech ammunition.  They stop fighting long enough to mutter ominous portents about ""returns,"" and ""prophecies,"" and ""the war.""  Nobody is having much fun being a vampire or a werewolf.

And that ultimately is what ""Underworld"" boils down to - not that much fun.  It looks great, but despite the special effects (which are very convincing), there's just not that much point to it all.  Allegedly, Selene has a ""romance"" with a human, Michael (Scott Speedman), who is fated to play an important role in the war.  And there's also Viktor, a ""hibernating"" elder vampire who gets brought back to life by Selene ""a century ahead of schedule.""  There are a few delicious moments as god-of-camp Bill Nighy (""Love Actually"") sinks his teeth into the Viktor role, but there could have been so much more here.

While ostensibly a movie in the ""horror"" genre, it's really more of an action film.  There are no moments of genuine terror, and most of the potentially scary moments dissolve into hastily-cut action scenes.  This isn't a criticism, just an observation about a movie that was hyped (at least to me) as a horror film.

There's a bit much going on with the names in ""Underworld.""  When a sleazy vampire is named ""Craven,"" you're crossing the line from ""showing"" to ""telling.""

You do have to give the filmmakers credit for cojones, however.  The movie is an obvious set-up to a series, and it takes some serious confidence if you believe that you are guaranteed a series of big-budget films based on this visually-splendid trifle.",1138147200,2,2980,5.049079754601227

 The weaving of Nighy's and Beckinsale's history into the film grants a humanity that extends the scope of acceptance to viewers who are not intimately familiar or even remotely interested in Vampire or Werewolf lore. As well extending the plot beyond the baseless erradication of one ""species"" by the other to the bloodline experiment that results in the creation of a ""new"" creature is genius.

 Provided that the writing of the sequel is of equal calibre I will be camping outside my local AMC or EDWARDS CINEMA; unless I have to work.

 I own this movie because the writing and acting were phenomenal. Though I grant that supernatural beings can combat each other without the aid of pistols and sub-machine guns; is it too far a stretch that these characters take advantage of technoligical advance to wage war. That assertion is as absurd as aking that The current Iran Invasion be fought in trenches as in the second world war. Is it also too taxing on the imagination that over centuries a werewolf be able to master the change, as to not be affected by the moon and to change at whim, it detracts little from their cause as these werewolves are very much embracing their state. (a characteristic less oft displayed of those bitten.)

Let's be serious, these are ficticious creatures to begin with, the reasoning of which is left to the writer to invent. To discredit the movie because the Vampires elect not morph into mist, or bat is childish. write your own movie and the creature can behave in a manner befitting of your expectation.

The greatest injustice is the fact that the disc is bright RED, exactly the opposite of everything to do with the movie.

The sequel holds much promise actually. All of the key characters are back played by the same actors...with the same director. That's the first ingredient to a successful sequel (looks like kind of a prequel too).

Underworld: Evolution apparently continues the story of the war between the Death Dealing Vampires and The Howling, and also traces the beginnings of the fight between the two mythical, legendary monsters. But that'll have to be another review entirely.

1947420,4,B0000UI2NM,"I watched ""Underworld"" at the cinema quite a long time ago, despite the fact that the critics had dissed it. I think that critics have a tendency to believe that every movie should give food for thought, whereas I believe that some films that only offer good entertainment should be given a chance, too. At that time, and after some gruelling exams, I was in the mood for some uncomplicated fun, and ""Underworld"" gave me just that.

I hadn't heard from the director, Len Wiseman, but I must say he did an excellent job with this dark action film that features vampires and werewolves (lycans) fighting a 1000 year war against each other and amid the humans. The story is entertaining and original, something that you will appreciate even more if you have the chance of watching this dvd with the extended cut.

One of the main characters in ""Underworld"" is Selene (Kate Beckinsale), a vampire and a Deathdealer (that is, someone who hunts and kills lycans). Selene discovers some lycans hunting a mortal, Michael (Scott Speedman), and gets curious. Why are them after him? Of course, everything the lycans want, Selene will have, so she decides to find Michael. By choosing to do so, she will discover a vast conspiracy, the truth about her past, and a forbidden love.

If you are fond of unconventional action movies, and don't think they need to be realistic, you are likely to love this movie. If that is the case, try to watch it soon, because the sequel will be released on January 20, and from what I could see in the trailer, ""Underworld: evolution"" will be great. So, don't wait, GO and buy or rent it now :)

1947423,4,B0000UI2NM,"One, I enjoyed the movie.  Gun battles, great special effects, and the lovely Kate Beckinsale.  I liked how the movie makers tried to keep humans in all the scenes and didn't use computer graphics for everything.  Being a fan of Whitewolf I enjoyed parts of the movie and can understand why they sued Sony.
But I think they failed in some parts - I would have liked to see vampires fighting fang and claw against the weres a couple of times.  Also, Kate's beauty was under used - she only wore two outfits during the whole movie.  While Sophia Myles, who was Erika, got to show off her beauty with multi-outfits and even got to show off her pretty fangs while on a ceiling.
We never learned much about the history of either sides, only in where it was needed to support the plot.  Frankly, while I like Goth, and found many of the backgrounds interesting, I think some vampires would be more colorful.  You're dead - you might as well enjoy it.  What about body art, nose rings and clown outfits?  And why are weres always in sewers or run-down ruins?  They seem to live just as long - don't they have bank accounts?

Great entertainment value! Very sleek stylized action with a very beautiful female lead. Kate Beckinsale definitely enters the role of Selene like a perfect fit.

Unlike some of the other reviews here, I cannot tell you, the reader, the difference between the Unrated and the original Rated version. Watching the Unrated version was my FIRST time watching this film. I have to admit, the film seemed to have a relatively solid plot. The story worked for this kind of movie.

I enjoyed this DVD immensely. I bought it on sale for 15.97. And for that price, I would be hard-pressed to find another deal better than that...unless you were to purchase a used version.

It's got a good solid premise, a war between supernaturals, which could be far more interesting than most movies where one supernatural wins out, but it never goes anywhere with it.

The script, the plot, etc...are all pretty boring and mediocre. The action is also disappointing , as you almost never see vampires and werewolves sparring with their powers, just using guns like regular henchmen.

I give it two stars out of generosity.

One for visual style--it's got a nicely dark, moody and gothic atmosphere and sets, good for setting mood.

And one for kate beckinsale in leather--always a nice addition.",1134172800,,724,4.901639344262295
1947427,4,B0000UI2NM,"Directed by Len Wiseman, starring Kate Beckinsdale and Scott Speedman and largely filmed in Budapest, ""Underworld"" hit the big screen in 2003. It's a very stylish `monster' movie, though - a little unusually - humans are neither the heroes nor the victims. (The film doesn't stop for 'lunch').

Beckinsdale plays Selene, our 'heroine' and the 'good' vampire. She's a Death Dealer - a vampire soldier - in a war against werewolves that has lasted for around a thousand years. As time has passed, the weapons used by both races have been updated - there are no stakes or crossbows in sight, while the traditional silver bullet has been modified. The current battles are being waged with throwing stars, guns and grenades - all enhanced to target the specific weaknesses of the intended victim. However, tradition hasn't been entirely sacrificed - vampires are still stylish and pale, while the vampire clan still lives in an old-fashioned, classy mansion. (Like the weapons, however, it does incorporate some 'modern' aspects). Selene very much looks to Viktor for guidance - Viktor is one of the vampires' three elders and something of a father figure to Selene. However, as the film opens, he is in hibernation and the day-to-day running of the vampires' affairs are in Kraven's hands. Kraven, somewhat power-hungry, also has designs on Selene - however, she ins't even remotely interested - she regularly disobeys his instructions and doesn't believe a great deal of what he has to say.

Werewolves have officially been on the defensive for around 600 years, since Kraven killed their greatest leader, Lucien. However, they have never been fully defeated and, from early in the film, it seems the vampires have been lulled into a false sense of security. As well as the updated weapons, werewolves - or lycans, as they're known throughout the film - can now transform at will and no longer have to wait on the full moon. They appear to be in full control of their actions and can also heal more quickly while in wolf form. Where the vampires are pale and stylish, the werewolves are more animal-like and live underground. However, this hasn't stopped them performing 'medical research', with a particular interest in a family called Corvin. As the film opens, a couple of werewolves are stalking Speedman's character, a doctor called Michael Corvin. Selene, who's been on patrol and sees what's happening, is puzzled by this - it's clear the werewolves aren't just hunting for food. Her interest develops much further as the film progresses to the point of romance. This brings her a great deal of trouble when it becomes apparent the werewolves have 'turned' Michael. (It's also brought the comparisons with 'Romeo and Juliet' - a romance between two warring houses). As a result of the romance, she learns a great deal more about the origins of war and the night she was sired by Viktor.

This is a very enjoyable and stylish film, with some very impressive special effects. Although technically, I suppose, it's a 'supernatural' movie, there's a strong thriller element to it, with plenty of gunfights, political intruige, treachery, twists and turns...and if that's not enough, it's also got Kate Beckinsdale !! Absolutely recommended for those who love vampire movies. However, despite the comparisons with 'Romeo and Juliet', I can't really see it convincing your Shakespeare-loving aunt to start watching the Hammer films.",1132531200,,3430,5.056537102473499

1947430,4,B0000UI2NM,"I just saw this movie, rented it over this weekend. Although there might be some slight inconsistencies (I think they squeazed two nights into one long night without pause) the pacing of the story keeps you from worrying about it. The movie takes a more secular or mundane route for explaining the existence of vampires and werewolves. For not being a big budget movie, they did well with what they had. It is a bit bloody, but considering the subject matter it is rather tame, and is handled more cinematically, than graphically.

As for the question of what a vampire/werewolf would look like, I think you have to consider he was not in werewolf form when he was bitten and he was given enzymes to keep him from transforming to a werewolf, hence, the form would not be very wolf like until the individual in question could have the enzymes take their course. Remember, that character had never fully transformed into a wolf form, therefore, his structure would not be fully changed.

All in all I thought it was a well done movie, and you would never know that it was made with a fraction of the money spent on the Matrix's second movie! I've heard the ""extended cut"" is even better.",1131408000,,1185,4.584905660377358
1947431,5,B0000UI2NM,"""Underworld"" takes two staples of horror - the vampire and the werewolf - and matches them against each other in an action-movieesque power struggle, with a strong romantic element at its heart.  I'll admit that from the trailers I didn't know if this would work - the love angle sounded fine, but I thought if you're going to have a vampires vs. werewolves war, why give them so much heavy firepower that it's going to change it from a horror movie into a straight-out action movie?  Fortunately, those fears were unfounded.  While the firepower and the swords do allow ""Underworld"" to function as a first-rate action film, they do not, in my opinion, hold the movie back from being a whale of a horror movie as well.  Of all the martial arts/swirling swords/blazing guns and black leather horror out there that have formed their own little genre (""Blade"" trilogy, ""The Crow"" movies, etc.), this and the ""Resident Evil"" movies sit atop the mountain.  ""Underworld"" far surpassed any expectations I had for it.

  A centuries-old war between vampires and werewolves (known as Lycans in the ""Underworld"" mythos) forms the scenario and the launching point, with the vampires currently in the winning position but with new developments in the wings for both clans that may shift the balance.  The lead vampire is Selene (the gorgeous and perfectly attired Kate Beckinsale), a ruthlessly efficient 'Death Dealer' (vampire assasin) out to avenge the deaths of her previous (human) family at the hands of rogue Lycans, and she's brought into contact with a mortal named Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) who may be the key to creating a perfect vampire/werewolf hybrid that would be more powerful or dangerous than either species.  The romantic story that slowly builds is never forthright but obvious nonetheless; it's 'felt' far more than 'seen' through the movie.  A labyrinth of power alliances and ancient secrets sets the balance of the war - and several of the cast of characters's places within it - spinning.

  The pantheons of werewolves and vampires remain credible horror creatures, their use of modern weaponry and martial arts fighting techniques (the latter mostly just for the vampires) serving not only to make the show more appealing for action fans but to differentiate the characters from those in previous great vampire and/or werewolf movies (""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", the ""Ginger Snaps"" movies, the Hammer movies, ""Dracula's Curse"", etc.)  And ""Underworld"" and ""Blade"" and such are actually helping the whole genre by Not retreading the ground that's been done so effectively before (although occsionally a werewolf or vampire movie like the just-mentioned ""Dracula's Curse"" will come along and work the traditional territory and still be fresh and awesome) but by forging out new screen territory for these classic creatures to operate in.  Fellow horror fans will be happy to know that the action isn't confined to machine guns and swords - the Lycans are lethally effective in the fang-and-claw department, and both sides make use of more olden weapons (whips, cudgels, etc.), sometimes modified a bit for the creature's attributes.  I.E. a Lycan can wield a far bigger and heavier cudgel or mace far more effectively than even the strongest human ever could.  I'd like to see these weapons get more screentime in the sequel(s), just as I think it might not be a bad idea to take another classic race of monsters (maybe gargoyles or goblins?) and put a new spin on them.  To keep going and be just as great as the first one they're going to have to add in some new characters beyond Selene et al., and there's no reason not to go beyond the established races of vampire, werewolf, and human.

  Great characterization, impressive performances all around and high production values help ""Underworld"" live up to its full potential.  Horror fans, action fans (especially those inclined towards great, larger-than-life martial arts action), fantasy fans who don't mind their fiction dark and violent, and any fans of rip-roaring adventurous movies where the love angle isn't just a cool subplot but an essential focus, have Got to see this one, and especially to see this extended version.  Outstanding on all counts.",1131235200,2,4230,5.061959654178675
1947432,4,B0000UI2NM,"The ""Underworld"" sequel will soon be out so now is a good time to revisit the original.  Personally I enjoyed this film more than any high budget ""mainstream movie"" I have seen in years. But I can see many of the problems others have pointed out. Although the small action scenes work very well, the more elaborate scenes are disjointed, confused, and somewhat silly. If you compare the opening subway sequence to the train station sequence in ""The Untouchables"", you see an illustration of why less is better; and ""Underworld"" expends more ammo for less effect than anything this side of a ""Godzilla"" film.

Along with too much aggressive confusion is the silliest head-splitting in cinema history. Similar to the way Tarentino dispatched Lucy Lie in ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" (i.e. a delay in the actual detachment-I don't know which film did it first but Tarentine did it way better), the effects editor overlooked the need to show a slice in the head before it topples off. Surely this was just simple incompetence and not deliberate, because there are ways to show this (i.e. a line) that would still make it a relatively shocking scene.

The story itself breaks too many horror genre conventions and fails to generate much real suspense (although the climax is somewhat surprising). But ultimately these problems did not interfere with my enjoyment of the movie.

This was because it is first and foremost a Kate Beckensale's vehicle, as emphasized by recent trailer for the sequel. It is likely that your feeling about the film will depend on your impression of Beckensale. She has never looked better and I'm just talking about her face which I could watch in closeup for two hours without the slightest complaint.  She is increasingly an absolute ringer for a 1940-ish Loretta Young. An earlier comment noted that: ""This 30 year old has the figure and face of a magazine model, with the bored flat expression to match. Pour this tight little body into a reflective rubber suit and you have something to anchor your movie"". All this is very true but add intelligence, subtlety and nuance not seen since Diana Rigg was playing Mrs. Peel. The film does not demonstrate her range (you have to watch ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" for the best evidence of that) but it is one of those rare cases where you can't imagine anyone but her in the role.

The production design, lighting, and cinematography are all excellent and the DVD has some great features explaining these aspects of the production.

The film has a nice consistent look that fits very well with the story.  I don't understand the comments that are negative overall, or what films these people are unfavorably comparing it to-can't be the garbage films that have been coming to mainstream theaters over the past few years. Bottom line, if you like the genre, appreciate stylish production design, and think highly of Ms. Beckensale you should make it a point to see this movie.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1130803200,3,2990,4.810916179337232
1947433,3,B0000UI2NM,"Tight leather outfits, gothic look, lots of automatic weapons and just enough vampire lore to make it all fit.  Good stuff.  Not overly gory.  Really quite tame.  The werewolves are a bit scary.  Not for the young.",1130716800,,214,4.675675675675675
1947434,3,B0000UI2NM,"I'm not going to be too hard on this film because it really isn't that bad.  It's just not very good, either.  I'll start with the negative.

This movie has Kate Beckinsdale in it.  Kate Beckinsdale is HOT.  I sat through Serendipity just because she was in it.  I enjoyed Van Helsing even more than I would've because Kate was so beautiful as Queen of the Gypsies.  But in Underworld, Kate looks, well, just not very hot.  She's still beautiful, but the whole pale, bad haircut, bodysuit look just doesn't do anything for her.  So that's a big strike against the film right there.

Onto the positive:  The film has an interesting premise though it doesn't really explore any new ground with it.  These vampires are pretty standard vampires.  Ditto, the werewolves.  But there are some cool action sequences, a nice gothic feel, and solid acting.

Here's the BIG COMPLAINT:  Like so many series books now, this movie doesn't end.  It's just a setup for the next film.  I don't mind a few dangling plot threads, but this movie pretty much stops in the middle of the story.  The ending scene is as ""To be continued . . ."" as if I were watching a TV cliffhanger.

I HATE CLIFFHANGERS!  I cannot stress this enough.  When I pay seven bucks to see a movie, I want a whole movie.  Not just the beginning of the movie.  I want a set up, a conflict, and a resolution.  Without that, any film is just wasting my time.

Overall, an okay film, but one I'd probably never watch again.",1130630400,2,1472,4.43984962406015
1947435,5,B0000UI2NM,"by Brandi Pitts.

A war centuries old rages between the vampires and the lycans (better known as the werewolf). In an attempt to bring the war to a close, a vampire named Kraven and the lycan elder, Lucian, create a hybrid, a cross between the lycan and vampire species.

Underworld has a lot of suspense in it. When the main character, a vampire named Selena, realized her enemies, the werewolves, were after a human, she had no idea as to why. She had to go gather evidence to help her figure out what was going on.

Romance plays a pretty big role in Underworld. Love between the vampire and lycan species was forbidden by vampire laws. The vampires feared a blend of the species. So when Lucian, the werewolf, asked a vampire to marry him, his soon-to-be bride was killed. That's how the war began. Centuries later, Selena finds herself in the same situation when she falls for Michael, the hybrid.

The action scenes in Underworld are stunning. There are many life-or-death situations for the characters. The part with the most action and over all best graphics would be when the hybrid, Michael changes for the first time and fights the vampire, Viktor.

Underworld is a great movie and highly recommended for fans of werewolves and vampires. The creators of the movie did a great job bringing the fictional characters to life. They added a few of their own details but managed to stay true to the overall image of the creatures.",1129939200,,1435,4.678571428571429

""Underworld"" follows Celine (Kate Beckinsdale), a sexy vampire whose in the midst of a war with the Lycans. The goal of both the Lycans and the Vampires, is to exterminate the other side. No one really knows why the war was started, or how long it's been going on, all they really know is the other race is the enemy, and it's their job to get rid of them. However quickly into the movie, you'll discover that there is foul-play going on between Vampire and Lycan leaders, furthering the depth of the plot. Celine's romance with a human, recently turned Lycan does nothing to help the matter. Start to finish I found the movie very interesting, especially the fight scenes and special effects. There's plenty for action and horror fans a like to find in this movie, and that's why it's a recommended must see to any of those people. The Unrated extended cut is the essential version of the movie, as it further develops characters in the movie, and has an extended final fight sequence. The ending is kind of a cliff-hanger, so can we expect an Underworld 2? One can only hope.

All in All there's no reason to not buy the DVD if you liked the movie, especially the Unrated extended cut. If you liked it before, I think you will be more than satisfied with the purchase of this DVD. If you didn't catch it in theatres, then this is a great opportunity to get a great movie. I highly recommmend it to fans of action or horror. Definitely if you're a Resident Evil fan this is worthy of checking out. So don't let your blood run cold, and miss out on this one.",1128902400,,2190,4.365196078431373
1947439,5,B0000UI2NM,"I had already seen the movie in the Theatre, but I felt I wanted to own a copy. When I heard there was an unrated version , or an European version, I decided to purchase it.

What a waist of the extra cost. The unrated version, to me, has practically no differences to the Screen version. There are no extended scenes or scenes that were missing at the movies, at least non that I recognized. Save yourselves the money and buy the regular version.

It is still a very ""Sweet"" movie.",1128643200,,482,4.285714285714286

1947441,5,B0000UI2NM,"I sadly missed this movie when it was out in theatres but had a chance to see it when it hit dvd. I absolutely loved it and just had to get the extended edition, which adds much to the originally wonderful movie.

This vampire/werewolf horror story just oozes with unique twists, spectacular action, awesome environments, and mostly great acting.

Beckinsale, as Selene, looked terrific, acted terrific, and really made the movie what it was. She played her action scenes well and made it look like she was an veteran action heroine.

She played her parts with plenty of eye candy, flair, and grace to spare. A truly awesome performance on her part.

Her love interest, Scott Speedman, was also great and he generated a great deal of believable emotion and reality in his transformation parts and his 'what the f is going on' parts.

Likewise, the main 'bad guy' Lucian was casted and played superbly. The twists with his story and character are what really made this movie much more than your cliched horror film. The fact that this movie had an intricate history and actual plot behind its characters made you side with its actors that much more. I loved Lucian at the start when he was a 'bad guy' and i loved him even more at the end when he became a 'tragic hero' in his own little way. And the ending, with its slow silent face to face shot and fitting background music, really hit the mark. There were so many words spoken and emotions put out in that awesome wordless exchange.

From its great plot that was ever surprising, to its beautiful settings, scenary, and gothic environments, and to the vicious, growling, and awesome looking werewolves, this was a fun movie to watch.

Underworld did not become a sleeper success and best selling dvd for no reason. So if you want your horror movies with a bit more to them than killings and gore than pick up Underworld. You won't be disappointed.",1126915200,2,1900,4.636904761904762
1947442,1,B0000UI2NM,"I was forced to go see this movie when it was first released and I laughed through the whole thing. The acting is terrible and I could,in no way, feel any sympathy for any of the characters. The screenplay is awful and there are huge gaps in the story that are never resolved.

Go see a Hammer Studios vampire flick, such as Taste The Blood Of Dracula. You'll thank me.",1126915200,2,369,4.271428571428571
1947443,4,B0000UI2NM,"I liked the original Underworld but to the degree of it being a 3 1/2 versus this version, which does a much better job at maintaining continuity and fleshing out the storyline so that many questions from the original were answered, and one backstory made the character's intentions much more viable.

I found a lot of silly plot holes in the theatrical version of Underworld and to some degree wonder who directed this film as Len Wiseman borrowed very heavily, particularly from The Matrix franchise. There are others but beyond seeing Neo make a guest appearence, Underworld was tainted by how heavily it followed it's Matrix leanings.

The good news is the increased depth in characters. Intentions are better explained, and not in a super talky way, nor a non-stop video montage, both typical of the gothic horror genre.

While the Romeo and Juliet theme is a bit stronger in this version of the film it was unavoidably obvious from the theatrical version, though there are signs Wiseman is more than adept at cloning genres with the occasional 'art film' dual themes played out over 2 or 3 minutes.

That's one thing about film that people can easily forget. Adding, removing or editing a more concise segment or two can make the film vastly more enjoyable past the bullets and blood.

Kate Beckensdale does a fine job as an action starlet, something punctuated by her work in The Aviator, another stretch from the costumed period pieces she'd been known for. Both films show her to be comfortable in any genre. Underworld does for Beckensdale what Fight Club did for equally well rounded and beautiful Helena Bonham Carter.

Both roles were breakthrough in that they were so out of character as to be potential career blunders. Thankfully for screengoers both actresses aquitted themselves nicely, Beckensdale even more than Bonham Carter, as Carter's role was a scene stealing, tremendous character. Here, Kate Beckensdale is the lead actor and has substantially more screen time to make or break her performance.

The only odd thing about Underworld not fixed were the various British actors sounding like East End thru high society London, the additions of Eastern European laced English coming from figures one might expect to see in a Czeck or Polish film, along with the 2004 style U.S. male actor, Scott Speedman for example, who sounds nearly stupid and inarticulate at times. Having seen him in other films such as the indie, low budget or B film, ""The 24th Day"" - youu choose the adjective, wasn't exactly mainstream though his performance was explosive and so much in character in than Underworld. The film has the gothic, European look with characters that work until you hear SoCal actors subtracting from the mood. In the Director's cut, Speedman's character is given 3 dimensions and the film benefits, but they whole unknown town theme is lost by the hodegpoge of three or four English speaking styles. It still doesn't work, although the new version explains more about Spendman's character, which sheds light on a lot of his behavior in the film.

The new version proves, at least to my satisfaction, that good old filmaking skills are required beyond special effects, be they physical or CGI. The premise needs to be good, the script needs to be acceptable, the actors need to know their craft and the director needs to have a vision. Underworld isn't the first film to have been damaged in the editor's hands. See Blind Horizon - great cast, overworked premise and literally, hijacked film. When the editor is the person doing the film's voice over track you know there's trouble. When the director is a ghost, you know better or worse, the film wasn't his any longer. And finally, when the editor starts discussing the remaking of the film by resequencing segments and changing genre from mystery to action film, you know there are some serious problems. Oh, and when you see some of the deleted scenes and think, ""hmm, this looks like it was better than the film I just watched"" you know something very bad happened.

And while that wasn't the case with the original Underworld versus the new cut, it certainly was missing a lot of important things, like exposition, depth of character and overall, better flow to the film than the original release.

Verdict - Underworld Directors Cut is a better film than the original. It's pace is as quick as before but more gets through, and in this case, more is better. If you sat on the border about this film as I had it might bring you into the fan's camp. Most important, the film loses nothing from it's original release.

As for buying it in a lavish 2 CD box? The first DVD has a good selection of extras, many similar or the same to the original release. DVD 2 has several new and interesting/insightful video that help explain how various areas of the film were made. There is considerable extras from the original release's already generous extras.

If extras motivate you, there's plenty new mateirial to enjoy. If you loved the original, you might be curious and want to at least rent, though some stores don't include extra discs from what I've heard, and the extras are worthwhile. Most of all, if you were like me and felt something was missing from the theatrical release then this is worth a view, and quite possibly, a purchase.

My rating is not quite a five star film, but it's a steady 4, perhaps higher as I watch it more. There is no doubt it is a better film than Underworld and if you haven't purchased the original this is certainly the way to go.

The only question I have is whether they could have featured both cuts as they did in the new Alien series. Those discs are so dense with information you'd have to book a day to get through them, which brings me to my question. Why couldn't the original Underworld cut been available on this release?

Greed, I suspect. Why stop at a measly two editions when there's the Platinum Superbit with 12:1:1 stereo and five different encoders built in so every computer known to mankind can play it back and make some money at the software end as most of these technologies are sold independently at $15 a codec.

Am I jaded? You bet I am. Art is still product and if the CD/DVD companies are good at, and it certainly isn't creativity on the music side, the film side will squeeze the last penny from you given the chance. Still think I'm jaded? How about this...Batman Begins is already being released in one and two DVD collections with close to the same price, but one with extra features. I haven't seen it but it wouldn't surprise me at all if the second disc was unnecessary and only made to differentiate which version had more stuff on it. Still not convinced? How many releases of Aliens were there already before this new crop of re-edited and original?

Be that the case. I'd reccomend this over the feature release version.",1125964800,5,6874,4.734113712374582

I have always had an interest in vampires, gothic subjects, etc.  This movie does a great job of getting into the inner workings of a mythical/created vampire sect (coven) and makes the journey of discovery interesting.  Also, the weapons employed in the movie, the special effects, and the soundtrack are also deserving of mention.  If you like the dark, you'll like Underworld...

All to often lately the move ends with the appearant sequel already ready. This is the case with this movie as well. Although, this movie does close one of the plot lines - but not much more than that.

1947449,3,B0000UI2NM,"When White Wolf Game Systems sued the makers of ""Underworld"" for ripping off their world, with its highly social and politicized vampires who sleep for eons and their violent emnity with werewolves, it was assumed it was because they were trying to cash in on WWGS' World of Darkness.

Yes and no.

""Underworld"" is theoretically about vampires and werewolves, but honestly, it mostly ends up being leather-clad people shooting fancy guns at other leather-clad people. In other words, it devolves into the worst sort of World of Darkness game, with angsty gun-toting idiots killing other angsty gun-toting idiots over something that probably made sense at the beginning of the evening, but eventually just becomes an excuse for posturing and gunplay.

In the DVD extras, one of the creators of the film says ""Underworld"" might be one of the best vampire movies ever made. This might be true if no other vampire movies ever had been made. As it is, it's not the worst ever -- the ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" movie holds onto the left end of the bell curve with a death grip -- but this confused, muddled and ultimately pointless film isn't much better than mediocre, at the end of the day.

Vampire fans are advised to check out ""Near Dark,"" ""Bram Stoker's Dracula,"" ""From Dusk Til Dawn"" or even ""Fright Night"" or ""Lost Boys"" for a better vampire experience.

I was glad that the film didn't over empathise the feelings between Selene and Scott, it would have totally ruined the movie and turned it into a cheap horror/romance flick when it was so much more than that. I do agree that a bit more of the lore of the Werewolf and Vampire link coulfd be explained, but on those occasions when it was delved into it was focusing more on the personal history - adding substance to the plot. But the link was explained, you just have to listen! Besides in the Sequel no doubt more of the past will be explained, hopefully more about Selene and Scott as their own histories are only ever hinted at, never fully explained to us, except maybe Selene but i digress, keping them in mystery. i cant wait for the Sequel as i found this movie fantastic with it's skew on the supernatural, i thoroughly recommend it to anybody who likes films that take a new spin on sometimes cliched ideas.",1121299200,,1166,4.427906976744186

This movie really didn't pay any homage to old Vampire/Werewolf mythology, it didn't really have much action, and the Romeo & Juliet thing is not really expressed and there's only one kiss between the two main people.  Kate Beckinsale is alright as the main Vampire, but Scott Speedman (you may have seen him in Dark Blue, an excellent movie) really doesn't have much to add to the film, and was sort of a waste.  I thought the Vampire Werewolf hypbrid would be kind of cool, but the transformation was alot cooler than the end result which looked like a guy painted gray with sharp teeth and claws, very creative.  The end result of this movie was a boring anticlimactic piece that is something like The Matrix was, starting its own trilogy, which is what I think they're doing.

I was really into the movie up to the part where Celine (Kate Beckinsale) runs in to save Michael (Scott Speedman). At that point the movie adds extra twists which are totally unnecessary and becomes very confusing. Also, the story gets totally lost among the twists and becomes just a movie where two people are uselessly fighting. The character Craven just disappears even though he seemed like a rather important character.

The movie has a neat and cool opening fight and then... Well, the movie's plot started to bore me and there was too much talking. It was a pretty boring movie and I found myself dozing off at times. Also, Kate Beckinsale fires her uzi guns like 5000000000000 times before finally reloading. How many bullets does it hold? And also, she seems to fire a lot but hits mostly the walls. Also, the fights weren't very exhilirating. And it would have been really cool if the vampires would have like jumped off walls to dodge the werewolves but no..

Selene (Kate Beckinsale of Pearl Harbor fame) is a Beautiful Vampire Soldier (Death Dealer) whose purpose is to hunt down and kill any Werewolves she comes across, until one day (or night it is always dark it seems) she comes across a human Micheal who the Lycans are trying to capture. Well of course she falls for this guy and the plot gets more intense as it moves along between betrayal, power struggles and internal conflict which brings the film to an interesting (and bloody of course) end.

The setting is very dark and ""gothic"". It seems like it is always raining and cold looking (which adds to the feeling of this film). Costumes are also the type seen in the usual Gothic Vamp circles. Action scenes are pretty good as well (enter the Matrix).

It was a sleeper hit in October 2003 and it continues to draw crowds of viewers. I saw the normal DVD (rented) and liked it so much I picked up the Extended version (2 DVD set unrated) it adds about 20 min more to the film and comes with some interesting extras. I particularly liked the documentary called Fangs or Fiction which touches on the history of Vampire, Werewolf Myths and Legends and even has an interview with a ""real"" Werewolf as well as two ""real"" Vampires.

Vampire and werewolves and fancy fighting and Matrix-styled clothing, everyone too good looking for reality, and so on. Yeah, just fun stuff.

N e way the sequel Underworl Evolution is coming out later this year its when Marcus becomes half and half and the lycans and vampires become hunted!!!!!,1110067200,,429,4.2439024390243905
1947470,3,B0000UI2NM,"I watched this movie on cable, and when I went to pro.imdb.com to see if it had been released to theaters or was a direct to DVD release, I was surprised to see that it had opened in the theaters with twenty million, made fifty million total in the U.S., and added another forty-five million in DVD/Video rentals! I honestly thought, given what I perceived to be some imperfections, that it may have been a direct to DVD release.

While watching the film I was impressed by the lighting, the cinematography, costumes (although why Selene was often dressed like Catwoman didn't make much sense), artwork - in other words, the things that make a film look good. I was also intrigued by the concept of a vampire/werewolf hybrid.

However, if I hadn't read in the movie guide that this was a film about hybrids, I would have been lost. Vampires and werewolves looked the same to me. Perhaps there was a bulging of teeth that the vampires had that the werewolves didn't - truthfully, I don't remember. What I do remember was Lucian - as a human - biting another human and turning him.

There is an interesting twist in the storyline that I didn't see coming, and so I give praise to the writer(s) for that. However, the story sagged in many places.

This is a story about werewolves and vampires. Why did it look like they were cowboys and Indians, having long drawn out shoot-outs? Vampires and werewolves have extraordinary powers: *use them*! I understand that the vampires were shooting with silver bullets, which are anathema to werewolves and perhaps their best weapon (in that movie) against them, and that the werewolves MAY have been shooting the bullets made of concentrated daylight (neat idea - but it wasn't developed at all), but still: battles between vampires and werewolves would have made for more exciting action. When a werewolf attacked Viktor, and he caught it by its throat, there was real tension. The first real tension I experienced, in fact, regarding the feud between werewolves and vampires. That tension came far too late in the film. During the gunfights, there was no tension. For me, gunfights lost their appeal somewhere after The Lone Ranger.

Also, Selene goes to great risk to save Michael, whom she apparently loves, but aside from the fact that she's hot, and he's hot, I have no idea why they liked each other. Sure, this is a ""monster movie"", but if there's going to be a love interest that is *really* the center of the story (think about it - if Selene didn't have feelings for Michael, there wouldn't have been a story to tell), then we need to know more about it.

All of my complaining aside, I did enjoy the film; especially the intriguing plot twist and the climax. Interestingly, there wasn't much of a d&eacute;nouement - just a climax. I guess the d&eacute;nouement was Selene's voice-over telling us that there would be a sequel although, of course, she didn't use those words. And there will be a sequel.

The hybrid concept was terrific - and the result of that experiment was, for lack of better description, really cool. For that reason alone I'll see the sequel. I just hope it's not another round of cowboys and Indians.",1109808000,2,3173,4.706306306306306

Things get more complicated when a human doctor is caught up in the conflict, as he becomes the means for creating a vampire-werewolf hybrid, something that could tip the balance between the combatants.

Underworld is a highly entertaining, action packed adventure/thriller with significant elements of horror.

Kate Beckinsale (who is GORGEOUS!!!), Bill Nighy, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!

The plot, the setting, the special effects, the MUSIC, and the swordfights are all EXCELLENT!  Underworld is a movie guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!

Kate Beckinsale's character Selene moves in such a way as to guarantee that her full length leather coat will billow and swing perfectly. Her hair dangles in her face in a perfectly planned but seemingly accidental fashion. Her slow motion moves are a carbon copy of those we've seen in other dark and futuristic films, but I didn't care. I wanted to see more.

Michael Sheen-the actor who plays Lucian, the leader of the Werewolves-is perfectly cast. He has an amazing intensity and an elegant speaking voice. Whereas you might expect the leader of a pack of animals to be rough and barbaric, Sheen's Lucian is steady, controlled, and often soft spoken.

This is a very enjoyable film with a fairly original premise. I heard there were plans for a sequel. Sign me up.

1947473,3,B0000UI2NM,"This movie is getting alot of critique here at amazon.  Another one of those fringe films everyone has an opinion on.  Some of the supporters are obvious gothic horror film freeks who like anything with wowzer special affects.  Some of the detracters just can't enjoy a film that isn't ""highly acclaimed"".

  Well, I fall between these two extremes.  Here's my take on this highly watchable ""horror/action/gothic/Matrix"" wanna-be;

-Obviously ""The Matrix"" series (and it's financial success) had allot to do with this getting made.  I would call this the horror equivelent to ""The Matrix"" series.

-Now some are crying fowel. But this film gets criticized for the exact thing that ""The Matrix"" does; THE STORY HAD INFINITE BUT FAILED POTENTIAL.

-Actually, I think if ""The Matrix"" stopped at the first film, it would have been more impressive.  ""Underworld"" has a less flawed story than the 2 ""Matrix"" sequals.

-Say what you will, the special affects are pretty cool.  This is how this film got most peoples attention in the first place.

-Miss Beckinsale is quite fetching in her costume... hey, you can't argue!

-The vampires (other than Kate) seemed a little too whimpy.  For the most part, they get trounced.

-The stories biggest flaw: Using guns to do most of the fighting.  These are supernatural creatures,  LET THEM DUKE IT OUT!!

-I did not know that vampires could act in a consious manner with their brains detached from their bodies.  Just nit-picky I guess.

-I really enjoyed this film on a visual level.  They obviously were going for allot of ""posed"" imagry.

-Most reviewers are correct when they say you don't care much for either side.  HOW COULD YOU!!  THEY ARE, BY DEFINITION, SCARY MONSTERS THAT EAT US!!

-The DVD is adequate for the ""not-the-directors-unrated-cut-super-special-edition"".  For what I paid (NOT $15) I'm happy.

The bottom line:  I actually was very afraid to buy this based on the mixed reviews.  So, I waited for a really good sale.  I'm happy with my purchase.  Not a great film but entertaining.  It will be fun to watch around Halloween.  Given the premise, most people with a fair imagination could have come up with much more dynamic and quality alternative story-line.  But I am much less disturbed by this than the ""matrix"" sequals (which I also enjoyed quite a bit).  If you can't get over that part of it, then I wouldn't recommend it.

 In ways it is satisfactory but in other ways it fails to deliver. The special effects are really good and so are a lot of the action sequences.

 Unfortunately a lot of the movie caters too much to MTV trends and it really tends to water down the greatness of this movie. The acting is decent though.

The story line is an interesting twist of the family feud genre.  The story is compelling enough to hold up under the over-the-top effects.  While the Matrix-style effects are cool, they are becoming generally overdone in Hollywood as a whole.  Just my personal hangup that I'd rather have a little less stop-action/slow motion and more kick-butt in ""real time"" action.

Then there are the usual ""laws of physics"" hangups...a Deathdealer jumps from a tall building but doesn't crack the pavement when she lands.  Granted, she's a vampire and they are already living outside of the laws of nature, but is it too much to ask for a little more reality in the scifi aspects of a film?

I thought the overall effects of the werewolves, or Lycans as they are called in the film, was decent but still not wholly believable in appearance.  It's hard for Hollywood to get the look of a werewolf right, so these guys were actually farily good compared to some.

Overall, the film was a fun ride and I look forward to the next installment.",1107820800,,1168,4.686274509803922

From the music to the dark set.  This movie is awesome!  You get pulled into the movie at the opening when you see Vampires watching the city and then they go in for the hunt because they see Lycans are in the city and following someone.  It starts out with action as they start a whole scene fighting one another.  It is not your typical love story it is more based on Vampires vs. Lycans but you get a sense of love with Kate and Scott.  But it in now way takes away from the action you feel in this movie.  You will not be displeased with this movie it has a lot of cool special effects and the blood going into Viktor  was neat.

However, the biggest problem is that the filmmakers cared more about the look of the film than the story.  Specifically, the only thing this film seems to want to do is imitate The Matrix: they copy the art direction, the wardrobe, the cinematography - there are some shots that are exact duplicates.  Of all the Famous Monsters of Filmland, the werewolf is perhaps the most terrifying, but they keep getting ruined on film.  These wolves are too CGI to be really scary - and why to they need to walk on walls?

However, the movie is not a total train wreck.  There is enough non-stop action to pass a rainy afternoon in front of the TV.  It just could've been better.",1107648000,,795,4.549295774647887
1947478,3,B0000UI2NM,"This turned out to be a fairly entertaining movie.  It takes the classic Hatfields and McCoys story line and substitues vampires and lycans(werewolves) for the two families.  The vampire elders ensure this by forbidding their people to learn any history.  I must say though the weapons that each side use are much more impressive than backwoods shotguns.  Each side has highly engineered weapons that target the others weakness.  The vampires have bullets containing silver nitrate of which the werewolves cannot surive.  Similarly the werewolves have ultraviolet bullets that are lethal to the vampires.

The plot hinges around the revenge that the werewolves seek on the upper class vampires.  Kate Beckinsale gives a good performance as the central ""death dealer"" of the vampires.  In the beginning diligently carries out her duty to hunt down and kill the werewolves, but as the story progresses she will learn of betrayals on many levels.  In the midst of this she falls in love with a ""human"" Michael Corvin who holds the key to everything.  Meanwhile, Lucian, is rallying the werewolves to defeat the vampires while conducting some odd genetic expirements.  One of the differences between this and other vampire/werewolf movies is that genetics is used to explain these creatures rather than myth and lore.

The effects and sound of the movie are great.  After watching the special features, you will learn that the techniques used in this movie are much more traditional with very little CGI animation.

At the end of the day, what you have is a moderately interesting movie with nice special features.  However, I doubt seriously that this is something that you will want to watch time and again.  For me that puts this DVD in the rent, don't buy category.",1106956800,,1765,5.031034482758621

1947480,2,B0000UI2NM,"How do you screw up a movie about werewolves battling against vampires.  Watch this movie and you'll find out how.  Where this movie goes wrong is by trying to include too much plot content involving too many characters and presented to the audience all in the wrong order.  By the end of the movie you actually understand what is going on, but just spent the whole movie not really sure of which side you were routing for.  The thing I hated about this movie is that it actually had solid potential and the story was even a good one.  The movie was very stylish and had above average special effects and decent action scenes.

That there was one of the big problems in the movie.  They spent too much time making the movie look good and stylish.  The producers were aiming for a cultish flavored hit and at least with me failed.  Watching the main chick vampire spend half the movie simply strutting tomboyishly around with an attitude that left a frost behind her, just doesn't do it for me.  By the end I could give a crap if she lived or died, in fact I found myself not caring about any of the characters let alone like any of them.  I will say that had they told the story in a different order, and from the beginning at least hinted behind some of the plot reasons for why this war was raging, I could probably have enjoyed it a whole lot more, only due to the fact that I'd know roughly who was good and who was bad.

This movie tries to be one part American Werewolf in Paris, one part Blade, one part The Matrix and turns out a stale example of mediocrity.  Anyone interested in getting a Blade knockoff fix would be better served watching something like Van Helsing.",1105574400,,1677,4.336538461538462
1947481,3,B0000UI2NM,"I had watched this movie the first time right when it came out but I just watched it again and decided this is a movie to speak on. Yes, I only give it three stars but this is average in my book and this film is average. It's no Interview with the Vampire, but compared to modern- day vampire movies, average is a great compliment. It had what we modern- day viewers love, a whole lot of weapons and fast movement and loud noises that will leave you deaf. The leather I think was a little cliche but oh well. Kate Beckingsale was actually quite good in this film compared to her paper- thin performance on Van Helsing. She pulled off being a no- nonsense, semi- feeling vampire and she fought well. The others actors were fine as well, but Kate Beckingsale is truly the only one who shines.

The plot is simple. Vampires against werewolves. Or so it seems. At the end of the movie you see there's a deeper meaning to the the head werewolf but I won't blow it away. But for the main body of vampires and werewolves it's just a main battle for power and dominance. Sounds cool.

But the movie lost two stars because of the hardly- there romance that was to be promised between the vampire Beckingsale and the man she's trying to save who eventually ends up a werewolf. The romance everyone was talking about was not there whatsoever between those two. Matter of fact, this movie is hardly emotional. It's cold and the characters are all stone- faced for the good part of the movie. So don't bother buying a box of tissues or anything. That's fine with me though, but when they say there's a romance I expect to see something brewing! Another problem was I didn't think they made the plot as great as it could have been. Maybe it's just me, but I was expecting more than what was given, and a little more depth to the characters.

Overall nonetheless, it was worth seeing once, and at least this movie respected the myth of vampires and werewolves, unlike so many other films. That much alone gives the film a solid three stars.",1105228800,,2025,4.409090909090909

But despite that one bonus point it is to this day, Miss Beckinsale has still yet to make a movie that doesn't suck (terribly). I mean COME ON! Does anyone really take her seriously in her Blade esque nay rip-off film role? Of course not! She looks like someone you could knock over with a feather, she hasn't even got that 'tough girl' demon slayer image feel to her, it's basically wrong actor for the wrong type of film.

I simply want to state that this film is destined to become a cult classic. Some of its many strong points include virtually non-CGI Lycans (even a scene where Lycans are running toward the camera on the walls of a corridor was done with stunt men and digitally erased cables); desaturated color, using digital technology, that provides this film with an amazingly beautiful Gothic look; and some fantastic action sequences that, although occasionally derivative, fit the storyline very well and do not seem forced in the least.

It's a shame that this extended/recut version of Underworld was not shown in theatres, because the edited theatrical release that generated critical trashing almost assuredly hurt the studio financially. Although I cannot compare the two versions, I can tell you that if audiences had seen this ""Unrated Extended Cut,"" Underworld would have been a critical and financial success, and deemed a major milestone in Gothic cinema.

1947487,4,B0000UI2NM,"Boiled down to the fine little dish of steak tar-tar that it is, ""Underworld"" is the answer to the two horror flick questions you had as a kid:

1) If Dracula and the Wolfman went mano a mano and fang-to-claw, which one would do the thrashing?

2) If Dracula and the Wolfman checked into a cheap motel, got roaring drunk on a case of Night Train, and had a baby, what would it look like?

You get the answer to #1 early and often, which is pretty much what this Transylvania Station is all about.  And by the end of ""Underworld"" you get #2 as well---and trust me, when it's hopping about like an ugly green Mini-Hulk (right down to its one-size-fits-all-monster trunks) you'll wish you hadn't.

You want to know what you're getting when you lace up your thigh-high attitude boots and strap on that trenchcoat for a little midnight fun in Len Wiseman's uber-stylish little monster mash ""Underworld""?

Think West Side Story: only here, instead of the Jets and the Sharks angling for a rumble on the other side of the tracks, we have Vampires and Werewolves.  Oh, and in ""Underworld"" nobody breaks into song.  Both sides just want to rumble, and the girls just wanna have fun. In the meantime, while not the sharpest stake in the vamp-hunter kitbag, ""Underworld"" finds its groove, and serves up a bloody two hours of unabashed techno-cool that drinks you dry, trashes the apartment and howls at the moon.

We get dropped into the middle of a war that Celine (the impossibly tasty Kate Beckinsdale)---our supple full-body-suit clad vampiric Death Dealer and narrator---tells us has been ""raging for centuries.""

On one side of the tracks: the sneering, brutally hip Euro-trashy leather-trenchcoat & hip-sunglasses wearing uber-high-maintenance Vampires.  They have posh high-rent neo-Victorian digs, drive around the streets in Jaguars and Maseratis, and have managed to switch up the silver bullets in their glocks and MP-5 submachine guns for something more lethal: liquid silver nitrate, which makes it tougher for their hairy buddies to pull the bullets out.  Advantage: Vampires.

On the other side of the tracks: the Salvation Army surplus-wearing tear-your-scalp-off-and-wear-it Werewolves---erm, I mean Lycans, short for Lycanthropes.  The Lycans are strictly low-rent, hang out together in what looks like an abandoned public lavatory, and take a bath once every full moon whether they need it or not.  Whereas their blood-sucking cousins from the East Side look like they'd be hanging at crazy underground raves when they're not boring each other to tears talking like the Merovingian, the Lycans are strictly the mosh-pit set.  Oh, and from what I could tell, there's not a single werewolf girl.  C'mon guys---haven't ya heard of ""Ginger Snaps""?  Bummer.  Advantage: Vampires.

That said, the boys have been pumping the rent money they've saved up into super-science research, giving them bullets that encase super-photoelectric magnesium charges (perfect for giving that oncoming vamp a little taste of Club Med sunlight).  They also have the upper hand in figuring out how they can mix the bloodlines, bringing the war between Vamp and Lycan to an end.  Advantage: Lycans.

And finally, mixing it up with our fanged-kissin' cousins, we have perplexed med student Michael Corvin (played by the annoying Scott Speedman who cashes a check) stalked by Lycan heavies and tagged by Selene, who wants to know why the werewolf army is so eager to get their hands on him.

And that, pretty much, is ""Underworld"": two hours of movie built around jaw-droppingly gorgeous set-pieces and bouts of total war between locked-and-loaded squads of Things that go Bump in the Night.

Just a note: you'll want to get the Unrated Extended DVD: it fleshes things out, beefs up some supporting characters, and ends with an extended battle sequence---and it's loaded down with plenty of extras you can sink your fangs into.

Plus, the sleeker transfer shows off Wiseman's technical mastery in spades.  Wiseman uses sound-stages and CGI to anchor the film's look, and tethers all of it to the fog-shrouded cobbled streets and ancient alleys of Prague: the City itself takes on a bleak and brooding character.  The movie looks gorgeous: whether it's the gloomy red-velvet and dark mahogany halls of the mansion, the sleek, sterile Underground, or the industrial ruins of the Lycans, Wiseman and cinematographer Tony Pierce-Roberts make every scene tell.  The sequence where a locomotive full of vampire diplomats chugs into a deserted rail-station---with the baying of werewolves in the distance---is jaw dropping.

""Underworld"" also gets the most out of its talented stable of actors.  There are three centers of gravity in the film: Beckinsdale, who doesn't need her bodysuit to command her lines (though I'm glad she wore it).  The Lycan overlord Lucien (the gifted Welsh actor Michael Sheen) steals every scene he's in, and brings complexity and command to a role that could have been a throwaway in lesser hands.  Finally, there's the Vampire King Viktor, played by the great Bill Nighy (who also played Shaun's Jag-loving stepdad in ""Shaun of the Dead"").  Nighy is a kind of demonic embodiment of immortal Puritan rage, and acts like a champ through all that make-up.

Even the supporting actors turn in strong roles: Shane Brolly (Kraven) whines and pouts and lisps and turns in a convincing performance as a spineless worm; Sophia Myles (Erika) comes off as a naughty little vampire cat-girl; Kevin Grevioux owns this film and puts the smack down as Uber-Werewolf Raze; and Hungarian actress Zita Gorog rocked my world---without uttering a single line.

In the end, this batwinged black-lipstick wearing looker of a flick charged into the goth club of my choice, served me an extra-bloody steak tartar , smacked me around, bought me drinks, and talked Shakespeare after.

There's a LOT that goes unexplained in this movie.  It takes as a given that you understand a little bit of monster lore - sunlight is deadly to vampires, silver just as deadly to werewolves and both of them can transmit their condition from a bite.  Beyond that it stumbles pretty badly into some new monster mumbo-jumbo.  It seems there are some humans who carry the strain of a virus which make it possible to withstand the bites of both where previously the bite of a vampire would kill someone previously bitten by a werewolf.  There are also some ""super-Vampires"" called ""The Elders"".  There are three elders, but two are always required to be in hibernation while one gets to be awakened for reasons that are never explained.

The film opens with an extended action sequence and other than a brief prologue voiceover that tells you that the war between vampires and lycans has gone on for over a thousand years, you don't know anything about the characters, so the extended fight in a subway feels more impersonal than a video game.

The final act involves one ""surprise"" after another.  Hidden secrets and treacherous alliances that seem to have been going on for centuries are all revealed over about 2 or 3 days - the keepers of the secrets suddenly become less good at keeping them once the cameras started rolling.

I could reveal more about the plot, but that would cut seriously into your enjoyment should you decide to watch ""Underworld"". The movie looks pretty good and the story, while basically a Vampire-Werewolf soap opera, at least goes somewhere.",1101686400,3,1822,4.789137380191693

If anything is (and I'm quoting) ""all surface, no substance, filled with derivative, grand-scale action,"" then it's definately the latter, not the former.  Underworld is a RARE gem!!  It's an action thriller that combines kick ass action sequences with great writing, stupendous acting and MIND-BLOWING special effects.  And the cinematography?  It just BLEW ME AWAY!!

You obviosly dont. Or you have never seen the original cut and just thought it would be cool to write a review. Im sorry i cant stand people who review like that,there are people out there trying to get a good feel about the movie before they drop $25 dollars on it,but some moron is going to tell you something completely untrue,oh! and he gives it like one star so it totally messes up the star rating,which is the first thing people usally look at,for some it may be the only thing. In fact there is 12 minutes of entirely new footage and like 15 min. of footage that has been redone this makes the movie from 4 to five stars it feels in all the gaps and plot which may have left some people guessing about certain things in the movie after watching the original release,this is a whole new movie and it is great. You could describe the action somewhat like the first Blade movie,but Underworld is for sure more serious about its content,its darker,and it really tries to show the grit of vampire and werewolves as where Blade is more comic book stile(dont get me wrong i love blade they are just two diffrent movies in the same genre and genrally about the same content)Underworld is just more well,freaky is a word i'll use. No need for me to tell you the plot theres plenty of reviews here for that,but one thing is for sure if you have a home theatre system this movie thumps hard,from the gunfire to the growling its great. And so is the picture quality it really works great with the dark lighting and feel to the movie. My one complaint is i see they have now put this movie on superbit well sort of they put the original release on superbit and did nothing for the extented release whats up with that if you buy this movie you have to but the extended version,come on columbia don't leave us hanging. Anyway if you enjoyed any of the following movies you MUST see this as it IS better than somme listed here...

Blade 1&2,Matrix(its better than the two sequels),Van Hellsing,

x-men,and similar movies you get the picture you don't have to be just an action fan to enjoy this there is some horror elenents to this one,Without a doubt watch this movie!",1101427200,3,2322,4.410256410256411

1947493,4,B0000UI2NM,"I'm sure there are many reviews about this movie under the regular release.  I'll comment a bit specifically about the superbit version that costs more for higher quality video and audio (without the extras on the disk).  To really get any advantage here you need to have a digital TV (preferably HD but ED will probably work too), a DVD player that puts out a progressive signal (vs. interlaced), and a component or digital connection between your DVD player and TV.  IMO if you don't have all three of these you won't get the benefit of Superbit and should save your money.

This was my first Superbit disk, so I had high expectations.  I'd say there's good news and bad news here.  The good news is that I do think the picture is visibly better.  There is definitely more detail and you can seem more subtle features (texture, reflections, etc.) in the picture.  This also helps some of the dark scenes (many in this movie) with more visible detail.  The bad news is that there's so much more detail that you can see the grain of the film.  I know that's normal for a movie shot on film and it doesn't really bother me (unless I'm looking for it).  However, I do think it detracts slightly from the perceived quality of the picture.  Compare this, for example, to a movie shot in digital and you'll see what I mean.  I'm sure there's some debate over what defines good picture quality so YMMV here.  Finally, the sound is excellent on this DVD, but I can't say that it's significantly better than on the original release over a Dolby Digital system.

So, in the end I'd say that Superbit is great if you really love a movie and want the best PQ you can get for it.  I think that Superbit is probably better for older movies that they can clean up for DVD transfer than for newer movies with a decent original DVD transfer.

Remember that if you want all the extras you won't get them on Superbit.  My one complaint about this specific DVD is that they used the theatrical release rather than the (now available) director's cut.

The dark and modern time vampire world is blended in with werewolf's and made into the 2 main characters.

Watching this a 2nd time, I have to say that this film was well done and the combining of two genres (vampire/warewolf) was a great idea!

All in all, very entertaining.

But she can, and Underworld was the perfect example to demonstrate it (unlike that awful thing called ""Pearl Harbor""). She took a simple but complex role, and made the best of it, not overacting, not becoming a cliche, but giving the character a lot of ""fuel"" (Carrie Ann-Moss should have learned from her when she played ""TRINITY"" in both sequences of MATRIX...)

And, sometimes, I just don't understand critics. This movie received a lot of backlash. Sue, it's far away from perfect, but critics are always complaining of brainless action flicks, with no substance (Bruckheimer-kind of movies)... UNERWORLD is nothing liek that. It constructs its history slowly and carefully, until reaching its climax.",1100044800,4,870,5.126760563380282
1947498,3,B0000UI2NM,"There must be something really wrong when the Extras in the DVD package is much more interesting than the main feature. Underworld is just that. The documentary on werewolves and vampires is enlightening enough, you can get the DVD just for that. If you're a budding filmmaker or comic book fan/artist, the sketches and making of features are very educational. That alone gives the film three stars.

The film itself, is simply trying-hard kewl. Having been a massive consumer of graphic novels, comic books and cheesy sci-fi/action/adventure/fantasy films from pre-pubescence to adulthood, I lowered my ""standards"" (if there's any) and expected some rip-roaring fanboy fun ala Riddick and Van Helsing (see my reviews). Boy, was I disappointed. The convoluted story aside (a staple in the comic-book genre), I was turned-off by the director's penchant for pretentious poses and making the camera linger so the audience can appreciate how cool his shots are (it is cool and has great lighting, in fairness, but does he have to be so obvious?). It seems he was trying very hard to out-Blade Blade and out-Matrix The Matrix. Too bad, the plot was kind of interesting yet his storytelling made it as hazy as a Transylvanian fog.  The revelation that reveals the true relationship of vampires and Lycans was also interesting but somehow became anti-climactic because of the numerous and heavy-handed foreshadowings, to make sure the viewer gets it. Oh, well, maybe my kids will find it cool when they turn 11.",1099440000,5,1504,5.08502024291498
1947499,5,B0000UI2NM,"I really liked this movie...Yeah yeah sure there was some FX effects takes from Matrix; however, what movie doesn't take from another.  I mean think about it..There are thousands of movies out there that have been rewritten because of the FX capabilities that we have today versus when it was done.  So let's get off this movie stole something from some other movie because hey it's done more than you ever know!!

Now as for the movie, I thought it was great.  I am such a collector of movies and have seen many movies about Vampires.  Personally I think they did an awesome job.

To me Selene is an awesome character and personally I liked her better than Trinity.  Selene wanted to do what was best for the convenant; however, the leader Kraven had other plans and lied about killing the lycan leader Lucian just so he could control the vampires and him and Lucian could create this super power.  Selene realized that Kraven was lying and went to find answers. What she didn't realize was that she was gonna find Michael who turned out to be someone she would protect, then care for him, and may even fall in love with him.

If you can remember back to the beginning Viktor's own daughter was in love with a Lycan (Lucian) and would have created the super power then; however, Viktor even admits that he couldn't allow this to happen because he himself would no longer be in power and would be hunted instead and that was his biggest fear was having the vampires lose power.

As for costumes I have to agree with Kristofer Kalkofen, Vampires and Werewolves are from Medival times.  Have you seen Van Halsing (sp) yet?  OMG they are wearing gothic clothing too.  Who would have ever thought!! Come on now.  If you think about it Vampires are dead..Why would they prance around in Hot Pink outfits?  Some people see immortality as a curse rather than a gift so you don't see cheery clothing in cases like that.  You would find people in dark colors or a ""gothic"" style.

Personally I can't wait to see the sequal because it will be interesting to see if Michael will stand up for Selene after she stood up for him or will he end up hunting her out and killing her.",1099180800,,2165,4.482142857142857

1947501,4,B0000UI2NM,"I wouldn't call it a ""Romeo and Juliet"" flick, mainly because the story focuses very little on any romance between Michael and Selene (Scott and Kate), and keeps the attention firmly placed on the constant battle between lycan and vampire.

Not that I'm complaining - the plot was strong, the special effects were killer, the plot twists were awesome, and Kate (in my opinion) breaks away from the fresh and clean persona to play a Lara Croft-esque, kick-butt character.

My only complaint is the annoyingly blue contacts (really, is that necessary?  If you're going for spooky eyes, make them glow or something, don't just slap on fake contact lenses), and the fact that it was touted as a Romeo-and-Juliet flick by so many critics, and wasn't.  I didn't mind that there was a decided lack of romance, but I wish they would have just said that, instead of making it seem as such.  Additionally, I wanted to kill Kraven five minutes in.

Overall, a definately good flick for vamp/werewolf lovers (with pretty darn good effects!  The scene with Michael in the back of the cop car was spectacular).  Go in with no expectations, and it'll undoubtedly be a hit.  Go in expecting superb acting and romantic chemistry between the hero and heroine, and look for another movie.  :D",1099094400,3,1273,4.798165137614679
1947502,4,B0000UI2NM,"Let me say right up front, I love monster movies, and I'm very forgiving of their flaws.  For some reason nothing gets me into a movie like a good werewolf.  If you're like me and you love supernatural critters onscreen, then this is the flick for you.

A sort of industrial remake of ""Romeo and Juliet,"" ""Underworld"" pits warring clans of vampires and werewolves against one another in a dark, stormy, goth-chic world straight out of ""The Matrix"" or its far superior predecessor ""The Crow.""  Our Juliet is the vampires' chief assassin, while Romeo is a hapless med student bitten by our heroine's furry foes.

Yes, this is a movie that stresses style and visual spectacle far above plot and substance.  So what?  You came to see a movie about a hot vampiress in leather shooting up a bunch of werewolves, you can't expect Oscar material here.  That said, there are some refreshingly unexpected plot twists, and the line between protagonist and antagonist often becomes blurred -- or flipped completely.  There are no good guys or bad guys here: you can choose whichever beastie you like to root for.  (Personally I'm a werewolf kind of guy.)

Horror fans will also be happy to see a mummy of sorts and another supernatural predator later on which can only be described as incredibly geek-cool.  The leader of the werewolves is a definite scene-stealer, what with his slight frame, arm sword, and ability to simply spit out silver bullets by flexing.  Trust me, he's a fun character.

This is a popcorn flick, people, and a fun one.  From flourescent bullets to black leather SWAT teams, sit back and enjoy the mindless catharsis of a monster-on-monster gang war.",1099008000,4,1663,4.806338028169014

1947504,4,B0000UI2NM,"Wiseman very capably directed this film, based on a good script with some intriguing twists on the legends of vampires and werewolves. First of all, this is a great DVD from a picture and surround sound viewpoint, allowing you to enjoy the great special effects, stunts, and delightfully gloom sets. Seeing the Widescreen really made it more impressive than a first viewing on satellite TV. Some of the stunts (and costumes) will remind you of the Matrix.

The plot moves quickly and tells a old story with some really enjoyable and intriguing twists on vampires and werewolves. The story is suspensful, as you work to figure out who is good and bad, but the twists are also logical which makes them all the more fun. There is some mild gore and a good bit of nicely stylized violence, but the violence never overwhelms the action and the acting nor does it seem overdone or gratuitous. Overall, I thought this was a good blend of action, horror and suspense. My wife and I have shown it several times to friends, and we enjoy it more and see more details each time we see it. We really hope that a sequel does appear, because this movie was a lot of fun.

Pretty much, the vampires and the werewolves are having a war that has lasted for centuries. The werewolves have a plot to create a hybrid species between the vampires and werewolves, which will be stronger than both. Although the real plot is more complicated than that, thats it in a nutshell. I really thought the storyline was interesting all the way through, and the acting was pretty good. But the thing that really aggravates me about this movie, are the guns they use. This really had the potential to be a really great action movie, but when the action sequences come and the vampires and werewolves are just shooting eachother, that kind of defeats the purpose of making them vampires and werewolves, they might as well be humans.

1947506,4,B0000UI2NM,"Underworld, while rooted in an eternal strife between vampires and lycanthropes - something that in itself is more rooted in roleplaying games that actual history, is a film with Shakespearean and Copollan themes. At the heart of the story is a Montague versus Capulet rivalry so old that the original cause has been forgotten by all but a few. This is where the Romeo and Juliet influences cease. Underworld, as the title suggests, is mostly symbollic of the criminal underworld of organized crime. There is tradition, hierarchy, turf, consolidations of power, and treaties between enemies.

Kate Beckinsale is a death dealer, a play on vampire hunters, but with a twist: she hunts werewolves. Following the ganster themes in the film, Beckinsale is a soldier for her family. Beckinsale's performance is mostly soulless, but so is that of the rest of the cast. This is perhaps where Underworld remains faithful to our established perception of vampires and werewolves. The lycanthropes are passionate and tempermental, and are savage in the way they fight and kill. Contrast this to the vampires who are cool, aloof, distance... a bit dull.

I don't believe that this is the result of bad acting on the part of the vampire cast - even if there are a couple of actors who don't shine particularly bright. The existential treatment given to vampire personalities has been established in earlier vampire franchises, namely The Hunger and Kindred: The Embraced. Vampires in Underworld have a kind of royal tradition, so making the nobles somewhat reminiscent of the Windsors helps the film.

What I enjoy about Underworld is the fast paced action and that aforementioned blend of vampire and mobster movies. I anticipated combat involving tooth and nail, literally; and I was pleasantly surprised at the deeply involved (and exciting) gun fights. The pressures put upon Beckinsale and others because of tradition and habit are the kind that are found in Scorsese and Coppola crime dramas. Make no mistake however, you won't be seeing a revised Godfather or Goodfellas. set to a hypergothic vampiric themes. Rather, what you will get is a vampire film that takes itself seriously and strives for originality. Whether it achives orginality however, is up to the viewer.

I remember and loved Frank Langella's Dracula back when it was a new movie. So, I have my own expectations about vampire films in general. I still found much to enjoy in this movie. If Underworld represents a new generation of vampire films along with Blade, then I am very excited for the future of the genre.

I'm giving Underworld a four-star rating for the quality of the DVD, its extras, as well as the quality audio production done in the film. I also enjoyed the visual work of the film. Underworld is a darker movie, certainly darker than Copolla's Dracula in terms of color and light. The film's colors are muted, making the film more dramatic. As a side note, those interested in seeing how color and light add tension to a film should see Mamoru Oshii's landmark film, Avalon. The only complaint I have for Underworld is the less-than-convincing CG work done on transformed werewolves. It's still better than what the previous decade of horror films brought, though I don't feel it stands up to An American Werewolf in London, and I certainly don't feel it measures up in the age dominated by films like The Lord of the Rings and the new Star Wars prequals.",1098057600,,3434,4.9342560553633215

1947509,2,B0000UI2NM,"Before one can properly criticize Underworld, one needs to excise the elements lifted whole cloth from ""The Matrix:""

04. Comic book ""look down"" shots
05. Bullet Time effects

08. Raindrops
09. Orchestral soundtrack
10. Pop Soundtrack
11. Chosen one mythos
12. Character: Michael Corvin (IS Neo)
13. Character: Selene (IS Trinity)

I think basically Len Wiseman (director) saw the Matrix, phoned some film executives and said: ""let's take the most original SF movie in years and remake it, this time with Vampires and Werewolves.""

Now that we have gotten that out of the way, we can critique what's left of ""Underworld.""

The Mythology.

Nice job here.  I liked the idea of the Lycans (and using a variation on the word Lycanthropy) being the Vampire's slaves and the 'star-crossed lovers' plot device (nod to Shakespeare, of course). The extended cut really expanded on this.

The Visual Ideas

Aren't we all sick to death of Vampires being tragic, doom-obsessed goths? Puts the 'ring back in BORING. For a spectacular re-imagining of the genre, rent the British miniseries ""Ultraviolet."" It's the best thing to happen to Vampires since, well, immortality.

The Story

They actually did a nice job of trying to keep it fairly believable. I have to give credit here. It seems that since so many of the other elements had already been developed (and previously filmed) they had time to really sit down and hash out the story. Kudos.

The Performances

Trinity vs. Selene

The very quality that Carrie-Ann Moss gave Trinity is what Kate Beckinsale did NOT give Selene. There is a vulnerability and a sense of things going on behind the eyes with Trinity that makes her an intriguing character rather than the mindless video-game killing machine that is Selene. There is nothing interesting about Selene; she's is one note affair from beginning to end. There were rumors that Beckinsale spurned some convention fans by saying of Undwerworld: 'it's only a bloody comic book.' Well, if that's the extent of the thought she put behind Selene, it really shows.

The supporting cast were stellar. Michael Sheen as the lycan leader and Shane Brolly as the vampire leader were very good.  Speedman acquitted himself rather well also.

Not a bad little film given all the caveat's above.  Curious as to what they do with #2 (oh yes, it's already underway).  Perhaps a cameo by Hugo Weaving?",1097539200,4,2572,5.052132701421801

Back to the movie. It is about a vampire who falls in love with a human. This human, Michael, is bitten by a werewolf and begins to see flashbacks of memories of the strongest Lycan. This werewolf's name was Lucian. As Selene(Kate Beckinsale) tries to help Michael....Just buy the movie already.

The themes are so universal that they could also apply to the prejudice that whites and blacks (or Asians)might face if they intermarried during the Civil War or anytime before the Civil Rights Movement. The first time I saw it I really, really disliked it. Why? It seemed as if it was too deriative. Hindsight is 20/20 as they say. When I went back to watch it again with a a friend I really enjoyed ""Underworld"" for what it is.

Selene (Kate Beckindale)is a Deathdealer--her job is to hunt down and kill Lycans (Werewolves). It seems the two species have been at war for thousands of years. At one time the Lycans were slaves watching over their masters the Vampires while they slept and protecting them in times of turmoil. That changed due to some pivotal event in the past.

Things change when Selene while on a hunt for two Lycans discovers they were hunting a mortal (Scott Speedman). They weren't doing it for food or sport. Instead Lucian (Michael Sheen)has some special purpose for this human. When Selene begins to suspect that Kraven (Shane Brolly)who leads the vampires might have betrayed her kind, she takes it upon herself to discover who this human is and what his importance might be to the Lycans.

Stylish and well directed by Len Wiseman from a story conceived by Wiseman (a former art director on ""Stargate SG1"", writer Danny McBride (""The Outer Limits"" and a stunt co-ordinator/actor on many film projects) andactor/stuntman Kevin Grevioux (who also appears in the film as a Lycan), ""Underworld"" may borrow its look from ""The Matrix"" but the themes in the story are as old as the Greek tragedies. Is it a deep film? Hardly. Combining the story, stunts and a sharp visual sense makes ""Underworld"" more than the sum of its influences.

This deluxe set includes the unrated extended cut of the film. What that amounts to a new subplot involving the vampire Erika (Sophia Myles), back story information on Scott Speedman's character Michael and an extended grand finale involving the fight between the werewolves and the vampires. Featuring a new commentary track with stars Beckinsale, Speedman and director Wiseman, this edition is closer in final form to the film Wiseman wanted released. It had to be recut for reasons of pacing and theatrical exhibition. In addition to the original featurettes on the single disc DVD, we also get a 50 minute documentary ""Fang vs. Fiction"" discussing the history and lore of vampires and werewolves. There's also outtakes and some additional featurettes on the making of the film.

The transfer of the Extended Edition looks marvelous. Once again, it appears to be a high definition transfer and, while there's is occasional edge enhancement and halos, the overall look of the film is terrific. The 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound will give your speakers a work out as well. I prefer the two commentary tracks on the original DVD with the theatrical cut but the commentary track here along with the additional footage which adds more to the plot, documentary and featurettes makes ""Underworld The Extended Edition"" a must for fans of the film. While the look of the film borrowed quite a bit from ""The Matrix"" (which, in turn, borrowed from ""Dark City""), Wiseman manages to make the overall look integral to this film. Overall, ""Underworld"" is quite an achievement for a first feature film. Evidently in November of this year Wiseman, Beckinsale and McBride will begin work on the first sequel for Screen Gems for a release set for mid-2005.",1095465600,14,3638,4.89935064935065

1947516,5,B0000UI2NM,This is one of those movies with an ending that could mean anything in the sequel.  It really makes you think.  So muckh better than Van Helstink!,1095465600,,146,4.37037037037037
1947517,4,B0000UI2NM,"it was great to watch this movie in the theatre. it had a somewhat predictable plot even for a hybrid movie. the action goes along the lines of the blade flicks, but without the smug remarks of whistler to lighten it up a bit. it was very, very dreary with almost all color stricken from the film, just the way a vampire or a werewolf story should be.

the werewolves, or lycans as they are called, are represented as typically dumb creatures with only a few with slight intelligence. the vampires are exactly what you would expect from the people working at any hot topic store. the setting of gothic buildings and and just plain bleakness made it plainly obvious this was a nighttime movie. the special effects were about par with most other supernatural movies, but nothing really to complain about. the script was a little over the top, but that was what i was expecting. there was absolutely nothing spoken that didn't deal with the plot which was about the war between vampires and lycans. it would have made it a little more interesting if they would have added conversations that didn't consist of just the war, maybe add something outside the war.

the weapons were those i had come to expect from the blade movies. ultraviolet bullets and silver shurikins. it was as if they were stealing straight from the blade mythology with that one. other then that the weapons were still nice in action.

they don't specifically say when this movie is supposed to take place which adds to the timeless effect. they just say that this war has been waged for hundreds of years. i would say judging by the weaponry and vehicles, it would be in the next couple of decades, but who's to say?

overall, good movie, little flaws but anyone who doesn't want to overemphisize on the flaws will enjoy. the flaws i would have to say are their only because of the previous myths made up by other writers and movie producers so they really aren't flaws at all if you just watch this movie from the perspective that it is a movie on its own.",1095033600,3,2026,4.542465753424658
1947518,4,B0000UI2NM,"I've overlooked Underworld for awhile, mainly because I thought it was gonna be yet another Matrix and/or Blade redux. But I recently viewed the ""unrated extended cut"", and I gotta admit...all nitpicking aside, it drew me in & grabbed my attention. For 2+ hours, I bought into the idea of the ""Underworld"". I didn't get Shakespeare, nor was I expecting it...I enjoyed it for what it was, and I'll definitely be checking it out again (as well as the Underworld sequel, whenever it's released).

Even if our opinions differ about the storyline, acting, etc., I'd still recommend checking this version out just for the visuals alone. The storyline IS kinda foggy, but it kinda reminded me of waking up from a visually intense dream & struggling to grasp what exactly it was about. When basking in the surreal visuals of Underworld, maybe a little ambiguity in the storyline is necessary for the whole idea to work. And if you're still on the fence, I have four words for you: Kate Beckinsale in leather. If THAT doesn't entice you to check out Underworld, then God bless ya...",1094515200,6,1073,4.768817204301075
1947519,4,B0000UI2NM,"This movie is 100% action. Nothing here is going to illuminate the human condition or discuss any sort of heavy philosophy that much of good science fiction is renowned for. Ignoring that, and rating this movie purely in the escapism genre, we thing it rates fairly highly. It will be interesting to see if an audience develops for this film. The thing was absolutely crushed by negative reviews (a pity because Beckinsale is really so good in this film) and it did not do well at the box office. If it had just a little more going for it then we might feel more confident about it achieving a kind of cult status. As it is, we think the merits of the film might go unrecognized. It will do little to change the genre.

WHO SHOULD WATCH:

For those of you looking for more excitement and less deep thought, Underworld is a fine, fine choice. Don't watch the Blade films. Ignore the myriad marshal-arts inspired works. This is a movie of real worth that delivers given the limitations of the super-action genre. It feels much more like The Crow than anything else and people who enjoyed that film we feel will like this a great deal as well.

WHO SHOULD AVOID:

Provocative philosophy is wholly absent here. Movies that deal in this style and that subject matter are firmly in the domain of The Matrix and The Ghost in the Shell among others. This is the sort of movie that improves with a couple of beers to urge along the suspension of disbelief and allow for that immersive joy that some action movies are able to deliver. Another segment of audience that should avoid this film is that particular group that enjoys the romantic vampire. There is no romantic vampire here. None. Gone are the seductions, the languid coolness, and the deviousness of popularized vampires of the Bram Stoker come Anne Rice world. These vampires shoot guns. They're not very devious. There is a certain formality and decadence to the culture that reminds one of decaying Rome, which is a strong selling point to the overall plot and should've been explored more, but that is the only similarity to those pulp-fiction vampires.

1947520,5,B0000UI2NM,"Blade was interesting, but to me it failed emotionally. You just do not connect with the film on the personal level. The effects were super, but that was the main impact...""wow what amazing effects"". You feel like breaking out in a chorus of Peggy Lee's Is That All There Is. Special effects alone cannot make a movie great.

Underworld makes that jump, great FX work, but also gives you characters you really care about, ones that you really love to hate. A strong plot line designed to hook you and keep you, just does that. With the emotional involvement, there is a greater impact, a movie that will demand repeat viewing. Instant Cult Status.

The movie grabs you from the opening and never lets up with the pace. Firm direction and with a driving score, the movie reaches for perfection. You have a 1000-year-old war between Lycons and Vampires, and it's all coming to a head. It's a well thought out and executed premise and Kate Beckinsale shines! She is an amazing talent. I first adored her work in Cold Comfort Farm as Robert Post's child Flora. When you compare that gentle, deft bit of humour with this kick a*** vampire hunter, it proves what an overlooked talent she is. With Van Helsing out now (and I am sure this movie led to her landing the role), she is finally getting a spotlight she so well deserves.

A gloomy, atmospheric ambiance to the whole movie is maintained all the way through, adding a strong foundation for the otherworld premise. I am sure some will nitpick things, as all vampire film faces, but kudos for the vibrant energy and sheer edgy feel to the film.

It leaves you hanging, clearly open for a sequel...one can but hope it maintains this high quality.

Kate rocks...you don't need to know anymore! It has about 13 minutes of footage not in the original.  A great battle scene and some backstory on Michael.  Rounds out the film nicely without dragging it down.  A great pounding soundtrack, too!",1094256000,51,1938,4.646198830409356
1947521,4,B0000UI2NM,"I would rather visit the dentist than watch a horror film; for me life is scary enough without seeking further trauma. Underworld kept me watching, however, when less gory films like ""The Unseen"" would have had me turning the television off. First of all, I liked the premise of Vampire death squads hunting down Werewolf dens, and I understood the backstory without a problem.

The film's look is suitably dark, decrepit, and nasty; the Lycans live in an underground bunker that looks like it was transported from the battle of Stalingrad, while the Vampires stand around a gated mansion looking like mid-70's rock stars.

Kate Beckinsale plays Selena, a death-dealer who suspects the vampire left to run her coven, Craven (bad name) is conspiring with the werewolves.  She is loyal to Viktor, the sleeping leader of her coven.  Meanwhile, Lucian, the leader of the Lycans pursues a human who holds the key to a genetic transformation that will free the werewolves from the domination of the Vampires.

Underworld moves quickly enough that the sheer silliness of the plot doesn't impede the action, and Kate Beckinsale is eye candy enough to make compelling viewing.  The last act of the movie, however, a battle between Viktor, played by Bill Cighy (whom I last saw in ""Love Actually) and the vampire/werewolf hybrid, leaving Kate Beckinsale to grimace for the last ten minutes of the film, is less climactic than the film needs.

This film has interesting tones of racism that impelled me to keep watching, because the driving engine of Underworld isn't gore or blood splashing or reviving corpses, or bullets splaying, but Romeo as a werewolf and Juliet as a vampire, which is funny and sad. Yes, I hate horror films. Yes, I will watch Underworld again.",1094256000,2,1757,4.935593220338983
1947522,4,B0000UI2NM,"I am not sure why I saw this movie, its not usually the kind of movie I like. I probably just was in a bad mood and wanted to see loads of pale people in dark clothes, blood, full moon and rainy streets. So far, so good. It is a well made story, though I am not sure what the story is. It is entertaining and it makes some effort with creating an appropriate atmosphere including the way it is told by a narrator. The movie has some highlights (I esp. like the scene where half of his head slips off)  but it lacks from the absence of a ""hero(ine)"" or whatever central character to identify with. It would make a good pc-game without much alteration.",1094083200,,650,4.158730158730159
1947523,3,B0000UI2NM,"""Underworld"" is fun to watch, but it's really nothing more than an average sci-fi/action flick.  One thing is for sure, this movie is in no way a horror film.  Take any standard action yarn, replace the good guys with vampires and the bad guys with werewolves.  Next, throw in a twist that bonds one of the goodies and baddies together.  Finally, blend in a betrayal and a cover-up and you basically have the storyline.  There's nothing new here.

The two supernatural enemies really don't even use their powers against each other that much.  The ""death dealer"" vampires have more guns than a cult in Waco.  They don't even get close to ripping open the necks of their enemies. The werewolves, for the most part, are happy reliving scenes from ""Fight Club"" in the city's subway tunnels.

Don't think that this flick isn't enjoyable, though.  It is visually fun to watch and the action is pretty good.  I just wish that the vamps and wolves could have used their powers a little more than their guns.  The betrayal and cover-up mentioned earlier does actually make you pull for one side of the conflict a little more than the other, but in the end, you just want to see these folks beat the heck out of each other until someone yells, ""Uncle!""

If you want real vampire or werewolf action, check out a movie like ""Interview With The Vampire""(better yet, read the book), or ""Silver Bullet""(again, the book is better).  If you just want a little brainless action, ""Underworld"" will suffice.",1093996800,,1487,4.691119691119691
1947524,4,B0000UI2NM,Originally I was disinclined to see this movie. I thought it was going to be some cheesey vampire movie. I was channel surfing the other night and came across the movie on HBO and figured it won't hurt to watch it and if anything I'll fall asleep.  I was up till 5am making sure i saw the end. The movie is very intersting and keeps you glued. The emotions and attitudes of the characters are believable. The computer graphics are obvious but they look good. The storyline is a bit up in the air. It seems that the writers just wanted to get some information out about vampires and werewolves and their histories together. Aside from that the movie played well and kept me awake when i expected to fall asleep.

1947526,4,B0000UI2NM,"Underworld starts out with a long action sequence. Things do slow down enough for us to learn that our hero is a vampire by the name of Selene, played by Kate Beckinsale, who has devoted her unlife to destroying lycanthropes. Selene stumbles upon a conspiracy between the vampire leader, Kraven, and the werewolf leader, Lucian, which involves a human named Michael, who is a host to a strain of some strain of plague that is never explained. Fearing that Kraven's actions may place the vampires in jeopardy, Selene does the unthinkable; she awakens the ancient vampire noble, Viktor so he can stop Kraven.

In the middle of the movie we move away from some of the action and we get our characters doing a lot of talking, plotting, and running through dark wet streets. We get all of our back-story of how the vampire/werewolf war got started in the first place via flashbacks. And there's a forbidden romance budding between Selene and Michael.

The movie looks sufficiently offbeat to be interesting, although the muted colors and lack of anything resembling bright light becomes does get a little old. Be nice to see what the vampires did when the sun was up. Kate Beckinsale does look dangerous and sexy in a skintight leather suit, but there is not much acting for her to do in this film. Scott Speedman doesn't need to do anything more than exude a primal wildness, which he succeeds at. And everyone else has to appear sinister.

Even though, I found Underworld be an entertaining view. The big battle at the end is fun, although the final scene seems to be an introduction for a sequel. So get your popcorn, and watch the movie. You will not be sorry...though it is no one I will be watching multiple times.",1093737600,,1715,4.672185430463577

The story did need to be fleshed out a little more, but I don't think the movie suffered from that too much. There is a debate over whether the vampires should be going around shooting at werewolves (or lycans as they are called here) instead of hand to hand combat, but I found that a bit refreshing as the hand to hand can get a little tiresome after a while.  Kind of made the whole thing more modern, as it were. The thing that detracted a little bit for me was the horrible acting of the guy who played the vampire Kraven.  I almost thought this was a B-movie when you can see him struggling to have an emotion other than brooding idiot.  Scott Speedman was a surprise, in that I've never found him too alluring and here he was very sexy and I thought the chemistry between him and Kate was really good.  I am looking forward to the love story progressing further in the sequel.

1947532,4,B0000UI2NM,"I have been a big vampire mythology fan for as long as I can remember. I love a good vampire movie. I'm not expecting Masterpiece Theater, I just want to be entertained, and entertained I was with ""Underworld"". I missed out seeing the movie when it was in the theaters but I'm glad that I did now that I have seen the extended cut. I'm not really a fan of Kate Beckinsdale film work but she does a great job as death dealer (i.e vampire) Selene. Selene is trying to figure out why the Lycans (i.e werewolves), the vampires' enemies, what they want in Michael Corvin (played by Scott Speedman of ""Felicity"" fame). The Lycans and death dealers are at war and have been for centuries. I loved the dark, moody atmosphere of the entire film. I thought it was amazing how the werewolves were actually costumes as opposed to resorting to the cheesy CGI most movies relies on nowadays (which I think is way too much). Kate Beckinsdale looked great in that skintight leather outfight and short dark hair. She reminded me a lot of Toni Halliday, the singer from the modern rock band Curve. The film is very sleek and stylish. I can definitely see where the comparisons of the movie to other films like ""The Matrix"" and ""Blade"" comes in (like on the fight sequences) but ""Underworld"" still holds its own. There really wasn't much of a plot the one big flaw I found with the film but I didn't care. It was a non-stop thrill ride for me. The acting was a bit on the overstated side but like I said, this ain't Masterpiece Theater. If you want Masterpiece Theater, then go watch some (awful) Merchant Ivory film. ""Underworld"" is a fun, non-stop rollercoaster ride (or at least I thought). The bonus features on the dvd is awesome. I especially dug the ""Fangs Vs. Fiction"" segment and watching the cast of the film talk about making the film. I loved the outtake reel. It is always interesting for me to see the actors goof up on their lines in movies. You don't see that very often except as bonus footage on dvds. I liked the 48 page comic book and the sketchings on the entire film. I am eagerly anticipating the sequel to ""Underworld"" where Selene becomes the hunted.",1092528000,19,2156,4.488549618320611
1947533,2,B0000UI2NM,"I didn't have high expectations when I went to see this in the movie, but I was looking forward to seeing it. All in all it was a let down. The director was out of his depth and the plot and script were silly.

This could have been a cool, gothy flick, with fans applauding any shameless MATRIX ripoffs. It could have gone for a campy appeal, relying on some interesting special effects to hold it up. Instead, it is unintentionally campy, humorless and the action sequences overall were boring.

The plot, some sort of zero sum political battle between Werewolves and Vampires, when in the end they should all just get along, is a stinker. We have Werewolves versus Vampires, Vampires versus Vampires, and Big Movie versus Audience Apathy. In the end, neither Movie nor Audience win. And as for Werewolves versus Vampires, who cares?

The political plotline is uninteresting, all betrayals will be telegraphed before you get the DVD out of the packaging, and the script is mainly the same two or three conversations/arguments ocurring over and over.

The first action scene--in the subway--was cool. But the rest of the movie doesn't live up to it. One of the biggest problems with the action sequences was the almost total absence of innocent and oblivious Humans. The neat thing about the first MATRIX was that you were in on a secret while society-at-large was filled with a bunch of unhip squares, totally unaware of all the neato things and swell drama happening around them. If you are going to have cool action scenes in a movie like this, you want to have chaos and battles with a bunch of rubes getting in the way. More realistic that way. The gloomy Eastern European cityscape is cool, but it's not enough.

Kate Beckinsale is a fine actress, and works hard to carry this thing, but in the end the overly-obvious attempt to set up a sequel looks a little desperate. I'm surprised that they are still going ahead with one, apparently due to start filming in September 2004. Apart from a few diehards and a mandatory goth presence, I doubt a lot of people will be willing to give the second one a chance, let alone a third if they're serious about a trilogy.

1947534,5,B0000UI2NM,"Somewhat lost in 2003's ""sequel-o-rama"" was this sci-fi/action masterpiece released Sept 19 of that year. Here we have great originality of script & ambience; the 'underworld' war raging between vampires & lychens (werewolves), complete with modern-day weaponry & very believeable scenarios makes this the thriller of the year. Beckinsale's character was a bit oversold, although she did perform well above my expectations as a ""Master Death Dealer"" of the vampire clan.

The film's shining star is in fact, the screenwriting & directing; both lending to the always-night-time ambience & the subtle but convincing eerieness of the entire plot. The Script brings many sub-plots along with the main story, making this a 'see it again' classic.

Yes, Matrix & Terminator sequels are great...but when is the last time we were graced with leather-clad vampires sporting full-auto 9mm. assault pistols?",1092355200,,896,5.4855072463768115
1947535,4,B0000UI2NM,"Len Wiseman's Underworld has to be taken for what it is: an action film dressed up in goth-couteur with vampires and werewolves. This film doesn't have the scares of other films that include either a vampire or a werewolf or both. It is without any kind of apology a dark, gothic action film.

Underworld's story owes alot to Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, and White Wolf Gaming's Werewolf: Rage and Vampire the Masquerade. Any fans of those two pen-and-paper urban gothic role-playing game would see alot of similarities in Wiseman's film. The film starts off pretty quickly and doesn't really let up until the final scene. There are a few scenes sprinkled throughout the film to let the viewer catch its breath. These scenes would be just as good as the action sequences if not for the scenery-chewing of Shane Brolly's Kraven. Looking like a stereotypical Euro-trash vampire, Brolly's Kraven doesn't know the meaning of understated acting. Some have mentioned that Bill Nighy's vampire elder Viktor does the same, but I thought Nighy's performance was very convincing and very in-character.

The person who really holds the film together was Kate Beckinsale. Who knew that she could be convincing as an action-heroine. Her petite form and soft-spoken demeanor actually gives her ass-kicking character some sex-appeal and both fuses well together. It didn't hurt that she pretty much spent almost the entire lenght of the film in some outfit that was all black, and either leather or latex or a combination of both. Ms. Beckinsale is both hot and dangerous in this film.

The action sequences owes alot of The Matrix and the other imitators that showed up after the release of that film. Unlike, most Matrix imitators, Underworld doesn't overuse the slo-mo, 360-degree shots that the Wachowski Brothers' film made popular. The FX work for the werewolf change is done well, but sometimes when the Were's arrive on the scene in large groups it still has a certain artificial look to them. But overall, the film's FX work was good enough to avoid scrutiny.

Len Wiseman has already announced that Underworld 2 will be made once everyone involved in the first film get their schedules straightened out. The ending of this film really needs a sequel to continue the story that really just started with this film. Underworld is fun and a rollercoaster of a goth-action-thriller.

This dvd edition is much better than the first version. The extra scenes that were put back into the film helped smooth out the film's story and pacing. This version should've been the one to have been released in the theaters. When i first saw the film, some of the scenes just didn't make much sense, but in this extended cut they made much more sense. The overall look of the film in this dvd edition is much better. The blacks are more solid and deeper. The shadows in this film really stand-out. The audio will give any home theater system a run for its money. Whether its from the industrial rock score or the heavy bass during the gunfights.

For just a few more dollars, this dvd edition is worth the price. But for anyone who doesn't own a home theater system alot of the perks of this edition will be lost. I'd recommend they pick the first edition instead",1091750400,7,3243,4.834234234234234

What I did not like was the way it was all put together.  Many of the scenes were filmed from odd angles, and the editing tended to be crude, wasting a lot of time between scenes, where a shorter edit, while not removing anything, would move the picture along a little faster.

In viewing the attached specials, it becomes clear why this is so.  the creators have a wonderful vision and know what they want to show us, but this is a young crew.  Even their experienced cinematographer has never worked on a movie of this type.  The result is that their vision is hampered by a lack of experience.

1947537,4,B0000UI2NM,"Len Wiseman's Underworld has to be taken for what it is: an action film dressed up in goth-couteur with vampires and werewolves. This film doesn't have the scares of other films that include either a vampire or a werewolf or both. It is without any kind of apology a dark, gothic action film.

Underworld's story owes alot to Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, and White Wolf Gaming's Werewolf: Rage and Vampire the Masquerade. Any fans of those two pen-and-paper urban gothic role-playing game would see alot of similarities in Wiseman's film. The film starts off pretty quickly and doesn't really let up until the final scene. There are a few scenes sprinkled throughout the film to let the viewer catch its breath. These scenes would be just as good as the action sequences if not for the scenery-chewing of Shane Brolly's Kraven. Looking like a stereotypical Euro-trash vampire, Brolly's Kraven doesn't know the meaning of understated acting. Some have mentioned that Bill Nighy's vampire elder Viktor does the same, but I thought Nighy's performance was very convincing and very in-character.

The person who really holds the film together was Kate Beckinsale. Who knew that she could be convincing as an action-heroine. Her petite form and soft-spoken demeanor actually gives her ass-kicking character some sex-appeal and both fuses well together. It didn't hurt that she pretty much spent almost the entire lenght of the film in some outfit that was all black, and either leather or latex or a combination of both. Ms. Beckinsale is both hot and dangerous in this film.

The action sequences owes alot of The Matrix and the other imitators that showed up after the release of that film. Unlike, most Matrix imitators, Underworld doesn't overuse the slo-mo, 360-degree shots that the Wachowski Brothers' film made popular. The FX work for the werewolf change is done well, but sometimes when the Were's arrive on the scene in large groups it still has a certain artificial look to them. But overall, the film's FX work was good enough to avoid scrutiny.

Len Wiseman has already announced that Underworld 2 will be made once everyone involved in the first film get their schedules straightened out. The ending of this film really needs a sequel to continue the story that really just started with this film. Underworld is fun and a rollercoaster of a goth-action-thriller.",1091664000,4,2375,5.020304568527918
1947538,5,B0000UI2NM,"I picked up this DVD edition today, and having not seen the film, I was relying on the fact that it was the ""2-disc edition loaded with features"" to make it worthwhile if the film happened to be of poor quality. I've read many reviews of this film, and most have butchered it saying that it is a ripoff action film of 'The Matrix' or 'Blade', and that its characters and plot are very weak. This is only partly true. If you watch the film with very high expectations, then yes, you may think of it that way. However, if you accept that it's a film from first-timers Len Wiseman and Danny McBride, and give it some leeway, it can be very entertaining. The one thing I must say is that this film isn't as much of an action film as the creators lead you to believe. Sure, there are action scenes, but they don't overshadow the plot. The action scenes work within the plot, instead of vice versa.

 The only notable performance is Kate Beckinsale's. She is excellent as the vampire Selene, and she looks really hot in the tight leather outfit. Other acting in the film is average.

 The action scenes in the film are amazing. The big shootouts come at the beginning and end of the film, but there are little action snipits throughout. The reason people have tagged this as a ripoff of 'The Matrix' is that the creators decided to use stop-motion camera styles in some areas. Slow-mo is used in some of the action scenes, and I have to say that it only makes them better.

 Bogged down by all its negative reviews, 'Underworld' has nevertheless become another one of my favorite films. The film really is very good, despite what many critics have said. The key to enjoying this movie is to not expect much from it. A worthy plot interwoven with action scenes galore make this film an excellent addition to the genre.",1091664000,5,1811,4.45619335347432

If you like the concept of an updated vampire movie, see _Blade_ again. But at all costs skip this waste of a DVD. Unless I fell asleep during a key exposition sequence (which is possible), I could not make sense of the vampire mythos in this movie. Vampires - immortal creatures - need 'awakening' (resuscitating)? Are they just too lazy to deal with the day-to-day drudgery of immortality? Vampires can faint from *blood loss*? Vampires need CPR after near-drowning events? (Ask yourself during this scene: isn't drowning, being defined as a suppression of the oxygenation of blood, really more of a problem for the living than the undead?) Advice to the Lycans: skip the expensive UV bullets, hit the Home Depot, and attack the vampire HQ with $59.99 chainsaws. Even better, just flood it using $9.99 garden hoses. Worth seeing for a number of laughable sequences, including one in which Beckinsale expends about 1,100 rounds from two handheld automatic pistols to create a Looney Tunes-style hole in the floor to jump down through. (I can suspend my disbelief of Hollywood clip sizes unless I have a scene like this shoved in my face...); also to hear grown people discuss the Lycans in abject fear, although if you're just sitting down to this movie with a bowl of popcorn, you might, like me, hear 'lichens' in your head.

But fate is not always kind, and sometimes takes us on a very difficult path.  As luck would have it, Selene falls in love with a handsome Werewolf.
This is not your typical, gothic Vampire flick.  The Vampires and Werewolves in Underworld make good use of human technology to help them in their quest to annihilate one another.  This movie is similar to your common action film in that it is full of high tech firearms, computers, hip clothes, and fancy cars.  But it differs in that this one actually has an interesting plot.

I am not the biggest ""Underworld"" fan, either, but what this version had to offer seemed intriguing--considerably less so when I watched the actual film.  The recut/new scenes are mostly pointless filler, adding additional weight to an already heavy film, and do nothing to further develop characters or enrich the plot.  ""Underworld"" plays best as a guilty-pleasure in the vein of ""Ghosts of Mars""--put your logic on the back burner for a few hours and just obliterate your senses with some art-directed action.

1947550,4,B0000UI2NM,"The first thing I must say, flat out is : It's about time / Great concept for an action movie!  Even as a kid, I had to wonder if vampires and the mythical werewolves ever had ... problems with each other.  It's an age old thing, really.  Vampires symbolize ageless, immortal power, sensuality, and dark gracefulness.  They are that element of human nature that is dark refinement, ageless refined, sexually eloquent power.  The werewolf is pure, insane, beastful rage released.  It is that element of human nature that symbolizes rage, brutality, enforcement - aggression and violence.  So it's very cool to have a movie playing off the symbolic equivalents of the differing psychologies of the audience members.  Some people in the audience for this movie are obviously vampiric, others show a wolfish element.
It's a great ride, too, with very Matrix-esque action sequences that pull you along at great speed, catapulting you into this ""underground"" world.
My one complaint was that the ""wolves"" are not very... well, wolfish.  They are more like deformed mutants, really!  I was very let down with that, since I was expecting a full, head on contest between real werewolves and vampires.  It's more akin to say that this movie is like the vampires versus the weird mutated humans who don't look wolfish at all.  The sad part is I've seen humans that DO look like wolves (A ""wolfish"" grin, etc.) so I think they could've done better.
Still, it sure is fun, and a good action ride!  At least they have the vampires right.

1947551,3,B0000UI2NM,"When I saw the movie poster a couple weeks before Underworld came out I knew I would like it, but I never had the opportunity to see it in theaters.  Instead I had to wait to see it on video at a party and it was everything I had expected it to be, soaked in atmosphere and loud.  Action packed?  Yes.  Romantic? No.  Don't expect it to be a retelling of Romeo and Juliet, although the general elements are there.
As the movie opens we are told that Vampires and Werewolves have been at war with each other for 'the better part of a thousand years.'  And to illustrate that point the Vampires and Werewolves battle out in a subway station for the first twenty or so minutes.  The only surviving Vampire from this encounter, Selene, discovers a den of werewolves hidden beneath the city. and with that discovery she also uncovers a conspiracy between the vampire leader, Kraven, and the werewolf leader, Lucian, that involves a human named Michael, who is due to show his true nature at the next full moon. Fearing that Kraven's actions may place the vampires in jeopardy, Selene does the unthinkable - bypassing protocol, she awakens the ancient vampire noble, Viktor, from a mummified coma, so he can stop Kraven.
The strengths of the movie lie in its visuals.  The costumes, the sets, the action, they all rock.  Since the action sequences take place in the first and last quarters these are the most involving parts of the movie.  When the action transpires through dialogue the movie slows down, although what is left of the visuals definitely keeps the movie interesting to watch.  The acting is virtually non-existant.  Everyone is playing types so it isn't hard to pull off.  The only one who is annoying to watch is Kraven, who twists his face a few times too often.  Kate Beckinsale will probably find more than one fan with her appearance in 'the body condom.'  As for the chemistry between the characters?  Well, like I said, its not a romance, but they still manage to fit in a kiss that makes absolutely no sense.
Well, some people like me will be obsessed with the movie, trying to suck every detail out of everything.  As a work of art it isn't a masterpiece but it is definitely entertaining.",1089158400,,2208,4.591836734693878

The premise is actually interesting: Vampire and Werewolves are not friendly with each other.  This movie suggests that it's a conflict dating back centuries.  Okay, I'm willing to buy that, as long as the dialogue and characters aren't culled from a horror-genre parts bin.  Give me something hand made!
Selene is a vampire, trained to hunt and kill the lycans (werewolves, why not just call them that?).  Then one day she hunts down a lycan she happens to fall in love with.  Ah, is that a wiff of Romeo and Juliet I smell?  No.  Nothing of interest happens there; they talk about a lot of stuff, none of it very exciting.  There are some people in long, flowing leather jackets waking through double-doors over and over and over again in slow-mo.  Whoa!  Then there's some Matrix-esque stuff that doesn't resemble the Matrix.  In the end, she kills the head lycan dude, just like in a video game, by cutting him in half with a ninja sword, he takes forever to actually sever in half and die, and the whole Women's Liberation movement takes one step backwards as Kate Beckinsale tries to look murderous.
It's a pity we've reached a point where our ""subculture genre"" is becoming infused with mainstream trappings.  I suppose it's analogous to Metallica's ""Black Album,"" but really it's more to do with the marketing to youngsters who imagine themselves on the fringes of ""the norm"" as we used to call it and dress like they're different and shunned.

THE CONS
---------
Both the vampires and lycans seemed too human and not power enough.  The vampires don't seem to be able to fly or move very quickly or see in the dark.  The lycans seem to be more dangerous as humans than as wolves.  Both seem to need guns and special bullets to get by.
Neither genre seemed to carry the usual atmosphere.  Vampires are usually erotic while werewolves are usually portrayed as chaotic.
The film has so many twists and turns that in the end I didn't really care who lived and who died (except I did care about the human).
PROS
----
The dark sinister atmosphere of the photography is downright creepy.
I quickly stopped viewing this as a horror film and began seeing it as a ""who done it"".  It is a good ""who done it"".  It had me playing mental games as I watched each twist and turn.
The film had enough action to keep me intertained.

1947560,3,B0000UI2NM,"Underworld is a hit-and-miss affair. For the kind of audience likely to be interested in a vamps vs. werewolves gorefest, one of the big pluses is Kate Beckinsale in skintight leather. Hell, that's a plus for any movie. The plot is not as incoherent as some of the genre; in fact, it's pretty standard stuff. An ancient war has raged between vamps and wolfboys (there are apparently no were-women), with roots going back centuries. Both vamps and wolves have apparently shed their unorganized and high-profile terrorizing and human-eating in favor of secret and well-funded organizations hidden from human view, complete with high-tech weapons and scientific research labs. In this pic, the lovely and smoothly efficient werewolf-killing vampire Selene (Kate B.) stumbles across a plot by werewolves to capture a human for purposes unknown. She tracks him down, saves him from werewolves, is saved in turn by him, and falls for him even after learning that he is soon to become a werewolf--a liaison strictly forbidden by the vampire code (and probably John Ashcroft's). Secret plots and ancient betrayals are revealed, Celine's vampire 'coven' is revealed to be led by a power-hungry traitor, and she awakens the dormant master vampire to help deal with the situation--with unintended but hardly surprising consequences. So far so good--you weren't expecting Bergman-esque psychological depth, were you?
So much for the outline--I yawned just writing it. What makes or breaks a picture like this is its ability to draw you in and excite you, and Underworld fails, but not by too much. Kate Beckinsale is pretty and intense, but hardly menacing, and not really even sexy. One of the main problems throughout is the vampires' lack of cool. In good vampire movies and books, such as the Anne Rice examples, vampires are enthralling because of the nightmarish contrast between their godlike powers and their savage bestialty. Those vampires both glory in and are damned by their immortality and powers; they are giants among ants yet forever doomed to exist apart from the real world. They cannot change or grow, and all their power is undercut by their need to kill eternally and live in darkness. Such vampires can fly, mezmerize people, turns into mists, scale walls, disappear into shadows, and survive anything but the sun, stakes, and beheading.
The vampires in Underworld are unfortunately more like those on Buffy the Vampire Slayer--minus the leering. Their mansion is decorated in the standard red-velvet-and-burled-walnut, and they seem to spend a lot of time sitting around in New Romantic fluffy shirts and leather bodices drinking a red liquid from crystal goblets (scary!!). Even though the 'coven' is described as decadent, there is not a single demented orgy or blood-spraying group feast; in fact no vampire in the whole movie comes close to, or even seems to feel the desire for, biting a human neck. When they fight the werewolves they use machine guns and grenades. Kate does a few standard slo-mo leaps to escape danger and such, but the action sequences are fairly humdrum, definitely not up to the standard of the Blade movies. Of course Kate is no action star, but could someone find a stunt double and throw in some CGI? In one of the climactic scenes her group of vampires clashes with some werewolves, and the scene is basically Kate standing still and shooting four wolves in turn. Oooh, wow. Selene, who is supposed to be an elite hunter-killer vamp, clomps through fights on platform boots and wheezes loud enough for the local rent-a-cops to hear. More dumb violatons of the vampire standard: in one scene a vampire admires herself in a mirror--a mirror!!--and then in what is probably the worst example, Kate is 'saved' from death by being dragged out of a submerged car. Umm, I didn't know drowning was a way to kill vampires....
Vampires, when presented properly, are very cool and menacing (I've never been at all interested in werewolves, but that's just me), but Underworld instead mostly gives us some dandies running around with guns. It's not unwatchable, but the payoff is not nearly as good as the setup, because it misses so many obvious opportunities to be better.",1088121600,2,4206,5.035868005738881

Maybe the problem lies with the fact that the premise is so promising... a centuries old blood-feud between lycanthropes and vampires. Had the underlying concept been weaker maybe it wouldn't be so disapointing. But alas, when you make big promises you have to follow through with a big delivery... something this film just could not do.
The fact that these unique, legendary creatures would have to resort to a non-stop gun battle is a trite cop-out and it just never lets up. UW never fully takes advantage of the inherent abilities of the monsters themselves and makes them just glorified mortal humans. The plot twists provide nothing to get excited about. Like a few others I had to try for several weeks before I actually made it all the way through. Just boring really and unoriginal while it could have been so much more.",1087776000,3,971,4.785714285714286

But I have to admit, I loved this movie.  I loved the dark world setting, the powerful music, the movie's pacing, and the plot twists at the end.  Having said that, I did have to adjust to this new vampire and werewolf universe that the director and his team had created.  Werewolves running along the walls and being easily killed by vampires - not too believable.  The bullets of silver nitrate and sunlight were.  I thought Seline as the conflicted werewolf hunter was very believable.  However, our doctor hero seemed a wimpy hostage until he went through the transformation at the end.  If you love the commentary on the original DVD, then stay with that one.  If you are a DVD collector and want to have the entire series (Underworld: Evolution is due out January 2006), then get the unrated new version, too.

1947565,2,B0000UI2NM,"When Underworld was first marketed before it hit theaters, it marketed as a Romeo & Juliet-esque love story involving werewolves and vampires.  Instead, from the first frame on, we are thrown head first into a derivative hyrbid of Blade, The Matrix, The Crow, and every goth kid's comic book fantasy (which isn't a bad thing, but it doesn't work here).  A war between the vamps and werewolves and raged on for over a thousand years, and it comes to a head when a skin tight leather clad ""death dealing"" vampire (Kate Beckinsale) finds herself in the middle of a conspiracy involving a young doctor (Scott Speedman), and plot twists and turns are about.  Where Underworld could have succeeded, it fails almost miserably.  The action scenes are overdone yet unimpressive, the cast is bland and there is overacting aplenty, and where the story could have been something really special (the aforementioned Romeo & Juliet-esque love story) is what is most disappointing of all.  The film is now one of the newest ""bonus filled"" overpriced DVD's to be released of late (check out the Texas Chainsaw Massacre Platinum Series DVD and the Mystic River 3 disc DVD set), but the new material adds nothing to the film.  It's worth checking out for some, but better left on the shelf.",1087603200,2,1271,4.8341013824884795

It's also obvious that if it wasn't for Blade, I'd have a real problem with vampires and werewolves using guns.  I surprisingly didn't think it was a big deal seeing gunbattles between mythological creatures.  Hell, why not.
So, it's vampires versus werewolves in an ultra-gothic cityscape were a petite Kate Bekinsale plays a 'Death Dealer'; essentially a werewolf hunter.  Uncovering a nefarious werewolf plot centered around an oblivious Scott Speedman and an apparent vampire traitor, the Death Dealer attempts to uncover the truth behind her tragic past and the fate of the two species.
The Werewolves:  What can I say?  The werewolves were the best part of this film.  Not only do they live underground (...), but they also have the ability to change into their wolf form at will.  No freakin' out at the full moon, here.  They also came across like true warriors fighting for their own personal honor.  I also liked the twist surrounding the Lycan leader that sort of balanced both sides.
The Vampires:  You know, I kind of laugh when I think about the motives behind the filmakers regarding how they handled the vampires.  In MY opinion, this movies actually TRIES to make fun of vampires and the whole neo-gothic subculture in general.  Think about it.  What did you see everytime Beckinsale's character stormed into Vampire HQ?  A bunch of guys just lounging around drinking wine and trying to 'out-attitude' everyone else.  In fact, most of the vampires came off as total wankers.  This theory was further confirmed when Viktor was 'awakened'.  This ancient vampire king was a total bad(...).  And he just looks around at his descendents like they're the biggest lot of sissies he's ever seen.  He didn't seem too happy with the current state of modern vampirism.  One of my favorite scenes was when he took on a Lycan bare-handed showing the sissie-vamps how a werewolf is to be dealt with.
Underworld makes a strong attempt at neo-noir but falls short in its reliance on pointless action and an even more pointless love interest.  However, there are many redeeming points that beg another viewing.  Check it out.",1087603200,,2196,4.907608695652174

You actually get background for the characters in this movie, not all of it, but enough to tantalize you and make the second installment a must see!  This is not your typical vampire/werewolf movie, it totally raises the bar.  To give you a quick rundown of the story line, vampires and werewolves have been fighting for centuries.  Only now, they use modern day equipment and modern weapons, like guns to fight eachother.  One werewolf decides that he wants to create a sort of hybrid half vampire half werewolf, but stronger than both.  I won't say any more, but sufice to say, it is an action packed thriller of a movie, with an ending that leaves you begging for the next movie to get here!  I have watched this movie a dozen times over, and I am still not tired of it.

1947568,2,B0000UI2NM,"The two stars are only for the recently released Unrated Extended Version - not the original DVD. The original DVD is definitely ***** stars for me. Like a lot of people, if I really like a movie, I'll buy the Unrated Director's Cut because of all the extras. But in this case, the original is much better than the new version.
Let's compare. The first DVD has a great commentary by Len Wiseman (director), Danny McBride (screenplay), and Kevin Grevioux (storyline - he is also the huge Black guy with the incredible voice who plays a Lycan). They talk about how the three of them came up with the idea for this movie and how it got made. They also talk about how some of the scenes were done, information on the cast, the conditions under which they made the movie - no budget, major time constraints - and what it was like filming in Budapest, Hungary. It also has a technical commentary that I haven't listened to yet. On the other hand, the commentary for the extended cut is done by the director, Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman. This commentary's main subject was talking about Beckinsale's hair, compliments for Beckinsale by Wiseman (who is Beckinsale's husband or partner) and Speedman, teasing Speedman, and gushing over Michael Sheen (who was great as Lucien). There are no technical discussions and the only other cast member who is talked about for any length of time was Bill Nighy (Viktor, who was excellent). Half way through the commentary, Speedman leaves and then there's a bunch of chit chat between Wiseman and Beckensale about Speedman going off to make a movie with the Olson twins.
Wiseman also states a couple of times that this version is not a director's cut (are they going to release another DVD?). When he talks about added scenes, he points out which scenes he would have liked in the original theatrical release and the first DVD, and which scenes he wouldn't like to see back in the movie. If he didn't want certain scenes added then why are they in the extended cut? This newer version adds a scene where Michael (Speedman) talks about his past and how he ended up in Budapest, a storyline that adds a love affair between Erika and Craven, plus some added shots of Viktor with the apparatus that pumps blood into him. But there are also numerous and completely unnecesarry scenes of Lycans and Vampires going up and down stairways over and over, and just little shots of objects that are part of the set. In addition, there's absolutely NO reason to title this DVD as unrated, which implies that there are scenes that were deleted because of problems with the MPAA rating. I don't see how any of the added scenes could have pushed the MPAA to make this movie NC-17. I think that was just another ploy to get people to fork over more money for this version.
The only thing that I liked in the extended cut were some outtakes. But there weren't enough of them to make up for the additional money you'd have to pay for this cut.
To sum up, if you're a film geek who loves to listen to commentaries on the DVD, stick with the original DVD. If you don't care about that kind of stuff and you don't already own the original DVD, then it's up to you if you want to sit through a lot of unnecassary additons that the director didn't even like. But if you already have the first DVD, I would not recommend buying this version (unless you're dying to listen to Beckinsale complain endlessly about her hair).
The Extended Cut is NOT a director's cut - it just has extra scenes in it. Some of the scenes the director wanted in the movie and some of the scenes he didn't. How do I know this? - from listening to the commentary",1087430400,9,3650,4.515105740181269

I never want to hear this in the same sentence as Interview With a Vampire quite simply because Underworld has nothing to do with Vampires. It simply uses them to make a group oppose the warewolves. Kate or 'Selene' actually passes out from lack of blood (funny considering she's supposedly dead), when the light in the mansion goes out, the 'vampires' actually need to carry torches in order to see. And lastly, I've never met a vampire that can;t hear trains in a tunnel before.

And the plot is involved. The script it's very weak and Kate Beckinsale doesn't look like a vampire, in fact, the vampires are the less resemblance to a vampire.",1086566400,2,325,4.620689655172414
1947572,3,B0000UI2NM,"A woman in paramilitary garb stands over a kneeling male prisoner.  She's a soldier whose nation is threatened by the prisoner's allies.  He has information about an attack his people are planning against her more technologically and economically advanced society.  The soldier's commander needs her to ""soften up"" the prisoner so they can find out the details of the attack.
The prisoner knows he is going to die in this interrogation cell, but he doesn't mind, because his people's uprising will bring down the ""superpower"" of his supposedly more civilized captors.
The prisoner refuses to talk.  So this soldier, who has always thought of herself as the protector of her people, tortures him.  Without a moment's hesitation.  She repeatedly twists the prisoner's wounded shoulder until the pain makes him talk.
This isn't a digital movie from a prison in Iraq, it's the horror film Underworld.  The soldier is Selene, a vampiric ""death-dealer"" torturing a Lycan (werewolf) prisoner.  The vampires and Lycans have been fighting for centuries and now use guns that shoot deadly silver and ultraviolet light (sunlight) at each other.
Watching Underworld proves one thing - -  what's going on in the world at the time you see a movie determines what you see in it.
Underworld is more interesting than I thought it would be.  For one thing, the special effects and makeup are more believable than the cartoonish CGI in movies like The Hulk, Spider-Man, and Van Helsing.  (Speaking of Van Helsing, Kate Beckinsale should take a break from vampire movies.  She's a very good actor.  See Laurel Canyon and Cold Comfort Farm.)
After the vampires' equivalent of James Bond's Q designs the gun that shoots molten silver to use against the werewolves, Selene practices with it by shooting busts of William Shakespeare at the firing range.  As the liquid silver flows down Shakespeare's cheek, it looks like he's crying.
The film might be saying that this decadent vampire society, which sees itself as more intellectual, more cultured, more ""human"" than the sewer-dwelling Lycans, has rejected  everything that makes civilization (and therefore themselves) worth preserving.  Or the film might be saying ""Old Europe"" and its culture aren't relevant any more - - bring on the guns and Armageddon.  Or it might be that the screenwriter was forced to take a boring Shakespeare class in high school and this is his revenge.
It doesn't matter what the makers of Underworld and a lot of other movies in the last decade meant to say.  What they have said to a generation is that previously accepted rules of behavior are ""inoperative"" if they inconvenience us.  Individuals have always tortured and committed atrocities.  But if atrocity is condoned by our leaders, supposedly in a good cause, the world will turn (as Anthony Burgess warned us) quite horrorshow.",1086566400,6,2846,5.0665236051502145

I spent $25 more dollars expecting all kinds of additional footage that would give more story line and more plot twists and more action...AT LEAST 24 MINUTES OF EXTRA MOVIE, according to a sticker on the front cover. To quote the back cover, ""...the battle for supremacy never before seen by human eyes, until now!"". WELL, I'VE PUT BOTH MOVIES IN AND CONCLUDED THERE'S ROUGHLY 8 MINUTES OF ADDITIONAL FOOTAGE, NEVER BEFORE SEEN BY HUMANS EYES, NOT 24 MINUTES OF THE BATTLE FOR SUPREMACY NEVER BEFORE SEEN BEFORE HUMAN EYES!!!

I believe an explination is in order.
However, I love the extras on the uncut 2 disc version, there is much more of that. Great job there. The case has a very neat 2 cover artwork trick. The 2 booklets are pretty cool, too, but none of that is the main reason I forked over $25 more bucks.
In final...I guess my main complaint is the FALSE ADVERTISMENT of the additional 24 minutes! I still give it 5 stars, but I'm writing this review as a heads up for those who are looking for alot more in the actual movie itself, it's just not there.",1086480000,,1163,4.596153846153846
1947574,4,B0000UI2NM,"When I first viewed ""Underworld"" I very much enjoyed it.
It's been one of the most impressive Vampire and Werewolf movies to come out in recent years, and despite it's meager budget easily puts the more recently released ""Van Helsing"" to shame.
But there were problems and I made full note of them.
Kate Beckinsale(Selene)'s performance is nearly withought flaw and almost carries the entire film, and along with being a talented actress she puts nearly ever other female action star to shame with how she handles herself.  Michael Sheen(Lucian) and Bill Nigh(Viktor) also make their characters very believable.  And the majority of the supporting cast is actually quite good, however, certain actors like Shane Brolly(Kraven) and Scott Speedman(Michael Corvin) delivered less than satisfactory performances.  Brolly, do to the fact that he didn't play an extremely large part isn't such an annoyance, or rather he's a good anoyance since he plays the jerk off you love to hate.  So he could be overlooked.  Speedman However was one of the flaws which I maleciously attacked during my first review.
Although this movie is certainly action packed, with a dark and gothic setting, it also has the undertones of a love story.  But in the original release I just couldn't see any real chemistry between Selene and Michael.  As much as I tried I just couldn't see any reason why Selene, a warrior with a vendetta against the entire werewolf race, would fall for him!  But in this Extended Cut all that is different.  Speedman's best scene was completely cut from the film.  In it he gives his back story and for the first time I actually started to like his character, and more importantly I actually found myself understanding their relationship!  Trust me, if you were a critic of the love plot like I was this is for you.
It still doesn't get five stars because I still didn't like how it ended.  I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it, but the film really just looses it's focus in the last fifteen minutes or so.  It's still a definate buy though and I'm eagerly awaiting the sequal.",1086220800,2,2091,4.79108635097493
1947575,5,B0000UI2NM,"I love ""Underworld""! I saw it in the movie theater when it first came out, then bought the dvd and novelization and just recently purchased the new unrated extended cut dvd.
The extended cut has some new added/recut scenes and, although I would've loved for it to be longer, I felt that it did add more dimension to some of the characters. Some of the new scenes include more backstory on Michael Corvin, a love scene between Kraven and Erika and an extended battle at the finale. The scene after Selene's car fell in the river has been recut and there are some minor additions that are barely noticeable (unless you've seen the theatrical cut a few times).
The new special features are also a big plus. I enjoyed ""Fang vs. Fiction"" and the entertaining commentary by director Len Wiseman, Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman, to name a few.
I have already posted a longer review on the theatrical cut dvd and it goes without saying that I enjoy this film immensely. It's simply the kind of action film that you could watch over and over again.
Kate Beckinsale as Selene is simply mesmerizing. Who would've thought that the young British actress who started out in costume dramas/comedies like the BBC's ""Emma"" and ""Cold Comfort Farm"" could successfully transform herself into a credible action heroine.  The rest of the cast is also outstanding and the story is completely engrossing.
I would recommend this extended cut dvd to fans of ""Underworld"" particularly if they already do not have the original theatrical cut.  I can't wait for the sequel to come out......",1086134400,,1565,4.792592592592593
1947576,3,B0000UI2NM,"I know the title might be a bit redundant, most vampire movies inolve a little bit of eye candy.  Even both of the Vampires movies had attractive characters even if only a few.  But the makers of this film make it their primary focus.
The acting is for the most part cheesy or bad, the actors are good looking, the plot has truck sized holes, and the it all has a slick and stylized look.
But I am not saying that it is bad, it is a fun action flick.
It is all based off an age old war between the werewolves and the vampires.  Years ago the werewolves were slaves to the vampires, but by their legends they broke free and a war started.  Now they are both out for the extinction of their enemy.  The Lycans(werewolves), are losing the war, the werewolves are getting desperate because they know they are losing and face being wiped out by their former masters.  so they are looking for a solution in the form of an individual, the decendent of some special individual.  Kate Beckinsale is a vampire assasin(death dealer), who is caught up in the political machinations of her family.
The movie has some good if improbable action sequences.  I often wondered how many bullets her gun was capable of holding.  The costumes and the sets were spectacular.  The characters were pretty and looked the roles that they were assigned.
The bad was primarily the acting.  A few of the actors were flat out terrible.  Beckinsale looks right for the role, but that is where it ends.  She seems unenthusiastic in her delivery, making her character wooden.  The plot might make sense to hardcore sci fi fans or gamers, but a lot is left either poorly explained or not explained at all.  I remember there being a lot of debate over it on the message boards.
Three stars for the production quality but lopsided final project.  To my understanding there is a sequel planned, hopefully they will work on the acting and writing.  Either way, I'll be there for the spectacle alone.",1086134400,,1961,4.5413105413105415

So I picked up the extended cut.  Blah. It didn't fix any of the problems. There is nothing on the disc (for the film) that isn't included in the novelization (which was, sad to say, poorly written).  If you've read it, you don't need to see the extended cut.

Was it because Vampires needed the ""eyes"" in the daylight, the know where's and the how to's. I'm sorry, but I always thought that Werewolves were much stronger than Vampires (OH NO, I might have said something bad there)They had the change and opportunity to kill their 'masters' but no, those werewolves (sigh) they listened and did all the wrong doings for those vampires, but what! 'Underworld' is not that kind of movie at all.
So, what the movie is trying to say (I'm being sarcastic here) is that with the blood of a Wolf and a Vamp you can get something stronger thus ending the fued and gaining the respect between the two? I can buy that...
 So Kate Beckinsale interested in action/horror movies are you? Well good for you, (saw you in Van Hesling,) very good acting. Your character? Very believable worked for me here in this movie and their in that movie.

There were three scenes or so that I noticed were different, but they didn't really ad much of anything.  Honestly I can't see how they cut this down to the regular version and felt both deserved to be released.  It amounts to pretty much the same thing as those two versions of Highlander 4 - ie, a little different, but in the end the same thing.
It was longer, I noticed that.  But there were no major additions like the long versions of, say, The Abyss, T2, Waterworld, Lawnmower Man, Joy Ride, Aliens, etc.  Now those were some serious extended cuts that added major subplots or entirely different story lines.  The regular version is simply a finely trimmed down version of this one.  Dissapointing.
But the package is way cool.  So are the two books that come with it.  But really, if they wanted to mess with this, it should have been a single package with the first movie.
And the Fangs vs Fiction ""documentary"" is just silly and missleading.  It's just an elaborate promo for the movie.  For one thing, the word ""lycan"" was introduced by... Underworld!  Yet they try and pass it off like real terminology.  Secondly, many of the werewolf history details are wrong, like junk about full moons and silver bullets (both of which are 20th century concepts).
Like most DVDs, the seperate featuretes repeat lots of stuff and could have easily been edited into one longer feature. And it's only got one of the two trailers for the movie.

I mean a human that was just turned werewolf fighting an ancient vampire and kicking his anus all over the place is just too much. So what if he was both vampire and werewolf. The vampires in this movie aint worth shiat so he didn't get much power from them. And whats up with vampires and werewolves using weapons. I can understand swords and stuff but not guns. I have to say though that the only thing good about this movie was the story line. And there was so many suck-points about this movie that the story line sucked.

It wants to be _The Crow_. It wants to be _The Matrix_. It wants to be _Blade_. It wants to be _Dark City_. It wants to be _Lara Croft: Tomb Raider_. It wants to be the Next Great Vampire/Werewolf Movie. And it isn't any of them.
What it _is_ is a pretty good (and fairly novel) film in the gothic-horror genre. But that's all it is.
The idea here is a perfectly good one. Kate Beckinsale is Selene, a vampire who hunts 'Lycans' (werewolves, from 'lycanthropes'). Apparently there's been a war between these two species for lots of centuries, and there's a human being (Scott Speedman) who has something or other to do with a recent burst of Lycan activity.
The whole thing is fairly well handled (including the special effects), and it's at least fun to watch even if the characters are rather one-dimensional. If you want to see a sorta-PoMo/SF-inflected leather-and-guns goth wetdream, this is a good choice. It even bears up pretty well under repeated viewing.
But you'll be disappointed if you expect it to be everything it's been billed as. It ain't. The look is excellent and the production values are high, but it's mostly surface gloss: there is, let's say, a high style-to-substance ratio.",1085702400,3,1267,4.660714285714286

But I digress, this ""added footage"" that they are making a great stink over is not even noticeable, there were times when I thought something looked a bit different, like a camera angle, or the way lines were delivered, but it was vaguely noticeable and easily forgotten about within two minutes.  There is no added footage here that enriches the plot, deepens the story, high ten's the senses or just plain makes you go ""WOW"".  The footage, in fact, is so unnoticeable I honestly thought there was a 14min epilogue added, and I kept checking the counter on my DVD player to see if the movie was indeed any longer.  The bottom line, if you own this movie already, don't buy it again, if you don't own it, buy the cheaper version if you must have it, because you wouldn't notice a thing different between the two, and lastly (for you movie directors/ producers / or studio executives) if you intend on releasing a movie on DVD and then almost a year later re-release it because you've added or reworked footage, make damn sure it's noticeable and stop wasting our(the consumer's) time and money.",1085616000,10,1533,4.56

You may have heard it said that all the creator did was splice 'the Matrix' and 'Blade' together, and while i can see why people would think that, the result is, in some ways, greater than the sum of its parts. The characters are good and authentic (thanks to good acting), the story is good, the action is great. What's even better: the last scene all but puts up a neon sign saying ""SEQUEL"". Yay!

My hopes were not in vain on this one.  Underworld is easily one of my favorites of all time.  Despite a limited budget ($30 mil) and the daunting task of cramming a thousand years of vampire/werewolf history into two hours, Wiseman and company still managed to make it believable and interesting.  Underworld could follow in the footsteps of other small budget fantasy/sci-fi flicks that went on to become great franchises, so to speak, such as The Matrix ($63 mil), Highlander, and the grandaddy of them all Star Wars ($11 mil).  Anyway, if you're a fan of vampires, werewolves, monsters, or Kate Beckinsale, I highly recommend this movie to you.  And if you're not a fan of Kate Beckinsale, you should be.",1085270400,,949,4.75

Although i DO have to agree with another person that reviewed this newer ""unrated/extended cut"" edition.  I HAAATE when they do this to us (the movie lovers).  Although ill probably ""whore-out"" and buy this version also. I still think that it is unfair for the company to hold off on ""extras"" of a movie to be re-released at a later date.  That is totally unfair to us the consumers and proves how much money is the almighty ruler to them!!!  I say that the people who bought this dvd should be able to ""trade it in"" for the newer version or at least get an extra discount when purchasing this newer version. that would be fair to me, i think.  like maybe 2 buxx or something.  but other than that.

Also, IMHO, they made the vampires way too wimpy.  In one scene, Selen and another guy get into a car accident and he has to revive her...WTF?  Not what I would have expected for the ""masters"" of the Lycans.
The only vampire that kicked butt was the ancient one, all of the ""modern"" ones sucked.
I'm also PO'd of the practice of release, then re-release of DVD's.  As such, I've now adopted the practice of waiting several months before adding to my collection.  DON'T support this and keep buying both versions.

1947599,5,B0000UI2NM,"Blade was interesting, but to me it failed emotionally.  You just do not connect with the film on the personal level.  The effects were super, but that was the main impact...""wow what amazing effects"".  You feel like breaking out in a chorus of Peggy Lee's Is That All There Is.  Special effects alone cannot make a movie great.
Underworld makes that jump, great FX work, but also gives you characters you really care about, ones that you really love to hate.  A strong plot line designed to hook you and keep you, just does that.  With the emotional involvement, there is a greater impact, a movie that will demand repeat viewing.  Instant Cult Status.
The movie grabs you from the opening and never lets up with the pace.  Firm direction and with a driving score, the movie reaches for perfection.  You have a 1000-year-old war between Lycons and Vampires, and it's all coming to a head.  It's a well thought out and executed premise and Kate Beckinsale shines!  She is an amazing talent.  I first adored her work in Cold Comfort Farm as Robert Post's child Flora.  When you compare that gentle, deft bit of humor with this kick a*** vampire hunter, it proves what an overlooked talent she is.  With Van Helsing out now (and I am sure this movie led to her landing the role), she is finally getting a spotlight she so well deserves.
A gloomy, atmospheric ambiance to the whole movie is maintained all the way through, adding a strong foundation for the otherworld premise.  I am sure some will nitpick things, as all vampire film faces, but kudos for the vibrant energy and sheer edgy feel to the film.
It leaves you hanging, clearly open for a sequel...one can but hope it maintains this high quality.

1947600,1,B0000UI2NM,"You ever sit and wonder how crap like this can get made & pass for entertainment?
If you took the movies ""Blade"", and any vampire or werewolf movie from the past and had it hump ""The Matrix"", ""Underworld"" is its painful offspring.
The film is basically about a centuries old feud between vampires and werewolves. Selene, a vampiress, is a member of the ""death dealers"" (trust me, after watching this celluloid fart, you'd wish you were dead) soldiers who fight the fight against the werewolves. She becomes intrigued & falls in love with a male human, when she comes across Michael, trying to aid one of the wounded werewolves. Unfortunately, Mikey gets bitten and its only a matter time before he has a serious pubic hair problem, at the light of the next full moon. If Selene bites Michael, there may be a cure but its in the form of eternal damnation as a vampire/werewolf half breed (maybe Harry Potter can help?).
There's also a bunch of pointless plot-cockblocking about the sqwabbling between both families. The atmosphere to the film is set in modernday but comes across as if its in late thirties Germany (at one point, I was waiting for Mike Meyers' ""Saturday Night Live"" character Dieter to show up. ""Touch my monkey!""). The characters aren't very interesting, and most of them are in a tense bitchy mood thru out the course of the film. Kate Beckinsale tries to hard to be the hero and is more annoying than the rest of the cast (I hated her ""I'm doing the right thing"" type of attitude). She does look hot in the circulation stopping, skin tight leather outfit she wears. Thats pretty much how I got thru this movie. What really sucks about ""Underworld"" is ""The Matrix"" inspired crap that unveils thruout the film (including the ten story drop to the ground Beckinsale does at the beginning of the film. When I saw that I knew I was in trouble). The film did enough money at the box-office to make a sequel, but if you see ""Underworld"" you would wish it was the end of the world. When I die I'm asking God for the 2hrs. and 15 mins. back I spent watching this 2 dimentional poop. It ain't worth it, people, no matter what other reviewers say. Trust me.

Really, I had to work up the courage to watch this one. Blatantly, it was a waste of courage. I should have listened to my inner monolgoue and gone with my gut. This movie STINKS. There was no dialogue. You could easily go ten minutes without a single word being spoken which was fine considering the caliber of the actors, but when they *did* finally speak, it was completely predictable. I had delivered the line on the couch 30 seconds before it was spoken on screen. That is not a good sign, my friends.

The filmmakers were too ambitious in my opinion, if they had worked with about $20 million more in the budget it might have been worth seeing. The only good thing about this movie was the cinematography, which was very cool, including some very nice use of filters creating a dark but polished look---think matrix.

Then they made the grave mistake of making the movie that they made.  The end result is an uneven, oh-so-serious poseur of an action/horror film that brings in every already-worn-to-death cliche in the book, and then waters it down in order to make it less interesting.  Being the most forgiving kind of horror movie fan, I can enjoy a flawed genre picture if it gives the impression of love for its subject or respect for its audience.  UNDERWORLD gave me the impression of a movie made on a cash register, throwing every market-tested rerun at me for two hours in its safe ploy to rake in piles of cash.  Movies like this display nothing but contempt for their audience (or at best, apathy) and perpetuate the common Hollywood conceit that movie-going audiences aren't intelligent, and are money-spewing fodder for loud, explosive, flashy light shows.  Fine, if you and yours are comfortable with being fed non-creative swill by condescending schmucks in suits that think you're brainless cattle, then continue to support tripe movies like this, and then go watch the E! channel celebrity news and tell all your friends how poignant and insightful and discussion-worthy it all is.
Supporting giant-budget mediocrities like UNDERWORLD--and touting them as anything resembling refreshing or creative--is a sure way to guarantee the future of films will bring us instant preview-test-audience classics like TOP GUN 2, PRETTY WOMAN 5, and MORE FASTER AND MOST FURIOUSEST.
I'm not saying that every movie has to be perfect to be enjoyed, but have a little respect for your audience, filmmakers.  And audiences, try having a little respect for yourself and not gobble up every loud light show the studios tell you you should like.  If that's all you require, just go buy a bunch of bottle rockets and spend some time outdoors...it's less expensive to you, and your money won't line the pockets of those who see you as mindless cattle with wallets.

Vampires and werewolves have been fighting a war for as long as anyone can remember, in modern times, it basically translates to gang like battles over turf.  These battles feature a lot of matrix-like (more like matrix-copied) action sequences, and a whole lot of guns, guns equipped with magic sunlight bullets.  The main character is what's known as a death dealer, not sure what puts her above the rest of her clan, since they all seem quite capable of dealing death, but hey, the title is gothy and sounds cool, so we'll keep it.

Okay, sounds kinda neat, kind of a supernatural Romeo and Juliet.  Except no, see, I actually cared a little bit about Romeo and Juliet, and I understood and sypathized with their character flaws.  But these characters, especially our heroine, should be above these things, but of course, you have to have the angsty I love you but shouldn't love you and now I'll betray my family story for unclear reasons.

It had one main thing going for it and that was the storyline of what would happen if a vampire and werewolf mixed together? A supermonster would be created. Half vampire and half werewolf sounds half crazy but very interesting. That is exactly the problem I had with the film. Let me explain as best I can. You see, this movie builds up this ever-impending fight between the vampires, in particular the ancient vampires, and the werewolves. The werewolves are tired of being slaves to the vampires, so they have come together and organized to make a super race of werewolves that can annihilate the vampires. Well, you can't wait to see it happen and then you do but you want more and you get the end of the movie. On top of getting to see the vampire/werewolf hybrid, you get a little disappointed when you see him fight; he's not so mighty is all I'll say.
I want a sequel to this movie. Now I'm not a sequel nut but this movie definitely could use a sequel. I want to know more about the supermonster that was created in the movie.

1947613,2,B0000UI2NM,"Think a film about a war between vampires and werewolves sounds cool?  Think again.
The vampires in UNDERWORLD have no supernatural powers to speak of, beyond the fact that they're immortal and have superhuman strength.  Instead of using stealth, cunning, and teeth they fight with lots and lots of guns.
The werewolves don't fare much better.  In addition to being immortal and having superhuman strength, the werewolves (called ""lycans"" in the film, short for lycanthropes) have the ability to change their form regardless of whether or not the moon is full.  However, the change is little more than cosmetic, as they don't get any stronger.  They grow sharp claws and teeth, but can't hold a gun in wolf form so it's pretty much a wash.  Their preferred method of fighting is - you guessed it - lots and lots of guns (in human form).
So basically UNDERWORLD takes a really cool concept, removes everything cool about it, and gives us a standard issue post-MATRIX shoot-em-up.  Only problem here is we don't know which side to root for as neither side has any agenda regarding the fate of humans - in fact neither side has any use for humans at all (the vampires drink cloned blood in bags, the werewolves just eat whatever).  So although we'd like the protagonists to survive, we couldn't care less about whatever cause they're fighting for, if any.
2 stars for impressive effects and Kate Beckinsale in tight leather.  Other than that this film earns a big SO WHAT?",1082937600,4,1469,4.774703557312253
1947614,2,B0000UI2NM,"There's barely an original moment in Underworld, and sadly those parts that are derived from elsewhere in motion picture history (that is, all of it), are derived without wit or feeling for their antecedents or the genre.
I have a feeling this film would never have been made were it not for the Matrix. It basically is the Matrix, only with werewolves and vamps, and a blue wash over all the cinematography rather than a green one. So we have a hard-arsed chick in a tight patent-leather cat suit toting a sub-machine gun in each hand in a subway station, driving performance sports cars absurdly fast, performing aerial flips and other acrobatics. Only she's a vampire. With a laptop. We have perpetual rain: we have the trademark Wachowski straight-down shot of rain falling away from the camera onto parked cars in a narrow alley. There's a big final punch-up between two indestructible foes in a great big puddle.
But while it rips off the Matrix's visuals, Underworld has neither the wit - the tongue-in-cheek film noir; the fairly well spec'd cod philosophy - nor any of the style: Kate Beckinsale is no Carrie Anne Moss, having about as much sex appeal as a Tupperware lunchbox, and I'm afraid to say the all-important fight choreography *really* blows.
The bits that are original, sadly, tend to foul up the rest of the picture. To wit: pitting the ""lycans"" (nice try, by the way, to make werewolves sound hip. Didn't work) against vampires misses the fundamental point of both genres, which is the need-to-sleep-with-the-light-on-afterwards factor: they're supposed to GET US. And DRINK OUR BLOOD. In Underworld they're knocking six shades of hell out of each other (with guns... GUNS?? VAMPIRES WITH GUNS? What the hell is going on?), so rather than being terrifying, it plays out more like a moodily lit feature-length episode of the World Wrestling Federation. You don't really care who wins as long as there is damn good fight. But, as noted, the fight choreography is Woe Ful than Wo Ping.
There's zero chemistry between any of Michael Sheen, Bill Nighy or the other one and Kate - it's understandable, fellahs; it's hard to love an airtight plastic container.
Sophia Myles plays a decidedly plot-functional blonde vamp-girl who pops up at critical moments to push the narrative along, but doesn't end up having much to do with anything. I think she's rather petulantly sent to her room just before the climax, and you never see her again. Since she was about the most interesting part of the picture, that's a pity. For my money, Myles would have been a better female lead than Beckinsale.
A special ""opportunity knocks"" award should go to Bill Nighy, who's been underachieving in British TV dramas since 1979 or so, never showing up in anything of note, who finally snags a peach of a part in Love Actually, and now you can't get the old buzzard off your screen - a fading rock star there; a sleazy Tory MP in Auf Wiedersehen, Pet; a lecherous 19th Colonel in He Knew He Was Right and a now a thousand year old vampire uber-lord in Underworld, and ALL of them portrayed as exactly the same character! Even Kevin Costner would be impressed with that!
Not sure what he would have made of the rest of the film, however.

1947615,4,B0000UI2NM,"I had low expectations going in to this movie but was pleasantly surprised by how entertaining it was.  What was more surprising was to see how many low ratings this movie has received here at Amazon.

I think part of the backlash is resentment over some overt 'borrowing' of material from other films.  Significant elements of Underworld's storyline have been recycled from Blade II.  The Matrix's influence on the visual style was unmistakeable and--in 2004--no longer looks fresh and original.  What's more, several of the action gags seemed oddly familiar (a leather-clad female diving head first through a tiny window (Matrix).  A bad guy stabbing through a roof with an arm-sword to get the good guys (T2).  Monsters who choose walls and ceilings in lieu of terra firma when traversing a hall (Aliens)).

The underdeveloped love sub-plot didn't work for me either.  In this respect, the storyline was a little too lean and mean for its own good.  If the filmmakers expected the audience to buy off on the romance between the female vampire lead and the human, they needed to lay a better foundation.  In fairness, there were other motivations for her to do some of the things she did, but they didn't justify all of her actions (or risks) absent a romantic interest in the human (which again was underdeveloped).

The creature effects for the werewolves were very good.  The one disappointment was with the hybrid vampire/werewolf.  It was supposed to have been a super monster, but it looked much less menacing than even the standard-issue werewolves.  And while it initially appeared to have physical prowess vastly superior to even the toughest vampire, that misrepresentation was quickly put to rest in the subsequent action.  After the built-up anticipation, the payoff was a bit of a letdown.

Despite the negatives I've just listed, I find myself giving Underworld a thumps-up recommendation.  A tight script yields a film that hits the ground running and pretty much never stops.  If by some chance you've not seen the earlier-referenced films (alien abduction?), you might actually be blown away by this movie.  Regardless, it's worth checking out.  While Underworld may not be ground breaking, the sum of the parts add up to a fun evening in front of the home theater system.  Three-and-a-half stars.",1082678400,2,2316,5.0236220472440944
1947616,2,B0000UI2NM,"This is a film that certainly should stand as an example of ""style over substance.""  All the actors (except Scott Speedman)run around obviously feeling very cool and stylish in their dark costumes, but they forget to invest any real feeling into their performances.
But that isn't entirely their fault.  The idea of a whole separate ""underworld"" co-existing with ours, wherein vampires and lycans battle each other is pretty neat, but it's hard to imagine a movie doing LESS with the concept.  And Kate Beckinsale (a vampire and lycan-hunter extraordinare) and Scott Speedman (bitten by a lycan) are sort-of Romeo and Juliet types, except the actors and the script forgets to inject any actual heat (or hint of believability) into their ""romance.""  We gather that for some reason Beckinsale cares for the milquetoast, slightly seedy looking Speedman, but can't begin to imagine WHY!
Beckinsale looks good in her costume.  She's got a lean body and the right features for the role. But she's really pretty light-weight...and I'm concered that she's becoming a movie action figure, what with a lead role in VAN HELSING (where the previews make it clear she's got a terrible accent!).  I've liked her in many things (LAUREL CANYON, for example) but this project lets her down...and she let's it down too.  Although it's unlikely she could carry it.
The film gets two stars (rather than one) for the costumes and for the great special effects when an ancient vampire (played by Bill Nighy) is brought prematurely back to life.  He puts on layers of himself and we get to see the gory transformation.  Someone put a lot of work into that...too bad the others involved in the film didn't try so hard.
Can't really recommend this one to anyone, but I don't think there are any materials that a kid over 13 can't see.",1082419200,3,1809,4.866449511400652

1947618,3,B0000UI2NM,"I mean the title of this review literally.  I watched it while I was scanning a book for a publisher, and it was a good minor distraction from the mechanical drudgery of picking and placing paper into the scanner, since there wasn't that much plot to follow, so if I missed anything, it didn't matter.
The movie opens with a commentary by ""Selene"", a ""Death Dealer"" mentioning ""Lycans"" and a ""war"", and the next two thirds of the picture are essentially Matrix-style gunfights and chases, peppered with occasional respites when the director and scriptwriter seem to run out of ""Ok, what can we shoot at or blow up next?"" ideas.
After about two-thirds of the picture, you finally get to find out what's actually going on, who is fighting whom, and why the previous hour-and-fifteen-minutes of bang-bang-boom-boom has been happening.  By that time, you may not care.
Cinematically, it's ""Matrix"" meets ""Clothing by Leather Masters"", shot in a uniformly gray-blue color scheme that leaves every battlefield in the movie looking like every other.
The only saving grace in this whole pointless and uninvolving exercise are the shots of Kate Beckinsale's face.  She's a superb actress, emotes well, and has a face which would haunt the dreams of a Renaissance painter or sculptor.

The acting was horrible, average special effects and the storyline was obviously a rip-off from blade. The action scenes were badly executed, and look extremely fake.
This movie basically tries very very hard to hide the fact that they copied nearly every aspect (including camera angles,costumes) from blade. And what's with the sound effects? The gun Kate Beck uses sounds like a toy gun.
There is nothing good about this movie, the main reason IMO ppl thought this movie rocked was because there was nothing else to watch when it came out.

Why supernatural beings need guns?
The thing is when they start shooting each other they are no different from your average Schwarzenegger movie: bad aiming, lots of shots, bigger guns, lots of mayhem. Everything made more confusing by the look-alike types of the characters (except the wonderful Beckingsale).

The wherewolf transformations look the way they do for a reason.  They are not the usual long drawn out transformation full of lengthy scenes of hair growing on someonew arms; these are new, more evolved werewolves that can change at will.  The action is non-stop; the movie keeps on rolling and doesnt slow down.  If you view this with a home theatre system you will be reaping some serious rewards.  And by the way, the acting is very well done.  The casting was perfect.  The main chick (selene) is hot, and the cast that plays the Liken (wherewolves) look like they really are dogs hiding under human skin.  Awsome movie!! Well done!!!",1081728000,,788,4.6521739130434785
1947624,5,B0000UI2NM,"I can't help but think that the mixed reception this film has gotten has more to do with its pretensions than its reality.  It is a very competent, if stagecrafty, vampire film.  It features lots of atmosphere and dramatic, gothic filmogaphy.  It takes place in a setting that is half Prague and half London - underground scenes, castle scenes and even a chase or two.  Stunts and costumes are excellent - the film uses costumes and stunts rather than CGI for it's effects - for a result that is, as someone else remarked, half Dracula and half Matrix.
The premise isn't completely original, but is well worked out, making vampires and lycans (werewolves) a kind of medical accident arising in the depth of the plague years developing a complex hierarchical society with vampires at the to and the werewolves at the bottom.  This somehow impacted, and lycans and vampires are at war, with the werewolves at a disadvantage.
In the midst of a hunt Selene (Kate Beckensale) finds that a nest of werewolves is determined to capture a human - Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman).  Her investigation puts her at odds with her coven's leader, Kraven (Shane Brolly), and the ensuing events reveal something so menacing that vampire and lycan are threatened.
In essence this is a pure action film not a horror film.  There are gestures at romance and the politics of the night but the primary movement is set scene - chase scene - fight scene.  While the acting is generally competent - Beckensale is quite good, and Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy are excellent as lycan and vampire elders - it isn't spectacular.  Certainly not good enough to make what director Ken Wiseman thought might be 'the greatest vampire story ever told.'
Seen purely as what it is, 'Underworld' is an enjoyable, fast-paced film that presents in interesting vision of life in the darkness.  Held against an arbitrary standard of greatness or a belief that it is the deconstruction of the vampire mythos, it falls short.  The Dracula remake is still the pinnacle of this genre, and may be for some time to come.  One the other hand I could watch films like this one after another without a single qualm.
The extras, feature films on the making of , etc., and several commentaries are excellent, and throw some interesting light on the film and its characters.  If you like foreboding technogothic thrillers this is made for you.",1081728000,2,2388,4.795121951219512
1947625,1,B0000UI2NM,"There are so many things wrong with UNDERWORLD it's hard to summon the energy to get pedantic whilst reviewing it.  There are some worthwhile concepts present, but all are never developed in a good fashion.
  KATE BECKENSALE is horrible.  A badly written character played with a badly miscast actress makes for a hard time watching with any conviction.  She just looks uncomfortable.
  The werewolf effects are atrocious.  With a plot surrounding a vampire/werewolf war, you end up rooting for the wolves; that is until you witness their transformation.  Bad FX.
  The action scenes are stillborn.  The build up is as suspenseful as slumber and the delivery is rehash.  Without some fleeting half-creativity the entire film is an all out rip-off of the ultra-far superior BLADE (1&2), and borrows some inspiration from THE MATRIXes.
  The direction is slipshod.  Obviously lensed by a first timer working with an amateur script.  I can't believe they are already filming not one but TWO sequels.  Totally unnessesary.
  Check out the flick DOG SOLDIERS instead.  That film has the action, horror, and werewolves, that works with the sense to not take itself seriously.
  Given the subject matter, UNDERWORLD should have been a lot better of a movie.  I love vampire and werewolf films, and there really aren't that many good ones.  UNDERWORLD has both aforementioned creatures, and still ranks at the botttom of both catagories.  So I'll have to say that it's definitely bad.",1081641600,5,1475,5.092436974789916

The premise is salvagable, and the overall look and feel of the movie, while not particularly new, ain't bad.
But now I have to wonder...
Why in the HECK do Viktor, Markus and Amelia have to hibernate?  What's the point in being immortal if you spend two of every three centuries asleep?
Aside from being able to jump off of buildings and frown a lot, what's the benefit of being a vampire?  They never leave the house, they drink packaged blood, and all (except Selene and Viktor, of course) get their butts kicked by the lycans on a regular basis.
Where does this take place?  There are European addresses and license plates, but when a reference is made to Amelia being on the other side of the ""great ocean"" yet arriving by steam train, I got confused.
WHEN does this take place?  They refer to Alexander Corvinus (from whom vamp and lycan both decended), becoming immortal because of some fluke encounter with Black Death in the 15th century.  Viktor talks about the ""chain"" of vamp elders being unbroken for 14 centuries.  So... the 29th century?  I don't get it.

Some people here have been downplaying it for certain aspects, such as vampires having reflections. Ok, first of all, get real. We're talking about vampires. Anne Rice's vampires have reflections, too, and aren't allergic to garlic, won't die from a stake in the heart, and can't be held back by a crucifix. Bram Stoker's Dracula could go out into the sunlight, and metamorphose into a flock of bats. Every culture has some vampiric entity that has different attributes that make it its own unique type of vampire. Personally, I think most of the popular vampire lore is silly - and much of it can be traced back to folkloric beliefs. Yet, I enjoy it all.

1947637,2,B0000UI2NM,"In an unknown city, vampires and werewolves have been waging a battle that has lasted for thousands of years. The vampires are growing weaker and the werewolves are growing stronger which causes werewolf hunter and vampire, Kate Beckinsale, to suspect that something is brewing when she witnesses the werewolves chase after a human who may have something special about him. So this sitcom plot develops with bloodlines and bad guys turning good guys and good guys turning bad guys and the story just becomes a very tedious episode of Dallas as we learn more about the characters' roots and their connections with surprise twists like - ""Bobby, I'm pregnant"" or ""J.R shot my dad"". Underworld simply has no direction whatsoever. It is not until the last few minutes of the movie that all is revealed but by then you don't really care and are more than laughing at how seriously this film takes itself for all its ridiculousness.
Underworld looks good most of the time but the Matrix sound effects only bring the film's style down a notch. Neo and Trinity with fangs this is not. As a competitor to films like Dark City and The Crow it doesn't even touch on the plot or gothic look of these movies. The dream sequences in Underworld are directly ripped from the same effect as Frodo seeing the eye when he puts on the ring of power. Now and again blaring plot holes surface that slap you across the face. Vampires have reflections? A lot of the film does not make sense.
So how does it work out in terms of popcorn fodder? Well Blade or Blade II is certainly leaps and bounds ahead of this one. Underworld kept my attention for all of it, but still I think I have forgotten most of it by the time I came to write this review. It is simply a no-brainer with elements that you have all seen too many times before. I like the whole vampire meets werewolf scenario but Underworld just misses everything that may have been good about it.

1947639,4,B0000UI2NM,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I and a thousand other gamers thought it was based off of the World of Darkness (WOD), published by White Wolf. In short, the World of Darkness is like our world only, uh, darker. And grittier. And full of angst.
Vampires and werewolves dominate the WOD. There's changelings, wraiths, and demons too. Normal humans? They're pretty much cattle.
Vampires and werewolves don't get along. Vampires are city folk, werewolves are country folk. Vampires like to be clean cut, werewolves like long hair and scruffy beards. Vampires hang out in old mansions drinking blood out of champagne glasses, werewolves beat the crap out of each other for fun in subway tunnels. Get the idea?
Not surprisingly, vampires are ""winning"" the war. Three elders oversee the vampire race (at least, in Europe), and one is awakened every so many centuries to lead. The movie takes place in the interim between vampire elder shifts. Kraven, the intermin vampire leader, is a turncoat who makes a deal with Lucian, the werewolf leader. Collectively, they intend to create an ""Abomination"" -- a serum that will turn Lucian into a werewolf/vampire hybrid. All other attempts to create such a hybrid have failed, but since vampires and werewolves supposedly share a common ancestor, mixing the two lines shouldn't be impossible...
Enter Michael Corvin, who has the gene to transform into a vampire/werewolf hybrid. A Wampire? A Verwolf? A Vampwolf? Nobody knows, but he looks like Nightcrawler when the transformation is through.
But I'm skipping ahead. Somewhere in all this messy plot is Selene, a Death-Dealer. Death-Dealers deal death to werewolves (duh). Of all the stupid names, ""Death Dealer"" has to be the worst. That's right up there with calling your fighter a ""Sword Wielder"" or your cleric ""Healing Guy.""
Selene (played by Kate Beckinsale) has a few things going for her. For one, she's hot. For another, she wields two automatic pistols. And for a third, she's a vampire. This makes her the goddess of all geek fantasies.
Am I oversharing? Ahem.
Selene was turned into a vampire by Viktor, one of the three elders. She is loyal to him (like a daughter to a father, the movie's VERY clear that it's not sexual). Only, it turns out Viktor killed her parents before turning her.
So for the most part, this movie is about a big build up to a mano-a-mano battle between Viktor the Elder Vampire and Michael the Half-Vampire/Half-Werewolf. Follow so far?
There's a few problems with the movie, not the least of which is that the sound was cranked up to eardrum twanging levels. I spoke with my parents, who also saw this movie, and they had the same complaint. This probably has to do with the enormous amounts of gunfire that place throughout the film.
Despite the completely unrealistic combat scenes, the movie seems to take great pride in showing characters reload their weapons. This is a little odd, as the automatic pistols themselves are fantastic conventions. Why show this at all?
Because on some level, it's as much about Gun Fu as it is about vampires and werewolves. Selene runs around in PVC firing at werewolves. She does that for most of the movie. There's not a whole lot of room for pacing, but a good Gun Fu movie knows that it has to give the audience a break. What better way than to reload a weapon?
The reloading -- and the infatuation the director has with filming it -- made me think of Equilibrium, the greatest gun flick of all time. Just as people compared Equlibrium to the Matrix (an unfair comparison), Underworld is a lot like Equilibrium meets Dark City. There's unbelievable shootouts, the main character is a death dealing machine (sort of like Equilibrium's Grammaton Clerics), everybody dresses in black, it's flimed with a gray lense, and the movie is about bucking the rules for love -- of one's family and of one's self.
Underworld also takes for granted, probably due to time contraints, that we all know what vampires and werewolves are. Which is funny. While they are definitely recognizable characters, they are not necessarily recognized the same way by the same generation.
Take, for example, my mother's interpretation of the movie. She was shocked that 1) vampires could bear children, 2) Selene could see herself in her reflection, 3) vampires displayed no vulnerability to water. And yet, they can leap onto ceilings and cling to them like spiders. I took all of this in stride, because I'm accustomed to the ""de-fanging"" of Anne Rice's vampires. This is now the fourth generation vampire: Nosferatu -> Dracula -> Lestat -> Selene. What you end up with are pale, superstrong, pretty people with fangs. They don't even drink blood. The vampires figured out how to clone it.
Which really makes the vampires the good guys. In comparison, the werewolves are dirty, violent, and come off as more than a little churlish. They're the lower class to the vampire upper class, and indeed, werewolves were the servants of vampires. So everybody wants to be a vampire and nobody really wants to be a werewolf.
Just like the evolution of vampires, werewolves have evolved. They no longer need to change during a full moon. Not only that, their organs regenerate. And they can run along walls and ceilings (not sure where that came from). Lon Chaney, Jr., if you could only see your progeny now!
The movie drags in parts, but perks up near the end with the titanic battle between Viktor and Michael. Unfortunately, Michael isn't given much to do other than freak out. His character development is almost nil in comparison to say, Selene, who gets to cry and pout and the aforementioned blowing the crap out of werewolves.
I liked Underworld, but it's because I'm biased. I also like the idea of the World of Darkness that the creators no doubt abhor -- Gun Fu style, monsters using their superhuman abilities to blow each other up. I mean, who doesn't like that?

Kate Beckinsale's character Selen is the new Ripley, she is taking over where Sigorney Weaver left off in the Alien series with a tough, beautiful, strong character. The incredible storyline of intertwining Vampires and Werewolfs is incredibly well done. This movie was beautifully shot in a dark tone with a gothic city as its backdrop. I have watched it about 4 times now and everytime I pick up something new.
The special features on the dvd bring a lot of interesting things to mind as well. I totally agree with director Len Wiseman, CGI has become too un-realistic, and way over used in movies. Using real people as the creatures make them that much scarier. Rent it, buy it....whatever, you won't be dissapointed.

I guess there was so much of that they didn't have time for a plot or character development it only has one star because of the back story. I didn't rent or buy it i borrowed it from a friend but i think im gonna charge him for wasting my time. This makes a Jhon Grisham book sound good.,1079568000,5,531,3.925925925925926

This vampire vs. werewolf film was shot almost entirely in Budapest, Hungary. I believe they chose Budapest for its old city feel and for the numerous underground locations. As with many other fans of this genre, I was excited by the prospect of the vampire vs. werewolf storyline. While I thought the plot was pretty good, I felt that it was a little too complicated and difficult to follow at times. However in the end the pieces came together quite nicely. The acting was pretty good as were the special effects. It was interesting to see Kate Beckinsale as an action hero...She did quite well!",1079395200,5,718,4.798387096774194

Costumes are great, settings are very gothic, the technology is really cool (they heavily borrow here from the TV series Ultraviolet).  The idea seems good, Vampires Vs Werewolves.  I was expecting the best of Blade Meets an American Werewolf in Paris.  But unfortunately this was not to be.
This film is like the guy who was oh so cool in high school, with the shades and the black leather jacket, looking sultry as he smoked cigarettes on his motor bike.  But then you meet him when you are 30 and he is still looking cool, but he works stacking shelves in K-Mart!!!!!  It looks great on the outside, but there is no substance.

1947645,1,B0000UI2NM,"Because it is loud, full of razzle-dazzle and (most of all) the characters are unattractive and unsympathetic. The story is weak, contrieved and full of umbelievable elements.
Having said that, I have to say this:
When I first heard about the movie, I thought ""Now that's a great idea... werewolves vs. vampires"". But when the film actually began, I discovered I was wrong.
For me, the problem lies in the fact that this movie does not know what it is. Is it a horror film? Is it an action movie? Is it Sci-Fi? It tries to be ""The Matrix"" with it's there's-a-higher-plot-behind-this-plot approach. I don't think it works nearly half as well. The story seems quite simple in the beginning with the old narrated explanation formula that sets the story. Then the film goes on forever and new complications keep on coming (and they get to be more and more unbelievable). The screenwriter thought he was constructing a grandiose story... but instead of this he created a pompous story... that's all.
Then comes the image. Most of the time, it has this annoying effect of flashlighting which supposedly gives the film a ""thunder-like"" thing thoughout the entire film. This is not new and has been used many times before with great effect. The problem here is exactly that every effect is overdone...
Then comes the looks. The film has this I've-seen-this-cool-before look that obviously comes from (you guessed it) ""Blade"" and ""The Matrix"". Maybe they used the same wardrobe... duh! But the thing that annoys me most is (for instance) the fact that the mansion where the vampires live seems like a lobby of a big disco... (laughs) nice-looking people sitting there doing nothing.
Then comes the characters... there's simply no one there for you to like!!! They are always full of (too) serious faces expressing the oh-so-big crisis and hidden agendas behind it all. And the story starts to be so pompous that you don't care about what happens next.
Then comes the ludicrous aspects of the screenplay... werewolves and vampires are engaged in a battle that is centuries old (all this backstory is stupid)... they have lots of technology and weapons (James Bond-like gadgets) and keep on loudly blowing everything that comes in the middle... and yet they are a veeeery secret thing that we humans do not know about. They blow everything and no one ever asks what's going on... Hmmm... ok.... and the cars... They destroy a Jaguar just to have a Maseratti on the next scene....
It's all too cool to be believable. Keep your copies of ""The Matrix"" and ""Blade"" instead. At least these films have much better characters!
And it is 2 hours long!!!!
Go check ""AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON"", ""THE HOWLING"", ""FRIGHT NIGHT"" and ""NEAR DARK"" instead... just to name a few.",1079222400,11,2755,4.851380042462845
1947646,2,B0000UI2NM,"Bela Lugosi and Lon Chaney Jr. would be turning over in their respective graves if they could get a gander at ""Underworld,"" a tale about a war between vampires and werewolves that turns this potentially interesting conflict into one long, unending shootout.
Gone are the days when Count Dracula and Barnabas Collins defined for us the image of a vampire.  No longer are these ""creatures of the night"" the suave, well-dressed aristocrats who inexorably - often reluctantly - seduced unsuspecting bystanders into baring their necks to fulfill the need for human blood.  The vampires in ""Underworld"" can't be bothered with such mundane and hokey paraphernalia as coffins, crosses, or cloves of garlic - not even with turning into bats at the first hint of trouble.  These modern day vampires talk on cell phones, drive fancy sports cars, use personal computers and fight with all the high tech weaponry modern technology and a limitless studio budget can provide.  With all this fun gadgetry to choose from, what's the point in being a vampire anymore?  The result of this is that ""Underworld"" plays more like an over-the-top gangster action film that just happens to feature supernatural elements than a horror film rooted in centuries' old traditions.
The werewolves are even less interesting than the vampires in this film.  Not only are both camps indistinguishable from one another in looks and appearance, but the werewolves actually come across as surprisingly ludicrous and unconvincing in the few scenes in which they undergo their lycanthropic transformations.  Special effects have become so impressive in recent years that even they have a hard time exciting an audience anymore.  A case in point:  when oh when are action film directors going to jettison that most annoying of all action movie clichs - gun battle scenes filmed in slow motion?  ""Underworld"" has them in spades and they quickly become tiresome and boring.  Even the typical urban gothic look of the film - replete with rain-soaked city streets and a perpetual thunderstorm taking place in the background - reminds us instantly of dozens of other, mostly superior outings like ""The Crow,"" ""Darkman,"" ""Batman"" etc.
""Underworld"" should have stayed below the ground where it belongs.",1079222400,5,2255,5.167582417582418
1947647,4,B0000UI2NM,"It's hard to decide whether I like Underworld or not. It is definitely a bold movie taking you into the world of darkness where now, vampires are at war with the lycans. I find it hard to like is simply because I'm sympathetic to the humans who are naturally caught in the middle. Though not shown in this movie, we can take for granted that humans will always be cattle.
The story is intertwined with love and blood feud like one of those shakespearean plays. Vampires warring with lycans and no one knows why. Selene is a memeber of the DeathDealers, vampires sworn to hunt and kill lycans. No one knows exactly why they are fighting or how it began and it is forbidden to search into the past. Now, the fabled lycan leader, Lucian, has reappeared and Selene feels that this could spell doom for the vampires. Plus she suspects that there is something wrong with the leadership in the vampire coven itself, namely, Kraven.
It's definitely action packed and I'm sure a sequel is to follow.  I enjoyed the plot twists though the love-theme didn't seems to develop but rather, just happen much like the big bang theory. The characters are definitely interesting. Not likable, especially for me, because I hate vampires and lycans both. The movie does a good job in not progessing into a gory horror show, but rather keep it to the action genre. It's definitely worth the watch for both story and good action.",1079222400,,1407,4.628

The plot (an ongoing war between vampires and their former slaves, werewolves)was promising, although perhaps more could be expected from it. Fine image, great soundtrack and the kind of gothic scenarios that I love. Acting was good, and Ms. Beckinsale looked gorgeous in her Matrix-bent vampire outfit. Action sequences were fine, except for the effect of the very last sword coup, which I found hilarious rather than impressing.

1947650,2,B0000UI2NM,"In fact, if you remove the fangs and claws and morphing werewolves, this is just another Matrix knock-off.  Guns, kicks, cars, phones, gizmos, leather outfits.  You almost expect Morpheus to appear to tell the story of the vampire-werewolf war from the beginning.
Well, of course, there's a touch of Romeo and Juliet, too, but don't they all?
the one refreshing angle here is that the vampires are surprisingly devoid of the powers of the popular modern vampire.  If one can ignore their uppity leather outfits and obvious good looks, they are almost a throwback to the earlier (medieval) vampires of Eastern Europe, before Bram Stoker invented ""Dracula"". They don't fly, they don't shape-shift, they can't even smell an ambush in a train station, an ambush by werewolves, no less. (I mean, if werewolves used to be servants of vampires as the story tells, then vampires should at least know how 'wolves smell.) they seem to have normal senses, relying a lot on electronic sensors and cameras to monitor their homes for intruders.  in terms of pure ability, the werewolves definitely outclass the supposedly superior vampires.
not that there are no nice touches. the way they fall from above, landing on one knee and then immediately getting up and walking off, is quite cool.  kate beckinsale lends some credibility to her character, but the rest of the vampires are just aristocrats in leather posturing for the cameras.  even here, the werewolf actors steal the show, although the lead one doesn't.

1947656,5,B0000UI2NM,"Wow. This movie was a surprise. I went and saw it in the theaters with a couple of friends on a Saturday night when we had nothing to do. I didn't expect much. I hadn't heard of the director. It's got the guy from Felicity in it (Scott Speedman). And it looked like a Blade rip-off. I thought the premise sounded cool & I love Kate Beckinsale. But, I thought it wasn't going to be very good regardless. Was I ever wrong!!!
Now don't get me wrong....this isn't the type of flick that wins oscars. And it's not even a movie that everyone seems to like. There is just something about the story, how it was shot, the characters, and the look & style of the film that appeals to me.
The story of vampires vs. werewolves is an interesting one. Apparently there has been a war between the two covents for centuries. And it's been happening right under our noses. Kate Beckinsale plays a ""Death Dealer"". Basically she is a hunter of werewolves. Thought to have almost been driven to extinction, the lycons (werewolves) have been living in the sewers and plotting a way to eliminate the vampires. When the lycons try to capture a human (Speedman), Selene (Beckinsale) tries to figure out why. Much action and killing insues.
This is a combination of a Blade & Matrix rip-off. Not so much in storyline or plot as in style and how the action scenes are shot. The special effects are done pretty well. They tried to use practical effects as much as possible, to keep the budget down and make it look more realistic. I found this to be a plus. The storyline is quite interesting, espcially when Selene awakens Viktor, the oldest and most powerful vampire.
The acting here is decent, with Beckinsale doing the best job of the bunch. I know some other reviewers would disagree with that comment, but she did what she could with what she had. This movie is not about award-winning acting. It's about killer gunfights and looking good while in them. This film has style and sleekness dripping from it. The movie never gets slow, even though it clocks in at a little over 2 hrs.
I know some people weren't impressed with this movie at all. But, I just went to the theater expecting nothing and got everything I could ask for my seven dollars. I can tell I probably like this movie more than some people would. But, if you are looking for a fun way to spend the evening, you could not go wrong renting this movie. I highly recommend this for a purchase, but if you are unsure give it a rental and then decide for yourself. I just hope they make a sequal.
The DVD features are kind of disappointing, however. The featurettes are ok, but nothing great. There are also two commentaries, trailers, & a music video. I wasn't expecting a whole lot here either, but the featurettes feal more like fluff than anything else.",1078444800,5,2796,4.495088408644401
1947657,4,B0000UI2NM,"There are three essential items you should have in order to fully enjoy this movie to the max:
1) A big screen TV, preferably widescreen;
2) A powerful surround-sound stereo system; and,
3) A love for horror/action flicks with a desire to sit back and
  just relax for a couple of hours.
Have these three things, and you will absolutely love this movie. The action scenes are quite intense, and the special effects are really something to behold. Now, when I watched this movie I lacked two of the basic elements to watch this movie properly (I don't have a big, widescreen TV, or a surround sound stereo system) so I know I could not have fully enjoyed this film, because a lot of what went into this film was its effects. Yet, I was hooked by the surprisingly interesting plot to this movie. The concept of mixing vampires and werewolves is one I have never come across before I watched this, so this intrigued me. However, I did not find a whole lot of substance to this movie besides this. The visual and sound effects are still quite good even on a normal TV (like what most of us have), and so I still enjoyed it in other ways.
Overall, I recommend this movie for action/special effects enthusiasts.

1947660,4,B0000UI2NM,"This is a unique movie, not in terms of gore and blood,but in terms of the subplot. Werewolves vs. vampires is not totally unique, but this is the first movie that features a city full of them, with no human intervention. They control their environment and its like a gang war at a supernatural level. The werewolves are a threat, but there is someone who wants to mix the blood and create a super creature. Can he do it?
The movie is not reliant at all on the special effects which, by the way, are top-notch. The story line -- absolute power corrupts absolutely -- is spellbinding enough on its own. The idea of a vampire falling in love wiht one of the few humans that is left is patronizingly dull, but it works becuase the human is transformed via a wolf bite; and now he seeks to bridge the gap because he is in love with the beautiful heroine (if you can say that) of the movie, Kate Beckinsdale.
I have seen her role once before, It is the role that was played by the Russian chick in Resident Evil. Neither of these women feared anything, and despite being in need of breast transplants, still captivate the screen with their athleticism, courage and androgynous antics.

1947661,4,B0000UI2NM,"Well as always, no need to waste time on the storyline but rather jump straight into praises and critisms.
Firstly, the plot is quite a commendable one. Not a lame plot but quite nicely done up with explainations that make some sense. The usual fare is to leave viewers with the questions hanging over their head. However the ending here is rather abrupt. One wonders, is there some Underworld 2 in store? Afterall directors these days seem notoriously fond of waiting to see how the first one fares and if it gets the raves, out comes number two but if it flops they shelve the sequel.
Secondly, lack of chemistry between Selene and Micheal. That is probably the most serious failing the movie has. I mean it is touted to be the equivalent of the gothic romeo and juliet correct? Well seeing Selene abruptly step up and half kiss Micheal really leaves you questioning ""Huh? Where did that bit come from?""
Thirdly, whats the deal with all the different accents? Perhaps this is not a serious problem to some but personally I find it weird to hear the British accent and the American accent all co-mingling. There was no mention of Selene being a British vamp or KRaven being from the US....honestly very puzzling.
LAstly, the effects of the movie were top notch. The transformation of the werewolves were good and realistic and they looked good not pathetic namby pamby  dogs some movies portray them to be. The scene in which you see Viktor come back to life is good as well. But the scene when Micheal becomes the combination of both species.....one word....awful. Honestly, couldn't they have done it some other way?
Oh yeah, ok one last bit [ I know i said lastly already] usually vampires are portrayed as more powerful creatures and the werewolves second rate stupid animals. To an extent that undercurrent runs but however it appears the werewolves have the slight upper hand here over the vampires perhaps due to strength or size....for one I've never seen vampires rely so heavily on guns to the point they are virtually useless without it. All they do is stand around and hiss with their fangs exposed. The only vampire to portray the strrength is Viktor.

1947664,1,B0000UI2NM,"I've been racking my brains trying to think of something positive to say about ""Underworld"", and I can think of three. Kate Beckinsale looks good in black latex, Scott Speedman has an air of vulnerability that suits his part, and there's an interesting story reversal at the end where we become less sure who the good guys are. That's it. And it's not enough to justify the cost of a DVD or a ticket.
The whole thing is just so derivative, mostly of ""The Matrix"" trilogy but also to a certain extent of the ""Blade"" movies. But it doesn't have the moments of flair that either of them have. It uses some of the characters from horror films, but it's not a horror film at all. After all, in horror films we identify usually with the human victims. Here the fact that vampires and werewolves kill humans is barely even mentioned. In fact there's not much point to them being vampires or werewolves given that their main weapons in the war against one another are good old fashioned guns and - ultimately - fist fights.
The basic premise of ""Underworld"" is that for centuries a war has been raging between vampires and werewolves, known in this movies as lycans because they don't have to wait for the full moon to change form, and they can run on walls and ceilings like the creatures in ""Alien"", another movie that this one shamelessly rips off.
As the movie opens one of the vampires Selene (Kate Beckinsale) realises that the lycans seem to have an interest in one human, Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman), that seems to go beyond the next dinner engagement. The lycans want his blood, because they have a cunning genetic plan. Rescuing Michael, Selene falls in love with him, although we have absolutely no idea why or when this happens. We only realise it because people keep saying so.
As the initially bewildered Michael, Speedman is one of the best casting choices. Regular television viewers may recognise him from ""Felicity"" as the eponymous heroine's long time boyfriend, and his more sympathetic side he's a good departure from the usual guys we find in this kind of movie.
The current leader of the vampires is a creep called Kraven (Shane Brolly). The name alone tells you he can't be trusted. He allegedly killed the lycan leader Lucian (Michael Sheen) many years ago. He didn't of course. He's actually in cahoots with him. Finding herself not getting the support from her leader that she needs Selene awakens the creature that made her a vampire, one of the vampire elders Viktor (Bill Nighy). The scene is set for an all out war.
On the basis of this movie, director Len Wiseman seems to have no idea of pacing and no idea of how to make characters sympathetic. No-one cares who lives or dies. Lacking that foundation it doesn't really matter what's happening on the screen. Things might be moving fast, but all you can do is wait for the end to come. Some reviewers have been impressed by ""Underworld's"" visual style, which mostly consists of making everything very dark and very blue. Hard to believe that cinematographer Tony Pierce Roberts also shot Merchant Ivory's `Room With a View"".
In terms of special effects, the werewolf transformations, which are achieved in a digital cartoon-like style, are a little strange and rough edged. And, as is often the case, the movie tends to freeze in its tracks for them to take place. And to be honest the werewolves are a bit laughable anyway.

This story jumps us right into the middle of a centuries old conflict and weaves it's way back into the past to bring the viewer up to speed. The premise is unique and it works. A refreshing break from the traditional genre that has been overworked to the point of boredom. ""Underworld"" jump starts the outdated story to the future using modern technology to jolt the carnage from two insatiable groups of killers. The twists of politically motivated schemes boil down to the same ole' motivation; love and power. Familial conflict and monsterous actions even for the undead make for an interesting storyline. But in the end, the story runs out of gas, for trying to show the many fascinating, and grotesque transformations and mutilations. Too much emphasis is placed on the visual and the storyline is left to unravel and then the obligatory underdog David slays Golieth ending. This movie is so close to being a new classic that could have built a franchise to rival any available. Kate Beckinsale gives a performance that will convince anyone, like myself, who had doubts about her abilaties to carry a movie and play an antihero/villianess. The narration is tired and unneccesary but not so much that it detracts from the overall experience of the movie. A must see feature for any fan of the genre.

Everything bad you've heard about this film is true. So is everything good you've heard. It really depends on a) You being able to suspend your disbelief mightily even within well-worn vampiric film conventions b) being able to put up with exceptionally crappy werewolf CG effects and c) getting past some of the worst acting in a modern hollywood release recently, including the normally charming Kate Beckinsdale in the lead role, who just looks bored and faintly embarrassed to be reading these lines. Really though, we've seen much worse crap than this in horror/action crossovers and despite the above-listed major problems, there are some genuinely fun moments, to laugh at if nothing else. I thought it was hysterical that thrown out as an afterthought at one point, it is mentioned that vampires don't really drink from humans anymore but subsist on artifical plasma. Not that the factoid advances the plot in any way, but I'm sure some exec hand wrote it in there because how else are you gonna make a crowd sympathetic to a man-killing female vampire?

In other words, this movie left me feeling like I might have missed some crucial piece of information in the first half when that piece of information was never actually given.  Not revealing the climax of the movie in the first 45 minutes is one thing, but a little more background would have been nice early on.  Also, there were just too many hard to follow ""shoot 'em up"" scenes...with the exception of the main characters I found it difficult to determine who was on whose side during many of the action sequences.  The main redeeming quality of the movie is the special effects...the morphing scenes from human to werewolf are pretty cool.  But that fact aside, the overall storyline was extremely thin...with several minor plotlines seemingly vanishing in midstream (primarily a plotline about a wannabe vampire queen) and a very unfleshed-out, spartan romantic connection between the main female and male protagonists.

In a sense, this is just one game session set on film and given music in the background.  It sounds as if people feel that this has all been done before, and in a sense, it probably has.  The idea of vampires forming small groups to try and stave off the onslaught of werewolves, who really are more powerful in the World of Darkness (from White Wolf games) is quite traditional.  So many of the points brought out that seem to contradict classic folklore falls almost perfectly with the World of Darkness.  Only the idea of Lycans as immortal is out of line.

1947684,5,B0000UI2NM,"""Underworld"" focuses on a war that has been going on for centuries between vampires and werewolves. For the most part, werewolves have become extinct. They have been hunted over the centuries by vampire soliders called Deathdealers. The werewolves however, have discovered a way to turn the war in their favor, by finding a human named Michale Corbin ( Scott Speadman). Michael has the genes necessary to survive a bite from both a werewolf and a vampire, which would help to create a species that would be deadly to the vampires. Things get even worse, when the lead Deathdealer Selene ( Kate Bekinsale) begins to fall in love with Michael. Now it is up to Selene to keep Michael safe from the werewolves so that both Michael and her species can survive.
There has been a lot of mixed reviews when it comes to this film, and the general consensus is that ""Underworld"" had promise but did not live up to the hype. However, I think ""Underworld"" lived up to the hype and then some. The best thing about this film, is that it offers the one horror battle that we have always wanted to see - vampires vs werewolves. The film pulls it off rather effectively, by demonstrating the hatred the two societies feel for each other. The reason the film pulls you in, is because both sides have valid reasons to be angry. You have a hard time choosing who to root for. The action and special effects in this film are first rate. There are plenty of Matrix like shoot-outs, and state of the art special effects to make the werewolves look rather terrifying. Scott Speadman and Kate Beckinsale are especially good as well, and bring the classic Romeo and Juliet element to the film. They have very good chemistry together.
Watching the two groups of classic movie monsters fight it out, really makes Underworld a terrifying thrill ride that will leave you begging for more after the film has ended. Every element of this film was great, from the outstanding plot and special effects, to the awesome action sequences and the forbidden love between a vampire and a werewolf.

1947686,2,B0000UI2NM,"It's a shame, really.  The foundation concepts of 2003's *Underworld*, on the page at least, indicate a genuine neo-Victorian epic.  In brief: a blood-feud war between vampires and werewolves; the viral strains of these outcasts and the possible intermingling of abomination-breeds; the historical elements detailing the cause of the conflict: although not exactly new or original, the alchemic combination of these ideas suggest vast potential, and practically beg for an expert treatment such as that given the recent blockbuster phenomenon of Lord of the Rings.  Alas, this film comes off rather a harrowing example of squandered opportunities and inept direction, the dismal end-result of rigorous conformity to the ethic of 'style over substance.'
A breakdown of the major faults:
STORY: The core concepts are modern-era mythic (always a plus) and brim with melodramatic possibility, but the actual script execution is muddled and/or obtuse, structural information delivered either too sparsely or without the necessary passion; the dialogue flat, unoriginal and uninspired, and so, so deathly serious.  The Vampires come off as lethargic [perhaps the result of conqueror's indolence?] weaklings [inexcusable for supposed 'immortals'] who have to rely on gunplay to dispatch their enemies - all in all a nice excuse to ape the Matrix to the hilt.
DIRECTION/CINIMATOGRAPHY: Technically, this film is a murky mess, with all the usual suspects included: MTV editing, sloppy framing and the occasionally horrid angle-confusion, an enormous overuse of digital grading.  Nearly the entire film is colored in nighttime blue, which becomes increasingly dull and stullifying as the story grinds towards its predictable peak (at least the Wachoski Bros. are aware of the power of contrasting colors); when coupled with the aggrandizing camera shots, the excess of shadow, the choppy editing to 'excite' (and hide), alongside some laughable moments of CGI, Underworld is a textbook example of how to attempt an epic via style over substance - and ultimately fail in engaging the participant.
ACTION: Blood-pumping? Nail-biting? Jaw-dropping? Sorry, none of the above.  I couldn't help but play ""spot the influence"" to overcome the threatening sleep-tides of ennui.  A snippy smattering of the famous action sequences Underworld blatantly rips off: The Matrix (obvious), The Matrix Reloaded (Trinity bullet-time flip), Terminator 2 (chase scene), X-Men 1 (Beckinsale's inexplicable swoon/car crash), Equilibrium (face slide), Blade 2 (final showdown).  And even when the film is not engaging in full-blown celluloid plagiarism, the action sequences suffer from weak pacing, poor editing and some absolute incompetence regarding weaponry and combat-tactics.  The scene where a nameless vamp takes on a lycin with two bullwhips is a prominent example.  Instead of using the whips to debilitate his foe (uprooting a leg, dislocation of an arm, spinning the whip around the neck to choke or at least attempt dominance of), the vamp simply swings both whips around in an impressive but ultimately futile grandstanding display of practice-strokes, and pays the price accordingly.  It looks cool, but fails to elect any sort of tension or violent 'rush' -again, style over substance.
ACTING: Some actors/actresses are able to overcome the shoddy character-building or trite dialogue of a mediocre script by way of sheer charisma or craft-experience.  Kate Beckinsale, reported to be a talented actress, is not one of those rare paragons of dramatic impersonation.  There's little required for Beckinsale other than the twin stoic reliance of serious/slightly pouty; she isn't given the time or dialogue to sell her tragic past, and the chemistry between her and Speedman is nearly non-existent.  Her character is essentially her leather outfit, cute bob haircut, and twin firepower skills - in other words, style over substance.  Scott Speedman's doctor/lychin, meanwhile, remains passive throughout, thrown into one situation after another like any stereo-archetypical ""chosen one"", a rote mold made all the more boring by the Matrix Reloaded's expert deconstruction of the savior/slave role.  The fellow who plays Victor chews the scenery with gusto and adds a much-welcome dollop of humor to this bleak affair, while 'Kraven' tries to do the same and his howlingly-bad performance jars the viewing experience.
I always give credit where credit is due: the film looks marvelous given its relatively measly budget of $23 million, and several of the core concepts were initially promising.  The potential was there.  But the astonishingly poor execution from those involved rendered this vampire tale flatline on delivery.  If you must, eat fistfuls of garlic before braving a view of *Underworld* - the subsequent hyper-jolt might actually make this more the sum of its incompetent parts.",1076976000,2,4875,5.537012113055182
1947687,1,B0000UI2NM,"Underworld has a great premise with the conflict of Vampire and Werewolves fighting over domination but while it's a good premise, it needs a story to support it, and if you don't have a good story then you don't really have anything. The movie is more style than substance, and while style is good, it can also ruin a movie if you don't have anything to back it up. Kate Beckinsale and company do their best with what is giving but even their best efforts can't hide the fact that the story feels like it was written on the fly, and rush into production with out a good rewrite to help punch up the script. On top of that, the special effects are of not top quality, and you can see that in the way the Werewolves look and move. You really don't them at all, and when you do, it's very brief and mostly in the dark.

1947689,1,B0000UI2NM,"Take Blade and add most of The Crow and The Matrix and you have this. The latter two I didn't particularly enjoy and Underworld was just as dull and messy as the trailer made it out to be.

Amidst a clutter of cliched sets, impossible to differentiate from each other, and heavily overused lightning and rain (I'm sure there are OTHER ways of creating a gothic atmosphere) an uninteresting and meandering plot slowly fizzles to life. Apparently Vampires and Werewolves have been fighting for years but a couple of them want the war to end. But with no indication of who is good and bad and the lack of a clearly defined hero there's no way to engage with the characters and no reason to care what happens to them.

The SFX are of the jumping thru the air in slow motion while spinning and shooting and doing the laundry variety. Nothing you haven't seen a zillion times before. It wasn't interesting the first hundred times I saw it and this movie is no exception.

As you might expect from a movie of this sort, the music is nothing but someone murdering a thrash metal guitar. It's just noise and chaos that matches the incoherent blur onscreen. Many elements of this film lead to exciting possibilities but they've all been thrown away in favor of easy trash. Technically efficient it may well be but Underworld is a failure on every other level.

And what's with the title. At no point in the entire movie is there interaction with the 'real' world. Just a load of running around in sewers and darkly lit mansion corridors. The sense of having an insight into a world that is not meant to be seen by human eyes is non-existent. Even the kidnapped human acts as if the discovery of Vampires and Werewolves is nothing to out of the ordinary.
Highlyclichedlookinggothicmovieworld would have been a more appropriate title.

And the 2.35:1 anamorphic picture is super. But no matter how good looking it is, Underworld is still terrible.",1076803200,7,2166,4.642297650130549
1947690,3,B0000UI2NM,"As an introductory film to hopefully a larger, more epic and expansive series, Underworld fulfills its requirements adequately. There's enough action, blood, and tight latex outfits to satisfy a genre fan's thirst and the execution is decent enough that I look forward to the sequels, but there's the unmistakable sense of promise left unfulfilled.
Set in an unnamed city, the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale stars as Selene, a ""Death Dealer,"" a vampire whose job is to hunt down the remaining Lycans, aka Werewolves. According to vampire history, most of the werewolves should have been wiped out in past wars, but a subway venture reveals there is still a formidable-sized population of werewolves. Against the wishes of her master, Kraven (Shane Brolly), Selene investigates further and discovers that the werewolves are particularly interested in a human named Michael (Scott Speedman).
After an encounter with head werewolf Lucian (Michael Sheen), Michael is bitten but saved by Selene, who grows infatuated with this human. Why, is never made clear, other than the fact that he prevents her from drowning. As Selene pries deeper into the mystery surrounding Michael, she uncovers a conspiracy involving both vampires and werewolves that could tip the balance of the war.
As most people have already said, by far the movie's most memorable image is the sight of Kate Beckinsale in tight latex. For those who find her a hot babe (like me), Underworld might just be worth watching for her alone. Hell, if she'd shown some nudity, I would have even bumped my rating up 1/2. Alas, she's still great eye-candy.
The picture itself is a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, there's lots of shootouts and fight scenes that are well-staged and filmed and reasonably exciting. The werewolf effects are excellent and the transformation scenes are some of the slickest, most convincing I've seen on-screen, certainly better than anything seen in The Howling or An American Werewolf in London. Beckinsale, in addition to being a delectable hottie, makes for a kick-ass, first-rate female action hero.
But on the other hand, Underworld is a grim, joyless picture, accentuated by its deadly serious performances and occasionally laughably earnest dialogue. Much like the Blade films, a lot of what the characters have to say is hard to take seriously, the mythology hampered by the fact that it's being juxtaposed with CGI-infested action scenes (though, admittedly, any five minutes of Blade has a much worse problem with this than all of Underworld).
Underworld is neither scary nor suspenseful. Selene never really gets herself into any combative situation she can't get herself out of, usually because most of the opponents she fights aren't nearly as skilled as her. Though there are plentiful werewolf effects, I think I would have preferred more scenes of Lycans skulking around in their hulking bodies rather than watching them in human form.
Undoubtedly, Scott Speedman must be one of the worst examples of a romantic leading man I've seen. He and Beckinsale have no chemistry, and considering it's her affection for him that spurs her to ""betray"" her own kind, this is a pretty damning flaw. It's also during her scenes with Speedman that Beckinsale is at her least convincing; she won me over as a kick-ass vampiress, but I had a hard time believing she was in love with this bland nobody named Michael.
Directed by first-timer Len Wiseman (who apparently stole Beckinsale's heart on-set, enough that she left Michael Sheen for him), Underworld is slickly-crafted and boasts a strong, pervasive atmosphere. Maybe with more passionate performances, more well-orchestrated thrills, and some bare skin from Kate, the sequel will be an unqualified success.

It was comfusing at times and all of the stunts were Matrix and Blade redos that just weren't as well pulled off IMHO.  The greatest disappointment was that the premise of the story was a great idea but it just wasn't done in a way that made sense.  Mediocre dialog between Selene and Victor (Lord of the Vampires) and Craven (his wannabe successor).  My biggest question was what did all the Vampires who hung around the ""Vampire Mansion"" do besides lay around??

The writers apparently thought that Werewolves needed a nerdy name, Lycans and Vampires needed redeemable qualities; they don't eat humans. The point of all this resides in one bad vampire king. I think it would have been much more interesting if neither the Vampires or Werewolfs would have had redeemable qualities. Making monsters act human for the sake drudging along an unoriginal love story with no payoff is just stupid.

I didn't like any of the characters and couldn't care less who lived or died. Kate Beckinsale's performance was very sterile. The whole movie takes place in nighttime and is terribly dark. All the scenes are so dark, even the action sequences were almost ruined by the darkness. They also kept showing very annoying flashbacks (that made no sense at all).

1947699,5,B0000UI2NM,"I avoided this movie when it came out in the theater, dismissing it as ""yet another Vampire/Werewolf rehash""; a presumptuous sentiment I now regret, having recently watched it for the first time on DVD. My opinion of it now? Quite the opposite... I *love* this movie. ""Hooked"" is another good word to describe my reaction to it.
The creators of this film have done a wonderful job of taking the conventional Vampire/Werewolf mythos and twisting it around, taking a fresh new approach. No mysticism, crucifixes or wooden stakes here... There are sunlight and silver bullets... though Len Wiseman and co. have given the theme a scientific twist that is convincing and consistent. Many may dislike this new direction, but to me, it's a breath of fresh air.
To his credit, director and co-writer Len Wiseman made the decision to go with less CG for the creature and special effects, opting for the tried and true method of using prosthetics, make-up, cables and animatronics. The results are, for one example, werewolves that have a more tactile and real look to them, where computer-generated effects all-too-often are never quite convincing enough. There are a few CG moments scattered throughout the film, but they're fleeting, used to good effect and do not detract from the movie at all. It's a lower-budget film with very high production values. The sets are great and the whole movie really maintains the dark and gritty feel that its title evokes.
How about the story?
I won't go into the premise of the film. Many others here have already done a fine enough job in their reviews. I will say the story is another aspect of this film that, for me, elevates it far above being ""just another supernatural slasher/horror flick"". The story starts off seemingly simple... Vampires and Lycans (werewolves) have been at war for centuries and a specific group of Vampires, called Death Dealers, are charged with bringing about the Lycans' extinction. The movie starts out explaining this on-going battle through the narration of the films main protagonist, Selene who is, herself, a Death Dealer. However, as the story develops, you find that there is much more going on than originally revealed and, by the end of the movie, there are enough twists and turns to satisfy even the most jaded viewer.
It's intelligent and is conveyed via well written and delivered dialog. I cannot think of one line in this movie that seemed cheesy or made me cringe. One scene in which Viktor, one of the Vampire elders, slays a Lycan was taken a *wee* bit farther than necessary, I think. But that's hardly a complaint... just a minor personal quip.
The casting and acting in Underworld also receives high marks. For one, Kate Beckinsale (Selene) delivers an absolutely stunning and intoxicating performance. She's perfect in this role and, by the way, looks incredible.
For their part, the rest of the cast deliver a solid performance as well. There are no cardboard-cutouts in this movie. Every actor commands their role skillfully and adequately and I found myself caring about what happens to each one.
I could go on much longer about this movie, and there would be nothing but positive.. but I think I've made my point :-).
If you want to see a slick, stylish and all around well-done movie, you'd do well to see Underworld.",1076198400,5,3308,4.887900355871886
1947700,3,B0000UI2NM,"""Underworld"" was a very interesting film to watch. Part horror/action film, this film manages to have a interesting and original storyline, fine cinematography and a good performance by Kate Beckinsale. Despite its strengths, it sometimes lacks ""bite"".
In a film inspired by THE MATRIX and THE CROW, this movie easily seperates itself from because it's about vampires and werewolves. The storyline has the two battling an ancient war for over a 1000 years. Vampire hunteress Selene(Beckinsale) rescues a ill-fated human named Michael(Scott Speedman) from Lycans, a.k.a werewolves. She then stumbles upon a conspiracy by the Lycans, who have turned Michael into one of them, in order to exterminate the vampires. Selene struggles to keep Michael from becoming a Lycan, but gets help from an ancient vampire, Victor, who isn't all he seems. Then of course there's a battle between the two races.
I liked the story, but this film just plays by the numbers. This film has a dark and gloomy atmosphere, which I like, yet the film fails to be more gritty. Horror fans will be dissapointed with the lack of blood this film offers, but many may be glad with just the story, which has surprising twists and turns. The special effects aren't all that special, since there's nothing groundbreaking about it. The action wasn't really productive either, just grade B stuff. I felt sometimes this really was a low budget actioner, but it's still stylish now and then.
""Underworld"" was a film basically filled with a bunch of familar ideas which rewrites what we think of vampires and werewolves. But I just didn't get what this film said to me, because I just wasn't all that excited what it had to offer. Despite some strengths, ""Underworld"" was a very mixed movie to watch.",1076198400,,1761,4.952702702702703
1947701,2,B0000UI2NM,"Vampires fighting werewolves, and Kate Beckinsale in leather, are the twin promises of ""Underworld"", and you'll probably be happy if your expectations are no higher than that.  To be fair, the lavish digital imagery suggested by the trailer is deployed with impressive restraint, and the film is distinguished from most other effects-intensive offerings by its determination to tell a story.  The problem is that the story it chooses to tell is convoluted, unmotivated and, in the end, not a particularly thrilling one.  What starts as a promising detective-tale-with-love-interest collapses under the weight of its own backstory and the apparent need to lay the ground work for a sequel. A tale of night-stalking monsters, blood disorders and forbidden love is surely ripe for a psycho-sexual subtext, but Danny McBride's screenplay seems content to make a few passing references to black slavery and leave it at that.  He was clearly more concerned with writing chase sequences involving a variety of expensive vehicles and cramming in enough ""acting"" roles for all his old stuntman buddies.  As director, Len Wiseman's adman pedigree is far too obvious.  He delivers one or two interesting shots, but generally relies on an aesthetic owing too much to rock videos, computer games and ""The Matrix"" ever to be truly engaging in its own right.  Still, the whole package shows enough promise to keep me interested in what these guys do next.  On a budget of $23 million, they've delivered a lot of movie for the money.",1076198400,,1517,5.113360323886639

The whole love story that was built up between the two major characters was a major let down in being that for starters, Beckinsale and Speedman didn't come across as having any real chemistry.  Also, the love story plot was barely touched upon when I felt they tried to sale the movie on that focal point.
The music/score was tacky and somewhat cliched for this movie and while I'm tempted to say the same for the costuming and setting, I liked the lighting used for the movie.

1947704,4,B0000UI2NM,"As far as extras go, this DVD really does not have a whole lot, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. On the merits of the movie itself, I would give it 5.
Kate Beckinsale plays Selene, a Vampire Death Dealer who has the job of hunting down Lycans (Werewolves) and killing them. Apparently there has been a war between the Vampires and Lycans going on for a really long time. At the beginning of the film she learns that the lycans are interested in a certain human, so the rest of the story revolves around her figuring out why the human is so important. There are many twists as you find out that some good guys are actually bad and vice versa....some which I didn't even see comming.
There are some MAJOR loose ends that are left at the end of the movie, partly because I think they were planning on making another one at some point. This movie can stand by itself, don't get me wrong, but it never says what happens to a few key characters at the end.
The characters of the movie made it though. I really like Selene, partly because she was a woman and could kick ass (girl power!). Michael, the human, was interesting. At first I was a little annoyed with his laid-back-deer-in-headlights act, but he got more agressive later on. Plus, yeah, he was a little attractive. What can I say! Lucian, the head Lycan, was my favorite, and when you watch the movie you will see why. If I said anything else about him, I would be giving up too much story. He was just cool!
The style and feel of the movie is much like the Crow and the Matrix (a few of the fight scenes), like other reviewers have mentioned. The city is dark and dirty, and always seems to be bathed in blue light. It rains alot and everyone, even humans, always seem to be wearing black. But this also gives the movie an Any-big-city feel. I had the feeling it was in the USA, but it could just as easily have been across the ocean.
So, as far as style, the movie has great mood.
As far as plot, not the most original, but still pretty creative. Its hard to come up with something completly new.
And the Actors - I believe they were well chosen and did a good job. Not really BIG name actors, so you could look at them and see their characters, and not *who* they are in real life.

Given that I believe, as I do with many movies, that it is best not know too much about the story so as not to build up any expectations.  Even with that I was pleasantly surprised, it wasn't too much of a love story (thankfully!) and the plot had a few little surprises (but don't look for any big twists). There was just a slight shift in my perception towards the end, which was one of the nice little surprises.  I like horror/vampire movies, strong female characters and I won't usually admit this, but I'm beginning to believe that I am a closet goth.  I got really excited when I learned that there's a book (I'm sure better detail) but not that it was a movie first, oh well.",1075766400,,773,4.273972602739726

This is one of the few half decently funded movies where fans were allowed to make the movie instead of studio suck-ups (not that there isn't a time and a place for studio suck-up movies, and by the standards of theatrical releases this movie was under-funded).
The DVD lacks deleted scenes, which having read the novelization I'm well familiar with, but this is excusable because the commentary explained how they weren't allowed the time to do enough shoots, and many scenes were cut simply because they couldn't be made to look right in the editing room.
The other problem was the lack of the documentary ""Fang vs. Fiction"" which had been made to promote the movie, I can't understand WHY they'd cut it, it showed the basis of this war in real legends.  There supposedly WAS a war between vampires and their former werewolf slaves in the 1400s.",1075766400,,887,4.790849673202614
1947707,4,B0000UI2NM,"This is a love story very much in the line of Romeo and Juliet, where the lovers come from two different families who have been feuding for centuries and that no matter how hard their families fight against their love, they belong together. Except, this is also a tale of vampires and werewolves.
Selene (Beckinsale) is a ""death dealer"", a vampire soldier who dedicates her life to killing the Lycans (the werewolves). On one of her stakeouts, she spots two Lycans following a human, Michael Corvis (Speedman) for reasons unknown to her. After a confrontation with the Lycans, she starts discovering many secrets about the war amongst the two races and about Michael.
Now, how can a movie about vampires *and* werewolves go wrong? I really don't know, but this movie manages to disappoint. Mind you, it's a fine movie. It's fun, it's got good action scenes, it's got good f/x, but there's something missing. Maybe the story or the character development could have been handled somewhat differently (a little more back story, perhaps?). The acting is another thing; Beckinsale is pretty good in this, but the role offers very few moments to shine. Speedman is barely on this side of being a wooden totem, and the rest of the cast tend to over act whatever few lines they have (and what's with the voice of the big, black Lycan?).
The look of the film is quite good. Very dark and moody. The costumes are very Matrix-y (as well as some of the f/x) but their given proper use. The transformation of the Lycans is not as good as it could have been, but it doesn't really take from the film.
In my opinion, this movie could have been made better with a little bit more back story and better character development (we get where Selene is coming from, but the rest? Only Lucian (Sheen), the head Lycan receives a bit of explanation).
The movie's ending lets the door open for a sequel, and talks are supposed to have been going on about not only one but two new movies, one of them being a prequel. This makes sense because eventhough the film *only* made 52MM at the box office, the reported budget was 23MM.",1075766400,,2102,4.608
1947708,1,B0000UI2NM,"With all of the money thrown into the special effects of this movie, you'd think it would be pretty good horror/scifi. But it's not.

Absolutely, yes, everybody in the movie looks fabulous in leather (and everybody's under 20 except the ancient vampire), so if you like your movies in the violent eye-candy style with plenty of blood and slow-mo fight scenes, then this may be for you. I felt like I wasted the $4 rental fee on it; I'd suggest you rent it first before you blow this much money on a second-rate movie. If you like horror, try Ringu (the Japanese original) ---- truly frightening, without reliance on buckets of blood or really any graphic violence. I haven't seen the Hollywood remake, but the original was amazing. Or, if you're feeling adventurous, I really liked George Clooney's remake of Solaris. I saw the original Russian version, which had a lot of 70s Russian cinematic tics (like long, slow, pointless establishing shots and the overdevelopment of extremely minor characters); Clooney's remake is startlingly faithful to the original, which may be why so few people liked it --- the pace was slow, too --- while paring down the truly incomprehensible plot offshoots. If you can free yourself from your Hollywood expectations of how fast stuff should happen on screen, the Solaris remake is very good scifi. Good viewing!",1075766400,7,1680,4.898245614035088
1947709,3,B0000UI2NM,"""Underworld"" was marketed as a Romeo and Juliet story within horror elements of werewolves and vampires. The romance between the vampire (Kate Beckinsale - great in latex!) and would-be werewolf, or rather ""Lycan"" (Scott Speedman) is nearly nonexistent save for a few kisses and lingering stares.
The story is really a series of extended action sequences and the inner politics and scheming of the vampire elite and hunted lycans. I actually some of the plot ideas intriguing, with the racial homogeneity issues, and the history between the various characters such as Viktor (one of the vampire elders), Lucien (leader of the lycans presumed dead for centuries but conducting nasty bio-tech like experiments) and Kraven (the vampire who allegedly killed Lucien and now leads the coven, but has some shady dealings...)
Beckinsale as the assassin Seline is the most ""human"" of the groups, and her conscience leads her to some startling discoveries as she attempts to save Michael Corvin (Speedman) from both the vampires and the lycans.

The Werewolves (Lycans) do tend to show their tendancies more. They ""make the change"" quite more often.
But this film goes past a mere sci-fi gory bloodbath. Although it doesn't really seem like one exists early, there is a plot. And it's not a bad one, but the film does tend to get pretty predictable. That would have to be it's main downfall.

1947711,1,B0000UI2NM,"There are two kinds of directorial debuts. There are the kinds that instantly establish directors as critically-acclaimed and immensely talented, and then there are movies like ""Underworld."" Len Wiseman's vampires vs. werewolves flick had so much promise, and just about all of it is squandered.
The vampires and Lycans have been at war for centuries, for reasons that are revealed later in the movie. Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is one of the vampires whose sole duty and purpose is to hunt down and kill the Lycans (a ""death dealer,"" har har) with guns that shoot silver bullets. The Lycans, in turn, fire ultraviolet bullets that can kill the vampires. Whatever.
Enter Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman), a young human who is being followed by the Lycans. Selene is intrigued by why he's important to the Lycans, but unfortunately he's been bitten by one, and is now in danger of becoming one. To uncover the answers about why Corvin is important, Selene will uncover the truth about both the Lycan and vampire races -- and secrets about her own past.
There hasn't been a halfway decent vampire flick in uncounted years, or a decent werewolf flick in even longer. Looks like that  Taking ""Underworld"" even semi-seriously is hard to do; it's like the unwanted illegitimate child of ""Matrix"" and ""Blade,"" without the appeal of either. The special effects are okay, but the story and action (not to mention the near-nonexistant romance) are as cold and clammy as a vampire's kiss.
Wiseman's clumsiness is shown vividly in the action scenes, which are all cloned from ""Matrix"" -- lots of bullets, swirling leather and antigravity jumps. And some humor might have elevated this film to action camp, but heroes and villains alike are so earnest that they almost come across as goofy. There are plenty of gaping plot holes that could have been avoided (why do vampires spend all their time lounging around?), but Wiseman apparently doesn't bother to try spackling them shut.
Kate Beckinsale, a talented young actress, is horribly wasted here. Most of her time is spent pouting and wearing how-can-she-move leather. Her chemistry with Speedman is nil, which is good, since the romance between them is also virtually nonexistant. Speedman does what he can, but he doesn't have much to work with. Bill Nighy alone gets to chew the scenery as senior vamp Viktor.

The funny thing is that it's the similarities to VTM that are this otherwise shallow and hokie movie's redeeming features. See this film is entertaining, it's not horrible, but it's not great either. It's certainly better than any other vampire movie I've seen of late, which is sad really... It's just disturbing to me that the only thing I really enjoyed about this movie was watching for subtle not-so-unintentional similarities to Vampire the Masquerade.
 The irony is that having been a rabid White Wolf addict-fan for the last thirteen years I have had my level of expectations for vampire movies and literature raised so high that even White Wolf themselves can't always meet the expectations because so much of their past work has been beyond excellent. Its difficult for anything to live up so such expectations without ripping off the World of Darkness completely, and while I don't think that was the intention of this film they did come pretty close to doing that, and I really hate to say it, but if they had just ripped off more elements of Vampire the Masquerade and Werewolf the Apocalypse the movie, including the brilliant narrative of the White Wolf writing staff, and we would have had a masterpiece of a vampire movie, up there with Interview with the Vampire. Instead all we have is a few (like 60 according to White Wolf's lawyers) points of similarities mixed in with Romeo and Juliet, minus the tragic ending, and without any real character development, or decent dialogue, plus characters who don't realize that when you're pumped full of silver nitrate you're supposed to be dead, as in no getting up... I think the lesson that needs to be learned from this movie isn't ""don't rip of Vampire The Masquerade"" it's ""For crying out loud you know you want to, just make Vampire: The Masquerade into a movie!""

Long ago, a human was born whose body was able to rapidly alter itself to resist environmental conditions.  This allowed him to survive a plague that destroyed his village.  His children inherited that trait.  One was bitten by a bat and spawned a race of vampires, while another was bitten by a wolf and spawned a race of werewolves (a.k.a. lycans).  A third did neither and hence the trait also survived in 'normal' humans.  This divergence of races was long ago forgotten, and vampires and werewolves are now at one another's throats (har har) over a millenia of real and imagined slights.  Kate Beckinsale plays a melodramatically-named 'Death Dealer', a vampire devoted to fighting lycans, who falls in love with a lycan candidate.  Unbeknownst to all but a few tricky lycans, that candidate is a descendent of the 'human' strain of the original sire of all three races, and has the potential to become a hybrid vampire/lycan.  Much mayhem and throat biting commences.
Now, it's pretty obvious from the get-go that logic needs to get chucked out the window.  Similarly, there's about as many sparks flying between Beckinsale and her love interest as there is between the mayonnaise and bologna in a bad deli sandwich.  However the film does a surprisingly, almost effort-savingly good job of representing the various packs of night critters involved.  The lycans impressively shape shift into massive, combat-oriented werewolves whenever angered (quite similar to another underappreciated recent film, 'Dog Soldiers'), and while the vampires don't do a lot of typically vampiric things like mind control or turning into packs of rats, they at least manage the 'gaunt and world-weary' thing well.  You also get a sense of the hide-bound nature of their world, which is based on the endless rule of centuries-old elders and ancients, with newer vampires stuck in an immortality bereft of change or advancement.  There are some great action sequences, a lot of fine back stabbing, and generally a great deal of enthusiasm on all sides when the fur starts flying.  It really is almost enough to make up for the paper-thin plot and makes for a perfect summer movie..grab some popcorn and just enjoy the ride.
On a side note, the general plot and themes seem to have been basically lifted wholesale from an entire book/RPG system of vampires v. werewolves that has been published by White Wolf for decades, to such an extent that I thought White Wolf had sponsored the film.  Apparently not, given the fact they're suing over it (see the 'quotes and trivia' link in the product description above).  If you've ever heard of them, you may be interested in this film as well.",1075420800,3,2949,4.933198380566802
1947719,3,B0000UI2NM,"Good movie, bad movie, whatever.  I enjoyed ""Underworld"" despite some plot holes, ridiculous ammo counts in the guns, and general wussiness on the vampires' part.
My gripe is with the technical aspects of the DVD itself.  Yes, I'm behind in the times, but I don't have surround sound in my living room.  I've watched this DVD at a friend's house, and it sounded SPECTACULAR.  However, I've tried watching the DVD at home, and I'm just plain baffled.  Guns will be raised, people will fall, and I'll have to assume someone was shot, because the gun will make no sound.  There are other weird parts too, where Lucian extrudes the bullets for example.  I KNOW that APC's Judith remix plays during the scene, but I don't hear it all, although the bullets landing on the floor sound crystal clear.
I can only assume they mixed it for Dolby 5.1 only, because there isn't a stereo/surround-sound choice in the Audio setup, just English and French.  Maybe I should watch it in French some time, and see if they get more sounds.",1075334400,2,1019,4.653631284916201
1947720,1,B0000UI2NM,"This was definitely on my list of the worst films of 2003. A boring monster flick starring Kate Beckinsale (who really is a good actress and should have known better), this movie is ostensibly about an age-old conflict between vampires and werewolves. Instead, it's a remarkably tired and predictable plot that exists mainly as an excuse to show Beckinsale in tight leather. The dialogue is awful, the storyline (ooooh, what a big mystery) was obvious from the first frame, and the climactic battle scene relied on one of those movie moments that's so ridiculous you feel compelled to shout out, ""Oh, COME ON!"" in the middle of the movie theater. To be fair, Bill Nighy did make a suitably creepy villain, but he deserved a better movie to do it in.

1947723,3,B0000UI2NM,"I swear, some people expect too much from action movies these days.
This movie is set in the RPG world of White Wolf's Werewolf and Vampire.  If you don't know what an RPG is, it's a role-playing game like Dungeons and Dragons.  The whole plot, the setting, the characters and the way they interact with each other are lifted from the rule books.
Is this a bad thing?  No, not really.  It's a good story, though a bit contrived.  But there aren't many good vampire movies being made these days.  Blade was okay, but after the vampire club scene at the beginning, the rest of the movie was anticlimactic.  Bram Stoker's Dracula was a joke with Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves competing for the worst fake British accent oscar.  Dusk 'till Dawn was fun, but not great.  I think the last really good vampire movie was Dracula, the one from the late 70's with Frank Langella and Lawrence Olivier.  That's not a lot of good vampire movies in the last 25 years.
This movie was a solidly good one from an action movie standpoint.  The weakest point was the love story between Kate Beckinsale's character and a newly created werewolf, one that was sort of the werewolf version of Neo in the Matrix or Paul Atreidies of Dune.  There really wasn't much of a spark between them.  I understand Kate's character being portrayed as cold and distant early on in the film, but she never really warmed up later to her so-called ""love interest"".
I enjoyed the action and definitely enjoyed Kate Beckinsale running around in tight black Matrix-esqe fetish gear (sorry, I did).  Her repeated entrance through the front door of the vampire's mansion became rather repetitive, and it's use to show off all the pretty goth vampires hanging around being terribly decadent got a bit boring.  After reading the negative reviews I didn't expect much and was actually pleasantly suprised, but I'm a fan of the genre and never think an action movie is going to be something it's not.",1075248000,,1952,4.666666666666667

1947726,4,B0000UI2NM,"For several hundred years, vampires and lycans (werewolves) have fought a long war. Most of the vampires don't understand why they are at war, but believe that they have nearly wiped out the lycans, or have they?  Thus begins the 2003 film ""Underworld"", which was under the direction of Len Wiseman in his directorial and authorial debut.  He co-wrote the film's story with Kevin Grevioux and Danny McBride, who also both played the characters Raze (a fierce lycan) and Mason respectively and were two of the film's associate producers.  The lead character in the film, a vampire soldier named Selene, is played by the actress Kate Beckinsale, who is remembered for playing the leading female character in the melodramatic 2001 film ""Pearl Harbor"".
As a soldier, Selene is known as a Death Dealer.  She and her fellow Death Dealers are armed with machine guns that fire silver bullets.  The lycans are similarly armed, but use ultraviolet light-emitting bullets instead.  Whereas most of the lycans appear to have fighting skills, most of the vampires seemingly spend their time lounging about.  The film begins with a skirmish between Selene, who is accompanied by another Death Dealer, and two lycans who she discovers are following a human named Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman).  Michael escapes, but Selene becomes engrossed with understanding why the lycans are so interested in him.  With total disregard to leading vampire Kraven's (Shane Brolly) disapproval, Selene captures Michael, but the leading lycan, named Lucian (Michael Sheen), also catches up with him and bites him.  Hence, Michael begins to transform into a lycan, but Selene's continued interest in him develops into something else.  She also discovers a lot more about her own history, the history of vampires and lycans, Lucian's plans, and the leading vampire in which she places the greatest trust, Viktor (Bill Nighy).
Though the plot of ""Underworld"" is thin, it is unique in its portrayal of the relationship between the two popular mythological creatures of vampires and werewolves. The on-screen fights, special effects and action are entertaining, and the dark and nearly achromatic cinematography used nearly throughout the film's 121 minutes maintains an infernal atmosphere.  The off-screen action is also interesting as Michael Sheen is Kate Beckinsale's former boyfriend with whom she conceived a child several years ago, and she is now Len Wiseman's fiance.  Memorable on-screen scenes include the opening skirmish, Selene with Michael, skirmishes with Lucian, raising Viktor, and the last 30 minutes (or so) of the film.  Notable special effects include the werewolf transformations, Michael's transformations and the extra-human abilities that the vampires and werewolves have.  The most annoying character in the film is Kraven.
Overall, I rate ""Underworld"" with 3.5 out of 5 stars, rounded to 4 stars. From the film's ending, it is easy to deduce that a sequel may be in the works.",1075248000,4,2971,5.278131634819533

All these ingredients come together in Underworld, by first time feature dirctor Len Wiseman, and they mix up to offer you boring and somewhat stuipd movie.  And Kate still looks hot.
This isn't Wisman's fault.  His directing is good enough to give the movie it's artistic and style flare but it isn't good enough to save it.
The movie is simply to weighed down by, dumb f/x, a lame story that's been done before and better, a sorry excuse for a love triangle, and some only OK action sequences.
The action is what should have seld this movie.  This movie shares a lot from Blade.  Only where Blade one mixes a good solid story with cool people, Underworld fails.
Where Blade 2 pumps up the action, leading up to the most intense fights in recent action movies, Underworld simply falls flat.  Underworld does have its share of action but they simply don't do anything new, or anything that is heartpumping, nor anything that is simply cool.

Initially, I refrained from my attempt to turn off the player after 10 minutes, 20, 30; I had hoped that there was a good storyline in the end. Turns out, it wasn't so bad after all. I truly adored the Lycan attempt for peace by creating a hybrid species -- indeed, an attempt stemmed by the love between Lucian and Sonia, the vampyric daughter of Viktor. This melding is further paralled by the attraction (not really love) between Selene and Michael.
Unfortunately, I felt the story is muddied by the mortal battling with guns (although the speciess-specific bullets were a cool idea), and the overemphasis on the war. Selene's handguns sounding like AK47s were a little much. More time should have been spent on the history of the war: what few scenes shown were done so rather sketchily, with a purposed blur.
Kudos to Kevin Grevioux (Raze) for the genetic species idea (Kevin's genetic engr. background is indicated in the special features section) and to Michael Sheen (Lucian), who really has the only character that shows any emotion.

1947734,3,B0000UI2NM,"This is very ambitious film about vampires and werewolves. Apparently, vampires and werewolves (or ""lycans"" - apparently ""werewolf"" was too mundane a moniker for the filmmakers) have been warring with each other for centuries, right up to the present day. We get to see plenty of flashbacks throughout this historical war, and this sub-story is the best part of the movie. The rest consists of the modern-day adaptation of these creatures - vampires that make artificial blood, perform genetic experiments, and have computerized storage for the undead. In some respects this is interesting, since if these creatures did exist they would probably adapt in this way. But I was far more interested in the backstory, of which we see too little.
There's a weak love story, brought down by Kate Beckinsale's knock-off matrix performance - we've already seen the pouty, emotionless hot brunette in latex, haven't we? - and an interesting twist involving who the real bad guys are. But for the most part it's harmless action, peppered with peaks of an interesting story that's not fully developed. I recommend renting, not buying. It's not going to have much repeat watchability. Although the concept is interesting, it's not pulled off in a convincing way. It could have been much better with a more dynamic female lead, a bad guy who wasn't such a weanie (Michael Sheen as Lucian).",1074902400,,1375,5.035087719298246
1947735,3,B0000UI2NM,"The whole idea of this movie seemed to be create the perfect combination of ""The Matrix"" and ""Dracula"". In some ways this works, as there are some really good action scenes here, as well as the expected dark and rain that comes along with a movie like this. The story is based on an ancient war between vampires and werewolves that has been going on for thousands of years beneath the eyes of humanity. All this is quite interesting, as is the history of the war, and the way the vampires are ruled in shifts. This film does not lack in cool ideas, that is for sure, but like so many movies with a great idea, it becomes quite hard to follow through on it.
For an action movie, ""Underworld"" can be quite dull at times, and although the direction is good, the continual darkness gets old, and ends up making the viewer sleepy. As expected, the movie ends with a perfect opening for a sequel, something that we have become really used to with action movies of late, because the producers are always looking for sequel opportunities and the extra money that comes along with that.
The acting is good here, and Kate Beckinsdale is beautiful, but it is not enough to make you forget that there is something missing in this movie: wall to wall action and a couple of hours of entertainment.

1947737,2,B0000UI2NM,"I knew before even going into this movie that it would not be ""pure"" vampire type film. Still, to be disappointed on top of that was a big letdown. I love monsters. I love vampires. I love werewolves. I would have accepted this movie a bit more if they had left out the references to these classic fiends and created a whole different type of demonic bad guy that *should* use guns.
Insistance on using these two familiar and well loved creatures of the night was nothing more than a hook to draw in an audience; beyond that the people/creatures had no resemblnce whatsoever to the two legendary monsters. The mere idea of these supposedly vicious and blood/flesh hungry beasties running around shooting special guns at each other for no other reason than ""we are at war"" is as ludicrous as a starving man shooting a cow and not eating it.
Okay, the premise? Vampires and werewolves are at war, and we don't find out why until the end, which is nonclimatic and doesn't make any sense. There is one person on the earth that contains blood that the werewolves want, the vampires see the lycans chasing the human so they chase him down too. Yawn. That's it.
What I didn't like about the movie? Other than what I mentioned above, the plot was so thin you could read a newspaper through it. The script was horrible, and while the premise of a battle between vampires and werewolves would be very cool, you need to include some TEETH! It was as if the scriptwriters could not make up their minds whether to make anaction-shoot-em-up movie or a horror movie, and wound out with less than the sum of both.
In particular is a scene when Selena (Kate Beckinsale) drives her car into the water with Michael (Scott Speedman). He ""rescues"" her after she hits her head on the windshield and gets knocked out, pulls her from thewater, gives her CPR, after which she coughs out a little water and comes to. HELLO! Vampires are dead. They are not alive. They don't breathe. They don't have heartbeats. They can't be knocked out, and they can't drown. And after all this, Selena tells Kraven ""He saved my life."" Riiiiiiiight. What life? You're undead!
Another problem with the vampires was that they seem to have forgotten they can change into bats and fly away. Instead, they just stand there and let the werewolves chew them. With the werewolves, only Michael changes with the full moon (of course) but the other werewolves are changing back and forth like a malfunctioning traffic light. The special effects were mediocre; the turning of the werewolves was really no better han ""American Werewolf In London"", and all the fighting was so ""A-La-Matrix"" that for a moment I was confused as to which movie I was really watching.
Okay, so what DID I like about the movie? The acting was actually verye good. Kate Beckinsale, Scott Speedman, Michael Sheen, Shane Brolly, and especially Bill Nighy played their roles very well. The acting alone is the only reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1. It is a visually stylish movie as far as dress and scenery. I liked the idea of vampires and werewolves descending from one anscestor. I thought that Viktor's tomb was very cool, and the visual effects of the awakening of Viktor were pretty slick. I am glad that I rented before buying on this one. It just got scratched off my purchase list.

1947741,4,B0000UI2NM,"Underworld is an ambitious movie, but to appreciate it one needs to understand that it is the first installment in a trilogy.  Also, and this is important, Underworld tells a story.  I suspect that this will be a better story when all three parts of the trilogy are filmed and can be viewed in one sitting.
Perhaps a third of Underworld's two hours is no-holds-barred battle between Lycans and vampires, waged sometimes with stylish modern weaponry, sometimes with tooth and claw.  The remainder is exposition, back-story, character interaction and plot movement.  As a storytelling vehicle, conflicts rage on many levels through the film: a conflict between elder and younger vampires in the Covens; a conflict between Lycans and vampires; Selene's inner conflict as she reconciles her ages-old hatred of Lycans with her feelings for an innocent newly introduced to the Lycan-vampire blood feud and her unquestioning loyalty to a vampire Elder who had been like a father to her for centuries...
As a stand-alone film, Underworld is not perfect, but it is trying to do a lot in two hours: give us the back-story of the ancient feud between Lycans and Vampires; introduce us to the vampire Covens and the Elders <Michael, Amelia, Viktor>; introduce Selene and the Death-dealers, give us a glimpse into the Lycan culture; introduce us to Michael Corvin and Selene and Kraven and other notables; illustrate their strengths and weaknesses...
It succeeds in several interesting ways.  There is a point in the film where our understanding of who and what the principals are, our understanding of what motivates them, shifts.  This is the sort of thing that many who went to see the film will hate.  It's time spent away from the flash of claws and baring of teeth.  It is, though, very satisfying from a storytelling and character perspective.  It enhances Underworld's replay value, makes a second or third watching of the movie more interesting because characters we know from the first hour are more fully developed by the end of the film, and more interesting for it.
Underworld doesn't throw one side at another until one side 'wins'.  Underworld is several stories: a love story, yes, but more than that it is several characters' efforts to resolve an ancient conflict between Lycans and vampires, each in their own way.  We begin the film with Selene and her Death Dealer comrades looking down on their prey, each single-mindedly dedicated to hunting the Lycans down, one by one, until the last.  By the end of the film, Underworld has given us a glimpse into the true nature of the conflict and the true character of its principals.
In sum, what weakens the first film is what may make the trilogy interesting.  If Underworld had been non-stop battle, a second and third movie would feel more like installments in a franchise and less like what I think they will be: the middle and end-point in a six or seven hour story.
Final note: Casting was quite good with each character (Beckinsale's Selene, Speedman's Michael, Viktor, Lucian, et. al.) delivering a performance that matched their character nicely.  Special effects were also quite good.  The sound track tried a little too hard at points to give the film an edge, didn't always sync up.

The storyline sounds incredible. Werewolves (called ""Lycans"" in the film to make them sound cooler) vs Vampires? How much cooler can you get? Unfortunately, the coolness factor doesn't expand beyond the concept. Yes, the film does feature Lycans battling Vampires. Unfortunately, the only way you'd know this is by the occasional glimpse of teeth and shot of a full moon. They fight the entire movie with guns. I felt like I was watching a bad splice of The Matrix and Blade. What is the purpose of showing these two historical enemies fighting if they're going to be running behind each other with Uzis?
Almost no typical vamp/wolf lore was explored. The ONLY thing the vampires do to show they're vampires if bare their fanged teeth and can jump from big heights. They don't shy away from the sun, turn into bats, suck blood, or anything else which makes vampires cool. The film even refers to them at one point as ""bats"" yet you never see it.
Scott Speedman provides a forgettable performance for all of his 15-20 lines in the movie. The ending is VERY anticlimactic and is just a very watered down gun fight that would have been too boring to make it's way into The Matrix. I had to watch this film over 4 days because I kept falling asleep. What's more, the lycans looked absolutely ridiculous when they changed. The werewolves from ""The Howling"" 20 years ago had better make up.
In regards to the DVD, I had a few problems with it.  The film is very dark, mostly shot at night, in tunnels, or in the rain.  The sound was also poorly reproduced on the DVD.  I was constantly having to change the volume.  I would raise it for speech, and as soon as the action started, the sound would jump and I would have to lower it.  I realize something blowing up should sound louder, but not this loud, and the differences shouldn't be so high where I have to keep my finger on the volume button the whole film.
The extras on the DVD were fairly boring.  Some throwaways like trailers, teasers for other films, and a storyboard comparison, which no one ever cares about.  It also featured a montage of scenes from the movie set to music called ""Sights and Sounds.""  I don't know what this was or if it was supposed to be entertaining.
The featurettes contain a fairly poor ""Making Of"" special, a commentary with the director, and a special on the visual effects.
Overall, Underworld is a great concept, but the addition of guns and high tech weapons, as well as the idea to turn this into an action film instead of horror, ultimately cause it to fail.  The relationship between Beckinsale and Speedman is never explored beyond a single kiss, even though the film leads you to believe this is another ""Romeo and Juliet"" story...",1074470400,9,2914,4.567049808429119
1947744,1,B0000UI2NM,"In two words: moronic & pretentious. If I had to waste more words I'd say there was never a story here. The amount of time spent viewing this was excruciating - I stayed because of a friend. The plot isn't worth mentioning. The actors do nothing. My favorite scene was when some vampire jumps on top of a car and sticks a knife inbetween the driver and passenger side seats, like he thought someone might be there. This isn't Horror, this isn't smart, this isn't gothic, this doesn't deserve a sequel. I hated when 'Viktor' is revealed to be the badguy behind Selene's parents death, like it's a big revelation and we're all supposed to feel betrayed by this character or like anyone gave a damn.",1074470400,7,696,4.531746031746032
1947745,4,B0000UI2NM,"UNDERWORLD is being horridly underrated.  Those who were looking for ""Romeo and Juliet"" are furious.  I myself found the film to be better than I expected.  UNDERWORLD is an extraodinary BLADE-esque horror/thriller with similarities to both BLADE and THE MATRIX.  Kate Beckinsale plays Selene, a vampire ""Death Dealer"".  Her job is to eleminate any and all Lycans (werewolves), who have been at war with the vampires for a millenia.  But her determination wavers when she meets a newly-made Lycan (Scott Speedman) who has been unsuspectingly drawn into this ages-old battle.  Things aren't as they seem, or so Selene soon discovers; and thus begins one of the greatest battles of all history.  UNDERWORLD belongs in the rows of horror wonders.  It is outstanding.  The direction is terrific and occasionally artful; the soundtrack is good; the acting is great; and the effects are terrific.  The story is also an awesome idea and is brought out well.  There's also a very cool Lycan transformation scene reminiscent of AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON.  The only way to know how good the film is is to watch it.  I strongly recommend that you rent this horror wonder as soon as possible; believe me, it's worth it.  UNDERWORLD is one delicious bite of horror cinema that you'll be howling about for days on end.",1074470400,,1309,4.940366972477064
1947746,3,B0000UI2NM,"This film was fairly heavily panned by the critics when it opened in September 2003 and I feel undeservedly so, for it is a highly watchable, if uninventive piece of cinema.
Kate Beckinsale plays a Vampire whose job is to hunt and kill Lychens (Werewolves) the sworn enemy of her coven, and her kind. The film has a distinctly European feel, not only in the locations, but also direction but moves at a good pace, keeping the viewer awake and for the most part enthralled. A little heavy on the Matrix style fight sequences, with the usual ammunition flying in all directions, it is however, more than a reworked vampire tale of good vs evil, or eveil vs evil (whichever you take) - with a reasonably original storyline in what one has to say, is a highly competetive, and previously visited genre. Without giving too much away, the art direction is gothic but modern and the new Sfx meets old world macabre well, even if there aren't too many suprises along the way. A major plus is the non cliched and well defined beginning middle and end, and the very well handled ""human touch"" portrayed by the main characters in their fantasy roles. Highly enjoyable romp, with some nice extra's on the DVD, and certainly worth a second look.",1074384000,,1232,4.63013698630137

1947748,4,B0000UI2NM,"I missed this one when it was in the theaters and was patiently awaiting its arrival on the DVD racks and to say the very least, I was not disappointed by it.  ""Underworld"" is an outstanding, sleek action thriller with extremely dark undertones that I highly enjoyed watching.  The only detractor for me was the prosthetics and CGI used for the Lycans (werewolves).  Outside of that minor detractor, this films scores on all points, from the overall dark atmosphere to the story telling and to the acting.
While I've seen and read that the professional critics and many others have pretty much panned this movie, if you've not seen it yet, I urge you to give it an open minded try as I believe you will be as surprised by it as I was!  As far as stories go that involve vampires and werewolves, ""Underworld"" takes a completely new, intriguing and compelling approach that will hopefully spawn a sequel.
Prior to ""Underworld,"" the only movie I've ever seen Kate Beckinsale in was ""Pearl Harbor"" and I thought her performance in that film was, just what it was, a supporting role that was noticeable but not notable.  Her performance as the lead in an action film of this magnitude is, to say the least, incredible.  She is an extremely gorgeous woman and given the makeup and costumes she's wearing in this film, they only serve to greater enhance her beauty.  Her future performances are definitely to be looked forward to with anticipation.
This highly conceptual story was written by Kevin Grevioux, Len Wiseman and Danny McBride and directed by Len Wiseman.  All of which deserve high praise for their efforts in creating this new spin in the Vampire/Werewolves genre.  The score for the film greatly enhances the overall dark feeling of the movie!
The Premise:
Kate Beckinsale plays Selene, a vampire who is one of the lead warriors in the battle between the vampires and the Lycans (werewolves).  Known as a death bringer by the Lycans, she makes a disturbing discovery while on a mission to bring death to some of the Lycans, a discovery that will lead her down the path to of a highly adventuresome story that is extremely rich in its telling...
I highly recommend this film to any and all who are fans of films from this particular genre.  This new spin on the Vampires & Werewolves mythology and Kate Beckinsale's performance makes this film an instant classic in the genre!  {ssintrepid}

1947749,1,B0000UI2NM,"Words can't describe how lame this movie is.  Some movies can pull off a low budget and still look good, but this isn't one of them.  If you saw the commercial, you literally saw every special effects shot in the movie.  The story makes no sense whatsoever.  The concept of vampires and werewolves fighting each other with guns is pointless.  Why have monsters at all if everyone's just going to shoot at each other?",1074297600,6,416,4.5675675675675675
1947750,4,B0000UI2NM,"Many have voiced their opinions of this film.  I was hesistant to see this in theatres mainly because of them and I am (in a way) angry I listened to them.  Namely because this film would have been so cool to see on the big screen.  Visually, it's a feast of inspiration and a story that is literally told from a visual standpoint as well as a literal standpoint.  Bearing in mind the director has taken an age old concept and shaken it up a bit.
The premise is pretty simple, Vampires and Werewolves are at war with each other based on age old principles carried down from their ancestors.  One side believes one thing, the other side believes another.  All the while, they fight for something neither side really knows what or ""who"" they're fighting for.  This premise is sort of an analogy based upon our religious natures as humans.  For example, we have one side of humanity that says there is ""a god"" and one side that says there's just ""God,"" and the possiblity that neither side is right and that God simply is just folklore.  What we see in ""Underworld"" is a story of the persecution and the revelation of what real truth is.  The price you pay for that truth and possibilites of retribution.  Politics smear the facts, lies are told over centuries of war and doubt and Lycans are hunted, while Vampyre are thwarted.  Sounds familiar with what is going on our world I am afraid.  The problem is most people don't see things like that through a movie like this.  Most just see a movie like this as a simple action flick with really cool special effects.  This story is so much more than that.
Keep in mind when watching this film that the story is simply not just about Vampyre and Lycans but an analogy of things to come in our own world.  Much of this story shows how truth is often betrayed and manipulated over the cost of stepping out of the boundaries to a brave new world.  If you go into this movie thinking the female vampire and the male lycan are ""in love"" or have a steamy romance, you're far from the mark of this movie.  Someone wrote once this movie was a modern day ""Romeo and Juliet"" told from a Vampire/Werewolf perspective-WRONG AGAIN!  This movie has none of that!  Watch this movie and just open your mind to something different and beautiful and read into it as much as you can.  There's more truth to this story than what appears.",1074124800,3,2361,4.431554524361949
1947751,4,B0000UI2NM,"A good job of stretching the envelope on Vampire stories. It may not quite be up to the action in ""Blade"", but it certainly has a great storyline, interesting characters, good special effects, and hot music. I can see why some compared it to Blade and Matrix, minor costume and scene similarities does not however give reason to be negative. The story of an age old battle between Vampires and Werewolves unfolds gradually in a way that grabs our interests.
I ended up buying a used copy at Hollywood Video. I couldn't pass it up since in my humble opinion there haven't been enough decent Vampires movies in the last ten years, and this is worth seeing again and again. This may not quite stack up to the first Blade movie, but it is better than ""Blade II"" or John Carpenter's ""Vampires"" in my opinion. I think the 5 key roles were all well performed by Kate Beckinsale ""Saline"", Scott Speedman ""Michael"", Michael Sheen ""Lucian"", Shane Brolly ""Kraven"", and Bill Nighy ""Viktor"".
Definitely worth seeing. This movie grows on you the more you watch it. The first time I watched ""Resident Evil"" I thought it was good but it took multiple viewings to really appreciate it. This movie is the same way. Each time I see it I pick up something new and develop more respect for the acting and directing. DVD production values are excellent. Sharp picture and sound. Cool user menu graphics and interface. Includes commentaries, making of, trailer, and other extras.",1074124800,,1456,4.7362204724409445
1947752,4,B0000UI2NM,"""Underworld"" was released in the fall, which is appropriate, because it's like an autumn night. It's dark, it's cool, and at times, it can be rather cloudy.
The basic plot is straightforward. Vampires and werewolves war with each other, for an ancient, unknown reason. The vampires live in big mansions, the werewolves live in the sewers. Both sides have adapted to using modern technology in their quest to rid the Underworld of the other. Along the way, the Lycans are looking for a human that may hold the key to shifting the war in their favor.
On the positive side, this movie looks cool. The background, costumes, scenery, and music portray a dark, gothic world. The weapons are also sleek and stylish.
On the other hand, the acting is usually stale, and the plot gets bumpy and disjointed. And Kate Beckinsale does look cool, once you get finished laughing at the idea of her being an action heroine. (That's silly, sillier than Michael Keaton as Batman, but not as silly as Denise Richards as a nuclear scientist from ""The World is Not Enough."")",1074038400,9,1053,4.759562841530054
1947753,1,B0000UI2NM,"I had the poor judgment to watch Underworld last night. I'd say that it sucked big bags of furry rocks, but it wasn't nearly that good.
The Vampires and the ""Lycans"" (""werewolves"" for the rest of us) have been at war for a thousand years, or maybe six hundred, or maybe some other figure--it seems to vary as the movie goes on. Selene (played, without significanrt ocular discomfort, by Kate Beckinsale) is a ""Death Dealer"", a vampire who specializes in killing werewolves, a commoditiy of which the vampires believe--erroneously--that they may be running out.
It's difficult to tell the vampires from the werewolves through most of this. They all look pretty goth-y, they fight for the most part with automatic weapons, so it ends up looking more like some sort of addled cross between The Matrix and The Howling, with a soupcon of Blade thrown in for good measure. Sadly, the end result is vastly inferior to any of these.
The plot, such as it is, appears to involve werewolves who are after this particular human who is a descendant of the first immortal (from whose bloodline both werewolves and vampires apparently sprang); Selene sorta falls in love with this guy, and ends up saving him, frist from the werewolves, then from the other vampires, because the interim chief vampire has set up some sort of back-door deal with the presumed-long-deceased leader of the werewolves. Now, the real chief vampire gets woken from hibernation or something by Selene, and he sets out to destroy all the werewolves (including the guy who Selene has fallen for, since he got bitten by the leader of the wereewolves and is now on the hairy verge, if you will, of becoming a ""Lycan"" himself), except that the real reason for this war is that the chief vampire killed his own daughter because she fell in love with the self-same not-quite-dead-yet head of the werewolves...
If you feel as though this gives you some idea of what a muddled mess this is, you don't know the half of it.
There was a lot of chatter when this movie came out about the scenario having been ripped off from some RP game or other, and--especially listening to the dialogue--it's awfully easy to believe that this is the case. The lines tend to be vacuous, but delivered with unfailingly portentous tone. Everybody here sounds like a 14-year-old dungeon master. Direction seems to be virtually nonexistent; according to the credits, a Len Wiseman deserves the blame here. This is Mr, Wiseman's first directorial outing, and it shows all over. His previous work was apparently as a prop assistant on Independence Day and Stargate. That shows, too. How he got this job is a mystery. Hopefully, he won't get another.
Bottom line: a dreadful piece of crap. You'd get more out of this movie if you ate the DVD with maple syrup on it instead of watching it.",1074038400,7,2815,4.7586912065439675

Never during this movie was I bored. The action was surprising entertaining, and the film was shot beautifully (I LOVE the lighting!). The theme is also something I've never seen dealt with prior to this movie. 'Underworld' is by far my new favorite movie, & I have absolutely no regrets of purchasing this film without viewing it first in theatres. I anticipate a sequel, although I hope it doesn't follow the cliche and make a sequel that totally does the original no justice.

1947758,5,B0000UI2NM,"I can't really lump this in with all the Matrix reviews because there's so much more to the plot in this one that it makes you forget the fact that there is some Matrix-type fight scenes in it. To put it straight to the point: if you loved The Crow, but thought of how much more could have been in that Goth classic, then get into this right away.
 Yeah, almost everyone had black trenchcoats on, there's a constant gloomy atmosphere (which I loved), and although Kate Beckinsale looks killer sexy in the black latex ..., she is a much better female hero of the movie than say, Angelina Jolie runnning around in the Tomb Raider movies.
 The effect as far as the battle between vampires and werewolves was excellent. Top notch special effects here-be sure to watch the bonus features to see the making of the werewolves-and the plot unwinds at a good pace, actually making you wait until the end to have it all reveal itself to you as you're caught up in all the action, horror, and fast paced scenes.
 Anyone into anything Gothic, horror related, and even action fans, don't let this one slip by you. It's the best movie I've seen in a long time. I bought it the day after renting it.
 And again, another plus to Kate Beckinsale for being the sexiest woman in tight latex, kicking ass with not one, but two guns! (And yes, the ending does hint at a sequel? I hope.)

1947761,2,B0000UI2NM,"After the first twenty minutes of the movie, I thought perhaps that I was in for a treat.  Unfortunately, the film's first reel contains the best footage (which was mined thoroughly for the trailer), and the final hour and a half lead the viewer through a somewhat convoluted history of the blood feud between the vampire clan and the lycans.  The filmmakers clearly had a vision here, but they waited too long to introduce the exposition as to why the feud exists in the first place, and by the time they did, I had largely lost interest.  At one point, I looked at the counter on my DVD player and realized that, after 45 minutes, I still did not have a clear idea of what motivated these two supernatural clans to go after each other.  At that point, I began to question my own motivation for watching the film...
Unlike other movies in the vampire tradition where vampires are being hunted for the sake of human survival (e.g., Blade), we do not learn until much later in the film why it is that these two groups hate each other so much.  Sadly, by the time we find out, we don't really care.
The only redemption for this movie is that Kate Beckinsale is stunning as the vampire death-dealer Selene.  Her presence is the only thing that keeps this from being completely unwatchable.

Yes the actions scenes are slowed down while a dark blue tinged, protruding, picture carries you through a film of gunfire, some martial arts, and rain.  A very gothic movie.
Despite the comparisons, watch with an open mind, because the concept is very unique, and the story is intresting and smart.  One idea they must've have stolen from Blade or other movies with gun firing vampires is a silver nitrate bullet.  But, who ever said vampires were allergic to silver?  Werewolves are!
Please, watch this movie with an open mind, and don't be turned off by the influences of the Matrix and Blade because you will not be able to appreciate what could be an awesome movie, I can't wait til a sequel comes out.
Like many other men watching this movie I sat down hoping for gore, body parts flying, and maybe a nude scene from Kate Beckinsale, HEY do not watch it hoping for that, you will get blood, you will get a hot herioin in black latex, and you will get an awesome story with serious acting, more convincing and real dialogue than the dead faced Matrix, and better ideas and concepts than Blade.

Vamps aren't real and neither are Lycans and even if they were this is just a movie! Why do so many people nitpick stuff just because they didn't follow the classic rules? Who cares it isn't a remake of Dracula or any of the shlockey 1950's werewolf films it is its own creation and so they used what they wanted to use and made up new ideas that were creative and exciting.
If this were a remake of a classic book or movie then I could understand all the criticisim but get real folks, or perhaps I should say get unreal! LOL You are all taking a piece of fiction way too seriously and need to relax and enjoy the new ideas that these excellent filmamakers devloped for this film.
If everything always followed the rules set down by earlier writers/myths then nothing new would ever be written or filmed!!!

1947765,4,B0000UI2NM,"Underworld, for those not in the know, is a Vampires vs. Werewolves (Lycans) movie. My first initial reaction to it when I saw the previews on TV were, ""Oh no! Not another Matrix ripoff!""
The scene where Kate Beckinsale's character shoots through the floor to drop down to the floor below it, as well as the shoot out in the subway, scream ""Matrix"". The sad thing is that those two scenes alone almost do an injustice to the movie for those that have not truely given it a chance. Other than those two scenes, the movie itself is NOT a Matrix ripoff. It only borrows some ideas from the Matrix series.
I'm glad that I finally went and purchased the DVD and watched the movie. It was refreshing and a twist in the plot had me going.
Underworld has a story line to it, unlike Matrix Reloaded (which I still enjoyed, BTW). Rather than throwing in a lot of action and trying to weave a story into it, this movie has a story with the action supporting the story. The darkness of the sets helps to bring out the broodishness of the war between the two factions. In many respects, it reminded me of The Crow and the first two Batman movies, giving a Gothic feel to it, which sets the tone for the movie.
For fans looking for a fast-paced action movie, you might want to look elsewhere. This movie is more about a war between two factions that hate each other. At first, you are given the belief that there is no known reason for the war except that there is an extreme hatred between Vampires and Lycans, but clues are given as the movie advances and the real reason will eventually be revealed, and for me, it was out of left field! Who do you root for? The Vamps or the Lycans? You decide!
The only problem I have is that the Vampires cast reflections! For me, that is such an integral part of the Vampire lore, but I can overlook it in this case. Also, it might seem weird with Vampires and Lycans shooting at each other, but the ammunition is not your standard grade of ammo. It's actually ingenious with the types of ammo they came up with for this movie. Why shouldn't the Vampires and Lycans be with the times? Better to use the technology at hand I say to give yourself an advantage. Besides, this ISN'T Buffy the Vampire Slayer, another one of my favorites (the TV series, that is!)
The ending seems to leave room for a sequel. However, I think it might be best left alone and we are left to just wonder what is to become of the war between the Vampires and the Lycans.",1073952000,2,2471,4.316129032258065

Adding to the stupidity, the Vampires shoot silver nitrate bullets, and the Lycans shoot (I'm not joking here, folks) daylight bullets! The acting is rather hammy. The dialogue is such a waste, many times it really seems as though it is simply there to fill time. I will admit that the movie got better as it went on, and in the end, I would call it midly entertaining. Really, though, nothing more than a hybrid of The Matrix and The Crow movies.

1947767,5,B0000UI2NM,"I want to begin with 'Underworld' is not for everyone. It is hightly specific for a certain kind of audience. The audience that knows the rules and behaviors of Vampires and Werewolves, because they don't go into detail about that in the movie.  Not everyone will love it, but to those people who love vampire, werewolf, myth movies, (myself included), it was great!!!
One of the first to combine the unlikely combinations of Vampires vs. Werewolves ( or Lycon as in the movie ).  The story was true to many beliefs (Vampires are stuck-up upper class, and werewolfs are more savage) and explored a plot line that revolves around inter-species connections.
It was fanastic, the movie was very well done, with the color palette being a mix of dark blues, and gloomy atmospheres.  It was something out of movies like 'From Hell' and 'Interview from a Vampire'.  The actors were of course not all that good, but hey, what actors are really good in movies now a days? The heroine, Celine was good for the part in looks, and her counterpart, Micheal was not a bad match either.  They seemed compatable, but not to flashy in the romantic department, which was nice for the action-lovers, but a little lacking for a vampire movie.
Whatever you are looking for in this movie, its there and i, along with hopefully many other fans, will be looking for a sequel or two to this mysterious and cryptic story.",1073865600,,1395,4.677551020408163
1947768,4,B0000UI2NM,"I have read all kinds of vampire books (and a few on werewolves) and it seems though some authors tend to stick to the same existance for both (no reflection, holy water, silver bullets), it always seems nice to me to either read a story or see a movie that is courageous enough to be different and to create their own rules.  I didn't see Underworld as a love story (I guess the love between Lucien and Viktor's daughter could seem that way) and the funny thing is after it was over and my husband asked me what I thought, I told him ""It wasn't gory at all but it had to have blood in it since it was about vampires and werewolves"" and then I watched the movie, and one of the people said a similar thing so I guess I got what they were trying to do.  I was amazed that there were REAL people in those werewolf suits (I wish they would have gotten a real person to play the Hulk but that is a whole nother issue) because they wanted the audience to see how real looking they could be made to look.  I was facinated by the way Michael looked after Lucien told Selene to bite him and what happened afterwards.  Even though they didn't show the vampires actually taking blood from people, I think they were actually drinking blood at one point in the movie (or at least it looked like a red colored substance in glasses).  There are so many ways of writing a story like this and I believe a good job was done in the making of the movie from the settings, (being so dark and gloomy - the movie IS called Underworld) the thirst (excuse the pun) for power, a struggle (that was based on a lie) between two species and an ending that leads me to believe that there will be a second Underworld.",1073865600,,1687,4.178461538461539

Werewolves and Vampires have been locked in a battle that has lasted for centuries.  If this movie is taken at face value and simply enjoyed as a violent, gothic horror story, then it is very entertaining.  The problems arise when I noticed plot flaws and/or parts of the story that were mentioned early then completely forgotten by movie's end.  Also, there are scenes stolen nearly frame-for-frame from ""The Matrix.""  Kate Beckinsale, dressed in black latex and wet leather, could very well be Trinity's younger sister.  While I first scoffed at this thievery, I then realized that although they were stolen, they were also pulled off professionally.  I also noticed that the sun never rose during the course of the movie, which conjured images of another gothic-tinged film, ""Dark City.""  Some of the acting is sub-par, but this film is not meant to challenge the Oscars for acting achievement.  It is an action film with blood and violence and, to my absolute surprise, a good story.",1073865600,,1090,4.945054945054945
1947771,4,B0000UI2NM,"I enjoyed this movie, why not I like movies about vampires and wearwolves.  This one has a lot of familiar looks and action.  For some it might be too familiar as it simulates a bit of matrix in its look and style.  There is a tail about love and the cause for the war beginning that seems could have been played up more and you really don't quite get what its all about until you reach the end of the movie.  All through the movie you do seem to be left hopeing for more action and chemistry between the two main characters, and yet you can almost understand the hesitations.
The movie moves along quickly and smoothly enough though that any disappointment in the lack of chemistry displayed between them doesn't seem to bother you much.  It doesn't drag on and on like some reviewers might make you think.

the thing that kind of threw me was why no female wearwolfs.
It could have had a little more original style and costumes, but it was still a good movie.",1073779200,,961,4.340782122905028

Special effects are very good, but even that can't save a dull script and the slow pacing.
There's an old maxim in the theatre that goes, ""If it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage.""  If the script isn't compelling to read, no amount of spiffy set dressing, effects, etc will elevate it to a higher level.  Same here with ""Underworld"".  It looks good, but the script anchors it down to sub-par level.

I only gave this movie one star because i had too, It was some of the worst acting i have ever seen, The Werewolves looked stupid/retarted. Kate Beckinsale was the only good thing about this movie and not because of her acting. If you haven't seen this bore don't waste the time or your money like i did.
Overall I can sum this movie up in one word.....SUCKED!!!!",1073779200,2,516,4.17
1947774,4,B0000UI2NM,"Underworld is a stylish, gory, action filled horror movie, based on three premises.  The first is Vampires vs. Werewolves--an intriguing idea.  The second is that the audience has been raised on videogames and wants that kind of constant action--debatable as to whether this is helpful or not, but it sure keeps the movie going so you don't really have time to think.  The third, and most unfortunate, is that The Matrix is ripe for plucking.
I admit to enjoying Underworld quite a bit, but the entire look of the movie (except, of course, the Werewolf transformations, which were inspired by The Howling) was hauntingly familiar--it's all Matrix, from the costuming to the choreography, the cinematography, the lighting....superbly done, but blatantly stolen.  And with costuming and set design, I suppose that's forgivable, but relying on Matrix for more than that derailed the initial premise too much.
Within the first ten minutes I asked myself a question I'd return to over and over: ""Why are vampires and werewolves in human form shooting at each other--and missing?""  I really wasn't expecting so much gunplay (and martial arts) in a Vampire/Werewolf movie, and I think the film was the worse for it.  We've seen it all before, it advanced the plot not at all, and seemed grossly out of place for the genre.  The real interest in Vampires vs. Werewolves would be how they physically matched up--and when the film did develop this, it was really unique, with Vampires more agile but incapable of flight or shapeshifting, and Werewolves slower but vastly more powerful.  I personally had no interest in who could outshoot the other, and couldn't quite understand why that played such a huge part in the film.  Furthermore, another unfortunate question popped up:  ""How do those guns contain a seemingly infinite number of bullets?"" {See premise 2, above--only once in the movie did someone run out of bullets, only a few times was there reloading, but billions and billions of bullets, and lots and lots of missing...this was dumb as far back as Rambo.}
Plotwise, though, the Vampires vs. Werewolves idea worked well, and was developed in an interesting and unexpected fashion.  Acting was quite good, with a touch of overacting to be expected from such a topic, and the casting excellent.  Kate Beckinsale, as Trinity, er, no sorry, as the vampire Selene, and Scott Speedman as Neo, oops, I mean Michael, are both gorgeous and convincing.  I was taken aback a bit by Beckinsale's resemblance to Michael Jackson at his most feminine, though...
Anyway, in spite of its flaws, it's certainly entertaining and worth watching, at least once.",1073779200,3,2643,5.020594965675057
1947775,5,B0000UI2NM,"This was an great story and it was backed with special Effects that was not over played. The thing that made this movie stand from The Matrix was the special effects accaully. This movie was not over played with two hours of bullet time or panscan (the effects where the fighters jump up and freeze in the action)  fight sequences. There was alot of slow motion fights though(not the same as panscan).The story line drove this movie quite nicely. The story line is not good vs. evil but evil vs. evil. This movie was filled with alot of curve balls but some parts where predictable also. This was still an entertaining movie and one of the best films,in my opinion, of 2003. The start of the movie starts with in your face action which pulled me in from the start. The action is great and only stops for a little bit to make the story line cohesive.
  The special effects  of the transformation of the wherewolves where well done and not over blown. The vampires did not have much to change but I felt that it was good enough for the feel of the movie.
In Short:
This is a film for more of the ""Goth Thriller Action"" fans. I loved it and thought it to be pretty original in its own right.

I don't mean that in a demeaning way.  I rate her character right along side that of Ellen Ripley ""Alien(s)"" etc, and that is high praise for a first outing in strong action heroes. Ms Beckinsale is strong, sexy, smart and wow, what an outfit.  She also give a classic style gothic character portrayal of a woman not to be babied or toyed with.  The concept was fresh also.  In a world of two evil titans I felt sorry for the Lycans and the end sequence gave a grim situation a spark of hope as well as a great setup for a sequel.  Speedman was an incredible portrait of a combination Lycan/Vampire that was powerful, sleek and handsome.  The special effects and makeup departments worked over-time on this one and it showed.  Instead of a lot of CGI creatures, I was very excited by the return to the human influence in the creatures.  The suits and animatronics added a 3-D effect that sold me on this movie.

Usually I'm complaining because of threadbare plots in most action movies, but UNDERWORLD may have actually tried to put too much plot in.  Kate Beckinsdale's character should have had much more screen time--or at least more character development.
A lot of cool special effects so early on made the film peak too soon and the middle section sags with hardly a werewolf transformation to be seen.  (A friend showed up after I'd watched the first 20 minutes or so and sat down to see a werewolf--then said ""Finally!"" when one happened near the end).
Although the film was marketed as a ""Romeo and Juliet"" type of love story, that aspect barely exists as you watch it.  When the Vampire girl kisses the human guy, you're left wondering, ""Where'd that come from?""  It's the least developed motivation in the movie when it should've been the first.
Since it's always dark and raining, I can throw another movie on the pile that UNDERWORLD looks a little too derivative of: a Goth version of BLADE RUNNER.  (Everyone else has already mentioned BLADE, THE MATRIX, etc).",1073606400,,1219,4.813397129186603

1) It's stylish, dark and gothic to the hilt (for people who love that kind of thing).

4) There's plenty of special features including 4 documentaries and 2 commentary tracks.
Worst:
1) You may, like some, think that it's TOO similar to other high-budget films (like ""The Matrix"", ""Blade"" & ""The Crow"").
Recommendation:
If you really like vampire and werewolf movies, this film adds yet another twist to the old legends. If you liked the the slickness of ""The Matrix"" and the savageness of ""Blade II"" (the films I think it's most like), then I'm willing to bet you'll like this one too.

The movie is hard to follow somtimes though. It throws too much at you in one movie and it becomes to complexed to follow. Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman (Felicity) don't really have great chemestry either eventhough they are good in their roles.

She handles the role well even if she comes off as more of a super model with attitude than a vampire. Anyway I always wanted to see a vampires vs werewolves movie and we get that with Underworld. There's not really enough action with them verse each other though. Yes they shoot at each other but I'd rather see more of them actually fighting. It's still pretty cool though.

The ""Vampire clans,"" the look of the vampires and the action scenes have all been done before in better movies.
The ""Vampire Clans"" idea has been done before in ""Kindred The Embraced,"" ""Blade,"" and several ""White-Wolf"" roleplaying games. The action sequences were unoriginal and uninspired and the clothes that the Vampires wore were just too stereotypical.

My main complaint was that of charater development, especialy regarding the 2 leads whom were supposed to have some sort of emotional attachment/connection.  The problem was that they never spent enough time, or dialog, together to develop the bonds that were needed by the end to explaine the things.  She was supposed to fall head-over heels for him, give up all she was raised to belive, etc, etc, etc, (don't want to ruin too much if you haven't seen it yet), yet I think she spent more screen time walking though doorways (entrances and exits) than she did with the other romantic lead.  Don't get me wrong, I like Kate Beckinsale in tight leather walking away from the camra as much as the next guy, and I look forward to timming things out when I get the DVD, its just with a little better editing and the addition of a scene or two this movie could have been one of the better ones, and deffinatly would have gottne another star.",1073174400,,1133,4.534313725490196

One of the most popular of Shakespeare's plays, Romeo and Juliet, has been transformed into many different feature films; some good (the 1968 version) and some bad (the 1996 version starring Leonardo DiCaprio). But the main point is that this enduring tale of two star-crossed lovers (which, in reality, Shakespeare ripped off) has been able to stand the test of time, be passed on to future generations and has been embraced as much as it has ever been. Now a more different (really different) version has emerged with werewolves and vampires taking the place of the feuding families the Montagues and the Capulets. But Screen Gem's gothic take on the famous tale is much more loosely based then previous versions. How loosely based? At press time there was already talk of a sequel. William Shakespeare must be rolling in his grave right now.
Underworld is loosely based on Romeo and Juliet with werewolves and vampires, two feuding clans, battling for supremacy. Selene, a vampire, is a ""Death Dealer"", an armed assassin who hunts down the Lycans, also known as werewolves. For centuries the war between the vampires and the Lycans has been raging on outside of the knowledge of the human race but that may all change with new rumblings in the underworld. Selene soon becomes infatuated with a human named Michael, who becomes the focus of a secret plot by the Lycans to resurrect their dying species. Why is this such a big deal? The integration of these two rivaling species is strictly forbidden but such an event could end the war. Why would anyone not want this? Selene believes that there are secrets within both clans that push the classic theme of appearance vs. reality. The story of Underworld is intriguing to say the least but gets too caught up in itself to make truly any sense. There are many surprising twists and turns in the plot but so many that the feature becomes bogged down and just plain confusing by the end of its two hour run. And talk about being ""loosely"" based! The filmmakers claim that Underworld is based on Romeo and Juliet with two members of feuding clans coming together in blissful love but outside of that, the similarities end pretty quickly. And even that similarity isn't well based with any romantic interests between the two main characters being pretty flat and disconnected.
The cast is full of wonderful actors and actresses but few famous faces to bring in even a built in audience. Kate Beckinsale, who saw her star power rise dramatically after her role in the 2001 hit Pearl Harbor, is obviously the main focus of the feature and does a wonderful job with her time in the spotlight or lack of light. Beckinsale gives an uber-sexy performance as Selene that may give another leather clad actress, Carrie-Ann Moss, a run for her money in that area. The only problem with her character is that little detail is given to her character's past and even when those details are available, they aren't explored in flashback sequences, which would have relieved some confusion in the plot. Scott Speedman, best known for performance on the late Felicity series on the WB television network, does a best a performance as he can give but as important as his character is to the plot of the film, he really isn't given anything to show off his true acting chops. Bill Nighy, who plays the ancient vampire leader Viktor, gives an entertaining performance that was still quite interesting despite the fact that he doesn't appear till relatively late in the film. The only upsetting fact of the character is the way he dies, which seemed like a slap in the face to the fine performer who worked so hard to set up an engaging character only to be kicked down so quickly.
Overall, Underworld is an insult to the famous play on which it is based, no matter how loosely it is. Poor William Shakespeare must be rolling in his grave! The idea seemed to an interesting one, so what went wrong? A lot of things. Despite having a decent two hour time length, Underworld becomes too bloated by the midway point that by the end, it just gives up and rolls downhill. The plot has too many twists and turns to get a clear understanding of what is going on and ends with more questions then answers. How did the vampires and werewolves start out? How were the werewolves able to evolve so that they could change at random? Why is it the werewolves and vampires seem to have this all out war against each other going on for centuries without the knowledge the human race? Some of those answers may be present in the feature but the main focus becomes so confusing that anything else is pushed out of your mind to even ponder. And even though this is a horror/monster film, Screen Gem could have taken the blood factor down a notch or two as there were too many unnecessary squeamish moments for some to take especially after gobbling down a full bucket of popcorn. The action sequences are well done, though the filmmakers seem to borrow too many elements from The Matrix series to make them even slightly original. So despite an excellent performance by Kate Beckinsale and well choreographed action sequences, Underworld comes off as being too long, grim and confusing to recommend above superior fall fare like Once Upon a Time in Mexico.",1073088000,,5419,4.716244725738397
1947799,5,B0000UI2NM,"long a fan of the horror genre, specifically the vampire/werewolf/zombie (did you catch 28 days? i saw it at sundance in 2003, and was wowed; even more when it came into wide viewing, and later on, pay ver view, and dvd); i am always looking for the new vision, the new take, new complications, chapter endings, or borrowing to fit a new blend of the horror symbolism and mythology. we can all imagine our own take on the vampire story, especially if you have ever played magic games, read ann rice, did live and online role playing, or even spiced up your celebration of the day of the dead. the same goes for movies about mars, the red planet. i have found it worthwhile to build a collection of the different actors, screenplays and directors visions of whom and what the vampire and werewolf are. this movie was no exception--for me, it was the the edgy future of the vampire movie, complete with open endings for new chapters, that appealed to me. learning that the director vision is derived from his previous music video work, my expectations when i went into the theater was met ---matching some of my own personal colors and imagined faces and interactions in fantasy. Kate Beckinsale became my new heroine, and easily i could imagine myself as her character--wanting to know more, wanting to do more, ""on a mission"" . what story of life interupted for a mission is not interesting, or secretly wondered about and even desired?
since i am disabled, going to the movie theater is a logistic that required patience and co-operation from my fellow attendees. i insist on getting there early, and sitting where i want to sit, not where the theater would like to 'assign' me, which is often the least likely place to view a movie. at this viewing, when i went early, i met other people with the same expectations, already fulfilled from the trailers--to enjoy and relish the visuals and new take on this story. i spoke with several other moviegoers before the before previews came up, whom were there for their second or third time. This director has a following for his work. it helps that the screen play worked too. this was well worth the effort and time to see the feature, several times, and to invest in the dvd, for the extra features, music video, and other additional footage. this goes on the shelf with the others in the collection of my home dvd library and books on the subject.",1073088000,,2396,4.626760563380282
1947800,4,B0000UI2NM,"This is the MOST original Vampire movie I have seen in years.  Set in a dark present-day metropolis, the story asks the true film noir question: what is the right thing to do, and is the price worth it?  Using elements familiar to anyone who likes action movies, Underworld goes in a different direction.
The story is, at its heart, a story about consequences.  The female lead, Selene, is a vampire who serves her people without question - until a rebellion begins that could threaten their entire way of life.  Combined with the external threat of the Lycan werewolf clans (lycan is short for lycanthrope, or shape-changer), Selene must make very hard decisions over what side she will take, decisions that she later comes to regret.
What I liked most about this movie was the way Director Len Wiseman re-interpreted th legends surrounding Vampires and Werewolves.  Instead of re-creating the same, boring villains from storybooks a hundred years old, these creatures are caricatures of humanity.  Their powers are not simply fantastic abilities that make them horrible boogeymen.  Their supernatural qualities are used intelligently, to emphasize their humanity and hold a mirror up in front of our face.  The brute strength, tenacity and macabre medicinal practices of the Lycans are all too familiar qualities of the real-life downtrodden, as is the sneering, anemic, but all-too-real power of the Vampire overlords.
In response, some have approached me and said ""But that is not how Vampires and Werewolves work!  They are supposed to do <<insert x neat thingie here>>, and they never do!""  To this, I reply ""Why should they?""  This is not White Wolf's ""World of Darkness"" setting, nor is it an Ann Rice novel.  While those two settings are quite good, and I like them personally, there is no hard and fast rule that says every interpretation must be the same; in fact, some would say that a new interpretation is better art, because it takes risks.
In the end, this is the true strength of Underworld.  Wiseman takes risks - with the setting, with the effects, with the characters, and with the story.  In doing so, he manages to make Underworld more than just the sum of its familiar action-adventure components, and turn it into a film that makes you think.  While it is certainly not a classic film epic, it is a rock-solid movie that easily deserves 4 stars.",1072828800,3,2369,4.8875
1947801,1,B0000UI2NM,"An utter waste of time. Save your money. I saw this on the big screen at a second run theatre. As I LOVE vampire movies, this sounded so promising...a sexy, high-style love story between a vampire girl and werewolve boy. Well, the PR people deserve a bonus for coming with THAT hogwash! Be forewarned: this isn't ""Buffy"" and there is no romance here at all. I don't think the characters hardly touched, let alone have a ""love affair"". One minor character appears to have had an interspecies romance in the far past, but it's not gone into. Set in England (or somewhere), it's very hard to tell, but most of the Eurotrash looking actors have British accents.
Every cool movie of the last decade is mined here -- the bleak, colorless noir of ""The Crow"", the wire-work stunts and long leather coats of ""The Matrix"", the kick ass action of both ""Blade"" films, the vampire ""king"" from ""Interview with the Vampire"" and every Anne Rice novel ever written -- but to absolutely no effect. What plot there is, is nearly incomphrensible. The general principles of vampirism or werewolvism are disregarded...werewolves change at whim, and both silver bullets and daylight no longer work as in traditional tales.
Kate Beckinsale, a fine young actress, is wasted in this garbage. What on earth could have convinced her to take this part? At least she looks great, wearing Michelle Pfieffer's catsuit from ""Batman"". Every one else in the film is so pitifully incompetent that it would add further injury to even name them. Trust me, this won't appear on anybody's resume.
By midway, I was nodding off. If I'd been at home, I am sure I would have fallen asleep. One boring shoot out after another, often with very unclear results. The ending clears up nothing whatsoever about the ""plot"", which is nearly nonexistent.
This is one of the worst movies I saw in 2003, and possibly the worst vampire/werewolf movie ever made. Abbot and Costello meet Dracula is Oscar material in comparison with this howling dog. AVOID AT ALL COSTS, even if it shows up on cable.",1072742400,7,2042,4.771186440677966

This is a dark film that doesn't rely on CGI wizardry to the extent that others of its kind do.  No one watches these kinds of films for Oscar acting.  These kinds of films are action mood pieces, period.  They can either be good or bad and it's that simple.  Underworld is just plain good, utilizing some seriously creative ideas, one of which I have never seen or expected (the idea of mixing a vampire with a werewolf, oh yeah, I felt the love too).  Great storytelling.  Great original characters.  Awesome use of color/tint.  I expect a sequel but I'm hopefull that they don't use more money the next time like so many other sequels.

This movie gives me a whole new image about vampires and their rival, werewolves.  Most of the time, vampires are villains and now they are the good guys.  The plot I like the most is the character, ""Lucian"" is not as bad as I think at the end of the movie.  He wants to fight back vampires because of revenge.
Kate Beckinsale is so cool in this movie, especially after watching her in ""Pearl Harbour"".  I cant imagine she can play this character that well.
Last but not the least, its a really good movie about vamps and werewolves even lots of people complained that this movie is a blend of ""Matrix/Crow/Blade"".  Sometimes ""blending"" can make good movies.",1072656000,,929,4.526946107784431
1947804,2,B0000UI2NM,"Underworld had some okay potential. Vampires versus Werewolves is an intriguing concept. And the movie has plenty of style. However, the director or someone else screwed up along the way.
This movie has no plot until about two thrids of the way through. The Vampires are little more than eurosnobs -- some with guns, most just lounging about in formal evening wear. An ancient vampire later says their clan has turned weak. What an understatement -- they lost all interest for me when they go running up stairs, guns in hand, and flahslights on their heads. Um, don't vampires usually see in the dark and fly and attack viciously with their fangs?!?
The werewolves are little more than a mob gang of long-haired muscled men.
After the plot develops, its a much better film, but until that point it's a total throwaway. Apparently, the director wanted to make a star of the lead actress' boots, because there's way too many shots of them landing from jumps and falls.
I hate it when people talk through a movie, but we all were cracking jokes through it because it was purely silly and there was little story line or dialogue worth paying attention to.",1072656000,,1151,4.702970297029703

Now I did like the silver nitrate bullets but vamps with guns???  They looked more like Matrix-wannabes than the living dead to me.  There was no show of their ""otherworldly"" powers until towards the end of the movie.  And even that showing of power was ""weak"" for lack of a better term.
The lycans, on the other hand, were awesome!!!  Being a huge fan of the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, series I often sided with the vamps and looked down on the whining, wimpy lycans but I definitely was cheering the lycans on in this movie.  Their leader, Lucien, was definitely running things and as his story was revealed, we learned that underneath all the fangs and fur was a real romantic.  Moving on....
The special effects were pretty good.  All in all, the movie was worth watching but I'd think twice about making it a part of my dvd collection.  Had there been more of a showing of supernatural stand-offs and such, I might have been persuaded differently.

1947809,1,B0000UI2NM,"I had walked into the movie theatre (when the film was originally released) and had only hopes for teriffic-looking costumes.
The story is not unoriginal, but rather it is unintentional drivel.  It does not contain a solid style, nor does it contain fluidity.
The story (promised by the commercials) is about a Romeo and Juliet-like vampire and warewolf flick, but the delivery simply had vampires who hunt warewolfs (and vice versa).
The vampires were very boring and looked bored.  They all just sat around a loung, inside a fancy Victorian-age mansion and were wearing clothing suitable for the victorian age (with the exceptional trench coat and leather jacket.  I would have liked seeing the outfits if only the film did not cut away from that scene after two seconds.
The warewolves live underground and constantly beat eachother up.  I did not bother asking for a reason.
Somewhere in the film's ""plot"" is a conspiracy that dates a few thousand years back and makes the vampires look like bad guys.  How can you choose sides between vampires who carry a reflection in the mirror and DO NOT drink blood (throughout the entire film) and warewolves and beat up the vampires as if they were mere humans?
To sum up my review (and you may notice that I did not give away the plot, but simply something of the ""story"") there is only one vampire in the film.  He is a ressurected elder who sucks blood, weilds a sword, dresses appropriately, takes initiative, and has, get this: super human strength!
This was a horrid film, and to top it off it was actually LACKING style, predictable, and boring.

1947813,3,B0000UI2NM,"""Underworld"" has two great things in it; beautiful images and elegant Kate Beckinsale.  Period.  Except for them, you get nothing particularly special about it -- the actions are not new, the acting is not good, and most of all the story is very slow-moving and uninvolving.
""Underworld"" is, some say, the Romeo and Juliet story in vimpire/werewolf version.  This account is quite misleading.  It is about Ms Beckinsale's Selene, deadly assassin with guns among the vampire clan.  They are fighting the bloody war so long with the now-outnumbered werewolves (Lycans, they are called), so no one remembers the original cause of the war.  So, Selene is told to kill, and she kills.  So far so good.
And the opening subway gun-shooting scenes are reasonably done.  And Scott Speedman's doctor named Michael enters as the possible target of the Lycans.  Selene only seems aware of the fact that Michael has some secret he doesn't know, but the leader of the Lycans (Michael Sheen) is desperately after.  Now the plot is going to thicken.
But it doesn't.  Soon we get confused because of the very clumsy storytelling, i.e. talk, talk, talk, which includes many monologues, intricate relations of characters, and some ritualsa and traditions about the dynasty of old, sleeping vampires.  Some are intrigued by these webs of facts, but I must say ... Isn't this supposed to be Romeo and Juliet?
The director Len Wiseman unaccountably doesn't show any interest in the relations between Beckinsale and Speedman.  This misguided choice kills any potential power they might have been given; instead, we start to lose interest in them.  How should we care these uninteresting characters?
If you have seen ""Blade"" ""Blade 2"" or the first ""Crow"", don't expect the actions, which lack originality.  Not that they are bad -- far from it.  But the fact remains that we have seen more exciting and unique ones in them, and to make matters worse, for all the inclusion of creature designer Patrick Tatopoulos, the werewolves are not convincing.
We got good production designs including the cobbled streets of Budapest; we got credible and often very sinister atomospher.  Still we need more power, or elegance, or humor, or anything here, which might heighten the tension between the two clans.

Those were DRAMAS. One of my friends said to me ""I wanted more 'Interview...' and this is totally unfair. The trailer told you what this film was about. It's about a war between vampires and Lycans (warewolves). It has guns, fighting and a love story subplot. It's Romeo & Juliet with fangs -- but it's great.
  Every vampire film slightly re-defines what the vampire is. Underworld has nice visual ideas and it is easy to find yourself taken in by this world. The characters take themselves seriously and the short dramatic scenes that are there are fine. In fact, I would say that I cannot fault anyones acting except for ""Kraven."" He was one-dimensional, but so what?
  I admit this is not the well-crafted masterpiece that ""Interview"" was, but this is an ACTION film. You don't go see ""True Lies"" and expect ""Shakespeare in Love"", do you? When you go see ""The Mummy"", are you expecting the acting calibre of ""A Beautiful Mind?""
  Underworld was a great story. It has guns and fighting and it's about a bitter war. These are creatures at war, fighting for their survival and they don't have time to say ""I never drink....wine.""

Vampires and werewolves have been at bitter war for centuries, each determined to drive the other to extinction. Now, the werewolves may have an edge as they discovered a way to combine the genes of both species to create a half-vampire, half-werewolf breed with strengths of both and none of their weaknesses. It all hinges on a human doctor, to whom Selene feels forbidden attraction, especially since he'll soon turn into a werewolf himself. The storyline was very tight, gradually revealing how the war began and not everyone is as he/she seems. The action sequences were amazing. The movie seems to have focused on building to story, perhaps leaving the personal drama and romance to the sequel which is in works. I'm looking forward to it.",1068336000,,837,4.901408450704225
1947824,5,B0000UI2NM,"I've been a fan of good Sci-Fi and Horror movies all my life. Started with ""ALIEN"" & ""An American Werewolf in London"" and seen mostly all that has come out. The 90's Teen ""horror"" movies, ie: Blairwitch, Scary Movie, I know what you did.. etc. were a TOTAL dissapointment... lame plots and bad, bad, acting!!
Then came Blade and Blade 2 (BOTH VERY GOOD)...and now this... INCREDIBLY good and will amaze you that the plot is actually very REMARKABLE...
I am also reading the book, which has a LOT of details that cannot be included in the movie due to lack of time (would make the movie too long!) But this series (there are 2 books,the 2nd one will be out March 2004) is THE BEST IN HORROR/ SCI-FI IN A LOOONG TIME..!!! WELL WORTH IT!!",1068336000,,735,4.411764705882353
1947825,4,B0000UI2NM,"...I learned from Underworld.
It has been a most educational experience, watching Underworld.  Until now I was walking around with some very laughable ideas about the Creatures of the Night that we all so take for granted as the pedestrian kind of beings that populate folklore.  From here on out I am enlightened; no longer a gullible moviegoer, or naive reader.  I can rely on the sophistication I have gleaned from this movie to move forward with confidence among the Undead.  Underworld set me straight.
For example, not just anybody has what it takes to become a vampire.  The first requirement for immortality is a European accent.  In fact, British and French accented vampires seem to be the most prolific, regardless of residence.  It would be considered extremely gauche for, say, a Texan accent to show up at one of the black tie coven soirees even if he sported the hippest Versace lace cravat.  Next, one must be a model.  This means high cheekbones, gauntly thin, and with a nose constantly in the air as one's lips form a slight pout in resting state.  Only the alpha females are allowed to have larger bustlines; this is so that those black leather designer fashions will drape nicely.  But above all, a vampire must have that cultivated air of aloof that can be obtained by constantly imagining an offensive odor.
Now werewolves have to be selected from an entirely different lot.  The master werewolf of Underworld must have scoured every biker bar in LA for swarthy males that with the proper ear hair.  Sideburns and a pointy unibrow will gain you extra points for consideration as well.  Blondes need not apply, as the lupine fashion seems to favor the swarthy look.  Fortunately for Americans, there is less discrimination here with regards to accent.  But make no mistake, the world of werewolves is a male dominated culture - women are for snacking only.
If your taste runs to the slaying side of things you should know that wooden stakes are pass.  Please.  Nowadays you will need automatic weaponry and explosive munitions.  Also, be aware that vampires and werewolves alike must have kept up on action flicks because now they have advanced martial art skills upon conversion and can unload seven clips worth of ammo into their foes without reloading.  And did you think vamps were the only ones who could run on walls and ceilings?  It's not just for Eurofrogs anymore.
Some further rules to keep in mind when cavorting with Underworld denizens are:
No athletic shoes.  No pastel or white clothing.
When in doubt, leather
Waterford crystal is the vessel of choice for blood-tasting parties.
Bottom line, this is an entertaining action flick that should appeal to those who like movies like Blade.  You can enjoy it if you keep that in mind.

1947826,5,B0000UI2NM,Sweet movie if you like werewolves and vampires. Thing is people don't see this movie for what it is. It's not a movie about them sucking people's blood and stuff. This is about a war between the 2 different bloodlines or whatever you would like to call it. I think half these people...where expecting to see a vampire / werewold horror movie. But I likes it. Great movie and pretty interesting.,1067385600,4,395,4.577464788732394
1947827,2,B0000UI2NM,"In UNDERWORLD, vampires and werewolves wage never-ending war on each other in and beneath a city perpetually cloaked in night.  Now the wolves are stalking humans, in search of...something.
The trailer for this looked amazing.  Even the film itself looked great.  The lighting, the design, the actors and their clothes are all gorgeous.  There's just no substance beneath it all.  The characters are flat and there is not nearly enough story to fill out the two hour running time.  Some of the acting is quite poor as well; Shane Brolly, who plays the current vampire lord, is particularly bad.  I would have liked to have seen more of Sophia Myles as his hopeful first lady.  Not only did she seem competent, but it would have added a much-needed subplot.
What there was of a story didn't make sense to me, although I can't say why without giving away what happens later in the film.
UNDERWORLD is less a horror film (it isn't ever scary) than a stylish action movie in horror dressing.  People are executing incredible acrobatic displays all over the place and bullets are constantly flying.  It is as if John Woo had decided to shift into the supernatural genre.  Nor is it a ""Romeo & Juliet"" story.  If there is any romance, it involves a triangle among three of the vampires, but it is left by the wayside.  It is a hybrid film with serious genetic defects, and it is boring.  Avoid this stale, unsatisfying piece of eye candy.",1067212800,4,1432,4.653386454183267

The scenery was like the crow in that it was mostly dark.  on the other hand it was like Blade because it had a lot of similar weaponry choices.  i highly approve because it held stuck to most of the truths about vampires.  all in all i thought it was an excently movie that will be added to my growing dvd collection and i highly recommend it!",1066867200,3,693,4.088888888888889

I think Len Wiseman did a commendable job for a first-time movie director.
This movie was full of action and eye-poping special effects.  The cinematography and overall look and feel of the movie was awesome.  Sure there could have been a myriad of things done better, but look for that in the sequel!
I knew right off that this movie was going to be enjoyable.  The idea alone was a great concept.  I for one will be going to see the next movie and read the next book.",1066694400,,652,4.217741935483871
1947830,4,B0000UI2NM,"Long-time fans of vampire movies will recognize, in Underworld, not so much a new development to the genre as a sleek elaboration of modern themes already familiar from Batman, The Matrix, Blade and the Anne Rice novels. Combining supernatural with high tech, fang teeth with martial arts, 17th century elegance with rock music, and ancient evil with sexy Goth costumes, these films are as modern as modern can be, and thus succeed in transporting us to a supernatural dream setting that is nonetheless intriguingly familiar.
Add to this the mix of terror and heart-breaking beauty, as patented by Anne Rice. The film's center of gravity is undoubtedly the character of Selene, played superbly by Kate Beckinsale. No longer the doll-like persona of Pearl Harbor and Serendipity, Kate as the vampire princess is a deadly hunter tracking the Lycans (werewolves) in the subways and labyrinths of London. Her skill with handguns is obvious, as is her determination and reckless courage, yet throughout she retains the unaffected, vulnerable little-girl appeal that is accentuated rather than diminished by the sexy leather outfit. In the very few times she uses her hands (as in the final scene where she disables Lucien's bodyguards), she shows a kind of understated grace that is very much a Kate Beckinsale trademark.
While I am obviously a Kate fan, her Selene persona was so darkly serious that putting in a wily charmer like Erika (Sophia Myles) to share a few scenes with her was, I think, a neat counterpoint. Likewise, against an overall plot depicting vicious killers caught in a maelstrom of revenge, you have one or two remarkably restrained scenes wherein Selene discovers conflicting new feelings. As in Romeo and Juliet, the viewer starts to worry about how Selene and her new-found love are going to survive. A worthy addition to the body of vampire lore!

I suppose the well-deserved popularity of Underworld invites its share of negative reviews by people who want to tell us more about their ""high"" standard of cinematic taste than about the movie itself. A pity. If you insist on comparing every wine to Petrus or Haut-Brion, you miss out on the simple joy of a cool Beaujolais on a summer's eve. And never for you the thrill of following Selene on a hunt through the bowels of the night!",1066694400,3,2304,4.953488372093023
1947831,2,B0000UI2NM,"They took all the cool things about vampyres and werwolves and agresivly left them out.  The funniest seen is when a group of vamps is peering into a dark corner trying to see if there is a wolf in their. Gee can't vampyres see in dim light? cant they fly or change forms (rats, wolves mist etc.)? arn't they wise and minipulative due to their long lives and experience? arn't they cruel, evil, almost demonic?  I know that every vampyre movie has the right to rework the lore (dracula, blade, lost boys) but this movie never seems to get around to telling us exactly what these vampyres are or what powers they have.  they seem completely non-supernatural and too lame matrix-y.  I'm only metioning the vamps because the wolves were complete non-entities. I never understood what the point in being a wolf was because they never DID anything.  They didn't seem tourtured, out of control, drunk with power, NOTHING! and their transformations were rediculuse: they took about fifteen minutes and always accured in dark corners (presumably so the vampyres couldn't see them). The biggest surprise was that a movie about vampyres and werewolves fighting would consists totaly of them driving around in cars shooting at each other.

It seems the director and costume designer spent alot of time renting last year's action movies from Blockbuster. If i had wanted to watch the Matrix or Blade i would have. A note to all of you: BEEN THERE. DONE THAT. I unfortunately watched this movie in theatres. Twice. At first, i admit i wasn't totally bored out of my mind. It was still better than The Matrix Reloaded. On the second viewing, a few things caught my attention. The sheer number of times the vampires stalked about their mansion against the *exact* same background music, and the incessant shots of Kate Beckinsale's face looking sad and misunderstood provoked two responses:
a) rolling on the floor laughter at the lameness, hurling popcorn in every direction, and b) a growing rampant desire to start a picket line in front of the tickebooth.
If this hasn't convinced you not to see the movie, then i've failed. Here's to hoping you have enough sense to stay the heck away from it...

Sure it was kinda silly or stupid, but who cares. Some people claimed it was ""trashy"" or ""cheesey"". But that was part of the appeal. Get a DVD for myself on this one. It reminded me of Blade, The Matrix, The Crow, Queen of the Damned, and a few other movies I can't remember right now. If the dialoge was lame, so what!

1947835,2,B0000UI2NM,"I went to see this movie fully expecting a gothic, edgy, beautifully shot horror movie.  I ended up being HORRIFICALLY BORED!  The scenery is OK when you can see it, the nicest scenes being in the Vampyre's lair.  Of course, you rarely ever leave the Lair, and that is one of the problems.  Werewolf (Lyken)transformations are not at all enthralling, especially if you have seen ""An American Werewolf in London"" (which actually has better transformation scenes then this movie) the story is muddled, sequences of events muddled, not at all even remotely believable.  I saw ""Blade"" and enjoyed it, even if it was violent and a little dumb.  Not so with this movie.  I regret not going to see it Matinee.  By the way, the costumes really aren't great (lot of Blade and Matrix going on, nothing at all original) and there were NO surprises whatsoever.  My sister actually fell asleep.  Kate Beckinsale should have done another movie; she doesn't have the inherent edgy viciousness that I think the lead actress should have had.  She was wimpy and boring.  Vampyres should be a little mean, no? Her human pet project was equally dull and disappointing.  I went to the movies with anticipation, and came out of the theater disgusted.  Take it from me...i see a lot of movies and can appreciate a good flick.  This wasn't one.  Beware!",1065830400,,1329,4.7631578947368425
1947836,4,B0000UI2NM,I think the movie was pretty good.  Plenty of action.  The movie doesnt give up the plot until the end.  That is what I liked most about it.  I would probably go and see an Underworld 2 if made.,1065830400,2,194,3.8974358974358974
1947837,4,B0000UI2NM,"This is quite a good first time movie from the director and co-screenwriters. They've created a deep and dark universe where Vampires and Werewolves have been warring for centuries and filled it with interesting characters. The setting seems Londonish with hints of Eastern Europe with a dash of Blade Runner. There's lot of rain and underground tunnels to stalk through. And there are several corners for death to lurk around.
The Vampires are decadent, the Werewolves gritty and their conflicts both high-tech and hard punching. Fight scenes are both stylized and horrific. Not a lot of gore but enough for me to give it 4 stars. It's not for everybody. But if you liked Blade, The Crow and the first two Alien movies, you'll probably like this one. Underworld has been compared to The Matrix and there are some things similar but not enough for it to seem derivative. It's possible to see several influences in Underworld but it has enough fresh material to be a very new on the Vampires vs Werewolves battles.
I didn't realize this was a starting point for a trilogy but this movie works as either the first episode or as a stand-alone story. Underworld is the story of the Vampire Death Dealer Selene. Played wonderfully by Kate Beckinsale, Selene is driven, ruthless, tough and more vulnerable than she knows. This is her tale of self-awakening and a changing of the world for the Vampire and Werewolves Clans.
Just about everything works in this movie. There's a good mix of background, lots of action, great characters and a premise that hangs together. The mythology is well described and seems to be thought out very well. Every character has an agenda and no one is to be trusted too much. It's definitely worth a look. I'm looking forward to the next in the series, should it come to pass.",1065657600,6,1801,4.757188498402556
1947838,3,B0000UI2NM,"First, let me say the ""UNDERWORLD"" is a contemporarry film for the times we live in. Our world literally falls into the dubious camp of Lycan or Vampyre. It just depends on how you view yourself.
 Having just completed reading the novelization of ""UNDERWORLD"", I can truthfully say that it surpasses the movie version par excellence revealing the holes in the script and directing.
 It is not enough to display the fact that history repeats itself time and time again in this film but more important the real interactions between lead actor Scott Speedman and lead actress Kate Beckinsale which came across in the film like a polite Japanese bowing ceremony. It was atrocious to say the least.
 I thought the meaning of going to the theatre was sadly to be entertained at the very best. Wasn't there supposed to be passionate kissing and heart-rending embraces plus holding of hands or a head snuggling against a shoulder? Could it be that the dirctor Len Wiseman wanted Kate Beckinsale all to himself and that alone prevented a good movie from being a fine art film.
 The allure of this movie ranged from the brilliant choreography, the fast paced action and excellent dialogue. Guns blazing in tune with the riveting story only brings the point home. The titanic fight scene between Viktor and Michael could have been more dramatic like the novel or the ""Matrix"".
 Will there be a UNDERWORLD2? Maybe if you replace the director with John Woo or Paul Verhoeven.",1065571200,,1462,4.832
1947839,4,B0000UI2NM,"I wanted to see 'Underworld' since I heard that Kate Beckinsale was attached to it. I admire her as an actress and its premise of a Romeo-and-Juliet-meets-vampire-vs.-werewolf movie intrigued me.  As a fan of genre films like 'The Matrix,' 'The Crow,'  'Blade' and 'Equilibrium', I was keen on watching this film.  My expectations were  high and I'm glad to report that I came out of the theater wanting to see the movie again.  From the first few seconds when Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is introduced, I was hooked.  This was one heck of an exciting and immersive ride indeed!
Highlights for me include:
- Main characters (with a couple of exceptions) did a great job - particularly Selene (Kate Beckinsale), Michael (Scott Speedman), Erika (Sophia Myles), Raze (Kevin Grevioux) and Lucian (Michael Sheen) ' and were well cast.  The vampires are elegant and sophisticated while the lycans are husky, rough and brooding.
- Scott Speedman ' I never watched 'Felicity' but I didn't realize he could be such a hunk!
?? Very cool costumes ' I just love those vampires in their sleek black skintight leather outfits, which bring to mind Trinity from 'The Matrix.'
- The storyline ' this is really much more than a vampire vs. lycan, Romeo and Juliet type film.  It goes deeper than just the themes of love and hate.  Themes of oppression, tolerance, deception, revenge and survival are also explored. And there is even a history which goes back to the Dark Ages (which we will see more of in the sequels) and is briefly explored in this film.
- The action sequences truly rock.  I hate to sound like an MTV commercial but this really is the best way to describe it.  Every time the lycans and vampire clash is just sooo cool.  'Equilibrium,' 'Blade' and 'The Matrix' come to mind but it is particularly awesome to watch Raze, Lucian and Selene fight.  The last 20 minutes alone are worth the price of the movie ticket.  It is one heck of ride!
- Contrary to other reviews, the special effects are quite good. CGI/stop motion effects has come a long way with portraying werewolf transformations since 'American Werewolf in London,' ""The Howling"" and 'Silver Bullet.'
- The brooding, dark backgrounds remind me of 'The Crow.' Very atmospheric and works well with the somewhat gothic mood.
- The ending is satisfying but also leaves room for a sequel.  And for those who wonder why there are a couple of loose ends; well, the filmmakers intended this to be a trilogy.  It still doesn't do away with the fact that it has a very exciting and satisfactory conclusion.  I'm looking forward to revisiting this story again and again on DVD.
Low points:
- I wasn't crazy about Shane Brolly (Kraven) and Bill Nighy (Viktor)  - they looked the part but played off too much to the camera.  They could use acting lessons on subtlety.  Michael Sheen, who gave a poignant performance as Lucian, could give them a few pointers.
- There was a small bit towards the end was a bit 'cringe-inducing.' It reminded me too much of the end of 'Equilibrium.' This particular one involved Viktor and Selene.
A couple of things to remember before going to see 'Underworld':  1) This is not a scare-fest.  Just because it features vampires and werewolves does not mean that this is your typical jump-off-your-seat thriller.  Go watch or rent '28 Days Later' or 'The Howling' if you want a scary film.  2) This is not a 'The Matrix'-type film. Even though some of the action sequences and costume design are borrowed from 'The Matrix,' this is not a sci-fi film.  There are very strong comic book / graphic novel influences but this is probably closer to 'Blade' and 'The Crow' than it is 'The Matrix.'  If you can get over these 2 main preconceptions, then you are set to have a good time.  And if you enjoyed any of the films that I have compared it to in this review, then don't waste any more time and go see it for yourself!!",1065398400,18,3893,4.6535087719298245

We start off with Kate Beckinsales[Selene] charater talking about the war with vampires and lycans [warewolfs]. The vampires spend most of the movie explaing why warewolfs are bad, blah, blah, blah. The transformation of lycans into warewolfs made my eyes hurt, and I had a head ache thought the movie, cause of that. The fight scenes are ok, but it has some cool weapons and cars. This movie could HAVE been way much better. If it would have taken place in a mid-evil setting with modern weaponary, and showen the fall of Lution [lycan king] instead of showing it in a book,""Underworld"" would have a worthwhile movie. The acting is ok, and theres tons of blood, some badwords, and a suprise plot twist, that literally takes you by surpise, which I add is very interesting. I'll give an interesting spoiler; one of the charaters dies ""Ghost Ship style"" if you have seen that movie you know what I am talking about. Its one of the few actully likeable scenes. Another plot twist is when an another charater gets biten and has both vampire and lycan blood, another few likeable scence. So in a nutshell don't watch it only if you want to be bored and have half of your body fall asleep, I wasted a few good dollers on this movie and time that could been used to on something productive.",1065398400,,1421,4.511627906976744

You have to pay close attention to what's going on. Underworld can easily throw you out of line sometimes. Yes, it's a battle between the vampires and the lycanthropes (werewolves), but there is deeper plot. Not everyone is who they seem. The end wraps up very nicely with no flaws (that I saw anyway). Perfect.
No wonder Underworld earned the title '#1 movie in America.' Music video director Len Wiseman made a great film debut. Don't let this one pass you by.",1065398400,,612,4.783018867924528
1947842,4,B0000UI2NM,"Centuries old feud between 2 races,werewolves ( Lycans ) and vampires, that has resulted in undying hatred, torture, and death. The main character Selene finds out that the Lycans plan on using a human name Michael to create a super creature, with the combination of both Lycan and vampire blood running through his veins, to destroy the race of vampires, in order to make the race of werewolves ( Lycans ) stronger. While Selene is helping to keep Michael alive and out of ""harms"" way, from both Lycans and vampires, She and Michael form an unlikely bond. Now to my personal opinions..Kate Beckinsale did a nice performance as the grim face vampire warrior, Selene. Eventhough, Her emotional range was not showcase in this particular movie, except from going from grim to uninterested to thoughtful to teary eye....all emotions smothered under an ever present grim look. Her character still was still quick thinking. Poor Scott Speedman's character ""Michael"" had to spend most of the movie, on the run and clueless, until he got bitten by the leader of the Lycans name Lucian. And, For myself, that is when this movie got extremely interesting when Lucian ( Michael Sheen ) was on the screen. There was alittle bit of storyline in which I did wonder about the past histories of the characters Selene and Michael, before they unexpectly ""met"", But, An entire seperate movie could be made solely on the character Lucian and what he went through in his past, to become so angry, brutal, and ruthless. Michael Sheen had the standout performance in this movie, as the character Lucian. He took his character a step above the rest by not only showing that his character was hostile, but underneath all of that bitterness, there was simply a hurt man, who wanted his race of werewolves, who were consider weakand powerless to the vampires, to be stronger physically against their enemies, and for him to seek revenge against the brutal death of his bride and unborn child. Actor Michael Sheen also showed the deep passion Lucian had, sometimes only by the look in his eyes, you could tell depth, wisdom, and experience in his character. The Flashbacks of the tortured Lucian meant to me, that there was a storyline somewhere in this movie, instead of that senseless gun battle between Lycans and vampires, on a subway deck, at the beginning of this movie. Erika ( Sophia Myles ) and Kahn ( Robby Gee ) gave a good performance showing that their vampire characters had common senseand intelligence, without solving their issues with a use of the gun. Bill Nighy as Viktor was just as good as the elder stotic vampire, who wasn't as honorable and good hearted, as one might think. The deep voice muscular Lycan/ werewolf ""Raze"" played by actor Kevin Grevioux did a good performance in his character, eventhough, he didn't have much dialogue, you can tell the dedication and loyality that he had, to help his race and Lucian, get rid of all vampires. Shane Brolly ( Kraven ) protrayed his character as a shallow, arrogant, spoiled vampire, who would probably be better off as a runway model, than a vampire. I mean, no one could walk up and down those steps of his mansion with ease and an attitude, like Kraven could throughout the movie. All and all, Underworld was surprisely, a good movie. Except for the over use sometimes of the characters resolving their issues with the use of their guns, instead of just using their brains for once, and thinking of a better way to do battle with one another, The movie was very interesting to see. I think anyone who has an interest in seeing a vampire / werewolf movie done alittle differently from the normal, should atleast see this movie once, with an open mind.",1065312000,,3700,4.773790951638065
1947843,4,B0000UI2NM,"Underworld, an action flick starring Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman can be called diverting entertainment.  Though the plot of the film is rather incomprehensible, the film has enough style to be atleast watchable.  Director Len Wisemen who is recently engaged to Beckinsale) creates a nice setting to the film, with the appropriate tone.  The action scenes are pretty good, as well the visual effects which are passingly cool including the transformation of humans into werevolves.
  Kate Beckinsale plays Selene, a vampire.  The film takes place in London.  There are mainly two striving groups, the vampires and the lycans a.k.a. werewolves.  Scott Speedman plays a human who has been bitten and has transformed into a lycan.  Unfortunately Beckinsale and Speedman fall in love, which is intolerable since they are sworn enemies.
  Underworld is mild for the genre, since it isn't overly graphic, though there still is an abundant amount of violence.  Mainly including much gunplay, impalements, bitings (some of which are bloody), whippings and fights among vampries/lycans.  There isn't much profanity, just a few instances of the ""f"" and ""s"" word.  Underworld is rated R for Strong Violence/Gore and Some Language.  As for the acting, well it wasn't totally believe or convincing but then again you don't expect oscar-worthy acting in a film like this.  I saw it in theatres, sadly not during opening weekend.  This film is worth viewing in theatures, and possibly owning on Video or DVD.",1065225600,,1498,5.226890756302521
1947844,3,B0000UI2NM,"Perched on a ledge high above a dark, rain soaked city, a woman and her companion watch and wait. For Selene (Kate Beckinsale), this is a night like many others where she will seek out Lycans (werewolves), and eliminate them in accordance with a centuries old blood feud between the two mythical races.
With the Lycans thought to be on the verge of extinction the vampires are preparing to form a new coven by merging with a powerful overseas clan. Towards this end, members of both houses plan to awaken one of their two great leaders to guide the vampires into a new era of prosperity. Selene is troubled by the plans, as she believes that the Lychans are massing in greater numbers under the leadership of their leader Lucian (Michael Sheen), whom the vampires believe died centuries ago.
Further complicating matters is Selenes concern that the present leader of the vampires Kraven (Shane Brolly), may not be willing to release the power he now holds and that the Lichens interest in a mortal named Michael (Scott Speedman), may indeed be the key to a larger threat to her people.
Selene is forced to defy Kraven and leave the safety of the vampire mansion to locate Michael before the Lychan hordes are able to and use him for their sinister plans. While the action in Underworld is loud, it never seems to have the intensity that it should, as the sense of urgency and tension seems to be missing. The cast is good, but they do not display much emotional depth and this hinders the efforts of the audience to form a connection with the characters and care for their fates.
That being said, Underworld does a fantastic job with breathing new life into the vampire genre. Director Len Wiseman bathes the viewers in images of eerie translucence that combine various color hues to create a look that enhances the action by surrounding it in an otherworldly ambience.
Writers Kevin Grevioux and Danny McBride are to be commended for breathing new life into the genres as he gives us a tale that entertains yet expands upon the traditional lore of the creatures and if for nothing else, that alone makes Underworld pure entertainment and a must see film for fans of the genre.

1947845,5,B0000UI2NM,"I was greatly surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie.  At first, I thought that it would be a Blade Runner type action movie and have little in regards to character growth or a well conceived plot.  I was going to wait until the DVD release, but then decided to see it in the theater since I have enjoyed Ms. Beckinsale's work on other pictures.  I have now seen Underworld three times!  The plot was complex and in the end, I could tell that there was an effort to talk about the problems that we still have with race relations.  However, it was Kate's performance that really won me over.  The character of Selene was thoughtfully brought to life with Kate's performance and I believe it was this that made the movie a success.  It was very wise to focus a lot of the movie on Selene's character growth.  At first, she was a Vampire warrior.  At the end, she was closer to rediscovering her lost humanity.
Underworld proves that a movie with a modest budget can still delight fans with excellent characters, particularlly Selene, and a well constructed story.  I look forward to revisiting this world many times in the future.",1065139200,,1132,4.532019704433497
1947846,4,B0000UI2NM,"Upon watching UNDERWORLD for the first time, I wasn't expecting to be very interested. I had read so many negative reviews and heard so many people say that it was a rip-off of ROMEO AND JULIET, that I just wasn't expecting much. Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised when the final credits started to roll and I was left sitting in my seat thinking, ""What? It's over already?""

As many have already stated, the film is about a vampire death-slayer (vampires who hunt wearwolves) who falls in love with a human who has been bitten by her most hated enemy, the werewolf overlord who was supposed to have been killed centuries before. The film starts off somewhat slow then rushes into a fighting frenzy, then slows down, then rushes into a fighting frenzy, then slows down. The entire movie is paced this way. Some find it irritating. However, I felt that it added to the mood of the movie, the pace of the film accompanying the transformations that the characters undergo both physically and psychologically.

The lighting and costumes seemed to fit the dark underworld that is the setting for most of the film. The only time the tones lightened up were in flashbacks to centuries before when the wearwolves and vampires weren't at war, suggesting a more pleasant era.

The characters in the movie aren't allowed to develop much, except through narrative. However, I didn't find that this took anything away from the movie.

Much like all franchises (as UNDERWORLD is sure to become), this film sets up everything that is to come in the next. This isn't a thinking person's movie nor is it a full blown action piece; in the style and tone the movie has more of a literary feel than anything else. My only complaint is that there wasn't enough conflict between the wearwolves and the vampires; so much time is spent on setting the tone, mood, and narrative that there wasn't much time left for action. Nevertheless, I still found that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and look forward to seeing it again.",1065139200,,2001,4.741379310344827

1947848,4,B0000UI2NM,"Augh, I get so tired of people slamming movies just to make themselves appear to be some sorts of cinema gods who think everything's supposed to be high art.  This movie was perfectly enjoyable for what it was.  I even went to see it twice, and I may go again.  I am a huge horror genre fan, werewolves in particular.  Ever since I was a kid I've had a fascination with them.  So, when I heard this movie was coming out, I flipped with excitement.  And I was not let down, for the most part.
Granted, the acting in this movie WAS a bit cheeeezy, but so what?  Not the first time I sat through a fine movie all the while tolerating bad acting (Titanic's Leo anyone?). Beckinsale did a great job with what she had, though I would have liked to see just a bit more emotional range in her character.  Speedman was...okay..for the small part he had.  He too needed a little help in the emoting department though.  God help us..many of the vamp crew's acting was absolutely hilarious. Especially Viktor's slight hillbilly accent here and there.  But, I can deal with that.  Its not like this movie had the budget to hire a whole slew of A listers AND supply them with their 30 mil-a-piece paychecks AND bow to their expensive whims and demands.  We'd have had paper vampires had that been the case, cause that's all they'd have been able to afford.
And now, the werewolves.  I am extremely judgemental when it comes to the depiction of these fantasy creatures in movies and books.  I don't find any other fantasy creature quite as horrific and cool as the werewolf.  So when I saw the trailers for UW, I thought, ""Oh God no..not more CG 'Paris' hairless dogs!!""  For the life of me..I wish cinema would go back to the good old days of fabulous make up work and leave the CG where it belongs...(in the Matrix).  HOWEVER, I found myself quite surprised when I saw them in the film.  They're well done, well lit, and the CG is very limited.  There are suits and makeup involved in close shots whereas the CG is only used for specific scenes...namely the 'wall crawling' scenes, which WOULD have been cool had they been better animated, but they were okay nonetheless.  Also, they weren't shown in full light too much.  The very shape and sound of them was enough to scare you.  The trick to good horror is not showing stuff...leave it to the imaginations of the viewers, and they'll be a lot more afraid.  I do wish the wolves would have had just a little more airtime though...they really were very cool, and coming from me that's a big compliment.
Overall, this movie was quite good, despite some obvious flaws.  So it wasn't strikingly fresh and original...but is anything these days?  Please...  Go see this movie for what it is: a good gun-fightin, monster-warring goth fantasy flick.  Dont go in expecting Evian and peeled grapes and tormented actresses portraying deaf british writers...if you want that, go to an art house, and leave us plain-jane horror movie fans in peace.",1065052800,3,2974,4.560377358490566
1947849,1,B0000UI2NM,"dont see this movie in the theatres. don't buy it on dvd.  watch it on cable, rent it as a bargain price or borrow it from a friend if you must see it.  patience is only a mild form of despair after all and actually paying more than three dollars to see this movie where you can't pause it no matter how big the screen is is just not worth the time, money, without factoring the oppurtunity cost of what you could be doing instead.  let's face it. kate's hot, the cinematography was pretty, and we are familiar with enough movies like this that were good, alien 1-3, terminator, matrix, batman, the crow, that it would be easy to say yes i liked. but people are so no and i am glad people have more sense.  i don't care if they paid for a decent soundtrack.  that's a marketing peripheral people hollywood learned from sinatra or jean kelly, but was revitalized with the in the early 90s etc.  anyway, plot?  hah.  like scooping up a trash can full of frogs, and stomping in it to see if youll squash one.  i will only say that it is ridiculous to attribute all of the morphological changes and powers of these creatures which seem to break not just constraints of biology and evolution but mechanical physics as well to viruses.  viruses to make you turn into a giant monster and back again violating conservation of mass and energy both times.  it's ridiculous.  people are afraid just to say ""it's magic"" so they have to invent bogus science like ""silver nitrate"" bullets or ""irradiated"" bullets. you know if uv kills vampires, you could just get a bunch of uv bulbs and blast them at your convenience without even having to use guns. in a similar fashion the werewolf tunnels could be flooded with silver nitrate.  why silver nitrate was not employed by vampires when it was discovered about three hundred some odd years ago by alchemists.  if the military can provide them with weapons of mass destruction not just guns but grenades, how is being an ""immortal"" better than just being a human with access to high tech weaponry.  i thought it would be nice if they had actually somehow adapted to 21st century technology and culture unlike the blade movies but apparently not.  long live the brides of dracula and peter cushing.",1064966400,2,2231,4.54
1947850,4,B0000UI2NM,"Do not be led astray by the excellently edited theatrical preview for this film, it is neither a successful Matrix-esque actioner nor a star-crossed romance pic. It is, 'underneath it all' a blood feud movie between werewolves and vampires. It has more in common with 'West-Side Story' or an old mob movie than its oft compared 'Romeo and Juliet'. Though, on the surface, it is exactly 'Romeo and Juliet': Selene (Beckinsale) and Michael Corvin (Speedman) are in love and play for opposite teams. Their respective families are bound by the omnipresent 'covenant' to keep them apart. However, their romance is too underdeveloped and too unbelievable to serve as story. They share almost no dialogue with each other and have zero chemistry... what their attraction does lead to is the real story of the film, which is what's behind this thousand year feud between vampires and werewolves. And fortunately for us movie-goers, the answer to that question is entertaining enough to save this movie.
If you can stick with the 'Undeworld' through the first half, you've pretty much got it made. The plot progresses ploddingly through varying degrees of action sequences set in noticeably digitally-enhanced sets. The action itself is sub-par, as Beckinsale seems clumsy with her weapons, and the slow-mo editing of all the acrobatics doesn't disguise well the fact that all the actors are connected to harnesses. The sequences are often over-long and timed irregularly. For example, I can suspend my disbelief enough to allow for a war between vampires and werewolves, but I can't believe that it would take three werewolves ten minutes to run down a ten foot long hallway. That said, once the halfway point hits and the actual story begins to unfold, the action (though still choppy) at least has some emotion invested in it. The plight of ... (I'll leave this blank so as not to spoil anything) ... is engaging and somewhat of a surprise. The apparent villains shift around from character to character until the final sequence in which every character seems to have a justifiable reason to be attacking/attacked. It all leads to a tremendous (if somewhat heavy handed) finale that rescues a two star movie and nearly boosts it up to a four star movie. Anyone looking for a good time will surely get it here, and anyone looking for a little more depth out of an action/horror/sci-fi can get it here too. Not many films in the past couple of months can claim the same.",1064966400,3,2461,4.918269230769231
1947851,2,B0000UI2NM,"Thoughts :  Too much hype, that is what I have to say about this movie. Hyde is right in stating that the movie is an ACTION movie with horror overtones, but unfortunately it is TOO much on the action front. Not that I totally dislike action flicks, but if I go to see a movie billed as a horror movie, that is what I expect.
Cast/Characters : Beckinsale is a tremendous actress, but not in this role. The word mousey comes to mind, no matter how much black leather she wears or how many guns she carries around. Give her some Shakespeare and see her true calling.

Story/Plot : I enjoyed the whole concept of the movie, that the battle has been waged for many years. It's always good to have the bad guys duking it out. Also making everything modern worked well, too.
Pace : Very poor pace on this film. You would have this long, drawn out dramatic scene and just when it built up to it's peak BAM!, scene change. Far too much jumping from situation to situation.....even I got lost a few times in the movie. And HOW MANY FRICKIN' TIMES can we do a shot of Selene standing at a door and either pushing it open in the slow frame effect or just kicking it in? Oh my!

F/X : I enjoyed the special effects immensely! The changing of man to werewolf was well done and even the fight scenes (though just a few too many drawn out) were well done.

Rating :  Pick me up and then let me fall. That is what I ended up feeling about this movie. This one gets a 2 star  rating from me. Wait for video for sure....get the DVD to enjoy the effects but don't say I didn't warn ya!

1947852,3,B0000UI2NM,"I really wanted to like this movie, a lot. First, it has Kate Beckinsale, who I have loved and followed ever since she appeared in ""Cold Comfort Farm"" (hopefully my wife understands). She's pretty, personable, and, in this film, very sexy looking. But for whatever reason the director fails to take advantage of her presence.
As far as plot goes, apparently vampires and werewolves, or as they are called in the film, lycans, have been at war for centuries. Beckinsale is Selene, a vampire who specializes in hunting and killing lycans. Early in the movie, she discovers that lycans are tracking a human, Scott Speedman, but can't figure out why (and guess what, she's a very high tech vamp).  Her curiosity causes her to come into conflict with the present leaders of the vampires and to, naturally, meet and fall in love with Speedman.
As the story progresses, she uncovers a plot to overthrow the current vampire hierarchy and, in the one clever twist to the plot, also learns that she may have more in the common with the lycans than she thought.
The film is beautifully shot in a blue tint, but for some reason, its almost constantly raining throughout the film. Apparently vampires don't have to worry about black mold problems in their homes. There also seem to be problems with the passage of time. It seems obvious that all the action is taking place over several days, but its always night throughout the film and we never get any indication that daylight has come and gone.
It is also apparent that all the action is taking place in an old, unnamed European city (Budapest in reality), but apparently Americans are studying medicine there with no language difficulties. Speedman appears to be a med student and works at a hosptial with other Americans.
The special effects are, well, not too special and the overall plot is just trying to be way too clever for its own good. The filmmakers clearly want to keep us guessing about exactly what is going on throughout the movie, but its obvious in watching the actors who is going to turn out to be a bad guy (a relative term in a film about werewolves and vampires). Moreover, other than Beckinsale, most of the acting is pretty bad.
There are also plenty of illogical moments, particularly given the wealth of vampire lore with which most viewers would be familiar. At one point Speedman saves Beckinsale from drowning and essentially resusitates her. Excuse me, but aren't vampires pretty much immortal and capable of being killed by only a limited number of means? Last time I checked, drowning was not among them. And other than Beckinsale and a few other key characters, these have got to be some of the wimpiest vampires to appear on celluloid.
The film also seems to strain against its budget, esspecially in the special effects department. Who would think that the old Lon Chaney, Jr. wolfman could be more convincing than modern CGI werewolves (at least I think it was CGI)? But that's exactly how I felt while watching this movie. Its too bad that they've squandered what could have been a very cool film by saddling it with a bad plotline and poor effects.
Still, the film is worth viewing for the excellent cinematography and Kate Beckinsale. And get ready for ""Underworld II"" as the ending makes it clear someone is already planning on a sequel.",1064880000,5,3317,4.748700173310225
1947853,1,B0000UI2NM,"This may not be the dumbest movie, or the most poorly acted, but it comes close.  The script may not be supremely dreadful, but it tries.  Let's just say that Underworld gives Tim Burton's remake of  Planet of the Apes a run for its money in the ""Just Plain Awful"" department.
Where to begin?  The worst part of the movie is the acting.  With the exception of Kate Beckinsale, who makes the most of a character as thinly drawn as a Saran wrap, the acting is gag-out-loud atrocious.  Worst of the lot is the actor who portrayed Kraven (yes, that's really his name), a guy named Shane Brolly whose career, we can only hope, is over.  To say that he's the worst of this sad lot means he needs to be run out of the business with a pointed stick.
God, I don't want to waste anymore time writing a review of this trash.  The music is loud--and bad.  The writing is cliched--and bad.  The cinematography is dark blue--and bad.  And there are so many ripoffs from other films, including spare costumes from the Matrix, that you wish that audiences could file a class action lawsuit for paying good money for this cheap rip-off.

1947854,3,B0000UI2NM,"If you want to see gun blazing action between werewolves and vampires, Underworld delivers. However, I feel it is overshadowed by other vampire movies (Blade, Blade 2) which have far superior fight coreography and character developement. The werewolves are probably the most interresting part of the movie. The visual effects of their transformations are awe inspiring. The vampires seem to be whimpy. They don't have the superhuman powers normally posesses by vampires. They are strong, but where are the super senses? The stealth? In one scene one of the vampires stands in a beam of sunlight (?) and looks into a dark hole in the wall, unable to make out the werewolf hiding in the darkness. What's wrong with this picture? The beautifully sculpted Beckensale is hypnotic to watch in her skin-tight leather outfit. She does a good job acting the part and leading the film but she needs to play paintball a few times to learn how to move her hands like a real experienced gunfighter. The pistols she uses seem to have an unlimited suply of ammunition. They're fully automatic and can blast away for about a minute without a fresh magazine. I know a lot of firearms depicted in movies seem to have these ""dream magazines,"" but to those of us who know a thing or two about firearms, it completely drains the illusionary world the film is trying to create.
All in all, it's a decent action vampire film with good visual effects. You might want to wait for the rental on this one.",1064793600,3,1478,4.732558139534884

I haven't laughed that hard at a movie since, oh, The Crow 2, perhaps. It wasn't quite as funny as Species or Anaconda, but it did give me fits of giggles several times. One of those times was during Michael's transformation scene, when we inexplicably got some sort of internal cam view,...!
Another time was when the Garou, I mean Lycans, were galloping along the walls just like the dog alien in Alien3. I gleed aloud!
Then there was that time when Kraven showed up, arrayed like Liberace in all his sequinned glory. I oohed loudly,...
And then another time was during that fateful sword cut, but I mustn't give all the ""good"" parts away, right?
The movie tries hard to be equal parts The Crow, Batman, and Matrix, all while obviously scooping generously from the heap of White Wolf supplements at its side.
The end result is akin to Queen of the Damned meets An American Lycan Werewolf in Paris. It is a LARPers wet dream, where Toreadors languish moodily in gorgeous gowns and warrior women fight in leather corsets and shined-up scuba suits. Take that as you will",1064793600,2,1189,4.586854460093897

On the outside, Underworld is a stylish thriller that boasts a very attractive female lead, although Beckinsale's true acting talents aren't entirely put to use.  Speedman is wasted as the hapless sap who just happens to be the right guy at the wrong time.  The special effects (especially the werewolf transformations) are phenominal; these effects have come a long way since The Howling.  Other than that though, Underworld is just a mess.  The action scenes seem to be derivative hybrids of The Matrix, Blade, Resident Evil, and a mess of other action/sci-fi/horror films.  Plus, by the time the credits start rolling, we are left with one too many loose ends and questions, plus an ending epilogue that automatically opens the door for an inevitable sequel.

1947860,3,B0000UI2NM,"Vampire and werewolf movies usually come in two flavors: one has great special effects with minimal character development while the other is the reverse.  When Bela Lugosi hammed it up in DRACULA, his rich, Hungarian cadences resonate even today.  Lugosi did not need any effect more special than a dark, creepy castle in which to lay in his coffin.  In UNDERWORLD, director Len Wiseman presents a milennia long epic struggle between vampires and lycans (werewolves) in what should have been a riveting tale of a blood feud heightened by some truly outstanding special effects.  The problem with UNDERWORLD and films that emphasize sight and sound over characterization is that the balance between the two is a subtle one and that if one is to dominate, then that one should be the latter.  One can always tell when this balance is out of whack.  If at any time, the viewer has a hard time distinguishing between one set of species and another, then he is pretty sure that the intent of the film is to dazzle the eye rather than engage the mind.  Kate Beckinsale is Selene, a vampire killer of werewolves.  In her hunting for the lycans, she wears an expression that is as ossified as any that Clint Eastwood has worn.  She neither frowns, smiles, nor shows the slightest interest in the rather interesting events engulfing her.  In fact, she is more an expressionless  female version of another vampire hunter (Wesley Snipes) in the BLADE series.  Her male lead is Scott Speedman, who plays Michael, a normal human being whom the lycans relentlessly pursue.  The plot revolves around why the lycans want him and what the vampires can do to prevent him from falling into their lupine clutches.
I quibble over the wasted potential of a plot that combines ROMEO AND JULIET, BLADE, and centuries-old conspiracy storylines.  The only interesting point of the plot was the unexpectedly engaging character of Lucian (Michael Sheen), who as the bearded leader of the lycans, first horrifies us, then causes us to feel some sympathy for a species that is simply reacting to prevent its own destruction by a competing one.  There are too many scenes of gratuitous violence, with both lycan and vampire using modern technological firearms to blast away at each other as if they were no more than urban gangbangers delighting in drive by shootings.  Further, there were several scenes in which I had some difficulty separating a vampire gunslinger from his lycan counterpart.  Beckinsale and Speedman are attractive actors who were clearly instructed by the director to vent their inner demons in over the top gravity defying leaps and bounds.  Lugosi, by contrast, never had to amble faster than a slow and dignified gate.  UNDERWORLD promises to be the kind of movie that will initially do well at both the both office and the video market.  But in years to come, the vampire film that will continue to fascinate a new generation of viewers will still be the one that has the Transylvanian count intoning: ""Come here, Van Helsing.""",1064707200,3,3022,4.8882352941176475

Having said that, UNDERWORLD is really not that bad. It's stylish and fast-paced. There is something in it for everyone: science, revenge, mystery, thrill, horror and of course love. These elements are not overdone or abused. Some scenes might make you snicker, though, because the acting is so over-the-top. What I really liked about this movie was the fact that it did emphasize on the story rather than overdoing the cheesy horror routines that are bane to such genre of films.

If you have the chance to do something new and different take that chance.  This was Len Wiseman first movie which to say for a freshman is was decent.  My biggest complaint had to do with a plot that was thin.  I am a huge fan of the Vampire and Werewolf genera.  Comparing Underworld to other great movies Underworld falls horribly short to say the least.  Characters weren't well developed or even interesting.  I wanted more related to historical content, much more then providing me with a blurry flashback.  Ok if you like action then this movie will deliver but remember that action doesn't make for a great movie.  It's probably worth your time but not going down in my book as a top ten.  What is worst is this movie was set up for a sequel.  I beg those involved to not waste money of a sequel which will one day be found buried deep in the 4.99 DVD bin.  Also I watched it at the Wynnsong 16 in Knoxville which had it turned up loud enough to hurt my ears and also there was a loud reverberating sound coming from the direction of the screen which was taken care of by saying to me that maybe next time I'll be different. ""?""  To summarize my Underworld experience, if I had to do it all over again I probably would have stayed home and played some WarCraft or rented a DVD.",1064620800,,1450,4.244525547445256
1947863,2,B0000UI2NM,"""Underworld"" has been horribly misrepresented.  It's advertising campaign promised a ""Romeo and Juliet"" love story set among a war between werewolves and vampires.  Instead, the filmmakers have given us a ""Matrix""/""Crow""/""Blade"" rip-off that is light on action, heavy on melodramatics, and big on style.
 Kate Beckinsale is Seline, a death-dealing vampire who has the sole purpose of hunting down the vicious lycans (calling them werewolves would be too nerdy).  Apparently, a war between the two species has been raging for centuries.  The battle strategies of these supernatural beings are most bizarre.  Instead of planning their next attack, the vampires choose to sit around their mansion drinking and looking posh while the lycans wrestle each other in the sewers.  Enter Scott Speedman as Michael, a medical intern who's being hunted by the werewolves for reasons that aren't revealed until the end of the film.  Of course, Seline reaches him first, but not before the clueless chump is bitten by a werewolf.
 This film is much more ""Matrix"" than anything else, and I'm not just talking about the leather outfits or the blazing gun battles or the jumping up really high in the air.  The stories of the two films are identical.  Instead of rebels and machines chasing Neo we have vamps and wolves chasing Speedman.  The problem is that ""Underworld"" is presented on a much lesser scale.  The action scenes are sparse and lack any originality.  At one point they become downright stupid as a vamp soldier fights a werewolf with two whips.  He gets eaten in a few seconds.  Maybe he should have tried two pitchforks or maybe even two unripe bananas. Between the blood and bullets, we are introduced to the various characters of the vampire and lycan clans.  I was much more interested during these moments, mostly because whenever I became bored with the talking heads I turned my attention to the stylish cinematography, the real star of this film.  If anything else, ""Underworld"" makes for great eye candy.  A warning to anyone looking for an epic, forbidden romance set between the travesties of violent conflict: the filmmakers equate the idea of a love story to Beckinsale giving Speedman a peck on the lips.  That's it.  There is no chemistry whatsoever between the two actors.  They barely come into contact with each other.
  Don't you think it's so cool how vampires and werewolves are totally evil, legendary monsters.  Screenwriter Danny McBride doesn't.  His reinterpretations of these classic beasts are of the lamest, failing at almost every point to use their full potential.  Instead of coming out during a full moon, the lycans can change whenever they want.  Silver bullets only work if you use about a hundred of them.  And the wolves are the more formidable of the two species.  The so-called-vampires aren't even really vampires.  They have reflections, don't drink blood, and run away like panicked deer at the first sign of danger.  Without guns, the lycans tear them apart like wet tissue paper.  It seems like the only reason McBride calls them vampires is so that there is an excuse for their gravity-defying stunts.  After having vampires updated with ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and the ""Blade"" films it's a letdown that this is the best McBride could imagine.
 Had ""Underworld"" made its debut a decade ago, it may have been the groundbreaking hit that ""The Matrix"" was.  Having come out now only makes it a rehash of things we've seen before.  Still, the style of the film and some interesting characters save it from being a straight-to-video type disaster.

1947864,1,B0000UI2NM,"This movie makes no sense.....Unless watching a bunch of actors wear nice trendy clothes posing here and there (the vampires) makes sense to anybody else & the plot is so ridiculous you cant help but laugh...This could've been so much more, with the vampire vs werewolf concept and all, somewhere in the terrirory of 'blade II' or something.",1064534400,,341,4.896551724137931
1947865,4,B0000UI2NM,"This film actually gets 3 1/2 stars in my opinion.  As several others have said, this movie could/should have been a lot more.  Two dimensional characters, plot holes, and prolonged gunfights drag the movie down.  Also, as stated in previous reviews, the vampires are ridiculously weak.  Traditionally, vampires would tear the werewolves apart with their bare hands!  This probably did not work with the idea in the movie that the number of werewolves was dwindling, as they would have to outnumber the vampires something like 3 to 1 to even be considered a threat.
Anyways, like I said, too many gunfights.  I desired far more hand to hand combat, a la ""Blade"", but if there's going to be so many gunfights they could have made them at least a bit more acrobatic, as opposed to the characters just standing in place and firing their weapons at each other.
The one redeeming grace in this movie is the visuals.  The moody shades of blue and grey, the Lycan transformations, and the gothic costumes worn by the vampires all help to establish the dark feeling of war between two supernatural races.  Perhaps a sequel is in the works that would help to eradicate this movie's many flaws?  Let's hope so, because the idea of these two warring factions is intriguing still.",1064448000,4,1268,4.7534246575342465
1947866,4,B0000UI2NM,"OK!?  Let's try to break this down calmly.  ... NO WAY!!! I COULDN'T DO THAT IF EVEN IF I TIED MY HANDS AND HAD TO TYPE WITH MY ......""TOUNGE"".
Alright...with all joking aside, this movie was done very well.  Len Wiseman did a fantastic job at giving the audience a belivable movie.  I will not however give this movie five stars.  Basically because of the plot flaws.  I have watched just about every movie that has come out on werewolves, vampires and even mummies ( i know mummies aren't in this movie, but still) my point is, that any true die-hard fan of vampires and werewolves would have wanted the writer and director to have stayed closer to the basic storyline that myself and many other people grew up with.  OKOKOKOK!!  just give me a second to explain before you blindly say that my review was NOT helpful.
Werewolves are supposed to be extrememly allergic to silver.  The way that this movie shows us....i know people in real life who are more allergic to silver than these ...things.  Basically if i shoot a werewolf with a silver bullet, he will whine and cry but he will live as long as he can take them out before a couple hours pass.  If anything else this just gives werewolves a greater edge than what they had before.  Vampires also are not looked at as the damned or evil spawn, but rather people infected with a virus.  Basically meaning that they have a reflection in a miror, and that UV is not as effective as you would think.  The werewolves divise a way to shoot UV bullets.  But when these UV bullets hit a vampire...they just say OW and kinda stumble around.  The same for the vampires...they divised a bullet that has liquid silver nitrate inside...so that when the hit a werewolf the silver goes straight through there bloodstream....but like i said before silver isn't as effective...so instead of instant death...you have the good old slow antagonizing death.
There are a few more plot flaws in this story, but the truth is that i can't really tell you them, because you will hate me for it later.  I can't tell you too much about the movie...because just like the trailer says....who will you choose.  I can tell you that there is a good race and a bad race, you just need to figure that out on your own through the movie.  Enjoy :)",1064448000,,2268,4.487804878048781

Anyway, if you read the book you'll understand that the reflections in the mirror were not a mistake, but a perfectly planned idea.  ...  Kate Beckinsale, I have to say, gave the best performance of her career.  There is going to be a sequel because it is underway right now.  I'm not sure if it'll pick up where the first left off, but the beginning will have something to do with it.  Go see this!",1064361600,,504,4.177083333333333
1947868,3,B0000UI2NM,"As has been elaborated upon dozens of times, the trailer for this baby totally rocked. The movie, not so much. The concept was completely boss. The execution wasn't.

""Underworld"" drops you into this story without so much as a compass to guide you. Important elements in the standard vampire and werewolf mythos - what hurts them, what powers do they have (and apparently the vampires have none!) - are drastically modified, which is fine it itself. But most of these changes are never explained or addressed. You could figure it out on your own if it were not inconsistently applied even within the movie!

Kate Beckinsale is capable and solid and certainly was the perfect choice for the role as it was (probably) originally conceived. But the writing is so sparse that her character is two-dimensional at best. Her Selene is beautiful but not attractive because there is not much of anyone there to care about. Her motivation for hunting the Lycans (and please note the spelling kids - it's based on the word 'lycanthrope') is given not in flashbacks but in brief expository dialogue delivered to the thinnest character in the film - her human 'love interest'. Their relationship is inexplicable.

The movie partially redeems itself with the finale, which is clever and sometimes even original. But it has no emotional payoff because you have so little love for the protagonists.

Bottom line: As a B-grade monster/action flick, it's actually pretty good. It looks incredible. It almost even rises to the level of guilty pleasure. But it could have been SO much more.",1064275200,,1570,4.9356060606060606
1947869,2,B0000UI2NM,"Have you ever read the appendix of an epic novel?  You know the pages near the back of a classic novel like DUNE or LORD OF THE RINGS where a lot of extra information lies.  It let's you in on a thing that happened before the story and tells of kings and queen who ruled the area before the action of the actual story take place.  The new film UNDERWORLD plays like the appendix of a novel.  There's lots of extra information and yet very little substance in and of itself.
UNDERWORLD tells the story of Selene (Kate Beckensale, Pearl Harbor), a vampire, and Michael (Scott Speedman, Duets) a human being chased by the vampire's sworn enemies, a band of Werewolves. Selene job in her vampire clan is to kill said Werewolves, she's known as a death eater.  You see there is a war brewing between the werewolves and the vampires.  It's kind of an undead Hatfield and McCoy story.
Or is it? UNDERWORLD suffers from an intriguing concept and little substance.  There is this huge back-story, that finds its way into the movie and I bet it's figured out pretty concisely.  There talk of history, and legend, and generations of vampire's and werewolves.  But that's all.  Compelling characters take a back seat, to loud and almost obnoxious action sequences and subplots running left and right with nowhere to go.
In fact the only reason the film focuses on Beckensale is because she's the big name star.  She comes and goes at the whim of the screenplay.  In fact I think there was a 20-minute segment near the end that she isn't even in.  The major plot of this film plays like an overlong subplot in a much more epic film or maybe even a two-part episode of a fantasy television series.
In fact that's the only way a film like Underworld can work.  The film is crying out for some focus.  There's a story dying to come out.  It's right there on the surface, and instead of focusing on Selene and her fight to save Michael.  It is bogged down by this silly and overdeveloped history of the war between vampire's and werewolves.  You know what.  This movie would make a great television or comic book series.  It just doesn't work as a stand-alone film.
And yet I can't say I hated UNDERWORLD.  It looks too good.  Its visual style lies somewhere between BATMAN and MINORITY REPORT.  It's set in one of those futuristic cities that are dirty and disgusting, and full of horror.  A city where the sun never shines and humans are food for the children of the night.  If you like really neat eye candy this is the film for you.
It seems like the filmmakers took the lets see how much cool stuff we can jam into the film approach, and most of it works on a purely surface level.  It's only after you realize that if you removed most of the cool scenes you'd have nothing worth watching and that's when the Action sequences begin to grate on you.
I longed for a much better, more fully realized picture than I got with UNDERWORLD.  I wanted cool action sequences, but I also wanted some compelling characters and interesting story developments.  All of which fall flat under the weight of an unfocused and overly melodramatic story.  Do yourself a favor and skip UNDERWORLD.  But as consolation may I suggest you give EQUILBRIUM a try?
**1/2 out of 5",1064275200,2,3240,4.507718696397942
1947870,1,B0000UI2NM,"Ok. Let me just say it & get it out of the way - WORST MOVIE EVER!!
There was so much potential with this movie - what happened?? Did the Editors go nuts and cut everything with substance? Did the producer/director come upon a good idea for a movie, and forget to hire a writer???
Let me address the problems I had with this movie:
1) No character development~! THe main female character kept the SAME expression on her face the ENTIRE movie! {""ooh, he's cute (angry face)"" or ""damn, i've been betrayed! (same angry face)""}
The main male character simply reacted - no background, no character at all. He could have just as easily been added in the last 5 minutes of the movie. THe one character (who was a werewolf) in the movie that starts getting some background and depth - they kill off immediatly. Its almost as if someone was standing by saying ""no wait - we can't have that - people may start to be able to enjoy the movie! Kill him off quick!!""
2) No story! No depth! No sense!! BY the end of the movie, you are wondering what the heck is going on! And by the time you find out - it's still no real explanation - just something thrown at you at the last moment, just to give you an easy answer - even though it doesn't even make sense. During the last epic battle - which is inevitable in this type of movie (i've got NO problem with that, i expected a formulaic type of movie - it's just everything else!) - you don't even know who to route for anymore. And not only that, it's been so slow and painful that you don't care!! You start to think - someone DIE already - JUST END THE PAIN!!
3) Vampires are wussies! Now what's up with that? They can jump from a 30 story building to the ground without messing up their hair; or jump vertically 20 feet and cling to a ceiling - but if attacked, and without a gun, they run. And not just run - but run SLOWLY.
4) Dude's hair! A minor complaint - but still very annoying. You literally never see the main male character's face - his hair is always covering it!! While I have no problem with a grunge look, or in the midst of a fight/heat of the moment mussed hair - for cripes sake - he works at a hospital, and his hair's all over the place!
5) Some bad acting. Not the whole movie, but it's there. In a movie with a strong lead role, strong story, or *some* kind of strength somewhere - it would have gone unnoticed. However - with nothing more than a cool premise, it stood out as just more more thing to ensure this movie would never make it to the ""good flick"" category.
6) Vampire girlie's clothes. While very cool, and while there WERE three outfits, they were so similar that she may as well have only had one. Variety? Hello? Just because she's a vamp doesn't mean she can only dress in one outfit, have one look on her face, or only one stomping walk. (angry look, angry clothes, angry walk) This may seem like a minor complaint, as is the one about the main male character's hair. But again, along with everything else, it gives the overbearing impression that this movie never had a writer - or, if a script was written, it was so badly mangled, edited and changed as to make it completely unrecognizable as a story.
7) NO ENDING. Oh please - leaving it open for a sequel?? THE PAIN NEVER ENDS.
I'd like to add that this movie had really great special effects. The werewolves changing, and the wire-work on the vampires was not only well done, but i'd even go as far as saying they were terrific! WHY oh WHY didn't they put that kind of effort and skill into the script?????
In closing, I have to say I was incredibly disappointed in this movie. I expected formulaic. I expected predictable (boy, was i not let down there!) I even expected it to not get any Emmy nominations. But let me tell you - this movie would make any bad movie look good.
Do yourself a favor. Skip this one. If you see it - see it on video, on a night you are looking for a cheesy B-movie with good special effects.",1064275200,2,3953,4.237086092715232
1947871,2,B0000UI2NM,"The Trailer was inspired, the posters were eye candy, the concept was brilliant. The only strike against it's add campaign was the horrific title the movie chose as its monicker. So where did this little-movie-that-could go wrong? Lets investigate shall we.
Set Design: No problems from this angle. Besides being a bit cliched everything felt right at home. They were dark set pieces that helped set the mood for the battle of the century. Vampires Vs. Werewolves!! ""Only in America"".
Cinematography: Everything is pretty much soaked in this blue-gray color. It has been done many times before. I wish that just one of these movies would just show some color, it's dark, I get it.
Writing: Here, ladies and gentlemen, is the first strike. Many of the lines that these poor thespians must speak are, to say the least, atrocious. It was almost comedic how many cliched lines were just spewed forth. And their was no farce to support these lines, they are spoken with the most serious of tones it becomes almost like a running gag. Unfortunately this is not a comedy and the audience never ""gets"" the joke. Terrible job.
Acting: Strike two! You must care for all of these characters for one reason and for one reason alone: they look really cool in black. Kate runs around emotionless and dull, motivated but strangely lifeless. The rest of this cast just follows the acting 101 lesson of basic emotions. ""Grrr I'm angry."" ""Sniffle I'm sad."" They breathe no life into any part of this sad sad production. Not one vampire ever acts like a vampire. Not one werewolf ever acts  like a werewolf. This shoulda been ""Humans in black leather Vs. Humans without shirts."" Much like the Matrix Reloaded we are merely  teased with the prospect of a true supernatural war of  fantasies most inventive creations.
Direction: This movie had a director? Strike three. The plot goes into all the good cliches of having these creatures really interested in science and technology, yet never show some of the good old methods of killing. These scenes try to fill up the spaces between the times of talking and when things go boom. The action scenes never become exciting. While cloning the matrix it never tries to find its own voice, instead it becomes  the echo of the tried and true nature of todays action where wire-fu and guns equal big box office.  Even equilibrium created the ""gun-kata"" which made it very enjoyable to watch.
I have no vendetta against movies that take inspiration from alot of todays most popular films. But when it chooses never to break out  into an original creation is where I find it boring and a complete waste of time to watch. Their is no satisfying aspect to this movie besides the alluring idea of watching vamps and wolves duke it out. Instead we get boring gun fights that could have been just humans fighting it out in the subway.",1064275200,3,2848,4.743434343434344
1947880,5,B0000UI2NM,"About a day ago, I managed to see ""Underworld"" at the theater, and this is what I think about the film...OUTSTANDING!! ""Underworld"" has so much action, unrelenting suspense, and mind-blowing special effects that make ""Blade"" seem like a walk to grandma's house! With intense direction by first-time director Len Wiseman, ""Underworld"" has an excellent cast led by the lovely Kate Beckinsale (""Cold Comfort Farm"", ""Pearl Harbor"") in what is sure to be one of the best performances ever in her career. Joining Kate are Scott Speedman (""Dark Blue"", ""Duets""), Michael Sheen (""The Four Feathers""), Shane Brolly (""Impostor""), and Bill Nighy (""Love Actually"") in which they, too, gave outstanding performances.
""Underworld"" focuses on a thousand-year war between vampires and werewolves. Centered in the middle of the war is Selene (Beckinsale), a beautiful vampire warrior, or ""Death Dealer"" as she calls herself. She exists solely to slaughter a band of werewolves known as ""Lycans"" that her clan has been battling for centuries. Although she is aligned with the vampires, Selene falls for a human turned werewolf named Michael Corvin (Speedman) after she discovers a Lycan plot to kidnap him. When the Lycans try to make their next move on Michael, Selene is there to fend off their vicious assault. As Selene races to save Michael and unravel the Lycan plot, Selene then discovers a secret that has terrifying repercussions for both tribes -- a secret which threatens to tip the balance of power in favor of the werewolves who have been on the losing of the struggle for centuries. And as far as Selene goes, she must decide if her future with Michael is worth betraying her own people.
In conclusion, ""Underworld"" has it all! Great action, a powerful storyline, and a pulsating soundtrack that is sure to please just about anyone looking for a spectacular action film. And I especially can't wait for the sequel, especially since the end of ""Underworld"" was left wide open for one! ""Underworld"" is, without a doubt, a DVD must-have to my Kate Beckinsale collection! And all I have to say is ""Look out, Angelina Jolie!

I won't go into the whole story in detail (because it's obviously been covered in other reviews), but I found it a very good adaptation of Romeo and Juliet.  Throw in some intrigue, some betrayal, good special effects and great action, and you have a really great movie.
Why only four stars?  Well, while the director treated the Lycans very close to mythological rules (one in particular was like a force of nature when he changed), he seemed to forget all about what vampires are about, except in a few critical scenes.  Why do the vampires need flashlights when the lights go off in the Manor?  Aren't they supposed to be able to see in the dark?  Vampires are supposed to have inhuman speed and strength, at least a match for the Lycans--except most of the time seemed to move with only human speed.  The mirror reflection is minor stuff next to some of the other rules that seemed completely forgotten about.

The whole story leads up to the creation of a ""being"" which is supposed to be strong, but looks weak, and is designed horribly.
The transformations of the werewolves was good the first time, when it was done mostly in the dark.  After that they were too bright and didn't look so good.  Kate Beckinsale did a beautiful job, and I would still say it's worth seeing in the theaters for her role, but maybe only a matinee ticket.  The music was good without being distracting, the dialogue was structured well, but not always delivered well.

I enjoyed the trailer so much that I downloaded the 33M full screen version from the Underworld web site. I was hoping the movie would live up to the promise of the trailer... and wasn't disappointed. I was surprised how much of a story was included. The plot took some turns I didn't expect which made it more interesting. I thought it would be primarily special effects and a lame store. Granted there were more guns than necessary. I would have liked to see more organic fighting and less technology. There were a few interesting twists to the standard methods for killing werewolves and vampires. Some tension between two characters that wasn't explained thoroughly (maybe cut scenes?) but the ending left the door open for a sequel where they could explain more.

Kate Beckinsale was fine; Shane Brolly as her sexist leader were dreadful. Scott Speedman (one can't judge his skill because he had nothing to do) had the worst part of all, the MacGuffin--or plot mover. He was just tossed around until his big stunt double fight scene at the end.
As for plot, the motivation was right out of an afternoon serial. These are creatures of supposed mythic proportions at the end of a centuries old battle...for this? oh, please...

The primary focus of the movie becomes Selene's quest to discover why the Lycans want Corvin so badly, as well as expose a conspiracy (actually several conspiracies) among her own people.

On the edge of my seat, biting my nails as I eagerly waited to hear news about the third Matrix movie, or maybe the second Resident Evil, I saw a trailer for Underworld.
I kept going back to the website, watching the trailer over and over, until the day came it was in theatres. I rushed off to see it.
The story focuses on a war thats been raging for about one thousand years between vampires, and the Lycans (werewolves). The vampires no longer hunt to feed, and instead drink cloned blood from their own company.
The Lycans are, apparently, brutal, man-slaughtering beasts, and now, the full moon no longer having control over them, can transform at will from human to werewolf and vice versa.
Caught in the middle is a man named Michal. After rescuing Selene, a Death Dealer who makes it her duty to help her fellow vampires hunt down the Lycans, he is taken back to the other vampires.
They discover he's a Lycan, and he has to escape.
Selene is ordered to kill Michal. Struggling with her emotions, she must also solve a mystery that seems to be making the purpose of the war a whole lot clearer...
All in all, this is an amazing movie. Worth your time, I assure you. A great story, amazing special effects (I adore the werewolf transformations -- and the werewolves themselves!), and plenty of action to keep you on the edge of your seat and begging for more.

1947888,5,B0000UI2NM,"I did not go to this movie with especially high expectations.  In fact, I read plenty of professional reviews trashing this film prior to seeing it.  I was just looking forward to a fun movie to forget about the stresses of life for about 2 hours.  And to that effect, ""Underworld"" succeeds extraordinarily.  It's true that oscar material it ain't, but damn was it entertaining.  Underworld is the quintessential ""guilty pleasure"" movie.  I walked out of the theatre with a big smile and feeling not a little guilty for being so entertained by such a ""stupid"" movie.
  Regardless, Underworld sports some of the most stylish cinematography I have ever seen in any movie.  Every action and backdrop is meticulously crafted for maximum suaveness.  The film depicts an alternate, dark world just slightly out of kilter with ours, so that we get to see something different from everyday life without the ""world"" being too farfetched.  The action sequences are all taut and well done.
  The movie provides some good new ideas for the vampire and werewolf mythologies.  I especially loved the idea of vampires using laptops, cell phones, and automatic weapons to keep up wtih times.  I mean, we would expect them to, no?  Unfortunately, some old favourites of vampire lore were not presented in the film.  Apparently vampires have reflections in mirrors, and breathe according to this movie.  And not enough emphasis was put on the blood-drinking nature of vampires in general, which was so central to films like ""Interview with the Vampire"" (the greatest vampire flick of all time).
  The werewolf effects were not spectacular, but they were sufficient.  The director had to good sense of relegating our canine friends mostly to the dark, knowing that in full light, CGI characters look absurdly fake.
  Yes, I went to see Underworld primarily for Kate Beckinsale, and I was not disappointed.  She was hella, hella hot in this movie.  Well, she's just beautfiul in general, but there's something about the blue vampire-eyes and ultra-chic costumes that makes her a delight to watch.  This is certainly a whole other side to Kate compared with Serendipity.  She makes a very satisfying action hero.  I think Kate Beckinsale's Selene is the first of those independent female ""girl-power"" action heros that I actually like.  I'll take her over any of those Charlie's Angels any day, that's for sure.
  Plot holes?  Yes, Underworld is overflowing with them.  But who cares?  The plot is indeed woefully convoluted, but includes many clever twists to keep the audience guessing and amused.  All in all, if you're in the mood for a ""turn-off-your-brain"" supernatural rollarcoaster, Underworld is a pretty good bet.",1064102400,18,2702,5.049886621315193
1947889,4,B0000UI2NM,"I like monster movies. I watch alot of them. and underworld is a very good example of the genre.
The Special effects were used very effectivly to support the plot not overwhem it.  As I have seen the movie twice there are lots of little details that made the movie even more enjoyable the second time.
PLEASE note this is an action movie not a romance. there is a very light undertone of attraction but rather than push it they stayed true to their characters and kept it low key. There maybe more love interest in the sequel. There is definatly enough depth to this world and enough loose threads to make it worthwhile.
The only reason I rated it 4 instead of 5 is I want to see the extras on the dvd. there is more to this story and I can't wait to see it.
Bottom line- Go see the movie but don't expect epic romance expect a heroine who's world is about to turn upsidedown",1064102400,2,875,4.208333333333333
1947890,4,B0000UI2NM,"If you think this looks cool, go see it.  I'm not going to give this away, but the movie does get better as it unfolds.  In fact, it's ... a political power play which keeps you guessing.  The characters of Viktor by Bill Nighy and Erika by Sophia Myles are the better vampire performances in a decade.  Viktor is a true badass and Erika is a cunning goddess.  The story twists and turns; the ending was left open.  Most of the actors and actresses are British, so it has a different flavor than say Blade or Queen of the Damned.",1064102400,,529,4.24
1947891,2,B0000UI2NM,"This movie, while it had some promise, failed miserably to deliver. The story of vampires fighting werewolves was resonable enough, even though werewolves do seem to have the advantage of daylight. This is the first movie that I have seen that have made werewolves thinking creatures. In vampire mythology, they have no reflection, do not cast a shadow, have superior hearing and sight and incredible strength. Not in this version.
It turned out to be a love story. Part one of a love story.",1064102400,2,491,4.857142857142857
1947892,5,B0000UI2NM,"This is a great movie.  I'm not sure it is one of the best movies of this type ever made, but it is VERY good.
It starts out by prefacing the war between the Lycans and Vampires over the centuries and brings you into the modern day world.  There appears to be some hope in combining the blood lines of each species to create a super species, stronger together than each alone.  This movie also explores, very nicely I might add, how the ""war"" unfolded and kind of reminded me of the ""Seventh Sign"" where the flashbacks deal with what is happening in the current day.
This movie is filled with deceptions, decadence and subplots galore.  There is a power struggle between the two leading Vampire females for control of the coven.  There is struggle between the Lycan warriors.  There is a power struggle between Craven, the current vampire coven leader and Victor, the resurrected ancient vampire leader.  There is enough action to keep it moving along nicely.
The music was very dark, brutal and a true showing of what goth music is all about.  Although the theatre I was in had it almost too loud, a pair of light plugs might have been in order.
All in all, I don't see why people are knocking this film.  Maybe they got them selves overhyped.  Some critics have also compared this to the Matrix: Reloaded.  They couldn't be more wrong.  This movie stands on its own and it's well worth the two hours and you'll leave wishing you had either of the powers shown in the movie.  I guess that's what the director's had intended.  :)",1064102400,4,1529,4.512727272727273
1947893,4,B0000UI2NM,"Ok, to start off, I'm not going to bag on this movie for not having better developed characters, nor will I complain about the changes in the ""monster mythology"". Intead, I'd like to focus on its high points. I must admit, for a low-budget movie, $22 million if I remember correctly, this was definately a quality movie. I came into the theater expecting it to be a Romeo and Juliette, let's kill some werewolves, slapped together movie, but I came out impressed with how there was so much more to this well thought out plotline than met the eye. And, for it's budget, it had some really well done special effects. Granted, some people may complain about the acting, but I really didn't find that much of a problem with it. I do wish it would have explained more of the background, but it was definately left open for sequels, so maybe they'll cover that in those. So before you decide to just wait for it to come out on DVD, give it a chance and see it in the theaters, and even though it isn't the greatest movie of all time, it's been better than most movies I've seen in the past few months, and it makes for an enjoyable experience.",1064102400,2,1137,4.367924528301887
1947894,4,B0000UI2NM,"Where do I sign up to be bitten?  Interesting movie--great, GREAT cinematography and costumes.  If Kate Beckinsale didn't own you before she will now.
Judging from the ending, a sequel is inevitable.  Hopefully the plot holes (and there were many) will be ironed out for the sequel.
Good clean Gothic fun.",1064102400,,305,4.9411764705882355
1947895,2,B0000UI2NM,"Vampires, werewolves, black leather, heavy metal music, jumping from high places, and walking down hallways very dramatically. Thats about all you can say for Underworld. A kind of new idea (though still quite cliched) but this film turned out to be a Blade/Matrix wannabe. Everyone wears tight black leather with long black trench coats and guns with weird bullets. And so begins the vampire vs. werewolf war! For hundreds of years the vamps and lykens (werewolves) have been at war. The head of each group have been at each others throat forever and now the fight is more important than ever. The lykens are searching for a human that holds the blood that can be used to mix both species to create a very powerful beast. Thats most of the plot right there. The rest of the movie looks to be a way to show off special effects and just how many times they can open the double doors with one motion (which is a lot!). Kate Beckinsale did do a show a good performance but thats about it. The movie really fell short of my expectations. Theres not much else I can say, a lot of corny lines and actions (but it is a vampire movie so you cant blame it too much), and a whole two hours of disappointment.",1064016000,4,1198,4.425339366515837
1947896,3,B0000UI2NM,"It was fairly easy to guess that this wasn't going to be the must-see that its trailer promised, but Underworld is at least a little more substantial than, oh, about 80% of the big summer blockbusters I've had the misfortune to sit through this year.  I'll give it that, anyway..
The main word that sprang to mind after seeing it was... well, 'odd'.  Odd that anyone would make the choices they made in editing, in casting, in scripting and plot, after all the obvious work that has gone into backstory for this particular fantasy world.  The trailer, surely one of the most enticing for a long time, remains a vision of what this film could have been - and I'm convinced this would have been pretty good, had a decent script editor and film editor been let near it before release.
What struck me somewhere near the end was the sheer *laziness* that went into the promo line quoted in every review: ""Romeo and Juliet with vampires and werewolves"".  Right. Has anyone quoting that line: a) have any knowledge of Shakespeare's plot in one of its hundred incarnations or b) actually watched Underworld?  The emotional heart of this film is fairly cold, distant, and pretty damn unromantic.  I have never seen anything so sold as having a major romantic element, and so absolutely shying away from the subject. Its not so much done badly so much as not done at all; I have never seen anything less like a grand romance in my life!!  Just a warning...
Still, there's fun to be had in spotting the movies that director Len Wiseman liked in the past few years... As much as Matrix paid homage to Dark City stylistically, so Underworld sneaks in as many little Matrix tributes as it can reasonably manage (the modem-sound backing music, the old-fashioned phone ring, all those long black leather coats, a lobby-scene wannabe, yada yada yada).  Kinda cute, in a way... sadly, these are more like the original Matrix than the overblown Reloaded could manage, but that's another story altogether...
Like most of the lead characters, Kate Beckinsdale is pretty much wasted playing Selene,the kinda vamp Buffy could stake in her sleep.. never have vampires been so.. well, useless, as they  are here! Jumping off tall buildings gracefully and firing guns are pretty much all their talents, but the Lycans get to do all that and way, way more.  Bit of a shame, really.  Beckinsdale goes for an 'Angel without the wisecracks' performance, which just adds to the general gloom - the character really is weak - and irritatingly stupid on occasion.  Scott Speedman coasts through looking dazed and confused, while the actor playing Kraven manages to wreck every scene he's in - and that's quite a few - by being the only American vampire in a cast of Brits.  Thats all well and good, but his clenched teeth acting and strange, strange accent contrived to make me cringe whenever he showed up.  Near the end, he lapses into an odd Scottish accent (shades of the embarrassingly bad Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle at that point) which just serves to confuse more... weird.
Kudos to Bill Nighy, even if he does pretty much sleepwalk through the role of Viktor, and especial praise to Michael Sheen, who can console himself from getting dumped by the leading lady with the thought that he pretty much carried the movie.  Great actor, the only character with any depth, and a joy to watch.  Interesting...
All in all, it's a film thats been marketed better than its been put together, but the sheer amount of potential there drags it through.  It's damn good to look at most of the time (it may help if you turn your brain off during most of the plot exposition; it's less painful that way) and if immortals in leather coats and fabulous dresses with lots of guns are your idea of fun, you can't go far wrong here.  In my humble opinion, it's more watchable than most of the films I've sat through this year (Yes, that's you, Matrix Reloaded, Charlie's Angels 2, Tomb Raider 2, X-Men2 and the excruciating Daredevil).  It's a shame that it sacrifices an ending to what amounts to a plea for a sequel (and a sad little plea at that) but the SFX are impressive and there are flashes of brilliance throughout.  No, it doesn't live up to the trailer, but here's hoping they greenlight a sequel that actually learns from its mistakes...!",1064016000,2,4309,4.697211155378486
1947897,3,B0000UI2NM,"I'm not going to delve into the story line as others have already done that. Overall, I enjoyed this movie. At 121 minutes long this movie seems that it was limited in how much of a story it could tell. The film makers are tasked with explaining brand new societies of vampires and wherewolves including new rules (which I don't mind... these are FANTASY characters afterall) and unfortunatley character developement did not get all of the screen time that it should have gotten. The visual feel of the movie was great, almost Gothamesque and the soundtrack matched the film perfectly. The Audio / Visual effects were very good too.
I sincerly hope that a extended DVD will be released with 30 minutes more footage to explain the story a little better.
Still, after seeing this movie last night I felt that my money was well spent. In its present form... this is a entertaining movie.",1064016000,3,884,4.709677419354839
1947898,4,B0000UI2NM,"Well, I will begin by saying that I thought this movie was stunning to look at.  The make-up, special fx's, and fight scenes were amazing.  Like many others the story itself had a few problems, but I still enjoyed the movie and will probably see it again and definitely buy the DVD when it's available.
I saw this movie again and liked it better the second time.  The movie is fast paced and I missed a few things the first time.  I still can't get over the look of this movie the special Fx's are absolutely fabulous.  As for the story I think they cut it a little too deeply for my taste I'd have liked a longer story with some more information, but it was the best vampire/werewolf story I have seen since Brotherhood of the Wolf.",1064016000,,733,4.282608695652174

It was dark, rainy, fast paced, interesting story line that really makes you want to get to the core of it, thight leather clothes, flying, shooting, running, picturesque fighting sequences.
I'm glad i saw it, don't let them tell you otherwise.
