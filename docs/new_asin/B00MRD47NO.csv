Through the movie, you also 'see' some of the Philippine culture/the people and their respective dreams - BTW, the country's beautiful beaches. Almost want to give a 4.5 star because of the background sound quality. But considering this is Ken Au's first movie, he did a fantastic job!! Good luck!",1412035200,5,454,4.833333333333333
8674257,4,B00MRD47NO,"It's a really good indie film. Acting is raw. Very original and the chemistry between the two actors are great. Could've been better if they explored the relationship between the two more other than the goodbye scene but other than that, very entertaining especially from a philippine cinema.",1523750400,,292,5.104166666666667

8674259,5,B00MRD47NO,"A really enjoyable movie! It was well written, directed and filmed, and the acting by the two leads was funny, thoughtful and, above all, believable. Being Filipino-American myself, I grew up watching a lot of Filipino movies that tend to be formulaic, overacted and far too melodramatic for their own good. But this was a breath of fresh air! The last two minutes did seem to be tacked on and unnecessary -- would have been an even better movie without. But I'm giving it five stars because I think it deserves better than the 3 1/2 star rating that I've been seeing here, and it's worth watching.",1504396800,4,598,4.598130841121495

8674262,4,B00MRD47NO,I like it.  You'll fall in love with them and their story and the place too.  A story of two heartbroken individual strangers that after spending time touring places eventually fell in love with each other.,1482969600,2,206,4.694444444444445
8674263,2,B00MRD47NO,"The first thing that hits you in this movie is a beautiful beach. The second, two good-looking filipinas. And then, things go downhill fast. A young man appears with his fashionable stubble and sunglasses. I take a dislike to him and his arrogant ways even before I notice how bad an actor he is. As is everyone in this movie. As for the storyline? You know the one girl with singing ambitions and the arrogant guy will make a pair, and you realize you are not interested one way or the other. And that you are equally not interested in following this utterly predictable scenario, which will undoubtedly include the girl winning a singing competition. So, why watch any more of this movie? I did not.",1477180800,,701,4.571428571428571
