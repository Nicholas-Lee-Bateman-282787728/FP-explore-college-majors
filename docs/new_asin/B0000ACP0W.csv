8464704,4,B0000ACP0W,"Item was brand new. Your price was a great reduction from the original cost. I am enjoying the tapes and am glad I bought them. (no more rewinding, fast forwarding, etc.) The 4 stars (rather than 5) is a reflection of the content of the tapes, which are simply a repeat of Tony Little's exercises in his tapes/DVDs of the past. A little disappointing on his part, not yours.",1265587200,,374,4.434782608695652
