8397870,5,B003J7Z40M,"I've owned the VHS tape since the early 1990s and play it for students every year. This is a delightful performance! The singing isn't perfect, but the casting, staging, acting are excellent: i.e. the staging brings out the humor of the libretto and music beautifully. My only complaint is that it was never turned into a DVD.",1494460800,,326,4.7368421052631575
