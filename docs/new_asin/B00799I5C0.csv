8512624,5,B00799I5C0,"Space Battleship Yamato is absolutely Amazing on Blu-Ray.  This is the uncut version with all the episodes.  I couldn't believe how clean the picture quality is too.  The sound quality is great for the age of the anime.  The box is about half the size of a cigar box and comes with pictures, a book, and some nice bonus material.  The Blu-Ray does not include English OR Japanese subtitles, but if you're actually considering buying this you probably already know the English story very well.  The Japanese version has a lot more deaths in it.  You can simply read the episode synopsis online if you get lost in translation.  This set is awesome and the anime is beautiful.  I bought it new from Amazon Japan for about $300.  It's worth every penny.  It'll be watched many more times.",1378598400,5,784,4.608695652173913
