As such, I cannot comment on the quality of the product offered on this product page - my review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.

Just a bit above average, 'Go Kill and Come Back' (aka 'Any Gun Can Play'), is a lighter approach to the Italian western from director Enzo Castellari; full of nods to the genre and which also pays homage to the films and filmmakers that came before it.  In a storyline that may seem familiar, three men, each with partial knowledge concerning the location of $300,000 in gold, cross and double-cross one another in an effort to be the first to the hidden treasure.  After several twists and turns, blind dodges and red herrings, the three meet up in front of the gold and contemplate how it should be divided - but nobody does long division in an Italian western without using a gun as a calculator!

'Go Kill' gets a definite recommend for fans of the genre, although, as I said, it's only above average instead of a classic.  The script is actually pretty good - at first, I thought it was too derivative until I understood it was meant as a compliment (and maybe a bit of a spoof) to earlier films.  But Enzo Castellari's direction has always seemed to miss some important element to me, something that would elevate his films from just good to great.  His method of direction is, I think, too much by the numbers - the excellent exception to this is the prologue to 'Go Kill', which finds room for that odd and quirky moment that directors like Sergio Sollima and Sergio Leone were able to stuff into their films.

But the main problem with this film is that only Gilbert Roland, as the bandit leader Monetero, has the charisma necessary to carry his role.  These films call for larger than life characters, and Edd 'Kookie' Byrnes is too lightweight to believably compete with the others.  George Hilton, as the bounty hunter, too often looks as though he is laughing inside at the entire endeavor - I like him better here than in 'I am Sartana...Trade Your Guns for a Coffin', but his acting style is similar in both films.  If you've appreciated his work in previous westerns, chances are you will like his performance here also.

While 'Go Kill' is unrated, and has its share of violent moments, all in all it is subdued in comparison to other Italian westerns I've seen.  I would be tempted to call it PG, though depending on how you may feel about western violence, PG-13 may be more appropriate.  There are gunfights, of course, and fistfights, but this movie doesn't revel in bloodshed or sadistic behavior like a Corbucci film might.  Three and a half stars, and recommended for genre enthusiasts.

I've posted this review under the VHS listing, because the copy that I watched looks a lot like a videocassette - one that was re-recorded over several times before taping this film from television, and then left to percolate in the floorboards of someone's truck for several weeks.  Much of the time, I'd recommend these box sets with their versions of obscure films over the individually packaged DVD - usually the price is right, and it would give someone an idea is the more expensive version is worth picking up.  But I wouldn't recommend 'The Grindhouse Experience' to anyone looking only for this film - it cost too much unless one was interested in other films included in the set, and is in poor condition.  Although I haven't seen it, I'd suggest investigating&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spaghetti-Western-Double-Feature-Vol-2-Bullet-for-Sandoval-Any-Gun-Can-Play/dp/B0032M1926/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spaghetti Western Double Feature Vol 2: Bullet for Sandoval / Any Gun Can Play</a>&nbsp;if your interested in this film - according the information posted on its product page, it sounds as though it may be the best value overall.",1297814400,,4032,4.9525222551928785
