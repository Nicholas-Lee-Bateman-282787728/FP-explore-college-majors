5053635,3,B0073YUJDE,"The quality of the DVD was great, and also the price.  The movie was not the best that I have ever seen, but it was okay.",1341792000,,121,3.6538461538461537
5053636,5,B0073YUJDE,"My husband and I love this movie SO much that we have had three ""showings"" as a treat of the movie we purchased with family & friends at our house!  Which also means my husband and I have watched the movie at least four times since we purchased it!",1337817600,,248,4.061224489795919
5053637,5,B0073YUJDE,"This movie just sucks you right in so that when you think you know what to expect next, it grabs you in a different way.  Great movie, similar to Hitchcock thrillers with its darkness.",1335657600,2,184,4.411764705882353
5053638,5,B0073YUJDE,This is a good independent film dealing with drunk driving.  I believe it deals with the torment one would go through if they where effected by a loose of a family member to a drunk driver in a very unique way.  I highly recommend this film.  It has potential to make a difference in a very serious social problem (Driving while intoxicated).,1335657600,,342,4.483870967741935
5053639,1,B0073YUJDE,"I don't comment on movies very often, but watched this loser on DVD last night. Your first clue is it never appeared in the theatre. I feel almost compelled to spoil the sappy ending to save people from wasting their money. The problem with the movie is it masquerades as a tense hostage drama but in reality is nothing more than a video lecture on the evils of drinking and driving. The dialog is boring and the drama is minimal. If you think this movie is going to be like the Liam Neeson movie ""Taken"" think again. Think about the worst movie you have even watched. This one will be up there with it.",1335657600,4,603,4.298245614035087
5053640,4,B0073YUJDE,very great lesson film better than expected,1511654400,,43,5.285714285714286
5053641,2,B0073YUJDE,This seems like a movie you would have to watch in a high school health class on the dangers of driving drunk.  I almost stopped watching about 20 minutes in but decided to continue because of the high ratings Amazon was giving me.  I thought maybe any minute it was going to change tone completely from the bad acting and cheesy delivery to a real performance.  It never did.  I don't understand how people can think this was a good one.,1510876800,,438,4.37037037037037

5053643,4,B0073YUJDE,"Surprisingly good. The movie was suspenseful and had a good story but the ending was really a nice touch. A story of forgiveness amidst tragedy. Trust the reviews on this one, it's worth a watch.",1510617600,,195,4.6
5053644,4,B0073YUJDE,"It is very good with something that changes everyone's life involved with one blind turn. I would have given 5 stars had it not been a little far fetched. No spoilers here but after watching it, you will see what I mean.",1508976000,,220,4.261904761904762

5053646,5,B0073YUJDE,"All I can say is WOW! This is a B film so didn't know what to really expect but was pleasantly surprised with how well this played out. The acting was good and you get pulled in hanging on the edge of your seat. It's very deep and intense and thoroughly enjoyed it. I highly recommend checking this film out! Oh, and let me add that you'll never see the ending coming!",1438905600,,368,4.125

8509551,5,B0073YUJDE,"I was hesitant to watch this but the ending made all the difference in the world, at first I was thinking a typical revenge type movie but again the ending made a HUGE impact, really good movie in my opinion.",1513123200,,208,4.225
8509552,4,B0073YUJDE,"Surprisingly great movie IF you watch it to the end.  If you only watch it for 30 minutes, as did a disappointed reviewer, then I can see why it would not resonate.

This is a movie driven by plot and character, not action and effects.",1512691200,2,235,4.2
8509553,5,B0073YUJDE,We enjoyed this somewhat suspenseful film.,1512691200,,42,6.166666666666667
8509554,2,B0073YUJDE,"I listened to the reviews, so I watched it for about 30 minutes.  I couldn't take anymore of it.  I could not get into it.  Watch it if you are bored out of your skull, with nothing else to do, perhaps.",1512518400,,202,3.8780487804878048
