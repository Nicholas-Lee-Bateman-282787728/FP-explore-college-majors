326494,5,6301394747,"Nothing Sacred is often referred to as a screwball comedy. Granted it has Carole Lombard the ultimate screwball heroine and other elements which suggest this form of comedy. However, it does not in the end so much resemble films like Bringing up Baby as it anticipates the later satires of Preston Sturges. Whichever way it is classified though, Nothing Sacred remains one of the best comedies of the thirties or indeed of any era.
This film, with its story of an apparently dying young woman, has an added poignancy for viewers watching it today. Lombard would be dead by 1942 and a real national heroine also with a navy warship named after her. The fiction at times seems to look ahead to the fact and thus the story becomes moving as well as funny.
The print of the film on this Lumivision DVD is on the whole good.  There are some scenes especially at the beginning of the film where the early Technicolor print has been damaged. This means that there is some flickering and some separation of the colours. For the most part however, the film looks almost perfect with the vibrant colours so typical of thirties Technicolor. It is a joy to see Carole Lombard in colour and something of a surprise also, for her hair looks redder than expected. There are one of two slight jumps where the continuity of the film has been broken and this may account for the running time of the film, at 73 minutes, being slightly shorter than that listed in some sources.
The extras on this DVD are welcome but rather disappointing. The two Sennett short comedies are not very funny and really show that he had not moved on at all from his early pioneering days. These shorts are of interest mainly because they allow us to see a young and barely recognizable Lombard toiling away in her pre-stardom days. The DVD also includes a very damaged trailer for Nothing Sacred and some interesting if rather brief home movies with Lombard and Gable.",984960000,23,1929,4.623906705539358
326495,5,6301394747,"A screwball satire that was a huge success in 1937. Ben Hecht, who wrote the script, has the ""little people"" dripping crocodile tears over a girl they think is dying of radium poisoning (and enjoying every minute of it). There are classic sequences: March, the New York City sophisticate, arrives in a small New England town and learns how the natives feel about strangers when a little boy runs up and bites his leg - the swozzled Lombard passes out while showgirls (impersonating the heroines of history) parade in her honour - plus the terrific slugging match between March and Lombard. Walter Connoly is great as the dyspeptic big-city editor as is Charles Winninger as the alcoholic small-town doctor. William Wellman's direction is more leisurely than usual; he has such good material here, that he takes his time. This marvelous black comedy classic was originally filmed in Technicolor and the DVD print is clear and sharp! Lombard is priceless in her interpretation of Hazel Flagg; her zestful playing is freshly modern and one can see what all the fuss concerning her comedic gifts was about!",958694400,2,1102,4.962162162162162
326496,5,6301394747,"Nothing Sacred is a really funny movie.  Carole Lombard is the perfect comediane and Frederic March makes a good transformation from his normal dramatic roles.  This is a hilarious movie that no one should miss.  Don't  judge this one by the Lewis/Martin remake that is absulutely ludicrous!  I  liked the part where March is trying to make Lombard look like she has  pnemonia so he punching her and stuff and says, ""I love you, (punches  an ice pack off her head) I'm gonna marry you, and I don't want to spend my  honnymoon blowing kisses to you outside the prison excersice yard!""  Or something like that.  Watch this movie, you won't be disapointed.  I  must agree that Lombard would've made a good Lucy Ricardo.",949708800,4,716,4.67741935483871

I'm sure the French prefer the Jerry Lewis  remake of this, but Sacre Merde!, how could they! March is tough and tender  here, and is especially excellent in the scenes in which he goes to that  small Vermont town to get the exclusive interview with the girl he thinks  is dying of radium poisoning. Watch for the little tyke who takes a bite  out of March's tuchas. Lombard is Lombard, or in other words, she's  glorious, silly, sexy, and I'd have loved to have seen her play Lucy  Ricardo!!

He takes her to New York where she is hailed as an inspiration of courage by the whole town....but her little white lie eventually comes back to haunt her and she and Wally must find a way out.

It's not a long movie but it's so funny and cute and Lombard is truly hilarious...her comic genius really shines in here. March, usually a dramatic actor, is also quite funny in here. Definitely recommend it.",1396483200,,694,4.464566929133858

326509,4,6301394747,"My husband and I are fans of Carole Lombard's work, but often a bit let-down by the plots of her films.  She was just such a fine actress (dramatic and comedic) and it's a pity she had so many sub-wonderful vehicles.

""Nothing Sacred"" is funny, and moves along apace, but it isn't a great film, in my opinion.  There's just not enough there, though it does provide 75-minutes of worthwhile entertainment.

The story concerns a newspaper reporter who was disgraced by his last big scoop when it turned out that he, his editor, and New York at large were bamboozled by a fraud.  He's desperate to redeem himself by locating and interviewing an elusive young woman in Vermont who has been told she's dying of radium poisoning.  This being a comedy, all is not as it appears and silliness results.

It's a fun picture and the actors are all superb.  It's just not a great comedy like ""The Palm Beach Story"" or ""The Awful Truth"", but well worth the seven dollars I paid for it and far better than many another comedy, old or new.",1369699200,,1024,4.4972972972972975

326511,2,6301394747,"Fredric March plays Wally Cook, a reporter who has been disgraced by falling for a swindle. The swindle, by the way, shows the racial stereotyping so typical of movies in the 1930s. In an attempt to redeem himself, he goes to Warsaw, Vermont, to interview Hazel Flagg (Carole Lombard) a pretty girl who is supposedly dying of radon poisoning. Oddly, the watch factory which is the main economic base of the town, and the rather obvious connection to radon painted on ""glow in the dark"" watch dials, is never mentioned beyond the one line. Never mentioned as the source of the radon.

Anyway, just before Cook arrives, Hazel learns that her doctor made a mistake, and she is not dying of radon poisoning after all. She's very glad, of course, but also a little disappointed because she was planning to spend the money the town had raised for her on a trip to New York, to ""see the world."" So when Cook arrives and offers her a trip, including a ride on an airplane, she decides not to tell him she's not really dying. In fact, she insists her rather alcoholic doctor comes along.

You see where this is going at least a quickly as the audience does. It's a very silly, highly implausible story which is supposed to be funny. Only thing is, I find lies, deceit and fraud hard to laugh at.

One highlight: the drugstore in Warsaw, Vermont, is run by none other than Margaret Hamilton, the Wicked Witch of the West.",1336694400,2,1411,4.525490196078431
326512,3,6301394747,"Unfortunately, the quality of the DVD of the classic Selznick film, ""Nothing Sacred"" with Carol Lombard and Frederick March is not what it could be.  While the picture is an
interesting period piece done in the style of ""screwball comedy"" the film print that it was copied from isn't what it should have been and wasn't restored, that I can tell, for
this DVD transfer.  The film shows surface scratches throughout which I am sure are on the original negative and probably can't be economically fixed without full digital
restoration.  This is an example of studios in the 1930's making a number of prints directly off of the original negative; not a good practice.  The comedy is cute and the
over the top characterizations, including Miss Lombard, are fascinating to be able to see after so many years from its era of production.  The comedy is a newspaper story
concerning getting a human interest story about a young terminally ill woman.  Everything is done to make her last days memorable and to honor her life until, that is, it
is revealed that she isn't dying after all.  I was interested in getting to see some of Carol Lombard's famous work, not much of which is available to be seen and enjoyed.
For that purpose the DVD is fine, but the film print it was made from is sadly deteriorating, and I would rate it as a B+ at best.  ""Nothing Sacred"" is a cute period comedy
that will please Carol Lombard or Frederick March fans or anyone interested in early cinema.",1300233600,,1473,4.616858237547893
326513,5,6301394747,"If ever a DVD needed the painstaking care of a Criterion Collection-style makeover, then this classic Selznick production is it. The combination of Ben Hecht's verbal zingers, William Wellman's visual gags, and Oscar Levant's majestic score demand a better airing than the abominably scratchy public-domain copies now available from many independent distributors.

As to the film itself, ""Nothing Sacred"" is a marvellous newspaper satire that skewers every golden idol in the books. Carole Lombard stars as Hazel Flagg, the ""doomed heroine"" who fakes radium poisoning and takes the citizens of 1937 New York for a ride. Fredric March plays the ace reporter who socks her in the jaw before being smitten himself. The supporting cast is a Who's Who of the screwball-comedy genre: Walter Connolly appears as newspaper editor Oliver Stone, Charles Winnegar is Hazel's dipso father, and in a surprisingly humorous cameo, Margaret Hamilton steals one scene by simply rocking back and forth in an old chair, barking ""Yep"" or ""Nope.""

Critics used to label such films as hard-boiled. But by today's standards, there's heavy armor surrounding that yolk -- a reporter's leg is bitten by a growling boy on all fours, a newspaper containing sentimental poetry is used to wrap fish, and a mournful photo of the poisoning victim is displayed over a deli sign advertising ""all kinds of cheese and bologna."" Will someone please re-master this gem?",1297555200,,1431,5.217391304347826

326515,4,6301394747,"Nothing Sacred, 1937 film

This Technicolor film has a script by Ben Hecht (""The Front Page""). It begins with a view of a tall building in New York city. Newspaper reporter Wallace Cook is being honored. A Sultan offers a donation. Is there a hoax here? Will this reporter get a new assignment? A factory girl is dying from radium poisoning. Is there a story here? This company town is under tight control. No NY reporters are wanted there. The people there are as cold as the climate. Are the people there ""quaint""? [This is a comedy.] Hazel Flagg gets a corrected diagnosis; is she happy? Wallace Cook will take her to NY city in a DC-3. We see a view of lower Manhattan, then. There is a celebration for Hazel Flagg with much publicity. How much is phony there? We see the sights of New York.

People sympathize over Flagg's situation. She is in the show, then faints. Will raw eggs help? Can a world's expert on radium poisoning help Hazel? The children sing for Hazel Flagg! But a note suggests suicide. The police are called. Wallace Cook finds her on the pier. Will they marry? The experts find no symptoms in Hazel Flagg. A miracle cure or a publicity stunt? Will Hazel get sick? Publisher Oliver Stone says a newspaper needs integrity. But the legend becomes the fact because of special interests. So Hazel vanishes to fulfill expectations. ""The world will never forget Hazel Flagg.""

This comedy is still funny in spite of some dated humor. This satire on the newspaper business still has a lesson for its viewers.",1275436800,,1524,4.6162361623616235
326516,5,6301394747,"On reading some of the reviews of Nothing Sacred here, I saw that while some folks found it just fine & dandy, others were disappointed. Being Carole Lombard fans, and knowing the reputation of this film, they expected more from it; they expected it to be funnier than it was.

The problem is that this film was, as pointed out by others, more of a satire than a screwball comedy. In many ways, it was almost a late `30s film version of MAD magazine, and, thus, many of the barbs are aimed at topical targets that would be completely missed by the average film viewer 70 years later, unless he or she was, like I, a bug on 1930's pop culture.

For example, the opening scene, which some here have referred to as uncomfortably close to ""racist""; it features the black actor Troy Brown as a ""Oriental Potentate"" who is donating millions of dollars towards the establishment of a ""temple of learning & culture"". Rather than being an outrageous racial joke, it is a spoof on the then topical subject of Father Divine.

Shortly thereafter, the Fredric March character finds himself in Warsaw, Vermont, where he is mistreated and abused by sullen, silent, greedy, mossbacked Vermonters. While amusing in itself, it is more amusing when one realizes that this is Ben Hecht & director Wellman's acid take on Frank Capra's Mandrake Falls, from Mr. Deeds Goes To Town, where those same silent characters are portrayed as cute, cuddly, warm hearted but shrewd  eccentrics, and the homely, lovely little towns of New England are held up as paragons of all American virtues where the rube locals are actually infinitely smarter and wiser and more knowing than the slick city folks from New York. In this film those towns are places to flee from, places you wouldn't even want to die in. There is likely also a political jibe here. Hecht, a liberal, was likely thumbing his nose at one of the two states not to vote for Roosevelt in the 1936 election by portraying its citizens as nasty, hidebound and grasping.

The radium poisoning plot device was based on an actual incident, then current, where women who had worked in a watch factory as teenaged girls, painting the numbers on illuminated watch dials, started dying of cancer.

The scene in the nightclub, saluting the ""heroines of history"" features Frank Fay, then still a well known comedian. Fay more or less originated the role of ""MC"" in a vaudeville or revue setting. Fay's MC characterization was a smarmy, unctuous, egotistical wise guy who made belittling comments about the acts he introduced or ushered off the stage (you can see Fay's act in all its glory in the Warner Brother's early talkie revue ""Show of Shows""). Here he plays a caricature of that role, which made him a big star on Broadway. People in 1937 would have ""gotten"" this joke, but today people don't know Frank Fay and don't get the gag. This scene is also noteworthy as one of the earliest examples of a character flipping the bird in a Hollywood film, when the Dutch girl (played by Jinx Falkenburg, then America's most famous fashion model & cover girl) who saved her country by sticking her finger in the dike is told by Fay to ""show us the finger."" You can guess which finger it was.

There are dozens of examples of these topical jokes in this film, and I'll give one more. In the newspaper editor's office, Maxie Rosenbloom, playing his usual dim bulb character, is talking on the phone to his even dumber brother ""Moe"". He starts the conversation with ""Hello, Moe..."" I'm sure this joke, which would meet stony silence now, got screams in 1937, because it is a spoof of the famous ""Hello, Flo"" telephone scene from MGM's the Great Ziegfeld, the scene which won Luise Rainer the Academy Award for best actress in 1936.

To be fully appreciated, this film almost needs a booklet in which the then current pop culture references are explained. Still there is enough here to amuse even if one misses the topical jokes. But likely that's all this film will do--amuse. When one watches it now, knowing its reputation as one of the funniest comedies of the 30's, one should remember that that reputation comes from the original reaction to the film in 1937, when audiences would have gotten all the jokes.",1248912000,15,4225,4.7
326517,2,6301394747,The title says it all.  This would have been a much more enjoyable movie had the original that was used have been a good one.  At best I could only give the quality of the picture a C- or D+.,1242950400,5,191,3.75
326518,1,6301394747,"This is a great film, but do NOT buy the copy of the DVD with the airplane on the cover, it is TERRIBLE.  Fuzzy, poor sound quality, cheap graphics on the outside of the DVD case.  It looks like something tossed together by some company who makes bootleg copies from the t.v.  I've never heard of the company (Timeless Classics), and on top of everything else it arrived scratched and loose in the case.

326521,4,6301394747,"Nothing Sacred falls into the madcap comedy genre.  Carol Lombard is terrific as a woman who thought she was dying and then isn't.  The story illustrates some timeless truths -- namely that lies take on a life of their own.  The importance of the press dates the film -- the newspaper publisher is all-powerful, sort of a William Randolf Hearst character.  The movie raises some moral questions that are relevant today -- when the dying girl isn't going to die, people are actually disappointed.  One note that dates the film:  The portrayal of African-Americans is stereotypic for the era and may even be considered offensive.",1198800000,,627,4.923809523809524
326522,4,6301394747,"Nothing Sacred is considered a screwball comedy; but I'm afraid I have to differ to some degree. I thought the humor was lukewarm although the plot moves along at a good pace. The convincing acting held my attention and the choreography worked well in scenes involving crowds and hotel rooms.

When the movie begins, we meet Wally Cook (Fredric March), a newspaper reporter who has just cost his paper, The Morning Star, some embarrassment with a phony story. Although Wally gets a rotten demotion he soon convinces his boss Oliver Stone (Walter Connolly) that he has a sure-fire plan to get the biggest scoop in town. There's a lady in Vermont who is stricken with radium poisoning for which there is no cure and Wally wants to bring her to town (New York) and play it up for the newspaper to become hot stuff again.

Guess what? This stricken young lady, Hazel Flagg (Carole Lombard), is just about to learn that she's not ill--at all. Wally Cook comes to Vermont to escort her and her pal Dr. Enoch Downer (Charles Winninger) to New York, thinking all the while that she's dying and that the paper is getting an exclusive scoop on the story. Hazel wants to enjoy and have some fun--so she concocts a scheme of her own. Instead of telling Wally and the other New Yorkers that she's well, she lets them think she's dying as they throw lavish parties in her honor and give her the key to the city.

But not long after there's a major fly in the ointment. An Austrian radium poisoning expert, Dr. Emil Eggelhoffer (Sig Ruman), comes to New York with his associates--and he wants to see if he can help this poor dying girl--who's not really dying at all.

Of course, from here the plot can go nearly anywhere. Will Dr. Eggelhoffer find out the truth about Hazel not being ill? If so, what will he do--will he spread the word and ruin the newspaper's now phony scoop? What about Hazel and Wally--how will their relationship develop over time, especially if Wally learns the truth about Hazel being in perfectly good health?

I recommend this movie for fans of Carole Lombard, Fredric March and the director William Wellman. Look also for a brief but very good performance by Margaret Hamilton as the Vermont drugstore lady; Margaret played this role just two years before she played the wicked witch in The Wizard Of Oz. I must admit that the humor wasn't as good as I expected. Nevertheless, the film has its good moments and great cinematography; and the dialogue works while the plot develops nicely.

Four stars.",1198368000,,2513,4.648648648648648
326523,5,6301394747,"This is a screwball comedy about a young woman named Hazel Flagg (Carole Lombard) from a small town of Warsaw, Vermont is supposedly dying of radium poisoning.  Wally Cook (Fredric March), a New York newspaper reporter writes a series of stories about her; the readers learn about Hazel and they get caught up with this story. Emotions run high, sympathy flows, and soon Hazel becomes the toast of New York.

When a team of doctors examine Hazel, the truth comes out; she is not dying, the situation becomes a farce, and may cost Wally his job; by this time Hazel is in love with Wally. Therefore instead of hurting his career, she decides to fake her suicide by drowning during a cruise trip. Wally rush to save her but only to be saved by Hazel, because he can't swim. There are some fine moments in the movie, my favorites are; the fight scene between Wally and Hazel when he tries to give her symptoms of pneumonia to cover up his misreporting. The entire scene is completely offbeat, and hilarious. Secondly, when Hazel in a fireman's hat rescues Wally in the drowning scene; disaster turns into laughter. Carole Lombard offers outstanding performance as an innocent small town girl caught between love and pride; small town and big city. She is not only beautiful but adorable as a helpless girl from a rural town.

Max Rosenbloom, a well known boxer at that time has a cameo role and gives Hazel boxing lessons to prepare her for her fight scene with Wally. Ben Hecht adapted this story from a letter published in Hearst's International-Cosmopolitan by James Street, and the movie was produced by David Selznick.

326527,4,6301394747,"""Nothing Sacred"" is something of a letdown because it doesn't deliver on it's promising premise.  For sure there are any number of chuckles here but nothing that really aches the funnybone.  The comedy is played too broadly to have any real resonance.  It doesn't really work as a satire on yellow journalism for that same reason.  The revelation here is the work of Carol Lombard who plays a smalltown girl who fakes radiation poisoning to parlay it into fame and fortune in the Big Apple.  Lombard is a deft comedian who effortlessly straddles the lighter and broader comedic elements of her character and loses none of her glamour in the process.  Frederic March, however, is something of a stiff here appearing to sleepwalk his way through his role as Lombard's benefactor from the New York tabloid.",1149638400,,803,4.867647058823529
326528,4,6301394747,"Carole Lombard is adorable as the supposedly terminally ill girl from a small town in Vermont, and Fredric March is outstanding as the street smart newspaper reporter who ""rescues"" her from her mundane existence in a clannish little Vermont town. I especially enjoyed the more quirky scenes, such as Fredric March being bitten in the leg by the growling little boy who materializes from behind a gate. The color and sound are somewhat old and faded but the story and acting are excellent. I would recommend this to fans of classic movies.",1141430400,,538,4.858695652173913
326529,4,6301394747,"The incandescent Carole Lombard was simply the most beautiful comedienne during Hollywood's golden era of the 1930's. In fact, the one conceit of the film is how her stunning glamour, especially in the newspaper photos, seems at odds with the innocent small-town girl she portrays in this 1937 screwball comedy classic directed in lickety-split fashion by the two-fisted William ""Wild Bill"" Wellman. Lombard never let her beauty get in the way of being funny, and her effervescent manner makes her seem dotty enough to make the crazy situations she gets into believable. Moreover, the film's constant tweaking at the public obsession over a young woman's impending death predates the concept of reality programming by nearly 70 years.

For a movie that clocks in at just 75 minutes, the far-fetched story is fairly dense but clips by without a wasted moment. In brief, Wally Cook is a New York tabloid reporter relegated to the obituaries after his most recent story is exposed as fake. Seeking to rehabilitate his career, he uncovers a story on Hazel Flagg, a woman in rural Vermont dying of radium poisoning. When he arrives in her town, she suddenly learns that her diagnosis was a mistake and that she is not dying at all. However, feeling constrained by her small town existence, Hazel pretends to be terminally ill in order to accept Wally's offer to take her to New York City. In true 1930's fashion, New York pours its heart out to her making her an instant media celebrity. Hazel starts to feel guilty over the misdirected attention, and of course, Wally and Hazel find themselves falling in love amid all the deception and inevitable chaos.

Just coming off his classic dramatic turn in the most cohesive version of ""A Star Is Born"", stalwart leading actor Fredric March gamely plays the initially cynical Wally with the right everyman demeanor, though I kept thinking how much more at home William Powell or Cary Grant would have been in the role. The lovable Lombard makes Hazel a sublime comic creation even though the character is basically a selfish charlatan. They have a classic sparring scene near the end where each lands a punch on the jaw of the other. Familiar character actors complete the cast with Walter Connolly in constipated frustration as Wally's constantly boiling editor-in-chief (aptly named Oliver Stone), Charles Winninger properly pixilated as Hazel's fraud of a doctor, and familiar faces like Sig Ruman, Margaret Hamilton, Hattie McDaniel and Hedda Hopper in little more than walk-on parts.

Wellman displays an idiosyncratic way with the camera, for instance, focusing on Lombard's ankles as she flirts with March in an open crate or having a tree branch cover their faces during a key dialogue scene. Unsurprisingly, the director of ""Wings"" and ""Lafayette Escadrille"" inserted a scene aboard a plane to show off the Manhattan skyline. One of the first movies filmed in Technicolor, it still looks pretty good though there is subtle graininess and typical for a film of this age, a constant popping noise exists in the background. Not as good as ""My Man Godfrey"" nor as funny as ""Bringing Up Baby"", ""Nothing Sacred"" is still great entertainment and a rare opportunity to see the luminous Lombard at full star wattage.",1131667200,4,3256,4.9926335174953955
326530,2,6301394747,"I won't add to the many words said about this wonderful film. This is just to comment briefly on the picture quality of the GoodTimes release of the movie. The rating is simply for the DVD, not the film.

For a public domain title, sharpness is a little better than expected. I was pleased to see a some film grain over the Selznick logo. Contrast is pretty good, if a little thick - however, blacks are black and whites white. Colour, as expected, is the weakest hand - there's little sense of the glow that early 3-strip Technicolor possessed. But it is not dreadful.

Although I have not seen it, by reputation the Image DVD release is the best for colour.

326531,5,6301394747,"This film classic takes cynicism to new heights in fun fashion as Carole Lombard gives a truly wonderful performance as a girl from a small town in Vermont who becomes the toast of New York thanks to jaded reporter Fredric March, and a bad medical diagnosis from her pal Charles Winninger. David O. Selznick produced and William A. Wellman directed what is not only a screen classic, but one of the finest moments in Carole Lombard's career.

Ben Hecht wrote the screenplay from a story by James H. Street and it is both a funny and cynical take on the newspaper business and the American public. Oscar Levant wrote the score and Raymond Scott and his Quintett add some swing music. Fredric March and Carole Lombard have a chemistry that makes this one a lot of fun.

Fredrick March is Wally Cook, a star reporter for the ""New York Morning Star"" who is demoted to the obituary page when his paper is taken for a free ride by a man passing himself off as a Sultan. When he turns out to be only a bootblack, Cook feels the heat from his boss, Oliver Stone (Walter Connolly). Connolly is fine as the editor with egg on his face. Stone has a heart, but only if you're willing to blast for it!

Wally sees a chance to get back in Oliver's good graces when he spots a short story about a young girl from the small town of Warsaw, Vermont, who has been diagnosed with radium poisoning and has only a short time to live. He heads for Warsaw to bring back, and exploit, Hazel Flagg, cut down in her prime.

Carole Lombard, of course, is Hazel Flagg. The reason Hazel is crying isn't because she's dying, but rather because Dr. Enoch Downer (Charles Winninger) has just told Hazel he made a mistake and she's going to have to remain in Warsaw after all. Hazel was going to use the 200 dollars you get from dying in Warsaw to see the world, and get out of the small town. Winninger is a hoot as the doctor who drinks his poison out of a black jug and is still upset with not winning an essay contest in Wally's paper.

When Wally shows up and wants to take Hazel back to New York, she sees her chance to get out, and talks her friend Enoch into going with her under the ruse that she really is dying. As she tells Enoch: ""It's startling to be brought to life twice, and each time in Warsaw!"" Once they travel by plane to New York, which is a new experience for both Hazel and Enoch, the real fun begins.

Lombard is sweet and adorable as Hazel lives it up as though she were really dying and in the process, thanks to a series of stories by Wally, becomes the toast of New York. Wally begins to feel bad, however, and finds himself falling for Hazel. There is a romantic scene as they go sailing and Lombard is lovely here. Hazel is beginning to fall for Wally as well, and is starting to feel bad about the charade.

Lombard is hilarious as she gets plastered at a casino and passes out before the devoted crowd. The cynicism of Ben Hecht's script really shines as Oliver, standing over Hazel, inquires from Wally about her condition: ""Don't spare my feelings. We go to press in 15 minutes."" There are many such moments contrasted against the sweetness of Hazel Flagg.

Once a team of real doctors are brought in to examine Hazel, the gig is up. Hazel loves Wally and decides to fake her suicide with Enoch's help in order to save his career. Wally doesn't care that it was all fake, however, and in a rush to save her, ends up knocking her in the river where he almost drowns himself, because he can't swim. Lombard in a fireman's hat and wet clothes will leave no doubt that she was one of the screen's most beautiful actresses, as well as one of its finest comedians.

There is a hilarious fight scene between Wally and Hazel as he tries to give her symptoms of pnemonia that has a romantic glow despite the cynicism involved. The only way to make things work for both Hazel and the paper, however, is for her to go away alone to die. Wally may have to leave also if he wants to join her on the cruise to ""death"" she's taking with Enoch.

This was a film originally in early technicolor. Prints vary as to color quality, the Kino version being the best I've seen. All are watchable, however, and this film is just as wonderful, perhaps even more so, if you turn off the color and simply watch it in glorious black and white. Lombard would give her life for her country on an Indiana war bond tour and this film is a shining example of the magic she left behind. You do not want to miss it.",1128211200,8,4482,4.306049822064057
326532,5,6301394747,"Carol Lombard's comic genius truly makes this picture a winner. It was probably all filmed in Hollywood, save for the airplane exterior sequences over the real NYC, but it comes off enough like the Big Apple to seem authentic.",1115078400,,226,4.82051282051282

It was written by master Hollywood script writer Ben Hecht, so the dialogue fairly crackles, but the movie doesn't hold up too well after a few viewings.

Lombard shines in early technicolor comedy about young woman from small town of Warsaw, Vermont who is diagnosed with fatal radium poisoning by lush, Winninger.  Meanwhile ""New York Morning Star"" reporter March, who has been relegated to editing the paper's obituaries after leading the paper into an embarassing scandal, hits upon the idea of bringing Lombard to New York city and reporting on her final days in order to increase paper sales and get back into the good graces of his boss, Connolly.
Unbeknownst to March, Lombard has been misdiagnosed and is in no danger of an imminent death.  However, she is yearning to get away from Warsaw and see New York city, therefore when approached by March she accepts his invitation without letting him in on the fact that she is no longer ""sick"".  She also insists that Winninger be allowed to accompany her.  The doctor accepts (he has held a long grudge against March's paper and sees  an opportunity to get bach at the publication) and together the trio fly to the Big Apple where Lombard is wined and dined to the delight of a sickenly aroused public.
Eventually March falls for Lombard, who struggles with her concience to tell the truth about her health.
This movie is a Selznick production which was helmed by Wellman, who was best known for his war films.  The quality of the DVD transfer that I viewed (from Alpha Video) was good.  The color was somewhat faded in parts, but overall it was very watchable (alas there are no extras).  This movie has been called one of the greatest ""screwball"" comedies.  I thought it was more of a ""black"" comedy than screwball.  There were some funny moments (March being attacked by the little boy being the highlight), but overall most of the comedy was cynical, and thus more restrained.  There is little comparison between this film and Lombard's screwball gem ""Twentieth Century"", but this is still an entertaining movie.  It is very politically incorrect by today's standards and thus has a slightly dated feel to it.  The roles of the African Americans in the movie (including a cameo appearance by Hattie McDaniel) are particularly dated, as is the bedroom ""fight"" scene between Lombard and March.
The pluses to this film are the strong supporting cast (including Margaret Hamilton as a drug store owner) and the New York locales, especially the contemporary aerial views of the  skyline as the trio fly into the city.  The caricatures of the cast during the opening credits are also a neat touch.  This good priced DVD is definitely worth a look by those who enjoy movies from this era, as well as those who wish to see Lombard in her prime before her untimely death in a 1942 plane crash during a war bond tour.",1101600000,4,2949,4.819085487077535
326535,5,6301394747,"First of all: the five stars are for the movie, because the DVD P.D. (Public Domain) transfer is pretty bad, with washed-out colors (this one was one of the few technicolor movies made in the '30s), so it hardly deserves 2 stars on that account. Anyway it was great to have the chance of watching two of my fave stars: Carole Lombard and Fredric March.

Here they're in peak form, and team up very well together, as a reporter (March) who falls for this small-town girl (Lombard) who's supposedly goin to die of radium poisoning, then taking her to New York, where she becomes the ""toast"" of the city.

Grand performances by Walter Connolly as March's Editor and Charlie Winninger as the small-town doctor who diagnosed the disease. Deft direction from William Wellman.

Great fun!!

326536,4,6301394747,"Jason Blair, eat your heart out!  Frederick March stars as an unscrupulous newspaper reporter who uses a maudlin tragedy -- a young woman who's dying of radium poisoning -- as a way to revive his shaky career.  The trouble is, the gal is actually faking her ailment, using it as a way to escape her dull life in a provincial Vermont village.  Carole Lombard plays the faker, Ms. Hazel Flagg, who becomes the toast of the town when brought to see the bright lights of New York City.  Ben Hecht's tart, cynical script skillfully juxtoposes the sensationalized sentimentalism that Hazel attracts with the business-as-usual media hype and casual crassness of the Big Apple. While the film has its weak points (poor sound design, rushed production values, some ethnic humor that hasn't aged well), Hecht's merciless portrayal of flavor-of-the-week media ""events"" proves once again that the more things change, the more they stay the same. Recommended.

326537,4,6301394747,"This is one of the 15 all-time greatest screwball comedies of the 1930's...and the only one that was in Technicolor.  Problem is that Selnick sold the rights to it (it's in the public domain) sometime in the 1940's and it's very hard to find a decent of print of this (despite the fact that The Museum Of Modern Art completely resotred the movie to it's original Technicolor splendor...but they stupidly won't release it on VHS or DVD to the public...)  Carole Lombard, Fredric March, Walter Connolly, and Charles Winninger have never been better.  Absolutely first rate film directed by William Wellman and screenplay by Ben Hecht.  Worth buying, despite the medicore quality (and occasional blurriness).",1035590400,11,705,5.104347826086957
326538,5,6301394747,The plot for Nothing Sacred was standard comedy plot #2 done dozens of times in different movies. It was the talent and genius of Carole Lombard that makes this movie a comedy classic.,1015545600,3,184,4.606060606060606
326539,4,6301394747,"Much like Marilyn Monroe, Carole Lombard continues to intrigue even decades after her own untimely death.  An actress skilled at drama but showing a distinct preference for comedy, Lombard mixed her stunning beauty with a genuinely quick wit and a sharp, sarcastic intelligence.  On screen, she was someone who, even at her most vulenerable, could still obviously take care of herself.  Whereas the joy from watching Katharine Hepburn's screwball comedies came from seeing the haughty Hepburn brought down a notch or two, the joy of Lombard's films was watching her force the rest of the world to come up a few notches to meet her.
One of her most enduring (and endearing) turns came in the 1936 film Nothing Sacred.  In a plot recycled in countless films since, Lombard is mistakenly told that she is dying.  A small-town girl, Lombard's one wish is to see New York before she dies.  Natrually, New York's high society welcomes her with open arms and Lombard, on account of her impending death, becomes the toast of the town.  Of course, this is when Lombard finds out that she's not dying.  This is where Nothing Sacred differs from nearly every other film ripped off from it since.  Instead of humbly admitting the truth, once-innocent Lombard carries on the charade because she's grown to love the attention!  Whereas in today's Hollywood, nervous studio execs would wonder if this made Lombard an unlikeable character for middle America, the classic screwball comedies of the '30s had the guts to simply go with their outrageous situations.  Instead of simply going out of their way to conform to presumed audience expectations, filmmakers like Howard Hawks and William A. Wellman (who directed this film in a nicely breezy style) understood that if they simply went to the trouble to 1) find a good script and 2) cast talented performers like Lombard, audiences would be willing to follow their films wherever they led.  To be honest, I suspect audiences haven't changed but unfortunately, filmmaking has.  The screwball comedy is a genre that modern Hollywood tries to recreate every couple of years.  Usually, they fail.  Luckily, we have films like Nothing Sacred, My Man Godfrey, 20th Century, and others to remind us of how wonderful these films (and their stars) truly were.",1006214400,42,2286,4.994722955145119
326540,5,6301394747,"Carole Lombard was an intelligent beautiful natural blonde, the greatest female Screwball comedian , highest paid actress, wife of Clark Gable and one of the most powerful woman in Hollywood during the 1930's until her untimely death in 1942. This beautifully restored DVD gives us a taste of Carole Lombard and the effect she had to audiences of the 30's.  This was her only Technicolor movie she ever made.  So sit back and watch her natural beauty and acting genius evolve on the screen.  Fredric March as her co-star adds to this adorably humorous film.
In Summary: A Vermont girl Hazel Flagg (Lombard) in diagnosed in having radium poisoning (terminal). A hot shot New York Jounalist (March)reads about this in a newspaper and wants to use this event to raise his magazines popularity by sponsoring Hazel. Bringing her to New York City and presenting her with the ""Keys to the City"" and VIP status raises great public awareness.  All the time using public sympathy to raise magazine sales.
Hazel finds out she was mis-diagnosed and reluctantly continues on with the scam.  In the meantime March starts falling in love with Hazel and he wants her to rest and be comfortable until her end comes.  As you can see this has a strange twist of events which is the main ingredient to the ""SCREWBALL COMEDIES"" of the 30's.  Proving ""Nothing's Sacred""!!!
The extras include: 2 early silent Lombard movies and Gable & Lombard home movies.  This is a collectable ""LIMITED EDITION"" DVD to have.",1004054400,12,1487,4.849802371541502
326541,5,6301394747,"NOTHING SACRED has all the right elements to make it a classic screwball comedy.  It's short (a mere 74 minutes), has tight and fast scenes, some out-of-the-blue and very odd occurences (as mentioned by others, the boy biting March is a riot), stars who aren't afraid to get silly or messy to produce the best laugh, and a strong, scathing message.
Ben Hecht's script is excellent, providing many belly laughs during the movie, and chuckles long after the VCR or DVD player has been shut off.  Carole Lombard is her hilarious wacky self.  I love black and white movies, but I must admit the Technicolor really allowed me to appreciate her full beauty.  And as for Fredric March, well, I've always had a sweet spot for his acting, and he certainly didn't disappoint in this production.  He and Lombard balance each other out perfectly.  And, as was characteristic of the great comedies of the 30s, the supporting characters excel in their roles to round out a practically perfect comedy.
As far as the film itself, there were three aspects that I particularly enjoyed.  One being the sincere, in your face view of male/female relationships.  The bedroom fighting scene between March and Lombard is hilarious, one of the highlights of the movie, but would never make it on screen in any of today's movies.  In today's movie world where you can't offend ANYONE (except Christians or Republicans), and you usually can't show any kind of physical humor toward women (yet it's OK to beat the guy to a pulp), the un-PC nature of this 60+ year old production gives it unexpected freshness.
A second uncommon point is the change in the romantic comedy formula.  You know, it almost always goes boy meets girl, boy and girl are together for awhile having a jim-dandy time, boy and girl break up after tiff or misunderstanding of some sort, boy or girl makes a witty, cutesy speech to get them back together.  This movie changes at least the last part of that formula to focus the last question from ""How will they get back together?"" to ""How will they get out of the problem together?"".  Nice little twist.
A final interesting aspect was the deliberate hiding of Lombard and March's faces during most of their more intimate scenes.  This is fitting considering the movie was a rail against the mass media's need to sensationalize and exploit every intimate thing (and the masses' willingness to happily join in the explotation).
If you enjoyed BRINGING UP BABY or IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT, you're bound to enjoy this film.  If you enjoy this film, but haven't seen the other two I mentioned, check them out!  Chances are you won't be disappointed!",988934400,30,2634,4.770925110132159

7811229,3,6301394747,"No question the laugh-hungry 1930s Great Depression audiences were entertained by films which represented the golden age of classic screw-ball comedies from the likes of directors Preston Sturgis, Frank Capra and William Wellman the director of the film under review Nothing Sacred, done in early Technicolor (the first such screwball comedy). No question as well that the subject of the media and its foibles, excesses and dishonesties, then and now, are a fit subject for screwball comedy in any age (although one has to go some to be Cary Grants The Front Page from that same period). And no question no screw-ball comedy is worth a damn if there isn't a little romance thrown in to insure a happy ending for those laugh-hungry Great Depression audiences. That my friends is the trifecta.

Heres the scoop. Wally Cook (played here rather stiffly by Fredric March who usually played characters with a certain gravitas) a from hunger no-hold-barred field reporter for any newspaper USA in any town USA (although the actual setting in the film is New York City) got burned, got burned badly trying to stage a society charity hoax to run a story to the ground and make a name for himself in the big city. As a result he was relegated to the obits, literally the kiss-of-death for any hot-shot reporter on the make. By hook or by crook he inveigled the big boss to let him run with a story about a woman in Vermont, Hazel Flagg, (played by Carol Lombard also somewhat stiffly since she was known as a comedy star of sorts) who was allegedly dying of incurable radium poisoning (yeah this is before the atom bomb and all that). Wally swears he will have them (those city fervent newspaper readers) crying for more once he sets the story up, and jump the newspapers circulation up to boot. The boss buys into that proposition and Wally is on his way to the sticks.

Things as they always do in screw-ball comedies, get tricky, get complicated once he gets to Podunk though. See Hazel has been misdiagnosed by her, well, stew-ball doctor and she is not dying. Thus she will miss that trip to New York City with all the trimming that she had dreamed about as a farewell to this world (NYC then, and now too although perhaps less so, a Mecca for those who have not been there before, especially small-town types). No problem though as Hazel decided to play sick and take Wally up on that trip offer. And off they go.
Well New York City and its attentions to her are everything she expected, and more. But then things got sticky again. She fell for Wally, fell hard and didn't know how to tell him she was not going to die. He has fallen for her too so that got things all mixed up until she hit on the bright idea of committing suicide, of fading from view before every New Yorker who could read found out she was a hoax. Eventually Wally found out about her real state, found out he has no problem with her suicide solution and they go off into the sunset to marital bliss. Sure the plot line had been done before, and since, but here it is all wrapped up in bows for you, wrapped up in good feelings if you were in that Great Depression audience needing a little escape from your own woes.",1434326400,,3184,4.506920415224913
