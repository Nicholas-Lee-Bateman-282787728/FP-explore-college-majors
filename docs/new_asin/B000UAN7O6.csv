8212762,4,B000UAN7O6,"DIGIVIEW's slimline cased DVDs are dubbed from unrestored ""best available source"" films. Condition varies from very good to only fair. Audio levels are however some of the highest you'll find, which makes these ideal for laptop PC or portable disc player watching.

The eight PD cartoons listed on the back of DIGIVIEW'S ROCKY & BULLWINKLE VOL. 1 are not part of this collection's content.

What you DO get is three intact half-hour Bullwinkle shows, consisting of the first six episodes of the ""Buried Treasure"" serial, plus all other cartoons and bumpers that were sandwiched in-between these bookending chapters.
