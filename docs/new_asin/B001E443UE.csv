8296257,1,B001E443UE,This is a terrible depiction of the band.  They have no affiliation with the group involved and is very amateur.  Don't waste your money!,1257379200,2,137,4.666666666666667
8296258,2,B001E443UE,"It is a good TV program and misleading DVD as some rehearsals of popular tunes provided instead full length songs advertised on a jacket.

A doco is of interest to deep funs and interested in rock history mostly.",1249862400,5,212,4.578947368421052
8296259,1,B001E443UE,"This is complete rip off.  Metallica nor their music are present in this DVD.  Just a bunch of fat, old, rockers talking about Metallica.",1238630400,5,137,4.666666666666667
