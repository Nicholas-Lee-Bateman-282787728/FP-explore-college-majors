880186,5,6304457278,"This is absolutely one of the best of the best.  John Wayne plays Wil Anderson, a rancher forced to use young boys to get his herd to market when his men desert him in search of gold.  There are many wonderful messages in  this film about duty, honor, and responsibility.  They are messages our  nation and our young people are in great need of right now.  This movie  contains many memorable and haunting scenes, but none more so then when  Wayne is forced into a confrontation with Bruce Dern to protect the young  boys he has on the cattle drive. He gives his life, and teaches them the  meaning of strength, honor, and courage.  I could not disagree more with  Leonard Maltin's review - the message is not to seek violent revenge; the  boys simply ""finish the job"" they were hired to do and take the  money from the sale of the herd back to Wil Anderson's wife.  This film  captures the greatness of Wayne's legacy, and why he is so adored by  millions of Americans who hold duty and courage dear.  If I had to  recommend only one John Wayne film to someone who had never seen one, this  would be it.  Truly unforgettable!",927331200,70,1126,4.3951219512195125

I watched it AGAIN with my grandsons ages 9 and 11 who loved it too and now are John Wayne fans forty years after his death. They were jumping in their seats. Reminded me of Saturday Matinees at the Movies when I was their age, cheering on the very same hero! An Immortal for the Ages.

881297,5,6304457278,"Released in 1972 and directed by Mark Rydell, The Cowboys stars John Wayne as an aging rancher who is forced to hire pubescent drovers for a 400-mile cattle drive from Bozeman, Montana, to Belle Fourche, South Dakota, after his ranch hands abandon him for a gold rush. Roscoe Lee Browne plays the wise black cook while Slim Pickens & Colleen Dewhurst have small roles.

This is a realistic, almost epic Wayne Western focusing on the long cattle drive and the amateur boys learning to be men. It lacks the fun brawling and unrealistic elements of Johns contemporary Westerns of the 60s-70s (e.g. the quick-draw nonsense in El Dorado). A Martinez stands out as the outcast Hispanic amongst the kids while Bruce Dern is notable as a menacing ne'er-do-well. The almost shocking confrontation that opens the final act is a highlight and the boys just strategy is great: KILL EM ALL.

The film runs 134 minutes and was shot in Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona and Warner Brothers Burbank Studios, California. The screenplay was based on William Dale Jenningss novel.

881301,5,6304457278,"One of my favorite John Wayne movies. Contrary to what folks say, (spoiler) John Wayne did die in several of his films and this is one lf them. However, it's near the end of the film and essential for the plot. Bruce Dern says he got a lot of hail mail after this film and if you watch you'll know why.
I've got this on Blu-ray and dvd and, unlike many of my films where the Blu-ray is incredibly better then the dvd, with this film I find the quality just a little bit better on the Blu-ray. Maybe my eyes don't see the difference, but if you own the dvd, I would not recommend upgrading - one of the few times I can say this with my movie collection.
Anyway, a great movie, a great cast and a wonderful plot - the boys are mostly amateurs but amazing actors and great horsemen - this may be why I enjoy it so much.
A bit of language (minor) and a lot of violence (evident, but not a lot of blood and gore) but still one of my favorites. If True Grit is a 10, this is an 8. Enjoy!",1493769600,,981,3.9346733668341707

881463,5,6304457278,"John Wayne's best movie. John Wayne pulls off the best performance of his life because he's not acting, he is just himself. He stepped out of his stereotypical role and plays an old rancher who just needs to get his cattle to Belle Fourche. In many of Wayne's films he is acting a little too much, but in this role he is very comfortable in his own skin. He is more of the grandfather figure in this movie. He isn't patronizing to the boys, but loves them and treats them like men. His failure as a father to his deceased sons is not overplayed, but merely alluded to. He is not trying to redeem himself to be a father figure to his cow-boys, but he ends up gaining their respect and love. The dialogue between Wayne's character and Roscoe Lee Brown is seamless. Dern is good, but his role in this movie is usually overhyped. It's Wayne's subtlety and underacting which is at the heart of this movie. He should have received the Oscar for this role because it's where he acts the least. There aren't any wide-eyed moments or grandiose brawls, or fawning side-kicks. It's just Wayne being perfectly comfortable in his own skin.",1489017600,,1126,4.4975609756097565

And come back as seasoned cowboys.  Bruce Dern as the head baddie gets the most out of his role.  Nobody made westerns quite like John Wayne.  Again I don't think mthis is one of his best.

Roscoe Lee Browne made me smile... ""I regret trifling with married women. I'm thoroughly ashamed at cheating at cards. I deplore my occasional departures from the truth. Forgive me for taking your name in vain, my Saturday drunkenness, my Sunday sloth. Above all, forgive me for the men I've killed in anger [eyes shifting to Bruce Dern] and those I am about to."" And of course The Duke [to Bruce Dern]... ""I'm thirty years older than you are. I had my back broke once, and my hip twice.

Most John Wayne movies, especially his older ones are great, family friendly movies. I really thought about putting this movie in the burn barrel. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain! One of Wayne's other movies to boycott is the one that Opie played in. Horrible profanity in that one too. I boycott all of Opie's movies. He's a wicked person. I loved watching him as a young respectful boy on the Andy Griffith Show. I pray he'll repent and accept the Lord before it's too late!",1471564800,,604,4.601851851851852
882069,5,6304457278,"I'm not sure where to start with the wonders of this. To begin, it's the best movie John Wayne ever made, without any competition. For once, late in his career, Wayne stepped away from Batjac, stepped away from the usual crowd of extras like Hank Worden, stepped away from the mega-costar model (Dean Martin, Robert Mitchum, etc.) and stepped away from the tried and true stable of Western directors and producers. The result is the perfect John Wayne film. Sure, Wayne got his Oscar for True Grit, but pretty much everybody knows he got that because the Academy didn't think he'd be around the next year. He should have gotten an Oscar for this one.

The cinematography is breathtaking in its richness and scope. The music (John Williams) is exceptional. The rapport between Wil Andersen (Wayne) and Anse Peterson (Slim Pickens) is priceless. Later, the relationship between Andersen and Jebediah Nightlinger (Roscoe Lee Browne) grows to importance. And finally, what goes between Andersen and the cowboys themselves, the oldest being fifteen, is really the stuff Wayne's legend is made of. Especially later in his career, Wayne always played some sort of father figure, a protector, a lawman, a knight. This is Wayne at his purest and finest.

If you're a Wayne fan, and you'd like to step off the Rio Lobo/Rio Grande/El Dorado merry-go-round, here's where to step. Prepare for the ride of your life.",1470787200,18,1402,4.961702127659574

882169,5,6304457278,"Hitting the theaters during the Vietnam War, 1972, it is a movie which ends with much violence, although tame by todays standards.  Therefore  it is not surprising then that many reviewers reacted negatively to this movie.  Yet it is a criticism that is not well deserved for it portrays what many young Americans were called upon to do at that time    become men under demanding circumstances.

John Wayne, an aging rancher, recruits a group of school boys -- not unlike many of the young men in America who were being ""recruited"" into the army  to help him with a cattle drive of about 400 miles.  The boys range from about 12-15.  On the trail, many find themselves called upon to do things that they never would have imagined weeks before and are introduced in to the mysterious and demanding  world of adulthood ( leaving home, hard work, the temptations of the flesh, and ultimately justice and doing ones duty).

John Wayne is at his finest and is joined by a very talented cast: Roscoe Lee Browne, Coleen Dewhurst, and Bruce Dern - who is in his best Dern crazy mode, as the leader of the outlaw rustlers.

The photography, especially on Blu Ray is spectacular on a widescreen, and the score by John Williams is rousing and one of his best.

It is right up there with the best of John Wayne's hits.",1468540800,,1306,4.549356223175966

his hands go in search of their fortune.
'Will' needs to make ,the drive this year or go into debt an option he can't contemplate...
A friend and local storekeeper suggests he employs schoolboys, the boys of course are keen to take up the challenge though
'Will' has grave misgivings.....he challenges them to prove themselves by staying on a untamed horse for the count of ten,
the boys that complete the test surprise him, however they are interrupted by a very confident gun-totting boy by the name
of 'Cimarron' (A Martinez) who wants to join the drive and proves more than capable on the untrained horse, though 'Will'
soon see's him as a troublemaker who he's reluctant to hire.
Ahead of them 400 miles of tough terrain....'Will' doesn't expect to complete the drive with the young greenhorns alongside
him.
The Cowboys -
'Fat's' (Alfred Barker jr)
'Dan' (Nicolas Beauvy)
'Steve' (Steve Benedict)
'Slim Honeycutt' (Robert Carradine)
'Weedy' (Norman Howell)
'Charlie Schwartz' (Stephen R. Hudis)
'Stuttering Bob' (Sean Kelly)
'Hardy Fimps' (Clay O'Brian)
'Jimmy Phillips' (Sam O'Brian)
'Homer Weems' (Mike Pyeatt)
They are joined by Cook 'Jebediah Nightlinger' (Roscoe Lee Browne) and after a short distance 'Cimarron' who had been following
the drive early-on, his ability with the gun he carries will come in handy.
The drive will be a hard learning curb for many of the young Cow''boys'' but they will learn.
When the drive runs into trouble in the shape of a gang of ex-cons led by 'Long Hair' (Bruce Dern) when the boys become men.

This perhaps one of my favourite 'John Wayne' westerns....it tells quite a story.
Good Blu-ray upgrade.

My grandfather's stories (and my grandmother's) bear that out. There is comic relief, bravado and plenty of tension building to the climax.

884809,5,6304457278,"This a one of my favorite John Wayne movies; even though it is not without flaws.

In my view, a few major themes permeate the film:

1. The story of redemption: that we seem to learn that John Wayne's character (Wil Andersen) failed as a father, and now has a chance to do it the right way as he takes some adolescent boys on a cattle drive. Indeed, for all his toughness, Wayne is actually portraying a character who is really quite vulnerable. This is most evident as he is seen visiting the grave site of his two sons who ""went bad"". To what extent, fiction portrays reality; we don't know; but I have a feeling that underneath Wayne's tough exterior, he was, after all, a human being like the rest of us. Those who accused Wayne of not being able to act, should re-examine not just ""The Cowboys"", but several other Wayne films including ""True Grit"", which demonstrate that Wayne played complex characters who often were quite vulnerable beneath their rough exteriors.

2. It's a story of friendship between John Wayne's character (Wil Andersen)and his black cook, Jedediah Nightlinger (portrayed by the sophisticated and dignified, Roscoe Lee Browne). This is perhaps the only John Wayne movie I can think of where ""The Duke"" co-stars with an African American, and given his controversial remarks concerning Blacks and other minorities in his real life, this movie seems to exemplify the complex interplay between White and Black Americans that existed within Wayne's generation. Indeed, as Wil Andersen (John Wayne) first encounters Jedediah Nightlinger(Roscoe Lee Browne), he is visibly apprehensive, and perhaps a little disparaging of having to work with a Black man. However, as the two men come to respect one another in a working relationship; they also become friends; almost as co-parents to the boys. In one episode concerning Andersen's heavy-handed treatment of a boy who is afraid of the dark, Nightlinger (Browne) actually takes Andersenn (Wayne) to task.

3. I can't but help see ""The Cowboys"" as a story that concerns the death of John Wayne. Along this line, rarely, does John Wayne's character die in his 200+ movies. In ""The Cowboys"" Wayne is not only killed but he is killed in brutal fashion by a perfectly evil and psychopathic villain called ""Long Hair"" (Played by Bruce Dern). In my view, ""Long Hair"" may represent the counter-culture that was prevalent during the time that this movie was made; that the counter-culture wanted to kill, not so much John Wayne, but what they thought he represented.

As the ""The Cowboys"" explored these themes with fine directing, acting, obvious chemistry between actors, gripping drama and a fair amount of humor; some flaws are apparent.

First of all, one must lend oneself to a very flexible suspension of reality; that a bunch of adolescent boys on a cattle drive would have even been possible; let alone the way that they are able to beat the ruthless and far more experienced ""bad guys"" at the end of the movie.

In this regard, the ending has a feeling of being tacked-on. The ending of the movie seems to come with the death of John Wayne, that he sought redemption and very nearly got it before he was done in by the bad guys; but, alas, this is Hollywood, and such an ending won't do. Therefore, we are carried away through the sequence where Nightlinger and the boys avenge Wil Andersen (and John Wayne) and get the bad guys.

The final scene, however, is quite poignant, where the boys buy a marker for Wil Andersen; and have it inscribed ""Beloved Husband and Father""; and this is the point of the film, that it's not about revenge, but redemption.",1377993600,,3624,4.815112540192926

884811,5,6304457278,"It is violent. It is tragic. The bad guys are pretty bad. No part of these aspects seems misplaced or overdone. Lots of good moments--humor, kindness, honor, and loyalty are all characteristics strongly portrayed. There is sacrifice and JW actually gives the ultimate sacrifice--his life--for the boys sake. Lots of esprit de corp. Overall great family movie for those who don't shirk from death and/or the existence of evil in the world.",1376870400,,438,5.097222222222222

884837,5,6304457278,One of his best. The only one I like better is Big Jake. Can't beat the Duke in western movies.,1374969600,,95,3.8
884838,5,6304457278,"Intended as a major roadshow picture, The Cowboys suffered badly on its original release in 1972 as a hostile press tried to read Wayne's offscreen political views into what was basically an exceptionally good cattle drive Western with a twist. With the twist being that a gold rush causes all Wayne's farm hands to skip the ranch, forcing him to recruit a motley group of schoolboys to take their place. A rites of passage tale, many chose to interpret their ultimately violent coming of age as a right-wing statement on everything from gun ownership to the Vietnam war, but removed from the political fallout of its day it holds up remarkably well as a bittersweet tale of the passing of one generation and the coming of another. It wasn't intended as a requiem for the genre, but it's certainly one of the last great traditional American Westerns.

It doesn't hurt that parts of it are staggeringly beautiful, with actor-turned-director Mark Rydell, perhaps the least likely Western helmer of the 70s, showing a remarkable visual sense and a gift for choosing just the right angle and the right lens to get the most out of every visual opportunity. He and cinematographer Robert Surtees also know exactly how to use the Scope frame to its fullest to make the film look genuinely epic without falling just into travelogue prettiness - they give it a real sense of energy when it's needed, as does John Williams superb score, richly drawing on Western tradition but not overlooking the emotion.

The cowboys themselves are a particularly good and credible ensemble, but although they ultimately take centre-stage it's the grownups who leave the biggest impression. There's a fine, rich performance from Roscoe Lee Browne, relishing the rich language and largeness of his teller of tall tales and font of quiet wisdom without ever tipping over into complete ham, always knowing when to tone it down and more than a match for Wayne. By contrast, Bruce Dern's villain opts for the kind of performance that at times could almost be written off as bug-eyed ham if not for the fact he seriously does seem to be intensely dangerously crazy for real (as the retrospective making of featurette reveals, he made a point of being almost as intimidating to the boys offscreen as on to help their scenes along). It's no surprise that the part earned him years of hate mail though, as he told Wayne on the set, ""They'll sure love me in Berkeley!""

But it's the Duke's film, the star delivering a beautifully subtle performance that manages to tell you everything you need to know without ever spelling it out. His early scenes with Sarah Cunningham as his wife, economically essaying their quietly loving relationship are absolutely convincing - you really believe these two have shared their lives - without seemingly doing much: their performances and body language just a perfect fit. Similarly his early scenes with Slim Pickens have an unspoken familiarity and quiet warmth just by the relaxed and familiar way they hold themselves in each other's company that tells you more than pages of dialogue ever could. Although Rydell originally wanted George C. Scott for the lead it's impossible to imagine any other actor in the part: more than his own considerable reputation in the genre, he brings a remarkable underplayed sensitivity to the role. After the shoot he told Rydell it was his favourite film, and while it was far from the only film he said that of, you can feel a real connection with the part in every frame. It's the kind of quietly towering performance that never overwhelms the film but manages to lift it to another level, and while it may not have got the praise it deserved at the time it's one of the great ones of the 70s.

The film was originally cut in the UK - Colleen Dewhurst's entire role as a travelling Madame was removed to get the film a lower rating - but the DVD and Blu-ray are fully restored, even including John Williams' remarkable overture as well as the intermission and entr'acte from the film's US roadshow presentations. The picture quality on the Blu-ray is particularly good,, making the most of the remarkable landscapes, while there's a fine selection of extras (also included on the deluxe edition DVD): the aforementioned half-hour retrospective documentary with Rydell and many of the cowboys as well as Dern and Rydell, an original 1972 making of short, the theatrical trailer and a good audio commentary from an enthusiastic and justifiably proud producer-director. And make no mistake, The Cowboys is certainly a Western to be proud of.",1374796800,3,4580,4.883033419023136

I fell in love with this movie because it was intriguing to see this aged rancher handle a bunch of school boys and turn them into cowboys. At the beginning of the movie, we see Wil Anderson wondering where his cowhands are when they finally show up. Their spokesman tells him they want to try their hand at mining for gold but if it doesn't pan out, they would return. He told them to get off his ranch which left him with no one to help him herd cattle to another state for slaughter. Solution? School boys. With an African-American cook to help out, and an iron will, he teaches them to grown up along the way where there is a lot of work and little sleep. Added to the action is a group of outlaws led by a man chillingly played by Bruce Dern. I won't give the plot away although I figure most have seen it anyway, but there are lessons learned for the boys and for Wil. The initial ending is rough, but the final ending is heart-warming and should have encouraged me to see more of John Wayne, but for now I am pleased to be able to put The Cowboys on when the desire to do so strikes me.",1373932800,3,1297,4.130434782608695

884861,3,6304457278,"While not great by Hollywood standards (how many Duke flicks actually were?), relative to other Duke flicks and westerns in general, ""The Cowboys"" is actually a great watch. You won't have the constant action of a ""Wild Bunch"", nor the drama of a ""High Noon."" But that hardly seems the poiint of this movie. John Wayne is at his avuncular best while still retaining the bravado we all grew to know and love. Unusual story of Wayne's hiring of school boys to help him on his cattle drive brings a different twist to the ending. But the Duke okays the gutsy plot twist that will forever leave ""The Cowboys"" as one of the most memorable Wayne flicks of all time. Bruce Dern has one of his more effective roles as Wayne's antagonist. Forget those who say this movie isn't for kids. Most westerns weren't designed necessarily to teach kids morals, nor lessons. This film is no exception. But like any great western, you'll cheer, you'll hate, and you just might choke up. Many like myself, wanted the story to continue but were betrayed by a sappy, ill-conceived TV series that went nowhere. This is a must see for John Wayne fans and those who like a different twist to their westerns. I'd even say this is a movie lots of kids would like, especially given the content in most movies that kids watch today.",1373328000,,1302,4.568376068376068

The difference is this is at the end of his career. For whatever reason, his character seems more genuine here than in any prior or subsequent movie. There are several poignant moments that make it genuine and expose an unseen side of Wayne. He deals with age, his love of the West and it's hardships, and his acknowledgement of its fading glory. Roscoe Lee Brown's bunkhouse tale of his heritage, the mystery that he holds over his young white bunk mates, and his disciplined nature have him competing with the Duke for who's in control in this movie.

884913,4,6304457278,"This is not the finest John Wayne movie, but is certainly one of his best...he turned in a lot of his best work during the last years of his life. When I first read the liner notes for this film, I thought it would be on the hokey side...an aging frontier rancher loses his experienced cowhands right before the annual cattle drive; and not being able to find anyone else, hires a crew of kids for the drive...literally, ""cow-boys"". But don't reject this film, thinking it is lightweight...it is not by a long shot. With excellent production values; a fine directorial effort by Mark Rydell (""On Golden Pond""); breathtaking cinematography; and exceptionally fine performances by the entire cast, this is easily a four-star Western and doesn't miss five stars by much, on a scale of 1-5. Wayne turns in one of his most polished acting performances; Roscoe Lee Brown turns in the best performance of his career (my opinion) and the young men and boys who play the cowboys are perfectly cast...watch for an 18 year old Robert Carradine in his first film appearance. Bruce Dern has been typecast as a villain throughout his career and he plays the villain, Long Hair, to exquisite perfection in this film. In a reported repartee between Wayne and Dern, Wayne said, ""The American people are going to hate you after this film.""; to which Dern replied, ""Yeah, but they'll love me in Berkley.""

885139,5,6304457278,"I just watched ""The Cowboys"" starring John Wayne again for research, and I'd forgotten just what a great movie this is.  This was Robert Carradine's first film, and in the special features of the DVD, he says he thinks this was John Wayne's best performance, and he may be right.  If not, it is up there among the best.  Wayne was getting older, and his health wasn't the best, and that added to the tired Wil Andersen that he portrayed, but he still had the toughness to him.

Bruce Dern did a great job as the villain, and Roscoe Lee Browne's performance as Jebediah Nightlinger added much to the film, as did the fine young cast of cowboys.  Mark Rydell did a fantastic job of directing and the scenery was magnificent but not overbearing.

It's a story about growing up, the importance of being a role model, of doing what's right, and getting a job done.  All qualities The Duke stood for, and in this film, they all ring true.  It is a great western with a great performance by one of the most legendary tough guys, John Wayne.

The extras on the DVD, especially the interview with the director and some of the cast years later add to the package.  A must for fans of John Wayne, and also great for those who like a good western movie.

John Wayne plays ""Will Anderson"" owner of a ranch and herd of cattle that need to be driven to market.  He has to hire local schoolboys because all the other men around his area are on ""gold fever"" absence.  This is a great story and excellent acting.  Roscoe Lee Browne is the cook during the cattledrive and is full of wisdom and mystery, Bruce Dern is the bad guy who ""oozes"" evil from the very beginning.  Robert Carradine is one of the cowboys so is A. Martinez.  This is one of the few movies in which John Wayne's character doesen't survive, but he sure does give the bad guy a big ""whoopin"".

885167,5,6304457278,"I first saw this film on TV during the 70's as a teenager. The boys in the film come across a group of women camping in the woods. I didn't notice right away the women were prostitutes. It only became apparent to me near the end of their conversation. A friend of mine who was also watching this film on TV said he knew it right away - duh what else would they be doing?

This is a cowboy movie for those who don't like cowboy movies. I don't really like westerns. It's my favorite cowboy movie though. The cowboys in this movie really are boys, ages 13 to 20, and not 20 and 30 somethings playing teenagers. It's a coming of age film. I've seen this film a few times over the years. Last time I watched I noticed how the film is so very politically correct. There's the indian cowboy, the black cowboy, the white cowboy, all saying the appropriate things. It doesn't get in the way of the film really. There were black cowboy heroes in the old west. Here the black actor plays the cook who drives the chuck wagon. He has a lessor role than Wayne but he has his own independent job. Don't know if there were indian/mexican cowboys in the old west. Well, I guess there were. At least I've seen a few of them in movies.

In one scene Jebediah Nighlinger, the black cook, tells the boys a story of how his grandparents were kings with their own estates. Afterward he mutters to himself, ""If it ain't true, it aught to be"".

Bruce Dern, playing a cattle rustler, murders Wil Anderson, John Wayne's character. It's reported that Wayne warned Bruce Dern, ""America will hate you for this"". Dern replied, ""Yeah, but they'll love me in Berkeley"". You can just hear John Wayne's voice saying this almost as a question, ""America will hate you for this"". He speaks lines like this in so many of his movies, ""You sure you want to ride that Bronco over there""? It can be a compliment in it's own way. It brings restraint to a type of reactionary character Wayne often played, perhaps. It's something that could be used now, perhaps, in our age of political correctness. A bit of free will.

A reviewer who gave this a negative review claimed the movie celebrates drunkeness and bad behavior. Perhaps this is true (so many films do) but I didn't notice it here. Actually, the film shows the boys getting drunk for the first time and getting very, very sick. They have bad hangovers the next day. To me this was cautionary. When they meet the prostitutes Mr. Nighlinger tells them, with due respect, their first time should be with a girl they think they are in love with.

I didn't notice this when I watched the film the first couple of times (the joys of an education I guess), but in the end, when the cowboys gun down the cattle rustlers, getting back their herd of cattle and avenging the death of Wil Anderson, each cowboy is shown in a still frame, like in a photo. Their faces are hard and fixed in determination as they do what must be done. I noticed it resembled those old photos of lynchings. I assume it was meant to. It is a film about the old West. A very good film. You don't need to be a fan of the Western to appreciate this one, it's a cowboy movie for those who don't like cowboy movies.

The story in a nutshell: John Wayne needs to run a cattle drive, and all his cowboys have run off because they heard there's gold in them thar hills. So the Duke and Slim Pickins lasso a band of pre-teen greenhorns to the task. 'Nuff said. This film was an instant classic for the primary school set when it came out (I suppose I was part of the target demographic: I was seven). All the kids flocked to see this one, they ran home and told their friends, and the Duke easily earned a whole new generation of fans. This is an elegant film; it boasts an unbeatable John Williams score and breaktaking cinematography. Some say the storyline is thin; I defy them to list a Western whose storyline is thick. It's not ""thin"" because it's got an untried gimmick in the fact that all the cowboys are actually kids. That's what gives it great kid appeal. And if that still doesn't interest you, perhaps you'll enjoy Roscoe Lee Browne's tour-de-force performance as the cattle drive's philosophical cook. Any kid would be as enthralled as the kids in the movie were when Roscoe spins a bedtime yarn about his father, who supposedly battered down the door of a castle and killed everyone inside--just so he could get a good night's sleep. The bedtime story scene is definitely one of the highlights of the movie and one of Roscoe Lee Browne's finest performances, ever. The Duke is long in the saddle and unlike today's aging celebrities, makes no mistake about it. His aging was an ongoing plot point in most of his twilight movies, and rightly so. Too bad the 60-something old codgers today try to pretend they're still 35. Bruce Dern is a terror in the part of a bandit who trails Wayne and the kids across the wilderness. One of his best villain roles. There's nothing unentertaining about this film, and not a single frame was wasted. It's something to see. As for the blu-ray itself, hmm...well, the soundtrack seems like it's in fine shape. The picture, well, I'm on the fence about it. There's a lot of shots that look (to me) a little off-register. The longshots aren't too clear and some of the close-ups seem to suffer from a bit of edge enhancement. There's a few shots where the Duke looks like he was wearing a hell of a lot of make-up. Maybe he was. I don't think it's the best blu-ray transfer ever, but it did come out in the earlier days of blu, so maybe they hadn't gotten their act together. The Cowboys has been reduced to bargain prices, and is well worth it simply for the reunion footage documentary. See what the Cowboys look like now! All in all, if you can find it at a bargain price, it's worth it.

With due respect given to ""Unforgiven"" and ""Lonesome Dove,"" he's not far off.  From 1972, this was one of John Wayne's final, fine films - and surely one of his best.  As Wil Anderson, he has no choice but to recruit a group of actual ""cowBOYS"" to lead a cattle drive of 1,500 steer across 400 miles of rough country.  Robert Surtees was the cinematographer and one of the greatest in his field - every shot in this picture is a work of art. The music by John Williams is one of his finest scores - indeed it is regularly performed at high schools and colleges across the country, including the Boston Pops.  It is uplifting, bittersweet, and rousing all at once. The supporting performances, particularly memorable and timeless ones by Bruce Dern, Roscoe Lee Brown, and Colleen Dewhurst (who praised Wayne in her autobiography as a great actor), and the young cowboys themselves, all so emotionally engaged in their roles that none of it feels like acting, add to the grit and texture of the tale. And then there is John Wayne: timeless, heroic, and, as in the best of his performances, filled with good humor, and a vulnerablity and sensitivity that ignorant critics seem to always miss.  He seemed to make it a habit of appearing in several of the greatest films ever made - and this is close to being one of them. Yes, the movie is violent.  Yes, the boys forced into becoming killers makes it a strong story.  But that is life too.  We all wish for an ""easy ride"" through life - but it never happens.  The film's message, beautifully foreshadowed at the beginning of the film with the schoolhouse scenes, which show a well meaning school marm trying to teach the boys genteel and sensitive things, is that life is, as Wil Anderson states in the film, ""hard,"" and these boys, as much as we'd like to see them sheltered, have to learn that sooner rather than later.  It's interesting the criticism the film has garnered - which tells you that critics knew it would have staying power because of its many virtues - because SO many of today's films ARE needlessly violent, with no theme, meaning, or story often apparent - and yet these films are regularly extolled for being ""real"" and somehow justified in their awfulness just because they show scenes of violence or perversion. ""The Cowboys"" is actually a REAL movie - splendidly filmed, written, scored, and acted - with amazing performances that pit the older star Wayne against the ""Method Actors"" of his time and he not only holds his own, he towers over them, without ever seeming to.  It's a film that has improved with age. It speaks to our own confused era. I was the same age as the ""cowboys"" in the film when I first saw it.  Now, many years later, expecting to find it wanting from my memories, it has only grown in stature - it was made with exquisite craftsmanship and it's there in every frame.  Rydell's and the other's memories of John Wayne in the extra featurette, which is a wonderful addition to this DVD - which includes an actual set of 10 black and white postcards, suitable for framing (what a deal!) - may bring you to tears.  Wayne almost begged Rydell for the lead part saying, ""I'll do a great job for you, if you give me a chance.""  This is John Wayne speaking here - forthright, sensitive, not full of himself, and one of the greatest actors the film world has ever seen. There is no one even close today - no one.  Grab this film and see how it's really done. One last note: this movie also has one other special feature that today's no longer have and which is also missed: an ""Overture"" of the music's marvelous music before the film begins, which used to let you anticipate the great event you were about to see; then an ""Intermission,"" with more music, and ""Exit Music"" at the end.

885305,3,6304457278,"** Some necessary SPOILERS near the end of this review **

John Wayne made 23 films in the last decade and a half of his career after the banner year of 1962 in which he managed to put out 4 top-notch pieces of work (HOW THE WEST WAS WON, THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE, HATARI! and THE LONGEST DAY), but though many of the later movies are fondly rememembered by his fans (particularly the older ones who were around when these films first came out), few are particularly well regarded critically, and the directors he was working with just weren't generally on the level of Ford and Hawks anymore.  This isn't to say that the 60s and 70s were disastrous by any means - he worked with Hawks twice more as a matter of fact, and there are still at least a couple of outright classics in my opinion - TRUE GRIT and THE SHOOTIST.  But there's no question that most of his greatest work was behind him, and it didn't help that Wayne resisted the changing natures of the western and the war film, still prefering to make ""family""-oriented, often rather sanitized films with old-fashioned values and little or no realistic violence, language or sex.

Of course, his great films of the 40s and 50s might seem just as anachronistic and ""dated"" today as the later, lesser work - but both the films and Wayne himself had more energy and juice, and the Duke seemed more often able to work at the service of a screenplay and a directorial vision - rather than simply hoping there was enough in the star vehicle with himself as the center for the film to succeed.  Most of his films still did all right at the box office, so he had no reason to tamper with his formulas: the Duke was always the hero - flawed perhaps, but never deeply so, always the moral center and often the imparter of wisdom to his typically much younger costars, always the exemplar of a definite and simple ""right"".

Certainly Mark Rydell's film THE COWBOYS seems to fit this pattern in most respects, at least at the beginning, though it's not without interest. Wil Andersen (Wayne) is a rancher in circa 1876-77 Montana who loses all of his ranch hands to a gold strike and is left with a herd of cattle that he needs to move 400 miles east to market. He has no idea what to do until his friend Anse (Slim Pickens in a tiny throwaway role) suggests that he take on a group of local schoolboys, aged 10-15 or so. Andersen of course rejects the idea initially but Anse convinces him (in about 30 seconds) that they're no younger than he was when he started on his first cattle drive. Roscoe Lee Browne as Jebediah Nightlinger completes the crew as cook and driver of the chuckwagon, and soon after the drive starts we run into a trio of ex-convicts looking for work who Andersen rejects for lying to him. Their leader, curly-haired and evil-looking Bruce Dern, doesn't take kindly to Andersen's curt dismissal, and we know he'll be back.

In its first hour and a half or so, THE COWBOYS is fine entertainment - if a little silly at times. The boys were mostly nonprofessional actors - some were burgeoning stunt men and rodeo cowboys - but Rydell's a good director of kids, and their interactions with each other and with Wayne and Brown rarely feel forced or false. Robert Carradine as Slim and A Martinez as Cimarron - a Mexican or Native American cowody, it's never made clear - are probably the standouts, and the two actors have had the most notable careers of any of the kids. The early bronco-busting scene which Andersen uses to test the kids is well done and there's a nice sequence in the latter part of the film when the kids get ahold of a bottle of whisky that Nightlinger and Andersen occasionally dip into. All of this is reasonably fine ""family entertainment"", and even the larger question of how Andersen could possibly think he could use nothing but kids and one other adult who approaches his own 60 years to drive cattle for weeks can be disregarded to some extent. Kids had to grow up early in the Wild West I guess.

Wayne himself is fine as the grizzled veteran rancher who, interestingly, has a seemingly quite negative attitude about violence - confiscating all of the kids' guns early on and locking them up, and warning them against a confrontation with Dern's gang of bandits even when it become apparent that there won't be a choice late in the film. He's matched in his ability to command the screen by Browne, who certainly seems more than a little out-of-place here, not because of his race but rather for his Ivy League rhetoric professor voice. Certainly his was one of the most mellifluous and perfect speaking voices in all of Hollywood history, and it never stops sounding a little weird coming from a guy driving a chuckwagon in 1870s Montana. But again - a suspension of disbelief is in order already, and Browne's a good sport about it and has a good rapport with Wayne, even though he apparently had no desire to do the film given the star's well-known hard-right conservatism and opposition to many Civil Rights issues. Somehow they must have worked it out, at least on camera.

Bruce Dern is fine also, doing his typical nasty evil-eyed psycho, playing the role that Wayne suggested would make him the most hated man in Hollywood - the man who shoots John Wayne in the back at the climax of the film, as Andersen confronts ""Long Hair"" (Dern's character never gets a name). But he's a cypher, just a faceless ""bad guy"", and as he and Andersen come together the film starts to fall apart. What had been a rather fun and optimistic cattle ride movie becomes at the end a bloody quest for vengeance as the boys refuse to leave Andersen's death - and the bandits' theft of his cattle - unpaid for. Which would all make a little bit more sense if the film had led up to it in an even faintly realistic fashion. Andersen just allowing himself to get shot several times in the back makes no sense after he beats the crap out of Long Hair, and Nightlinger's willingness to join in the quest for vengeance after a half-hearted argument against it also seems out of character and ridiculous. We've been told that the boys can shoot, early on, but never seen any evidence of it over the course of the film, and the few conversations about violence and war that we hear aren't exactly of the ""they do it to you, you got to do it to them"" variety. Not that we don't sympathize with the kids - it's just that it takes the film in a 180-degree turn and feels like a ""movie"" ending to a film which - however unrealistic overall - had at least a slight feeling of dramatic consistency to it.

The music by John Williams, though occasionally overbearing and very reminiscent of Aaron Copland at times, is probably some of his best and fits the rousing, boy's adventure mood of most of the film quite well. I watched the old Warner Brothers DVD which drains much of the beauty of Robert Surtees' widescreen photography into a series of muddy and dusty browns; it appears that the Blu-Ray is much, much better.

Overall then a lesser film in the late career of John Wayne; better for me than his work with Andrew V. McLaglen (McLINTOCK! and CHISUM), but not on a par with the couple I mentioned in the first paragraph or THE WAR WAGON. The three adult leads keep it watchable enough and Rydell keeps things moving along - the film is over 130 minutes long and doesn't need to be, but it doesn't feel boring either.  Some missed opportunities and bad decisions involving the direction of the narrative are really what keep this from being a solid piece of work all around.",1267315200,2,7555,4.506569343065693

885379,5,6304457278,"The Cowboys is, in my opinion, the most subtle, complete and compelling performance of John Wayne's career.  As the taciturn ranch owner/cattleman Wil Andersen, he's had to bury his only two sons, admitting that either they went bad or he went bad on them.  As his pending cattle drive approaches, his ranch hands desert him in order to strike it rich.  Left with the daunting task of moving his cattle across country, he hires on 11 boys, none older than 15 years.

With a supporting cast overflowing with talent, including the school teacher played by Allyn Ann McLerie, the fickle, gold fevered ranch hand played by Matt Clark and of course Andersen's close friend and confidant Anse played by the immortal Slim Pickens, they all have extensive and decades long careers as excellent character actors.

Then there's the main cast.  John Wayne is at his iconic best, with a performance as deep and compelling as he ever gave.  I find that in many of his early films his performances are interesting to watch, but I personally can never get past the star to see the character.  Even in his Oscar turn as Rooster Cogburn in True Grit, he's a bit of a caricature to me.  In The Cowboys, however, I believe 100% that he IS Wil Andersen.

Bruce Dern, who is also capable of delivering a performance which can be over the top, is truly evil and threatening in his role as ""Long Hair"".  Check out the scene in which he ambushes a the young cowboy Dan and threatens him to within an inch of his life.  Painful to watch, because it seems so true.

Roscoe Lee Browne is heartwarming as both a source of amazement for the boys and as their most staunch defender when it comes to Andersen's treatment of them.  He plays a black man in the old west with grace, dignity, style and charisma like nobody else could have, not to mention having the most sonorous black male voice next to James Earl Jones.

Colleen Dewhurst makes a delightfully strong appearance as a madame in the plains in the center of the cattle drive.  She is simply unforgettable.

Last but not least, there are the cowboys themselves.  Many of them had never acted before, but were chosen for their expertise at riding and roping, most notably Clay O'Brien (Cooper) who was an 11 year old rodeo champ who looks in the film to be no older than 9.  For 6 of the boys, this was their first film, and for some of those, their only film.  A Martinez, Robert Carradine, Nicolas Bauvy, and Stephen Hudis, Steve Benedict, Norman Howell and Sean Kelly went on to careers as either actors, stunt players or both.  Their honesty, presence and believability make this film a coming of age story like no other.

The film deals with many subjects.  Honor, bravery, courage, dedication, respect, and love.  We see a despondent Wil Andersen contemplating the graves of his sons early in the film and feel his sadness as he acknowledges his failure as a father.  Later in the film as he addresses the boys for the last time, it becomes apparent that he has inadvertently been given a ""second chance"" at being a father and says what I'm sure he wished he had said to his actual sons.  We also see early in the movie a battle between two bulls in which Andersen explains the dynamic between the two combatants.  The young one has strength while the old one has experience.  This scene foreshadows the later battle between Andersen and Long Hair.  From Andersen, the boys learn the value of honor, courage, and dedication, while they in turn teach Andersen the meaning of compassion, with a little help from Nightlinger (Browne) as sort of a Jiminy Cricket.

The cinematography is splendid, with grand vistas of the open plain.  The wardrobe and props seem to have come straight out of an old trunk found in a time capsule that had been buried long ago.  The music elicits excitement, suspense and an entire catalog of other emotions, but that's no surprise as it was composed and conducted by the immortal John Williams, the most prolific and memorable composer in all of film history.

I own this movie and watch it frequently.  Coming in at over two hours in length, the movie has not one wasted scene and never slows down.  It's hard to believe that it's 131 minutes long, and when it's over, I always find myself wishing there was more.

If you've never seen The Cowboys, watch it and you'll be glad you did.  If you have, watch it again and you'll be glad you did!",1240012800,7,4407,4.575255102040816

The addition of Rosco Lee Brown was delightful and added a great deal to the film, more growth for the boys & even a bit for the main character.

885451,4,6304457278,"The Cowboys is not your standard John Wayne Western movie. Two big differences. First off, due to circumstances, the Duke has to work with schoolboys for this cattle drive. A task he is not too found of, but that he takes head on. But, I guess that is the main point of the movie...what would it take to teach school boys how to handle a man's job. According to this movie, a whole lot of man sized training. Second, John Wayne dies in the movie, and pretty early by Wetern standards. I was a little surprised by this turn of events, but is does help make the main bad guy out to be much meaner than most since he guns the Duke down in cold blood.

Apparently, the movie was pretty controversial when released, I can see why given some of the tough love that the Duke shows the boys. I have a feeling that this movie still has a place in a young man's life, despite some of the violence it invokes. If you are a John Wayne fan, then you should see this movie.

I am not normally a fan of Westerns or of the Duke because of his conservative politics but I have to admit this is one gem in Duke's crown. Roscoe Lee Browne, Bruce Dern (at his most villainous) and Colleen Dewhurst in a brief, but amusing turn as a madam are excellent.  Mark Rydell shines in his first directorial effort at a Western.

The standard definition transfer of The Cowboys is simply very poor.  The colors are faded and the whole picture is marked and grainy.

Gradually, they do. Indeed, if you like horsemanship, this movie is for you! There are numerous scenes of skillful horse riding, lassoing of cattle, branding of cattle, breaking-in of recalcitrant horses, the crossing of treacherous rivers on horseback, and much more. Much of this occurs on the cattle drive, where the toughness of the boys is pushed to the limit.

There are some boyish episodes shown. The boys scare girls in their classroom with frogs. They have their fistfights. They talk about unclad females.  During the cattle drive, they steal some hard liquor from the adults just to see what it is like to get drunk. They find out!

Some viewers may feel uncomfortable about the fact that the African-American cook is habitually called the N-word in this movie. But that is a concession to the usage at the time.

The cattle drive turns deadly. A bunch of rustlers are out to steal the cattle.  Wil Anderson is ambushed. What will the boys do? Will they revert to childhood helplessness, or will they behave like men and take charge?",1200268800,6,1214,4.8173076923076925

885597,5,6304457278,"I am not a John Wayne fan, nor do I particularly like westerns, but this one is one for the ages. I would not recommend it for watching with any children under, say, at least 12 or 13, and I would certainly recommend watching it WITH them (actually in the same room).

The characters are typical for this type of film-- John Wayne is a gruff, reluctant cattle driver who has to settle for hiring a bunch of young men and boys to get the cattle where they need to go. The cook is a well spoken, but hardly namby-pamby, educated black man. The boys are just that, trying to become men as soon as they can. Playing these roles are the likes of Robert Carradine and A Martinez.

This is definitely a movie from the 70s. The boys are on a cattle drive, for cripe's sakes! They're going to swear and compete against each other in all kinds of ways. They visit a whorehouse. Don't watch this movie if you have a lofty ideal of what boys would do if they were alone with just the guys. The point of the movie is that they all gain something from being on the drive with Wil Andersen (Wayne) as their boss. And when they come home, they're men. Bruce Dern's character is the one that forces this change, but Wayne's character is the one they emulate. And no, he isn't ""politically correct"" (Did I mention that this is a western from the 70s?) or particularly fatherly. He's a man-- a man with scruples who literally turns his back on those who have none.

This is a movie that almost everyone can enjoy if they don't ask for anything more than what it is: an excellent coming-of-age western made in the 1970s. This is about honor and setting things right.

885672,4,6304457278,"I had never watched ""The Cowboys"" before because, when it first came out, the concept of John Wayne leading a bunch of kids on a cattle drive didn't appeal to me.  However, the awareness that this was one of 30 some John Wayne movies I hadn't seen led me to watch it last night.  I was impressed.  For one thing, I could tell from the beginning that this was a major production for its' day.  The cinematography was impressive and the location and sets were well done too.  The case for why a school room-full of kids were chosen for the job was credibly made and the journey begins.  There's a fair amount of action and entertainment along the way.  John Wayne gives a good performance as the cattleman who comes to respect his trailhands.  There is some suspenseful conflict with some bad guys and something that rarely happens in a John Wayne film occurs.  I won't say what it was but I could only think of ""The Shootist"" and, in an indirect way, ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" as the other times it occurred after ""The Alamo"".

The kids give a credible performance and so does Roscoe Lee Brown.  Interestingly, there was a bit actor with the last name Canutt who showed up on the credits (as one of the bad guys).  Could it the Duke found work for a relative of his old sparring partner Yakima Canutt?  Collen Dewhurst is featured but she's over-billed for her gratuitous part.

John Wayne is at his avuncular best while still retaining the bravado we all grew to know and love.

My father taught me how to shoot a .22 pistol when I was in the [...] to protect the family from snakes that slithered and those who wandered in from the Interstate looking for trouble.

This film is fantastic.  And according to my own experience and family stories about myself, my father, my grandfather and his brothers, the film's message that cowboys began their work at an early age makes sense.  During this time, boys learned responsibility at an early time in their lives.  For those who know anything about history, think about the young soldiers who fought and unfortunately died in the Civil War.  Just because our present mind set views things differently, doesn't mean that the past held the same stereotypes to be true.

Roscoe Brown is another inspired piece of casting as the sagely cook.  His was a Oscar caliber performance.

In my book, this picture has Bruce Dern's best performance as an evil doer.  His psychopathic rustler is a flawless jewel.

And despite these excellent qualities what really makes this film so good and sets it apart is it's concept-

Cowboys herding cattle that are really boys, facing the harsh unforgiving environment of the old west and dealing with it as best they can.

Casting the cowboys they used a mix of Hollywood child actors and kids that grew up on ranches and had riding and roping skills.  This worked out incredibly well.

The Movie:
Here we have John Wayne as Wil Anderson a Cattleman who is forced to use young school boys for his cattle drive after his ranch hands are stricken with gold fever. It is a rising tale that I personally rank as one of my favorite of the dukes movies. Along for the ride are many stars you will notice Roscoe Lee Brown, Bruce Dern, Robert Carradine (revenge of the nerds), and Slim Pickens (Blazing Saddles).

The Video
Here we have a widescreen transfer that has been greatly improved from the earlier flip case release. It is no longer pixeled and is enhanced for larger TV's. It has some edge flicker but all in all a good transfer for a film made in 1972.

The audio
It has also received and upgrade to 5.1 Dolby. It is crisp and no crackle during gun shots it is very good making u almost flinch with every shot.

The Extras
Mark Rydell Commentary
It's a nice commentary kind of peaceful. The only bad part of it is that he seems to run out of things to say and he repeats himself. On a personal not it been nice if David Carridine, Roscoe Lee Browne  and a few of the other boys to join him.

The Cowboys Together Again
A charming tale of memories of the movie paying honor to the director, John Wayne and Roscoe Lee Browne.  It is one of the best insights into a movie I have had the honor to watch.

The Breaking of Boys The Making of men.
This is and odd extra it's really grainy. It's of course about training the actors to ride Horses and become horsemen. It is a hard to watch feature mainly because it is so grainy. It's just something to watch once not something to cherish but nice they added it.

885751,5,6304457278,"An aging Wil Andersen (John Wayne) takes a bunch of near-adolescent boys on a last summer cattle drive and along the way they become his boys and he becomes their ""father"" (or perhaps grandfather).  It is vintage John Wayne, as he plys the young boys into young men of courage and responsibility.  Wayne had lost both of his natural sons to reasons never fully explained, and he muses whether ""they went bad on him or if he went bad on them"".  The cattle drive is his chance to redeem himself as a father figure.

The group of cowboys is a humorous gathering of personalities.  One chuckles seeing them learn the ropes of breaking horses and roping steers.  The boys see this as a chance to earn some much needed money, and of course to ""come of age"", turning from boys into young men.

Wayne's cattle group is confronted by cattle theives led by the the evil intentioned Asa Watts (played brilliantly by Bruce Dern).  The climax of the movie is when Wayne confronts Dern in a mano-a-mano fist fight.  Dern's character is a slimy long-haired flea-infested sleeze, and when they face off for their battle, Wayne says as only Wayne can say: ""I've broke my back once, and my hip twice. And on my worst day I could still beat the hell out of you.""  It is a spirited battle and it appears as though Wayne will best the much younger Dern, but Dern, sensing defeat, pulls a gun and shoots Wayne, emptying his gun one slow shot at a time, shooting Wayne as he has his back turned.  It is a tortuous moment for Wayne fans, as the hero dies a slow horrible death, and it appears as though evil will triumph.  But quite unexpectedly, the boys turn the tables on the outlaws and wrest back the heard, finally killing the hated Dern.

The musical score is magnificent, and I recommend it as purchase in and of itself.  The main score is music that defines the western music motif.

This is one of Wayne's better movies.  People of all ages will enjoy it, but the killing scene of Wayne is quite graphic and may scare younger viewers.  I'd recommend that parents keep their littlest ones from viewing the violent scene between Wayne and Dern.  Many a boy became a John Wayne fan in watching this movie.

It is unlikely that 12-year-olds would participate in a cattle drive, granted, but it was entirely acceptable for 16- or 17-year-olds to ""do a man's work and make a man's wage"" in those days.  It was also a time when John Wayne's widow could not have filed an insurance claim for the stolen herd, or applied for Federal disaster relief, and the movie makes it clear that this herd represented the difference between a reasonable retirement and ""working out her days as someone's fry cook.""  Justice was often swift and harsh in the Old West because real people suffered real consequences from the effects of crime.  Therefore it was NOT a sense of vengence, as one reviewer asserts, that drove the later scenes, it was a sense of justice.  And while the ages of the ""cowboys"" in the film are a little too young, the film accurately reflects what used to be ""coming of age"" in frontier America:  A boy became a man when he accepted a man's responsibilities and did a man's work.",1127520000,23,1250,4.684931506849315

- All eleven kids getting together to get drunk, then lying about it, all with the tacit approval of the cook and Wayne.

- A couple of the kids riding in on a madam and her whores and presumably having their first ""experience"" (this is where I gave up)

It was also good to see Robert Carradine in one of his earlier roles as ""Slim"" Huneycutt.

  THE COWBOYS is an unusual western.  From all accounts the life of a cowboy was rough, dirty, and dangerous.  It takes some belief suspension to buy the premise that a dozen or so schoolboys could drive cattle.  I did buy the premise, finally, thanks in large part to the strong performances by John Wayne as Andersen and Roscoe Lee Browne as camp cook Jedediah Nightlinger.  Two-thirds of the way into it this movie throws a big surprise and the movie switches from a coming of age to a revenge tale.  If I had a hard time accepting the competency of the boys as cattle herders, I found it impossible to believe that they'd have a chance against Dern and his dirty dozen. That last plot switch lost me.

Many people may like other John Wayne movies more, but The Cowboys helped him break away from the tired, typical co-stars who were so prevalent in his earlier westerns. Credit must also be given to Bruce Dern who was very good as bad guy Asa Watts, and composer John Williams for his stirring theme music.

885897,3,6304457278,"Goodness, how my perception of this film has changed over the years.  When I first saw this pimple-faced shoot-'em-up in the theater, I was mesmerized, and I was part of the crowd that took to its feet and cheered when Bruce Dern got what was coming to him.  Over the years, as fatherhood and an expanding waistline greeted me, I would come across this motion picture and find myself wincing somewhat.  A Montana cattle drive, led by an aging rancher and a cook with a Shakespearean delivery, and a dozen or so boys not even old enough to shave as cowhands--yeah, right.

But this is John Wayne, and this is his senior citizen landmark film, THE COWBOYS.  The movie enjoyed resounding box office success, pleased the Duke's legions of fans, and even spawned an awful, short-lived TV series.  As rancher Wil Anderson, Wayne is his usual tough 'n gruff, crusty and cantakerous hombre; yet the Duke also reveals a kinder and gentler side as he becomes a father figure to his peach-fuzzed employees.  Yet as well as Wayne is in this role, the movie is so inherently flawed--first by the premise of young boys actually driving a herd of cattle, followed by these same boys going on a cold-blooded, avenging killing spree--I find myself growing more and more uncomfortable with each subsequent viewing.

Guess I'm getting mellow in my old age.

Bruce Dern is a perfectly hateable villain; Roscoe Lee Browne a wonderfully laughable and unbelievable chuckwagon cook who looks like he was plucked from the pages of 'Othello.'  Of the ensemble of 'Cowboys' young Robert Carradine is most noteworthy--and much more memorable via his 'Revenge of the Nerd' roles.  Yet, despite its flaws, THE COWBOYS is vintage John Wayne action and revenge, even though the violence is jarring and unsettling.

885898,5,6304457278,"Director Mark Rydell takes the acting and physical talents of veteran and rookie actors alike and melds them into a great cowboy flick.  John Wayne, in one of his last films, is his usual bigger-than-life presence as rancher Wil Andersen who is faced with the need to get his cattle to market but without any help to do it.  It just so happens that ""gold fever"" has struck his part of the West and all of the trail riders have turned into gold miners.  The only trail hands left to choose from are the 11 boys who attend the local school.  Andersen is faced with the challenge of herding both the cattle and the greenhorn cowboys 400 miles to market.
Andersen hires a black cook, Jebidiah Nightlinger, to feed the troupe and, after a few short days of learning the ""ropes"" of cattle herding, they set off on their mission.  Along the way, there are some great scenes, especially the night the boys discover the sour mash that Mr. Nightlinger has hidden in his chuckwagon and the scene where the cowboys meet up with a travelling group of prostitutes.  Bruce Dern as the evil rustler, Asa Watts, is outstanding as the movie's villan.  Dern has that great way of contorting his face and eyes to create that genuiunely creepy style of acting that he's displayed throughout much of his career.  In the scene where he captures one of the young cowboys and pumps him for information about the cattle drive, it appears that the young man really is terrified of Dern.
By now, the reader of this review probably knows that (for one of the few times in his acting career) John Wayne dies in ""The Cowboys"".  Without going into a lot of plot-revealing details, let me suffice to say that his death does not go unpunished.  The boys deliver the cattle to market and become men along the way.
As I was watching the film, it dawned on me about halfway through that ""The Duke"" would have made a great football coach.  Many of his lines even sound like things that a Vince Lombardi or Don Shula would say.  He starts out rough, gruff, and distant from the boys as they begin the journey, but eventually becomes more of a father, than an employer, to them by his exit from the film.  His pride in their accomplishments along the trail is evident in his last scene.
While not a classic Western in the mold of ""High Noon"" or ""Shane"", ""The Cowboys"" is a great movie for young and old alike.  John Wayne fans will find that it compares favorably to many of The Duke's movies from the '60s and '70s, such as ""Chisum"", ""El Dorado"", and ""Rio Bravo"".

885899,4,6304457278,"The Cowboys is a good but not great Duke western that benefits from good performances by the cast.  Because all the men in town are off in search of gold, rancher Wil Andersen is forced to hire 11 schoolboys to help him drive a herd of cattle to Montana.  Obvious problems arise on the trail as Andersen and his cook, Jebediah Nightlinger, try to help the boys learn how to be cowboys.  Andersen, Nightlinger, and the 11 cowboys also must deal with a band of rustlers threatening to steal their cattle herd.  The plot for this movie is nothing special, but it is still a very enjoyable movie.  John Wayne and Roscoe Lee Browne are very good as are the kids.  For a Duke western, the ending is a little shocking, but the revenge motive works here as the ""cowboys"" go after the rustlers.  The Cowboys is a beautifully shot movie in the barren desert and the green mountains that deserves a watch to see the Duke in one of his last movies.
  As usual, John Wayne is excellent as rancher Wil Andersen, who must watch out for the eleven schoolboys turned cowboys.  He takes on a father role to them which is very believable by the end of the movie.  Roscoe Lee Browne is also very good as Andersen's cook, Jebediah Nightlinger, who must deal with more than a little racism on the trail.  Bruce Dern with his rattlesnake theme is incredibly creepy as rustler, Long Hair, although sometimes his character has been called Asa Watts.  The 11 cowboys are all pretty good in their roles including Robert Carradine, A. Martinez, and Alfred Barker Jr.  The DVD offers widescreen presentation, production notes, a featurette on the making of, and trailers from 13 different John Wayne movies.  The Cowboys is not an action packed western, but it is still entertaining with good performances from the Duke, Roscoe Lee Browne, and Bruce Dern.  For an enjoyable western with a bit of a twist, check out The Cowboys!",1085184000,5,1898,4.604166666666667
885900,4,6304457278,"If you stop and think about it John Wayne actually made several westerns that took surprising twists.  In ""The Searchers,"" Wayne played Ethan Edwards, who spends the entire film tracking the neice who had been taken by Scar's band of raiders so that he can put a bullet in her brain, only to end up taking her home.  But for his legion of fans, ""The Cowboys"" had to be the biggest surprise of all.
As rancher Wil Andersen, Wayne finds that his hands have left him to join a gold rush and he has no one to help him get his herd of cattle to market before winter. His only option are a group of young school boys, a hot headed young gun man named Cimarron (A Martinez), and an old cook named Jedediah Nightlinger (Roscoe Lee Browne).  With hardly any training, Anderson and his ""cowboys"" hit the trail.  But not only do they have to do deal with hundreds of heads of cattle, rattlesnakes, and the elements, there are also a gang of man led by Asa Watts (Bruce Dern) following them as well.
I think that Bruce Dern had a pretty good career after this 1972 film, which was in doubt at that time because his character shoots down John Wayne in cold blood, which was definitely not considered a smart career move at the time.  Wayne warned Dern he would be hated and the young actor actually received death threats.  A movie in which John Wayne actually dies is always something of a shock for movie goers (e.g., ""Sands of Iwo Jima""), but usually that tragic fate is saved for the very end of the film and in ""The Cowboys"" there is still the entire final act of the story left to be told.  The one thing you have to admit is that no other actor being killed off in the middle of a western could shock you more than the Duke.
Of the young cast of the film, Robert Carradine is the one name that sticks out the most as having made a career of acting.  A few of the boys were cast in the short lived television series based on the movie but just as many did this one film and never acted again.  However, the choice performances in ""The Cowboys"" come from the older cast members, with Brown's eloquent Mr. Nightlinger having a choice encounter with Colleen Dewhurst, who plays a madam escorting her stable of pretty young women to their next town of business.  Of course, the young girls are interested in the young boys, but as she wisely declares, ""The first time should be in the back of a buggy with a girl that they think they're in love with.""  Then there is his charming refusal, ""I have the inclination, the maturity, and the where-with-all; but unfortunately, I don't have the time.""
Of course Wayne's character slowly comes around to the idea that these young cowboys can actually get the job done, but the film requires them to complete their final rite of passage without him.  This 1972 western provides Wayne with the final great fist fight of his career that say him make 174 films from 1926 when he was an uncredited Yale football player in ""Brown of Harvard"" to 1976 when he starred in his eloquent final film ""The Shootist.""  When Andersen begins his final fight his tells his opponent: ""I've broke my back once, and my hip twice. And on my worst day I could still beat the hell out of you.""  Yes, Bruce Dern must be a pretty good actor to survive shooting John Wayne in the back.",1085184000,2,3289,4.370491803278688

After turning down an offer by ex-convicts led by a sinister Bruce Dern, to move his heard to market, he is left with no choice but to hire young boys as stock movers.
After training and settling in, the Duke and his mob are on the move.  However the ex-convicts that the Duke turned away have more sinister plans for all of them.
In the meantime the Duke takes on a more fatherly role to his young charges and with his dependable cook (Roscoe Lee Brown)soon has them working as a cohesive unit.  That is untill they encounter the covects and during an altercation the Duke goes down.
Infuriated, the young Cowboys set out on a course of revenge resulting in the rather brutal yet satisfying end to the convict gang and retaking of the cattle herd which reaches the markets on time much to the amuzment of the Stock agents.

885903,5,6304457278,"Today's youth are lost without John Wayne. The movie ""The Cowboys"" attests to the fact that the values of integrity, honesty, and strength of character is lacking in most movies made since this one was released in the early 70s. The moral fiber that Wayne's movies instilled in children growing up and the adults raising them during the days of yesteryear has not been rekindled in our new era of special effects, gory death and sport bloodletting. Wonder why America's children are selfish gangsters and the materialistic adults raising them are oblivious? Perhaps because the qualities of humanity, leadership, and social justice that were portrayed in movies like The Cowboys vanished from the screen when John Wayne died in the mid-seventies.
Whoever decided that ""self-esteem"" should be the priority of child-rearing practices, that the mouthing the term ""respect"" is more important than receiving natural consequences for bad behaviour, and that children are really small adults and not boys and girls should be forced to take that last ride with LongHair.

It is one of the greatest westerns ever, in the same class as 'The Searchers', 'My Darlin' Clementine', 'Shane', 'High Noon', etc.  It is also one of Wayne's best performances. (By the way, the film is 135 minutes long and Wayne's character is killed with approximately 30 or 35 minutes to go. Contrary to Keogh's and some readers' reviews, he is not in the movie ""only a short time"".)
I would have rated The Cowboys with 5 stars but the DVD picture appears to be a mere transfer from the VHS edition. (I used to own the laserdisc and remember that version's picture quality as much better than the DVD.) While the sound has been remastered, the picture has not been remastered/ restored.  Frequently, through-out the movie, white marks and scratches appear on the screen.  It's a shame that Warner Brothers did not release this film on DVD with the care and respect it deserves.

885967,5,6304457278,"""The Cowboys"" was a fundemental change of direction for John Wayne in 1972, much in the way ""True Grit"" had been at the end of the sixties, and, in keeping with the trend towards more realistic progression in Cinema, Mark Rydell's film provided the aging Veteran with a role, that, while retaining epic scope, also had an edge to it, a more modern appearance and feel.  No Monument Valley or even familier Batjac Players, co starring Roscoe Lee Browne, Slim Pickens, Colleen Dewhurst and Sarah Cunningham. Elmer Bernstein is replaced by a fantastic and moving John Williams score.  It's a rite of passage story, which embraces regret, loss, caring, honour, violence, and ultimately morality and the vindication of that morality - even though such vindication sometimes comes at a very high price. The threat to morality and family is presented in the form of Bruce Dern, in an unforgettable and terrifying performance - and the suddness and brutality of that violence is very shocking indeed, much the same way as ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" was to Henry Fonda fans.  Beautifully photographed on location by Robert Surtees,the DVD restores the Overture, Intermission and Exit music as it was in the Cinema, complete with Widescreen presentation. The film is also funny & intelligent, with the Cowboys of the title giving wonderful performances, although instead of a PG rating, I'd give it a PG-13 .  Duke's final scene is perhaps one of the greatest He ever played. ""The Cowboys"" and ""The Shootist"" were the best movies of His late period.",1062288000,,1543,4.923076923076923
885968,4,6304457278,"I suppose you could call this a sort of 'cult-classic' among John Wayne films.  It is considered one of the Duke's best (maybe even THE best) by many people, yet many critics gave rather discouraging reviews of the film (see Amazon's Editorial review, for example).
This is an entertaining story about an old man who cannot hire enough men for his cattle drive, and who is forced to take along a group of boys instead.  This film finds Wayne in a somewhat different role, for although he plays a cattleman (not unusual for the Duke), he also has a soft, paternal side not often seen in his films.  This movie also differs in that Wayne does not emerge triumphant at the end of the film.
This is a great Western for any die-hard Western fan.  Not only fans of Westerns will enjoy this movie, however.  A great many people who do not like either the Duke or the Western genre thoroughly enjoy this movie, and perhaps that is what gives it such a lasting appeal.",1055721600,,959,4.457142857142857

However, THE COWBOYS is a film that spins a classic tale of young men coming of age and old men learning deep lessons. The Duke puts in one of his finest performances-- better perhaps than THE SHOOTIST where he portrays another doomed, old westerner. In an early role by Bruce Dern we see an impressive and terrifying piece of method acting. He embodies the post-Civil War Western badman with Southern origins. He is pure anger, frustration and evil.
  This movie is one I hold dear-- I was 6 years old when I first sat in a matinee at the old Fox theater in Bakersfield, CA, rooted to my seat and watching good battling evil, youth coming of age, and beautiful horses galloping across the Montana countryside under clear Rocky Mountain skies.
  There is some uneven acting, especially by the 11 boy actors that include Robert Carradine, A. Martinez and others. Some of the lines seem a bit stiff and artificial, and the killing at the end seems to take place without the moral and ethical introspection found in the novel, but all in all this is a fine movie and one that should be seen by any fan of the western genre.",1043193600,,1318,4.717391304347826

The things I like about this movie are numerous and contained generously in the other reviews here. What I wanted to comment on is some reviewers slamming this movie for it's violence.
One reviewer asks ""What if the postcard hue and gentle themes of the previous three quarters of the film had been maintained during the final 30 minutes?"" And then he answers himself saying, ""It could have been so much better"". I disagree.
A bucolic ending would have completely ruined this film. Not only is Wayne's death unexpected by the viewer (and a bit troublesome, ""He's dead??""), it is THE galvanizing event that transforms the greenhorn boys into men; their unpleasant welcome into the harsh adult world of the 1800's Wild West. It forced them to choose between remaining boys and going home or mustering their resolve to demonstrate they have learned the lessons Wayne was teaching them about being men. In the end, you will cheer when Dern's excellently portrayed bad guy gets his just desserts and you will be touched when the boys-turned-men complete their journey in the memory of their fallen leader.",1038268800,6,1237,4.839622641509434

Wayne plays the role very well, tough and sweet, and has a great cast of boys supporting him (including A Martinez and Robert Carradine). Bruce Dern is the villain, and he does a great job in the role, but then this is the type of role Dern is best in. This is also one of the few instances where John Wayne is killed onscreen, and done so by Dern. The whole scene is one of the best I've seen John Wayne in.

885975,3,6304457278,"John Wayne's 1972 film ""The Cowboys"" has always been one of his more interesting twilight westerns. It is blessed with one of the Duke's most gentle portrayals - in this case an aging rancher coming to terms with a past scarred by unyeilding obstinance. It is also one of the few times in his vast career that Wayne worked with filmmakers outside of his long-time clique (Ford, Hawks, Kennedy, McLaglen). The result is a very un-Wayne like film blessed with introspection, spectacular camera work, unique production values and a memorable musical score by a then-young John Williams.
Unfortunately, ""The Cowboys"" gets lost on the trail about three-quarters of the way in. Viewers must then suffer the misery of several violent deaths, attempted child molestation and an out-of-place Bruce Dern giving what must rank as one of the most famous villainous performances in cinema history. The end result should leave a bad taste in the mouths of most viewers, as what was an enjoyable family film with several strong messages about nobility, hard work and discipline, becomes just another violent western.
Most viewers already know that Wayne dies near the end of this film at the hands of the sadistic Dern. The symbolism during the now-famous fight scene is obvious. This film was made in 1971-72. The United States was still fighting in the Vietnam war. Protests on college campuses were still rampant across the country. And Wayne's stance about America's involvement was always readily apparent. Anyone who has ever seen a documentary on Wayne's life has seen the at-times painful footage of the Duke traveling to a college campus and being pelted by snowballs from angry students. Bruce Dern, complete with long hair (which is refered to in the film) and an anti-establishment look (long trenchcoat, cowboy hat with the bill turned up), symbolizes an angry generation of American youth. John Wayne stands up to this man, indeed sacrifices himself in order to send a message to the children of this film, and the children of America. The end result is heavy-handed to say the least.
In ""The Cowboys,"" John Wayne plays a Montana husband/rancher (one of his only westerns in which he has a wife) whose workers desert him during a gold rush. He then must take on about 10-11 local children to help him on a two-month trail drive to get the cattle to market. Wayne's character, carrying the scars of the deaths of two sons, soon becomes a surrogate father to these children.
There is much to like about this film. Slim Pickens and Roscoe Lee Browne provide memorable supporting performances; a camera shot of Wayne standing above the graves of his sons must rank as one of the finest images in this actor's spectacular career; the children's performances are uniformly strong; Wayne's repartee with his wife is genuine and touching; Mark Rydell's direction is strong and thematically consistent with his later work; and of course, the beginning of the trail drive makes several obvious references to a similar classic sequence in ""Red River.""
I have seen ""The Cowboys"" about 10 times and it is probably telling that I usually stop watching this film near the point when Bruce Dern and his faceless gang ambush Wayne's trail drive. A touching, gentle twilight western suddenly becomes mean-spirited and ugly. And what could have been a great film simply becomes average.
As a big fan of John Wayne, I have always considered ""The Cowboys"" to be an agonizing ""What if?"" What if the actor and the filmmakers had stuck to their guns? What if the postcard hue and gentle themes of the previous three-quarters of the film had been maintained during the final 30 minutes?

886048,3,6304457278,"THE COWBOYS isn't a terrible movie; it has some real merit. Wayne & Roscoe Lee Browne both turn in fine, mellow performances, and the leisurely pace of the story complements their work nicely. But the final 20 minutes is as cynically hand-tooled as a Dirty Harry movie, particularly the death of villain Bruce Dern, sadistically designed to turn on the audience and play to their well-stoked bloodlust. Dern's role embodied a new kind of hack writer's cliche -ironically emerging in the peace & love era of the late 60s/early 70s- the villain so repellently subhuman that no death, no matter how cruel or degrading, ever seems cruel or degrading ENOUGH. Dern is alarmingly well-suited to these roles; with his rodent features and demeanor, all he's missing is a snout and tiny paws to clutch cheese with. I suppose his character's demise is the reason why so many see the climax of THE COWBOYS as a passage-into-manhood rather than the descent into the maelstrom that it is. Too bad, as the early going here has its moments, most of them Browne and the Duke's, both in peak form. And that sneakily brings up another point, the oft-stated foolishness that Wayne had, here in his twilight years, finally learned to act. (Yeah, thank God Wayne finally escaped the confining clutches of career-killing hacks like John Ford & Howard Hawks, huh? God knows what he might've accomplished had he not been hampered by drivel like THE QUIET MAN or RED RIVER or THE SEARCHERS or RIO GRANDE.) What people respond to in his 70s work is that Wayne had finally begun getting parts that made constant reference to his being a old man and a dying-breed, fifth-face-on-Mt-Rushmore type living legend, and that sometimes the writing allowed him some dignity, as here. Many times these roles were damn-near offensive, the equivalent of winking nonstop at the audience, as in RIO LOBO and ROOSTER COGBURN. But the Duke, who'd made something like 70 movies BEFORE getting his big break on 1939's STAGECOACH, always knew more about acting, and displayed it, than critics and audiences ever gave him credit for. He knew what he could and couldn't get away with and honed his craft between those two borders. That he didn't win an Oscar until the Hallmark-card sentimental hogwash of TRUE GRIT, rather than for his great work with Ford or Hawks, is just one more reason nobody should take the Academy Awards seriously; and those people who hold their noses at his war movies ought to look at THEY WERE EXPENDABLE, as restrained and lyrical a 'flagwaver' as any nation at war could hope to produce. Even in pure-entertainment films like SEVEN SINNERS and REAP THE WILD WIND the Duke casts a mighty big shadow: this was an unselfish actor who knew and understood the craft well enough to let the other guy get the notices while taking care of the dirty work of selling the tickets. Sorry to momentarily diverge off the film at hand, but you too might be tempted, while watching THE COWBOYS, to believe John Wayne had suddenly 'discovered' how to act because the whole production is built around his acknowledgment of old age; don't you buy it. He'd mastered that particular trick 30 years earlier.",998956800,4,3169,4.81651376146789

Remembering this was  supposed to be in the 1800's the law was alot different then.  Thank you,  Brenda Goodvin",961286400,3,680,4.045454545454546
886054,5,6304457278,"Like the other reviewer before me, I cannot for the life of me understand the negative reviews by the professional cognoscenti. Unlike many other westerns, this plot is original and keeps the film moving. It's more  analagous to good triumphing over evil than strictly revenge. John Wayne is  great in this role as is the supporting cast.",953164800,5,338,4.912280701754386
886055,4,6304457278,"While I liked The Cowboys every bit as well as any John Wayne movie (except perhaps The Quiet man and Red River), I was quite disappointed when I saw it the first time.  I often used it when teaching high school English  as an example of the differences between the movie and the book.
When I  learned that The Cowboys was coming out as a movie, I read the book.  Throughout the story I could imagine how The Duke would portray Wil  Anderson in the movie.  Heck, I'd seen most of his movies, and I thought I  had him cold.
Then I saw the movie, and John Wayne screwed it up!  He  didn't do it like he did in the movie I saw in my head while reading the  book.  Very few of the scenes in his rather short appearance lived up to my  expectations.
The Cowboys became my best teaching example of how the  visions we see in our heads while reading are often more real and vivid  than what appears on the screen.
Don't get me wrong.  The Cowboys is an  excellent movie, and John Wayne's portrayal of Wil Anderson was certainly  masterful.  It's just that it fell short of my expectations--or were my  expectations too high?",944611200,2,1117,4.258373205741627
