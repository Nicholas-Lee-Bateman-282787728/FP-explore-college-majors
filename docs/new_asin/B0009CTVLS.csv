2277771,1,B0009CTVLS,"Life is hard when your biggest decision of the day is deciding whether or not to take Daddy's Beamer or Jag. The dialouge of this show is what you would imagine a conversation between an Abercrombie & Fitch catalog and a J. Crew catalog to be like if instead of models, they were filled with pictures of retarded monkeys.

If you are even able to read the words of this review, then you are already light years more intelligent than the target audience for this show.

Save your $15 bucks, take it to Rodeo Drive, and give it to some 16 year old girl who's out shopping with Mommy's credit card to kick you in the groin as hard as she can and you will get the same effect as watching this sick trash.",1120867200,10,700,4.2164179104477615
2277772,1,B0009CTVLS,"This show is so fake and only shows people what they want to see. Basically a bunch of rich brats running around being bitchy whenever they can. Though entertaining at times, it mostly can be uber annoying.

I myself have family in the posh Laguna Beach and Laguna Hills and NEVER in my life have I run across as bratty a kids as these eight.

Their life is so boring they have to invent DRAMA. And the sad party is...most of us thrive on it.

I reccomend you watch Gilmore Girls. At least you know its not real and you get a laugh out of it. :)",1119312000,18,545,4.074766355140187
2277773,5,B0009CTVLS,"Laguna Beach is a great show to watch while hanging out with your friends or just having some down time on a Saturday afternoon. It is mostly made up of fueds between friends and dramas that occur with regular teenagers around the world. I for one love this show and TiVo it every time it appears on television. I used to think it was just abut some stupid kids running around spending money but when I started to watch it more and more, I got hooked! I can't wait to see the next season! I would definatley recomend this show and would encourage you to buy the DVD set.",1119312000,19,570,4.238532110091743
2277774,5,B0009CTVLS,"i love laguna beach because it isn't ""the o.c."" in that it's actually filmed in orange county, unlike that other show about orange county that is filmed in pales verdes (l.a. county). i live in orange county, so i have been to a lot of the places featured on the show, making lc, lo, talan, and everyone else seem like my friends that i'm hanging out with nearby. my only complaint about this show is the hint of unrealism that is present, as in the second to last episode (when they have a bonfire) they are seen in a gazebo at the beach. i saw them filming that scene as i was camping at that same beach that week, and i knew for a fact that you had to wake up pretty early in the morning to get a hold of that gazebo, unless you're mtv. other than that, i love the show, especially since i really am from the o.c.",1118620800,12,816,4.074534161490683
2277775,4,B0009CTVLS,"I've seen every episode of this show and I think it has its good episodes and bad.  The truth is reality is just not as fun to watch as a scripted show.  I've met one of the cast members for the second season who has been shown in the first.  These people are made out to have super interesting lives, but the truth is they are completely immature high schoolers.  The entire show is run by MTV who tells the kids what to do and what to talk about.  This information comes straight from the cast members.  It goes to show you that reality TV isn't real.  Overall, I give the show a 6/10.",1117324800,13,587,4.0964912280701755

One weekend i got really depresed and watched the entire first season of 'ally mcbeal.'  didn't realize just how depressed i was until i started watching the second season.  yikes.  I had very low expectations for this ('laguna beach') drivel - and i was not disappointed as the show exceeded my expections in the same direction from neutral as my original assessment.",1367452800,,637,4.897196261682243

2278018,5,B0009CTVLS,"As the premier Laguna Beach historian in the NY/NJ metro area, I figured I needed to share my opinions of this fine season.  First, I would like to point out some flaws in the first season: 1) No J-Wahl.  2) No J-Wahl.  3) No J-Wahl.  That is about it.  As we are all aware, Jason Wahler took being an a-hole boyfriend to new heights repeatedly as he made his way through the various ladies of Laguna Beach High School.

Enough about Jason, Season 1 does have Talan Torriero who apparently was a football star in high school.  As shocking as that sounds, I know this information because my 32 year old friend, Seanstradamus Powers, was given&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Laguna-Beach-Life-Inside-the-Bubble/dp/1416520309/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Laguna Beach: Life Inside the Bubble</a>&nbsp;which includes such important information.  Yeah my 32 friend was given a Laguna Beach book as a present, so what?  It is totally normal.  Back when this show was on air, I also tried to match up our vacation schedule with the cast's potential next trip to Cabo.  I don't see a problem with this.

Anyway, highlights of the first season include the classic first episode: ""A Black and White Affair"", the introduction of the word ""Dunzo"" to the english language (When Kristen breaks her car of course), Trey's sweet hats and longboarding, and the great Kristen/Steven fight in Cabo.

Couldn't be a bigger fan of this classic series.",1337472000,3,1471,5.288793103448276
2278019,5,B0009CTVLS,I have wanted to buy Laguna Beach on DVD for a long time now.  I saw this season originally on Netflix and enjoyed it so much.  The discs play through fine without any problems and the episodes are just as great to watch the second time around.  Definitely check it out if you haven't!,1336176000,,285,4.2407407407407405

2278021,2,B0009CTVLS,I was so excited to see the price of this series had dropped. When I received it I watched it and became disappointed. I could not remember this season being so cheesey and boring. I wish I could return it.,1312675200,,206,4.175
2278022,1,B0009CTVLS,I was highly disappointed in this 'purchase.' The wrinkled envelope came in regular mail and there was nothing in the envelope. THe DVD's I thought I bought were missing.,1310428800,,170,4.896551724137931
2278023,5,B0009CTVLS,"I really liked the condition of the DVD's that I received. I was nervous to order used DVD's but definitely worth saving the money. The show was also amazing, my little guilty pleasure.",1274659200,,185,4.636363636363637
2278034,5,B0009CTVLS,"It's like a soap opera, but way more believable. Most things the characters say are completely improvisational and most of their actions are done because they want to do them, not because a script tells them to. Sure scenes are sometimes set up by producers because they're only filming for a few hours a day and everyone has to be interacting with each other during these times, but for the most part it's just genuine reactions. And that makes the show more believable and easy to relate with compared to other soap opera-type shows. These people are exactly how one would expect someone with the mentality of a high school student to be. Their lives are way different than that of most high school students, but that's what keeps the show interesting. And you have to keep in mind, the original idea behind the show is documenting rich high school students to see how money adds to the drama. These guys have hot tubs and go on vacation all the time and get cars/expensive gifts because they're rich. This was always the plan, it's not a secret bias or anything. So all and all I think MTV's done a great job of creating a story out of these eight interconnected lives.",1270857600,,1172,4.559241706161138
2278035,1,B0009CTVLS,"Laguna Beach is a beautiful resort in Southern California. It is known for its gorgeous beaches, interesting art festivals, and clean waters. I've visited it many times ever since I was a little kid, and I'm always struck at how beautiful everything is. Everything except . . . that godawful reality show! Honestly, this is one of the most horrible shows to ever hit the mainstream media. Why? Well, everything is so incredibly uninteresting. It's basically these young girls and boys talking and talking and talking and shopping and talking and talking and doing nothing and shopping and breaking up and making up and going to the beach and talking and . . . that's all they do. Come on! I'm pretty sure that not every teenager that lives in Laguna Beach is like that. They're smarter and more interesting than the ones that are on this show. And why would we be fascinated with Kristin, Jen, and everyone else? They are such a boring group of people! They do nothing productive with their own lives! Why are they doing nothing but lying around and enjoying the sunshine? Why don't we see them work? Don't they have jobs?! Good God, the creator of this show ought to be banned from television!

But I think the worst sin that this show commits is that it assumes that this is ""The Real Orange County."" Bull****! You actually think that this county is full of rich white people? That is false: that's only fifteen percent of the entire population. And believe me when I say that I live in Orange County (I've been living here for about fifteen years). If you go farther up north away from Laguna Beach, you can see that it's ETHNICALLY DIVERSE. Here we have Latinos, Asians, African-Americans, etc. And not only that, we have many different philosophies on life, not to mention our variable political and religious beliefs. Oh, and we work for a living. We don't always lie around the house all the time. Don't get me wrong. I still love the south side of Orange County. Huntington, Newport, and Laguna are fantastic beaches, and the suburbia in Laguna Niguel and Mission Viejo are just beautiful. But why couldn't MTV focus on a city like Garden Grove or Buena Park or Santa Ana? THEY'RE the cities that showcase the Real Orange County. As a matter of fact, I would love to see a show on Fox or NBC that would show just that.

So there you have it. ""Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County,"" in all its boring and inaccurate glory, sucks. It's definitely one of the worst shows of the new millennium. This is one reason why I don't watch Reality TV. God help us all.

Grade: F",1258934400,,2574,4.567099567099567
2278036,5,B0009CTVLS,"Laguna Beach is the show that gave fame to a group of random rich kids from the OC. This show was popular during my junior/senior year in high school, and while I for sure not popular or rich, I did, and do, feel a bit of a bond with this group. It's great fluff and entertaining. I personally like this season much more than the second, though I feel that it is good as well. Season three was garbage and the Laguna spinoff Newport Harbor was ok, definitely better than Laguna season three.

Anyway, back to the product. This is a nice DVD set that features all full episodes and bonus footage and interviews which are pretty interesting. It is worth buying this set if you liked the show back in the day. Believe me, unless you were someone who watched all the episodes ten times each already, you will enjoy your second spin around Laguna and find yourself seeing things that you missed or don't remember from watching the original episodes. The best part is that you can usually find the first and second seasons of Laguna here on Amazon for $5-$10 each, or less, which makes enjoying this series again cheap and easy. Oh, and I'd also recommend buying this to people who are fans of Lauren Conrad and the Hills as you get to see her grow up and evolve into who she is today. If you're a Hills fan and missed Laguna, you'll probably like it as well and it will give you perspective on how Lauren and Heidi grew up.",1235779200,3,1418,4.350943396226415
2278037,5,B0009CTVLS,"I got season 1 and 2 for christmas this year, haven't gotten around to watching 2 yet.
But with season one, it was great to be able to have. I remember watching parts of the show back when I was a freshmen in highschool and being able to watch it again when I can either ""relate"" or find things interseting now.
I also love The Hills so I'm glad I'm able to see where LC came from, and how shes changed.
I was dissappointed thou, while watching season 1 because it comes with three disks, so I firgured three disks full of episodes. nope- theh last disk is just special features, so I was bummed about that thinking there was more than episodes, but its clearly marked on the cd, ""special features""
If you like the show, I find this buy worthwhile.

2278038,5,B0009CTVLS,"I have always enjoyed this series, and have both seasons on DVD, as well as all of The Hills.  The DVD is definitely worth buying if you're into the show.

I recently wrote a paper for a communications class about the show and how it tells us how to behave according to our gender roles.  The show is quite stereotypical, and the cast is full of rich, white, straight, beautiful people.  For some, that is its appeal, along with the pretty scenery.  Surprisingly, I still like the show.  There is something comforting in watching it.  Perhaps it is the knowledge that compared to them I am down-to-earth and not shallow.  I'm still not sure.",1223856000,5,641,4.56140350877193
2278039,4,B0009CTVLS,"Reminisce back to the first season of ""Laguna Beach"", when the O.C. was the hot show and it was way before Heidi and Spencer of ""The Hills"".

  The first season revolves around the love triangle between Lauren ""LC"" (who narrates the first season), Stephen (the guy she likes and had a short fling with) and Kristin (Stephen's girlfriend).  Needless to say, LC and Kristin hate each other's guts.

  The show also features their friends and the teen angst that they are going through.  From high school activities, trying to get grades enough to graduate, preparing for prom, trying to get into college and spring break in Cabo.

  Where most shows have covered the struggles of  teen angst and financial challenges, Laguna Beach: The Real OC gives viewers a different perspective through their lives and what the affluent and popular teens of that city do for fun and how they live their lives.

  As for the DVD, all eleven episodes from the first season is featured.

  The video quality is very good  showcasting the brilliant colors of the shoreline, the surf to sunsets.

  As for audio, audio is in stereo but if there is one major complaint, its that some of the music has been changed for the DVD release.

  One of the highlights of Laguna Beach is the use of current popular music at that time.

  From Yellowcard, Maroon 5 to the Black Eyesd Peas.  The music really enhanced the viewability and fun factor of the show.  Unfortunately, some of the cool songs have been replaced.

  As for special features, although short, this is where the DVD set shines.  Included is a tour of LC's house, Lo showing us her favorite spots in Laguna Beach, casting tapes which provide information on the love triangle.  Behind-the-scenes of the season one finale, deleted scenes (which you get to see) and a really interesting interview on how the individuals felt about the show and about other people on the show.

  Also featured is short featurettes taken from the episodes. Plus seven music videos featuring the indie artists whose music was used on the DVD and VIP membership to MTV.com.

  This DVD set (and even the series) may not be for everyone.  But I enjoyed watching a different perspective of teen angst.  Lush visuals, loads of drama and good music makes Laguna Beach: The Real OC quite enjoyable.",1220400000,3,2308,4.751269035532995

Yesterday I was at the mall going to the (Unspecified phone company) lot to cancel my Vonage service (Vonage... Sucks... A-S-S... DO NOT LISTEN TO WHAT THEY SAY ON TV! I can't begin to describe how horrible Vonage is!), but to get there I had to venture through the worst part of the mall. As I carried the phone bill, I crept past the K-Swiss windows without a peep. I then leaped from fake palm tree to fake palm tree infront of the Abercrombie & Fitch store, which was infested with teen girls and their sell-out boy friends that think wearing pink is ""hot"". I then slid down a railing and fell a couple feet short of the Jamba Juice stand. I picked myself up with my remaining strength and threw the smoke bomb I had in my pocket infront me, thus disappearing from the mindless zombies drinking their elixir with the ever-horrendous Down 4 Life playing in the background.

Squash 'N' Squeak below me speaks only the truth! Listen to him too!

It may be hard for you 3-5 star reviewers to accept the fact but then again you can't handle it anyways. Come to your friggen senses and stop wasting you money on this garbage.

Sure, I was into boys and shopping etc, but I don't remember being so imature or so gossipy and bitchy.  I guess times have changed and girls are more bitchy today.

With Sweet Sixteen and other shows like Rich Girls, MTV flaunts ridiculous materialism, whiny spoiled brats, and self-entitlement when they should be showing good music. In a way, I know there are teens, preteens out there idolizing girls on this show, wanting to be just as catty and petty and superficial like them.

But alas I am here to explain why I continued to watch and begin to fall for the show. I watch shows like Laguna Beach because I can't turn away from a trainwreck.

Call it morbid curiosity or deriving pleasure from watching people make a complete fool of themselves, it really is the same thing. I become absorbed in the petty drama because I'm an American. Don't get self righteous on me, we all follow or keep up with the celebrity gossip. It's entertainment.

Newsflash: If you're offended by this show in any way, then you're taking it MUCH too seriously. Yes, it's about spoiled rich kids and their typical little high school problems which are ultimately insignificant in comparison to all the evil that's going on in the world. And? TV shows don't have to be deep or meaningful to be entertaining (why else would Desperate Housewives be a hit?), and obviously a lot of people find it entertaining or it wouldn't be on the air. In addition, it's not exclusively airhead thirteen year olds who like this show, as a sizeable number of these reviews have proven. What the hell is so wrong with watching a little pure fluff now and then? If everything in the media was required to be solemn, we'd all kill ourselves!

For those of you who don't like this show simply because it doesn't entertain you - fine; I can't hold that against you. But for those of you who are literally bothered by this show even being on the air, do your blood pressure a favor and lighten up already.

They are all crazy rich but its fun to see these youngins mess up and have fun.  I love how crazy mean Kristin is, and how sweet LC is shown. It is realyl kind of like High school, the big group in high school that you always wanted to be part of. The rich beautiful people.  Oh well some of us will never be part of that, but it is fun to watch.  It has good extras like featurettes of LC, Lo, Kristin, and Trey.

I honestly do not have the answer to that, but I do know that I like the show. It was really cool to watch it on MTV (the first season), and I decided to buy the dvd because I liked it. I would have to advice people not to buy it if they do not like the show or have never seen it (try to rent it first or watch it on MTV). Also for the ones who do like the show, you really have to make the decision of whether or not these discs need to be in your dvd collection. It was nice to see the shows again, but there are only 11 of them and trust me they will be on MTV again sometime!!! BUT...then again, now that the second season is on tv, you will mostly see reruns of season 2 rather than season 1. Another thing, the bonus features are kind of crappy especially the music videos!!! Most are of artists and songs I don't remember seeing from the show. The other features are pretty cool, but they aren't the kind you would want to watch over and over.

Nobody is claiming that it's emmy-winnning genius like ER or Seinfeld, or that its scripts keep you on the edge of your seat until the surprise ending.  The simple fact is this - Laguna Beach portrays what most high school students wish they had: good looks, a ton of money, a gorgeous home/city, and a lifestyle filled with seemingly carefree promiscuity and drama, without having to worry about the important things in life.  For those of us who can't wait for every new episode, we know that we're partially just tuning in to the eye candy, but also taking in the interactions that make normal people seem even more normal.

My mistake. It is quite simply one of the best shows in recent memory, a perfect synthesis of traditional nighttime dramas and The Real World. The producers' shooting and editing choices lay down a toe-tapping baseline, and the kids' improvisational riffing on their own lives turns soap opera into some kind of funky, interpersonal jazz. No, there's not much emotional depth there... they're affluent high schoolers, after all. They make a lot of dumb mistakes, never manage to say the thing that most needs saying, and tend toward the shallow end of the passion pool. But they're also quite charming, occasionally hilarious, routinely sexy, and generally likable even in their worst moments. Highly recommended.",1124150400,6,885,5.283687943262412

Oh well, just another vulgar chapter in our bold new American saga of glorifying extreme opulence I suppose.  It's the Reagan years reborn!

Anyways, it's less dramatic than the O.C.! No young gold diggers trying to poison their old husbands, or guys sailing off to Tahati (really Oregan).

Lo is cute as LC's best friend and Trey is deep but quiet. The others are not that important. They fill the gaps between the leads scenes.

Also, conversation between teenaged girls is the absolute epitome of banality, particularly stupid ones, like the ones featured on this show.  The show has a few good points, however.  Many of the people have hilarious names (Lo, Talan etc.)  Also, they tend to wear moronic looking sunglasses, which are pretty funny to look at.

The problems were supposedly real, and mimic those that most of us probably encountered in high school. However, it was irritating when Stephen repeatedly went back to Kristen after she would undoubtedly cheat on him - or worse, when she accused him of being unfaithful when she herself had been equally dishonest. Surely nobody in this world lacks as much common sense as this (studly) boy. Had Kristen not been in the series, the show would have been much more bearable to watch. But on the other hand, without her Laguna Beach would lack all the drama and intrigue that makes it such a prime target for high-schoolers and above.

Therefore, stick to watching the reruns on television (they play often) and be prepared for a season two flop, because Kristen is running the show this time around.",1122249600,5,995,4.852941176470588

I liked the series, although I wouldn't consider it unscripted reality tv.  It's similar to '90210' and 'The OC'.  It's mindlessly entertaining.  It's how I imagined rich SoCal teenagers would handle the high school dramas we all experienced in some form.  I think it's unfair to label these kids as rich spoiled brats, etc.  They're product of their environment, as we all are.  And they could be alot worse!  Most of the deleted scences are utterly boring, but there are a few that answer some lingering questions (such as:  If Morgan got rejected by the only college she applied to, where was she packing up to go to when the others were packing for college?).  LC's house tour was the only interesting featurette, and I was intrieged by the Season 2 sneak peek.

The only problem I have with this set, is that MTV made a bunch of music changes. Some songs that were used in the original broadcasting of the show have been replaced, and in my opinion, the changes stuck out like a sore thumb. If you watched all the reruns, and are enough of a fan to buy the set, I'm sure you'll notice them too. Personally, I can't stand when the original music of episode has been altered. But what really annoys me, is that MTV didn't even put a warning anywhere on the box. ""Features brand new music,"" would have been a nice warning to those willing to fork out $30 for their set, but apparently they kept it a close guarded secret. At least with ""Dawson's Creek,"" ( original music was also changed for the dvd ) they let the consumers know about it. Bad move MTV.",1121904000,16,1045,4.225

2278219,4,B0009CTVLS,"This set offers a great deal of extras. It includes about 30 deleted scenes - some hilarious scenes with LC and Lo, which should have been aired in place of those nauseating scenes of Kristin and anyone she was talking to (or making out with).

It has interviews with all the cast and asks some pretty good questions. There were a couple of questions that should have been asked that weren't. Examples include asking LC how she felt when Stephen mouthed 'I love you' to Kristin right before he took her up to his room in Cabo or asking Kristin how she felt when Stephen met LC at the airport in San Fran. I'm sure the reason these question weren't asked is because the interviews were filmed after the show was wrapped, but before it aired.

We are taken on a 'cribs' style tour of LC's incredible new house and Lo takes us on a tour of Laguna. We are shown some footage from the casting tapes. While Trey, Talon, & Morgan are featured more in the extras than they were on the show, great kids like Dieter and Jessica are barely mentioned. I think Talon talked more on the extras than he did on the entire season.

As for the shows, the picture and sound is pretty good. I give the set four stars because a lot of the original music from the show is not on this set. Why MTV couldn't shell out some bucks to do this is beyond me. You'll notice some songs did stay, like '100 years', but the replacement music mostly sucks.

Laguna Beach is a great show. Although I'm looking forward to catching up with some of the cast in season 2, I'm leary because I don't know how much of 'cotton mouth' Kristin I can stomach.

You can't judge someone until you've walked in their shoes. yes Laguna Beach may be all rich people and everyone may think that they're stuck up, but in all reality, they're just normal people living normal lives. They're all trying to get through high school and now some of them college. You can't judge someone just because they seem some way. MTV takes a lot of things out and revises stuff and adds stuff to make it seem like they're all rich and stuck up and they're not. MTV probably added stuff in there to make it seem that way. If MTV went to some poor country and filmed stuff like that, everyone would be like ""oh they're poor and im not going to watch it because of it"". And that's what people are saying about Laguna Beach. ""Oh they're rich and stuck up so im not going to watch it"".

2278234,5,B0009CTVLS,"Honestly, I am appalled by the amount of negative comments viewers of this show have been given. Since when does watching a tv show immediately label you as a shallow, artificial person. Is it so wrong to enjoy a brief half an hour of relief from the stress of daily life. What shocks me the most is that by enjoying this show somehow makes us clueless and unaware of current events. I am very aware about current events in our country, such as the realistic threat of Al Quaida who is sitting happily in Afghanistan while the United States sends more and more soldiers into Iraq, spending money which only adds to the growing deficit in the country, the largest ever in American History. Thereby causing the other countries to hate us, and leaving America defenseless against the real enemy that attacked us on 9-11.

I like this show, and I hardly understand how I can be called vapid or shallow for enjoying a show about teenagers going through the same situations and drama that we all face in our pre-adult years. Negative reviewers say that this show is a bunch of ""stuck up rich kids"". True they are living in one of the most beautiful places on Earth, in what some of us would call lives of luxury. But each of them is still a person regardless of their social status and financial well being. A person going through the same problems and issues as us. So before you go out and judge those of us who like this show, I suggest you take a deeper look at yourself. You may figure out that we're not the real shallow, artificial people.

So to all of you who have been brainwashed into thinking of yourself as not being a decent person just because you enjoy this show, it's time to understand that we all have the right to like what we like and dislike what we don't like. There is nothing wrong with liking this show, and watching it does not mean that you are shallow or not conscious of worldly affairs or any of the things screamed out by other reviewers. These are people who use insults merely because they have no stronger argument to offer. So do yourselves a favor and stop caring. If you like the show, buy it, and if you don't, then don't buy it.

MTV is known for its music related and reality shows, but sometimes they try too hard to get all sorts of wild and tacky things on the air. Every season you see new shows come and go, but Laguna hopefully is here to stay. They really hit the jack pot with this. MTV needed a dramatic soap opera to keep some of their audience interested. The only other teen soap I can think of is Undressed, but we all saw that fail. I love Laguna Beach. At first I wasn't too open to it because I thought the last thing we needed are some more conceited rich kids on tv. But after watching the first show I was just hooked. Its so stylish and the settings are beautiful, in a way it  makes you envious! There's so much drama that the typical teenager in high school can relate to and I think thats what makes it great. That despite their image of worry free lives, they actually suffer the same problems that any teen would growing up or in a relationship. Its mainly about love triangles, going away to college and talking behing eachothers backs... but its great. I cant stress it enough. Now MTV has so many reality shows but most of them seemed staged to me. Pimp my ride, room raiders, date my mom, Made and a few more all seem so fake. They all seem like they've been practicing their lines yet they still suck at it. But I dunno for some reason Laguna seems real. And thats what makes it so believable...

2278238,5,B0009CTVLS,"This cast and stories, of course are a little over the top, but what wrong with that? I found the seriers to be funny and enjoyable. Once you start watching it, you don't want to stop because the ""high school drama"" (that we were all once apart of) just sucks you in- except this time you aren't exactly a part of it. Which is exactly what makes this show such a quilty pleasure.",1121126400,11,379,4.205479452054795
2278239,1,B0009CTVLS,"Why are Americans so obsessed with rich, spolied brats when there are so many problems in this country? That joke of a war, increasing job losses, middle class poverty levels, etc but all people want is trash like this and Paris Hilton and her gang of morons.

This is not the real O.C.! Maybe because I spent a few years living in SoCal, but all I ever saw of The O.C. was traffic, construction and that rip-off known as Disneyland. The O.C. is literally a wasteland of Republicans and people who are too poor to make it in the Hills or Long Beach.",1121126400,12,549,4.330097087378641

8059092,4,B0009CTVLS,I love this show! I'm 29 now but enjoy watching this show still ever since it was aired when I was in high school. I wasn't the popular or rich girl in school so it was nice to see how that side lives. The school I went to had cliques like on this show as I lived in suburban Chicago and the girls talked and acted like the ones on the show. Every once in a while I get nostalgia and watch this show and think back to my high school days. Season 2 is better though. There's more episodes and more drama mostly caused by Jason lol. Season 3 isn't quite the same since its all new characters other than Jessica but Cameron is pretty cute. Hes like the new Jason basically. Kyndra is the most bitchy though I'd say of all the girls.,1507334400,,729,4.0344827586206895
