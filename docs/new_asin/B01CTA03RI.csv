8754154,5,B01CTA03RI,This film provides insightful and excellent coverage of a dramatic period in women's history and poignant and funny reflections by those who were at the core of changes for women during the late 1960's. Definitely not to be missed.,1490486400,2,231,4.948717948717949
8754155,5,B01CTA03RI,"You don't have to have been a member of Skidmore's class of 1969 to appreciate this reflective, thought-provoking film. In using their unusual yearbook (or yearbox, in this case) photo shoot as a jumping-off point, we listen as these women look back on life from age 65: the enormous social changes that occurred during their college years, the struggles & joys & often unanticipated choices that followed over the decades, and their musing over what their legacy will be.

What makes this film fascinating to any thinking & feeling viewer is threefold, it seems to me. First, as the memory of a specific, turbulent time in American history, and how it affected (and was affected by) young women becoming aware of their true potential. This is feminism as complexity, not caricature. Second, as an examination of the many paths taken by distinct individuals, and what each one gained or lost (usually both) along the way. And third, because all of us will be older at some point -- I'm just about the age of these women myself now -- and at this period of life, reflection & re-assessment become more important, as we attempt to makes sense of the past while facing the future.

Which isn't to say that this is simply a summing up at the end! No, these women clearly have more life & living in them, and more possibilities that are still unexplored. That message in itself makes the film worth seeing, and more than once -- I've ordered the DVD so I can watch it again from time to time in the years to come. Society's desperate obsession with youth (or the appearance of youth) has all too often muted & dismissed the voices of older people, as if they no longer had anything to contribute to the world. Listening to these women discuss their complex lives & what they've learned from living puts the lie to that simplistic notion -- most highly recommended!",1490227200,3,1859,4.664634146341464
8754156,5,B01CTA03RI,We watched it twice.  If you're into big history seen through small stories and an up close and personal look at women's recent struggles for equality this is must see.,1485734400,,168,4.6
8754157,5,B01CTA03RI,It was terrific to see the Skidmore women exerting their independence.  I have often wished I attended a women's college instead of a large co-ed university.,1481414400,4,157,5.038461538461538
8754158,5,B01CTA03RI,"Very interesting and wonderfully done piece about my era in college.....I was a year behind these women at Skidmore and feel that this captured very well the times and goings on during those few years when things changed so drastically for us women at a womens' college.  I do remember the year book in a box but really didn't think much about it.....just typical for the changing times...hey, yes, a year book in a box, why not, and no parietals, birth control and drugs readily available, and men staying overnight.  My first year in 1966 two boys sneaked  into our dorm room and my roommates and I had to go before the Academic Integrity Council, or some such group, to plead for forgiveness for the mens' actions!!  By senior year, I think some boys were living in our dorms!

Great film...thanks to all of you who put it together, many of whom I remember!",1470700800,2,860,4.558441558441558
