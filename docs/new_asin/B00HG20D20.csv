8632601,1,B00HG20D20,"The information given on this dvd is just tadbits of what's given on another set sold by amazon.  In fact, it's part 1, of 1 of 3 dvd's sold under the name of: Kyokushin Karate Training Martial Arts DVD (a 3 dvd set) sold by amazon which I have.  The latter is a decent set.  This Kyokushin Encyclopedia is almost like a infomercial on the latter.  Very sad and misleading.  The description given, if read closely actually refers to the style ""Kyokushin"" NOT what's on the dvd.  Misleading, very short, and very little info on this dvd!",1390348800,,536,4.474226804123711
