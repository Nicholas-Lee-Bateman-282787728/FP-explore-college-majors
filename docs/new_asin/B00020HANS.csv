8019606,5,B00020HANS,"This film is AWESOME. I watched it on Nexflix, had nothing to do one night so I watched this on my puter. And let me tell you people. This movie is really worth the reading of subtitles. I'm not going to give any of the plot away. I will just say that it's an well made movie.",1261353600,2,276,3.8596491228070176
8019607,4,B00020HANS,"I watched this film a long time ago on tv and it still has this weird impact on me. So, i decided to purchase and i am still not dissappointed! A fresh take and undoubtly, one of the finest interpretations from this filmaker from Spain.
 If you enjoy foreign films, please do give this a chance. Recommended!",1225843200,,308,4.4035087719298245
8019608,5,B00020HANS,"Dr. Fausto, a surgeon who deals with terminally ill cases, is on his way to a medical convention where he is due to present a paper. On the way he is accosted by the devilish looking Santos Vela, a man who claims the doctor operated on him years ago. This is not a chance encounter. ""Vela"" follows the good doctor about, offering him happiness and the fulfillment of all his wishes, good and bad. And in spite of himself, Dr. Fausto succumbs.

Of course, getting your wishes fulfilled isn't always a good thing. Pretty soon, Fausto realizes he is in over his head. Things are getting--to say the least--creepy. How will he ever get out? How will he ever get rid of the Mephistophelean Santos Vela? Or, will he?

Thankfully, redemption is possible, and comes in a surprising but satisfying way--which, of course, I won't share with you. You'll have to watch this movie for yourself. I picked up the film to help with my Spanish, was thoroughly enchanted by it, watched it twice and loved it. Beautifully done, with great photography, sound, symbolism, over-the-top fantasies, and--of course--the unnaturally cheerful demon who is Santos Vela.

I recommend this one highly. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber.",1132358400,13,1200,4.84390243902439
8019609,4,B00020HANS,"A very unusual film. The cinematography, sets, characters and story are all very different.
The story revolves around Dr. Fausto (a venerated doctor dealing in terminal medicine) and one of his past patients called Salles. Salles is an eccentric character, the kind of person who can get under your skin with his attitude and behavior. Salles is a demi genie and he helps (otherwise a very uptight and reserved) Dr. Fausto unveil his dark and hedonistic side. Salles encourages Fausto to be forceful with his wishes. Dr. Fausto had operated on a terminally ill Salles many years back (and allegedly removed his stomach). Salles recovered miraculously (because of wishful thinking) and maintained a grudge against Dr. Fausto for removing his stomach. His character is intriguing and you'll be confused if he is thankful or vengeful.

The transformation in Dr. Fausto's character is sudden and scary. The intriguing and somewhat confusing story is supplemented by dark ambient music, draped sets and psychedelic lighting. The end is sudden and will keep you guessing.",1118880000,8,1065,5.228070175438597
8019610,4,B00020HANS,"This is a very odd, compelling retelling of the Faust legend set in contemporary Spain.  The performances and visuals are excellent but it took me a little while to settle into the film and go along for the ride.  It's not slow, but if you're expecting a fast-paced, emotionally satisfying entertainment then this is deifintely not for you.  However, if you like your cinema somewhat challenging, ambiguous and little frightening then you'll find it quite worthwhile.",1098057600,8,467,5.118421052631579
