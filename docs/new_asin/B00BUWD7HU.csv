8574260,3,B00BUWD7HU,Enjoyed both movies as I am a huge fan of van damme! Only problem with this set is that both movies are on 1 disc therefore the quality is minimal at best. I often find that when old movies are transfered onto bluray disc in pairs they make less of an effort in enhancing the quality of the movie to actual bluray which in my opinion is disappointing. I gave this set to a friend as a gift and purchased movies separately and the difference in sound and quality is unbelievable!,1437436800,,478,4.263736263736264
