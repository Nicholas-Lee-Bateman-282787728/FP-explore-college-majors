There may be pain, sorrow, regrets, hurtful baggage, etc., but many of us continue to try and restore ourselves and such relationships to a more positive equilibrium well into adulthood. (For me, it's been a life-long quest.) Sort of like Evie is trying to do in her search for the geodetic center of the United States; sort of like Tara is trying to do with this film, which I see as an attempt to analyze and repair her relationship with Evie.

If ""Leave it to Beaver"" type families scare the crap out of you because of their sheer, terrifying, ""Twilight Zone"" normalcy, why not watch ""Manhattan Kansas"" and see if it doesn't remind you of someone; maybe yourself, maybe a family member (or two).

Miscellaneous observations: Tara owes a lot to her intelligent, well-read, pretty deep-thinking mom. Unlike hippie-chick mom Evie, however, Gen-X daughter Tara has found a way to channel all that creative energy in a hopefully more productive, lucrative manner. Note to all the free-spirits out there: Money might not buy happiness, but the lack of money pretty much guarantees...problems. And more responsible family members worrying about you endlessly.

There is a special surprise ending that I won't give away here. But it's well worth the price of this DVD. This movie is worth watching over and over and over. Five stars.",1323561600,,1458,4.890688259109312
