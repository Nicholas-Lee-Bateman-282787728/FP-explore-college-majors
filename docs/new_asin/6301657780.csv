346629,5,6301657780,"Boy, did this DVD bring back loads of memories of being a child and running home from school to watch Felix The Cat cartoons. Unfortunately, this DVD only has 11 chapters (1 is a secret chapter you see after you play the trivia game) out of 121 chapters. We need more Felix The Cat chapters on DVD. I hope that there is more to come.",1127952000,11,333,4.138461538461539
346630,5,6301657780,For cartoon fanatics over the age of 35 who remember sitting un front of the television on Saturday mornings in pajamas eating cereal. Each cartoon is a short but welcome break from reality and something to share with your own kids with having to censor it first. A Must buy for Felix lovers everywhere.,1124236800,8,303,4.62962962962963
346631,5,6301657780,"I vaguely remembered Felix the cat from when i was growing up and decided to give this DVD along with ""The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat"" a try.  I watched this one completely last night and I loved it.  All of the episodes were funny and entertaining.  I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of cartoons of this era.",1097107200,9,325,4.126984126984127
346632,4,6301657780,"The first in the series. Very nicely restored. If you like Felix, this is a must. If you are curious, rent it first.",1059696000,13,116,4.086956521739131
346633,4,6301657780,"Anyone that watched Felix the Cat on a daily basis as I did in the '60s will undoubtedly enjoy the sheer nostalgia of these cartoons.  Having not seen Felix in many years, I was amazed at how familiar the episodes were.  In fact, I found myself remembering the dialogue!  As strange as the current ""new wave"" of cartoons may be, it's hard to duplicate the surrealistic quality that dominates the world of Felix, Poindexter, The Master Cylinder etc.  The transfer on these cartoons, while not perfect, is certainly acceptable and no doubt superior to the scratchy films that have been shown on TV over the years.  The episodes themselves are well chosen, although I was a bit dissapointed at the absence of the cartoon featuring ""Big Brownie"".  Any chance of sequels to this disk?  I'm not aware of how many cartoons were created, but I'm sure there are more than enough to fill another disk or two.  My kids are hooked, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this disk to anyone with fond memories of Felix and his strange adventures.",1001894400,19,1032,4.694444444444445
346634,4,6301657780,"Finally, the Felix cartoons from the fabulous 50s on DVD! There are 10 episodes on this DVD (which seem to have been culled from other sources) and they're a pretty good mix. There's the Professor, Rock Bottom, Poindexter, and the Master Cylinder (who was human once until he blew himself up - never knew that), but I wish they had included VaVoom! The production quality is very good, although the episode numbering is strange - as I said before they probably pulled these from VHS. There are episodes that number in the 20s yet there are only ten on the disc (with an 11th shown only if you get 8 or more trivia questions right)! In spite of some production issues, if you're a kid of the 60s that watched Felix along with Underdog, Gigantor, Speed Racer, Bullwinkle et al, pick this one up. Hopefully there will be more!!",997315200,9,824,4.5369127516778525

7814143,2,6301657780,"I was anxious to get this one when it first came out.
I spent almost 15 dollars at that time to order it by mail.
But i was really disappointed.
Sure it was Felix from the 50s.
But the original title sequence had been replaced by some generic junky looking title, and then an sloppy cut to the original cartoon.
So, I see you can pick it up for cheap now.
And if you're not too picky, then go ahead.
But you were warned!",1304899200,,420,4.011904761904762
7814144,5,6301657780,"This cartoon program was made in an era where every cartoon show was pain stakingly drawn and painted by hand, along with long and slow camera work was the only way to produce a cartoon series.
I remember running down the street to a friend's house in the afternoon and tuning in to her early cable just to get a glimps of Felix the Cat.
Back then it was like an old time serial with a continuing episode each day, and ended in a clif hanger every day. If I missed one episode I'd miss seeing how Felix got out of another peril The Professor and his nephew, Poindexter, put him into.
Luckily for me, and for all those who grew up watching Felix and his black and yellow bag of tricks, the whole serial of Felix the Cat in Gold, Gold is available on one vhs video. Yes, the color is a bit faded and the script seems a bit hokey now, but back in the early 1960's Felix was tops in afternoon cartoons.
Gold, Gold puts Felix in more odd fixes, yet without his magic bag of tricks to get him out of trouble.
The Professor and Poindexter are fast on Felix,s heels through out this serial.
So, get out your vcr, grab a box of animal crackers and your favorite pop, and push in Gold, Gold with Felix the Cat and get ready for a fun time.
Righty O!!",1293840000,,1240,4.128099173553719
7814145,3,6301657780,"I wanted this disk because when I was in 6th grade I had a VHS of Felix cartoons (from Goodtimes Video) which I watched over and over until they became burned into my consciousness.  It's been over 20 years since I have seen the three Van Beuren Rainbow Parade cartoons featuring Felix.  Apparently there were only three of them ever made, and all three are on this disk.  The old VHS also contained at least two of the Pat Sullivan 1930 pseudo-sound Felix cartoons released through Copeley Pictures.  Sadly, those are not on this disk.  The playlist is as follows:

1.  Bold King Cole, directed by Burt Gillett and Otto Messmer (the genius director of all the silent-era Felix cartoons)
2.  The Goose that Laid the Golden Egg
3.  Neptune Nonsense (features one of Winston Sharples' all-time best musical scores)
The rest of the disk is non-Felix filler:
4.  Base Brawl, a follow-the-bouncing-ball sing-along cartoon featuring the song ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game.""  Worth seeing if you've never been exposed to this odd social phenomenon from pre-television America.  If you have seen follow-the-bouncing-ball cartoons before, you will groan at the prospect of watching another one.
5.  Jerky Turkey, a surprisingly UNfunny Thanksgiving cartoon directed by Tex Avery.
6.  Jack Frost, a late Ub Iwerks cartoon; one which I hadn't seen before.
7.  Tom Thumb, another Iwerks which is included in almost every cartoon collection.
8.  The Mild West, another bouncing ball sing-along.
9.  The Cobweb Hotel, one of the weirder productions from the Fleischer studios.
10.  Molly Moo-Cow and Robinson Crusoe, another Rainbow Parade cartoon featuring a simple-minded cow and a grouchy hermit.  Has an astounding racist punchline at the end.

The picture quality is remarkably good, except for ""Cobweb Hotel"" which is washed-out and blurry, as if it was transferred from a 3rd or 4th generation film print.  I have seen better transfers of it ... but the rest of the cartoons on this disk look great.  The opening title of each cartoon is matted in a color frame, making it smaller than the screen.  I don't understand the purpose of this.  The frame zooms out after the credits, and each cartoon is presented full-screen.

Here's a very important feature which they neglect to mention in the promotional blurb:  These cartoons have ""enhanced sound"" which means some audio engineer has monkeyed with the soundtrack in attempt perhaps to clean it up or make it sound a little newer.  This in itself wouldn't be bad, but they have added sound effects.  The new sound effects are in stereo and are ungracefully dubbed in on top of the original monaurial soundtrack.  In an effort to make them blend better, a short delay has been applied to the original track to make it sound ""fuller.""  The actual result is that it just sounds tinny and ""hollow"" like it's playing inside a coffee can.  The added sound effects are louder and more distinct than the original soundtrack.  They OBVIOUSLY don't match and do not belong in these cartoons.  I found them to be very distracting.  I remember those Felix cartoons from my childhood, and the sound was so integral to the experience (everything is timed to music in these cartoons) it seems almost insulting to hear them after they've been tampered with.  Maybe if you've never seen these cartoons and you don't know what they are supposed to sound like, you won't be bothered by the change, but it severely diminished my enjoyment of the cartoons ... and I'm taking away a star because of it.",1265241600,3,3523,4.863865546218487
7814146,4,6301657780,"I think some of the disappointment over this DVD has to do with the ""collector's edition"" subtitle.  Given the number of episodes and the lack of the ""best"" Felix episodes, it is probably not for the Felix connesseur.  But for those of us who just want their first plunge back into their childhood classics and/or to introduce their youngsters to the toons ""back in our day"", it is just fine.  It is a good sampling of Felix episodes and my 5 year old (now 7) was immediately hooked.  Just goes to show that you don't need sarcastic supergirls (powerpuffs) or amazing computer graphics to make really top notch kids entertainment.",1197849600,,630,4.7
7814147,4,6301657780,very enjoyable cartoon. expected it to have more shows on it. will keep in my collection.,1175385600,,89,4.625
7814148,4,6301657780,Video quality is fine...I was a little dissapointed as it is still the 'old' vintage Felix..I am still looking for Felix the Cat as seen on TV in the 60's...,1168300800,9,157,4.266666666666667
7814149,4,6301657780,"This DVD contains 10 unedited full-color episodes from the 1958-59 season of the TV show. Early children's TV shows were usually live shows such as ""Howdy Doody"", because animation was expensive. Cartoons on TV were usually those originally shown at the theatre such as Looney Tunes. This is one of the first cartoons made for TV, although Felix had been around since 1919 in various forms.

Considering that this is vintage animation for television, the picture is a bit softer than what one would find in theatrical cartoons of the same period. Colors generally have a dusty pastel quality, but otherwise look pretty good. The contrast is good, and the Dolby Digital monaural soundtrack is crisp and free from noise or distortion. Dialogue is always completely intelligible. The fidelity is rather limited, with music and sound effects sometimes coming off a bit harsh.

As for extras, the 1920 short film ""Feline Follies"", which was Felix's unofficial film debut, is included on the DVD. A ""Felix the Cat Through the Ages"" interview with author John Canemaker offers a concise history of the character and his creators through various incarnations. An original Felix the Cat Promo Reel offers clips used to promote the TV show in various languages. A Felix the Cat Sing-A-Long provides the kiddies a chance to follow a bouncing ball and sing the show's theme song. A trivia game has also been included on the DVD.",1167609600,8,1416,4.970464135021097
