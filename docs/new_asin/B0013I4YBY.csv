8251052,2,B0013I4YBY,"This is a radio interview with Nick Pope, minus the interviewer's questions, set to a series of about a dozen still photos of airborne anomalies that keep cycling through. Certainly not much to look at. The interview content was okay, and the only reason I rated it so highly. You are better off logging onto You Tube - they've got better videos for free. Full marks to Mayan Animations, though, for publishing credible UFO material.",1359331200,,433,4.786666666666667
8251053,5,B0013I4YBY,"In the 1990's Nick Pope investigated UFO reports for England's Ministry of Defence.
He went from sceptic to believer from the abundance of official evidence and reports he was able to collect.
 What he learned has changed his life forever!
Is there a certain blood type that report more ufo abductions than others?
Are Special Forces Units being deployed on covert surveillance of the properties of those who have seen a UFO?
Are UFO witnesses being targeted as a national security risk?
Is the infamous flying triangle harassing military bases?
Nick Pope stands alone as the sole official who has come to grips and offers help, when no one else will !",1223164800,,652,4.821428571428571
