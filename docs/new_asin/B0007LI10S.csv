2217613,1,B0007LI10S,"Amazon is quite gracious in allowing reviewers the chance to rate the worst movies with only 1 star.  I have to say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  I must disagree with my other reviewers and state that if this is Rolfie boy's feminine side, I wish he wouldn't have found it in the first place.

Actually, this movie is a feminist fantasy wrapped up in a pseudo-intellectual skirt posing as a commentary on contemporary relationships.  If Rolf wants to make porno, he should just make porno and not call it art! Also, he should not be preaching to us about how bad men are, enough already!

The main character is a shallow, sad excuse for a woman and a mother.  Whatever happened to talking to your partner and telling them, 'I'm not happy and what are we going to do about it?' But NOOOO!  Ms. Alexandra has to become a hooker to get back at the man who she said, ""Married my body.""  And what did she marry? Is her husband fat, ugly, an ogre, does he look like Shrek on crack? Quite the opposite, he is a normal guy - just like 75% of the men out there, he's nothing special.

Overall, Rolf de Heer must have been drunk when he made this piece of fetid tripe. If you like man-hating movies get it, if you want social commentary and entertainment, look elsewhere.",1141430400,16,1285,4.320833333333334
2217614,4,B0007LI10S,"A very interesting movie, although difficult to watch.  It really rings home, posing the question  . . . how much do you really know about those closest to you.  And how are you actions perceived by them, relative to the innocent or innocuous manner in which they may have been intended.

Apparently the minutiae of his life were subjected to the most detailed scrutiny by his wife, and she didn't like what she found.  Some of what he did may have been beyond the pale, but apparently he did nothing knowingly to harm her or their children.

Was there really enough of a reason  for her to do what she did or was she over-reacting.  Was there something else she could have done, perhaps earlier in their marriage, that would give him the opportunity to respond in a meaningful way?  One could not but blame her, perhaps more than him, for what happened.  Did she ever really love him?

It demonstrates, in the extreme, the characteristic some husbands assign to their wives  . . . her being angry but not telling him why she is angry  . . .",1125187200,5,1041,4.444444444444445
2217615,5,B0007LI10S,"This film will definitely not appeal to everyone.  It is emotionally and sexually brutal, and the weak of heart or stomach should stick to Hillary Duff flicks, or perhaps a good clean slasher film.  When I saw a 'sneak preview' a few days ago, not one walked out during the film but there was a stunned and silent exodus after.  The closest I can come to its raw impact are Peter Greenaway films such as ""The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover"", though ""Alexandra's Project"" is simpler and more personal.  It compels you to watch even as it makes it uncomfortable to do so.

The film starts out easily, though with some forebodings of camera angle and incident.  Steve (Gary Sweet) wakes up in an Australian suburb on his birthday; his charming children give him some presents, and his wife Alexandra (Helen Buday) tells him that a surprise will be waiting him when he comes home. It seems an idyllic scene, but ....  When Alexandra wants to pay a bill, Steve forcefully reminds her the accounts are his ...  their row house has been fitted with deadbolt locks and automated security shutters (doubly jarring in free and open Australia) ... Steve curses a sinister neighbor out watering the communal lawn.  At work, Steve is called into the boardroom ... sweatingly unsure if he is to be fired or promoted (perhaps, we think, his controlling nature at home stems from lack of control at work?).  But it is good news, and he goes home ready to celebrate ...

... only to find an empty, dark and shuttered house, the light bulbs removed and a video tape on the TV saying ""watch me"".  Pretty creepy, but when he puts it in it's a birthday present -- Alexandra informing him the children are staying with a relative and then doing an amateurish striptease for the camera as Steve has a beer (at the tape's suggestion) and enthusiastically watches.  Then she stops, not quite naked, and sits down to vent her anger and frustration at her life and him.  When he tries to escape, he finds he is cleverly locked in by all those security devices, and he is forced to continue, gradually becoming drunker, distress playing on his face.

It would be too much of a spoiler to describe what happens next, but there are several surprises as the tension builds and a sad and enigmatic ending.  It becomes over the top at times, but in a way that is the point.  We don't know if Alexandra is being logical and rational, reacting to a desperate situation, or overreacting out of dementia or paranoia.

Buday's is a bravura performance, as she chews up the scenery and convincingly plays a woman who is (justifiably or not) not about to take it any more.  Sweet's performance is less overtly dramatic, but excellent in the play of emotion on his face as he gradually dissolves in pity and horror. Both actors take great risks.  It is remarkable that each is alone, Buday/Alexandra speaking to camera while Sweet/Steve must act passively and receptively.

Women in the audience will undoubtedly sympathize with Alexandra's grievances and frustrations, while men will likely see her taped monologue as a metaphor for women's desire to have the men in their lives as mute objects, receiving an angry harangue without rebuttal.  Many will be disgusted or horrified, but few will be left unaffected.",1123113600,6,3281,4.699300699300699
2217616,5,B0007LI10S,"The movie stars out slow. Alexandra wakes up, washes her face, saying sorry to her husband Steve, then spits on the mirror because she feels that she doesn't have to be sorry. She sends him off to work and tells the kids that they aren't going to school because they are going to decorate the room for their dad's birthday. She films all of them saying ""Happy Birthday"" and toasting their father, then sends them off in a taxi.

At this point, you are wondering what's going on, and the suspense was definitely killing me! When Steve comes home, it is dark, the living room furniture is piled up, and there is a chair in the middle of the room. There is also a videotape that says, ""Play me."" Alexandra comes on and even though the tape starts out promising for Steve, it ends very badly for him. Unlike the previous reviewer, I do not give out spoilers, so hopefully you will get to this review first. Knowing what will happen from now on will ruin the movie for you.

The moral of this story is: Treat your significant other with respect and kindness, especially if they are the type of person that may snap and take revenge. Revenge was definitely sweet for Alexandra.",1111276800,6,1171,4.4672897196261685
2217617,4,B0007LI10S,"I viewed this movie at the Regal Arbor in north Austin, TX during South by Southwest.  I arrived 45 minutes early thinking that I would beat the crowd at the door.  Come to find out I was the only one in the theatre for a half hour.  Pretty funny.  This movie was really the first foreign film I had ever really seen in theatres.  The story was excellent and original of any other film I can think of.  My only beef with the film is that it went on a bit long, however, using that time makes you feel the distraught that this father is feeling.

  A man comes home from work to an empty house with birthday decorations up everywhere.  There is a tv set up with a videotape ready to be played.  He gets a beer, puts in the tape and it is his wife and two children wishing him a happy birthday.  The two kids exit the room at the request of their mother, and the mother, Alexandra, starts a striptease for her husband.  As the tape goes on, his wife gets more and more cynical, and the dread gets thicker.  You cannot help but feel sorrow for this poor man.  As the movie draws to a close, it may be impossible to comprehend the type of sabotage commited by this woman.  Shock and awe!  Terrible what this man must now endure.
  Anyone who has read my past unedited review of this movie might remember some spoilers.  Well, I only edited the past review to appease the bookworm above me.  Obviously she doesn't understand that if people don't like spoilers, or if they think they could currently be reading one, they can.....I don't know.....not read it.  Me myself, need to read spoilers because the suspense kills me.
  Anyway, this movie is completely edible and quaffable; because when it's over, you will eat and drink this mans's sorrow for breakfast, lunch and dinner.",1106784000,2,1773,4.384615384615385

2217619,3,B0007LI10S,"It is worth seeing, but is disturbing.  The juxtaposition of the genuine emotional performance of the actor playing the husband to the cruelty of the actress playing the wife makes you question your own relationships.  The woman has a complete misunderstanding of a man's attitude in a committed, loving male/female relationship - her attitudes sound like an anti-male rant inserted.  The performances were very good - both main characters did an excellent job.  The plot became thin at the end of the movie when several consequences of what had occurred couldn't be resolved in a convenient way.",1485820800,5,596,5.11340206185567
2217620,1,B0007LI10S,"This film is highly reviewed critically, but it utterly creeped us out. If you're the type of person who can watch a film with a thread of a plot and find it challenging to try to figure out what it is trying to say (or perhaps, what it's trying make you think about what it's trying to make you think it's trying to  say), you may like this. But the material -- a woman's anger at her husband's obliviousness as to her richness as a person -- amounts to one long, unpleasant decline into the ugly side of their marital relations.

Either way, the theme is certainly there and is credible in and of itself, notwithstanding the fictionalized events. The story itself is creative, with sufficient twists and turns to hold your attention yet stop WAY short of the impossibilities of much modern fiction, especially in movies. This story could actually have happened, pretty much. if you like social-comment flicks and won't react poorly to a woman who reaches her breaking point (or maybe if you will), this one is worth a look.",1475539200,,751,5.1138211382113825

The two main characters did not understand each other's styles and that lead to both becoming deplorable. However, there is no ""balance"" with the characters; we are given a premise where we are told to sympathize with the wife - yet despite (not excusing) the husband's past transgressions she doesn't come across as anything other than cruel. If their relationship was so bad then she should have left long ago.

2217648,4,B0007LI10S,"Alexandra's Project is a very psychological projection from the wife of a controlling husband to him thru a video tape left in their home.  Out of all the days to pick to do this project, it had to be on the husband's birthday.  There are a number of metaphors in this film that help to explain the feelings of the wife to the audience (it should have been for the husband but he's very clueless about how he's treated his wife all these years they were together).  The security screens on the windows denotes isolation, the missing lightbulbs shows the darkness and despair of Alexandra, how she made the money to escape this situation shows the level of control her husband exerted over her to control what she did.  We so often only hear about the sensationalized abuse of battered and beaten spouses and children.  This movie drives home that there are other forms of abuse that people endure, possibly many more than of the latter abuse.  It's in the end that we see that although he stands to lose everything, there is still a chance to escape; a chance to find people that can give one a glimmer of hope although the loving gesture of the neighbor is more torture than anything for the ex-father/husband.

Maybe some combination of both but think she had to have the inclination from the start. Reason is people go through relationships similar and accept it without making videos. The critical factor was the husband knew nothing of how she felt and as it turns out, not much about her life at all. Ironically he was a control freak with all the home security as an outward indicator and personally it in that he wouldn't even let her pay the bills. Guess not even having her own money drove her to the extreme of how she felt about their whole relationship. She wanted to do something she was in control of and did she ever show it in spades.

2217680,4,B0007LI10S,"Alexandra's Project is a captivating thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through! True, the story starts out relatively tame; but that eerie sounding music almost from the very beginning really had an impact on me! The acting is superlative; and I really liked the choreography and the cinematography. The plot moves along at a good pace; I was never once bored thanks to the superlative acting particularly by Gary Sweet and Helen Buday. I should add that there is full frontal nudity and a fair amount of swearing in this picture, so this is not exactly a ""family film.""

When the film starts, we meet an Australian family living a suburban life. Steve's (Gary Sweet) birthday starts out well enough with his children giving him presents and high fives; Steve's wife Alexandra (Helen Buday) seems happy enough although we get this foreboding scene in which she says to the mirror that she's not sorry to Steve.

Oh, yes; something major is up! Steve and Alexandra's house has tons of door locks and security features for its windows. Indeed, the house is a type of prison because the locks are both on the inside and the outside; anyone going out needs a key to leave the house! Alexandra seems frustrated when she asks Steve if she can handle the bills; Steve brushes off her request without even looking up from his morning newspaper.

At work, Steve gets a handsome birthday present from his boss--a much coveted promotion! He also looks forward to the ""surprise"" his family is planning for him when he gets home from work.

But when Steve gets home from work, very strange things have occurred. The house is deserted; furniture and children's clothing are strewn about all over the place. Steve at first thinks it's a joke; but it's not--there's only electricity for the VCR, the television, the refrigerator and precious little else. His cell phone battery has even been replaced by a bullet! Steve sees a VCR tape labeled ""Play Me;"" and he sits down in his armchair in front of the TV to watch it.

At first the tape seems wonderful--Alexandra and the kids wish him a happy birthday and then Alexandra does a strip tease that has Steve lusting for his wife. But then Alexandra launches into an angry tirade, some of which Steve skips over because he says he's ""heard it before""--until he sees Alexandra pointing a gun at the screen when he finally stops the tape to watch more of it!

Filmmaker Rolf de Heer said that he wanted to create ""a balance"" between the two characters of Steve and Alexandra; but I have a tough time seeing it. Alexandra's complete message to Steve and her actions on the tape are the hallmark of a rather troubled person; her cruelty is unjustified. True, Steve has been insensitive to Alexandra's needs; but I doubt he deserved everything that was ""coming to him.""

The DVD comes with a few extras. I liked the short film bonus feature and the information about Rolf de Heer, Helen Buday and Gary Sweet was very interesting.

Alexandra's Project will appeal to people who like thrillers; fans of the actors and Rolf de Heer would do well to get this for their collections.",1356220800,,3128,4.674545454545455

2217684,4,B0007LI10S,"Rolf de Heer both wrote and directed this strangely fascinating and equally disturbing 2003 film for a cast of two.  It takes chances (both male and female full frontal nudity among them), relates a tale that will likely make the viewer cringe and have some bad dreams, depends solely  (well, practically solely) on two actors to pull this off, and in the end brings to the table a story of a terminally dysfunctional marriage.

Steve (Gary Sweet) and Alexandra (Helen Buday) live a middle class existence with their two children in Australia. After a strangely cold beginning - today is Steve's birthday and his two children and Alexandra have plans for an evening's celebration.  Steve seems to start the day in an amorous mood but Alexandra is surprisingly unresponsive: Steve's attention is disturbed by the fat, ugly security systems installer neighbor (Bogdan Koca) who is constantly watering his garden. Steve is off, and at work his colleagues present him with a surprise birthday party AND an advancement in his company. When Steve returns home, his house is deserted and darkened with almost all the lightbulbs missing, all easy access outside cut off and a videotape waiting for him, a videotape labeled `play me'. Plugging the tape in Steve is instructed to get a beer and sit and watch what is about to unfold. On the tape Alexandra lays out her complaints about their marriage - Alexandra's feeling of abandonment, lack of sexual fulfillment, lack of intimacy, no control over the direction of her life. One of her biggest complaints is that Steve `married her body' and made love at her, not with her. In an attempt to regain control of her body and her life Alexandra does some sexually perverse things on the tape to humiliate both Steve and the `body' he married. She explains her grievances with him, her reasons for disappearing with the children and her revenge for how he treated her in a way he would never forget. The proceedings on the tape become real-time and the result of how Steve and Alexandra cope forms the surprise ending to this little sour film.

Both Sweet and Buday give convincing performances and the progress of the tape watching keeps the viewer's attention. Much of the back story for the film is left to the viewer's imagination but as far as the experience the script offers, it is a tough and strongly acted experience.

At first I was wary because the plot sounded dull and monotonous but I was at the edge of my seat the whole time even though most of the movie is just Steve watching a video, as other reviewers have noted.  Both Gary Sweet and Helen Bunday do fantastic jobs of conveying their characters' emotions from start to finish.  Had these two not been so superb, the movie would have miserably failed, but they push it to some wild psychological limits, leading me to give this 5 stars.  It's a difficult job to carry a movie on your shoulders like this, especially for Bunday who has to act on camera...for a camera (if that makes any sense..).  Steve and Alexandra are having one-sided conversations and the actors had to emote and express without a live person to do it with - this just made it even more powerful and striking.  It was an intimate and voyeuristic view of a seemingly-fine suburban marriage, and it was a wild exciting and thought-provoking ride.",1308787200,5,1007,4.566666666666666
2217687,2,B0007LI10S,"This movie watches like 1970's progressive, feminist agitprop, 30 years late. The movie definitely has it's moments, but any way you want to slice and dice it, it is ultimately over an hour of a guy sitting in a chair, watching a video on TV of his wife complaining. Yes, the plot is compelling and there's some interesting twists in there, but I found the stationary nature of it bothersome, and caught myself skipping ahead several times.

There are some inconsistencies with her grievances that lead me to believe this is less a tale of a neglected, under appreciated wife, than of someone who was a bit off her trolley. Infidelity on his part is hinted at, but never confirmed. At first she complains about her body ""not being what it used to"" and accusing him of ""getting some on the side"", then later complaining about his horniness and that he only married her for her body, apparently unaware of the obvious contradiction. Assuming anything she accuses him of on the sexual side at home is true (I will assume it will with the boob grab early on in the movie), that's obviously a little creepy, but the sort of things I think any sane woman would have brought up when the events actually happened. The picture painted for me of Steve is that he takes his home life for granted, perhaps a bit of a pervert with his wife, but in the end he loves his family, and all-in-all isn't a particularly bad guy.

I realize it's ""a movie"", but as this movie takes place in the the realm of the plausible, and even possible, it's hard not to juxtapose this against real life implications. Her grievances obviously come out of left field, indicated by his look of surprise at all of this, leading the viewer to believe she's never brought the matter up. 14 years of marriage (at least, one of the children is 14), she's never brought it up, and when she finally does, this is how she does it? If there was ever a, ""passive-aggressive complex of the year award"" she would definitely take it for this little stunt.

Ultimately a not a terrible movie, but would have fared better as a lengthier ""short"". There is kind of a clever twist with the ""video"" angle in the last 10 minutes.",1297814400,8,2173,4.51015228426396

2217690,4,B0007LI10S,"I'm giving this a high rating because it really IS a superbly done movie that kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Tense, disturbing, well-acted. This is a story of one woman unhappy in her marriage, who cooks up a rather original (and extreme) act of revenge against her husband. Most of the film is him watching the VCR tape she's made for him. What throws me off a bit is that I can't quite understand the message behind the film. It comes very close to being nothing more than hateful feminist drivel (and if it was directed by a woman, it would have probably led me to assume just that). If doesn't even attempt to state that the husband was in fact completely deserving of what the wife did to him. Apparently, the only thing this poor man is guilty of is high libido. He doesn't abuse his wife. He's a good father to his kids. He's a good provider. She implies he's cheating, but there's nothing in the film to substantiate this claim. His only sin is that he's constantly horny for his wife - well, I'll be damned! Any woman who can say her husband lusts after her a decade or more after he married her should feel very fortunate. I'm female, and I found myself rooting for the husband every step of the way. I HATED the female lead. Whether or not this was the director's intention, I'm not sure. I felt it was a drawback for me.

Yes, the husband is a bore, but the wife is also a pain in the butt.  Why did she put up with his boorishness all those years?  The interior of the ""perfect"" subdivision home is enhanced by suffocating, slick photography.  However - once the boom is lowered on the birthday boy, things go downhill.  The film becomes predictable and you want to fast-forward (just like the husband does, watching his wife talk-talk-talk) and get it over with already. Slowly but surely the film becomes improbable...too much for the viewer to swallow, irrelevant and vacuous to boot.  It's as if the writer/director's imagination went south. Darn.

And his wife Alexandra promised him a surprise in the evening. Some surprise. The film opens with a camera panning through the winding road of a sterile suburb, and soft, discordant music. The very first sentence of the film belongs to Alexandra as she is alone in the bathroom looking at herself in the mirror: ""I'm so sorry, Steve. . . NO! I'm not sorry! No one should ever be sorry to stand up for their own self!""The rest of the film then takes place in the living room as Steve watches the ""surprise"" birthday tape that Alexandra made before she left him. Her powerfully manipulative monologue to Steve takes him on a roller coaster of emotions straight to hell: humor, disbelief, regret, sadness, pity, anger, rage, and finally despair. ""You didn't marry me, Steve,"" she tells him, ""you married my body."" And so she makes it clear just how a marriage devoid of affection, intimacy, and mutual respect had made her feel.

2217698,4,B0007LI10S,"Many others have already reviewed the plot, so I will stay away from that. I just saw it at our the Cleveland International Film Festival. The director / writer was in attendance for a Q&A after the film.

De Heer claimed that he strived for balance in the two characters when making the film. He also admitted that most people who see the film do not see much balance. He also said that feminist groups were the main advocates for the film.

After watching I came to two conclusions on his intentions.
1. The only balance that I saw is that in the beginning she is miserable and at the end he is miserable.
2. I cant see how any feminst group would get behind this movie. DeHeer portrays this woman as a crazy b#$%#. She is vengeful, she is a whore (literaly), she abuses drugs, and probably worst of all she kidnaps their children.

I would hate to meet the kind of people that support this lunatic. Any feminst that supports a person like this needs mental help. This women is evil and in real life she would lose both of those kids to the father. Dont mistake me here, the father is no choir boy himself. He certainly has his vices and the writer makes sure you know that. But by the end their is only one victim.

As a movie it is very well written and clever. It is a plot that will keep you on the edge of your seat for what will happen next. It ends on a down note with a little humor built in to soften some of the blow.

In whole it is a film that is worth seeing. It will keep your interest and leave you thinking....",1174262400,25,1528,4.148648648648648
2217699,2,B0007LI10S,"The general plot has been covered by other reviewers so I'll skip to the chase. While the film does deliver the promised shock values, there are just too many contrivances, which make this film totally unbelievable, beyond the scope of say a `willing suspension of disbelief'. And intelligent it certainly is not. The first plot blunder, and this is a deal-breaker: is that when he gets home from work and realizes he is locked in, he just sits down and watches the video. Now I don't know about you folks, but the minute I found myself locked into my own house, light bulbs removed, furniture stacked in the corners, wife and kids missing, locks on doors changed, and especially finding my cell phone battery replaced by a bullet(!), I'd be busting down the windows and the walls if need be to get out of there. I'd be taking that video tape straight to the police to finish it there and figure out what happened to my family. At that point any reasonable person has enough information to know that his family was either killed or kidnapped, that the video tape was possibly made at gunpoint. Whatever the case there is absolutely no question, five minutes in that something is horribly horribly wrong. The bullet is the icing on the cake and anyone with half a brain cell would be running for the hills.

So after seeing all this, his sitting down, smoking a cigarette, having a beer, and watching this video which takes up the rest of the film, all feels very much contrived. It's completely against all human instinct and creates a strong tension that the film definitely feeds off of, but unfortunately its a *false* tension which the movie does not deserve and left me through the rest of the film going ""please, this is just dumb, take the tape, get out of there!""

The next layer of false tension, and this is really the broken backbone of the movie, does not come from any intelligent plot or crafty camerawork, but rather just from the pure shock value of everything the wife says and does on film. Its definitely shocking and I give the film two stars just for the shock value, but its all just so unbelievable. It's just not plausible in any way that somebody could be so very smart and so very well spoken and feel so very much abused *every day* and yet so completely fail for all those years to convey these feelings to their partner. In real life, 13 years earlier in the marriage she would have slapped his hand one night and said `I don't appreciate your touching me like that'. End of story.

Another layer I just can't buy, the film goes on and on about how he married her for her body, well what did she marry him for?! There is no allusion at all to his having changed over time, so what gives?

Bottom line, this is another shallow female revenge flick where the woman's horrific acts are justified by the man's density and inability to understand, fueled by false tensions, and ending in his lying down and giving up (once again, oh please).

There is nothing more intelligent to the shock value here than what you'd see in Reservoir Dogs. Shocking yes, intelligent no. But where Reservoir Dogs had no pretenses of being intelligent or thoughtful and was therefore a solid film in its own right, this one falls flat. If you are just looking for cheap shock factor, check it out, but if you're looking for an intelligent, believable suspense-drama look elsewhere.",1167696000,12,3386,4.580858085808581

This is not even the kind of film you ""recommend"": as in ""you have to see this film"" -- it is a difficult film to watch (and I assume this would be true whether you are male or female).  It is, nonetheless a powerful film, that can be easily misunderstood (as if it were merely a kind of ""female revenge"" picture: kill bill where Alexandra destroys the psyche rather than the body; even to compare this film to the Japanese film ""Audition"" would be a serious misunderstanding).  One of the latest films by Australian auteur Rolf de Heer, Alexandra's project is a nuanced and subtle attack on the ways in which men (backed up by cultural myths of what it means to be a ""successful man"") objectify the women in their lives.  To any one who has seen the film, this might seem like sarcasm: there is nothing subtle about Alexandra's ""project,"" and she is extraordinarily blunt.  What is subtle about the film is the way in which Rolf de Heer shows how easily Steve (the ""protagonist"" and ""victim"" of the film) completely misses the point of her message, how fully he misunderstands her (and how easy it is to share in that misunderstanding as an audience member).  The despair and devastation he feels does not amount to a realization that for so long he has deliberately misunderstood and denied her needs (believing that to ""provide for her"" is enough) -- rather, he begins to feel that what she is showing is her own ""masculine lust"" and it turns him on even as it devastates him (what destroys him, ""unmans"" him, effectively, is his belief that what this was about was her feeling lust analogous to the lust he had never seen to be problematic in himself).  He can't see that what she is doing in a confused effort to get him to listen to her is at least as painful to her as it is to himself, that while he gets simultaneously aroused and disgusted she feels only disgust for herself and at him.  It is really this misunderstanding that, once perceived, serves best as a mirror for the ""masculine image"" that has been so harmful to both Steve and Alexandra.  The misunderstanding is, for us, what is being shown in an effort to reach understanding.",1150416000,,2247,4.487745098039215
2217702,3,B0007LI10S,"There's no denying that Alexandra's Project is a disappointment coming from Rolf de Heer, who made the superb The Tracker, one of the best Australian films of the decade. It's extremely well crafted and hides its low budget quite ingeniously, but unfortunately the birthday surprise that Gary Sweet gets from wife Helen Buday doesn't really hold together if you shake the package too much. Partially it's because the punishment seems far in excess of the crime, partially because you get the feeling that Rolf de Heer has been reading feminist literature just to compile a shopping list of grievances (most of them valid), but mainly because the holes in logic get bigger as the revenge grows out of proportion to the offence until the somewhat ridiculous climax: it's simply not credible even within the framework of the film. But the real problem is that you end up feeling sympathy for the husband for having the misfortune to marry so such wacko, which clearly is not the idea.

There's still much to admire. De Heer sustains the suspense as to what exactly will happen while creating a plausible air of impending dread, the distortion from the anamorphic lenses on doorways and corridors adding to the sense that something's definitely off here, while Sweet is outstandingly good in a role that requires mainly reaction shots from an armchair. Buday is impressive too, but it's more an impressive ""performance"" with odd moments of truth rather than an entirely convincing human being in the way that Sweet's character is - more a fault of the agenda-led writing of her scenes than her own commendably brave efforts.

2217703,3,B0007LI10S,"Ok...

Based on the reviews I've read, my girlfriend and I decided to rent this one from the library.  One hundred and three mintues later, we were both emotionally drained and still wondering what the hell did we just view.

My girlfriend picked up the DVD case sitting next to us and flipped it over to view the back of it.  She read aloud, ""The Toronto Star said this is 'a movie that will leave few men unrattled and many women vicariously satisfied.'""  She then turned to me and said, ""'Vicariously satisfied?'  What unwanted, unloved bitch had the gall to write that statement?""

In this day and age of ""femme fatale""/Thelma and Louise movies, this one is full of bark AND bite, leaving very little else for anything but conversation when its over.  I'm sure that that's what the director, Rolf de Heer, wanted to have happen among couples who watch this movie.  The funny thing is there would not of been a movie if the main characters DID what de Heer expects his viewers to do:  TALK.

Instead, we're treated to a woman, who, though sane, is DEFINATELY not rational.  During her ""project"", it is implied that her husband, Steve, may of had affairs within the marriage, will not let her have money, will not let her take control of any bills, and, if assuming that everything she tells us through videotape is true, he's not emotionally there for her.  But that in no way justifies the actions for which she'll take all in a single night to ""explain"" herself to him.  The result leaves one with a bad taste in their mouth after being witness to her anger at and liberation from Steve.

My girlfriend and I will go to the middle and give this movie three stars.  It is a well written, extremely well acted film.  However.....

Any woman leaving this film 'vicariously satisfied' had better examine their own relationships if this is the kind of film that evokes that emotion from you.

She's ""unhappy,"" and tells us so but it's never really convincing nor do her vague reasons justify her actions. Not even close. The husband (forgot his name already - ""Steve,"" maybe?) - yeah, he does some nice guy/good dad things but they're very general, everyday things a regular guy would do, working as White Collar Businessman for Vague Corporation. And there's no indication that he's in any way the person Alexandra describes. There should be some clue, some crumbs, to foreshadow her actions and perhaps get us on board.
Visually, there's not much going on. Many of the scenes are just excruciatingly plodding with ""business"" that seems to take forever. Steve (screw it, I'm calling him Steve whether it's right or not) turns on a light switch; insert of light not turning on; Steve tries again; insert to light, still nothing; close-up Steve's reaction to this...and so on and so on for every thing. I found myself screaming at the screen ""WILL YOU JUST GET ON WITH IT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!"" And of course most of the film as a long whiny monologue from Alexandra (we're watching her on a VCR tape) intercut with Steve's facial expressions. It's brutal.
The only characters I cared about were the kids, who were essentially just props but after all this I was concerned for their future. Poor Steve, yeah, but again he's underdeveloped so I don't really care, and never gave a fig about Alexandra.
Lastly, you're waiting for the big Plot Twist, the piece of irony that turns the story on its head, taking it in a new direction. i'm still waiting.
This is typical regional film festival material. You walk out afterwards, people ask you how it was, you say ""meh, it was okay, I guess."" And the only reason you're so generous is because you're comparing it to the unfocused mishmash from the two-bit David Lynch wannabe you saw that afternoon. But like most of the other films you see at the festival, the story just isn't there - just a general idea of one.",1499558400,,2267,4.655860349127182
