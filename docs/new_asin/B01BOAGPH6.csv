8750895,3,B01BOAGPH6,"This is a  very subjective review.  So, to me the audio is just great and the video portion is just horrible.  I am  reminded of VHS quality.  The seller  was great and I suspect that for this particular concert this is the highest quality available out there.  I had been looking for this concert in any format for years so despite the flaws in the video I am happy to add this to my Bowie collection.  So there you have it folks, the short and sweet.",1456358400,4,452,4.174418604651163
