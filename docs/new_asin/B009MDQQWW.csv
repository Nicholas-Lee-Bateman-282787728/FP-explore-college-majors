8543005,4,B009MDQQWW,"Great Cinematography of the Underwater world in HD. I especially liked the species and location subtitle provided. It is more expensive than other Blue Ray disc on this subject but there is wealth of information. You can use it to identify fishes after Scuba Diving, snorkeling etc.",1428796800,,282,5.0212765957446805
8543006,5,B009MDQQWW,"Stunning HD vivid visuals of the Great Barrier Reef! Relaxing Music that takes you to a Better World. I buy domestic and Import Ocean Videos, this is among the best, to date. The one thing that I noted, is the photographers know how, to truly capture sea life, in a way, where they are not scaring or chasing the fish. Amazing,  well worth cost. Disk offers many options. Love it!!!",1364169600,2,382,4.457142857142857
8543007,3,B009MDQQWW,"I thought this would be a remastered high def version of the original 1999 disc which is my favorite nature/chilling disc of all time. This is different, with different footage, and a similar but different soundtrack. The original soundtrack was so beautiful it brought me to tears.  Not so with the new version. This disc is OK, but not nearly as good as the original.",1358121600,3,369,4.676923076923077
8543008,5,B009MDQQWW,"I must say, nothing but pure bliss and pleasure in my experience purchasing this item. Very prompt in the delivery time and was better than advertised. The intensity of the images in this video are unreal. Well worth the investment. David Hannan should receive awards for his work in this piece.",1357430400,2,295,4.803921568627451
8543009,5,B009MDQQWW,"The transaction was smooth...I requested it to be sent to another address and it arrived as requested.  I chose this video because I have seen it before...a family member is going through chemo and I thought this was a very soothing video to watch while going through treatment.
Thank You!",1355788800,3,289,4.78
