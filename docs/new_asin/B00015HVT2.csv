1972056,5,B00015HVT2,"I have already watched the first three DVDs of this series.  At first, I must confess I didn't get it.  Being this series so radically different from the rest it took me quite a while to realize how a magnificent and convoluted the story is.  It keeps you wondering, always asking for more.
Additionally, this series is superbly well-researched.  For instance, the many arcane symbols that the different witches use to perform their deadly craft are not made up but meticulously taken from real, historical sources.  You can learn about them in the impressive, highly detailed extras in each of the DVDs.
Unlike all other anime heroines I know, Robin brings a complex sensuality that does not depend on showing off her curves or her underwear.  On the contrary, she is utterly dressed from the neck to the toes and, more often than not, she also wears gloves.  Yet I find Robin Sena to the most sensual woman I have ever seen on animation.  Her ways are subtle yet convoluted, cautious yet elegantly refined, seemingly innocent yet self-assured.
The insigths and acumen of the fifteen-year old Robin are astonishing despite her constantly being kept in the dark by chief Kosaka and the seemingly impenetrable Zaizen, the head of STNJ. The other characters that revolve and react around her are extremely well-depicted.  Amon is my personal favorite being so enigmatic, aloof, and fully unpredictable --perplexing even his partners Karasuma, Dojima, Sakaki, and Michael Lee.
Perhaps the biggest achievements of this series are the inner, psychological struggles of its characters and the struggles among themselves within their fascinating undercover organization.  In one way or another, each character is, ultimately, a loner who does not fully understand the ultimate consequences of their difficult, gory work of hunting human beings endowed with special powers. As it happens, many forces within STNJ collide against one another as checks and counter-checks for the maintenance of the balance of power. Indeed,  even STNJ forms part of ---and is subordinated to-- a global organization.  The so-called ""Company,"" that is to say, the STNJ parallel agency that deals with the witches once captured, remains almost absolute mystery to us viewers.  I cannot wait to see how the series unfolds, how the many mysteries are solved --or failed to being solven, bringing in the very process, even more drama and tension to the series.  Up to this point, I can honestly say that Witch Hunter Robin is the best anime series I have ever have the priviledge to watch.",1078099200,5,2558,5.073985680190931

8006743,5,B00015HVT2,I love Witch Hunter Robin!,1445904000,,26,4.4
8006744,3,B00015HVT2,"In this volume, Robin is confronted with the morality and hypocrisy of hunting witches with her powers. She begins to doubt herself. An inquisitor comes to test a possible comrade, but he may have other objectives. As Robin's relationship with the other team members seems to grow, her position with the organization seems to be in some sort of jeopardy. Could there be a conspiracy? Can Robin trust anyone anymore? Do I care enough to keep watching?

Holy cow! Why are there so many 5 star reviews for this series. The character animation is lax, the music is boring, the story moves at a snails pace, and none of the characters have any personality. Apparently it doesn't take much to entertain some people. You see this all the time with anime. Even the worst anime out there, probably 009-1, gets great reviews. I can only conjecture that there are people that love anime just because it's anime. I admit that sometimes I like shows for similar reasons. Despite these feelings, I can't bring myself to be entertained by something as mediocre as this series. Not 1 aspect of this show deserves 5 stars. I have never given up on an anime before, and I'll continue to watch it because I have already seen 14 episodes of it. But it has had plenty of time to pick up and develop. I'm afraid that this one is just a dud.",1360886400,,1318,4.53781512605042
8006745,3,B00015HVT2,"Robin Sena should have stayed in the nunnery.

Vol. 3, Inquisition, changes the entire tone of the series.  No more vignettes about the detective work and apprehension of various witches.  Here the episodes are all connected and do not stand alone as did previous episodes.  Hang on, Robin fans, things are going to get bumpy.

In the first two episodes, Robin meets an old woman in a wheelchair who claims to have been alive during the Salem Witch trials of the late 1600's.  Robin is mesmerized yet horrified by the strange tale Methusulah is spinning to her.  Her carefully ordered world begins to fall apart.

In the third episode, an Inquisitor arrives.  Looking for all the world like a Puritan fanatic straight from the 17th century, he proceeds to horrifyingly lure out and trap a witch who is desperately trying to be left alone.  But Robin is also trapped, and committs an act that shocks her and Amon.

The last two episodes involve a conspiracy to kill Robin.  And you will not believe who is at the heart of it.

Vol. 3 contains episodes 11-14: The Soul Cages, Precious Illusions, The Eyes of Truth, and Loaded Guns.  This DVD is not as good a value as vol. 2 which contains five episodes.  But you're past that point now, aren't you?",1101686400,3,1247,4.6045454545454545
8006746,5,B00015HVT2,"First Robin runs into a witch who claims to know the truth behind Witches, the Craft, and about Robin herself.  A witch that may be 300 years old.  Then the Inquisitor comes to test a potential hunter.  Or is he there to test somebody else?
And who is Robin sending the information to in episode 12?
Then Robin has a strange vision and is attacked, by attackers using bullets that the Witch Hunters' stopped using a couple years ago.  Anti-witch bullets.
Is everybody around her in danger or are they helping those who are hunting her?
The DVD holds extras in the form of notes, vehicle files, an interview and a reversible cover.",1083110400,4,630,4.548672566371682
8006747,5,B00015HVT2,"This is what it's all about, the ending, the trilogy, the journey to the end. I've watched all three volumes and recomend it to any dark thriller chiller anime lovers. 9.5/10. Brought to screen by perfection, optunistic scenes, exhilirating charecters and a classic storyline chiller inspired by non other than the chiller inventor himself, Alfred Hitchcock. If You've experienced this movie, i recommend another classic period drama/dark comedy anime, Tokyo Gothfather.",1081814400,6,470,5.633802816901408
8006748,5,B00015HVT2,"Four episodes.  Only four episodes.  I am so ready to cry!  MORE, PLEASE!  I haven't been this excited about an anime since Cowboy Bebop.  Considering that Bebop has set the standard for anime as I know it, that's saying a lot.  I am completely in Witch Hunter's clutches.
If you're reading this review, you've probably already seen Witch Hunter 1 and 2, so I won't recap the overall plot.  What I will say is that the first 2 episodes of disk 3 set up the Methusalah witches, and the 3rd episode show how STN differentiates between a witch and a craft user.  Good stuff.  Very good stuff.
It was the 4th episode - 'Loaded Guns' - that really got me, though.  I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.  I don't want to give anything away, so I'm going to avoid talking about it too much.  What I will say is that this episode was on par with Cowboy Bebop's Ballad of Fallen Angels.  Again, this is high praise.
Argh.  I'm so upset that there wasn't a fifth episode on this disk!  You're completely left hanging!
My advice for what it's worth - buy this disk.  For that matter, buy this series.  It's excellent.  I'm really impressed so far.  Hopefully the other disks will please me just as much!
Happy viewing.",1080950400,4,1215,4.34375
8006749,5,B00015HVT2,"Slightly earlier than one would expect, the issue of the nature of Robin's powers shifts to the center of the stage.  While she has always referred to her ability as her 'craft,' the viewer cannot help but se this as a bit of terminological obfuscation.  What has separated Robin from the witches she hunts is that her powers are only partially awakened, limited by her training by the Church.
Suddenly Robin faces an older witch, and 'immortal' who has experienced the full weight of the world's persecution of the witchbreed - the descendants of ancient gods.  Her story leaves Robin vulnerable, and a following visit by an Inquisitor, ostensible to examine another witch, something deep within her changes.
Robin becomes the target of unexpected attempts on her life.  He relationship with Amon becomes more equivocal.  While the episodes build a great deal of tension while developing the story line in this direction, writer Aya Yoshinaga and the rest of the creative staff are careful to lead the viewer's suspicions in many directions, stirring up as many mysteries as possible.
Time is taken to develop the rune-based system of magic more than it has been previously.  This leads me to think that ritual may play an increasing part as the antagonists solidify.  Right now there are countless suspects - several church brotherhoods or confraria, the STNJ, the Factory, and the witches themselves.  For now we can only expect the unexpected as the intricate plot continues to unfold.
Production continues to set a high standard for anime. Both background art and animation set a neo-gothic atmosphere that is fascinating on its own.  A great deal of research has gone into the creation of an alternate world where science and witchcraft continue an age-old war.  The English acting and dubbing are a bit stiff, but entirely acceptable.  Definitely worth viewing.",1078704000,20,1868,5.052117263843648
8006750,3,B00015HVT2,"-- 3.5 stars --
When the third volume of Robin came to my home it was a somber moment. I've never given up on a series before...but in between pre-ordering the DVD and the time it arrived (a good while thanks to the 2 month wait in between volumes)...I decided that if these episodes didn't hook me it was time to hit the eject button.
I was honestly baffled. The receipe was nothing short of fantastic on paper: the show had great art, an interesting group of characters, a solid story, and several directions it could go in. However, the food it dished out was hardly gormet. Episodes were stale and predictable, character development lacking, dialogue insultingly dumbed down, and use of conflict limitted to mundane rubbish. And yet...I keep on watching...because I believe in the formula...it's gotta pay out...doesn't it?
There are four episodes on the third volume of Witch Hunter Robin. Half way into the DVD (episodes 11 and 12), I gave up. Nothing had changed; nothing improved. I was done with the series but decided to just finish the DVD, afterall, the money was spent.
The last two episodes, starting with lucky 13, were top notch and everything I had hoped the show would become. But again...it took 12 episodes of blandsville to bring us here. The show is finally heading in a direction that is worth watching, yet, until a whole volume is filled with episodes as good as the later parts of this DVD, I'd consider renting vs owning if you haven't already invested.",1078185600,9,1480,4.718146718146718
