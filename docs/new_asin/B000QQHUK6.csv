8196922,4,B000QQHUK6,"I had been hesitant to get this set for a long time based on reviews here and elsewhere that the transfers were terrible, and the disks wouldn't play, but I eventually took a chance and ordered it anyway, and I'm glad I did. The films are the midnight movie trash I love, and it is a real grab bag, with movies spanning from 1936-1983 and everything in between, I already had several of these movies on other sets from Mill Creek and other distributors, so I had a decent idea what I was getting as far as content, but what suprized me with this set is the transfers and prints of many of the films turned out to be much better than the ones I had previously, even the films I had on other sets from Mill Creek, specifically Cathy's Curse and She-Beast, my previous versions were nearly unwatchable, and as a result I had no idea what great flicks they were, that is not to say that these are great or definitive transfers or prints, because they are not, and quality does very from film to film, but I am really happy to have many of these films in my collection in a form that is complete and the audio and video is good enough to enjoy the films without too much distraction from imperfections.",1297728000,,1197,4.300884955752212
8196923,4,B000QQHUK6,"Overall a really nice set for fans of oldie horror movies! Image quality is not always crystal-clear, but then these films used to look pretty grungy when they used to show them on late-night TV anyway!",1231372800,2,202,4.638888888888889
8196924,1,B000QQHUK6,"I bought this set expecting average-to-poor transfers of 20 B-movies - my expections were very, very low, but so was the price and I like B-movies.  Unfortunately, not all of the DVDs in this set play in any of my three DVD players at home (none of which have had problems in the past), and at least one movie has been edited, based on descriptions of the movie read elsewhere.

Some of these 20/50/100/250 movie packs get good reviews, and the drive-in one that I also bought is turning out better, but I would advise against this set due to the editing and unplayable DVDs.",1212624000,6,575,4.466666666666667
8196925,3,B000QQHUK6,"Except for some stock footage of Bela Lugosi's eyes, none of the ""biggies"" of mid-20th century horror are to be found on the BEYOND THE GRAVE 20 MOVIE PACK. Your more standard public domain fright films aren't here either. These 5 double-sided DVDs will be ""new blood"" for aficionados of obscurities, but for the beginning collector this one might not be the best place to start your horror movie library.

Another unusual MILL CREEK DVD set is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CHILLING-CLASSICS-50-MOVIE-PACK/dp/B000AOEQ4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CHILLING CLASSICS 50 MOVIE PACK</a>. There's a lot of famous actors here in many lesser-known films.
