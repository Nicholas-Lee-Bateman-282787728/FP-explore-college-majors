8151761,5,B000JLTRBS,"The Perfect Date Movies Vol. 5-Love and Devotion(The Object Of My Affection/Hope Floats/ A Walk In The Clouds/ Prelude To A Kiss), are fun for dates but just as fun for ""Girls Night Out"". I had seen and enjoyed these in the past and purchased these for my daughter in college as a surprise and winter fun! She enjoyed them and was happy to have gotten them! How can you go wrong with these ? We are very pleased with our purchase!",1330473600,,430,4.2560975609756095
8151762,2,B000JLTRBS,"I puchased this set at Walmart for $12. I picked it up because I had been planning on buying Hope Floats and The Object Of My Affection. When I saw that I could get both of them along with Prelude to a Kiss(which I have never seen but wanted to)and A Walk In the Clouds(which I already owned) I figured it would be like getting a movie for free and I wasn't too bothered with having to replace the other one. Anyways,the movies themselves are all good ones,but the picture quality is SO poor! Hope Floats was really blurry and looked like it was out of focus the whole time. The same with Prelude. Also,the above reviewer mentioned that these were like regular full Dvds and had a lot of special features...ummm. no they dont! You get a generic disc menu and the only special features are the theatrical trailers. Zip. That is it. The discs are in slim cases,which I like because they take up half of the room of regular dvds. The pictures on the discs are the same pictures as on full dvds except they are grainy(like a newspaper picture) and are clearly some cheap copy. For those out there who want this for the movies themselves and don't mind it not having special features or care that the picture is low quality,then pick this up. If you care about these things then I would avoid this set altogether and look for special collectors editions as these usually have great picture quality!",1267488000,,1393,4.466666666666667
8151763,4,B000JLTRBS,"The five volumes in FOX HOME VIDEO's PERFECT DATE MOVIES all have a ""Love & ____"" theme. The four titles in each set are on individual discs and presented in widescreen format. Quality of the transfers is excellent. Provided extras are those typical of full-priced, single release DVDs: commentary tracks, theatrical trailers, ""making of"" featurettes, deleted and extended scenes, etc.

This final entry in the series contains four movies released in the 1990s. The general theme is unlikely couples.

SYNOPSES for PDM #5 (Love & Devotion)--

HOPE FLOATS--  Birdee moves back to her small Texas hometown after the her husband's affair with Birdee's best friend is made public on a national TV talk show. The townspeople of Smithville aren't too understanding of Birdee's plight.

THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION--  George and Nina share an apartment and similar interests. They'd be the ideal couple if George wasn't gay. Nina's pushy boyfriend gets her pregnant and wants Nina to marry him, but she'd rather stay single. Now George has to decide if he can handle being a surrogate dad for his unmarried friend's baby.

PRELUDE TO A KISS--  Adapted from the 1990 Tony Award-winning play. Somewhat supernatural story of a bride that switches bodies with a stranger, an old man who crashes her wedding, when this fellow kisses her at the wedding reception. Good ensemble cast.

A WALK IN THE CLOUDS--  A returning WWII vet meets a girl on a bus. She tells him of her fear that her vineyard-owning father will disown her when he learns that she's pregnant and unmarried, so the soldier volunteers to temporarily masquerade as her husband. Anthony Quinn and California's wine country steal the show in this fine romantic film.
