8063498,1,B0009NMKUQ,"We received a baby genius dvd as a gift and our son likes most of it. However, the adults in our family find the baby genius shows to be visually irritating and the music just so so (adults do not feel good while watching this). Compare this to ""Baby Signing Time"" which is visually interesting/ soothing and has fantastic music that the whole family enjoys.

Anyway, I ordered this set based on the great reviews, but two of the DVDs would not play all the way through so we returned it. I see a lot of other folks have complained of the same problems. Looks like Amazon has a bad batch.",1324857600,,588,4.297297297297297
8063499,5,B0009NMKUQ,"My daughter liked those three DVDs a lot. Especially the Favorite Children Songs. I even liked it, I am a DJ is all our families favorite. We let her watch one of those like 2 times a day. I think each last for half an hour. Helpful when she refuses to eat or when she is cranky...

I must weight 5000 pounds.. ;)",1244160000,,313,3.9682539682539684
8063500,5,B0009NMKUQ,"I disovered Baby Genius on my ""On Demand"" of my cable and wish I would have purchased this product earlier. At 18 months it was one of the few shows we could put on while I made dinner or took a potty break and would keep their attention. My kids are now 2 1/2 and still love it, especially the ones with the songs, but they really like all of them. I just wish I hadn't purchased the audio CDs prior to buying this because they come with bonus audio CDs.",1235174400,,455,4.010989010989011
8063501,5,B0009NMKUQ,"We gave this to our now 7 month old son for Christmas.  He enjoys the DVD with the children's songs when he's in his jumper, and we use the CD while we're in the kitchen feeding him.  I'm glad we bought it, it really does keep him entertained for some time.",1203033600,,257,4.019607843137255
8063502,1,B0009NMKUQ,"These DVDs are very poorly made. The songs & the pictures don't match. After we watched once, we don't want to watch them again. Instead, I went to buy the ""Baby Einstein"" series for our 15 months son which he's been watching over & over again and never gets tired of it. It's of much better quality, very educational & entertaining. One of the DVD we received from the""Baby Genius"" series won't even play're very disappointed. One thing we've learnt is we'll never buy another prouduct of Baby Genius ever again. It's a brand name to distrust--poor quality.",1186790400,2,558,4.704081632653061
8063503,5,B0009NMKUQ,we started watching these with our 15 month old on Comcast On Demand. She dances and knows all the songs now. Super fun!,1171152000,,120,4.260869565217392
