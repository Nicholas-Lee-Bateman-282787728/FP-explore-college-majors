5931063,4,B00EOMJA3I,My wife really likes Dance Moms. These kids are very talented but the pressure on them is a lot for young people. It seams that the moms want it for them more than the kids do.,1401580800,2,176,3.9166666666666665
5931064,4,B00EOMJA3I,"I love watching these beautiful, talented girls dance from week to week, or competition to competition.  I especially love to watch Nia.  I would love to see someone choke Abby Lee with a Submarine sandwich.  If she was located in New York City, she would be sitting in Riker's Island for child abuse.  MOMS, WAKE UP!  How dare someone abuse your daughters and you just sit and take it, or argue against it.  There are thousands of Choreographers you can choose from.  Is Abby that good or are you just in for the pay you get each episode?",1393286400,,539,4.438775510204081

5931068,1,B00EOMJA3I,"Like probably everyone else I was very disapointed in this DVD. I orderted it from Germany and was soooo exited when it arrived here, because Im a huge DM fan, but its just trash. I believed it would be a DVD shown the dances from DM full and in good quality. When I opened it I immidiatly noticed that it said on the Cover, Dances from Season 3. First disapointment. Then when I watched it I was shoked to find out that it weren't Dances, it were 6 episodes from season three. (As mention in one of the other Reviews: Yes its an totally Maddie Story, as ALWAYS!!!! I hate it!!!!!)
There are only three dances I think full on the Dvds. Rosa Parks, Beautiful Day and one more. No Chloe Solo, none of the Solos Paige did that weren't shown on the show, no first class group number. Its a DVD with 6 episodes of season 3 which I certenly will buy when it comes out, but this DVD was a total wast of money. Save your money, watch these three dances on youtube and buy season 3! The DVD is just a shame!",1385942400,14,998,4.123076923076923
5931069,1,B00EOMJA3I,"In the description, it said it would feature episodes from seasons 1 and 2 of Dance Moms, upon receiving the package, it had changed to feature season 3. The description also stated that it would feature never before seen on TV dances and full dances, however, all the dances have been aired on TV and the full versions have been available on Lifetime's website for months and can also be found on YouTube. This is false advertisement at its best and I highly suggest you don't buy this DVD",1384214400,28,490,4.51685393258427

8607468,5,B00EOMJA3I,"My granddaughter was recommended for Performing Company shortly before her 6th birthday. Maddie is her favorite dancer after seeing her in Sia's videos, but prior to that we had never watched Dance Moms. I had seen clips here or there, but wow! Those moms are so catty and competitive! I got the DVD so my granddaughter can watch Maddie and the girls dance and see what it takes to dance competitively and professionally. Aside from the moms, I think the DVD has good material to help my granddaughter for as long as she wishes to dance!",1495756800,,537,4.604166666666667
8607469,3,B00EOMJA3I,"This was advertised as the best of Season 1 and 2 dances, including full-length dances and never-before-seen dances, but it was just a collection of episodes from Season 3!  And not even the best episodes, or a group of episodes in order - but 6 random episodes!  If I had spent more than $6.50 for this, I would have returned it to get my money back!  The only reason I gave this 3 stars was that the video and audio quality was fine, and it was delivered to me on time.  Amazon, please be more careful of the descriptions you post!",1485302400,2,533,4.247524752475248
