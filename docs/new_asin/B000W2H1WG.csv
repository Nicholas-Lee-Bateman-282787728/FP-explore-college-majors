Traces of Death III...Is the third installment in the ultra disturbing shockumentary series and I'm back to share with you my unique take on this widely popularly  ""unpopular"" series Traces of Death III is put together like most death scene movies and it continues in the tradition of the previous installments in the series it is approximately 90 minutes long and has photos and live videos in black/white and gives you little to no narration and this aids in making you speculate and adds to the shock value and on top of this is another soundtrack with some of the hottest bands in the death metal industry including  such talents of artists like: Purge, Sinister, Meshuggah, Brutality, Dead World, Dismember, Deceased, Gorefest, Core, Macabre, Benediction, Hypocrisy, Incantation & Repulsion just to name a few. This installment is one of the worst and (for some odd reason) one of the most readably available installments in the series to acquire. This shockumentary contains more murders, autopsies, rare vintage medical vault footage, aftermath of suicide bombers and an introduction to one of the vilest storm troopers of death on the planet: The El Salvadorian Death Squad!!!

The movie begins with a statement and introduction from Darron Fox now known as Brain Damage and he gives you a brief history of the music and what's in store for you inside his compilation of death scenes. Traces of Death III... Begins with shocking scenes of the aftermath of suicide bombers whose victims include men, women and children.  I must inform you that during some graphic footage showing decayed remains you'll hear some exerts of the original movie Helter Skelter and the voice of the actor playing Charles Manson!!!  There is lots of animal footage in this movie as well, including but not limited to: Pit Bull fights, Bull Fighting, Hunters drinking cups of blood from a slaughtered cow, a man eating live scorpions, the illegal slaughter of dolphins for false tuna sales and a disturbing look into hunger as an impoverished group of people cut up and eat a beautiful white camel, (This is by far my least favorite segments in the traces of death series but I can perhaps ease your qualms by saying, from my researches most of this repulsive activity was done  for food and survival purposes only.) This movie border lines on what many would consider Satanic and it is possibly one of the most disturbing additions to the series for this reason.

There is a long segment about a crude circumcision rite performed on young boys and after more than 30 nonstop cuts back to back of this brutal ceremony will leave most with a lack of respect for the tactless and overly reinforced cruelty upon the viewer and if that were not bad enough they show a pre-teen girl (in this same country) in a puberty rite where they remove her c------- (In this region of the world women are for work and to bare children only and thier belief is that it is not needed.) thankfully that segment is all but just a few seconds. I can understand the difference and acceptance of such rites in other foreign cultures but it is shown way too carelessly. That is however Brain Damages strategy as he has this belief that if one scene doesn't disturb you than the next one surely will and he makes certain of it. I can tell you from experience that Darron does not pull any punches at what it is he shows you. Once again, the lack of any explanation for scenes such as these, on top of the thundering music, will most definitely overpower and successfully disturb the viewer.

There is also lots of body modifications such as, the ancient art of tattooing in another country where they use razor blades to cut on the skin of people (including a woman's breasts) and then rub some kind of make shift ink over the open cuts creating scarification and a permanent tattoo all at the same time. In another we are shown modifications to the teeth as enamel is scraped off and then chipped away by a chisel. All and all this one is not as bad as it sounds but it will certainly offend some. There is also a segment showing a woman having a snake flick its tongue all over her body as Brain Damage says, and I quote, ""You will have to use your own imagination as to where this snake ends up"" and that's the end of that (WTF?) that would have been a rite I actually would have rather seen VS the before mentioned puberty rites (Thanks for nothing Darron)!  The movie closes with a segment of the torture and mutilation inflicted by the El Salvadorian Death Squad after which is another statement from Brain Damage.

There are a lot of new elements introduced here that do not necessarily have to do with death per se' but actually they might, a good example of this, is where they show you a quick segment of child birth... The baby comes popping out of the birth canal followed with the afterbirth splashing out everywhere (I find that more puke inducing then almost anything I have ever seen and most of all my male friends agree) and probably insinuates ""the moment your born your dying"".

There is also some very graphic scenes of a girl who fell victim of a true ""Silence of the Lambs"" story, the only problem is it is divided into two separate sections and they go by lightning quick. The first section shows you the inside of what appears to be someone's (dungeon like) basement where you see a person who is gagged, bound by their wrists and hanging by chains from the ceiling (this is all in a split second and unless you slow the video down you probably won't notice it). The second section (which is later in the film) is a camera immediately entering a room where another girl is bound by chains from the floor and has evidently been shackled for so long that when they are removed you see where her ankles have decayed and rotted from lack of breathing room, right after this they show yet another split second of the killer who did these crimes.

I liked this addition in the series as well as the others especially for the very good music and some off topic oddities of mankind from around the world. There is an obvious display that Darron is showing off some of his other bizarre collection of footage (and from the look of things) I seriously doubt he's going to run out of more shocking video and photos any time soon, but for now... Traces of Death III is... Dead and Buried!!!",1341532800,4,6522,4.601549053356282
