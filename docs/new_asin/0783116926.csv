70721,5,0783116926,"I first watched this movie when I was 13 (almost 20 years ago) and it scared everything out of me then and still manages to do so each time I watch it.  I have an old copy of it on video now and it still chills me to  the bone, especially during the seance and the wheelchair scene.  Scary  indeed!  Best to be viewed with the lights out, cold and stormy night with  friends or just with someone you can snuggle up to on the lounge during  those ""spookie"" moments.",922233600,,464,4.088888888888889
70722,5,0783116926,"I bought this movie on Video after seeing it on Showtime several years ago. Best to watch it with all the lights off and during a thunderstorm, hehe.
This movie is my absolute favorite scary movie. It's one that  really WILL give you nightmares!!
There seems to be very very few,if any,  movies that are as scary as this one.(Too bad) In fact, I wish directors  and writers would take a clue and give us more movies such as this one.
The scariest scenes in this movie are from the seance and  afterward,  when George C. Scott's listening to the taped session... and the SCARIEST  SCENE FOR ME TO WATCH... is when the steadycam fluidly races up the stairs  and up to the attic to where the boy died. W-O-W. That scene to this day,  just CHILLS ME TO THE BONE!!!!
NOT A MOVIE FOR THE YOUNG OR  EASILY-FRIGHTENED.
For all scary-movie lovers BUY THIS MOVIE YOU'LL  NEVER REGRET IT!",921801600,5,877,4.425
70723,5,0783116926,"I've read hundreds of horror novels and short stories and seen countless movies; I love the genre.  'The Changeling' is very probably the best horror movie ever made, period.  It actually scared me, repeatedly, when  almost nothing else ever has.",920246400,,246,5.1
70724,5,0783116926,"i first watch this movie in my ninth grade english class right before halloween.  i fell in love with it then and i still rent it every halloween, and some of the months in between.  it scares me so much every  time no matter what number of viewing it is.  it's a classic and i have yet  to find a better written horror ghost story.  thanks, anndi",918086400,,347,4.104477611940299
70725,5,0783116926,One of the rarest ghost storys that can be watched without having to worry about gore and nudity.  The scares come from the storyline not from someones head being chopped off.  A must have for your video collection.  I  only wish they would put this title out on DVD.,913161600,,267,4.387755102040816
70726,4,0783116926,"This is one helaciously scary movie that continues to scare and entertain me almost 15 years after I first saw it.  There isn't any gore; but it's really a much scarier movie because of the lack of gratuitous violence.  If  you want a good video for your next party, forget Scream -- get this one.  If you can get past their funky seventies hairdos, you'll really enjoy a  spectacularly spooky movie.",912643200,,400,4.577464788732394

70738,5,0783116926,"Saw this movie for the first time on t.v. in the late 1980's when I was in my late twenties. I can't say enough about how well this movie was made and has held up. It's an R rated, bonafide "" haunted house "" movie that creeps up on you like few others of it's genre could. No CGI, no grandiose effects. Just a great story, solid plot and talented actors. Before you watch this movie, check all the lightbulbs in your house and make sure they light up. You'll appreciate that advice a lot more after you watch. I definitely recommend this movie.",1510099200,,544,4.240384615384615

70740,5,0783116926,"""The Changeling"" is not ""The Haunting,"" ""The Innocents,"" or any of a number of fine stories (and films) that leave one in doubt whether the events are supernatural or manufactured by an overwrought mind. This is a no teasing, straight-ahead, ripping good ghost story. By this point in their careers neither George Scott nor his wife and co-star Trish van Devere had to make this movie. One imagines that one day their agents sent them a script, they read it, they agreed it was a damned good story, and for that reason just did it with a director whom they trusted. Both actors play their characters with just the right balance of skepticism, bewilderment, grief, fury, and, finally, terror. (The movie's far better for the fact that they don't exercise the clich of falling in love, which would only have slackened the tension.) All the actors, mostly Canadians (such as John Colicos and Barry Morse), are perfectly cast. A standout is elderly Melvyn Douglas, whose role could itself have been a clich: he is riveting whenever he's onscreen. All the other values are in place: the superb musical score, the cinematography, the locations, the production design. The movie is as much a mystery as a thriller, and the undercurrents become deeper, more unsettled, more suspenseful, and more horrible: to pinch from Henry James, the screws just keep turning until the thing bursts wide open. This is no cheap gore-fest. A movie this frightening doesn't have to be.",1509235200,,1460,4.91497975708502
70741,5,0783116926,"I have loved this movie since I was 13. I just showed it to my husband, who is a total horror movie buff, and he's thanking me profusely for showing him a movie that actually made the hair on his arms stand up. This film is perfect.",1508803200,,232,3.9574468085106385
70742,5,0783116926,This is by far one of my favorite scary movies. This is an old school kind of movie that refrains from graphic violence and nudity with only minimal language. I bought this when I could not find it to rent on Netflix or Amazon. This will be part of our Halloween movie lineup for years to come!,1508716800,,294,4.175438596491228
70743,2,0783116926,"i watched this movie under a recommendation that it was one of the scariest thrillers ever made (without all the gore of a horror movie) and i am not into gory movies,

however this movie is not a thriller, its a drama! a total B movie, its a little sad at the beginning, and the sadness trickels through all the way to the end,

but its really long and overly drawn out could have been cut way down and still made sense, overall its an ok movie to watch just to say you've seen it, but do not expect to be scared, if you can stomach it all the way through,

i started loosing interest and almost stopped it half way through but stuck it out to the end and now i can at least say ive seen it,

and a bit of extra info....this is very loosely based on a real life story that happened in Denver Colorado many a moon ago and that was the other reason i wanted to see it,  as im a colorado native, this story though is not set in denver, but there is a big reference to the house, family, and a major park in denver called cheeseman park that used to be a cemetery later changed into a public park, they changed the name of the park in the movie to chessman park, but if your a colorado/denver native you will get the plug.",1508112000,,1219,4.020661157024794

70755,5,0783116926,"Since its inmediat release, this film achieved a cult status. Its solid script, the crucial tension, the employment of visuals, the superb performance of George C. Scott, the inner tension this house gives us, the resource of the wheel-chair as lethal weapon and the sequence of the human chase (made me remind the renowned sequence from Kubrick's The shining), the prodigious camera-handle of Medak and the smart connection between a psycho-thriller and an unforgiven homicide challenging the major political force in town, are by themselves pivotal factors that make of this picture a referential at the moment to think about the best exponents of the genre.

The rest of the film runs for you my dear reader. I won't tell you what the script is about. It would be a major crime!!!

Just watch it and probably you will treasure it as I do.

PD. Maybe I'm speculating but I think there is a narrow resemblance between this script and the final of ""The fall of the house of Usher""",1498521600,,980,4.752941176470588

70757,4,0783116926,A very scary thriller. Relies on great writing and acting rather than on gruesome special effects .  This one will send shivers down your spine but won't disgust you with images of detached body parts .  Stands the test of time well if you don't expect it to be placed in contemporary times but rather back in the 70's and 80's.,1497139200,,328,4.360655737704918

70797,5,0783116926,"By far the best scary movie I have seen, and I like scary movies.  I saw this movie in a theater in 1980.  It actually, literally, made the hair stand up on the back of my head.  I was an Army captain then, and I could actually feel the hair on the rear of my scalp poofed out.  That had never happened before, and nothing else has done it since.  Later in the movie it happened again, and I asked my girlfriend sitting next to me to confirm it.  She was amazed.  Then I was deployed to Korea and watched the movie again on VHS alone in my BOQ.  It poofed my hair in back again.  I've seen it several more times over the years, mostly showing it to others, and it doesn't do that to me anymore, but I think I can promise that if you give this movie a chance, watch it quietly and without interruptions, it will cook your grits.

70801,5,0783116926,"This is not the Clint Eastwood's Changeling. It is director Peter Medak's horror movie.
 This movie owns a great deal from the Hictchcock's <Rebbeca> I guess and also the movie should have been influenced to James Wan's <The Conjuring>.
 The movie <The Conjuring> has a woman paranormal investigator who helps the family to solve the problem with haunted house and ghosts who posses the house.
 In this movie also the woman helps the haunted house that just bought by this old man who is a composer. He constantly hears things, very loud banging sounds, child's screaming. He even see things. When he fills the water in the bathtub, he sees the image of a naked boy's face inside the water. Also when he sees the mirror, it shattered and inside the mirror, a man's face appears and part of the mirror flies and sticks on his face.

There are many scary things used by many tool.
 Among them is a ball that was belonged to his dead daughter by a car accident. One day it rolled from the second floor and came to him. He was upset because he put it inside the box for years. He didn't wanted to think about his dead daughter anymore. He threw it away into the river.
 When he came back home, it was back at the house and it rolled down from the second floor again. Just like Jim Carry's movie <THE MASK> When Jim threw the mask away it kept came back.

Another very scare thing was the wheelchair which was used by the crippled son who was killed by his father (The former family who lived in this house).
 It suddenlt rolled and attacked the old man (George) and that was shown by the wheelchair's point of view. It was so scare to death. You just have to see that scene.

The meanning of the title is this.
 There was a rich family lived in this house before. The father was a mean guy and had a crippled son. He wanted a perfect child so he drowned him inside the bathtub and burried him in the house. Then he adopted another boy and made him his substitutional son. That's why the title changeling was named.

The old man who bought the house played by George C. Scott found this out by research after research and finally goes to the man who is a substitutional son who is now a very rich man. He tells him that story. He tries to deny it.

One day when there is a fire in George's house, that substitutional son comes to the house. I think he is ready to face the real son who died by his father (who adopted him as well) The real son took his life (The substitutional son) and the house burnt totally with the subtitutional son.

George was survived and the case was closed.

The ending scene is something you will never forget and I can see why so many critics are talking about this film as the most well made supernatural horror film ever made.

Peter Medak is an England director who made only a handfull of movies so far. Most of his works are about gangs, betrayal, brutality.
 His other fine works includes <Romeo is Bleeding><Let him have it><The Krays> and not so great movie <Species 2>
 This movie was an exception. I don't think he will ever make another horror film. It is just not his genre. But the movie was a masterpies in this genre.
 And also this film was made in America for the first time for the director.

70820,5,0783116926,"I have to say that ""haunted house"" type movies are some of my very favorite if they are done well. This one is certainly no exception! George C. Scott (Patton) does a wonderful job in the lead role as a musician that moves into an old ""historical society"" mansion and after a few days begins to feel/hear unexplained occurrences. He directs his unanswered questions at the ""society"" itself with little help at first, then he befriends a woman working there and the two investigate further They uncover something that was ""buried"" in the past, but now it wants to tell it's story and seemingly nothing will stop it from doing so!!
A truly excellent thriller from start to finish. I loved this movie and it looks good here on the DVD. HBO films has done a good job on it, but special features are a bit skimpy. This DVD is 10 years old, so hopefully in the near future we get a real nice and clean Blu-ray edition with more added features including a theatrical trailer, of which I think I have only seen once.

70846,5,0783116926,"I  Never thought that I would ever see dramatic actor George C Scott in a horror movie ever! I have to say he gave the role a certain air of authenticity, that made his character believable, and the movie itself less cheesy. He plays a professor/composer who loses his wife and daughter in a tragic car accident. He thenrelocates to a small town to start a new life. He ends up renting this huge mansion that has a history and life of it's own. The house is haunted by a dead boy who died many years ago and is connected to George thru his daughters trgic death and a toy ball she once owned. George is drawn into this mystery along with the real=estate women who found him the historic mansion. There is a slight nod to the movie ""The Haunting"", with the loud banging noises heard every morning at 6am. The chase is on then to solve the mystery aided by clues from the dead child, Mediums and tracking the history of the house .Some scary moments, but mostly good clean fun, just watching George embrace this role whole-heartedly. His real-life wife Trish Van Durvere  also stars as his land-lady, and partner in ghost-busting. I love this movie and had hunted it down for a long time . I watch it over and over again and still enjoy it. The Angelina Jolie movie The Changling  is not an up-dated version of the original. That's a totally different story sans ghost.",1436918400,3,1367,4.438247011952191

This house was demolished in the early 80's to build a high rise condominium.  Source: ""The Henry Treat Rogers Mansion""  - http://hauntedcolorado.net/

70881,5,0783116926,"John Russell (George C Scott) , a grieving composer who is trying to piece his life back together after losing his wife and daughter in a horrific car accident, rents a large, turn of the century Victorian-era mansion. As expected, strange, inexplicable things begin to occur and while trying to investigate a strange noise, John has a disturbing vision of a drowned boy. He soon realizes he is not alone in the house. He begins his own investigation on the house's history and its previous owners and uncovers a shameful tale of murder and deceit while the ghost of a young boy longing for justice (or revenge) will not rest in peace until the truth is known.

Directed by Peter Medak, ""The Changeling"" is a gripping, thought-provoking thriller. It succeeded in creeping me out in several sequences thanks largely to the film's chilling atmosphere. Who would have thought the sight of a ball bouncing down a flight of stairs would have been an effective sequence in a horror film? The setting/house is majestic; a perfect location for this kind of tale- huge, vacant, ominously dark and draped with perfectly placed cob-webs. Despite this grand structure, the film is very modest technically speaking and is a far cry from the loud, more visceral horror films that would follow it. There are no loud and flashy special effects and there is hardly any blood on display. Subtlety is key here and ""The Changeling"" went back to the basics - think ""The Haunting"" (1963), and uses sounds, objects and mystery to try to scare you and for the most part, it succeeds. There are no moments where the viewer will be looking away or covering their eyes, but don't be surprised if you have to turn on some lights immediately after viewing. We get the usual creaking doors, creepy staircases, ghostly voices but at the heart of it all is a mystery, and it is this mystery that had me transfixed. The film is a bit slow moving but ""The Changeling"" is a product of its time. It takes its leisurely time in telling us the story but the journey is satisfying. It is also a great opportunity to see some great actors from another era showing us what they do best. George C. Scott is great here. His performance is an emotional one, subtle but self-assured. The man was able to say more with just one look than many others can achieve using their entire body. Also in the great cast is veteran actor Melvyn Douglas in one of his last film roles and Scott's then wife, Trish Van Devere who plays John's friend and realtor, Claire Norman. This film, along with Scott and Van Devere won Genie awards (for the non Canadians, just GOOGLE ""Genie Awards' if you want to know what I'm referencing).

If you are in the mood for a good, old-fashioned murder mystery with a supernatural twist, ""The Changeling"" is wholeheartedly recommended. It grabbed a hold of my attention right up until it's riveting, fiery conclusion. Despite its slow pacing, it remains a good, solid, well-made ghost story and worth owning.

The picture quality of the DVD is pretty good as is the sound. The only extra are actor bios and that is pretty much it. Despite its reputation of being a classic of the genre, I do not foresee any mind-blowing, comprehensive Blu-ray/DVD releases of this film anytime soon, so this version is mostly likely it. Get it.

Thanks to a skilled cast and an underrated director (Peter Medak), ""The Changeling"" handles these tropes with great style and subtlety and makes the entire film rise above cliche.  The only film I can think of that deals with the ghost of a dead child more effectively is Guillermo del Toro's ""The Devil's Backbone.""  If your taste in ghost  / haunted house thrillers  leads you to prefer subtle visuals (such as Jack Clayton's 1962 film ""The Innocents"") rather than explicit shocks and blood and thunder, then ""The Changeling"" is for you.  The seance sequence is hands down (no pun intended) the best-staged and the creepiest of any that I've seen.",1423267200,,935,4.8734177215189876

70901,5,0783116926,"Mystery, corruption, and murder most foul.

A good ghost story is just that: a story.  You have to think about it, and pay attention.  It isn't some silly vingette of a girl crawling out of a well, or a kid barfing up ectoplasmic clouds.  That crap is for amateurs.  If you can see the ghost, you've already kind of blown the whole thing.  So what makes it so scary?  It isn't the ninety percent of information we already know that matters, its that last ten percent we can't figure out that bothers us.  Maybe we do figure it out, and in doing so, regret that were not satisfied with only the ninety.

And it keeps on bothering us long after the movie is over.  It bothers George C. Scott, too, who figures things out pretty early and sets out to make things right as best he can.  Unfortunately, forces beyond his control are set to stop him; aside from the ghost itself, political forces who would rather see the past buried and local authorities who don't want their boat rocked do their best to stop him.  When was the last time you saw a genuine ghost story with political intrigue?  Better yet, when was the last time you saw a scary ghost story at all?  I'll bet it didn't have nearly as frightening a seance as the one in this movie.  Watch it with a blanket covering you.

Sidestepping the obvious debate about what makes a scary story frightening, what we do not know is always more frightening than what we do know, and when we feel a loss of control is when things are at their creepiest.  But worst of all is the lingering terror of the loss of security, when our sense of normality is shattered.  Parents are supposed to protect children.  Our homes are supposed to be safe.  Right?  When these things are broken, we forever ask why they had to be.  The answer may be there, but the how never satisfies us.  It has to be the why.

The answer, as it is for Scott's ghost, is the same.  Sometimes there are no answers, and the wrath of the ghost of a child is our outlet.  The ghost is simply doing, in death, what we cannot in life.  And can we blame him?  That, perhaps, is the scariest of all.

Better go get that blanket.",1420329600,,2138,4.288220551378446

70921,5,0783116926,"George C. Scott meets the ghost of a little boy tied to the house where he is living, who wants the truth to come out about what happened to him in that house. Scott gives a subdued performance which really works well in a ghost story. He plays a composer who has rented the Seattle house after losing his wife and daughter in a car crash. He is grieving plus he is sensitive, just what the boy ghost needs in order to reveal things.

The screenwriters did a lot of parapsychology research and it shows in this film. Instead of gruesome, bloody scenes, the scenes instead are things which shouldn't be able to happen but are, for the ghost to get Scott's attention. These are creaking doors opening on their own, balls bouncing on their own, water running which no one turned on, windows breaking for no reason, etc., A heck of an actor was needed for small things to build with such menace and Scott was that actor. It all gathers momentum until we can see a bath, running water, fire and all becomes clear. We do get a complete flashback to what the ghost wants to tell and that is terrific.

I've seen this film maybe a dozen times and each new time I watch it...even though I know what happens...I still get scared. I think it has mostly to do with the overall atmosphere and sound. This is a well acted, very well made, truly scary film. Highly recommended.

It is a terrible shame that this film has not seen release in HD yet. It is nearly universally lauded, won the Canadian award for best sf/horror (its a Canadian film), and it remains somewhat obscure.",1414627200,,690,4.556451612903226
70946,3,0783116926,"A movie is only as ""scary"" as the viewer sees it to be. What ""frightens to death"" one person may ""bore to death"" another. This film is not what I would call a particularly 'scary' movie. it's part mystery, part ghost story. One of the main reasons I bought this film was because I really like George C. Scott. With him in the picture, I knew that it would probably be a decent story and I was right (Again, in my opinion). George C. Scott moves into a house that 'hates people'. He hears many strange sounds, particularly loud banging throughout the house, reminiscent of the movie ""The Haunting"". He later finds a secret attic where a murder of a young boy took place. So, the mystery was who was the boy and why did his father murder him? Hence, we later understand what is meant by ""The Changeling"". I won't disclose anything else other than to say it was a nice little mystery and I certainly would watch it again. But I did not find it at all the least bit scary. This film has been on some internet lists as one of the top 20 scariest films ever made. I would never have put this movie in that list, but then again, I can't think of any movie that ever truly scared me. (""The Conjuring"" was another film that was critically acclaimed to be very scary, but I did not see it scary because it was too predictable). So, it was a good story but nothing particularly memorable. I also was not satisfied with the ending, but that's just me. So, if you like George C. Scott as I do, then I'd recommend it. I also found it amusing that this film was made in 1979, five years prior to his role as Scrooge in the TV movie 'A Christmas Carol' where he once again finds himself with ghosts. Once again, his presence as Scrooge made the movie well worth watching every Christmas. I hope you enjoy this film but don't get your hopes up as a particularly frightening story.",1414627200,,1863,4.295454545454546

70964,5,0783116926,"Just in time for Halloween, I decided to recommend this little gem from 1980. They really don't make them like this anymore, and it's a shame. Noted for its dark intensity, George C. Scott turns in one of his most powerful and sensitive performances as a grieving father and husband. His wife and daughter are tragically killed in a freak accident and buries himself in his work. He moves halfway across the country to get away from his grief, and is a composer/music professor at the local university and decides he needs to focus on his music, so he rents a creepy Victorian mansion. The house is beautiful to look at, large and imposing, it's very easy to get lost. A little too lost it seems. While it seems just what John needs to take his mind off his grief, there is something lurking in those darkened halls.

The movie features a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, especially the piano pieces, full of such sadness and the ache of a broken heart, that the lingering ghost of a child is drawn to it. Soon John begins to notice things. Keys of a piano being played on their own, cold drafts where there should be none, and the feeling that he is being watched. It's enough to make you start peering over your shoulder. Mind you, the movie is not gory or bloody. The creep factor is a spell conjured by the splendid acting of Scott, the dark, muted colors, ghostly echoes of windows shattering, doors slamming, balls bouncing downstairs of their own accord, and that soundtrack. John begins to compose a tune and soon finds out it already exists.

The second half of the film begins the ghost hunt, and John is lured upstairs to a room long forgotten in a closet. He tears the wall paper away and starts pounding. Soon he discovers a child-sized wheelchair and music box. The room belonged to a child. With the help of Claire, a local historian, he sets out to find out what happened to the tragic child who is growing angrier by the day, not satisfied with John's halfhearted attempts at solving the mystery.

If you find yourself growing bored, stop! There's a seance coming. And it's a doozy. The ghost child is lured downstairs by the medium who begins to piece together the tragic events of little Joseph's death. John is stunned and understandably reluctant to pursue the case further. But Joseph will not be denied. In comes the creepy, eerie grave digging as John seeks to find the child's scattered bones. It's dark, visceral, haunting, and so utterly sad that you find yourself weeping for Joseph and urging John to find him closure.

One of my favorites, I have always enjoyed watching this on a dark and stormy night. It will send shivers down your spine and if it doesn't, well, maybe check your pulse!

Five stars for the good, old-fashioned ghost story that doesn't need buckets of blood, and gratuitous sex and violence. Instead, you get chills from the ordinary. Doors shutting on their own, echoes of small hands pounding against the bathtub, dimly lit corridors, cold drafts, seances and wheelchairs moving by themselves. Still gives me chills!

Highly recommended for your DVD collection and one of my favorite George C. Scott performances.

71060,4,0783116926,"Yes, this is another haunted house/spook story.

But before you allow that to deter you, listen up. The Changeling is actually creepy, it actually has a plot, and it soaks up enough originality and characterization to keep you enthralled. It manages to blend supernatural and mystery elements convincingly.

 We start out with a tragedy that puts you in a damp and dark mood, thinking to yourself, ""Gee life really does suck for some people more than most."" We then continue on that quiet pace and follow the poor soul to his new home, where he meets a woman who becomes an integral part of the story. What we don't see is excessive CGI, corny oddball cast members coming out of the walls, dripping blood, crazed religious nuts...we just see an old fashioned ghost story that hasn't been told the same way before or since, with nice and eerie undertones peppered throughout.

Through lighting and sound effects, this movie became more ""haunting"" than any CGI laden supernatural flick could be. The old subtle way always works best -- I wish Hollywood would pick up on that.

 Now this isn't to say that anything really new happens in The Changeling through events. The regular ghost manifestations, things happen - there was no new twist on the old ghost and ghoul theme itself. One of the uses is of the wheelchair - very tasteful. Probably the thing that sticks out the most about the movie after a few years of not seeing it.

George C. Scott acts out as John and he shines in his role. He was an outstanding actor who passed away in 1999; he will be missed. Not only was he in this genre role, but you may also remember him as the creepy and deadly John with the eye-patch in Firestarter, and the Lt. in The Exorcist 3. Trish Van Devere plays Claire but she's definitely a supporting actress here and nothing else. She helps guide the plot along for Johns' direction, and when anything eerie happens and she's around she usually leaves. Her reaction, while some modern viewers may view as cowardly, is more mainstream on how a person really would react, and I enjoy seeing realistic responses in movies like this; makes it more real and deeply felt.

 The director, Peter Medak, is the same man who did Species 2, believe it or not. How things change. Let me try to recapture Species 2 in my head and judge it...

Oh and by the way...for those of you who say this movie would be great today if it were remade with the current special effects available...do me a favor. Blindfold yourself and take a nice walk in the middle of a busy highway. This movie - this plot! - was NOT MADE FOR EFFECTS. This would ruin the movie and I hope to God at least some people can figure this out. If we did that today this movie would be cheapened and I don't want to see that happen. We don't need another ""The Haunting"" on our hands. You may like the remake, fine, no problem, but the original haunting was in a different breed than the Changeling. Well...wait a minute, maybe it wasn't. (sigh) Actually I did hear that The Changeling is having a remake for TV...will this blasphemy never end??",1379635200,,3083,4.528776978417266

Scott again and doubly-so to see the then venerable Melvyn Douglas who topped a varied career of light comedy parts, mostly, with a series of excellent supporting performances in serious fare. Trish Van Devere, Scotts wife until his death, holds up the female end of the lead  team quite well. For the most part this is a very controlled film with nothing in the way of the outlandishly ghoulish effects striven for by current directors.  It is  very much in the traditional pattern of Haunted House plays and films, with a familiar pattern of ghost manipulations of reality. It would be easy not to get in the spirit of things, no pun intended, but if you can do so, there is a quite decent experience available here.

71078,5,0783116926,"This movie is a horror masterpiece. George C. Scott's character loses his family in a horrific and emotionally-debilitating accident which he watches and is powerless to stop. He moves into the huge house to recover, rest, and get back to his work.

Soon after he's in the house, strange things start happening. Clearly an entity is trying to communicate with him, but why?

The reasons are made clear in a shocking end where the real bad guy faces his just deserts, and a spirit is put to rest.

This might be too intense for little kids, but teenagers will love the waiting-to-be-scared moments.

The best thing about this movie is that it manages to have that masterful story and huge scares all without blood and gore. The scare is from the simple things and the things you don't see. Your imagination is far worse than any special effects blood bath.

71088,1,0783116926,"The Changeling is a good solid horror movie. Not the greatest horror movie, just really good. The reason I gave it one star was to convince you to give it a chance. And I will argue both sides. I really would give it four stars, but who wants to read that review? The facts are- if you want blood and gore, go someplace else> 1 star.  If you want fast paced action> 1 star. If you are easily bored> 1 star. The movie needs room to breathe and grow, and here lies it's strength. The set ups are truly wonderful. The opening pre- credit tragedy that sets the tone of the film is done with style and taste. The helplessness of Scott's character, emphasized by his being trapped by the glass walls of the phone booth and his family, sets up the connective tissue of child loss that will bring him to THE HOUSE. Another key element, his daughters ball, is quietly introduced here as well. When we get to the house it is a wonder of set design and texture- it feels right. Sound design and music must also be given hefty credit. Both are superb. As I said- fast pace and action is not a strong point here and it takes some time for suspense to build. From the solo note played on the piano AFTER Scott walks away to the set piece of the film- the seance and it's aftermath. It is one of cinemas most chilling sequences as Scott plays back the recording and hears what REALLY was going on. (CHILL FACTOR> 10 It still creeps me out to this day). And there are one or two more subtle scares that also brought the house down when viewed. (YES I ACTUALLY SAW THIS IN A THEATER WHEN IT WAS RELEASED)
Unfortunately, what other reviewers have said is accurate here. The film breaks down in the last third and becomes a muddled whodunit. And yes, the wheelchair scene did have me and the audience laughing hysterically.(an unintentional problem. I still cringe thinking about it (ALMOST A DEAL BREAKER> 10) But in my opinion all the good (and scary) moments in this movie far out weigh the bad. Go in with an open mind. This is a far more effective/scary/and well written film than ALL of the Paranormal Activity films combined.

A older man (Scott), has his family killed in a bizarre auto mobile accident. Upon moving into a new home, he realises it maybe haunted. Are the ghosts his dead family, or something more sinister?

Is it any good?

This film feels very similar to the Japanese Horror classic `The Ring' in many ways, and likely a very strong influence. A child, a well, and a mystery tale as to why our character is being haunted, and uncovering the clues. Scott delivers a fine performance as the grief stricken father, as does the rest of the cast. I did find it amusing that after losing his family he decides to move from his small apartment and into an old Victorian mansion with a gazillion rooms. Seriously, that is asking for trouble! Great film with an excellent, jaw dropping ending. Even though the film was made over 22 years ago, this film is very unnerving and still packs a punch in the thrills department.

Best bit?

`Joseph, Why did you die?'. George C. hires a medium to flush out the the ghosts with eerie consequences. One of the great scenes in horror movie history.

It doesn't insult your intelligence, has no gratuitous violence, gore, sex, very little raunchy language, and is still PLENTY scary. It creeps me out every time I watch it, and my one sister won't watch it again because it gave her nightmares. It's scary in a ghosty way, and has some hard-hitting shockers thrown in.

It's about a guy who loses his wife and daughter then moves into this house that is haunted by the spirit of a boy from 1900. From there on it gets creepier as the boy is trying to communicate with him from the dead and reveal the horrific stuff that happened to him so the guy could solve the case... The seance scene was so creepy.

It's got that old school quality to it and real atmosphere/genuine creepiness you don't find in the movies of today. Overall, i'd say it's a solidly good movie and i'd recommend any horror fan or fan of scary movies to buy it.

71144,5,0783116926,"I have been a practicing professional psychic since 1992, and anytime I hear of a psychic movie I just have to watch it, to see if nothing else how close they come to reality.  Some movies are so hokey and bad that I laugh out loud!  But this one for the most part nails it.  The seance scene in particular was fairly well done, and it was refreshing to see ordinary people who are older as the psychic and her husband, instead of some 22 year old boob-job blonde and her gorgeous-guy boyfriend.  The automatic writing is exactly how I started out, where it's too big and runs off the page; my one quibble with this scene is that the woman who's the psychic would most likely have been past that early stage with automatic writing by now.  The movie was also accurate in that sounds you can't hear with your ears can be heard later on recording devices, though not always.  I've never had anything shatter, but I suppose the scriptwriter had to throw in something dramatic.  The wheelchair chasing Trish Van Devere was a bit much.  I've never seen anything like that.  But everything else was pretty spot on.  In particular the ghost communicating through the water was very accurate, as symbolism is the language on the Other Side, not words. I'm often asked why ghosts don't just speak to people.  I always answer this way: ""If you speak nothing but English and you're with people who speak only French, expect communication problems.""  In other words, they talk how they talk, not how we talk, and unless they're very experienced, they use the language that exists over there, which is symbolism, not words, which are what we use here.

George C. Scott as always is a very fine actor, and there is noticeable chemistry between him and Trish Van Devere.  It was especially refreshing that there wasn't the same old tiresome fall-in-love story.  They were a man and a woman who were friends.  How unusual!  The house was perfectly cast and had just the right feel to it.  It was nice to see an older actor in the lead role who was a highly accomplished musician in the film; classical music is so little heard in movies.  I liked it that Scott's character John was both intelligent and open-minded, and I totally agreed with the guy at the college who said that most people who claim to be psychic aren't at all.  Becoming a true psychic requires an awful lot of work and an awful lot of failures before you get there, and even then you're still apt to misinterpret at times.  But still, overall, compared to some of the really RIDICULOUS psychic movies I've seen, this one was pretty close to the way I've actually experienced being psychic myself.",1310515200,,2650,4.572033898305085

I love the fact the story line is also a mystery...this adds to the suspense that dominates throughout from beginning to end. I can honestly say this is a Classic and proves you do not need tons of blood and guts to make a movie interesting or scary.  I love the old haunted mansion appeal that coincides with the history of houses built in the 1800s. My favorite scene is the sceance when G.C.S is trying to find the source of the spirit that keeps him up nights and likes piano.  I found the story very sad as well and cry every time I watch it.

71151,5,0783116926,"The Changeling is a perfect choice if you're in the mood for a creepy classic ghost story. The haunting is believable and coherent--the story behind the death of the child now prowling the mansion as a ghost is touching, terrible, and truly frightening. The way that the ghost makes himself known is consistent with his life and his death. Everything hangs together in a strong narrative that drives forward unnervingly; the terrible answer to this puzzle is cohesive and believable.

In fact, Changeling has almost all the element to create the prototypical ghost story. It opens with a tragedy that makes the one survivor ""open"" to the other side through his grief. It takes place largely in a slight decrepit old house, a house that is bound to have history, good and bad. Russell is intelligent and artistic, driven to track dowm a seemingly meaningless banging of pipes, which is later revealed as central to the ghost's communication. The ghost is looking for resolution, and cannot rest, tormented until the answer to his death is found; just a boy, he cannot imagine why something so awful had been done to him.

Changeling is also a wonderfully quiet movie. The story pushes on relentlessly, but without spectacular effects or a single ""action"" scene; action in this movie is a scene involving a psychic engaged in automatic writing. It is the wanting answers and wanting the ghost to find release that drives the movie, not noise and special effects.

This is a perfect addition to any rainy afternoon creepfest, preferablyAutumn or Winter.",1285632000,2,1550,4.953846153846154

When he investigate the cause of the sound. He sees a ball bouncing down the staircase hitting each step as it comes down. upon examining the ball he realizes that it's his dead daughters ball wich was put away by him after his daughters death. He picks up the ball and drives to a bridge and throws the ball in the water. When he arrives back at home he enters the door and heres the same thumping sound as before. He looks up the staircase and sees a ball bouncing down every step again. when the ball finally rests on the floor in front of him. He notices that it's the same ball that he had thrown away earlier.

As fans of good psychic thrillers, we find the movie gripping, very well acted, and with a story line that holds your interest throughout. The main character, John Russell, played by George C Scott, takes you through all the emotions of a man who has tragically lost his wife and child and is trying to rebuild his life in a new city. His quest to discover the truth of the strange happenings and phenomena occurring in the house he rents evolves into an unexpected and historically interesting story, and the search for the perpetrator of the psychic happenings in the house keeps the viewer eagerly anticipating what this search will reveal. The ending, focussing on the music box, leaves the viewer with a feeling of continuance - that the story doesn't quite end with the death of the changeling.

My girls are 7, 9, and 11 and I made them sit down and watch this ""old"" movie with me. They're constantly looking through my Netflix queue and asking to watch whatever has the most disgusting cover. I don't think they're ready for ""Dead Snow"" yet.

""The Changeling,"" along with ""The Others"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" have gone over really well. They get all tensed up at the appropriate times, they giggle after big scares, they squeeze your arm, but in the end they're not freaked out and life goes on. And now they have a taste of what a well-made scary movie should be.

Af for content, this is probably the mildest R-rated movie I have ever seen, as it could be run during the daytime on any channel with no edits these days. I'm not sure what the MPAA standards were in 1980, but I don't believe anything in this film would be damaging to kids, unless his/her parents have overprotected and coached them that scary = bad.

A music professor has a family tragedy and moves to another state to start over. There he rents a house, that could easily fit the whole Van Trapp family. What he doesn't know and soon finds out is that there is something lurking in this house, something waiting patiently for someone damaged enough and lonely enough to summon on a quest, if you will, that will bring darkness into light.
I don't believe I should say much of the plot, I find that there are quite a few that have already said a bit too much. I will say though that the movie pulls you in, in the way a good fright night movie should, lots of eery music, strange camera angles, long flights of stairs that end in shadows, and that damn ball ; )
All these things really increase the scary factor and goose bumps will follow. Now if you're looking for a lot of special effects and gore this is not the movie for you. This is a haunted house movie and as with most haunted house movies, ghosts are the prevalent ""monster"" here. There are no CGI effects and yes you have to sit through people actually talking, because this way you will care for the characters and even care for what happens to them.

Scott is amazingly good as the composer/pianist, and with the help of his real life wife (one of 'em!), Trish Van Devere, also an actress, he begins plumbing the mystery of the eerie occurences.

A man named John Russell (George C. Scott) moves into a house.  House turns out to be haunted.  Boring, right?  Well, to my surprise, NO!

This movie is based on events experienced by a real-life writer (named Russell Hunter) while he was living in a mansion.

The story turns into a supernatural who-done-it (or supernatural mystery) which I found intriguing and intellectually stimulating.  You have to watch and listen carefully to follow this mystery.  The key to unlocking this mystery is to know the meaning of the word ""changeling.""

To be sure, there's enough physical action to satisfy thrill seekers.  There's a creepy sance session, disturbing flashbacks, morbid discoveries, and one pi**ed-off wheelchair.  (For me personally, I was never frightened by all this but a creepy atmosphere was well-developed.)

The writers could have gone over-the-top with this movie but they never did.  It takes time to develop Russell's character and the movie as a whole communicates true emotions.

This is a George C. Scott movie.  He gives an interesting and memorable performance.  (In fact, Scott won a Genie award for his performance.)  I have to also give credit to veteran actor Melvyn Douglas who plays a senator with a horrible secret.

There is another character in this movie that's not recognized in the end credits.  It's the haunted house itself!  This eerie house is used to its fullest: creepy hallways, whispers, slamming doors...its presence is always felt.

The background musical score blends in with the movie's eerie images.

Note that the pace of this movie is slow for today's quick-fix crowd but those with patience will be rewarded.

Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2000) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has one disappointing extra.

In conclusion, this is a rare gem of a movie, best described as a supernatural who-done-it.  And don't forget, watch out for that angry wheelchair!!!

The Changeling stars George C. Scott, Trish Van Devere, and Melvyn Douglas.  This movie is a combination of a supernatural ghost story and a mystery that keeps you guessing throughout.  George C. Scott plays John Russell, a music teacher who loses his wife and daughter in an accident involving a car and a truck.  Soon afterward, he moves into an old house to live by himself.  It isn't long before he realizes there is something strange going on.  He investigates various rooms in the house and unravels some family secrets of previous inhabitants of the house dating back to the turn of the twentieth century.  Some further research at the local historical society uncovers even more secrets.  The climax of the movie is violent and over-the-top and is the perfect way to end a great haunted house suspense thriller/mystery.

During this movie you'll never see the ghost.  This movie was made long before CGI effects and that's a good thing.  It's what you don't see that is scary.  This movie will creep you out with its scary atmosphere.  The acting is superb throughout.  The musical score and sound effects are outstanding as well.

This is one of those movies that starts out slow but gets better and better as it goes along.  If you're up for a really good movie that involves a haunted house, a ghost, scary scenes, lies, deception, and a mystery to solve, then I highly recommend The Changeling.",1260144000,3,1698,4.803448275862069

71182,5,0783116926,"This is one of my favorite horror films of all time.  About the only ones I can think of that I like as well are the original ""Halloween,"" and ""The Shining.""  Those two movies are very different films from each other, and from this film, but all three are characterized by one common theme: what really scares you is what you DON'T see.  Somehow, Hollywood forgot this a long, long time ago.  Your imagination, given a little room to work, can conjure nightmares more vivid and more frightening than anything the best art department and visual effects specialists can ever put on celluloid.  If done well, things only need to be hinted at, and then you will fill in the details out of the scrapbook of horrors that you carry around in your head, and you mind will tailor it to your own deepest fears.

Don't get me wrong, visual effects are a true marvel of modern film making, enabling makers of films to achieve effects that their forebears only dreamed of.  Done well and judiciously, this can tremendously enhance a film.  The problem is, these days, almost no one uses this tool judiciously.  It's invariably overdone.  I can't think of a recent ghost story told on the screen where we don't get treated to full, detailed views of the ghost sooner or later.  These days, they always strive to outdo the last film with yet more spectacular stunts, more spectacular effects.  Sometimes it works, but it rarely rises to the level of some of the old films, where the technology was more limited, and this forced them to rely more on the unseen, on suspense, drama, and the talents of the actors and the director.

""The Changeling"" is a movie in the old style.  The Ghost is never seen (except, once his identity becomes known, in a flashback to the scene of his murder), but his ominous presence pervades the film almost from the beginning.  Imagine yourself in the place of John Russell, the main character played to perfection by the late, great Geo. C. Scott.  All alone in this huge, old, dark house, and you begin hearing inexplicable noises.  Before long, you realize there is another presence in there with you.  Do this while watching the film alone, at night, in your own dark house.

One of the scariest scenes I've ever seen in a movie is the scene where Russell hears the rubber ball his deceased daughter once played with bouncing down the stairs.  It comes to rest just outside the door of the room where he was looking at photos of his lost family.  Knowing the ghost has done this, he drives out to a bridge, and throws the ball in the water, and then arrives back home to find the ball bouncing down the stairs straight toward him as soon as he walks back in the door.  You never see anything except a rubber ball, but it almost makes the hair stand up on the back of your neck.  There are other scenes as well done as this too, and like this scene, all depend on the viewer's imagination, but that's why it works.

This is what a ghost story ought to be.",1255737600,,2973,4.483271375464684
71192,5,0783116926,While this movie is hardly jaw dropping horrifying it has a nice atmospheric chill to it.  Probably the most memorable scene in the movie for me was the scene on the stairs with the ball.  I remember seeing a parody of that scene in the movie 'scary movie 2' before I had even seen this movie.  Even as a joke it's kinda creepy.  George C. Scott's acting is quite good. It is good viewing for a chill night in October or anytime you want a good old fashioned ghost story.,1254700800,,471,4.2
71193,5,0783116926,"To this day, I will never understand why this movie isn't more well known. As far as I'm concerned, this is THE best haunted house movie ever made. I saw it on cable waaaaay back in the early 80's as a young teenager, and instantly it became one of my favorite films. Here I am, almost 30 years later, writing this review, and the memory of that first viewing is as clear as if it were yesterday, and I admit, the goose bumps are starting already. A truly creepy, quite scary, and intensly atmospheric film that sucks you right in and builds steadily throughout. This is a perfect example of what a great script, director, and cast can do. There is no need for gallons of blood or shock value. Good old fashioned suspense, and what you DON'T see. You will not be disappointed with this movie. I agree with one reviewer in that the shot of the wheelchair at the top of the stairs still gets me. And the ball bouncing down the stairs. I still hear it when I close my eyes. God, they don't make em like this anymore!!!",1254441600,2,1015,4.291666666666667
71194,4,0783116926,"What I love about this movie is the fact that it doesn't throw a lot of special effects in your face, the story does not get stupid or hokey, and the director does not try to do more than he is capable of.  This is a very modest, smartly written ghost story that delivers more genuine chills than many a big-budget schlockfest.

The thing that impressed me the most when I first watched this movie almost 10 years ago was how AUTHENTIC it is.  I've read a lot of ""true"" accounts of hauntings, and they are never as dramatic as shown in the movies.  The haunting in this movie is very understated; it's mostly just eerie noises and doors slamming.  No horrible apparitions, no blood oozing down the walls, no illogical mess-with-the-audience's-mind funhouse tricks.  The creepiness builds slowly, realistically, and as a result it is much more scary.

I watched it again today, and there are a few things I noticed.  Firstly, George C Scott's acting could best be described as ""subdued.""  Situations that probably would have made me jump and yell and run away, he confronts with a dull blank stare.  He seems unnerved at times (and once he gets angry at the ghost) but never really afraid.  It's interesting that I did not notice this the first time I watched.

The soundtrack is quite overbearing for a movie in which sound plays such an important role.  Several times when George C Scott is alone in the house and he's reacting to something, I could not tell if he was supposed to be hearing the sounds I was hearing, or if they were ""Spooky Noises"" added to the soundtrack in order to enhance the mood.  The inappropriate sound design did not catch my attention the first time I watched, but it seemed very obvious the second time.

I thought the first time I saw it that the ending was too big, and I think so even more now.  Somebody wanted this movie to have a huge Hollywood climax so they spent their budget to burn down the set, and I think it ruins the mood.  The image of the chandelier swinging as Scott climbs the stairs is unforgettable, but my overall impression of the ending is that it drops a big lump of Hollywood cheese on a movie which otherwise would have completely avoided being cheesy.  It is mainly because of the last 10 minutes that I award four stars instead of five.  This is a good movie - perhaps even great - but not perfect.",1254096000,,2357,4.477751756440281

71197,5,0783116926,"Paul Medak's ""The Changeling(1980)"" is one of the best horror films to be made that decade as well as one of the best Hollywood Ghost stories ever told. Unfortunately, the film is virtually forgotten and rarely referenced outside of aficionados who always give this film rave reviews. However, this film is good enough to work well outside of the realms of Horror fandom to rank as good film-making in general.

The film tells the story of a man(George C. Scott) who is recovering from the loss of his wife and daughter by moving into an old house by himself. Soon upon arriving he is beset by ghostly sounds and occurences that get increasingly more eerie as the film progresses. He eventually discovers a hidden room within the house that contains a terrible secret and thus begins a fine mystery where the audience is as much the detective as Scott is.

""The Changeling"" benefits largely from an intelligent and thought provoking script that is both emotional as it is terrifying, as complex as it is intriguing. There are twists for sure but they are carefully built and the pay off is something else.
The acting is uniformly fine by a cast of professionals led by Scott, Trish Van Devere(Mrs. Scott in real life"")as a woman that aids Scott in the mystery and Melvyn Douglas in one of his last roles as a politician with a shady past.(Douglas' film debut was a horror film:James Whale's ""The Old Dark House(1932)"")

Medak really handles the film's scares adequately focusing more on the power of suggestion that more visceral terror and the movie becomes that much more terrifying because of that choice. Not that all scares are within the mind as the film has some excellently concieved jump scares and a particularly exciting climax.
The seance segment is in particular a classic Horror scene not to be missed!

The film is a must for the Horror fan and for anyone who enjoys a good mystery and a decent scare. The DVD is bargain priced and highly reccomended for intellectual viewers who prefer they're Horror coupled with intelligence.",1249171200,2,2043,4.795454545454546

A thoroughly enjoyable experience. I would recommend it to lovers of suspence/thrillers.,1248048000,,382,5.278688524590164
71199,5,0783116926,"Recently widowed composer, John Russell, moves back home to Seattle to take up a teaching post at the local university as well as focus on his music.  With the help of Claire Norman of the historical society, he rents an enormous, old house where he will be afforded both the space and seclusion needed to carry on with his work.  The house, which is supposedly free of any past, significant ""incidents"", seems, at first, to be a perfect choice but soon, minor inexplicable events starts surfacing until John finds himself fully submerged in the house's horrible past and he is left with no other choice but to help the tormented soul that haunts it avenge his murder 70 years earlier. I remember seeing this movie in 1980 and I remember just as vividly being scared witless that night.  I was 14 at the time and knee deep in my love of all things horror, regardless of the panic that would descend the moment bed time came. Not having seen this movie in many years, I watched it again this past weekend with a friend who'd never even heard of it and I couldn't believe that it chilled me to the bone the same way it did 29 years ago.  This movie is a lesson in horror filmmaking.  Everything is delivered  expertly and efficiently.  All the elements conspire to create a dark and menacing tale of murder and spectral vengeance. The sound editing is amazing (as is the accompanying score by Rick Wilkins) with distant banging, faint whispering and bold metallic screeching, infusing the atmosphere with pure dread.  The camera work is very effective, especially when it's used to show the ghost child's point of view, as he descends stairs, enters rooms or looks down at the partially opened door of his attic room.  The post s&eacute;ance scene is an inspired segment; an unnerving moment that manages to illuminate the story while everything around it is framed with darkness and shadows.  The small cast is excellent, with the late, great George C. Scott, bringing depth and unnerved determination to the character of John Russell.  The underrated Trish Van Devere is also first rate as Claire Norman, the historical society's liaison and John's friend and confidant.  Melvyn Douglas is equally compelling in the smaller role of the changeling, Sen. Joseph Carmichael.  This gem of a ghost story is a wonderfully crafted and executed example of what can be achieved without having to resort to the bombast and bluntness that are the lynchpins of most contemporary horror films.  Younger audiences will most likely dismiss this movie as being cheesy, lame, dated or what have you, no doubt the result of years of being bludgeoned by first rate special effects at the service of fourth rate material and talent.  I would, easily, place The Changeling on a list of top 25 modern horror films, alongside Halloween, The Exorcist, The Omen, Rosemary's Baby, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Black Christmas, Night of the Living Dead, The Shining, Dawn of the Dead and Suspiria, to name a few.

George C. Scott stars, with Van Devere and an aged Melvyn Douglas providing noted supporting roles.

71230,5,0783116926,"The Changeling is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen!  Mind you, I do not make this remark lightly, being an avid fan of horror movies.

After reading some of the few negative reviews that exist on this film, I wondered what constitutes `scary' for these critics.  I myself find the majority of today's horror movies too full of gore and consider many of them to be more gruesome than scary.  That might be what today's audiences are interested in, and for many, perhaps all they can relate to, but I don't see anything quite scary about that.  I think that ghost stories are the scariest of all horror movies because they deal with the unseen dead.  What can possibly be scarier to a human being than that? (Especially, if that entity is directing itself to you, and only you).  The only ones who might take exception to this would be children.  It is easier for their partially developed minds to relate to boogiemen with masks and knives than to the much more intangible and often invisible afterlife.

Then there are those who would not appreciate or would find boring the intellectual dialog used to uncover a murder mystery (i.e. The Uninvited -another great scary thriller).  Hey, not every scene in a scary movie will be scary.  The background of the events is key to understanding why what is happening is happening.  If the story is interesting and the acting is good (as with The Changeling), then viewer interest should be maintained.

One reviewer described the musical warning signals preceding scary occurrences as taking the scare out of the scene.  But I see this technique as a cue that...yes, something scary is indeed about to happen, but we don't know what?  The high-pitched strings used for this effect are in their own right a haunting prelude and I applaud the director for showing respect for his audience.  To me, those haunting preludes add suspense and fright to the film.  --- In any horror movie, a girl can open a door quite suddenly and a ghost can pop out to scare both her and the audience...or a girl can open a door slowly with an eerie creaking sound, alerting the audience that there's a possible fright or danger ahead.  The latter effect has tendency to build tension causing the truly scared to cover their eyes, leaving a slight opening for curiosity sake.  It takes a little more talent and pizzazz to do it the latter way.

The scene where the young girl leaves the safety of her mother's room and lets her curiosity get the best of her is not ruined even though a similar experience has already been described by her mother in the previous scene.  The actual happening of the event coupled with the haunting sound effects that prelude it are indeed full of fright and tension.  There need not always be a sudden shock to scare people.  `Enjoy' the suspense!

I believe this same negative reviewer criticized the overly loud pounding noise that would wake John Russell from sleep.  I should think that one can make a direct association between it and the dramatic drowning scene in the attic.  How loud would you bang if you were being drowned?!

And what about his daughter's ball bouncing down the stairs (the 2nd time).  Yes, we hear the high-pitched cue a split second before it happens, but remember people, not only is the haunting effect still with us, but the message is made clear that something is trying to communicate with this man.  It is not trying to frighten him out of his wits (although it does a damn good job at that too!).  You can't tell me that watching that ball descend from the upstairs darkness is not scary.  Knowing what Russell had already done with the ball in fact makes it doubly surprising, shocking and yes...scary!

I find it difficult to watch this movie alone.  The eeriness of the scene with the close-up of the boy's face in the bathtub is horrifying and I still try to get up the nerve to view it.  The effectiveness of frightening aspects of a film is largely subjective.  This is due to their basis resting in the viewer's imagination.  We all have different levels of imagination and some have none whatsoever.

I think what it comes down to is that films such as The Changeling, The Uninvited, The Haunting and others are just not suitable for today's spoiled audiences.  Directors now give them the gore they've become accustomed to.  The Shining probably marks the bridge from intellectual, suspense, scary - to - gory, woman-chasing, deranged killer...as that classic film contains elements of both.  Hey, it's okay to show a little blood sometimes (or an elevator full of it).  But I'll tell you this...blood and guts can never substitute for suspense, tension, and intangible fright.  But again, I think that gore is what people want to see these days.  Even the kid's video games are full of it.

It is quite possible that The Changeling could have been shot in B&W and been just as or perhaps even more effective.  Some of those classics I've mentioned didn't need color to deliver their superb frightening effects.

I've come to realize that everyone has their own opinion of what is scary, including some who don't get scared of any movie simply because they are not open-minded to the supernatural (perhaps even subconsciously).  For these people no horror movie will suffice.  Okay, that's just not their thing.  But for those with even an inkling of imagination, The Changeling is one creepy, scary movie with a haunting score.  And though its ending does not involve a shocking surprise twist (i.e. Psycho) it is nevertheless quite dramatic and delivers some satisfaction for both the ghost's and the viewer's aching for justice and vengeance (I'll admit though, it would have been more satisfying to see the ghost's father pay for his heinous actions).",1224806400,5,5765,4.733199598796389
71231,5,0783116926,"What makes a good scary movie is a very subjective thing. I have loved this movie since I first caught it on cable, many years ago. I recommend watching it as I did the first time (and probably most times after that): Alone at night, in a dark house, with all the lights off.
Not everyone enjoys a classic ghost story...so many scary movies these days are filled with gratuitous gore, torture scenes, and the like. Not to say that some of those haven't scared the bejeezus out of me, or even been greatly entertaining, but this is not that type of film. This is just creepy and spooky, and lots of fun.
What I can tell you about this is that I often recommended it when I worked at a video store. Whenever parents wanted a scary movie that would be safe/appropriate to show to younger kids or that wouldn't offend or upset the parents of kids staying the night, this was always a hit. And the adults I recommended it to always enjoyed it as well.",1224115200,,946,4.320224719101123
71232,4,0783116926,"[This review is part of my 31 days of Halloween series.]

George C. Scott plays a widower & academic music composer who has lost his wife & daughter to a freak car accident. He uproots & rents a mansion that is...right, haunted. He brings in professional paranormal investigators & has his initial impressions verified, but no answers as to the Why & How to Stop it. He teams up with an available local gal & together they ferret out a tale of a father's betrayal and political intrique.

This is about all I can write about the plot without revealing it. I will say this much: The image of a ""Changling"" is universal, but in this case it is particularly associated with Ireland & stories of the Little People/Fairies. They steal a new born human baby & replace it with an ugly creature called a Changling.

Actually, the movie represents a Changeling in reverse.

This movie is about 40 years old (oh, my god! how old does that make me?!!?) & does not offer the really spectacular special effects typical of this genre today, but the script is so intelligent & the acting so good that it little matters.

71234,4,0783116926,"George C. Scott, Trish Van Devere, and Melvyn Douglas do a fine job in this chilling tale of a haunted house. Scott plays a father and husband that loses his wife and daughter to an accident. He is a composer and he decides to move to a rural community from the city. Scott is offered a Historical Society home to rent. As Scott investigates the reason a child was killed at the home he unfolds an in depth story of a families past. Scott uses all means possible to find out more including a seance. His investigation leads him to a powerful foe. The movie has great atmosphere and subtlety that makes it different than the current bleeders.  The directing and camera work are excellent. It will make you feel as though you were there and it will quite probably give you a chill. This story builds suspense and horror. Well worth owning especially at the current $5.99 price. Good quality DVD and replayability. No extras. If you enjoyed this catch ""Ghost Story"" and ""The Lady in White"".

71236,5,0783116926,"What could I say positive about this movie that hasn't already been said?

It's true that it's an aged movie and by the standards of today's younger audiences it may seem ""lame"" or ""boring"".

But if we take all the 4 and 5 star ratings and stack them up against the 3, 2, and 1, stars we've got 299 positive (this is including mine as of 8-9-08) to 24 negative. That sort of says it all right there.

If you're a connoisseur of the old-school horror/thriller type movies than ""The Changeling"" is right up there with classics like Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" or Hitchcock's original ""Psycho."" Different stories/events ... but the same chills run down your spine.",1218240000,,669,4.605042016806722

This movie is right up there with them and perhaps even a little scarier than Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death (which sure is fun to say...try it, right now, go on, right there at your computer...laughed didn't ya?)

George C. Scott turns in a convincing performance and Trish Van DeVere (who sounds mostly Dutch) is winningly watchable as they play this star-crossed detective kinda couple who have to get to the bottom of the mysteries of the haunted house Scott finds himself living in.  The plot starts to build on a low boil and just ratchets up the scare heat from there.  What one learns when watching this movie is that little kids who die young through no fault of their own (but perhaps the fault of others...don't want to give away a spoiler here you know) and lived in Seattle (but not for long) at the turn of the century will go to any lengths to revenge their death.  If this isn't a truism you have arrived at in life just yet...get ""The Changeling"" watch but just don't watch it alone in a dark dark house on a stormy stormy night.  No, you'll want all the lights on for this one my friend.

Warning, if you are parents of young children especially boys, there may be this scene that you will have difficulty watching if not all together turn you off from watching anymore of the movie.  I was Ok with the remaining 99% of the flick since there are scenes that are so truly scary that you'll be shivering in your justin ropers you will.

Since the flick was made in 1980 there are some effects that will elicit a chuckle which is just fine if your making a comedy, not so much for a horror flick.  George C. Scott's character's wife and young child die, he moves to Seattle and naturally wants to live in this creepy old house that no one has live in for quite a while because well it's creepy and most likely to be haunted.  Well it turns out it is; haunted.  A boy died sometime around the turn of the 20th century and is spending his god-given purgatory of a ghost's half-life trying to revenge his death.  He is one pissed off ghost, he is.

This boy will use others to write just as fast as he can, whisper spooky ghost-like whispering in one of those reel-to-reel recorders (you know the type that all good poltergeist hunters use), shake some chandeliers, do wheelies in a wheel chair, relieve some painful memories in other peoples minds and perhaps the coolest ghost trick of all...make jewlry squirm out of a well-grave soil underneath someone's floor just like an earthworm mind ya.

So if you like to get a kick every now and then getting your pants scared clean off...get this here ""Changeling"" flick.  It's a little part detective story, a little part murder-mystery, a lot part ghost story, even a little part politico conspiracy power and money grab story.  It's a whole lotta scary and gobs of loads of fun.  ...mmw",1215129600,2,3265,4.787878787878788

Curious, he goes about exploring and discovers a locked, hidden door. Eventually getting it open he unravels clues to a young boy's past and gets caught up in searching for answers as to why this spirit is not at peace.

I found THE CHANGELING (1980) to be a gripping haunted house/ghost story for the ages. They don't make horror films like this too often; ones that rely more on good storytelling and chilling atmosphere rather than gore and violence, so I found this movie to be refreshingly entertaining.

71244,4,0783116926,"""The Changeling"" is one of the last great ghost stories that doesn't rely on special effects to supply its creepiness. It was released to relatively no fanfare in 1980, and went mostly unnoticed for many years. I, myself, was only vauguely familiar with the film, but never saw it in its entirety until about six years ago. The late great George C. Scott stars, and he delivers a fine performance as a musical composer who loses his wife and daughter in a freak accident. The story is a mystery as much as it is a ghost story, and the viewer is asked to be patient as the compelling plot unfolds. Like many films from this era, ""The Changeling"" doesn't offer the quick thrill and gore. It's a psychological journey that gets beneath your skin--if you let it.

One of the film's best scenes, (and one of the greatest scenes in any film) occurs during a seance. Explaining the scene here won't do it justice, but it provides a genuine fright without resorting to contrived special effects. If you enjoy a few chills with an intriguing mystery, then ""The Changeling"" will certainly suffice.",1198886400,,1087,4.661458333333333

And though I'm not an overly huge fan of haunted house movies, I really did like this one. It has a great storyline to it, and does keep the audience interested in what's going on in the film. Its really a bit more than just your classic haunted house story, actually. One thing that this film does do, however, is take its time, which isn't really a bad thing, but I do think that the movie couldn't been shorten down a bit, its' almost 2 hours long and tends to get a bit drawn out here and there. And even though me, personally, I didn't really find anything real creepy or too suspenseful in the film, that doesn't mean its bad. At least it does a good job of portraying suspense and mood without trying too terribly hard. The acting is pretty good too, and George Scott does a great job as the main character. Like I said before, besides some of the slow pacing of the film, this one is pretty good. A definite watch for anyone who likes haunted house films.

Freddie you can laugh off as a guy in a rubber mask - pathetic little Joseph and his tiny wheel-chair hidden from the world in the attic by his greedy physician father, a man willing to drown his own child in the bathtub and replace him with a more suitible child in order to hold on to the family fortune... is not.",1187740800,2,829,4.411764705882353

I finally was able to view it years later on HBO and it made every hair on my body stand up! Visually it isn't scary but the symbolisms have a psychological effect on the psyche (e.g. a ball drops down the staircase, George C. Scott picks it up and brings it to a bridge far away and deposits the ball into the water, to his surprise when he arrives back home the same ball drops down from the staricase again). This by far is the best haunted house movie set in a large mansion in the woods outside of Seattle but actually may be in British Columbia. There's something about the Northwest, rain, and classical music that creates the perfect setting for a haunting.

A young boy by the name of Joseph Carmichael is robbed of his future empire and murdered by his own father due to his handicap and returns to possess the mansion he once lived in. George C. Scott stars as John Russell, a music professor/composer who recently lost his wife and daughter in a horrible automobile accident and takes residence in the mansion.

The Changeling is almost at the level of a Hitchcock film - in terms of setting the iconic standard for the scary movie genre to follow. As the plot unfolds, you will spot devices now copied in newer movies - the child ghost and the wheelchair, the innocent ball being bounced down the stairs by a playful unseeing hand, the erratic movement of the camera as the policeman's car overturns, the haunting music box tune layering the musical score - the list just goes on and on.

71267,3,0783116926,"The Changeling is about a recently widowed composer who moves into an enormous mansion, only to find out that there are reasons for its being empty for so long.  The mansion, haunted by the spirit of a murder victim, is old yet beautiful, and empty but full of life.  While it takes a little time before Scott realizes why exactly the mansion is haunted, the audience experiences realization with him.

While there's a subtle sense of suspense within the film, for the most part the audience is left questioning the reasoning for the haunting of only the house.  Once we realize why this spirit remains, we ask ourselves why.  Is the spirit in the house because he cannot possibly leave the place of his murder?  Does the spirit remain for revenge?  Sadly, while there does seem to be resolution, it is unclear and leaves us wanting to know more.  The audience is left with too many questions of the events that took place in the house prior to Scott's entrance.

Despite its flaws, the Changeling does deliver some of that subtle terror that we do not see anymore in film.  Instead of cheap thrills of having something jump out of a dark corner or over-the-top violence, we see abnormal happenings and hear strange sounds (things that are far more terrifying in film for most viewers).  The more desensitized we become to violence, the less we react to it.  Therefore, the Changeling succeeds in its classic scares.

Overall, the film itself gets a 3 out of 5 stars from me.  The DVD, however, gets a 4 because it is preserved well.  If you are looking for special features, though, look somewhere else.",1173312000,3,1604,4.658362989323844

71273,5,0783116926,"This movie came out in the 1970s and it shows a bit...in the cars, the elbow pads on men's suit jackets.  I say that not as a negative, but rather to point out that this film, although perhaps itself based on even earlier movies, sets the pace by which the ""undead revenge"" flick of the last thirty years has measured itself.

The ""undead revenge"" template by now has become quite familiar.  It has surfaced, in various forms in movies from ""Amityville Horror"" and ""Poltergeist"" to the more recent ""The Ring"" ""the Grudge"" ""Dark Water"" ""The Others"" and even ""Silent Hill"".  The theme is usually the same...the angry ghost of a murder victim, usually a child, reaches out to a susceptible adult who then proceeds to investigate the mistery of who killed the child (usually a parent).  Some movies (Poltergeist, Silent Hill) break from the tradition a bit, but the ""ghost who just can't let it go"" is always an element of these stories.  The emphasis in this genre is typically on building suspence rather than violence and gore.  For some reason ""the ghost"" always starts out with little clues of its existence and builds more and more until some kind of destructive or murderous climax.  I always rather wonder why the ghost doesn't just get it all out at the beginning...or for that matter, whether ghosts bother with all the parlor tricks when their haunted houses (or apartment in Dark Water) are sitting empty between spook victims (haunted houses almost inevitably spend at least a decade or so uninhabited to raise the question of ""Why is it so difficult to get anyone to buy such a beautiful house?"")

If you've been running through some of these more recent movies (particularly, the Grudge, Others, Ring and Dark Water, which barely stray from the basic plot of the Changeling), the Changeling will seem to hold few surprises.  That's somewhat unfair, as the Changeling was one of the first movies to use the ""undead revenge"" storyline and remains one of the most effective movies of its kind.  Only ""The Others"" can be said (in my opinion) to be a truly better movie (although ""The Ring"" was perhaps equally good, even if it held few real surprises).

The acting in this movie, although possessed of a typical 70's taste for alternating exaggeration and woodeness is quite good, with a particularly sensitive turn by George C. Scott in an underrated role.  The storyline, although familiar by now, will keep you interested and hooked even if its surprises have been replayed endlessly in more recent films.  Compared to some, some of the backstory might be a little confusing to understand (I've seen this movie several times with different people and some have gotten confused over who is the ""Changeling"" and who is the ghost).

The movie has its overly credulous moments.  Perhaps the worst of these is the ludicrous idea that any major university would have an entire wing dedicated to ""psychic research"".

Overall this movie is highly recommended for those who enjoy a good spooky ghost story.",1167436800,2,3007,4.841796875
71274,4,0783116926,"I hadn't heard about this movie before, until I came across the influences for the Silent Hill videogames. The Changeling was one of them, as well as other movies, books and TV shows. The movie has it's strong point in the story and the time the movie takes to ""explain"" the situations and the people. It's not just scares, it is more of a suspense thriller than a haunted house movie. It has good enough plot twists to make it more interesting than most ""scary"" movies. The comparison to The Shining is unavoidable, but no because of the type of story but because of the great delivery and overall quality of the two movies. A definite must-see, and an ovelooked classic.",1163116800,4,672,4.56198347107438

71276,5,0783116926,"One of the supposed reasons why ghosts remain in this world is that they were murdered, and want the world to know who did it.

So expect a lot of that in ""The Changeling,"" a quiet, compelling ghost story that harkens back to old-fashioned chillers. No ghouls, buckets of blood, chainsaws or serial killers. Instead, this movie relies on outstanding acting, and a timeless feeling that permeates the simple story. And it'll scare the skin off you.

John Russell (George C. Scott) is on a trip with his wife and daughter, when a freak car accident kills them both. Months later, the grieving composer moves to Seattle and rents an enormous historical house, trying to bury himself in his new job. But there are odd sounds and sights in his house -- faucets running, eerie voices the piano clashing, and a boy drowned in the tub.

John becomes increasingly desperate to find out the truth, assisted by the real estate agent who got him the house (Trish Van Devere). With seances, visions and a well under the floorboards, he begins to piece together a terrible crime from many years ago -- and the ""changeling"" that the ghost wants revenge on.

Anyone who wants blood, special effects and lots of screaming had better look elsewhere for their horror kicks. ""The Changeling"" is a very different kind of movie -- think Shirley Jackson, not Stephen King -- where a wheelchair rattling down the stairs is enough to make your hair stand on end. (And do I detect some influence on ""The Ring"" in certain scenes?)

This movie also feels elegant and timeless. Old mossy mansions, horseback riding in damp forests, and a composer trying to overcome his grief. Peter Medak drapes the movie in beautiful visuals, and allows the viewers to get to know the characters before the plot really gets moving.

Then ""The Changeling"" becomes creepy very fast. The plot grows more suspenseful with every scene, building with every new discovery -- a wheelchair, a baptismal medal, and a bathtub -- until something has to erupt. The ghost never appears except in flashbacks -- an appalling murder scene -- but his keening voice can be heard over and over.

George C. Scott gives a pitch-perfect performance as the mild, slightly reclusive John, who is still suffering from his losses and trying to move on with his life. Van Devere comes across as a bit annoying at first, but she also serves as a good counterpoint to Scott, as well as a potential love interest whenever he's ready. Melvyn Douglas also has a good brief role as a politician with a deep dark secret.

Less is more in ""The Changeling,"" a movie whose scares spring from its exceptional scripting, eerie ghost and great acting. Just don't watch this one alone in the house... at night.",1161129600,15,2724,4.744186046511628
71277,4,0783116926,"""The Changeling"" is more mystery than horror film, which is not what I had expected prior to viewing. Nonetheless, this is a good film and I would recommend it. George C. Scott plays John Russell, a classical music composer who loses his wife and daughter in an accident. In an effort to forget this tragedy, he leaves New York City for Seattle. Desiring seclusion in order to practice his compositions, he moves alone into a large, vacant house. It is here that someone, or some thing, begins to contact him. Russell, perhaps realizing he has nothing left to lose, attempts to determine the reason for this. To reveal what or who the Changeling is would be to reveal too much about the movie, so I won't do that here. Unlike some other haunted house films, the ending to this one is moderately satisfactory. The story is told with class, as one would hope for a movie with a classical music composer as it central character. There are no cheap scares, exploitive material such as nudity or gore, and scarcely any bad language. In fact, I'm not really certain why it was rated R and most definitely a re-rating would earn this a PG-13 today. The acting, score and direction are all first rate. I didn't find the movie very scary; however, the suspenseful moments were done well and were fairly effective. The DVD has no extras, though the picture and sound are good. This is worth at least one watch and the price is certainly right.",1159142400,8,1433,4.6015625
71278,5,0783116926,"First of all, I have lost count of the ammount of times I have seen this movie but every time I watch it I get goose bumps. This is how affective the movie is.

George C. Scott (of ""Patton"" fame) plays a composer who rents a house to live in while he teaches and tries to cope with tragedy. Soon the house begins to exhibit strange occurances and Mr. Scott begins to investige the house's history. This is all you need to know about the plot because anything else would ruin the film.

This movie is all about atmosphere. There are no scenes of gore and slaughter like so many big budget horror films nowadays. This film does not need to gross the viewer out. The Changeling simply tells a great story as the viewer learns about the house and witnesses the haunting at the same time as the characters. You are pulled into this film because it entertains and frightens with ease. There is nothing ""in your face"" about the scares.

This film is for fans of the 1960's film ""The Haunting"" or anyone who just enjoys a good ghost story. Don't even bother to rent it because it cheap enough to buy and I guarantee you'll watch it more than once. I have recommended it to many people and I never heard a negative comment.

I have since watched it as an adult and was able to keep it in healthier perspective, although I do have to say it is pretty scary and well done. Watching it many years later, I was surprised that it lacked a lot of the 70's cheese that you see in many films from that era.

71281,4,0783116926,"Simply put, most horror films don't age well at all. When I use the term ""horror"" I'm not refering to the endless supply of slasher and gross-out flicks that have co-opted the genre, I'm speaking of suspensful tales of the unknown. This is the category in which ""the changeling"" resides and I'm happy to say that it's one of the few movies of its type that stands the test of time.

The changeling doesn't rely on special effects or movie monsters to tell its story. A strong script, excellent direction and fine performances have kept this film looking vibrant and feeling valid 25+ years after its initial release. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys suspensful thrillers (Hitchcock) or modern horror films in the mold of ""the sixth sense"". If you're looking for blood and guts or lots of violence you'll need to look elsewhere (thankfully). This film always chooses the high road to deliver its thrills. For those who don't prefer to watch R-rated films I can assure you that this film contains almost no foul langauge, has very little violence, no nudity, and certainly nothing that can be considered ""graphic"" by todays standards. Most modern films rated PG-13 have more disturbing content than this film. If you're an adult viewer looking for suspense and thrills but you want to avoid gore and graphic violence.... the changeling is a good choice!

Not a perfect film, but an excellent effort that holds up well.

71284,5,0783116926,"""The Changeling"" is, to me, what great ghost stories should be. In the tradition of ""The Uninvited"" and the 1963 ""The Haunting,"" it creates a mood, an atmosphere of tension and terror. Films like this work not only at this level but they also provide a mystery behind why the ghost haunts.

I'm sorry but Freddy and Jason are hacker movies that totally dispense with this sort of atmosphere. Even the Amityville horror series and Speilberg's ""Poltergeist"" fall significantly short of this type of film. These latter named films look for ways to create scenes for the sole purpose of suddenly yelling ""boo"" even if they have a story behind the hauntings. The fear created in movies like ""The Changeling"" comes about by bringing the viewer to a place arrived at through the slowly unfolding mystery behind the haunting and then presenting a scene, of interaction with the spirit which is the result of building upon the previous scenes. In other words, the haunting moment comes about by something in the story that calls for it to be there. There's no ""let's have a scary moment to remind everyone that this is a ghost story."" Each bit of information and its haunting moments continues until the journey's end when the mystery is revealed. The linear approach in these scripts suggests the straightforward reading of classic novels. It takes patience with great rewards if we stay with it. They don't resort to the sudden bursts of ""boo"" for its own sake in order to hold our attention. I highly recommend ""The Changeling"" as there are relatively few of this type of filmed ghost story.",1153094400,9,1585,4.805860805860806

71289,2,0783116926,"I had finaly seen ""The Changeling"" after reading some good stuff about it. Haunted houses are always fascinating because the interiors in which the characters move are always ambivalent: doors can protect as well as they can lock up. Long hallways give you a chance to run as much as they can trap you in their labyrinthian web. In the worst case scenario's, the house itself can be possessed and become a character of its own.

Furthermore there is the underlying story which is allways intrigueing: who or what is the spirit that disturbes the piece, why is it doing the nasty things it does, what is its own secret past and what can the characters do to lay it to its final rest. From ""Poltergeist"" to ""The Shining"", from ""Haunted"" and ""The Haunting"" all the way to variations on the subject like ""Ghost ship"" and ""Below"" (A haunted house drifting on or somewhere in the open sea).

In ""The Changeling"" George C. Scott enters a abandoned house after a tragic accident which killed his wife and kid. He is a musician and the house has a wonderul room for him to play the piano and compose new material. To earn a living he teaches at the local university. But soon things happen in the old house. Noisy pounding sounds, a piano key that is struck without a finger is being seen... Soon Scott starts to look into the house's own private history and stumbles upon a family tragedy.

I shall not go into this history myself and not only because there would be spoilers. I won't do it because it isn't really relevant here. Because way before the plot really unfolds I found myself being irritated by the lack of ""good work"" on behalf of the director.

The pounding sounds Scott hears are so loud that they literaly break through the tension, the sounds are almost like a spoiler of their own. Furthermore, because of this ear shattering volume it's impossible to figure out whether the pounding sounds come from the house (and are part of the story) or that they are the results of an all too experimenting movie composer who wants to fill the soundtrack with abstract noises, rather then conventional music.

O, but wait, there is a lot of conventional music in this film; but it is too much really. Whenever something scary or unusual tends to happen, director Peter Medak apparently didn't want anyone to miss the message that the scene was about to be scary or unusual: so when a child's toy, a little ball, mysteriously falls down the stairs, the full string orchestra burst out with `scary howling manic violins and the likes' so indeed no one could fail to understand that what is going on with that mysterious ball is in fact scary and unusual.

Also the camera is a usueful means to underline the fact that something scary or unusual is going on. When Scott leaves the room in oone scene, a piano key is touched by an invisible finger. To be sure that no one would miss it, Medak lets the camera zoom in with furious intend. Leaving the sole key within the frame and the rest of the piano strategicly outside, Medak ensures himself that indeed we won't miss that scary and unsusual moment.

And so on. And so on. No mood, no real eerie creepy scenes, just a lot of unnecessary bombast and just the trustful face of George C. Scott to hang on to.

One thing is remarkeble however: two elements in this movie: a horrible drowning scene involving a little child and a well from which the child's skeleton later is excavated have returned years later in two critically acclaimed and rather successful Japanese horror movies: ""Dark water"" which has an appartment block haunted by the spirit of a drowned child and ""Ring"" (or ""Ringu"") which has the terrifying well in which the skeletonized body of another child is hidden.

These two movies know how to scare the audience and keep them captivated with an eerie feeling throughout. Both have a strong tension that builds up and never lets go. And both have excellent use of locations, be it this time modern day menacing concrete appartment blocks in stead of big old cosy Victorian houses.

So, in the end, this movie may have been of some use after all.",1151107200,8,4107,4.590723055934515

Subtlety and allusion are much more in evidence than lakes of ketchup and calf brains (etc). It's a film (I feel) that draws you in, little by little. There's the music - quiet oftentimes - but effective. The characters are well developed. And the supernatural phenomena are rarely visual, often aural. That, I feel, is what makes them come across as disturbingly credible. There IS a reason for what is going on in The House. And John Russell, the composer [George C. Scott's character] feels compelled to find out. You, as the viewer, will very likely be more than willing to accompany him. Trish Van Devere (who evidently married George C.

The Changeling isn't a masterpiece, but its a dam fine ghost story and a very good horror film.  With a very good performance from George C. Scott, who draws you in to the film and keeps you watching.

Unlike most horror films where nearly every scene is packed with cheap scares and jumpy parts where a monster or a guy with a knife pops out and terrifies the thick as s*#! teenager, the Changeling has eerie moments and some really creepy scenes that work really well.  The story is very engaging, pulling you in as George C. Scott finds clues and investigates the sounds of banging and child-like laughter in his newly purchased old mansion.  What I really like about this film, is that there are a couple scenes that ACTUALLY gave me the chills.  There are rarely any horror films that actually scare me, and to be honest, i'd like a horror film that would.  The Changeling is not there but its on the right track.

This is the type of horror I love.  Slow, eerie and atmospheric.  The Changeling is a very good horror film that uses music to its advantage, but it does lack in just a few areas.

  Overall, The Changeling is a great film thats only let down by its climatic ending which looks quite silly, but I would still recommend this film to anyone interested.",1148860800,,1404,4.43359375
71293,5,0783116926,"This is a very subtle and spooky film that probably suffered from coming out in the middle of the 1980's horror boom when every other film featured attractive teenagers getting chopped to pieces. The result was that it did not do big business at the time of it's release and is not that well known even now, outside of a few very appreciative fans. The action centres on an elderly (for this genre, anyway) man called John Russell, played by George C Scott, who is recovering from the tragedy of losing his wife and child in an accident, and is taking a break in a remote mansion to catch up with some musical teaching and composing. It doesn't take long for him to realise, however, that the house is haunted. But rather than just flee the place, John is drawn into finding out the cause behind the supernatural activity, which leads him to ultimately even put his own life in jeapardy.

What's great about this film (well, just one of the great things), is that George C Scott can actually act. Always keeping things on the right side of hysteria, his character leads you through the film, and it's easy to idenitfy with his anguish over the terrible accident that robbed him of his family, which can be read as one of the founding emotions that lead him to become fascinated with the haunting. Scott has to carry much of the film alone, which he manages admirably. It's easy to see that this is an intelligent man, coming face to face with many things that he fears, and yet he refuses to run from them. A refreshing change from the bimbos and ""scream queens""  that are usually plonked in this kind of movie situation. In fact the only female character in the movie is the estate agent that found the house, and she is played by Trish Van DeVere, who thankfully is also a great actress, and she breathes life into what is otherwise a pretty small part.

But of course it's the actual haunting that forms the backbone of the film, and I want to credit the filmmakers for the handling of the experience. If I ever find myself in the middle of a supernatural occurence, my expectations are that it would be exactly like this - chilling, frightening and compelling. The seance, when a small, just barely audible voice is captured on tape, is a superb highlight, and the playback of the tape is a masterful sequence of suspense. Better still, the story takes us further than just on a spooky ghost ride, as John gradually uncovers the story behind the ghostly presence, a whole muli-layered back story is revealed, like layers of an onion being peeled away. The explanation for the haunting is poignant and heartbreaking, and the long overdue retribution for the crime that started it all is incredibly satisfying and definitely worth waiting for.

All fans of supernatural movies should really own a copy of this film. It is far better than it sounds on paper, and I'm sure it could have been easily bungled in the wrong hands. But thank goodness the director and screen writer knew what they were doing, and with all the right actors and some superb sets and camera work, what they produce is one of the most effective ghost stories on film since ""The Haunting"".",1148256000,2,3162,4.581272084805653

71295,5,0783116926,"Why ""The Changeling"" is not more well known among fans of the genre is beyond me. I saw it first as a kid and couldn't sleep for a week. I saw it later as a perfectly grown adult, with a mature ability to differentiate between real world and made up horrors, and still find myself awake in the dark and wondering about dusty secrets in the attic above me.
This is a powerful ghost story, one that will cause your muscles to tighten into knots and force your imagination to betray you. George C. Scott looks and feels like a sad man living alone in an old, sprawling house. Strange things began to occur and those things are sensed more than seen. It happens at the edge of your vision and that will unnerve you like no big time monster ever could. The fright of this movie is of the crawling variety, the kind that makes you tense with anticipation. That fright is rivaled only by the story that unfolds, and it unfolds brilliantly and at a masterful pace.
This is one hell of a scary movie and one hell of a story. That's a double punch that makes this a must scene for horror fans and the people who love them. ""The Changeling"" ranks at the top of the list with ""The Exorcist,"" ""Halloween"" and ""The Amityville Horror"" for outright terror.

71297,4,0783116926,"The Changeling (Peter Medak, 1980)

Here's a surprise, for a change: a suspense/horror film that actually delivers the goods.

Composer John Russell (the formidable George C. Scott) witnesses the death of his wife and daughter in a horrific traffic accident, and has a hard time moving on with his life. In an attempt to help, an old friend offers him a job teaching music at his alma mater. While looking for a place to live, he consults the local historical society, meeting Clare Norman (The Hearse's Trish Van Devere) and quickly finding an old mansion he falls in love with. It doesn't take him long to figure out that he's not alone there, and the bulk of the movie deals with Russell's attempts to lay the ghost who coinhabits the house to rest.

Dark, spooky, and atmospheric, The Changeling is something few American horror films have been since the introduction of the slasher film. It takes time to build its characters, and its suspense, so that by the time we actually meet the supernatural forces, we're perfectly willing to suspend disbelief. Medak, who goes from television to feature film directing without a hitch on a regular basis (he's recently directed episodes of smash TV series House, Carnivale, and Law and Order: Special Victims Unit; his last big-screen foray was the unfortunately forgettable Species II), throws in enough jumps to keep the edge-of-your-seat chaps interested, and a big ""things blow up"" kind of ending for the action film fans, but if you took them away, what you'd still have as an intelligent, very well crafted supernatural thriller. Very nicely done. *** ",1141171200,3,1605,4.933333333333334
71298,5,0783116926,"With the horror genre being comprised of a mass of blood and dead teenagers, where have all the great American ghost stories gone? The Changeling is great start. As a movie, it is a stand alone in that it was released at a time when horror had taken a back seat to the resurgence of science fiction (Star Wars, Alien) and right before it became chic to be under 18,  high on hormones and ready to be impaled by a cleaver. It stars George C. Scott in a different yet typically brooding role and Trish Van Devere as his quivering helpmate. The Changeling contains all the elements of a Halloween night-flashlight under the covers-ghost story. The enormous, lumbering shell of a mansion Scott has rented to morn the loss of his wife and daughter, the objects that move by themselves, the echoing noises that awaken him in the middle of the night, and most importantly, the sad and tragic story behind the house itself. There are only a handful of in-your-face scares, but the most effective scares are the unseen ones. In one particular hair raiser, Van Devere goes to the house to seek Scott and upon entering hears him mumbling to himself in another part of the house. She slowly walks upstairs as we continue to hear him. After a few minutes we realize it's the ghost imitating Scott,kind of cosmic tape recording.

Now, more than 20 years later, I was able to let my three kids (ages 15, 13 & 9) watch it, together with some of their cousins and friends, and it still leaves that creepy, hair-raising feeling.

It's a solid 4 stars out of 6 really, but because amazon.com only allows 5 stars top it is a bit hard to reward movies of any kind between middle-good and fantastic; 4 stars describes a good movie like indeed ""The Changeling"" is.

I am a big fan of ""spooky"" supernatural/phsycological-thrillers, and especially when there's a big old mansion involved. A mystery-house full of secrets. This house did not let me down, though I have to begin my review by saying that the start of this thriller looked a bit ""pale"". A door that opens itself, loud sudden unexplainable noises in the house sounding of rage and thunder -effective, it wakes your curiosity, but the first part of the movie is far more strange than scary. And -honestly- at first I thought that this is going to be a ""cute"" little ghost story involving some nice ghost trying to make contact. I was wrong.

I really liked the last part of the movie that made the a bit slow start well worth it (I liked the movie from the start don't get me wrong). It was actually creepy at times. One scene that could have looked stupid turned out rather frightning, the scene involving the wheelchair and the stairs. Yes, ""The Changeling"" made an horrific turn, and had my attention entirely.

The outcome of ""the ending"" was a bit confusing. Is the ghost evil? Will it find rest? If not, what will it take? It was a little unclear on that point, at least I thought it was. In my opinion either the mystery gets solved in a ghost story, and the haunting stops. That or the evil goes on. No big deal, but I was a little confused by the final scene. A couple of other scenes were also unexplained (the policeman in the car-accident).

George C. Scott shines in ""The Changeling"", as he does always -I am a big fan of his work. The picture looked ""old"", and the sound was rather poor too -this should have been improved, the movie deserves that much.

And, believe it or not, this ghost has a good reason for disturbing the peace.

The Changeling surprised me by using just as much (if not more) plot as it did horror. The horrors you'll experience in this film are usually more psychological than visually freaky -- although you will get your share of classic ghost-related images and sounds to help you along.

71313,4,0783116926,"Few films are capable of truly frightening me, but The Changeling is an exception. I first saw this movie in the mid-1980s as a kid, and it scared the living hell out of me. Even as an adult, The Changeling still gives me a good old fashioned case of the creeps. And it will do the same for you.

If you haven't seen the movie, I strongly urge you to go to the Internet Movie Database and download the trailer for The Changeling. The trailer alone is enough to make the hair raise on your neck.

If there ever was a movie that was made to be watched at night in the dark, it is most definitely The Changeling. Anything less than viewing this film in a subdued, eerie atmosphere would be anti-climactic and insulting. For adding spookiness, watch this movie alone.

I will not ruin the storyline, but the plot revolves around a middle-aged music professor moving cross-country to suburban Washington following the tragic death of his wife and daughter. Dr. Russel purchases a large, gothic mansion and attempts to restart his life. However, Dr. Russel quickly finds out that he has some uninvited company...

Part of what makes a good movie into a classic is its influence on future films. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. The Changeling has impacted haunted house movies over the past decade. Remember the frantic seance scene in The Others? How about the reflection-in-the-tub scene from What Lies Beneath? Both these films should be ashamed of themselves for plagiarising content from The Changeling.

My only critique with the movie is John Russel's non-chalant, ""so what?"" attitude regarding the house. Doors slam, bangs and booms are heard throughout the night, objects move on their own, and horrifying visions are seen...yet John Russel acts as if it's no big deal.

On the whole, however, The Changeling is a great, spooky film - a throwback to the era when horror movies attempted to frighten audiences by creating an eerie, unsettling atmosphere and tapping into the viewers' psychological fears. Today the horror genre has been all but destroyed with excess gore and high body counts.

The Changeling is the best haunted house movie since The Uninvited. My only fear is that Hollywood will continue its recent trend of tarnishing the image of classic films by attempting to re-create The Changeling. I don't want what happened to Pyscho and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre to happen to this one.

I came into the room and started to it when George C Scott came into this attic bathroom on the third floor of the house.
Fittenly,but not convieniently for me it was dark out by the time the film ended,
and so I ended following my sister around for the rest of the evening, afraid to walk down the hall or even go into the bathroom. My skin was crawling.....
The ""hide and go spook"" stradegy of this movie to me was simply the eriee piano music and the remote feeling camera point of veiws which would have you going down a hall way or staring up a stairs that fades inevitably into the dark back ground.
The scariest premise of the film I thought was the idea of sleeping alone in this enormous house on the second floor only to have another set of stairs that asends to a darker unit of wierd shaped attic bed and bathrooms along with a closet which like the film may have a boarded off door with yet another stairs that asends to an even darker isolated room.
The film`s camera work makes you feel alone in the house, like in one scene George C Scott is playing a haunting melody on the piano, and immediatly you are peering down a dark quiet stairwell as you hear the piano faintly playing in the distance from the other side of the house.
What you notice about George C Scott`s character is that he shows a sherlock holmes curiousity rather than a morbid hostilaty towards the house`s murky enviroment.
The fact that this film was made in 1979 adds to the musty dated atmosphere through out the film.

The actors are all the more believeable in their very ordinariness--even as well-known a face as George C. Scott's becomes unfamiliar, any man you pass on the street.

Even the house is forced to play its part well below the melodrama level any elaborate, lowering mansion can bring to a film, and the effect of all this restraint evokes panic, denial and absolute believability in the watcher. Although OK, OK, it's admittedly great fun to parody with friends (especially the psychic scene), watching this movie in the right atmosphere can produce a frisson unequalled by profuse bloodshed or preposterous makeup.

My only disappointment in this film is my discovery a few years ago that one of its most dramatic, memorable moments (involving a ball and a bridge) was cribbed from a French film.

71325,5,0783116926,"""The Changeling"" is one of those rare haunted house films that they simply do not make anymore.  It actually has a plot and provokes some emotion from the viewer, not having to utilize retarded special effects, goofball celebrities, and senseless gore.

I would characterize this film as a mood piece, and it works well.  George C. Scott does an astounding, irritable job as always, playing a composer who has lost his wife and child to

a horrendous car accident.  Then, in a convenient turn of events, he moves into a house with an unpleasant history.

Melvyn Douglas seems to have a knack for playing creepy old men with horrific secrets.  He's got that stern, angular face, the kind of look a stingy old grandfather would have while scolding a child for something petty.

As it turns out, the house that Scott moves into was formerly inhabited by a handicapped boy who was drowned for money.  The scene in which Scott tries to evoke the spirit of the boy in a seance is unforgettable.  The only problem with the film is the ridiculously quick pace at which the intricacies of the plot are revealed.  Scott is barely living in the house for two days before he is heading to the department of psychical research and telling his friends that a ghost is trying to communicate with him.

Two objects play a serious part in the film: the ball which Scott's deceased daughter used to play with, and a creaky old wheelchair.  The ball just won't stop rolling down the stairs, and the chair won't stop wheeling around in supernatural rage.

What makes the movie is Scott's performance.  He lends credibility to a somewhat murky and confusing plot.  His rage at the injustice done to the boy, and by extension his determination to reveal the Senator (Douglas) as the ""changeling"" is also an attempt to make sense of the death of his wife and child.

Pulling off a film that actually delivers chills is not an easy task.

And to some extent, that's acceptable. I love to watch gory films. But if you seek movies that can actually make you jump, you've got a much smaller body of work to choose from. I'm not talking about films that rely on cheap scare tactics, like someone charging out of the shadows or the old ""hand on the shoulder"" gag. I'm talking about slow, subtle scares that build to a nail biting intensity over a period of time. ""The Changeling"" fits this bill quite nicely, although the film does have a few problems that occasionally get in the way of the shocks. If you enjoy this movie, you may want to check out ""The Woman in Black,"" ""The House on Haunted Hill,"" and ""Ghost Story"" for further ""spirits gone wild"" thrills and chills.

John Russell (George C. Scott) watched helplessly as his pretty wife and young daughter perished in a horrible automobile accident. Overcome with crushing grief, Russell gives up his career as a composer in New York to head across the country to the state of Washington. His talents as a musician allow him to obtain a post at a local university, but he needs to find some new digs so he can maintain his privacy. A suggestion from friends leads him to the local historical society where Claire Norman (Trish Van Devere) recommends he rent out Chessman House, a local landmark currently unoccupied. Why the historical society is in the real estate business is a question without an answer, but Russell willing agrees to move into the decrepit but beautiful house anyway. To say something is wrong with this old building ranks as one of the great understatements in cinematic history. A ghost haunts Chessman House; a very angry spirit whose sole purpose in life (no pun intended--in fact, a double pun!) is convincing Russell to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding its demise. At first, Russell isn't convinced that anything is wrong with the house. Sure, he hears some weird booming noises in the middle of the night, and his piano occasionally bangs out an odd note or two when no one is around, but these oddities do convince the musician to launch an investigation into the house's history.

Things really start to get weird once we learn about the background of Chessman House. According to local rumors and historical documents, a family living in the house back in the early twentieth century lost a daughter in a coal truck accident. Subsequent horrors convince our protagonist that the spirit inhabiting the building has nothing to do with this incident. For example, Russell witnesses the apparition of a young boy in a bathtub upstairs, and the voices he starts hearing don't sound like that of a young girl. In the film's best scene, a plastic ball bounces down the house's stairs and comes to rest right in front of Russell. The composer takes the toy and throws it in a nearby creek only to come home to discover the ball bouncing down the stairs again! Chilly! The truth becomes clearer in another ultra eerie scene when a psychic visits the house and channels a message from Joseph, a boy who lived in the house before the family with the girl ever arrived. It is the revenant of this young child communicating with John Russell, and the composer henceforth methodically unearths the mystery behind the ghost in Chessman House. No spoilers here, but ultimately a powerful senator, an abandoned well, and a small room in the attic provide the necessary clues in solving the mystery.

I liked ""The Changeling"" immensely. Some of the creepiest stuff ever caught on camera unfolds in this movie. Even better is how the filmmakers tie in the haunting with an engaging, multileveled mystery story replete with red herrings, murder, greed, and stolen identities. I had a discussion with a person I know who also saw ""The Changeling,"" and they complained about George C. Scott being miscast in the role of John Russell. I didn't see that at all; I thought Scott a perfect fit for the part, and the actor played the character as a rational individual determined to solve the mystery of his surroundings quite convincingly and with effective nuance. If anything, it was nice to see Scott take a subtler role. Perhaps the movie's greatest difficulty lay in the failure of the filmmakers to do a better job tying in Russell's family tragedy with the otherworldly experiences of Chessman House. Here's a guy going through a catastrophe involving the demise of his wife and daughter, and yet he's trying to deal with the issues surrounding another fatality. That's probably why he does follow through with his investigation, namely as a way of working through his own personal tragedy, but the movie doesn't convey that as well as it should.

Forget about any extras on the disc. If memory serves me correctly, the only thing included on the DVD other than the film was a trailer. That's disappointing considering the level of creepiness ""The Changeling"" achieves. At the very least a commentary track would have been nice, but such is not to be. Still, the movie works very well on its own without any external elaboration from the people behind the scenes. If you want something more cerebral, and scarier than the average horror flick, you'll want to see ""The Changeling.""",1093910400,17,5593,4.8289885297184565

Running Time:  109 minutes.
Rated R for violence and some language.
At a time when the horror genre was shifting away from the suspenseful notions of such classics as ""Psycho"", ""Rosemary's Baby"", and ""Halloween"", this film is a pleasant surprise of a horror-thriller due to its firm, gripping script, excellent musical and orchestrating score, and fine performances from the entire cast.  Medak presents George C. Scott's character as a rigid puzzle piece searching for the rest of the connection as a lonely, old composer who thrives on seclusion.  Attempting to get on with his life after his wife and child are tragically killed, the music lover buys a new home and looks forward to the new chapter of his life; however, an evil presence lurks in the halls.
As the horror of ""The Changeling"" proceeds, Scott's character is transformed into a soul searching for the reasons for his failures and short-comings, all the while trying to survive in a haunted estate.  A truly ghoulishly fun film that gladly mimmicks the work of previous classic films of the genre, in turn producing a very enjoyable thriller that deserves much more respect than it has received.

71339,5,0783116926,"The Changeling is not a Horror Film, it is a good old fashioned Ghost Story that is done so very well. The film, for its somewhat low-budget and minimal use of Hollywood stars, except for Scott, has managed to transcend all of its restrictions into an almost Oscar winning vehicle and yet still remains independent in look and feel to give it that cult vintage appeal.
The music, set design, script and acting are all on top form however the cinematography is what makes this film stand out. Nowhere since Rosemary's Baby has a house looked so creepy and yet still remained homely at the same time. What is upstairs in this house is the kind of the place that you would never want to visit with a group, yet Scott goes up there by himself alone. Most other films of this type do silly things like putting people in haunted places when obviously they would run away in two second flat but Scott is a BIG MAN and looks tough. He could probably walk down any alley in the world unscathed. So Scott is free to roam his house and live there on his own. The audience does not disbelieve it for one second and this is why the film manages to transcend many for its type. It is that kind of eye of direction and storytelling that makes Peter Medak's little haunted house tale really shine.
This film has it down-pat in atmosphere and haunting ambiance. It does scare. Just make sure that you turn off the lights and watch this one late for full impact. Watching this one during the day almost had me walking around the house looking behind doors and jumping a mile into the air when frozen icicles broke off the roof and landed on my windowsill.
The premise is good - John Russell (Scott) a music professor and composer, loses his wife and family in a terrible accident. Seeking consolation, he moves into an old mansion vacant for twelve years, but a child ghost occurrence seems to be sharing the house with him. The ghost is trying to tell him something. Russell investigates the house's history and discovers a horrific secret.
This movie is in the same vein as What Lies Beneath (2000), Others, The (2001) and Ring, The (2002) but is done so much better. If you like to watch intelligent ""horror"" or a really good Ghost Story yarn then hands down this is what you need. Even though it was made in 1980 it is still bloody scary and tops many a scare movie list.
Go on - I Dare You to Watch It.",1074729600,5,2389,4.395033860045147
71340,4,0783116926,"Director Peter Medak's THE CHANGELING is a highly entertaining and very creepy old-fashioned ghost story.  It stars award-winning actor George C. Scott as John Russell, a musical composer who still grieves over the tragic deaths of his wife and young daughter (the film opens with the accident in which they are killed).  In an attempt to put the loss behind him and move on with his life, Russell accepts a teaching position and moves to another town, where he also rents a rather dilapidated old mansion.  It doesn't take long for him to realize that his new domicile is haunted, and when he learns that the ghost is that of a young boy who was stealthily murdered in the early 1900s, he throws himself wholeheartedly into the task of solving the mysterious crime.  He is assisted in the endeavor by the real-estate agent who arranged his rental contract, played by Scott's wife Trish Van Devere.

This film follows the old-school, Hitchcockian method of sucking the unwitting audience into the fantasy and thereby creating a genuine visceral horror.  Unlike a lot of more contemporary genre fare, THE CHANGELING subtly builds tension by first concentrating on character development.  Then, once the audience has some empathy for the protagonists, the details of the haunting and the related crime slowly unfold as the film's atmosphere becomes more & more eerie and more & more unsettling.  So when the film's scariest events finally take place, the audience has been psychologically primed for being genuinely spooked.

The acting in this film is superb.  In contrast to the arrogant, flamboyantly self-assured characters that Scott is generally famous for playing, his John Russell is a sensitive and vulnerable man who seems truly concerned with the plight of others, and Scott delivers an exceptional performance that is just this side of stupendous.  It's a shame that he wasn't offered more roles such as this.  The always beautiful Trish Van Devere does a great turn as the real-estate agent who assists Russell, and she does an especially good job and exuding terror when she is confronted vis-&agrave;-vis by things that go bump in the night.  Also turning in a wonderful performance is the highly revered Melvyn Douglas, here portraying a rather smarmy politician in one of his last roles.  Genre fans will recognize Mr. Douglas from an early performance as Roger Penderel in another spook-house film, James Whale's classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-OLD-DARK-HOUSE/dp/B00000ILEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE OLD DARK HOUSE</a>.

Like some of its notable predecessors, this old-fashioned ghost story creates lots of gooseflesh and increases the heart rate without resorting to lots of gratuitous gore or stomach-churning make-up effects.  So keep in mind, then, that fans who prefer only blood-and-guts horror may find THE CHANGELING a bit slow going.  However, anyone who enjoys great acting, great story-telling, and deep-in-the-pit-of-your-stomach psychological scares will really enjoy watching this oft-overlooked gem.",1073865600,236,3090,5.485232067510548
71341,5,0783116926,"***WARNING: A few plot spoilers follow!***
First of all, I must say I am reviewing this film as a jaded horror fan which has seen the best and worst of horror that Hollywood has had to offer.  It seems that over the past 20 years that the trend has gone from genuinely frightening to ho-hum to laughable.  Therefore, I love it when certain ""new classics"" arise to prove that trend is not always correct.
""The Changeling"" gets the formula right on so many levels.  A haunted house done in the style of ""The Haunting"" (the Julie Harris version, not the trash that was done on the remake), but with original elements.  George C. Scott (who later went on to star in a great version of ""A Christmas Carol"") plays ""John Russell"", a musician who tragically loses his wife and daughter in the blink of an eye one fateful day.  He choses to move to a vast, empty mansion in Seattle where he resides alone.  Or so he thinks.  He soon learns that he has an uninvited guest when unexplained clanging and drafts occur on a regular basis.
One might argue that if this film was made today, the director may have resorted to CGI for this film, thus ruining some of the ghostly apparitions.  Maybe so, but thankfully, no cheap tricks or special effects gore clog this movie's veins.  What we encounter is a dark, melancholy house which slowly and almost imperceptibly builds an atmosphere of tension and suspense.  This atmosphere leads to a stratospheric climax in the famous ""seance scene"", which as one previous reviewer noted, was borrowed in totality by Stephen King for his miniseries ""Rose Red"".
For that matter, while watching this film, I noticed quite a few similarities from ""The Others"" as well.  I mean, come on, a groundskeeper named ""Mr. Tuttle""?  Also, the idea of the ""seen"" vs the ""unseen"" history of the house (for example, the piecing together of the history of its inhabitants prior to the 1920s).  ""The Others"" accomplishes this similarly with the hidden photo albums in the attic, in addition to the deliberately vague information provided by the three strangers who appear to take care of the house.  And ""Rose Red"" has the main ""villianess/heroine/protagonist"" (depending on your point of view) actually ""living"" in a hidden part of the house (whose ever changing geography was a brilliant conception of King and King alone, so far as I know).
Anyhow, the thematic similarities between these three films (""The Changeling"" of course long preceeded the other two) does nothing the sully the reputation of the two newer films.  On the contrary, I think the writers and production teams were paying homage to this film, and each of those films has many distinctive elements which make them extraordinary on their own.
Trish Van Devere puts in a strong performance as Scott's co-star, ""Claire Norman"".  It did not surprise me later to learn that she and Scott (were, Scott died in 1999) husband and wife, as their scenes together seemed very warm, natural, and convincing.  Of course, in the end, she gets the wits scared out of her and gives quite a few hearty screams.
Melvyn Douglas, an accomplished actor himself, stars as ""Senator Joseph Carmichael"".  We learn that he has an intimate connection to the occurrences at Chessman House, though I must say I was completely surprised by exactly how he fits in the puzzle.  And that is something else worth commenting on.  This is in fact a detective story of sorts, a mystery entertwined with a haunted house.  I found this very interesting, and refreshing, much in the style of ""The Others"", the magnificent film I alluded to earlier.  There is no ""dramatic irony"" here because we literally find out what is going on as the character does.
I think that some parts are a bit predictable, but it is safe to say that every viewer will be at least slightly taken off guard by the twists and turns this film takes.  And this is a good thing.  The only weaknesses in this film were the insertion of the ""conspiracy angle"" with Mrs. Huxley and the rather hokey ending with the figure of Senator Carmichael ascending the flaming staircase.  I found myself thinking of the Apostle's Creed, saying, ""(Jesus) died, and ascended into hell"" (read that carefully).  It is made clear that this is a hallucination of Scott's as another shot shows Douglas sitting at his desk at home, clutching his chest in the throes of a (fatal) heart attack.  Still, I think a much stronger ending would have had Douglas drawing a bath, then found later in his tub, dead, of a heart attack.  No special effects.  No earthquakes.  Just a frozen expression of sheer terror on his face.  And wearing his medal.  After seeing the film, you'll see what I mean by this.
Anyway, I shouldn't second guess the writing/direction team on an otherwise flawless effort.  Ideally, I would rate this at four and a half stars, but five does not misrepresent the quality of the film.  Yes, it is definitely a period piece, but what horror movie isn't?  I think that if you have reasonable expectations that don't involve buckets of blood, gore, and a sensory overload of CGI, you'll really enjoy this film.",1072569600,4,5113,4.745475113122172

71344,5,0783116926,"I doubt I will be the last person in history to praise the enjoyable creepiness of ""The Changeling,"" the near-peerless haunted house thriller that slithered out of Canada in 1980. To this day, I still have a difficult time watching this film alone. I can recall viewing this flick with a girlfriend on a dark and stormy Halloween night. About halfway in, she literally left the room crying, asking me to turn on the light.
I think the mood is extremely important to ""The Changeling."" The opening tragedy that befalls the protagonist's family is about as terrifying a prologue as ever seen in film. The Canadian locale (I believe this was filmed in the Vancouver area) is dark and overcast, with an old house that looks about as far from a Hollywood backlot as any house could possibly be. The extraordinary cast, including Academy Award winners George C. Scott and Melvyn Douglas, also lend a respectable air to the eerie proceedings. Frankly, this is good old-fashioned horror that proves the great axiom - `Less is more.' You will find no gateway's to hell or murdering witches or serial killers in ""The Changeling."" Just a ghost - the ghost of a murdered child.
Scott plays a grief-stricken musician who moves into an old dark house, working as a professor at the nearby university. He eventually begins hearing weird sounds in his dusty abode and, after a bit of investigation, discovers a hidden room in the attic - a hidden room with a wheelchair. Scott begins to research the house's history, eventually discovering a dark secret stretching all the way to the local Senator (Douglas, of course). And did I say there was the ghost of a murdered child? Not wanting to give away the scares, let's just say vignettes involving the wheelchair and a rubber ball are some of the spookiest scenes ever filmed. And, of course, there's the seance.
British director Peter Medak (having done ""The Ruling Class"" previously) has done a superb job in building the tension of this film. Camera angles peering around corners, leering from above and rapidly moving up the stairs towards dark, hidden rooms, cause the proceedings to be almost unbearable. And of course, you have George C. Scott, an actor who never really gave a bad performance in a film. ""The Changeling"" is no exception. One of the greatest American actors of all time, Scott is matching wits with an extremely indignant ghost. As a lover of the supernatural genre, I am lucky this great talent chose such an unusual project to participate in. Quite simply, ""The Changeling,"" like ""The Haunting"" made 20 years before, is one of the greatest horror films of all time.",1071619200,,2623,4.818181818181818

While John makes a call, his wife and daughter decide to have a snowball fight. Suddenly, a mack truck rips through the icey landscape and directly into the two, killing them instantly.
A little while later, John decides he must move out of his house due to many memories that make him depressed beyond belief. With the help of Claire Norman, a worker at the local historical society, he finds an old mansion to rent out and continue to compose.
Then things get frightening. Each day, very early, there is a sound of pipes clanking throught the house. He tries to compose but finds it hard still. Then, he starts to play a song. A lullaby. He plays it seemingly perfectly. When he exits the room, a key is struck on the piano-but no one is in there. Things get out of hand when John sees a vision of a little boy drowning in a bathtub.
While about to take a walk outside, John is startled by a rock thrown out of a window of the attic. A room that he had no idea about. He goes up there to find a bunch of stuff. Including a music box. The music box plays the same lullaby that he played days earlier.
He and Claire decide that maybe a medium could come to the house and see what's what. Then they find out what exactly is in the house and how to stop it....

71347,4,0783116926,"The editorial review by Andrew Wright pretty much says it all. THE CHANGELING is probably the best haunted house movie since the original version of THE HAUNTING. It's chilling and intense, but without much overt violence, bloodiness, or special effects overkill. My only disagreement with Wright is when he calls THE CHANGELING a ""horror"" film. A horror film, by contemporary standards, it is NOT (if that's what you're looking for, look elsewhere). Sublety is the order of the day, and it works very well. George C. Scott gives a nice performance in the lead role.
My problem with this movie is how to rate it. It doesn't quite have the classic production features of THE UNINVITED and it isn't going to be found on any ""top 100 movie"" lists, so it's hard for me to give it five stars. On the other hand, I really like THE CHANGELING. Like THE HAUNTING, it's creepy without bludgeoning you with hordes of computer-animated ghosts running up and down the stairs. It gives you something wierd and lets your imagination do the rest. I've decided to be a bit conservative here. I'm only giving THE CHANGELING four stars. It's a strong four stars, thought. This is a great flick for Halloween, or for any dark and stormy night. If you're looking for a good haunted house movie, they don't get much better than this.

I still recall the sleepless nights hiding under my blanket and plugging my ears so I wouldn't hear the sound of a ball bouncing down the stairs, or a little childs voice moaning for justice.  I vowed never to watch this movie again.
A few years later (ok, many years later!!!) I figured I was old enough and brave enough to see it again, and you know what?, It still scared the cr#p out of me!!!!  I guess a good horror movie is a good horror movie regardless of age or time.
The Changeling is the creepiest film ever made.  No blood, no gore, just a good old-fashioned ghost story that captures your interest, then makes you wish that you weren't alone when you started watching it.

71349,5,0783116926,"This film has one of the two scariest scenes that I have ever seen. It's so low-key that you will wonder why I thought it scary at all: but the buildup of George C. Scott's character from total unawareness, to unbelief, to total belief is so powerful and non-sensational that the ""wet ball rolling down the dark stairs"" scene is a heart-stopper: seeing that ball at his feet just about stops poor old George's heart, you can tell; and if you were relating with him, it would just about blast your sanity if it happened to you that way. The whole thing is excellent: a sleeping-murder and ghost story rolled into one. Superb acting all around. Well-crafted plot. Not over-done at all; if anything, under-stated, and that is part of what makes The Changeling work so well.

I've seen it several times but a couple of scenes send chills down my spine nonetheless.  A ghost story/murder mystery combined, The Changeling is an old-fashioned supernatural tale, eschewing blood & guts for atmosphere & suspense.
This is NOT a horror movie.  It is a ghost story.  An extremely well done ghost story, that got little fanfare when it was released, but is far superior to much of the hyped fare then and since.  With a solid cast, led by George C. Scott, the film manages its thrills and chills by technique, i.e., by the adroit use of sound and image, and a carefully crafted buildup of tension.  A good story that overcomes any gaps in its internal logic by good acting and skillful direction and production, The Changeling is well worth a look; however, slash and gore lovers need to look elsewhere.",1062460800,6,912,4.69811320754717

Well, i bought this as a big horror genre fan, based on all the reviews praising this film, i was hoping to be scared into a coma, and i scare pretty easily. i'll admit this movie had a few moments that were geniunely disturbing, and i'm not saying this is a bad movie, it is allright, but it is slow at moments. i don't care for gore, as long as it can disturb and scare you, which this did, just not NEARLY as much as some people claim. it was a good plot, and it did have some GOOD ideas thrown in.
if you're thinking of buying/watching this movie for the FIRST time then you might wanna take what i said into consideration, but by all means watch it (i did give it 3 stars remember), you might find something in it, that i didn't, it wasn't horribly plotted or anything, just unbearably slowpaced, to the point where i just wasn't tense anymore.

71354,5,0783116926,"Every generation seems to have their ""scariest"" film. My parents both recall ""The Uninvited"" (1944) as their favorite terror flick, and there are those who would call ""The Blair Witch Project"" the quintessential horror film of their generation. I choose ""The Changeling"" as the best ghost/suspense/horror film I've ever seen. It was not a huge blockbuster when it was released, but like many films of that ilk, it developed a cult following and is now hailed as one of the best ghost stories of all time. To this day, elements of this film can be glimpsed in other movies (""The Others,"" ""The Ring"").
Because this film was shot with such a small cast of characters and limited exterior scenes (both of which would reveal a definite sense of the style of the times) it does not seem so dated for having been made in the late 1970s (released in 1980). The score is based in the classical style, usually played on the piano, which is a direct reflection of the main character (George C. Scott) who is a classical musician and professor.
To say this film is creepy is an understatement. I admit I am certainly a fan of the slasher/horror films of the 1980s, but the horror in this film comes from the story itself, not from special effects. The scipt, actors, director, score and cinematography work as a perfect team to bring a story of deceipt, murder, suspense and, of course, terror to the screen. Not one element of the film is spelled out for the audience, nor is it hammered into the viewer's head, as in many films of late (""House on Haunted Hill""), nor, thankfully, are we subject to the too-familiar gratuitous love scene between the stars (""Haunted""). The romantic relationship between the lead characters is implied, and we understand the depth of feeling they share with each other. Director Peter Medak tells this story in a slow but certainly not boring pace.
Scott and Van Devere maintain a very strong handle on what could possibly become over-the-top dialogue in the mouths of other actors, and they have both created roles here so tangible and accessible that you, as a viewer, immediately accept their situation, which makes you feel that this could happen to you, which, obviously, makes this a frightening movie.
Unlike other ghost/supernatural films of its time (""The Fog,"" ""The Amityville Horror,"") ""The Changeling"" wraps you up in what ends up being a murder mystery that is revealed slowly by the victim! I think this film was most likely overshadowed by the release of Kubrick's ""The Shining"" (released that same year) which is just as good a telling of a ghost story (if not a more pshychological ghost story), however, in ""The Shining,"" Jack Nicholson's over-the-top performance, as good and juicy as it is, tends to detract from the wonderful tale of paranoia, delusion, hallucination and paranormal activity that Kubrick was trying to tell (in his own translation of the Stephen King story).
In ""The Changeling"" there are certainly shocks and starts along the way, and why would you not expect any from a ghost story? This film certainly proves itself as one of the lesser-known, but best true terror films of our time.",1054684800,7,3145,4.825925925925926

I thought I'd seen every good horror movie on the market until a co-worker had me borrow this DVD. 1980's ""The Changeling"" is a quintessential low-budget vintage horror movie, done in that classic late-1970's style.  George C. Scott is a widower who is walking wounded following the freakish death of his wife and child (without giving away details, the opening scene is a hair-raiser and sets the tone for the rest of the movie).  He moves into a giant, towering mansion to work on his music and recover from his tragic loss.  But a few moments later, weird things happen inside the house.  Piano keys play by themselves.  Voices start speaking.  And loud, banging noises happen out of nowhere.  Come to find out, the house is haunted by a child.  The movie then pursues a murder mystery in which we discover the boy's identity and the history of the house.  Unlike most thrillers, ""The Changeling"" doesn't have much gore, but it has enough intense and spooky moments to make this film earn an R rating.  Instead of aiming for shock, this movie effectively works on the viewer's emotions and has a reasonably interesting plot.  I wouldn't call it the scariest film ever made, but if you're into horror movies of the haunted house variety, then ""The Changeling"" should rank high on your list of DVDs to get.",1054425600,21,1419,4.818181818181818

Where the director miss the point is when a scene become to bring some creepy tension  ... it suddenly cut and jump in time to a boring ordinary scene instead of extending it. All these abrupt cuts ruins entirely all the atmosphere and put the movie to the rank of 'only for the story suspense' instead of real horror film.

Unfortunately, the movie didn't turn out as good as I had hoped.  The director does do a good job of making the audience like his characters.  You feel sorry for Scott's character when few people believe him and you like the ghost because he was just a victim.  But that is almost part of the problem.  Because you find yourself liking the ghost, it is hard to find any of the movie very scary.  Of course, the plot would have suffered terribly if the ghost had been malevolent, but since the ghost is only trying to help Scott realize what had happened to him, it just detracts from the creepiness-factor.  Additionally, I thought much of the movie was predictable.  For example, the moment I saw Scott's character at the bridge, I new the ball would return, and this is supposed to be the creepiest part.  To finish the movie, the ending does not make too much sense (why would the ghost try to hurt Scott, who has been trying to help the ghost all along?).  The Changeling is a decent movie in terms of plot and development, but if you are looking for genuine scares like I was, I suggest you look for something different.",1042070400,2,1263,4.400862068965517

71371,5,0783116926,"The trip down memory lane continues with my recent purchase of The Changeling DVD. It was one of the first horror movies I say. While considered a horror movie, this is movie is more downright creepy than horrific.
This George C. Scott, Trish VanDevere, Melvyn Douglas vehicle is well produced and well acted, depending on story rather than effects, which there are virtually none. It is a combination haunted house/ghost story/murder mystery that evokes a feeling of terror without any gore.
In summary, Scott plays a composer who loses his wife and daughter in a traffic accident in the first scene. He moves into a huge historic mansion where a murder was committed around the turn of the century. VanDevere works for the historic society that rents him this expansive manse that bangs and rumbles mysteriously making sure Scott gets up in time to teach his classes. After discovering a secret room behind a closet (shades of Rosemary's Baby?) he investigates the nasty things that happened in this personable house's past. It's takes a seance to find all the missing pieces as the ghost tells the story of his murder by his father. Seems daddy like money more than his son and would loose it if the sickly stripling kicked it before he turned 21. Daddy disposes of the inferior model and acquires a healthier one through the local orphangae. (Thus the changeling.)
The spirit is well portrayed almost exclusively through the plot. It's only physical manifestations are as a dead body floating in a bathtub. At times it's lonely, other times it's pissed off, and when it seems that things are gonna fall apart, it's downright malevolent, knocking off a police captain that threatens to put the kibosh on Scott's machinations to expose this whole torrid affair. Just like a six year old boy.
The film suffers less as a fashion victim than Scott's film of the previous year, Hardcore. Hey, it was the seventies. We all had those wide lapels. Unfortunately, the ending is muddled and the now senator changeling appears to try and make peace with terror tantrum ghost boy who is tearing down the house by this point. Senator changeling then drops dead of a heart attack. Or did he kick it first. It's not too clear. Aside from this, it's a great movie.
The DVD has a crisp picture with the slightly washed out color you'd expect of a seventies movie and the sound is clear. The only special features are some cast and crew bios.

George C. Scott is amazing in this film...and the tragedy that befalls him in the film's opening sequence is sure to suck you right in.  Following this, Scott is forced to make a single life for himself and he moves into an extremely large and historic house to compose and teach music.  The house is a character in itself...perhaps one of the creepiest I have ever seen (the night scene of Scott walking across the front yard still chills me...very, very spooky).  As another reviewer mentioned, the house is so vast that it is unimaginable to think of ONE person occupying it.  Well, in this case, it's actually one person...and one supernatural murdered boy who has one heck of a story to tell.  I don't want to tell that story...but it will be revealed to you sure enough if you can make it through the unrelenting and horrific duration of this film.
But not to give away too much...Certain scenes in the film chilled me to the very bone (the seance scene, the quest for the leaky faucet sound, and many more.)  Just when I thought I had survived it...the scenes kept coming...scaring the breath out of me.  In a nutshell...if you are bothered by ghosts, darkness, ghostly voices, or anything paranormal...you WILL without a doubt be scared stiff by this one.  I had trouble sleeping for at least 3 or 4 nights...and I was about 22 at the time.
The film makes excellent use of camera angles and movement, darkness, and sound effects...in essence scaring you with what you can't see but know is there.  The music is also extremely unsettling at times.  But enough said...the only true way to understand the horror of this film is to experience it.  BUT BEWARE...YOU WERE WARNED.

71378,5,0783116926,"Long before scary movies involved blood and gore, George C Scott starred in this horror film that is very spooky, indeed! Scott plays a composer who, having just lost his wife and daughter, moves into a very atmospheric old house in New England to get some serious writing done. Shortly after moving in, Scott is contacted by the spirit of a young boy who died in the house. But what is it the boy is trying to tell him?
There are scenes in this film that never cease to make my hair stand on end, no matter how many times I have seen the film (and that's alot of times...). The scene with the ball which belonged to Scott's daughter which won't go away, the chair at the top of the stairs, the ghostly voice superimposed on the tape recording of the seance, the chase through the attic... my skin crawls even now.
One can empathise with the rage of the spirit of a child, crippled and confined to a wheelchair in life, and his desperation and frustration when he tries repeatedly to convey a message which Scott, though all ears, continues to fail in understanding. Oh, and the film is supposedly based on true events.... hopefully dramatised for effect.
While the ending is not anywhere near as gripping in conclusion as the road to it, the film is certainly one you do not want to watch alone at night in a very big, spooky house.",1027382400,9,1333,4.4227642276422765

71389,4,0783116926,"Made in a period when most horror films were of the slasher and blood-and-guts variety, THE CHANGELING dramatizes that the best scares come from unsettling understatement rather than from easy gory shocks. George C. Scott stars as a wealthy composer whose wife and daughter have died in a sudden horrifying incident; he moves from New York to a large abandoned historic mansion in Seattle to work and recuperate from his losses. As time passes, he becomes aware of a presence within the house that seems to settle in a hidden attic room.
While not quite in the highest echelon of haunted house films (such as THE HAUNTING and THE INNOCENTS) due to a needless Watergate-inspired conspiracy subplot and the silly De Palmaesque sequence relating the deaths Scott's wife and daughter near the beginning of the film, THE CHANGELING is certainly close to that high level. There are several classically creepy sequences, including the playback sequence, the dripping water sequence, and the scene of the young girl and the vision under her bedroom, that showcase what magnificent film editing (and sound editing) can do. The very best of these is the famous seance, probably the best ever filmed: the quickening tempo of the editing, the medium's creepy lack of affect as she intones her questions to the dead child, and the eerie sounds of her automatic writing scratching against the page (punctuated by her husband's one-word readings of the messages the child leaves) leaves a very haunting effect after the film is over. An interesting sidenote: clearly Stephen King borrowed heavily for this film for his 2002 miniseries ROSE RED, which lifts many details (the aforementioned automatic writing sequence, the Seattle setting for the haunted house, and the visual imagery of the tower room and the staircase leading up to it) wholesale from THE CHANGELING.",1017360000,2,1853,5.098684210526316

71397,4,0783116926,"THE CHANGELING

(Canada - 1979)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Stereo

With its highbrow aspirations and classy production values, Peter Medak's elegant ghost story ranks alongside the likes of THE DEVIL AND DANIEL WEBSTER (1941) and PORTRAIT OF JENNIE (1948) as one of the most accomplished ghost stories ever filmed. It opened theatrically in 1980 amid a glut of low budget shockers which dominated US theaters at the time, and was quickly lost in the shuffle. But good movies never die, they simply bide their time, and THE CHANGELING is now widely recognized as a bona fide classic by fans and novices alike.

The late and much-lamented George C. Scott plays a classical composer who is recovering from the death of his wife and daughter in a terrible accident. Having taken a teaching job in Seattle, he rents a brooding old mansion where he hopes to rediscover the meaning in his life, but his plans are interrupted by a restless spirit which makes its presence felt and reveals the details of a horrific crime which took place at the turn of the 20th century in an attic room at the top of the house, a crime which implicates a powerful local politician (Melvyn Douglas) whose career was constructed on the foundations of murder...

Like the mansion itself, THE CHANGELING is a grand and stately affair which forsakes outlandish displays of supernatural horror in favor of quiet, creepy details (a door creaking open of its own accord in broad daylight; a cluttered attic room festooned with cobwebs where a child's wheelchair stands in perpetual attendance, etc.), until Scott is fored to summon a medium after being repeatedly woken every morning by an unearthly pounding which echoes throughout the entire house (the explanation for which is both credible and deeply unsettling). While the seance itself is a memorably eerie sequence, it's actually surpassed by the scene directly afterward in which Scott listens to an audio recording of the entire episode. Here, the Dolby Stereo soundtrack transforms a simple, chilling idea into one of the most hair-raising set-pieces you'll ever see. Sound actually plays a vital role in the film's seductive charm, and sensitive viewers are advised that the film is genuinely frightening in places, especially viewed late at night in a darkened room with the Dolby processor cranked up to the max! You have been warned...

John Coquillon's restless camerawork transforms the ornate mansion into a character all its own, and the autumnal Seattle landscape provides scant relief from the sense of impending horror generated by Medak's accumulation of details. Performances are top-drawer, including Trish Van Devere (Scott's real-life wife) as the real estate agent who becomes mixed-up in the murder inquiry, John Colicos as a cop who thinks Scott's investigation of the crime amounts to little more than an assault on Douglas' integrity, and Ruth Springford as an elderly patron of the local historical society whose sullen attitude towards Scott's mansion conceals a darker truth and provides the first clue to its tragic history. Jean Marsh cameos as Scott's ill-fated wife.

Incredibly, scriptwriters William Gray and Diana Maddox were unable to match this film's artistic success in their subsequent screen work, and while Maddox' only other movie credit appears to be THE AMATEUR (1982), Gray co-wrote scripts for routine offerings like THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT (1984) and BLACK MOON RISING (1985) before becoming a producer on the unsuccessful primetime revival of ""Dark Shadows"" (1990), amongst several other TV and movie titles. Hungarian-born director Medak, who began his career with a number of critically acclaimed black comedies like NEGATIVES (1968) and THE RULING CLASS (1972), later distinguished himself with the intense true-crime dramas THE KRAYS (1990) and LET HIM HAVE IT (1991), before losing his way on the Hollywood treadmill.",1004572800,8,3923,5.237261146496815

There's a refreshing absence of pointless fluff and the supporting cast are more than competant. An excellent choice for fans of classic horror films.

Scott is great and the direction can very well hold with Kubrick's ""The Shinning"".  This is a well thought out movie and brings back the memories of being scared as a kid.

I told them, ""We must rent this.""  They said, ""It looks too old.""  I said, ""We must rent this...and you will all love it.""  I think I was 19.
We rented it.  They all loved it.
Now, I'm 28 and wandering around [...] and looky here, it's coming out on DVD.

He rents a gorgeous, sprawling home, and that's when the mystery begins. He's awoken one morning by the sound of pounding, echoing throughout the house.

It is one of the spookiest movies I have ever seen. It is not gory in any way, but the scare factor is much higher than any of the nightmare on elms or friday the 13ths or any of that stuff.
The Changeling has a great story line, great acting and an all around eerie feel. Including the camera work and soundtrack to boot. The only reason I didn't give this dvd 5 stars is due to the lack of extras and the audio leaves something to be desired.

A wonderful film which won--deservedly so--a whopping 8 Genie awards back in '80.  And this is not a film with scares that get tamed over time like most movies.  There is no gore here, no monsters, but a truely frightening psychological ghost story.  And a good mystery to boot!
The music in this film is wonderful!...It is the best mixture of images and sound I've ever seen for a scary movie.  A large percentage of fear in this film is due to the eerie music.

The movie was dead on with the idea that you don't have to do anything visually appealing  to score a hit with your audience. Although it had its visual moments (such as it's haunting finale), a lot of it was due to eerie noises and subtle reactions (with no annoying overacting) from star George C. Scott. One way I identify a good horror movie is if the movie (or part of the movie) sticks with me for a while. This movie did that with the brief shot of the wheelchair sitting at the top of the stairs, looking down at the 2 of them. It's very creepy, and it stays with you, along with a few other moments in the film. The dvd transfer is great (as i had rented a vhs version as well and compared the two), it has wonderfully dark scenery and great sound. Unfortunately the disc has only bios, but to have the movie in such great quality, it's no big deal. More people should see this movie, it's not getting the right amount of attention.

71435,5,0783116926,"Well it was a long time coming, but Peter Medak's 'The Changeling' comes to DVD at last. This film is one of the few that manages to frighten and  unnerve, without the obligatory gorefest seen in modern horror flicks.
George C. Scott turns in a top-notch performance as John Russell, a  composer who moves from New York to an old house in Washington state, after  his family are wiped out in a road accident. Over time, he realises that  something from the past is trying to communicate with him, reaching out  from beyond the grave.
I won't give any more plot details away, but the  story is a clever interweave of mystery and the supernatural, complete with  seances, nocturnal grave diggings and ghostly revenge!
The DVD transfer  is pretty good, a little grainy in places, although - for the first time -  a Dolby Surround soundtrack more than compensates. Extras are sparse -  chapter selection and cast/crew bios - but this is a minor gripe.

Since there are a number of reviews here that go into  great detail summarizing the plot, which is much better left to the viewer  - it is a mystery, after all - I want to comment on the DVD version, for  all those who are familiar with the film and have been anxiously awaiting  the DVD. There seems to be very little information about how the film is  presented on most websites that I've found, but after obtaining my own  copy, I have to say that even though there's a lack of extras, the DVD does  not disappoint. The picture quality is surprisingly wonderful. Colours are  rich and deep, with great dark scenes and warm hues. The picture does not  appear plugged up or oversaturated, and is refreshingly natural. Like the  recent DVD release of ""Jaws"", it's like watching this film for  the first time. Astonishingly, there are no distracting artifacts and the  picture does not look dated at all, and as one who has owned about 4 VHS  copies in the past, I can honestly say that this is the best this film has  ever looked. Contrary to what some websites say, the DVD is presented in a  16x9 widescreen format, and appears to have been matted at about 1.78:1.  The Dolby Surround is great, heightening the suspense and atmosphere  wonderfully.  If you are a fan of this film, the DVD is a dream come true,  and if you're simply curious, you can't go wrong - ""The  Changeling"" ranks up with the original version of ""The  Haunting"" and ""The Uninvited"" as the best examples of the  supernatural ever brought to the screen.",969235200,13,1761,4.514285714285714

It was made on a shoestring budget of $6 million, but with its creepy atmosphere and murder mystery-style story, not to mention a sterling cast (George C. Scott and Melvyn Douglas) it overcomes any obstacles and should be remembered alongside other creepy movies such as The Haunting.
I saw this movie the first time when I was about 7 and had problems being alone in the dark for quite a long time after. I slept with a nightlight until I was almost 12 just because of this movie.

This story is about a man's love of music(a  composer)and he seeks comfort in it after his wife and child were killed  tragically by a truck.  He decides to seek a new home to find solace and  work on his music writing.  While he is settling in his new 'mansion'and  working round the clock, he discovers he's not alone. Need I say  more.....The connection between a broken-hearted father and the ghost of a  lost child clash in a very deadly twist of fate.  I suggest you see it and  I am glad that I became a fan of George C. Scott.",944956800,4,705,4.072992700729927
71457,5,0783116926,"When I first saw this movie, I was alone and it scared me as well as kept me enthralled with the story. I have since seen it a few more times. And yes, it still gives me chills, even describing it to others gives me goose  bumps.  When I hear people talking about scary movies, I always, always  recommend they watch this. The main reason I find it so terrifying...it  could happen to you.",944179200,4,389,4.216216216216216
71458,1,0783116926,"The movie was boring and lame. It did not hold my interest at any point and the ending was confusing. George C Scott was okay....it wasn't that great of a movie though. If you want to see a old good movie, get Dracula,I  Saw what you did, House on haunted hill or The Haunting (1963).",943833600,,284,4.163636363636364
71459,5,0783116926,"George C. Scott's typical stoicism gives way to subtle sympathy in this chiller.  Cinematographically, this film is perfect.  The sadness Scott portrays in the beginning NYC scenes are reflected flawlessly by the city's  cold architecture, grey weather and director's camera angles.  Throughout  the film, one feels helpless and chilled by the story.  Unfortunately, I  saw this only recently for the first time--on the original VHS tape from  its home-video release in 1979.  This needs to be put on DVD.",943660800,4,505,5.291139240506329
71460,5,0783116926,"I own this video! My friend bought it for me for my birthday! Whenever I want a good scare.....I turn it on! It frightens me ever time I watch it!  There are certain aspects that movie makers used to make this very  realistic. The setting is great, the use of the ghost in the house and the  scene with the Seance. The Seance scene is the scariest moment in horror  film history, I will tell you no more. But this scene makes you want to go  crazy after you see it. And the aftermath of the seance......YOU WILL FLIP  OUT WHEN YOU DISCOVER WHAT THE LEAD CHARACTER DOES. You must go into this  movie with an open mind. If you go in with the attitude that this cannot  compare to other scary movies....then you are doomed! But you have to watch  it thinking that it is scary! It is fun to be scared by this show! I cannot  impress on anyone how important it is to see this movie. You can even rent  it before you buy it. But you will end up wanting to own this special  classic. YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT!",941414400,4,998,4.087628865979381
71461,5,0783116926,"I love horror!  The first time I saw this movie it scared me out of my wits!  Brilliantly acted with a supurb plot.  George C. Scott and Trish  Vandervere couldn't have acted better.  The film is so gripping from  beginning to end there's never a dull moment. It is a must see if you are  truly into horror, not blood and gore which tends to be silly, laughable  and completely unbievable.  It will scare the daylights out of you and keep  you coming back for more!!!",941241600,2,467,4.325581395348837
71462,5,0783116926,"I first stumbled across this movie over 12 years ago when my brothers and I went to the local theater.  They went to see a karate flick and I saw this one on my own.  I was definitely in for a treat!  My wife and I saw it  a few years ago and she loved it!  Great acting, photography and a plot  that kept you guessing the whole time.  The scene where the ball comes  bouncing down the stairs is unforgettable!  A treasure to watch with a date  or spouse.  I wish more films were made like this.  Last weekend I saw The  Sixth Sense and it reminded me of this movie.  The quality is very close.  Enjoy!",939772800,,602,3.983050847457627

Who needs all the blood and gore of todays horror  movies.. I sure don't!

71464,5,0783116926,"I was young when I first saw this movie, but it has always stuck with me as my favorite haunting movie of all. It was the best movie for sleepovers, Halloween, and all-night movie bashes. I still remember being terrified to  take a bath because I was certain that somone or something would try and  drown me.  I believe that growing up a rented this movie at least 20  times, so now I am just going to buy it! I totally urge any horror movie  buff to see this movie ASAP.",936230400,,471,4.131868131868132
71465,5,0783116926,"I haven't seen this film for over a year, therefore can't believe the chill that is sweeping over my body as I write this.  Unlike so many supernatural films today, The Changeling largely ignores special effects  and instead, draws on our deepest and most simple fears - the dark, or  rather what's in it. I can't forget the terror I felt when George Lucas'  character threw the ball up the stairs out of the way... ...to find it  returned to him from out of the darkness a few seconds later, bouncing  loudly down the stairs to land at his feet.",935452800,,546,4.41
71466,5,0783116926,"I saw this movie when it first came out in 1979 at the movie theater. My arm was scratched up from my date's long fingernails. ADVICE: Never take a date with long fingernails to a horror movie. The scariest scene for me was  when the wet ball bounced down the stairs. The tragedy of the child's  murder is depressing, but hey... it's only a movie.",932169600,,347,4.323076923076923

It should be clear to every unfortunate soul reading, these films are, respectively, the Father, Son and Holy  Spirit of Horror.  This film is highly recommended, as are the others.  Please, I beg of you:  Watch It !!!!!!",932083200,3,326,4.649122807017544
