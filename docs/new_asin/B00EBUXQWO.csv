8603632,4,B00EBUXQWO,"The set-up is simple. A fat young under-cover cop has to lose weight to be able to pass as a male fashion model in order to investigate drug dealing in the fashion world. Of course a pretty female designer is an ex-class mate who is put in charge of his diet and make-over.

Crude humor is not my usual taste, but this movie is truly funny and there is a lot of variety in the jokes, not just crude sight gags. Watching the cop try to lose weight and learn to walk the runway is both painful and hilarious. In particular this is a great call when your girl wants to watch a dreaded ""chick flick"" and you want to watch an action movie. You will both be happy and may soften you up for some other Korean dramas and movies, if you are not already familiar for them.

This film will inevitably get re-made in America, it is that good. But watch the original and get your laughs now.",1420675200,,878,4.158823529411765
