6991868,5,B00SPWRSU0,"Outstanding series, one I watched in my youth! Each episode begins with the rapid firing of the Rifleman's Winchester, which set the tone for each show. And, for a half hour show, the stories are great! And family friendly ... definitely recommend this series to all! And I recommend you buy each season in its two part format; the combined season set is almost $20 dollars more  (at the time of this writing) than buying it in two parts.",1489104000,,438,4.544303797468355

6991877,4,B00SPWRSU0,"I enjoyed this excellent cowboy series on television from 1958 to 1963.  Because it is the best, I wish that they have cleaned it more completely from little white and black ""dust.""  From time to time there were some frames that had long white lines.

6991907,5,B00SPWRSU0,"This show was such a fantastic hit back then. You have to get a kick out of the way each show starts with 6' 9"" Star, Chuck Connors. This is a family show with plenty punch to it's story line. Each episode is only approximately 27 minutes, but in those days each episode was completed, didn't drag on, unfinished like a soap opera and was like a mini movie. Simply unbelievable & wonderfully satisfying! Buy from AMAZON & you won't be disappointed!!",1444608000,5,449,4.487804878048781

6991913,5,B00SPWRSU0,"This was one of my favorite westerns when I was growing up! Now I am able to purchase season 1 Vol. 1 & 2. This series follows rancher Lucas McLain & his son Mark through the growing pains of the west. Lucas is a man of strong morals and tries to instill them in his son. But as is the case throughout the west trouble was usually just around the corner. To combat the bad guys,Lucas makes an adjustment to his rifle that allows him to rapidly fire his and therefore his moniker The Rifleman. Excellent sound and quality!",1438041600,6,521,4.2727272727272725
