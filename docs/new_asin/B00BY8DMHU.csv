5681947,4,B00BY8DMHU,"Pretty funny.  It has a very Kevin Smith tone about it.
Picture quality of the movie is good.  Surround sound is meh.
The disc doesn't have subtitles.
Special features were also very sub par.  No audio commentary and the making of has horrible sound.",1378080000,,250,4.636363636363637
5681948,1,B00BY8DMHU,"Plan 9 From Outer Space is generally considered the worst film ever made. Now, it has some competition. I had never heard of this before, but I saw Felicia Day and I figured it had to be good. I guess everyone can have an off day, but this is an excessively off day. To begin with, there is little to no writing involved. Apparently, they thought an endless string of meaningless, crass profanity would be really funny. For anyone who isn't in the seventh grade, however, it just comes off as strained. The characters are so generic there really wasn't a point in naming them. It is basically a cast of extras. Nevertheless, I did sit through the banal dialogue, ignoring the embarrassingly awful writing until I got to the point where ""Generic Asian Guy #1"" kicks ""Stereotypical Power Female"" in the side during a ridiculous fight. I could ignore the other idiotic stuff, but having a man hitting a woman was too much. I have no idea how it ends, and frankly I couldn't care less. Avoid this awful mess at all costs, and hopefully no one will realize Felicia Day was in this garbage so it doesn't damage her otherwise outstanding career.",1377648000,,1138,4.583333333333333
5681949,1,B00BY8DMHU,"This is a horrible film.  The big problem is a character, Seth, who is just way too over the top and annoying throughout the entire run of the movie.  It gets in the way of what could have been at least a 2 1/2 star movie.  Skip it!",1377388800,,232,3.7916666666666665
5681950,5,B00BY8DMHU,"I loved this movie!  But, I'm not sure if people outside of nerd/geek culture will.  There's a lot of obscure gamer and scifi references that your every day person may not get.  Acting is not bad for some of the youtube stars that are in the movie and the professional ones are excellent.  Nice cameos also!  If you are a nerd/geek/gamer see the movie!",1376352000,4,352,4.4375
5681951,5,B00BY8DMHU,"Not a high production value film, but I giggled through the whole thing. Very enjoyable, and that is what truly matters.",1375315200,5,120,4.761904761904762
5681952,4,B00BY8DMHU,"Fun little indie film with a lot of great dialog.

It has a few rough edges, but the CG and make-up are top notch.

I wish I would have rented it instead of bought it though.  While it was a fun movie, I don't see myself rewatching it.",1374105600,2,235,3.8541666666666665
5681953,4,B00BY8DMHU,"This is a pretty good film, well worth the price. Clever premise and story with much better acting then you'd expect for it's production budget. Most of the colorful language fit the situations, but there were some times that it was a bit overused and detracted from the story. It has a good beginning, middle, and end, and is peppered with small humorous situations that will make you laugh, or at least chuckle. All in all it was quite entertaining.",1373932800,4,451,4.65
5681954,5,B00BY8DMHU,"Take a small group of people, that don't like each other or their job, stick them in a small top secret bunker, make them sleep deprived, and expect them to save the world...all day and everyday.  Laughed out loud too many times to count. A great situational character driven comedy with excellent performances by the cast.  Had me drawing parallels between the characters in the movie and the people I have/do work with.",1373932800,10,421,4.7534246575342465
5681955,5,B00BY8DMHU,"""Rock Jocks"" is a hilarious and knowing send up of a work environment where the conflicts and duties of a strange high tech project that combines a corporate, government/regulated milieu with area 51 myth inspired, whacked out, 21st century, diverse, recovering, stressed out work force.  Think of ""Office Space"", ""Buckaroo Bonzai"", and even Monty Python rolled together. Very imaginative and a lot of fun!",1373932800,4,406,5.34375
5681956,5,B00BY8DMHU,"This movie was so funny! I don't know why more people haven't heard of it! Felicia Day, Jason Mews and the whole cast are awesome in it and I laughed the entire time. If you are a nerd who loves spaceships and needs a good funny film to watch - this is the droid (movie) you are looking for!",1370044800,7,291,3.9491525423728815

5681974,1,B00BY8DMHU,"No ammount of acting or special effects can save this bad film. Because of the high caliber actors who are trying so desperately to save it in every scene and expert directing and special effects, this movie never collapses into a hilariously bad B-movie. It just dangles there in a helpless state of less than meteocre. Slap-stick comedies are not supposed to be BORING! The blame goes to Paul V. Seetachitt, the writer/director. Dramas can be boring as sand but still accomplish telling a story about a group of people and maybe making you interested in them. Comedies, on the other hand, are hard as nails because the goal is to make people laugh. Seetachitt may simply have not realized how enormously difficult it is to make a successfull comedy.",1392768000,,751,4.7846153846153845
5681975,4,B00BY8DMHU,"OK the special effects aren't anything to write home about but the story is good and the acting is better than average. It does the ""hours of boredom sandwiched between seconds of stark raving terror"" vibe very well. Having spent countless hours in command posts both hoping and fearing that something would happen I could see the dynamic very well. Its a fun flick and well work watching.",1388448000,2,389,4.735294117647059
5681976,2,B00BY8DMHU,"Felicia Day couldn't even save this turkey. The writing and humor is juvenile...it just isn't funny. Conceptually it was a good idea and they could have really taken the ball and run with it, but they fumbled. Cheap, cheesy and dumbed down. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that Felicia Day always does a good job, even with lousey material to work with. Save your money FD fans, because even she can't save this mess.",1387411200,,439,4.432098765432099
5681977,1,B00BY8DMHU,"I so wanted to love this show. I purchased it, and we couldn't even finish watching. We are not a household that swears much, so the profanity being over the top made it unwatchable. It just wasn't funny. It had so much promise. Love Felicia Day, so very sorry to give it such a bad review. PS. We enjoy The Guild, so it's not like we can't stand a bad word or two.",1382140800,,365,4.013698630136986
5681978,5,B00BY8DMHU,"Rock Jocks is a campy, twisted sci-fi romp set in a top-secret facility where an unlikely group of slacker/nerds are tasked with saving the world from meteors -- on a budget that hasn't increased since about 1958.  This indy film has an outstanding cast and quick dialogue that is always surprising.  Writer/Director Paul Seetachitt offers bizarre and unexpected plot twists, along with biting commentary about government, relationships, and Jesus.",1381536000,3,448,5.478260869565218
5681979,4,B00BY8DMHU,"I love just about everything Felicia Day does, and I can tell her humor spilled over into ""Rock Jocks"" too.  I tried to get a local viewing of the movie via a ""Tuggs"" promotion, but when I could not generate enough ticket sales to make that happen, I bought a copy myself.  This one might have too much profanity if you're going to have small children watching it with you, but it's perfect for a quick fix of Science Fiction viewing.  Might work even better as something to have on during an Evening Convention Room Party to get several conversations started regarding the film - there's lots of genre-references and tech-talk to keep group of science-savvy watchers interested for its hour-and-half run time :)",1380672000,,712,4.725806451612903

A whole lot of fun to watch, even if the language bordered on Clerks territory, with solid performances put in by the cast. An amusing lore to the world of the story combined with some laugh-out-loud moments of humor make this a great ride from beginning to end.

If you need expensive special effects and A-list celebrities, no, this isn't for you.  But if you enjoy small films with enjoyable casts and quirky stories, especially the sci-fi type, then you should give Rock Jocks a view.",1378598400,3,664,4.462809917355372
