8419459,5,B0049W0GUO,Bill Nye is always a huge success with my students.  He presents relevant information in a compelling way that students enjoy.  It's not a boring lecture or too technical. Rather it is fun and interesting and at the same time very scientific.,1423612800,,242,4.738095238095238
8419460,4,B0049W0GUO,"After several attempts of trying to teach my boys about pulleys, wheels, and simple machines, they just weren't getting it.  Planes, screws, levers....it was too confusing for them to keep them all straight and apply it to everyday items.  Bill Nye to the rescue!!  It took a couple of views, but they finally got it.  As usual...I do think the DVDs are overpriced, so it cost Disney a star on this review.",1364947200,3,406,4.597222222222222
8419461,5,B0049W0GUO,This Bill Nye video was just what I needed to compliment my simple machines unit. The students loved it! (I teach 2nd grade.),1362355200,2,125,4.478260869565218
8419462,4,B0049W0GUO,"Seemed like a decent grab bag gift to get, so I got it, and it's a DVD, but Bill Nye is pretty awesome.",1361664000,,103,3.5217391304347827
8419463,5,B0049W0GUO,"I never actually bought this from Amazon, becuase UPS failed to deliver it to my office, and, after a few days lost in shipping, sent it back to the seller.  I borrowed a copy from a local high school and used it.  The failure of Amazon and UPS notwithstanding, it is a very good and entertaining video on simple machines.",1360540800,,322,4.35
8419464,5,B0049W0GUO,"Bill Nye has a way of bringing science concepts into my classroom in a fun and engaging way! There are many concepts that need more explanation and he does it in a way that illustrates to children the how's and why's of science. There are also some things we cannot do in our classrooms, like go to a volcano. This series takes you inside one, under it, and explains how they are created. Wonderful science resource for any teacher.",1345248000,,432,4.481012658227848
