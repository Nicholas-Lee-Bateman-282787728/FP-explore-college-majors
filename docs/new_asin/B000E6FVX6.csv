However, the whole video is talking about some principles of microphones, signal path, how to connect those gears etc. I thought this video suppose to show us on how to set up our home studio. It should cover topics such as installing diffuser, sound absorber, how to choose materials and so on.",1208736000,,394,4.984848484848484
