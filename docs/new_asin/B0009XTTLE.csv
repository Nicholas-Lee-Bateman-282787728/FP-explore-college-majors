8069794,5,B0009XTTLE,"All the reviewers panned this.  I loved it.  Granted, it is made from chunks of a tv series, so it is choppy.  But I adore the Witcher games, the books that have been translated so far, and this movie. I recommend it for any fan, just accept it is not a Hollywood blockbuster and enjoy it for what it is.  Plus, their version of the bard, Dandelion, is wonderful and much more believable.",1393804800,,388,4.273972602739726
8069795,1,B0009XTTLE,"Spliced together from scenes of a 13 episode TV series run... good luck on that... so now I'll add more to hit 20 words and mention that I've viewed the 13 episodes with fan dubbing which weren't that bad, i.e. still recognizeable as to which short story they originate from, mainly those found in the ""Last Wish"" collection, along with bits from ""The Blood of Elves"".",1341705600,4,368,4.590909090909091
8069796,1,B0009XTTLE,"If you are a fan of The Witcher (either the book, ""Last Wish"", or the videogame), don't bother with this tripe. Sloppily edited from a TV series, with stiff acting, laugh-out-loud special effects, and shoddy camerawork, this is a disaster of ... well, I'd say ""epic proportions"", but there's really nothing epic about it.

If you aren't a fan, there's even less reason to see it.

Avoid this trainwreck.",1240012800,3,403,4.826086956521739
8069797,3,B0009XTTLE,"I've read the book (at least the one translated into English) and have the PC game.  I would love to have seen the entire TV series from which this film was patched together.  The ""patching"" is somewhat haphazard and the film lacks continuity. Their special effects aren't too great. Don't care for the translation of the title.  ""The Hexer"" doesn't cut it. the ""Witcher"", which is the title of the computer game is a better one.  All in all, however, it is a fascinating film, the more so because it feels so ""foreign"".  They should have given their title actor a better wig.  It looks too phoney.",1232150400,2,598,4.542056074766355
8069798,1,B0009XTTLE,"Andrzej Sapkowski is one of the most popular writers in Poland. He has been translated into many languages (but unfortunately not yet into English), and as a fan of fantasy literature I'd proudly put his 'Hexer' series next to the works of Raymond E. Feist, Glen Cook, George R.R. Martin or even master Tolkien himself.

However, the movie is as terrible as the books are wonderful. Sapkowski's comments were disregarded by the movie makers, and later he 'diswoned' the movie. The story was cut to pieces, mixed in almost a random order and spiced by idiotic twists from the movie directors. Special effects are on the lowest TROMA level. Music is hideous. The only redeeming thing is the leading actor, Michal Zebrowski, who at least looks and acts like Hexer Geralt. But while good, he is not oustanding, and definetly cannot save the movie.

If you can get a hold of the books it was based on, please do so. But stay away from this movie adaptation, it is twice as bad as you can imagine after my review.",1128729600,31,1007,4.620111731843576
