8400007,1,B003M1PSVA,"Previouslly I gave this item a good review. Well upon receiving it I must retract my earlier statements. The quality of this DVD is horrible. It looks like it came straight from youtube and off of a computer screen. The description says Rosie O'Donnell part 2. I thought it mean the whole Lena part from 1998 and that part one was her appearance from 1997. It leaves out her singing Stormy Weather, her last television appearance singing. And skips to the interview part. This is not an official DVD. I hope Blue Note or somebody will put Lena's Gap Commercial and both of her entire Rosie Appearances on DVD oneday, on a nice clear transfer. Don't buy this unless you are desperate to have something on Lena.",1282521600,4,709,4.590551181102362
