1803113,5,B00007986M,"Way, way realistic -
My boyffiend (now husband) wrestled in high-school. Watching this movie, I re-lived the competitions, and all of the emotions associated with the weight issue -- and all the family dynamics, too.
Highly recommended!",1037491200,,236,5.405405405405405
1803114,4,B00007986M,"I loved it!
Although Reversal is a film that's focused on more than wrestling -- it doesn't leave you wanting for mat action.
Great cinematography, too.",1037491200,,152,4.884615384615385
1803115,4,B00007986M,"Being a former wrestler and now a father of three wrestlers, this movie meant a great deal to me. The wrestling action was authentic ( a first in the industry!), the story was gripping and the acting was superb. I also listen to the soundtrack on cd for easy listening and to help motivate my young wreslers on our way to a competition. The story is set in a beautiful area of our country and the fall season  scenery was breathtaking. In our circle of wrestling families, the movie was received with mixed emotions, only because of its honesty in how it dealt with the sport of wrestling and some of its more unpleasant aspects. The movie was honest and that is what is important. And , even more important is the fact that this movie portarys how not to deal with the issue of weight loss and the most important point of all . . . how valuable, significant and long-lasting are the bonds between a father and a son and the fact that we should never, ever take them for granted. Thanks, Reversal, for an awesome movie that I am proud to have in my library.",1037491200,3,1057,4.338383838383838
1803116,5,B00007986M,"Reversal is a fantastic film about sacrificing all to be the best.  It is allot more than just a great sports movie, it is about a touching father and son relationship that really makes you appreciate parents trying to do what they think is best for their children.
Even not being a sports fanatic, I appreciate this movie on so many levels.  It makes me realize the sacrifices people make to be the best at what they do.
The wrestling action is great and truly realistic, there were many moments watching the DVD that I replayed the wrestling action and watched it again and again.
This DVD is a must for every family, the added features on the DVD make this a must have in any DVD collection.",1037404800,3,694,4.4140625
1803117,5,B00007986M,"This movie is about what a father wants for his son.  The story is about life and death and building a champion.  Anyone who has ever competed in any sport will be moved.

1803118,5,B00007986M,"I have been involved with the sport of wrestling for more than a 13 years, both as a wrestler and a high school varsity coach.
All I can say is this movie is a MUST SEE, no matter what sport you follow. This movie crosses the sports barrier. Although REVERSAl is centered around wrestling as a theme, it is more about a father who will do anything to help his son succeed! I have never experienced such realistic, raw wrestling talent from the movie industry before REVERSAL; likewise, no movie with a sport as a foundation has ever taken me on such an emotional roller coaster. In fact the last movie to send me on such an emotional roller coaster was TITANIC -- the highest grossing movie of all time (at least until Star Wars came out for the 2nd time).
THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE -- DON'T MISS OUT -- DON'T MISS THE MESSAGE!!",1037318400,,827,4.3076923076923075

1803143,5,B00007986M,"This movie gives you a deeper look into The World Of Amateur Wrestling! In my opinion it goes even deeper than ""Vision Quest"". This movie was underrated and obviously did not get promoted very well, or I definitely would've seen it theaters when it came out. I'm not gonna blab the plot, you're just gonna have to watch it for yourself. I will just say that it has a little bit of everything in it. If you were ever a wrestler in your lifetime you will definitely be able to relate to a lot of what you see, and I recommend that you watch it. If you enjoyed ""Vision Quest"" &  ""Legendary"" then you will definitely enjoy ""Reversal""!!!",1343347200,,632,4.3559322033898304
1803144,5,B00007986M,"This move was an excellent example of real life wrestling.  Having wrestled all my life, and having wrestled all 4 years at the University level, this movie brings it home.  Gave me goose bumps.  My only critizim is that the Coach, great guy, was unlike my real Coaches, the real Coaches push you, as a wrestler, to your very level of existance, and may there be mercy on your soul if you don't think wrestling is about competing.  There are only one of two reason why you are in a wrestling room, to compete to be a national champion or you are just flat out crazy.  Coach said on the first day of practice ""There are two people I fear in life, God and me. . . gentlement welcome to the Marine Corps of sports!""  Make no mistake this movie depicts some of the trails, tribulation, and dedication we, as wrestlers, make to be the best, b/c as second sucks!  It shows how we grew-up.  Enjoy a great flick!",1288396800,,904,4.3076923076923075
1803145,5,B00007986M,"My friend showed me this movie back in 2003.  Most of the people on the wrestling team were quite demoralized about the sport was about since all it summed down to was dedicating yourself to a sport that nobody cares about.  This is even mentioned in the movie by the mother.

Most coaches or parents don't seem to know what wrestlers seem to go through nor do they seem to care.  The greatest part of the movie is when the dad is proud of his son for quitting.",1281139200,,461,4.204545454545454
1803146,5,B00007986M,"A little truth in advertising before I start. I graduated from Trinity High school in Washington, PA where this movie was made. That being said it was about time somebody made a movie about this sport that was accurate and considering that the actor were not professionals, they did a more than adequate job and were believable. I've seen some reviews that criticized Danny Mousetis' acting abilities, i.e. ""he mumbles"". I guess they have never seen a James Dean movie or a young Marlon Brando. That is who he reminded me of. I think it was essential that the use of real grapplers to show what goes on on the mats as well as off the mats. Danny Mousetis is a 3rd generation champion wrestler, who actually DID wrestle for Wash Hi, and I'm sure he experienced the same feelings to some extent as Leo did in the film.

The tales of binging and purging in this film are accurate, and I remember ""praying to the porcelain goddess"" on more than one occasion. I'm glad that this film brought this to the forefront and that since I was wrestler, many new rules have been put in place to safeguard the athletes against abusing their bodies. I remember also donning the plastic suits and sitting in a wrestling room with a cold bag of ice on the thermostat to keep the heat pumping full blast, sitting in plastic sheeting sweating my butt off, (since that was the only place where I had anything left)

But this more about a relationship than it is wrestling. It could have been a movie about any sport. Frustrated athletes don't help their kids by trying to live their lives through the kid, and I see this as a parent of an athlete. I think I enjoyed sports more because my Dad didn't come around and hassling me about it. He was too busy earning a living for a wife and 8 kids to  be living through his kids. He didn't approve of the weight loss, but he never tried to make me stop. I remember some father's showing up in our wrestling room and slapping his son because he was not giving it his all. I think any parent who has a kid ought to watch this film and try to remember that sometimes you have to just trust the kid to make the decision, and that you won't always be around to ""carry him on your shoulder"". Please see this, Mom and Dad! You won't be sorry.

Finally, I think the kids did a great job. This movie was made in 21 DAYS! It is an honest film by honest people. The cinematography is wonderful (although it always seemed to be in the fall, when wrestling season usually starts when the leaves have already fallen and ends in late winter) I loved the shots of Ohiopyle and the ""still mills"". The soundtrack was great, but foremost, the wrestling action is very well done, these guys were going at it!

See this movie!!!",1278892800,,2731,4.368110236220472
1803147,2,B00007986M,"Wrestling is a huge part of my life, and so I was naturally excited that it was the subject of a motion picture.  The involvement and casting of actual wrestlers means that there are parts of the film that are very real.  The wrestling scenes themselves feel authentic and they're fun to watch.  The overbearing father is something I've witnessed quite often.  The burnt-out athlete?  I've seen it.  But for most of the people I know who wrestle, it has been an enormously positive experience.  The question is... if so few stories about wrestling are told in film, why tell THIS particular story?  Especially when wrestling could be the backdrop for so many other screenplays that don't focus on just the oppressive view of our sport.  To be fair, Reversal wouldn't be so maligned if it were a counterpoint to other positive wrestling movies.

So kudos to the filmmakers for making a movie about wrestling, albiet one with amateur acting and a dark uninspiring story, but next time let's not market it as something our sport's community should proudly rally around to represent wrestling to the world.",1278028800,,1102,4.8449197860962565
1803148,1,B00007986M,The fact that so many lauded this dull effort shows the dirth of good wrestling movies.  I tried to like this-I love anything about wrestling-but really struggled with it.  I think that some of the positive(and there are many) reviews were from guys like me who deluded themselves that this was a good movie.  I tried-I couldn't.,1240531200,,329,4.7368421052631575
1803149,5,B00007986M,"I can't believe it. I'm giving this movie five stars out of five. I just finished watching it and I am just floored by it! I tried not to like it, but it slowly grew on me until I was in the zone.

Leo and his dad possess a very close father and son relationship, one that I think most sons would love to have or have had with their dads. However the dad is quite demanding and aggressive in his approach to his son's success as a future big-time wrestler. He incessantly pushes and pushes and pushes his son toward excellence, even at the expense of his son's health and mental well-being. The dad is not a mean man by any stretch, he is just driven ... driven to see his son attain what he could not.

I don't care how strong a person is or how much resolve one has the capacity for, you can only stretch a rubberband so taut before it breaks. Leo patiently endures the demands of his dad because his need for approval is strong, yet there are dissenting voices 'shouting' from the sidelines (personified by his mom, girlfriend, and uncle) to get him to see that he is headed for disaster if he continues to put himself in peril in order to reach his elusive goal.

The inner turmoil that ensues causes Leo to make a decision he deeply regrets, and nothing is the same again.

I have been a huge Vision Quest fan for years and years. Reversal began slowly, and I thought to myself, ""this will never measure up to Vision Quest."" But I was wrong. This movie is a much better product than Vision Quest because it is more realistic with regard to the details. Gut-wrenching is putting it mildly, pun intended. The final wrestling scene is profound - especially since there is no music playing during the match. You have to see it to know what I mean. The end of the movie is very powerful. If you want to view an extremely quality flick about the rigors of making weight, peer/parent pressures, and the fallout of choices made, purchase this movie!",1230854400,,1946,4.352617079889807
1803160,5,B00007986M,This is a great movie about wrestling.  It tells the truth of what can happen to a child if pushed to hard.  It is great and enjoyable.,1227571200,,135,3.962962962962963
1803161,4,B00007986M,This was a great movie. It makes you very aware of the way things were done in that time. With the new rules now I feel that wrestling is a safer sport ( not that you don't have the kids that still take laxatives and starve themselves). The new rules just make it a little harder. The story was very down to earth. We can't make our children live out OUR hopes and dreams. It has to be something that they want. And this movie proves that you have to want it very badly and you have to work extra hard for it. You don't have to spend a lot of money to make a good family movie.,1208563200,,577,3.8983050847457625
1803162,1,B00007986M,"Can I give this zero stars?  Why do we indulge quitters in our society? If you know nothing about wrestling, don't watch this film as your introduction.  I wrestled in high school and college and have been coaching for 24 years. If you are part of the fraternity of wrestling you will know that this movie has passed from our lore.  People still watch Visionquest, because it illustrates the sacrifice and determination that is required to be a champion in sport or life.

This film is the same old tired dramatization of the angst of a kid who didn't have what it took and foisted the blame on everyone but himself.  The saddest thing about it is that the folks involved probably made more money than any hard working high school coach will make in a career.  My coaches pushed me extremely hard, and because of that everything in my life has been easier.

This story is pathetic.  I live for the day that it goes out of print.
It is a blueprint for how to lose in sport and life.",1202688000,,981,4.3812154696132595
1803163,2,B00007986M,"Reversal tells the story of high school wrestler Leo, who is trained by his father. I enjoyed watching other wrestling movies, like Vision Quest and Hadley's Rebellion and I'm glad I saw Reversal but there are more than a few problems with it.

The film's biggest fault is its lack of focus. It's not sure if it wants the main story to be the sacrifices teenage athletes have to make, or Leo's relationship with his girlfriend, or his father.

Also, a lot of the characters are paper-thin; more specifically, Jimi Petulla is spectacularly miscast. As the father/coach he should be a blue-collar coal worker who spends his time swabbing down the wrestling room floor but instead he looks as if he's just walked off the set of Desperate Housewives. In fact, he's such a nice guy it is hard to see what Leo is rebelling against.

Danny Mousetis as Leo is fine but he's so grumpy and sullen it's hard to have much sympathy for him.

The cinematography is great and the wrestling action is for real but this is not enough to save a movie which has so many acting and structural problems.

As the DVD extras show, a ducumentary on high school grappling is what is really needed. A wrestling equivalent of Friday Night Lights is something I would pay good money to see.",1181952000,,1262,4.566371681415929
1803164,5,B00007986M,"While Vision quest is sort of a classic, funny wrestling movie, Reversal is much more accurate and realistic. If you are a wrestler or just want to know what some of your wrestling friends go through, this movie really hits the nail on the head. The story is deep, and goes beyond just beating a ""bad guy"" and everyone going home happy.

Also note that the wrestling done in the movie is real, not choreographed. So you're looking at some quality wrestling here.",1138924800,2,462,4.566265060240964
1803165,3,B00007986M,"I thought this was the best movie I have ever seen about amateur wrestling. It shows both the good and the bad of the sport. It takes on the obsessive values and delves into the eating disorders that are almost encouraged. It also is a story about family and love.

This is a small independant film. Most of the actors from what I have read are not professional actors and it sometimes shows. It is based on a true story. The amateur wrestling is very real and done really well.

This movie has been recommended by amateur wrestling champions like Kurt Angle, Cael Sanderson and the great Danny Hodge.",1137628800,2,601,4.504587155963303
1803166,4,B00007986M,"Even as a non-wrestler, I enjoyed this film.  It has a compelling father-son story that elevates it above being a sports movie.  That being said, the wrestling was some of the best sports action that I have seen on film in its raw but technical feel.  The photography in this film was good, but the movie does feel at time like a good effort from film school, especially in the pacing.  I was not expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised and moved by the story.  It is far better than most big studio productions, despite a few imperfections.",1131667200,4,548,4.494949494949495
1803167,3,B00007986M,"I'm a former high school wrestler who loved my sport. I'm only aware of three movies made in the last 20-30 years about wrestling-Take Down with Lorenzo Lamos, Vision Quest, and now Reversal.

I was very excited when I found out that there was another movie made about wrestling. However, I would caution someone to rent Reversal before buying it.

A blurb from Olympian Carl Lewis says this is a ""family film."" It's not. I'm glad I didn't watch it with my children. It shows teens smoking marijuana and underage drinking, conversations between boys about sex, a teen buying condoms while hitting on an older lady, and some mild profanity. The movie is fine to watch if teens are older, but it's not for children.

In my opinion, Reversal is more about a ""coming of age"" movie where the protagonist happens to be a wrestler than a movie about wrestling.

This is an independent film so, the screen play, soundtrack, and acting were a little less than professional. However, the extra features are really good. For example, the producer/writer and the main actor meet with a fitness trainer and nutritionist that puts them on a six day workout for wrestlers and an eating plan to keep one's weight in check and energy level up. This is worth buying the movie and keeping it. In fact, I intend to watch this section a second time and take notes.",1122940800,29,1343,4.654008438818566
1803168,3,B00007986M,"There are some aspects of this film that were outstanding. The wrestling scenes are the most realistic I've viewed in a movie. The movie gives a good account of the sacrifices it takes to be an accomplished athlete. Finally, Jimi Petulla's performance as the father and coach is very touching and memorable.

However, other aspects of the movie seem to be right out of an ABC Afternoon Special. Danny Mousetis's role as the son was unconvincing. I don't want to give away scenes but the son seemed much too mature, much too good, for a conflicted 17 year old. It appears that the film writers wanted to create a likeable character but in doing so, left something important out. Other characters, especially the mother, seemed flat - as if little thought was given to develop their character. There were some scenes that I thought I've seen right out of the Afternoon Special.",1098057600,4,875,4.756578947368421
1803169,5,B00007986M,"Since I have seen just about every movie at my video store, I was forced to look around the ""out for a while now"" section of my town's video store; that's how I found the movie Reversal.  I'm glad I did.
No huge Hollywood budget was needed to make this film; the storyline and actors manage to provide all of the bells and whistles themselves.  I really liked the message behind this movie:
As a parent, I am well aware of the fact parents want their kids to have a better life than they had.  As the father in the movie states: ""In our effort to not make the same mistakes our parent's made, we end up making a bunch of new ones.""  Not sure I have the quote right word for word, but close.
This movie has some very funny parts, extremely sad parts, and some parts that truly make you think about what you want out of life.
All and all, this movie had it goin' on.  There were a few sexual comments (talking about condoms and getting laid, etc.) that did not need to be in the movie; that was the only thing about the movie I didn't like.

1803180,5,B00007986M,I LUV WREASTLING \AND THIS IS ONE OF THE ONLY WRESTLING MOVIES OTHER THAN VISION QUEST,1080345600,,86,4.4375
1803181,5,B00007986M,"This film works on many different fronts. In one instance it can be viewed as a tribute to the sport of wrestling. It could also be seen as a cautionary tale about parents putting their own wishes over their childrens' needs. On a deeper level it brings to light issues about abuse, and the psychological trauma it leave on the victims. Critics and fans alike have praised this film for many different things, and many valid messages are expressed through this seemingly simple story about a high-school wrestler and his father/coach coming to terms with one another.
As other reviews have mentioned, the wrestling action is very authentic. By using real collegiate wrestlers (instead of actors pretending to wrestle) the matches show off the speed, intricacy, and awesome physical demands required of the sport.
The wrestling mindset is also heavily explored here, with mantras like ""hard work always pays off"" and ""the world is better for winners"", writer/producer/cast member Jimi Petulla details the mental aspects of motivation, desire, and focus in a sport which is so unsympathetic about dividing the winners from the losers. Petulla plays the main character's father, who after feeling emotionally deserted by his own father, seeks to build his own son into an undisputed winner and champion who will not suffer the same pitfalls and frustrations he has had to endure in life.
The cinematography highlighting a small Pennsylvania coal-mining town is beautifully done, and the natural dialog between the characters enhances the realistic setting of Anytown, USA. One gets the feeling that this same story has been played out countless times in small towns across the country, and will continue to repeat itself as long as fathers & sons & sports exist.
One complaint I had was with the unclear motivation of the main character's rival (who I belive is played by a national chamption at 119lbs.). In some scenes he appears to be a compassionate team-player, and other times he appears as a cold, calculating aggressor willing to trample on his teammates to fullfill his own agenda. Perhaps that duality was meant to show the struggle that some wrestlers have in switching on and off the competitiveness instilled within them. Aggression on the mat is to be tempered by being a gentleman and good citizen off the mat - this is something I think most wrestling coaches preach, and Petulla displays that wonderfully through pep-talks to his peewee wrestlers and his own son early on in the film.
I would have liked to see more of the wrestling action, but utimately this film is not about wrestling alone. Also, I would have liked to see the alternate ending make the final cut, however the quality of the film and its unconventional ending left me satisfied in a bittersweet way.",1067558400,4,2783,4.987096774193549
1803182,4,B00007986M,"I'm a former wrestler myself and was very impressed with the raw and realistic portrayals in this movie.
It's not your Vision Quest, pinning Shute, yay for the good guy style movie, all glitz and glamour with a happy, feel good, obvious ending. It's a movie that deals with wrestling and sports in general on a different level. It especially focuses on the trend that seems prevalent nowadays of parents pushing their kids into sports and pushing too hard. It's a road that a lot of us will have to face when we become parents and want to live vicariously through our own kids.
It is a good movie for someone who wants to learn more about what wrestling really is outside the practice room. It shows that often times the toughest opponent a wrestler will face isn't the guy he's actually wrestling but the scale. Anyone who has wrestled can immediately empathize with this and outsiders will see how much more there is to the sport than two guys rolling around on the mat. The battles with weight loss have put the sport into a critical spotlight and this film helps show you some of the mental reasoning that goes in on a wrestler's mind and why they are willing to go through the pain and sacrifice.
Like I mentioned, in the end you don't feel your typical happy closure, you feel introspection, you question, you scrutinize, you think. Kudos to a movie that can have this kind of profound effect!",1057708800,4,1399,4.555555555555555

The story takes place in a small Pennsylvania coal town and closely portrays an American family as only an independent film can.  The film footage, style and soundtrack shames most 'big budget' productions.
It is enlightening to watch a movie that isn't about murder, capital crimes, adultry and violent drug/terrorist themes.  Additionally, this film isn't pushing any consumer products or services in some thinly veiled story-line pretense.

There is also no doubt in my mind that right now in families all across America there are fathers and sons who are living this story or something similar. This film is about a Dad who loves his son and wants only for him to do his best with what he has to work with and a son who loves his dad very much and want's to please him but has his own ideas about what he wants to do with his life. Some ads I've seen portray this as a wrestling movie and reviews of the movie by wrestlers seem to agree that some of the best amateur wrestling ever seen in movies is in this film. I have to agree.

The cinematography is tremendous, acting first class, and story exceptional.  I reviewed the movie for a couple of web sites around a year ago, ...and loved it.  The DVD is also an exceptional value with all of the extra features that have gone into it.  I give the movie 5 deserving stars, it not only entertains, it provides value regards the development of parental relationships.  Beware that not everyone in the movie is perfect, this is not a Disney family, it is a real family with real struggles and real problems.  That is one of the beautiful things about the movie though.  Most every parent will appreciate this movie. Whether they know the sport of wrestling or not can relate to the characters.  In the tradition of Searching for Bobby Fisher and every bit as good, this movie will cause parents to ponder the relationship they have with their children.  It goes a step further however in that it also provides insights for the children as to why their parents often drive them to the extent they do. This movie made it to my top 100 list of all time and will rank on my top 10 list for this last year.  Enjoy it and learn from it...

It was one of my favorite movies when I was younger. Thinking about it now, that's because I was involved in so many activities requiring hard work, it was refreshing to see someone quit and for that to be okay. I appreciated the honesty of of the movie because I hadn't seen that before.

Years later I showed this to my friends, all also life long national level grapplers, and I had to turn it off early because it was so embarrassingly terrible. The acting couldn't be worse, I mean that. This movie holds a special place in my heart now, but part of that reason is because of how bad it is.",1521676800,,668,4.4227642276422765

7974459,1,B00007986M,This is a terrible movie. The main character (the wrestler) is a bad actor. I think he may be partially brain dead slow. His girlfriend is also terrible & really ugly! Lol.

In Montana there are strict rules on dieting, a Doctor determines the weight you can wrestle at. Of course getting to that weight in a responsible why, is also the job of the coach.",1391990400,,335,4.1692307692307695
