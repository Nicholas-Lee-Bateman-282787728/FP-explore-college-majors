3724989,4,B001NZ3E2C,"Kundalini yoga instructor and wellness consultant Kristen Eykel offers this short yoga routine for Arms & Shoulders, one of five DVDs in her 12-Minute Yoga Emergency Series.  The 12.5 minute yoga session is performed entirely in a seated position.  The workout begins in easy pose with neck stretches: lateral, up and down, and then neck rolls. Eykel follows this with a tricep stretch and then a seated twist, half lord of the fishes pose (she generally does not give names for the postures). Next you can see the influence of Eykel's Kundalini background with her inclusion of a seated torso twist, performed with the arms raised in a 90-degrees position for about one minute. Stretches for the arms and shoulders follow, including seated eagle arms and hands clasped behind the back. After this, Eykel performs another Kundalini-like move involving stretching alternate arms up with the breath. Eykel concludes this practice with wrist circles, stretches for the fingers, and a final ""sat nam.""

Following the yoga routine, there is an approximately 11-minute meditation for Arms & Shoulders (about 2 minutes of guided relaxation continuing with 8 minutes of nature sounds)  There are three Stressbusters on this DVD, each about a minute long: a brief introduction to Reflexology, the use of Aromatherapy, and information on Flying & Stress.  Overall, this Arms & Shoulders DVD offers the option of a gentle, short yoga workout addressing an area that becomes tight for many of us as a result of modern life.",1254009600,2,1511,5.101214574898785

3724991,5,B001NZ3E2C,"Yoga Emergency for arms & shoulders is awesome. I'm a competitive tennis player. As many athletes do, I tend to push myself and overdo it. Yoga Emergency is the fastest, easiest way i've found to loosen up my super stiff shoulder and stretch out my arms. Not only does it help relieve soreness after i've played, but Kristen's routine added some great new stretches to my stretching routine. I am going to buy Yoga Emergency Full Leg Stretch right now! Kristen rocks!",1234051200,2,467,4.7073170731707314
3724992,5,B001NZ3E2C,This DVD is a perfect mix of stretching and strengthening for your legs! The instructor has a peaceful voice and she clearly explains the yoga positions. The pace of the routine is good for me. I don't feel rushed or bored and my legs feel terrific afterwards.,1233964800,,260,4.553191489361702
3724993,5,B001NZ3E2C,"Usually yoga is a hard workout and even harder to stick with a routine. One of the great things about this series is the flexibility you get. The workouts are 12 minutes, and can be combined if you want a more in-depth routine, but if you are after a fast way to raise your metabolism and flexibility, then you only need 12 minutes at a time. The DVD also gives you different options for performing each difficult move, so for beginners like me, I can find a way to follow along without falling over :)
I have been using the whole set, and love it!",1233446400,4,548,4.228571428571429

8328468,5,B001NZ3E2C,"I bought this dvd because I was constantly getting tension headaches due to tightness in my neck and shoulders.  I tried pain relievers and thermacare and both only dulled the pain.  This dvd released the tension the very first time I tried it and it has not failed me since.  I no longer take anything for these headaches, I just do my 12 minute dvd and I am feeling great!  Anyone can do the moves in this dvd and you will feel fantastic.  I also like the full leg stretch dvd in this series.",1290470400,,494,4.212765957446808
8328469,4,B001NZ3E2C,"I love this routine.  I am not a practicer of yoga, but I am a runner, and this helps me avoid injuries.  I use it in combination with the Hips video in the Yoga Emergency series, and my body recovers so much faster after a long run.  Kristen Eykel has a soothing voice but not in a nutty, stuck-in-the-enlightened-world sort of way.  She is very flexible but teaches how to amend the stretches for those who are not.  12 minutes is a great length and in each of the videos I have, there is a one-minute strength segment that gets circulation flowing.  I also use these as a break from work (I work at home).  I took away half a star because of the corny music, which my husband and I both strongly dislike, and the fact that they are $10 a pop for 12 minutes.  I will, however, buy others because I like the two I have; I just think they are a little overpriced.",1268179200,,863,4.156626506024097

8328471,4,B001NZ3E2C,"Kundalini yoga instructor and wellness consultant Kristen Eykel offers this short yoga routine for Pregnancy, one of five DVDs in her 12-Minute Yoga Emergency Series. The Pregnancy yoga routine is 12.5 minutes long. Eykel is not pregnant (at least not visibly) while performing this practice. Although she does talk a little about how this practice can provide relief both during pregnancy and with labor and delivery, at no point does she mention whether any of the postures might need to be modified and/or avoided depending on your specific trimester.

Eykel begins the practice seated in easy pose for a dynamic move that involves stretching and releasing alternate arms for approximately one minute. After a stretch to either side, Eykel performs another more active pose, a seated spinal rock moving forward and back, again for about a minute. She then comes to a hands and knees position for an exercise that consists of rocking the knee in towards the chest, first on one side, then on the other. This is followed by a brief rest in child's pose (Eykel does suggest the option of using a pillow here if needed). Next, Eykel comes into a squat, holding this position for the optional practice of Kegels. Coming to standing, she does a bouncing move in and out of a half-squat position. The final move of this workout is performed for three full minutes: seated with arms out to the sides at shoulder level and thumbs up, you will make circles with your wrists. Eykel insists that if you can survive this exercise, you can survive a contraction! At the conclusion, Eykel ends the practice with a final ""sat nam.""  Following the yoga routine, there is an approximately 11-minute meditation for Pregnancy (about 2 minutes of guided relaxation continuing with 8 minutes of nature sounds).  There are two Stressbusters on this DVD, each about a minute long (these are not specific to pregnancy): 1) Journaling, using writing to both decrease tension and improve the immune system, and 2) Music & Relaxation, which recommends rhythmic chanting (of any type) to foster relaxation.

I should be clear that I am presenting this review as someone who is not (and has never been) pregnant. Despite this, I am fairly knowledgeable about yoga, and this practice is not what I would have expected from a routine targeted towards pregnant women.  In particular, it was quite dynamic, most likely related to Eykel's background in Kundalini yoga. Although this might be appropriate for an active mom-to-be and/or one who already is experienced with yoga asana, the workout which Eykel presents here might be a bit more intimidating to those who have never practiced yoga prior to their pregnancy.  Also, I believe that it would have been appropriate for Eykel to talk more about any potential contraindications to the poses. Still, some pregnant women are certainly likely to benefit from this short, convenient routine.",1254009600,3,2910,5.00206611570248
8328472,4,B001NZ3E2C,"Kundalini yoga instructor and wellness consultant Kristen Eykel offers this short yoga routine for Back, one of five DVDs in her 12-Minute Yoga Emergency Series. The Back practice (alternatively titled ""Mid & Low Back"") is 12 minutes long, the majority of which is performed on the floor. Eykel begins in easy pose with a seated spinal rock forward and back. She continues with spinal circles before moving onto hands and knees for both cat/cow and lateral spinal bends. Down dog is next, with Eykel adding a bent-knee stretch (a.k.a. ""crazy dog""); this is followed by a side stretch. Eykel then incorporates what appears to be a Kundalini yoga exercise, as it involves rolling up from a squat to a standing position several times. Standing, Eykel moves through hip circles, chest circles, and finally, an upright version of the spinal rock before concluding with ""sat nam.""

Following the yoga routine, there is an approximately 11-minute meditation for Back (about 2 minutes of guided relaxation continuing with 8 minutes of nature sounds) There are three Stressbusters on this DVD, each about a minute long: 1) Breathing, an overview of diaphragmatic breathing, 2) Gardening, extolling the benefits of gardening as a hobby, and 3) TV & Stress, which recommends avoiding TV at night in order to improve sleep.  Overall, this Back DVD offers the option of a short yoga workout addressing an area that can often become problematic for many. Eykel does not necessarily include the same yoga postures that are often seen in other yoga DVDs targeted to the back (e.g., reclined leg stretch); perhaps because of her Kundalini background, the routine that she presents here is a bit more dynamic, yet still generally accessible for most levels.",1254009600,2,1739,5.076923076923077
8328473,5,B001NZ3E2C,"Kundalini yoga instructor and wellness consultant Kristen Eykel offers this short yoga routine for a Full Leg Stretch, one of five DVDs in her 12-Minute Yoga Emergency Series. The Full Leg Stretch practice is 11 minutes long. The workout begins standing, with Eykel running through a series of poses all on one side of the body before repeating that same series on the other side. Although Eykel generally does not give names for the postures, she includes variations on pyramid pose, runner's lunge, kneeling lunge, kneeling hamstring stretch, and another pyramid variation to finish. Next is a move in which the influence of Eykel's Kundalini teaching seems apparent: she begins in a half squat and then comes to standing, continuing this dynamic pose for approximately one minute. Eykel concludes the practice with toe stretches, ankle circles, and a final ""sat nam.""

Following the yoga routine, there is an approximately 11-minute meditation for legs (about 2 minutes of guided relaxation continuing with 8 minutes of nature sounds) There are two Stressbusters on this DVD, each about a minute long: 1) Pets for Stress, and 2) White Noise, which focus on the background sounds of nature in particular.  Overall, this Full Leg Stretch DVD offers the option of a short yoga practice providing thorough stretches for the lower body. This routine is a bit more intense than the others in the Yoga Emergency series, and so it may be best-suited to those who already engage in physical exercise. It would make a great routine to add-on after running, weight-lifting, or another exercise session.",1254009600,2,1594,5.103448275862069
