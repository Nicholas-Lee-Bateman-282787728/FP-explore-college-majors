8482144,5,B00005YWK4,"This set gives you a very fast way to get started. Mr Steelman is a great teacher! Covers basic techniques you have to know. Material is applicable to classical piano, blues piano, rock and pop piano, and electronic music. Emphasis is on correct technique as applied to useful and common chords, arpeggios and chord progressions. A little bit of music theory, but the idea appears to be to start playing first and work your way into theory later. That is the fastest most practical way.  Carefully thought out as to what is presented, so the student learns the best and most practical things.
  Highly recommended for beginners.",1276128000,2,628,4.850467289719626
