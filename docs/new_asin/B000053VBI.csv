1392093,1,B000053VBI,"This is without doubt one of the worst movies ever made! Wooden acting,poor picture quality and a soundtrack that made my teeth grate.  Being a Poitier fan and language student, I got it for the foreign language subtitles.  A die hard movie buff might want to see it for the early wasted performances of some fine actors,including Raul Julia as a ""Hippy"".  I often disagree with the critics for lacking a sense of fun, but this turkey deserves all their venom.  If you decide to see it, I suggest you use earplugs and just read the subtitles.",982022400,8,542,4.556701030927835

1392129,5,B000053VBI,"This review is for the video version of the movie. I have yet to see it on DVD. But I will say this: It was so enjoyable seeing it on Showtime that I remember wishing the movie would never end.

The movie starts with a heist. But what makes it (The First Scene Of Movie) so unique is that there is almost no dialogue for the first opening 10 minutes of the film. A style rarely used in Hollywood (Although Brian DePalma Has Been Known To Use The Technique).

  SPOILER ALERT!!!

The group of youngsters who seek to take down the Organization (Mafia?) are a courageous and brave bunch. Unfortunately they are in over their heads. Drug dealers play for keeps, and they leave no live witnesses behind. The group of heisters are well-balanced and likeable (Save For Perhaps Joe) and one can only find oneself rooting for them. Had Joe not been found out they (The Group) might well have been able to hang onto the stolen skag indefinately.

When contacted by the group and asked for his help to undermine the Organization, Virgil Tibbs--against his better judgement--joins the revolutionaries in an effort to find out who is at the top of the Organization. Unfortunately things begin to unravel after Joe is beaten and later run over by the Mafia toughs attempting to recover the skag. From then on it goes downhill for the group as one of them is brutally murdured and another is shot down towards the end of the film.

I greatly liked this movie and I recommend it to those who enjoy a good mystery yarn. There are a few contrivances and even a few unanswered questions. Like did Dave Thomas survive the bullet wound? He was moaning when his camera was stolen from him, which would imply that he would have lived long enough to reach a hospital. What happened to the rest of the group? Did they stay together or split up? I for one would have loved to see where they were in the 1980s or 1990s. I so wish that Poitier had reprised the role two or three more times into the 1980s before handing it off to Howard Rollins. But alas, that was not to be. As John Wayne Peel (Of IMDB Post) said: ""It is a shame that Sidney Poitier did not again portray Virgil Tibbs, but we do have these three films, two of which are sensational. It is a privilege to add it to my detective movies on video collection."" I will do that too, Mr. Peel. However, I would also recommend to you these movies: Little Nikita, Shoot To Kill and The Jackal are three more movies with Poitier where he plays a Virgil Tibbs-kind of character. I've seen the latter two and can tell you I was very pleased.

This movie is a Four And a Half Star movie rounded up to Five Stars. It was close to perfect and set in one of the Five greatest American cities-- San Francisco!!

This, perhaps,  is the Poitier film that has aged least gracefully.

This film  seems standard TV cop fare of 1970's. It would be like a TV movie, if not for the star power of  Poitier. However if you are a fan of old cop shows,  this cast is filled with future TV cops..such as  Gerald S. O'Loughlin (The Rookies and Automan), Max Gail (Barney Miller), Bernie Hamilton (Starkey and Hutch), Ron O.Neal (The Equalizer and Superfly), Garry Walberg (Quincy ME) and Daniel J. Travanti (Hill Street Blues)

The plot wears thin after a half hour. Gil Melle's jazz score overwhelms the watcher long before them. It seem to make a point, you need to have a louder jazz score..it don't work for me!

It is the acting talent of Poitier that makes this film more than something you throw in a trash heap. His cool demeaner makes his character and this film still stand up. This film was Tibbs's film swan song and it acts like it...and please don't bring up the 1990's  TV version of ""In the Heat of the Night"", that charcter was so watered down for TV , it was BAD.

One would wish someone in Hollywood remake land would recreate Tibbs for the movies, I would enjoy Don Cheadle playing it...ah wishful thinking

7930421,2,B000053VBI,"Review of The Organization
Hot Toasty Rag, November 12, 2017

Of the films starring the immortal character Virgil Tibbs, The Organization is the third and final installment. Dont worry, though; Sidney Poitier made a lot of movies where he played an agent or a detective, so you can keep watching him save the day. Its not necessary, but youll probably want to watch In the Heat of the Night first, and depending on how much you liked it, They Call Me Mister Tibbs. In this one, Sidney is drawn into a radical group who want to expose and destroy the organization. It doesnt really feel like the first two films, though. It feels a little more like a mediocre detective movie with the normal amount of violence, law-breaking, explosions, and gun-waving.

Believe it or not, my main criticism with the film is one others might not even notice. When Barbara McNair asks her husband whats going on, since shes concerned for his safety after the violence and death threats in the beginning of the film, Sidneys response is to say, Honey, make me a sandwich, and wink at her. As handsome as he is, if I were his wife, I wouldnt have been happy at his answer. Shes married to a famous detective whos been featured in two other films, hes constantly the target of violent groups and criminals, and even if he weren't famous, hes chosen a dangerous profession. Its not unreasonable for her to worry, or for her to ask for more information! When Sidney blew her off, I lost a little respect for him and a little interest in the film as a whole.",1510444800,,1534,4.534296028880866
7930422,4,B000053VBI,"RELEASED IN 1971-72 and directed by Don Medford, ""The Organization"" features detective Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier) working in San Francisco where he encounters a noble radical group who want to take down a crime syndicate that deals in heroin. Barbara McNair plays Virgils wife while Raul Julia & Ron O'Neal play two of the vigilantes.

This was the third and final Virgil Tibbs movie, which happened to be the first detective movie series in color to go three films (or so they say). Between the first film, In the Heat of the Night (1967), and the second film, They Call Me Mr. Tibbs (1970), Tibbs transferred from Philadelphia to San Francisco and now had a family (he was single in the first film). This was perhaps done due to the success of Bullitt (1968) and the spectacular locations of San Francisco in general.

Speaking of the iconic Bullitt, The Organization is similar in tone, but more melodramatic, like Dirty Harry, which was released around the same time. While The Organization is the least of the three, its not far off and has its own points of interest. Theres an over-the-top funky score by Gil Melle, which certainly dates the movie, but it was avant-garde at the time (hip and happening). The scores to those other movies are dated too, of course, but they're not as overdone. Personally, I appreciate the music. Sheree North was 38 during shooting and plays a past-her-prime alcoholic babe, but she was still very jaw-dropping.

If youve seen In the Heat of the Night, its interesting to see Tibbs in his own stomping grounds, i.e. the multiculturalism of the big city, as opposed to be an understandably angry stranger in a small town of the still-prejudiced Deep South. As a snapshot of Big City, USA, 1970 (when it was filmed) The Organization is priceless. The climax is clumsily abrupt and ambiguous, yet it illustrates that Tibbs won the battle, but lost the war.

THE FILM RUNS 106 minutes and was shot in San Francisco. WRITER: James R. Webb.
