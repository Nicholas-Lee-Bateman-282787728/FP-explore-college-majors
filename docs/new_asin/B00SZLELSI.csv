8699985,4,B00SZLELSI,"This re-release of  Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell  from Studio: Kino Lorber that has a running time of Run Time: 108 minutes
appears to be an edited version of the movie compared to the Studio: Shock version  with a running time of Run Time: 122.00 minutes
which can be found at ASIN: B0019D8NLU . I included a picture of the cover so you can compare the results yourself. The Studio Shock is however a pal region dvd. It requires you to have a region free dvd player. I would prefer to have the entire movie Blu-Ray or not for my collection. I think 14 minutes of a movie cut out for a re-release version of the movie is to much being taken out of the film.",1519948800,,654,4.216

8699993,4,B00SZLELSI,"This comedy was Gina Lollobrigida's last film role as the star of the film.  After this delightful role in which she displayed the acrobatic ability of a comedienne instead of just the sexbombshell of the piece, she retired from the arena, only to appear sporadically in cameos here and there.  I believe she persued her great love of photography as she had by this time in her career as an actress, had stored enough money away so that she could in her early forties sit back and do what she pleased.  I believe this film was probably the best that she ever made and, perhaps, the best damned performance she had ever given.  The film was so well received that it has been done as a musical by the same name starring Georgia Brown back in the 70's and was the inspiration for Abba's musical, ""Mama, Mia"".  With the earthiness of an Italian comedy, the film also plays like a Feydeau bedroom farce halfway through, with the doors slamming and in this lover hustled off to receive this one before the other one is aware of that one's entrance.  And the lovers are played by such stalwarts of film as Phil Silvers, Telly Savales and, none other than playboy Peter Lawford.  Then there are the wives played by Shelly Winters, Lee Grant and, little known but very good, straight woman, Marian McCargo.  I love this film and have seen it many, many times and am surprised at the location filming, the vibrant colors and how well it plays over the years.  Here it is, 47 years ago, and it plays better than ""Mama, Mia"".",1431129600,5,1513,4.492700729927007
