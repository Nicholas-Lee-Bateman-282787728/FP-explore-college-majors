1410178,4,B000059ZVW,"The corn is as high as a movie star's eye in the yammer-yammer-yammer of Clifford Odets's Hollywood play THE BIG KNIFE, and Robert Aldrich's bristling film version can't do much to open up the talkfest.  But there's some fascinating stuff here.  For starters, the model for Jack Palance's cornered movie star is obviously John Garfield, but Odets seems to use the character as a mouthpiece for why he himself had failed to live up to his spectacular beginnings on Broadway.  The country of those who have sold out is familiar territory to Odets, and scattered in lots of very purple prose lie nuggets of sharply-observed writing.  The players know the terrain, too, and they tear into their roles with gusto.  Palance, Ida Lupino, and Miss Shelley Winters (what's with her billing here?) are all marvelous, and Rod Steiger is jawdroppingly good.  This is the 50's, remember, when George Stevens (held up here as a model of ""meaningful"" filmmaking) gave us the ultra-waspy Millie Perkins as Anne Frank, which makes Steiger's Jewish inflections and rhythms in an exceedingly unsympathetic role a risky, but very rewarding, choice.  (Hollywood had generally taken the guts and the ethnicity out of Odets, as per the very denatured film of GOLDEN BOY.)  When Steiger gets into gear, you can't take your eyes off him.  Special kudoes, too, to Jean Hagen.  Those who only remember her in SINGIN' IN THE RAIN are in for a shock.  Playing a drunken, masochistic adulteress, she manages to be simultaneously childlike, sexy, pathetic and chilling.  Good support from dependables like Ilka Chase, Wesley Addy, and Wendell Corey, too.  Really worth a look.",982800000,16,1645,5.025830258302583

1410184,3,B000059ZVW,"Hollywood has apparently always subscribed to the notion that there is no such thing as bad publicity and the film under review, The Big Knife, which derides the old time pre-1950s studio system and pokes into the seamy, steamy side of the business is a case in point.  That studio system, essentially a form of indentured servitude, meant that a actor signed to a studio was committed to that studio for the duration whatever other offers from other sources and offer to do non-studio material might come along. Needless to say the actors, especially the rising star actors, got short shrift under that arrangement and eventually that system was scraped but at the time period in the film it was in full sway.

The film based on a play by Clifford Odets (more on him later) portrays a very successful Hollywood actor Charlie Castle (Jack Palance) who is pushed this way and that by the powers that be in Hollywood under the old studio system. The powers that be, or rather the power that be, is one Sam Hoff (Rod Steiger) based on maybe seven different real Hollywood tyrannical bosses in the old days and who come hell or high water was intent on keeping the system intact. Charlie nevertheless tried to push back goaded by his wife, Marion  (Ida Lupino), who longs for Charlie to go back to his old idealistic self and stop making ugly films that only benefit the bottom line, Hoff's bottom line. The tension between Charlie and Hoff, between Charlie (a sometime philander as well as semi-idealist) and Marion, and between Charlie and his old time sense of himself that he still was a creative artist and not a hack drive the major action of the film. Of course as such uneven struggles go, the struggle between a weak semi-idealist artist and a profit- driven corporation who hold a career-threatening secret about the man can only end one way. Charlie in the end, Charlie Castle the man of clay, must take the fall, and he does.

So much for the rough plot-line of this melodrama, and whatever its pretensions that is the way the film plays out. What is more interesting is are the characters around the main characters. Apparently in putting this one together every possible stereotype was thrown in the pot from the pampered but proud leading actor to the loyal if distraught Hollywood wife and everything else in between. That in between includes that aforementioned raging studio boss, the yes-man flak man who will spin anything the boss tells him to spin, a groveling agent (Charlie's). a loyal friend, a disloyal friend's wife who is out strictly for kicks, kicks with whomever she eyes, a starlet who will do anything for success and a gentile writer who has had it with Hollywood and wants to go back to New York to write the great American novel ( a tip to Odets himself). That obvious mix along with plenty of over the top melodramatic moments at the end make this gentle-hard look at Hollywood's  insides less than it could have been.

A special word on Clifford Odets. There is plenty of talk in the film about lost idealists and idealism, about selling out the values of lost and hungry youth to the monster Hollywood. Odets when he wrote this thing could have used own checkered past as a guide-stone. Odets had no problem naming names of Communists that he knew before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) when they called him up. A snitch, no question. Others, remember the Hollywood Ten, told that committee to go to hell. So, yes, there is a certain sense in which this storyline is the storyline of Odets shabby little later life.

1410187,5,B000059ZVW,"I might have given this four stars but I think when people talk about the flaws of a film, there is an illusion that one could correct those flaws without fundamentally changing the film.  Yes, it is an adapted play and stays almost entirely on one set.  Rope is another example that comes to mind.  Like Hitchcock directing Rope, Aldrich makes all this work.  Aldrich could have tried to make it more cinematic but that would have wrenched the guts out of the film.  True,the performances are a little theatric but, like Rope, it is clearly not like a filmed play.  It is a film adapted from a play and made cinematic by how the camera subtlely moves around the set.

What makes it so worthwhile are the performances, which of course are also a tribute to the director, who balanced individual brilliance with a sensitively choreographed/orchestrated ensemble.  It is the most complex performance of Jack Palance that I have ever seen.  It makes me regret that he like too many others became type-cast.

There are moments that the script seems a little too slick but the overall flow of the story and the dialogue packs a wallop.  This is not a film to pass up.",1360108800,,1162,4.592233009708738

A famous journalist visits Charlie Castle to get the truth about his marital status. Marty was involved in a hit-and-run scandal years ago. Mrs. Castle walks down the stairway and tells Benedict to mind her own business. Can a gossip journalist ruin careers? [No mention of her corporate employer in all this. Can such news be used for a competitive advantage or manipulate stock prices?] The conversation tells about their life and personality. Will Charles sign that contract for seven years? Stanley Hoff is commercially successful, but not considered artistic. Charlie's wife advises him to turn the offer down. His agent Matt advises against giving too many checks to friends. Charlie doesn't like the pictures he is in. He plays tough guys. Matt tells Charlied the truth. ""Never underestimate a man you don't like.""

Stanley Hoff visits and they talk. What about the contract? [He plays the villain, but he talks business.] Charlie doesn't like signing for seven years. He is tired. Stanley reminds Charlie about their past and the scandal. He tells about a lesson from his past. A wife should help her husband. Stanley is in control. He wants an actor for his pictures. ""Please let me go."" But Charlie signs the contract. Are these just the temperamental actions from an actor? Charlie talks to Miriam; he lost. Later a woman visits him. He has been drinking. We learn about how a crime was covered up. [Are their lives that empty?] Miriam will see a lawyer. Charlie seems to have only business associates, not personal friends. Is Hollywood really like that?

They worry about Dixie Evans, who is talking too much. Can they shut her up? ""Removed?"" Dixie Evans talks as if she knew little about show business people. She talks about her past. Does she talk too much? Miriam shows up. There is drama and conflict in their conversation.

Rod Steiger is freakin scary! Lupino and Winters are very good. But for some reason this film just never comes together, and I think it is mostly that Jack Palance just doesn't have what it takes to carry the lead. But on the plus side, he is incredibly hot. Before his face went all wierd and gruesome, it was very handsome. And he had a big, hard, gym toned body in an era when most leading men never did anything more strenuous than lift a martini glass, and you really didn't want them to take their shirts off.

""The day you first scheme, you marry that scheme...and the scheme's children.""

That line is but one of many memorable moments in this over the top, stagey, yet very effective noir drama from '55. Palance does a fine job with Odets' occasionally campy dialogue, and every actor is at least decent, with Steiger winning the prize for Best OverActor. He really reminded me in voice and tone of early Brando here; not sure who was aping whom, though.

One major flaw in TBK is the complete absence of chemistry between Palance and Lupino; those kisses made it look like they would both rather eat poison. But there are so many crisp lines, so much intelligently worded vitriol towards Hollyweird from Odets, and such a sense of honesty here that the cheese melts on top of the burger and ends up making it that much tastier. (Odets' bitterness stemmed no doubt in part from his ratting out fellow writers in '49 to the HUAC...which perhaps he's trying to blame here on Jack Warner, who Steiger was supposedly channelling.)

The other great flaw here was shooting it all in one locale. This is a movie, not a play! Move that camera around...show us some of what made Hollywood so alluring that people would sell their souls to be there...use the studio's wealth to damn itself. But no, we just get that one house and one backyard, which may add to the gilded cage vibe but sorely holds the movie down in some ways.

Nonetheless, it's a uniquely dark view of the inner workings of the contract player days, and one of the best acerbic looks inward at Hollywood I've seen, as good as The Last Of Sheila but not quite as fine as The Player or Sunset Boulevard. It's always a rare and welcome glimpse any time the movie industry is willing to be somewhat honest about the entire enterprise of hypnotizing the masses. Hollywood has always been about bread and circuses on a huge scale, and they continue to misdirect our attention as our pockets are picked ever cleaner by the Boys Upstairs, yet I haven't seen a movie this harshly honest about the whole enterprise for many a year.

1410195,5,B000059ZVW,"Who ever thought that Jack Palance could ever deliver an emotionally wrought performance at this stage in his career? He does just that. He gives such a performance that it is just heartbreaking to watch him. Jack Palance had more range than he was ever given credit for having. This is a brutally well scripted realistic film directed by Robert Aldrich. Wendell Corey also gives a rationally based, cold and detached, but curiously humane performance driven by the system and in too deep for his own good but his conscience reminds him that he really should know better. Perhaps all the characters actually do know better and know that there truly is no way out.",1183939200,3,663,4.773913043478261
1410196,4,B000059ZVW,"There is very much room for debate on The Big Knife. The casting of Palance and Steiger, good 'ol whinny Winters, the stage-related lack of locales, etc., etc. Each of these can be parsed to illuminate why the film works or doesn't. In a way that's a sign of a good film, one that has made bold choices, and risks it's essential qualities.
I liked it. The thing that stood out for me though, was the seeming-multiple-endings. About three times I felt an ending, only to have another character enter, another scene. This may be Odets the writer, or Aldrich the director.
In any case I loved Palance. I am a fan of his, and in a lead, a somewhat straight lead, his casting is inspired. I felt he was emotionally resonant, quickly rising and falling with the clipped Odets' poetics. I watched it last night on TCM, and Robert Osborne remarked in the opening that this was a film about ""weird people, Hollywood types"" (paraphrase). I think that poorly sells the story, limiting it's scope and personality. Palance as Charlie Castle is a wreck because of his life in Hollywood, sure, but he isn't weird for it. His close relationships with his trainer/masseur and his publicist, among others, highlights his isolation and need for loving contact. Which makes Ida Lupino, as his possibly-leaving wife Marion, and her dilemma such a good parallel to Charlie's wanting to leave Hollywood.
And Rod Steiger....Over the top? Yes. But it a beautiful thing to watch. I love his commanding physical presence, his melodramatic crying, his hand-wringing. It may be scene-chewing and distracting to some, but again, it works within the story and the character. His psychological make up is so apparent, especially when he fears Castle will strike him, how he crosses his arms and tucks in.
Ida Lupino, who looks like she could be Stockard Channing's mother, was strong and poised despite her rancorous life, and I appreciated her for it. Her character was winning because of the strength she debated having to exert. Again, a Hollywood consequence.
Character actors, one and all, Smiley, Connie, Shelley Winter's wonkie Dixie, Hank (who could be Grey Davis' father), Nat (his slapping of Stanley Hoff's glass was awesome) , they all embody the inherent lack of stability in Hollywood.
The message is clear, and the execution (pardon the pun), was dramatic and interesting.",1181692800,3,2355,4.919597989949748
1410197,2,B000059ZVW,"I'm a great admirer of Clifford Odets, and I suspect ""The Big Knife"" worked very well on stage.  But as a movie, no way.  A film about Hollywood that confines itself to conversations in people's living rooms is not using the medium effectively.  I'll concede that some of those conversations are well-written, and the supporting cast (notably Ida Lupino and Wendell Corey)mostly excellent.  But beyond the staginess, the movie suffers from two monumentally bad casting choices.  Jack Palance is nowhere near credible as a romantic-type Hollywood leading man;  he's not comfortable even walking around (he shambles in an odd way). Palance is a character actor who played bad-guy parts memorably, but asking him to deliver ripe, soul-searching, theatrical monologues about integrity just doesn't work.  And then there's Rod Steiger as the nasty, amoral studio chief, who is so over the top, it's hard to describe.  Talk about scenery-chewing -- Steiger looks like he might literally rip up parts of the set and wolf them down at any moment.  It's such a ludicrous performance as to be almost weirdly watchable, but sinks any chance the movie had at dramatic credibility.  I can't understand why director Robert Aldrich allowed a non-A list actor (Steiger was just getting started on his great career at this point)to sabotage his film so thoroughly.",1181692800,2,1347,5.137614678899083

1410199,4,B000059ZVW,"""The Big Knife"" is based on the Clifford Odets play of the same name, adapted for the screen by James Poe and directed by Robert Aldrich. The film is not very cinematic. It is essentially a play that has been filmed.  It takes place almost exclusively on one set -a Bel Air living room, the dialogue is mannered, and the performances are often histrionic. This is Clifford Odets, and it's melodrama. The dialogue tends to purple but is certainly intriguing. It's not a natural adaptation of Odets, like 1952's ""Clash By Night"", which was transformed into a real work of cinema by director Fritz Lang. The actors sometimes deliver Odets' heavy dialogue naturally and casually; other times they go over the top. Moments of high drama are punctuated by drum rolls. Sometimes it seems that director Robert Aldrich should have interpreted the play more cinematically or more realistically for the silver screen, but I suppose that is a matter of taste. ""The Big Knife"" succeeds on the strength of its performances, which are almost universally excellent.

""Charlie Castle is a man who sold out his dreams, but he can't forget them."" Charlie (Jack Palance) is a movie star who made it big under contract to Hoff Federated studios, owned by unscrupulous megalomaniac Stanley Hoff (Rod Steiger). Charlie's wife Marion (Ida Lupino) has threatened to leave him should he renew his contract with Hoff. She can't stand the way that inane movies and virtual imprisonment have turned her once-idealistic husband into a spiritless toady. But Charlie isn't free to do as he pleases, because Hoff holds incriminating information over him. Charlie was in a drunken car accident, for which a friend and studio employee took the blame. And the only other witness to the accident, aspiring young actress Dixie Evans (Shelley Winters), has developed the habit of shooting her mouth off about it.

Most of ""The Big Knife"" is conversation, so we get to know these characters well. Jack Palance gives a powerhouse performance and is usually able to make the overwrought dialogue believable. Ida Lupino is striking as his wife as well. The tyrannical Stanley Hoff is forceful but over-the-top. He's so thoroughly evil and grand in his speech that he isn't very credible. He's played as if he were on stage, which I don't think was wise. That doesn't go unnoticed by the writers or characters, though. Charlie asks Stanley point blank if he's ever been told that ""the embroidery of your speech was completely out of proportion to anything you had to say!?""  That line made me laugh. Once you get past the histrionics, ""The Big Knife"" is a well-articulated, if theatrical, story of an idealist -Charlie, a man who sold out and never looked back -Hoff's assistant Smiley Coy, played perfectly by Wendell Corey, and a person who never met an ideal -Stanley Hoff. We get a fun, cynical take on the players of Hollywood's golden era as well.

The DVD (MGM 2002): This print of the film has not been restored.

After all, neither blackmail nor murder is off-limits to egomanical studio boss Stanley Hoff ( vintage Rod Steiger), while the human sharks swimming around him behave nothing like opening night at the Oscars. Maybe it's the sterling cast, featuring such 50's exotica as Steiger, Jack Palance, Wendell Corey, and Shelley Winters. In the end, of course, everyone gets to explode on screen except the ice cold Corey whose chronic bemusement proves ultimately more satanic than cynical. Whatever the reason, the result is an over-the-top cavalcade of unusual flair.
It's likely that producer-director Robert Aldrich targeted the film in behalf of blacklisted mentor Abraham Polonsky with whom he had collabrated on 1948's Force of Evil. After all, the year was 1955 and the all-powerful list could not be attacked directly, so what better vehicle than Clifford Odet's corrosive stage play adapted for all America to see. (Odets would do the same for Broadway in 1957's revealing Sweet Smell of Success.) It's fun to imagine how Aldrich's resulting indictment played in studio screening rooms where real reputations were at stake. Then too, much of the film's dirty laundry appears based on fact. The hit and run on Clark Gable's hushed-up 1933 episode; the Palance character on John Garfield's death at 39, listed officially as heart attack.
It's hard to picture the producers ever believing such curdled fare would actually make money. Of course it didn't, angering many ticket-buyers with a title that seemed to imply real action instead of endless palaver. Still, this overheated exercise in shameless baroque remains an interesting oddity. A permanent record not only of individual styles, but of artistic protest amidst the throes of cultural repression.",1013385600,12,2028,5.243076923076923
1410206,4,B000059ZVW,"For anyone like myself who has a fondness for the darker 1950s productions like Don Siegel's Invasion of the Body Snatchers or Alexander Mackendrick's Sweet Smell of Success or Elia Kazan's A Face in the Crowd, this movie--which might well have been called Faust in Bel Air--is an absolute must. Robert Aldrich was a perfect director for this kind of material, although The Big Knife--most of whose action takes place on a single set--is less kinetic than his earlier Kiss Me Deadly. Two great movies, Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard and George Cukor's A Star Is Born, had already wickedly dissected the less glamorous side of life in the movie industry, but The Big Knife not only presents a far gloomier view of Hollywood, but makes the backstage intrigues of the motion picture capital into a metaphor for the rampant political paranoia of Cold War era America. The movie is based on a 1949 play by Clifford Odets--who had himself named names to HUAC in order to continue working in the movies--about an actor being blackmailed by a Mephistophelean producer, but when Aldrich and James Poe transferred the drama into the context of the middle 1950s, no halfway knowledgeable viewer could have missed the analogy to the blacklist--particularly since the movie depicts the producer, brilliantly played by Rod Steiger, as a vicious reactionary in the mold of L.B. Mayer who worships General Douglas MacArthur. In addition, The Big Knife may also be seen as a reply to Kazan's On the Waterfront, which glorified an informer--and tacitly rationalized the director's own collaboration with HUAC--by showing its hero choosing to commit suicide rather than capitulate to the evil Steiger. As the other reviews note, the performances are all remarkable, but I was especially impressed by Shelley Winters as a would-be starlet. She only has one extended scene, but that alone is more than worth the price of the video, which is ridiculously low-priced.",983491200,28,1945,5.08125
1410207,5,B000059ZVW,"This film offers an amazingly dark and cynical look at the inner workings of Hollywood in the 1950's.  Jack Palance gives one of his best performances as a man whose charmed life as a sought-after movie star is torn apart by greed, jealousy and egotism.  For fans of snappy dialogue, this movie is a treasure-trove.  Jack to a friend on the phone: ""Go out!  Find a bar!  Sauce up!""  Shelly Winters:  ""If I have another drink I'm gonna see a snake!""  Studio Exec:  ""A woman with 6 martinis can ruin a city.""  Highly recommended for cinemasts who love movies about the movie biz.",982886400,4,577,4.514563106796117
7934678,5,B000059ZVW,"As I post this review (on 12/3017) I see almost 50 reviews posted under this listing. But, that is because Amazon has a weird policy of gathering ALL versions and formats of a film and putting them ALL under the most recent version. Hence you will see reviews gong back to 2001! (Yep, the VHS version). So I always recommend they people sort by the most RECENT first (not by stars) and look to see which version is being reviewed.
Yes, you can use older reviews for the plot and acting but thats it. This review is of the NEW Completely restored version of the film by the British Arrow Home Video imprint in their Classics series. (Distributed in the US by MVD Distributors).

Not only does this film look great, (new 2K restoration from the original elements) but there are HOURS (literally) of bonuses  some old, some new. The 111-minute film, which was written, looks and sounds GREAT. There is a full length commentary by  two film authorities  (Ive listened to part so far),  A 28 minute self-directed documentary by Saul Bass, on his title designs, and a rare TV promo from the1955. The film was based on the stage play by Clifford Odets and takes a real stab at the Leo B. Mayer and other Hollywood Moguls.  And  there is even a wonderful 4-page booklet with two detailed essays on the film and Odets in Hollywood.

I can hardly wait for the next restoration from Academy. Itll be the classic Jack Lemmon/ Shirley MacLaine film The Apartment.
I hope you found my review both informative and helpful.

7934679,3,B000059ZVW,"The Big Knife is a noirish melodrama based on a play by Clifford Odets. A look at the darker side of the Hollywood studio system, the movie features Jack Palance as Charles Castle, one of Hollywoods biggest stars. He seems to have it all. A former Broadway actor, he lives in opulence in Bel-Air, a suburb of Hollywood, but hes had to sell out his ideals to rise to the top. His marriage to Marion (Ida Lupino) is on thin ice and his wife is threatening to leave him if he signs a new seven-year contract. Studio boss Shriner Hoff (Rod Steiger) isn't taking the news too well, and hell do whatever it takes to get Castle to sign, even it means blackmail. Charles has sold his soul by succumbing to the pressures of men with power in exchange for wealth and fame. Now hes lost his way, and has turned to women and alcohol.

The Big Knife is a searing indictment of Hollywood, and no studio would make it. It was produced by independent United Artists and has a terrific cast, including Shelley Winters, Wendell Corey, and Jean Hagen.

The casting of Palance is odd. Lacking traditional leading man looks, he is hard to believe as a movie star in an era when looks were often valued over talent. His performance is excellent, but this is clearly casting against type.

Shelley Winters has some scene-stealing moments as Dixie Evans, a loud-mouthed actress who witnessed a tragedy involving Castle and could ruin his reputation, his popularity, and his earning power for the studio.

Few films portray so blatantly how actors during the days of the studio system were treated as cash cows first, human beings second. This film shows in unfiltered severity the shadowy machinations of the studios and the men who run them.

Bonus materials on the unrated Blu-ray release include Bass on Titles, a 1972 documentary in which Saul Bass, who designed the credit sequence in The Big Knife, discusses his classic work; critical commentary; rare television promo hosted by Jack Palance, Shelley Winters and others; theatrical trailer; and reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork.",1505520000,,2096,4.827298050139276

7934683,2,B000059ZVW,"Three or four times, all achingly overacted climactic moments, Jack Palance fiercely clutches estranged wide Ida Lupino for a fervent kiss.  If you look twice, however, you will notice that their lips never touch.  Palance's lips don't part or soften, and at the moment of contact, his face slides away, as if glancing toward his key light, or as if he changed his mind, suddenly preoccupied elsewhere.  Watching Mr. Palance's oddly compelling brand of chromosomal acting is like staring at a deadly reptile in a glass case.  You can't tear your eyes away.  It is also the kind of greedy fulsome performance that stops the story in its tracks, and swallows up Palance's fellow actors, who either stay out of his way (Ida Lupino, Wendell Corey) or opt to compete with stupefyingly bad star turns of their own (Steiger, Sloan, Winters) -- and director Robert Aldrich lets (encourages?) them get away with it.  The script itself seems desperate to keep up, the immensely gifted Odets at his most over-avid.  A slew of hackneyed stage-bound plot devices culminate in a gratuitous offstage suicide, straight out of (a parody of) Greek tragedy, with Ida Lupino left center stage in a grandiose aerial shot, held tilted upward, crying ""Help! Help!"" as a swooning soundtrack choir submerges all.  Help indeed.",1471996800,,1301,4.9907407407407405
