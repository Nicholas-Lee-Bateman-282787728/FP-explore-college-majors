8548192,4,B00A8GBV2W,"After being sacked as a project manager for a city banking firm, Kurt Wendell takes it all a bit too hard. He is also a bit of a martinet when it comes to being a daddy and he seems to go a bit `over the top' on his son and daughter. So after upsetting everyone he surprises them all by taking them out for a memorable day in the country.

Once they get to this isolated cottage he insists that the day is all about them; so he confiscates their mobile phones and starts playing happy families. Only he is fixing to make this his last day and he sees this planned project as his swan song.

This is from the psychological horror mode, not a slasher or splatter fest by any stretch of the imagination. Jonathan Hasler as Kurt is really rather impressive as the father who has lost it. He manages to be intimidating even when he is appearing to be nice. The story is original enough, but there are a few plot contrivances, continuity issues and also questionable developments that are only there to drive the story but can require a stretch of imagination. All in all not a bad effort at all and it did win Best Screenplay award at the Bram Stoker Film Festival, seven out of ten being rounded to four stars. The humour here is of the very dark kind too so don't expect any belly laughs, and all the side splitting is purely on screen.",1423267200,,1333,4.264822134387352
8548193,1,B00A8GBV2W,"I only had mild expectations for this movie but boy oh boy was it BAD!  If it was not the only thing I could watch on my iPad while my wife was driving, I would have shut off.  I love mindless low budget movies but this was horrible.",1377475200,,233,3.8333333333333335
8548194,3,B00A8GBV2W,An effective if mostly unpleasant British thriller about a man who loses it after being downsized from his job.  He brings his family out to the country for an impromptu holiday that's really an excuse to kill them off before committing suicide himself.  This is fairly intense and well-acted but not really much fun.  If you're on the mood for something a bit on the grim and sad side then this might be for you.,1366848000,,413,4.48
8548195,5,B00A8GBV2W,"Just when you think there is nothing new in horror, something comes along and grabs you. Axed is a separate breed of dark comedy, I call dark slasher comedy. This include scenes you find yourself laughing at, yet embarrassed that you do so.

Kurt ((Jonathan Hansler), a somewhat prudish man just got the ax at work. I like the small details Driscoll works into the scene. At a beautifully laid out breakfast table, Kurt picks up and looks at a burnt toaster waffle. Having just been fired at work, Kurt decides to have a surprise family day taking everyone into the country. As they pass school, Kurt informs them of his plans.

His daughter Megan says, ""This isn't funny.""

Dad replies, ""I wouldn't say that."" A little hint the writer tosses at us that this was meant to be a very dark comedy.

Dad has issues with his family. His son Jay (Christopher Rithin) isn't manly enough and gets bullied. His daughter Megan (Nicola Posener) isn't modest enough. His wife Steph (Andrea Gordon) has been having an affair with his boss Zack Peterson (Henry Douthwaite).

Kurt has a nasty little surprise for them all as he gathers them together .

Jonathan Hansler reminded me a bit of John Cleese in his role (what Brit doesn't). The ending dragged on a tad after a great beginning.

F-bomb, sex?, no nudity (Nicola Posener bra/cleavage) Clearly a film not for everyone.",1365811200,2,1361,4.69327731092437
8548196,1,B00A8GBV2W,"Two 5-star ratings for this POS?  Hard to believe, but to each his own.

Fangoria's ""Axed"" should have been given the axe before it was released into ANY kind of format.  The premise of the story is rather simple:  daddy has just been axed--get it?--axed--from his job, goes bonkers, and decides it's his family's fault.  Daddy then (in an EVER so convincing bit of acting...) tries to cover up his firing and decides to take the family on a little outing.  That's where the script falls completely apart and the viewer gets to see some really bad, community-theateresque attempts at acting.  The mother never acts like she's in one bit of danger, dad looks like he's just been hit in the head with a brick, the daughter is completely clueless, and the son--the son you just want to kick until he's dead.  Oh, and there's daddy's former boss tied to an upstairs bed, which daddy eventually stabs to death and then makes the rest of the family dispose of the body.  If only my family reunions would have been that much fun...

There isn't one redeeming aspect of this movie.  The acting is beyond awful, the script non-existent, and the ending left me doubled over with laughter.  I think the movie is rated R (for some blood and language).  Other than that, there is not much too it.  Absolutely awful.",1365379200,,1302,4.604347826086957
8548197,2,B00A8GBV2W,I rented this after watching another Fangoria sponsored release Human Resources. I give this a little less than middle of the road review. It was mildly interesting but I just wasn't as riveted to the film as Human Resources. I am not interested in purchasing this at all. A British release with fair acting just not a unique story.,1364342400,,332,4.6440677966101696
8548198,5,B00A8GBV2W,"One of the first in the new 'Fangoria Presents' line up, this small suspense horror-thriller is tense, topical, and way better than expected.  The cover is in comic book style and yes, this film certainly has that kind of 'Creepshow' over-the-top black-comedy feel to it.

Disturbing and creepy, Jonathan Hansler plays the father who has lost his job and now lost his mind with sinister relish.  The film starts with a demented breakdown and there is barely a dull moment after that as his playful games soon turn into a bloodlust rampage.  You never know where the story is going, or who will survive, if anyone, and it is great to see a genre movie that is not totally predictable.  Plenty of tension and a few jumpy shocks will keep you hooked.

Not a game changer but good solid entertainment and a good sign of things to come from Fangoria, a respected name in horror.  So turn the sound up and the lights down and enjoy!",1363564800,,926,4.542168674698795
