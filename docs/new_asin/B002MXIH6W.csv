8626261,1,B002MXIH6W,"I'm all for independently-produced films and video, and totally willing to go with bad sets, costumes, and special effects... but that's not a problem with Starhyke.  It's the writing.  It's incoherent.  It's not characters moving through a story, it's actors trying to ham up the scene enough to make it funny, before moving on to the next fart joke.  I can't believe it actually made it all the way to DVD without an adult to say it should never have been published at all.  It's not even campy trash - it's just not worth your time.",1334966400,3,535,4.53125
