8129457,4,B000G8P1NW,"Collectors have long since learned to be wary of the DVD compilations offered by discount houses - there are plenty of unwatchably murky video transfers out there which aren't worth buying, even at bargain basement prices.  And Alpha Video (Alpha Home Entertainment) hardly has a stellar record in this respect.  But when they get it right, they deserve to be recognized for it!  Volume 3 of their Golden Age Theater series has four episodes from a selection of fifties anthology shows (SINGER FOUR STAR PLAYHOUSE, TV READER'S DIGEST, and TELEPHONE TIME).  And all of them are decently clear and reasonably crisp transfers from good quality source material.  Hey, I'm as surprised as you are!  Episodes featured:

The Adolescent - Campus counselor Ida Lupino has to investigate a student's troubled private life.  With Hugh Beaumont.

The Brainwashing of John Hayes - A Protestant missionary in Communist China is subjected to a show trial.  Pretty dreary cold-war-fare, but a good character study by lead Vincent Price.

A Place of His Own - Shellshocked vet Charles Boyer has to submit to the guardianship of imperious sister-in-law Jeanette Nolan.  With its offbeat premise and a few suspenseful touches, this entry stands out a bit from the other (pretty routine) episodes.  And it ends with a wry Hitchcock-ian twist: no surprise, since writers John and Gwen Bagni also did scripts for Hitchcock's own show.

The Golden Junkman - He built a fortune from nothing; now hardworking immigrant Lon Chaney, Jr. has to teach his privileged sons about humility and character.",1206403200,9,1572,5.113725490196078
