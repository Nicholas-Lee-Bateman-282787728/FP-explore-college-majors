8052493,2,B0007VY4YU,"Seriously?!?! What is this crap?

I'm on a ""can't watch TV shows"" mood, so I got all the prime pay cable channels, Amazon Prime, Dekko, HereTv, Hulu & had netflix, & have been watching any & all gay flicks (prefer the happy, sappy ones) & I took a chance on this. Talk @ time, I'll never get back. All, but 2 were absolutely horrible. The only 2 that were ok and of course the shortest: the movie theater ""coke & popcorn"" & ""coffee date"". Seriously, I can't believe this is floating around as ""watchable"". I'll give it 2 stars because I liked 2.",1510185600,,545,4.29126213592233

8052497,2,B0007VY4YU,"This is a very poorly constructed collection of Gay Men's Shorts.

Two of the shorts; Popcorn & Coke and Uninhibited had the feels of interstitials that might have been shown among the trailers at a film festival.

The DVD jacket promises a short called My Straight Boyfriend that's NOT actually included in the disk.

Also the short listed as Truth or Consequences on the DVD cover is actually Truth or Dare on the disk. Its darkly lit and very grainy.

Overall I'm NOT impressed with this collection.",1268265600,4,502,4.735632183908046
8052498,2,B0007VY4YU,"The title is more eye-opening than the work.  Here are short works from around the world featuring men who are ambivalent about being gay, loving up other dudes, or being a part of a supposed gay community.  The Boys' Shorts series is much better than this.  This features international short, but their are gay foreign films better than this.  For example, Spain's ""Bear Cub"" was far superior to the Spanish offering here.  Maybe these works are a challenge to essentialism.  Nevertheless, you may be severely disappointed after watching these works.",1125446400,9,551,5.066666666666666
