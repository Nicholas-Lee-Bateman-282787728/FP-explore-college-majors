I followed the production of this film pretty much from the start, and this, much like Clerks or El Mariachi was a true independent effort. And because of that, because of the final result, I believe this film deserves all of its 4 stars.

The script is sufficient, the acting is sufficient, the editing is above par as are the make-up effects and score.

For any budding indie creator or just for anyone who enjoys the genre, this is a great flick well worth the price.",1351555200,,658,4.6068376068376065
8474685,5,B005IGVTLK,"Seriously, this is a great film if you look at the entire picture. Unlike some folks who go to see a film for pure entertainment alone, I tend to look into every nuance of the film. It is however ""entertaining"" as some may say. This film brings back some nostalgic greatness!!! Do yourself a favor and read up on the director, then give the film a watch. This guy does what many never had the balls to do. He followed his dream, and I respect that just as much as I respect this film.",1347321600,,484,4.159574468085107

8474687,4,B005IGVTLK,"My friend suggested I check out this movie as I'm a long time fan of horror/genre movies from the 70's and 80's.  Got the gang together for a Friday night viewing and we had a blast!  Sure it's got a bit of a home grown charm to it -- this is no big budget studio flick -- but the performances are solid and it features some kick ass make-up/effects.  Looking online I learned it was all done on a super low budget, something like a student film project that the director made into a feature film.  Of course much of the visual effects, make-up, practical effects, he had to do himself.  Now that's what they call the independent film spirit! Very impressive!",1322524800,3,659,4.368852459016393

He has done several short films that are incredible!! He is now editing a web series titled ""Bite Me"", check it out...",1322265600,,268,4.911111111111111
