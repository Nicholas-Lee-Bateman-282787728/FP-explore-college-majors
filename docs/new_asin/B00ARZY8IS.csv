5495337,4,B00ARZY8IS,Nice selection of disaster movies. The switch up of selections of fairly recent movies I thought would keep somebody entertained. Don't try to read into them as they are for entertainment not for scientific exactness. I would like to think this is a set that periodically want from time to time watch one of the movies over again.,1395014400,2,330,4.706896551724138
5495338,3,B00ARZY8IS,"None of these are big budget films with name stars or strikingly original plots; they are programmers, secondary or so-called B pictures. Yet, for such a collection, the movies are of relatively high quality. I should say that the average film in the collection is  equal to the average quality of the 'made for  television movies'. Some, like Miami Magna, are available as singles only at a prohibitive cost (ca 30 dollars). These make excellent ""last thing before sleep"" or ""after the main feature"" movies, something you watch when sleep, fatigue or unraveling is called for. I particularly liked Firestorm: 72 Hours in Oakland, which had the usual assortment of family stories in the face of crisis, but simply done and well performed.",1375056000,3,738,4.991869918699187
8557286,5,B00ARZY8IS,"very good group of films...some better than others, but that's a matter of taste, of course.  worth the price of admission to forget all the nonsense in the world with some old-fashioned nonsense.  enjoy.",1528416000,,204,4.970588235294118

8557294,4,B00ARZY8IS,"I thought that you M-I-G-H-T be interested in knowing that you can get all of these movies, seperately, at a much
higher [total] collective price... e=x=c=e=p=t for ""FIRESTORM: 72 HOURS IN OAKLAND"", and----MY favorite of the
lot----""DEATH FLIGHT"", the, 25 FEB 1977, abc-circle, made-for-TV, Friday Night Movie.... also known as ""SST:
DEATH FLIGHT"" and, AKA, ""SST: DISASTER IN THE SKY"".
After research, I discovered THIS version is actually four minutes longer than any source searched, and, has some-
thing you'd've
N==E==V==E==R
seen on network TV----when all we had was CBC, NBC, and ABC---- pretty woman you've HEARD of, naked: Misty Rowe.
The Bert Convey scene (with Ms Misty Rowe) was typical of a ""European Version"" of an American movie spruced up
for those of us on the OTHER side of The Atlantic.
Go figure. I live in Germany where there's no problem showing nudity on TV, but they'll edit out violence because
BLOOD is a four-letter-word!
No one butt Misty is naked. You'll recognize a lot of the familiar faces in the cast. It has ""Q"" from Star Trek: NG;
Ginger from Gilligan's Island...with minimal makeup; both leads from ROUTE 66; The Brady Bunch's dad; and Pa
Cartwright. Starting with people I've already referenced:
Misty Rowe...and her frontal delights.

Now, to get people younger than myself back into the loop...
SST= denotes the [French] Super-Sonic Transport, a plane that flew to France from NYC in just a couple hours.
They haven't flown in, what?, 14 years?
The SFX is what you call matte-paintings... and a model airplane hanging from a string in front of airplane flight file-footage.
By far, the fastest-moving 1.5-hour movie in the bunch. Worth the purchase price... and another 5 movies as a bonus.

Please remember that I saw this ""full screen"" movie-of-the-week on the center 45-inches of my 55"" TV, and en-
joyed every ""cheesy"" minute of it. Last time I saw this pristine print, it was shorter... and on a 21"" glass
picture tube. Yahoo! Er, HEE HAW!
Thank you for your time; Enjoy!

8557295,5,B00ARZY8IS,"I have been waiting for this release for ages. I have been hoping Firestorm: 72 Hours In Oakland would be released on dvd and it finally has, with great picture quality.  I have not watched the other movies yet, but hopefully they are as good as Firestorm.  Now if only someone would release an official dvd of Fire And Rain.",1400284800,2,325,4.4
