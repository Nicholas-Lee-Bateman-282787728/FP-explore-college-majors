8002073,4,B0000E6XKB,"One should not use ""real"" as an intensifier, but despite that I decided to try one of these ""Real Wild Girls"" DVDs. I've seen a bunch of these DVDs of girls flashing at Mardi Gras and elsewhere, and while this is not necessarily the best I've seen, it's quite a good one. It's a single DVD that runs about 60 minutes, with no extras (so I don't know why it's labeled a ""2-pack"") . This DVD is unusual in that it does not just focus on the flashing as most do, but also shows other scenes indoors and out - some funny incidents, audience reactions, host comments, and so on, giving you a better sense of the overall activities at a Mardi Gras. Yet there's not so much of these ""distractions"" that you get annoyed, since the producers keep in mind what we're all looking for when we buy DVDs like this. It usually has good picture quality, and has quite good camerawork and editing, though I would have cut a few shots. Also, it's less silly than some similar DVDs I've watched. And most important, there are plenty of sexy babes on here!!",1207353600,,1037,4.350515463917525
