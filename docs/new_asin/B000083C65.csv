8549962,4,B000083C65,"Play'd is a story about two friends in a rap duo who become rivals after one decides to sign a solo deal with a shady record company owner. The movie is loosely based on the East Coast - West Coast rivalries that resulted in the death of 2Pac Shakur and The Notorious BIG. The movie has its corny moments but its definitely worth it, considering you get to see the late great Merlin Santana in one of his final performances. Actor Rashaan Nall who plays ""Jaxx"" was good as well and served as great eye candy being that he is incredibly sexy. I give this movie 4 stars.",1041120000,2,568,4.268518518518518
