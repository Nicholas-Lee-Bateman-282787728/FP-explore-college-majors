5088880,2,B007I8KXDQ,"I know it is cliche to say that a book was beter that a movie version, but I am going to say it really applies here.  Many may not even know that this movie was originally based on a book titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shrinking-Violet/dp/1416596968/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shrinking Violet</a>.  In fact that is probably a good thing, since the movie is so vastly different from the book that it is almost impossible to connect the two.  While both stories focus on a young girl in high school who is painfully shy but becomes a radio DJ that gains popularity and ultimately has to get over her shyness to reveal her identity to her school.  In the book however, not only does the main charachter have a different name, but almost every plot point is different.  In the book she doesnt do her own internet radio broadcast but has to work up her courage to actually ask her step-father to let her help out at his radio station, then work her way up to a job on the air.  In the book you get more of an idea WHY she is so shy, what she has had to deal with in her life that make her the person she is, and you get to see the changes and choices she makes to grow to the person she becomes at the end.  If I hadnt read the book and loved it first, i would probably have written the movie off as forgetable and never think twice about it.  If i were to rate the movie on its own merits i would say that it is not worth the price to buy, or rent, and if you like teen movies to maybe watch it on TV.",1343692800,4,1549,4.335640138408304

5088882,5,B007I8KXDQ,"This is a film for big fans of Debby Ryan.  She has the main part in the film so you'll be seeing a lot of her.  I love how her character is so shy and can only talk to a few people, but then she goes on the radio as Radio Rebel and it's as if she becomes another person.  I think she does a fantabulistcal job.  Sarena Parmer as Audrey did a wonderful job.  Seeing Atticus Dean Mitchel as Gabe was a lot different than the role he did in My babysitter's a vampire.  I thought he played the role well, but it showed what happens when you think more of yourself and less about other people.",1341532800,,589,3.9491525423728815
5088883,5,B007I8KXDQ,"I have been on this Disney FIOS thing the past few weeks.  I decided to record this movie.  I really liked it.  It reminded me of one of those teen/family movies from the 80s or early 90s.  If was fun and heart felt.  Good for the entire family!!!!  I still have not deleted it.  I am waiting for my mom to watch.  Now I can just buy the DVD.

The movie is about a girl who finds a way to talk even though she is shy.  Then something happens that may require her to let everyone know who she is!  Will she get over her fear and just let people know who she is, or will she continue letting out her emotions while staying hidden?  You will have to watch to see.  I'm a 27 year old guy and I really liked the movie.  Give it a chance.",1338076800,6,732,3.858108108108108
5088884,3,B007I8KXDQ,"I thought it was OK obviously. Ryan's character a;most seems dumb in her shyness. Her mouth is always hanging open like ""der"". I liked the friendships for the most part, tho.

5088890,5,B007I8KXDQ,"This was one of my really favorite coming of age movies.  Complex, developed characters, good acting and dialog, an excellent story that could actually happen, This is, again, about how appearances can be deceiving and be careful who you shun, they might be most interesting!  Even authorities can be too bull-headed to recognize free speech and expression rights, trying to pressure someone into doing what you want by punishing the innocent -  a common theme - doesn't work well and may backfire.  I enjoyed this movie very well.  I rented it to watch and then, after seeing it bought it so it can't just disappear some day.  I recommend it.",1435104000,2,643,4.8

5088920,4,B007I8KXDQ,"After reading the book that was the inspiration for Radio Rebel, I couldn't help but check the movie out. I was initially a bit skeptical; I thought it might be overly immature and cheesy since it was made by the Disney Channel... but I was actually pleasantly surprised by what the movie held.

This is a squeaky clean flick (thank you, Disney!); I can't remember even a trace of innuendo or bad language. It would be completely safe for any member of the family to watch. It's set in high school and most of the characters are school age, so occasionally it does have a slightly ""young"" feel, but not extremely so. I thought the characters were cast pretty well, especially Tara.

There's a nice amount of comedy, and while some might consider it cheesy-comedy, I couldn't help but laugh at the antics. Is it completely realistic? No... but I found it entertaining anyway. It's a very ""up"" feeling film, with an overall happy-go-lucky vibe.

I admit the book and movie are wildly different, but both have their own merits. If you're familiar with the book, I advise trying to view the movie as a completely separate piece of work...while the stories do loosely parallel each other(somewhat), hardly anything is completely the same, aside from the radio station name--SLAM FM. If you're willing to set aside the book and look at the film as a separate piece of work, I think you'll find it fairly entertaining. :)",1369785600,8,1414,4.716599190283401

8517418,4,B007I8KXDQ,"Yes the movie plot isn't an original concept, the 1990 movie Pump Up the Volume with Christian Slater was about the same thing, a shy, pretty much invisible to the other students kid who had a hidden identity as a cool radio personality on a pirate radio station every kid in the school was listening to.  But that was more like a regular movie, whereas Radio Rebel is done more in the style of your Saturday morning school set TV shows, the sets all look really clean and sterile, there's no bad language, everything from the shyness of the main character, the no real reason but school principal wants the rebel student who has really has nothing to do with the school exposed and expelled, kids can tell a janitor to wait outside his supply closet because they want to have a private conversation, to the power of the school bully mean girl type is exaggerated. It's like watching a 90 minute episode of a 2000 decade or this one's Disney or Nickelodeon channel TV show.  So if you don't mind that, or that's even what you were after, then you won't go wrong with Radio Rebel.

The movie is entertaining, the characters likable, the mean girl doesn't do anything majorly bad, but enough that you want her to get her comeuppance. Tara is a bit too different when at school or even at home without the headphones on to when she's Radio Rebel to be plausible. In fact as the shy teen she doesn't speak much but mumbles something when made to, shuffles along when she walks, has her hair over her face like a homeless woman living on the street and looks down at the ground all the time.  Obviously in real life both her mother and the school would have failed in their obligations if she is still like this in her final year of high school and should have got her some sort of professional help to at least be able to write on a whiteboard and hold a conversation. But that's what these Saturday morning teen aimed shows do. And yet when she's Radio Rebel her hair looks normal and she has no issues, she's like a normal kid (or Hollywood TV show kid).

The story goes through the predictable stages and at the end is what you knew would happen before you even started watching it.  But the characters are fun, even the mean girl bully, and it's a pleasant journey there and way to pass 90 minutes or your time.  Radio Rebel (the character) does have some pretty good messages for those who may be feeling a bit like Tara throughout the movie too.",1520121600,,2447,4.412416851441241
