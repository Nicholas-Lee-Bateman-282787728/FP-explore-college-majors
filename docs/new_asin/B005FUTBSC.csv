4685774,2,B005FUTBSC,"First and foremost, this is a monster movie.  This is nothing like the subtle and only briefly creepy flop, The Mothman Prophecies, but more like Friday the 13th.  I won't knock it for that, but if you're here deciding if you should watch it, keep that fact in mind.  Maybe you already knew this.  I did not, and so I am making a point of it.

The movie is about a bunch of dumb teenagers, played by people who do not look like teenagers, that accidentally kill a boy and cover it up.  10 years later, the heroine journalist (Jewel Staite) returns to do write an article that she spends almost no time writing.  Instead, she triggers the wrath of a vengeful native American spirit (are there any others in Hollywood?) that ends up killing 60% of the named characters. Then there's a stupid twist at the end.  If you watch horror movies, there will be nothing new here.  In fact, I could just copy and paste any review from just about any other bad horror movie and the same points would apply.  Cardboard characters, a story strung together from old cliches, generally spotty acting, poorly paced, yadda yadda yadda.  Despite being a horror movie, it's not at all scary.  It doesn't make you nervous to be in the dark.  It doesn't make you look over your shoulder every few minutes.  It doesn't make you hear whispers in silence.  It's not even very fun, it's just boring, eye-rolling crap.

It's worth my time to congratulate the cast and crew who were on the set filming.  While most of the acting wasn't what I would call 'good', it was much better than it could have been - nobody just flatly read their lines, for instance.  The same goes for the camera work, the special effects and the audio.  It may not be art, but it was professionally done and it says a lot about a person who can suck it up and work through the crap.  This is especially true of Jewel Staite, who always acts with the natural grace to make anything believable.  She doesn't just say lines, she really delivers them, and she made even her wafer-thin character enjoyable to watch.  I miss seeing her with a real character that she could make shine on screen, like Kaylee on Firefly.  Honorable mention should go to Jerry Leggio who played an animated ""Old Man"" archetype in Frank.

All of that said, two good actors can't be expected to hold up a whole movie and when the rest is just ""not bad"", you don't have something that's really worth your time.  Two stars, one as a high five for professionalism and another for Jewel Staite.",1319932800,7,2509,4.473568281938326

4685776,1,B005FUTBSC,"Mothman (Sheldon Wilson, 2010)
[note: review originally published 10Jul2010]

If you had told me eight years ago that someone would make a mothman film worse than The Mothman Prophecies, I probably would have laughed in your face. If you had come beck to me five years later after the releases of Shallow Ground and Kaw and told me that that worse mothman movie would be directed by Sheldon Wilson, I would definitely have laughed in your face. On the other hand, had you told me that someone was making an awful mothman movie and it starred a veteran of the works of the most overrated producer on television, Joss Whedon, I would have said, ""yeah, I can see that."" So how did Sheldon Wilson, whose career seemed to have such unlimited potential, get roped into directing this Jewel Staite vehicle that's so bad it went straight to the Sci-Fi Channel? Lord knows. And I'll warn you now, you may find yourself tempted to be seduced by the few things about this movie that are actually decent for the first forty-five minutes or so. Do not listen to your baser instincts, for when you get to the ""how the mothman came to be"" flashback, you will rue the day you ever decided to rent this dog.

In any case, the plot: a group of friends are horsing around in the woods, and one ends up dead. The others make a pact to cover it up. Fast forward ten years, and Katharine (Staite, from Firefly and Stargate Atlantis), the only one of the group to leave town, is now a reporter. Her editor is sending her back in order to do a story on the Mothman Festival. (The mothman festival does really exist, though Amazon does not allow outside links, so I can't show you--google it.) She comes back and no one, with the exception of old boyfriend Derek (The Six Wives of Henry Lefay's Connor Fox), is all too happy to see her. In any case, now the group are all back together, and the mothman pops up and starts offing them.

You know, if Sonny Lee and Patrick Walsh (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) had made this a straight murder mystery, with one of the group or Jaime's demented brother or something going around killing them out of revenge, it might have made a half-decent, if forgettable, slasher movie. But no. We see ol' mothy himself pretty early on. And it probably could have still been a half-decent slasher film, if you ignore the fact that, true or not, the Mothman is the silliest legendary creature in recorded history (couldn't they have gone with the yeti or something? Really?). But man, they couldn't even get that right. Everything about this script is derivative, right down to the way mothy gets from whatever abyss he lives in to our world. (Seriously, I've seen it in at least three horror flicks in the past five years.) The acting is mostly laughable (you expected anything else from anyone who came out of a Joss Whedon series?), but in a way that befits the silliness of the script. And the special effects... the less said about them, the better.

The only decent thing I can say about the movie is that it's not entirely unwatchable. Which is better than some movies I've seen recently. But it's definitely not one you want to go out of your way to see. If you catch it on TV late night while battling insomnia, it may be a worthwhile remedy. *",1355270400,,3264,4.499156829679595
4685777,1,B005FUTBSC,"I'll start by saying that I did enjoy THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES with Richard Gere and directed by Mark Pellington.  It was stylish, creepy, had good performances, and somehow managed to make a semi-coherent story out of the weird, backwater legend of the Mothman from West Virginia.

This film, MOTHMAN, is a weird mix of the supernatural myth and lazy storytelling.

It opens with a scene that you only see in movies.  A group of teens plays in a river when an annoying little brother drowns.  The teens laugh that it's the Mothman pulling them down as they jerk each other under the water.  But the little brother is spotted floating face up and dead nearby.  Now comes the scene you only see in movies: all of the teens decide that they'll lie that the little brother hit his head on a rock and drowned...and THEY EACH TAKE TURNS HITTING THE DEAD BODY IN THE HEAD WITH A ROCK.  Now maybe Point Pleasant, West Virgina doesn't have the resources to go all CSI on this case, but this kid's head had to be pretty battered after a dozen teens takes turns slamming a stone down on him.

The rest of the film is weird contortions to the monster movie formula as they try to shoe-horn details about the Mothman legend into the script.

You never really know what's going on or what the characters can do to protect themselves as the story stumbles along.  Each new thing they try to avoid being killed by the Mothman doesn't seem to work.  The CGI is lame and unrealistic.  The characters bland and interchangable.

It is what is says it is: ""A Sy Fy Original.""",1350259200,,1553,4.480427046263345
4685778,3,B005FUTBSC,"Horror fans gotta love the SyFy channel...what major studio would claim movies like MOTHMAN?  This time the Mothman legend becomes a tale of retribution and justice on a group of friends who are targeted for a crime they covered up 10 years earlier and meet horrible deaths at Mothman's claws.
It's all mindlessly hokey fun with the expected cheesy monster effects and pedestrian acting.
Recommended mainly to those of us addicted to the SyFy Channel!!",1344729600,3,452,5.026666666666666
4685779,2,B005FUTBSC,"The budget couldn't have been THAT bad. But the brutal CGI and bad acting sure didn't help the semi-cruddy writing & plot.

Given that this seems to be a SyFy original movie its not as bad as some of the other crap I've seen by them. But had I known it was theirs I honestly wouldn't have bothered renting it. Their movies are a joke. But, if you like their stuff, have at it. I've seen a LOT worse in general, thus the reason this gets 2 stars instead of 1.

4685780,4,B005FUTBSC,"A strange morality lesson: first, how to dispose of a pesky little brother, and second, the consequences thereof (albeit a decade late in coming, proving that you can almost get away with murder).
""Just for fun,"" a group of teens drown a boy then cover it up by bashing him in the head 7 times (the `story' that they all stuck with was that this poor boy must have dove into the water and hit his head on a rock.....7 times!).  That the local cops bought this theory is a testament to their brilliant powers of deduction.  Although it is difficult to believe that they readily accepted that this boy kept jumping into the water, hitting his head on the same rock, until it finally did the trick!?
A bizarre premise in any alternate universe, but that's what we're expected to believe so that the story could move forward 10 years (with these same 7 ""kids"" looking not a minute older).
Trouble begins when one of the reluctant murderers (Jewel Staite) returns to the scene of the crime, her hometown.  At that point, MOTHMAN finally seeks his revenge, like some crime fighting do-gooder trying to rectify injustice by killing the perpetrators of this heinous crime.  Some of his methods are rather imaginative, like death by Airstream (the moral being, don't stand too close to your trailer).  After that, they're taken out higgledy-piggledy in an inconsistent but tasteful fashion.

I'm ashamed to admit I thought it was a hoot, I like it.  I even liked the `cartoon' looking MOTHMAN.  My only complaint has to do with the jacket cover on the DVD....what is it, because nothing like it appeared in this movie.",1322697600,,1609,4.701067615658363

4685782,2,B005FUTBSC,"I remember seeing this when it was called I Know what you did last summer, or something similar.  It is an old and tired formula.  College pals accidentally kill a younger brother and do not want to go to jail, so they make it look like he hit his head and drowned.  Much later, they return to their hometown and start being attacked by a creature celebrated there and called Mothman.  Yawn.  You can guess the rest.",1320278400,,416,4.35064935064935
4685783,1,B005FUTBSC,"I agree with the other one star. There's a reason you suddenly find movies you've barely or hardly heard of showing up in Redbox - because most everyone found out, with information gleaned from independent sources, that nobody wanted to watch the movies in the first place. Redbox probably has to pay about thirty five cents for rental rights which is about the value of this movie and of course the rest is operating cost and profit.

Anyway, pointless goes nowhere plot of the usual group reunion brings to life the cheap CGI, that any high school graphics class could create in a week, Ghostface face (from Scream) coming through mirrors to kill in the usual, cheap keep the production cost low, cartoonish way. You don't really see the kill just some smeared paint later. Anyway, Mothman CGI gets toasted at the end like burning CGI tissue paper - about 5 seconds. Lots of FF will end the boredom.",1320105600,3,901,4.666666666666667
4685784,1,B005FUTBSC,"And that is saying something.  I grew up a fan of MST3K and have actually sat through a couple of Ed Wood productions.

We only made it through the first 23 minutes of the film, but please believe me, it was MORE than enough for a heaping helping of derision.

I actually reserved this on Redbox because it kept being rented and I enjoyed The Mothman Prophecies so much I really hoped they would have a good sequel here.

My hopes were mercilessly dashed right from the opening scene, in which three typically and trendily attractive teen idiots and their odd wheel young friend-- who made their little camping group seven instead of six-- spend some time in the woods by a lake.  This little virgin dude without no girlfriend basically gets on everyone's nerves, so they drink some beers, tell him by the campfire that the Mothman's crib is nearby, and then decide to all go swimming yet again to prove they're not afraid.  While treading water, they take turns going under to snatch little guy by the ankles and pull him under.  Predictably he drowns, and after a moment of misplacing him, they find his body floating face up some feet away.  They pull him onto the dock, do about seven limp wristed chest compressions, then pronounce him dead without taking a pulse.  Not wanting to take the rap for this, they decide to agree on a story that keeps them all out of trouble.  What is the story?  That he swam out and got tired and drowned, oops so sorry, in lieu of flowers donate to a charity?  Why NO, nothing so logical.  They take turns slamming a rock into his skull so they can tell the authorities he hit his head!

It's one of those moments where you gotta wonder, did no one on the set-- the director, an actor, a key grip, the monkey wrangler, ANYONE, didn't ANYONE say out loud, Guys, that's just f***ing dumb!  Nope.

Fast forward 10 years and they're all local losers except the one who was most hesitant to join the skullcrush club a decade before.  She leaves, but returns as a reporter to do a story on the local 'Mothman Festival'.  They have a chilly reunion in a bar where one of the guys sees a lame effect of red eyes in spilled booze on the table.  The same dude then drives his pickup (of course) back to his trailer (of course) where he loads a shotgun (of course) before getting attacked by a red eyed bat winged cartoon with a big mouth!  WTF!  That's when I pulled the plug.

It's not going to get any better after 23 minutes of that.  I can't get my money back, but take my advice-- you're not missing anything up in here!",1319932800,9,2552,4.382978723404255
8470667,3,B005FUTBSC,Not as good as the newer Richard Gere....version but  was ok,1519257600,,60,4.454545454545454
8470668,4,B005FUTBSC,"RELEASED TO TV IN 2010 and directed by Sheldon Wilson, ""Mothman"" details events in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, where a group of friends hide the truth about the death of one of their friends. Years later, when one of the group returns to town (Jewel Staite), a supernatural creature with links to the unjust slaying of Cornstalk in 1777 preys on them due to their guilt of murder. Jerry Leggio plays the old blind man who has interesting insights about the Mothman.

Some people were disappointed with 2002s The Mothman Prophecies because it was a mystery/horror film that shot for art and depth (and, in my opinion, succeeded) when what they really wanted was a conventional monster movie. Well, Mothman quells that desire as its a straight creature feature. Being a TV flick, though, it only cost $2 million while The Mothman Prophecies was a theatrical release that cost $32 million eight years earlier. As such, its no surprise that the latter is the superior production. Yet that doesnt mean Mothman isn't worth checking out if you appreciate TV-budget monster movies now and then.

The prologue where someone inadvertently dies during youthful festivities in the woods is well done, except for elements of the cover-up. Theres simply no reason that the teens couldn't have reported the kid simply drowned and they found the body. But it could be argued that they were young, dumb & drunk/high. I was too at one time.

I liked the whole fictional linkage of the Mothman to Hokoleskwa (aka Cornstalk), which showed imagination in the scripting. Jewel is a worthy female protagonist and I didn't have a problem with the no-name cast who surrounded her (Connor Fox, Jess Sylvia, Susie Abromeit, Michael Aills & Matty Ferraro).

As for the cartoony CGI monster, I actually found it kinda scary the first time I watched this movie (back when it originally came out) and even had a nightmare about it, which is something that almost never happens  (these types of flicks rarely scare me, but I find them entertaining). Viewing the film again 7.5 years later, the monster isn't quite as effective as I remembered it, perhaps because a similar type of creature was used in the same directors superior Scarecrow (2013).

It goes without saying that you shouldnt look to this movie for much accuracy about the Mothman sightings in 1966 Point Pleasant, which culminated in the December 15, 1967, collapse of the Silver Bridge and the death of 46 people. The movie simply uses the Mothman lore as a springboard for its own story.

THE FILM RUNS 91 minutes and was shot in Denham Springs, Louisiana, and points nearby. WRITERS: Sonny Lee & Patrick Walsh.

8470672,1,B005FUTBSC,"This film has earned a place of dishonor in the top 10 worst movies I have ever seen. I read a Mothman story when I was a kid and so was interested in the lore. This movie was set in the town where the original sightings were said to occur, but that's about where the similarity ended. The acting was abysmal, the production values were bottom shelf, the settings were bland and did nothing to enhance the atmosphere, and the story (what there was of it) was beyond stupid. The initial setup was so ridiculous I could never get past it; that scenario essentially ruined the credibility of everything that followed.

Instead of taking the subtle, creepy approach like the excellent ""Mothman Prophecies"" did, this movie featured a monster that was a cross between the mask in Scary Movie and the Mummy, when he opens his mouth to emit flies. Fake, not even accidentally scary, and surrounded by lore that was as clichd and insulting as the rest of the film (and barely based on the eyewitness accounts of the alleged sightings, if at all).
