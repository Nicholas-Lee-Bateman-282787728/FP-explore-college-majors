8093563,2,B000BWG11Y,Wonderful animation and story arc. Terrible Sound quality. Nearly impossible to clearly hear what the characters are saying...and this is a series about a TALKING lion. This is a great series that deserves better remastering treatment,1398729600,3,234,5.527777777777778
8093564,1,B000BWG11Y,"Leo the Lion is a classic anime series; basically it's the second season of Kimba The White Lion. Confusingly, the series has been made available on DVD by more than one company. These DVDs by the Palm Beach company could not possibly have been checked for quality before being released. The sound on each and every episode is unbelievably, horribly distorted. Yes, you can make out the words, but you'll think someone kicked in the speaker in your TV set.

In addition, each episode on these particular DVDs is shortened by having as much as 5 minutes cut out of it--there is no reason for this in a DVD release.

I don't know why they couldn't have produced a decent product. The English version of this series was dubbed uncut; why are these shortened versions on these DVDs? This classic series certainly deserves better treatment. If you look around the 'net a little, you can find better DVDs of this series.",1130889600,12,914,4.670807453416149
