5671625,5,B00BTFK09G,This is a low budget film with a high budget feel. Great directing by director Jason Murphy.  I highly recommend this film!,1374105600,2,123,4.590909090909091

5671627,5,B00BTFK09G,"If you are into ghost stories, this is your movie.  Scary mixed with some humor, but definitely ghost from beginning to end.

5671628,4,B00BTFK09G,"A young woman moves into an apartment complex and make a friend, only to find herself haunted by a little boy and his creepy clown toy. There is also an apparently dangerous neighbor. But there is much more to it than what you might be thinking by now. Very much worth seeing.  Good dialogue too.",1373328000,7,296,4.381818181818182
5671629,3,B00BTFK09G,"Sara (Aurelia Riley) is recently divorced and has some self esteem and emotional issues as she moves into her new apartment. The apartment is haunted by the boy on the cover (Ryan Quinn Smith). Sara consults a psychic (Warwick Davis) and is aided by her high testosterone neighbor, Tommy (Patrick Flanagan).

Sara paints and has the annoying habit of frequently showering with her back to the camera. The ghost causes havoc but wasn't particularly frightening. The best part of the film is Sara fending off young Tommy. The movie moves along as expected. The ending has a wicked twist which I enjoyed and didn't see coming. At this point I liked the movie more, but failed to capture the genius of the work having been lulled into a state of mediocrity while watching it.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Some suggestive talk.",1373155200,,838,4.8125
5671630,3,B00BTFK09G,"I've mentioned this before in some of my previous book reviews, but I am an absolute sucker for a good ghost story; as such, the same can be said for ghost movies as well.  The problem is that they seem to be few and far between.  With modern-day films about ghosts, we many times get rehashed genre staples that don't break any new ground.  Fortunately, THE UNBROKEN does not adhere to that description.  Although not perfect, this film does entertain, if you can make your way through it.

I have to tell you up front that it was sorta difficult for me to get through the first 3/4 of this film.  Overall, the movie is pretty well done...but the acting started bugging me pretty quickly into it.  This is particularly true for the character of Tommy, portrayed by Patrick Flanagan.  Whether it is his acting style or the scriptwriting, the dialogue he presents just seems forced and unrealistic.

But, THE UNBROKEN does keep you intrigued enough along the way to look past that.  The mystery that Sarah instantly becomes involved with is interesting and kept me guessing right up to the end.  No matter what I thought was happening in the film, I was wrong, and it was a nice twist at the end that made me smile in appreciation.

The film is shot well and the special effects look pretty good, especially considering the lower-ended budget.  The acting, as mentioned above, is where the film stalls for me, though.  I would not consider it to be enough of a deterrent to keep you from watching the film, but I do have to warn you in advance not to expect Oscar-worthy performances.

Still, if you can find the will-power to muster through THE UNBROKEN, the ending should justify your time (for the most part).  I'm going to give a neutral recommendation on this one, however, because some folks may not want to devote an hour and 40 minutes to this.  But I enjoyed it and am glad I fought to the end.  The film is available now on DVD and VOD.",1372204800,37,1945,4.492877492877493
5671631,2,B00BTFK09G,"A recent divorcee moves in to a new apartment complex in the hopes of starting over, but the recurring image of a little boy refuses to let her rest until the mystery behind his disappearance can be solved. THE UNBROKEN is another bland and boring ghost story that falls back on all of the same tired cliches the genre has to offer. Lead actress Aurelia Riley tries desperately to inject some energy into an otherwise lifeless production, which is brought down further by Daniel Baldwin as the film's unconvincing villain. The special effects also fail to impress, with the sparing use of cheap make-up and broken glass added for the occasional fright. If one can overcome the lengthy opening, there is at least enough action in the final act to drag the audience grudgingly through to the end. Fans of David Goyer's THE UNBORN are the only ones that are likely to enjoy this film, if they even exist.

5671632,3,B00BTFK09G,"I have to admit, I got this movie just because Warwick Davis was in it...and I didn't really expect much. This is a low-budget film and is a little slow to get going, but I actually found myself really getting into it and enjoying the characters. Daniel Baldwin (how many of them are there???) was surprisingly good as the menacing neighbor. If you are looking for a horror film, you will probably be disappointed, but as a low-budget thriller, this one is actually pretty good.",1370908800,7,478,4.635294117647059
5671633,4,B00BTFK09G,"Maybe my opinion is biased by my nostalgia, having grown up in the 80's and spent many a muggy summer night renting movies like April Fools Day, Woodchipper Massacre and Witchboard. The Latter of which this film reminded me of, especially the feel, the red headed lead even has a semi revealing shower scene ala Tawny Kitaen-although I think this was more coincidence rather than homage. Warwick Davis is great (duh)-Daniel Baldwin shows the other less adept performers how to convincingly chew through the dialogue. Movies like this have found a stable venue on channels like SyFy and Lifetime not just DVD and streaming, which makes for ample places to hopefully stumble upon it. I watched the movie in the company of my adult son and enjoyed it, but would have no problem having watched it with my gal-pal who is not a fan of horror movies-especially since this one feels more like suspense.

5671641,4,B00BTFK09G,"Nice ghost story, not great, after all it had one of the Baldwin brothers in one of the lead parts. Needless to say, I find their acting ""abilities"" lacking. Plus, towards the end the main character began to unravel into doing stupid things, let me mention 'shed'. The other lead actor, Patrick Flanagan, became one of my favorite guy character in a horror movie and I have been watching horror movies longer than the average American has been around. He was a quirky, funny, nice guy with good intentions, the kind I would like around while dealing with a ghost and a criminal.

5671643,1,B00BTFK09G,"While watching this, I found myself wondering if Daniel Baldwin had a back-tax bill with the IRS that necessitated him taking any role available.  This is a mess of bad dialogue, incoherent character development and some pretty terrible acting -- yes, the script sucked, but the main character actors can't entirely blame their performances on that.  I have to admit that I haven't seen much of Daniel Baldwin to judge him overall as an actor, but his performance was stand-out bad.  This is classic modern Hollywood -- no matter how bad the product, foist it off on someone to recoup some of an idiotic investment.  Frankly, if I had a business that produced a product this bad, I'd scrap it out of sheer embarrassment.",1483142400,,720,4.782258064516129

Lots of holes during the movie that don't get filled, yet, unlike some others, I thought the ending was pretty dam spooky, (if you discount the load of nonsense leading up to it and can make it to the end of a movie that's got nothing going for it except for the end.

5671727,2,B00BTFK09G,"Gems of believable dialog from supporting cast members who were clearly polished acting veterans, made the two main characters stiff, lackluster and predictable.  Lacking the many fine nuances of realistic delivery that is gained over time studying solid method courses, they made the movie come off more like a high school dress rehearsal.  It's a shame - since the audience could not have been less prepared for the twisted ending.  An equally-balanced/talented cast could've really made this movie a winner...  bringing the truly surprising end to a memorable climax.",1456704000,,570,5.370786516853933

5671742,3,B00BTFK09G,"First things first, about 20 minutes into the movie I had already predicted just about everything that would take place. I continued to watch to see if and/or how right I was. The little boy isn't as 'spooky/demented/scary' as the picture makes him out to be. There's nothing really scary about him. I found him to be cute. His little toy is disturbing and creepy though. Tommy is my second favorite character from this movie, he brings a number of laughs. The other ""neighbors"" are mostly annoying but Sarah (the main character) is the worst, most clueless, stupid & annoying one in this movie. Examples?
1) How hard is it to understand the pretty obvious & clear hints that like a 5 or 6 year old 'ghost' child is giving you? Plus she doesn't seem to be able to understand the fact that he is a GHOST! You can't cause him physical harm!

2) If you're going to go and 'sneak' around, you do NOT turn on all the lights!

Basically, Tommy & the little boy made the movie for me which is why I've given it a 3 star rating. If I were to ever watch this movie again, I'd only watch up until a certain point but that is a very huge if.",1450051200,,1130,4.251162790697674

This was certainly better than some other flicks of the same genre that rely on jump scares or ridiculous stunts to capture the interest of the audience. I guess I am old fashioned because I prefer a story that allows for the audiences' imagination to fill in the blanks (Lady in Black 1). The digital generation doesn't always have the patience for good yarn.
Granted the acting was mediocre even by the one recognizably named actor but you can hang that at the director's feet. Even good actors can falter with poor direction and limited directing imagination.",1421884800,,813,4.575342465753424

5671927,4,B00BTFK09G,"This is the story of Sarah (Aurelia Riley), a recently divorced young painter who, for seven years, gave up her art for her cheating husband. She's moving back to her old stomping grounds in order to make a new start. Weird things begin to happen almost immediately in her new apartment complex. She barely misses hitting a little boy as she drives in the parking lot, but when she get out of the car all she finds is a creepy clown doll who has a penchant for laughing at just the right moment. Then she meets Tommy (Patrick Flanagan), her landlord's nephew, when he comes to help her move in. He's a goofy, but likable young man and he and Sarah hit it off after a somewhat rocky start.

As she settles in and begins to paint, mysterious occurrences keep her on edge, but somehow she manages to create paintings that so impress her friend/agent that she arranges a showing for her in her gallery. In the meantime, bizarre visitations, a sinister neighbor and recurring nightmares keep Sarah busy.

Sarah is appealing, likable and genuine. Another reviewer came down hard on her performance, but I thought, for the most part, her work was substantial. Her interaction with Tommy was sweet, warm and believable. I expected more from Daniel Baldwin but he sort of just phoned it in. It was really obvious to me that he felt this role was beneath his stature as a ""star."" More than one reviewer praised Mr. Baldwin's performance as the saving grace of the movie, but to me it was just kind of meh. The rest of the actors were passable but not great.

At times the dialogue is a little awkward and there's one scene in particular where Sarah and Bruce (Daniel Baldwin), the slimy neighbor, are walking and talking; this scene did make me cringe because you could tell that neither actor was feeling it at all. A few of the other reviewers have seriously panned this movie; granted, it's not a big Hollywood production with a huge budget and big name stars (except for Daniel Baldwin (ha)), however, I thought it was nicely done. The cinematography was professional, the music was appropriately disquieting, and the performances of the main characters were actually quite effective.

The plot seemed predictable at first, but then, I realized that I really didn't know what was going on. The ending was very unexpected and made the whole movie worth the time I spent watching. I appreciate a movie that surprises me. Having seen literally hundreds of movies in the last sixty years, it takes a lot to unnerve me, but this stealthy little gem did just that. If you like suspense and you're willing to put up with a little amateur hoo-ha, this is a good way to pass a couple of hours.",1414627200,,2678,4.619747899159663

It's no movie to actually actively watch- front and center on the T.V. with a bowl of popcorn and a beer.  It would have been a waste of good popcorn and beer.  1) The acting stinks.  In fairness to the actors, however, it's tough to act well when the dialogue stinks.  2)  The dialogue stinks.  It's as wooden as the project I'm working on in my shop and unbelievable.  One scene shows our two heroes arguing out on the street insulting each other in what was probably meant as some sort of comic relief.  Besides highlighting that this movie doesn't need comic relief (it just needs relief in the form of being euthanized), the dialogue highlights the lack of chemistry between the actors.  And, of course, the screen writer wrote this scene because it's the standard off-the-shelf formula for any bad movie of any genre (horror, cop, western, scifi, Disney kid flick) where two different personalities have to team up to solve some sort of mystery).  In fact, the whole plot is pretty much off-the-shelf formula.  3)  The plot stinks.  Unimaginative and completely predictable.  No surprises including the creepy twist at the end.  About half into the movie, it's evident there can only be one possible creepy twist ending, so it's a simple matter to backtrack as to how the movie will unfold.

Or does she? When she gets out of the vehicle, all she finds in front of her car is a clown doll. When she moves in, strange things start to happen, and she begins to see the boy. With the assistance of the landlord's grown son, she tries to rid herself of the ghost. As part of these efforts, she visits a shop run by a psychic (Warwick Davis of the Leprechaun and Harry Potter films). At first, his suggestions seem to work. That's at first. Throughout all of this, Sarah is trying to figure out what the ghostly child wants and what the story is about her creepy neighbor (played by Daniel Baldwin).

The ending of the film is, I imagine, supposed to be a big twist. It's clever, though not unprecedented. And I suppose there was a sense among the makers that the ending was on a par with that of The Sixth Sense. But if they did think so, they were, I think, unduly optimistic.

There is a fair amount to like here. I think Daniel Baldwin is generally solid (though it's hard to understand his thought process in selecting roles given that he was in both Stripperland and Christmas with a Capital C in 2011), and he does about as much as he can with this role. The plot is, as I said, clever. And the three main actors do a solid job (other reviews here notwithstanding). The problem, though, is that the film could have been so much more. It could have been scarier; true scares are few here. (That's probably because the film is so light. Most of the scenes take place during daylight.) The mystery of the ending could have been more firmly established so that it becomes a true ""wow"" ending. And it would have been nice to have more explanation, a better answer to the question ""Why?""

This film isn't the worst way to pass 90 or so minutes. But it could have been so much more.",1396828800,,1956,4.281081081081081
5672021,3,B00BTFK09G,"I'm not talking horror comedy, just tongue in cheek horror. It was a way to pass some nonprimetime viewing time, and I didn't resent having rented it. There were many funny, entertaining moments (Tommy was a good character, well played) and it was quite a puzzle that I enjoyed solving. I kinda got it after the climax. ""Thanks for playing with me."" I like that twist. Won't be clear so as to spoil it for anyone. A light hearted horror flick that is enjoyable if not at all disturbing.",1396656000,,486,4.47191011235955
5672022,1,B00BTFK09G,"plain and simple, waste of a feature. i would have taken all the talent and money and make a badass short instead.

if the filmmakers are reading this u fail to take ur head out of ur ass and see this is 100 minutes of garbage.

gotta love warwick davis though, also if u close ur eyes daniel baldwin sounds like alec at times.",1395446400,,327,4.09375

It wasn't scary and it wasn't interesting - the acting and directing both were bad.  I think from now on, I'll just stick to the Prime Instant Videos.  At least if those movies are bad, I haven't paid for them.",1386547200,,319,4.19672131147541

All of these high reviews have got to be written by either people in the film or close family members of those involved.
Horrible acting, horrible cheesy effects. The only highlight was the guy that was the landlords nephew (Patrick Flanagan). He was kind of funny.

8573601,3,B00BTFK09G,"This movie was free with my Amazon Prime so worst case scenario, I lost time. The movie could have gotten its point across in 1:20 minutes instead of 1:40 - which was quite torturous with the girl's awful acting. It was obvious this was either her first movie or something because her expressions were rather contrived. It was painful to watch. What made it tolerable was the supporting actor and Daniel Baldwin who actually comes from a skilled acting family. The ending had a rather decent twist which again, would have made the movie worth it had it not been so long.",1491177600,,570,4.598039215686274
