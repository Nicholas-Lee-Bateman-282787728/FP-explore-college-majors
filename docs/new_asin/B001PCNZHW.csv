3746877,1,B001PCNZHW,"this is not a stand up comedy dvd its a waste of time

3746878,4,B001PCNZHW,"This dvd is hilarious to me.  You have to really be a silly and goofy person to appreciate it.  That's Mike epps for you.  Some people say the scene with Barak and Michelle is offensive, but i just look at it as comedy.  I love the American Gansta skits as well as the alot of others.  Its just stupid, silly comedy.",1246924800,3,316,4.114754098360656
3746879,1,B001PCNZHW,"I've always been a fan of Mike Epps. I love the movies, but I watched most of this DVD on YouTube.  There's one sketch in particular were he and a black female are imitating Michele & Barack Obama in the White House that I found totally offensive to our first African American President & First Lady.  The skit was full of stereotypes and for Mike to go there, I was disappointed.  It's just not funny at all. Save your money. Watch it on YouTube.",1246060800,2,447,4.2976190476190474
3746880,1,B001PCNZHW,"i rented this movie from the redbox for $1.00 and im happy i did not pay any more than that. this movie is not funny.  this is not a movie with a script.  this dvd is filled with clips of mike epps talking to people on street , also clips of him doing stand up at different clubs, and differet skits that are not funny.  this dvd is not worth your time, even if your the biggest mike epps fan.  i would not recommened this dvd.  (sorry mike epps, please come hardeR than this!)",1244592000,2,477,4.031914893617022
3746881,1,B001PCNZHW,"SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! Unfortunately, Mike Epps is one of those comedians that does better in movies than stand up. I'm not sure if it's because the material is already there for him in movies but when it comes to his stand ups  he's lame!! It's like he didn't know he had a stand up and made the jokes up on the spot. I was watching this with a friend and he went to sleep!!! I'm funny when I want to be and I hate to be a critic for something I know I can't do especially for a living, but when it's your job you sorta have to know how to perform. Sorry Mike, stick to movies. God bless.",1243036800,2,585,3.9159663865546217

3746889,1,B001PCNZHW,It is a mix of stand up and mini sketches. Think SNL style. I personally found the sketches cheesy and the stand up not very funny. He never really gets rolling into a good riff because its always cutting away to another sketch.,1419724800,,228,4.325581395348837

3746901,1,B001PCNZHW,I watched this entire video and didn't laugh not even once. It was like he was making it up as he went along. The skits and the stand-up sections were terrible.,1305158400,,160,4.193548387096774
