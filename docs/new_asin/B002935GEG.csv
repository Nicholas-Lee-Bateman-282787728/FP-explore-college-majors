I like that nothing is absurd or trendy.... no stirring TRUFFLE OIL into everything or insisting that EVERY GREEN VEGETABLE IS KALE.

8357439,4,B002935GEG,"I don't think of myself as a beginner in the kitchen and I do a lot of cooking, but I'm mostly self taught from cookbooks, TV cooking shows, and things I've found on the Internet. I watch America's Test Kitchen with the idea of using it as sort of kitchen basic training. I think that it broadens my skills by showing me how to do some things I hadn't tried and gives me some hints and ideas which are even useful for the things I already do make. Overall, this series is really excellent for someone like me. I found some of the shows in Season 3 to be especially useful. If you want to learn to sear a steak and then make pan sauce you'll find a plain steak and a pepper steak version here. You'll see grilled pork chops with a spicy rub and smothered pork chops. You'll brown chicken fillets and again, make a pan sauce. You'll find a variety of classic pasta dishes. Seven shows cover baking, including a nice crusty European-style rustic bread and a long list of desserts.

With 26 shows included in this set, there is much more than I can describe here but almost everything is standard home cooking. Think mac and cheese, chili, barbecue, nachos with salsa and guacamole, or making Chinese takeout dishes at home. Everything presented was done well. I really enjoyed watching these shows and I will be returning to some of them again. I will certainly be more successful in the future with some of the dishes presented.

The only slight flaw is this set for me in all these older seasons is in the inclusion of some product and equipment reviews which are now a bit out of date. Some of the kitchen equipment they review is no longer for sale as newer models come out and older models are discontinued. Likewise, some food products they recommend are not available in my area.",1342310400,2,1783,4.4495412844036695
