313902,4,6301207947,I love most big band stories. The Fabulous Dorseys is exceptional. Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey play themselves which was great. The music is fantastic.,1185148800,,146,5.125
313903,4,6301207947,"This is a great movie that actually features the Dorsey's themselves.  The movie tells the story of Jimmie and Tommy Dorsey growing up and their start to the music business.  The story is good and the music is, of course, great.  My only complaint is that I wish the story would have featured more about their career and less about how the two couldn't get along and so they went their separate ways until their father died when they made up.  It's still a good movie and I do recommend it but if you're like me in wanting to learn more about the career you might actually prefer The Glenn Miller story.",1173484800,12,603,4.357142857142857
313904,4,6301207947,"I remember watching this movie as a child at my grandparent's house.

I loved the music. The acting was so-so but let's face it. The Dorsey's are not known as actors.

The premise of the movie is quite believable and the music is so typical of the 40's. I love all the movies from that decade.

It's just a good film. Enjoyable and will leave you with a smile on your face. A far cry from today's horrible and violent films. They don't make them like this any more and they should.

If you get to see it, just sit back and enjoy.",1093996800,20,529,4.106796116504855
313905,4,6301207947,"They were two brothers who were both in jazz but so different that they could not work together. At least till after the death of their father which brought them together for the production of the concerto of Janet Blair's husband's concerto, and yet under the conducting of a third party. But when they were together they made miracles particularly in their trombone-saxophone duets. The film shows how difficult life was for jazzmen at the beginning, but also how the radio transformed the spreading of this music, and then this spreading was amplified by the recording of their music on records. Jazz is typically American in its use of rhythm and new instruments like the saxophone, and old instruments like the clarinet and the trombone which are perfectly transformed in the process. But most of all, jazz would not have existed if they had not used the radio and records to reach the wider public. Jazz is the first music of modern ages. It was also a great success because it expresses life in our modern times of cars, factories, machines, industrialisation and mechanisation. People expected a new type of music in phase with this new life and jazz provided it to them. This film is thus both historically and humanly true and sensitive.

.
Standard kicks against THE FABULOUS DORSEYS are the non-acting skill of its leads, a lack of personal detail (such as the two youngest siblings not getting a mention) and its episodic story. True enough on all three counts, yet I saw this movie recently for the first time and found it thoroughly entertaining.

As depicted here, after years of feuding the Dorsey boys permanently split during a live performance at the Glen Island Casino, when Tommy stormed out due to a beef over tempo. Jimmy kept the Dorsey band, Tommy molded the Joe Haymes unit into his own orchestra (this last detail isn't explained).

After his acrimonous parting with Tommy in 1942 it's no surprise that Frank Sinatra's not included nor is his existence even acknowleged, but why the brothers' mid-20's stint in the California Ramblers gets no mention is curious. Their association with this renowned group of NY studio musicans led to the formation of their own recording outfit, with some of the Ramblers (like legendary bass saxist Adrian Rollini) joining them. Others who worked in-studio with the Dorseys between 1928 and '33: Jack Teagarden (trombone), Mildred Bailey (vocals), Frank Signorelli (piano), Glenn Miller (trombone), Bob Crosby (vocal), Bunny Berigan (trumpet), Johnny Mercer (vocals), Phil Napoleon (trumpet), Joe Venuti (violin) and Stan King (drums).

Regardless of how accurate a bio this is or how unpolished Jimmy and Tommy are as actors, musical performances are what the picture's really about. Jimmy's ""Green Eyes,"" with vocals by Bob Eberly and Helen O'Connell, and Tommy's ""Marie,"" with Stuart Foster taking over for Jack Leonard and everyone shouting refrains behind him, are delightful. Tommy also solos on his signature number, ""I'm Getting Sentimental Over You.""

Other highlights: amazing pianist Art Tatum does his own ""Turquoise,"" then Tommy, Jimmy, Ziggy Elman, Ray Bauduc and Charlie Barnet join Tatum for a late-night jam on ""Art's Blues."" In an earlier scene, the still struggling Dorseys are hired by Paul Whiteman; his band performs ""At Sundown.""

Bottom line: if you're a fan of Swing Era sounds, don't miss this one. You're gonna love it!

The brothers are always fighting with each other. When the boys are shown all grown up; the actual Dorsey-brothers appear and star in the film.

(5.5) The Fabulous Dorseys (1947) - Tommy Dorsey/Jimmy Dorsey/Janet Blair/Paul Whiteman/William Lundigan/Sarah Allgood/Arthur Shields/Dave Willock/William Bakewell/James Flavin",1284595200,,2412,5.381962864721485
314471,2,6301207947,"When I was eight years old, and beginning to learn the trombone, my parents went out and bought me a two record set--""The Great Tommy Dorsey Orchestra: I'm Getting Sentimental Over You.""  For the next eight years I worked to sound like him, until I discovered Bill Watrous in my teens, and eventually Jay Jay Johnson, Curtis Fuller, Frank Rosolino, and others.  I never lost my fondness for Tommy, though.

When I was younger, I was eager for footage of Dorsey playing.  One of my favorite films was A SONG IS BORN, with Danny Kaye, and featuring Dorsey along with Louis Armstrong, Lionel Hampton, Charlie Barnet, and many others including Benny Goodman in a real acting role.  Even after I had moved on from Tommy as a model, footage of the old big band leaders was gold to me.

I wonder what I would have thought of THE FABULOUS DORSEYS had I seen it then. Would I have been excited just to see Tommy and Jimmy talk and put their instruments together?  Or would I have noticed the difference between a film directed by Howard Hawks and one directed by, well, Alfred E. Green?

I think I would have been indulgent--the footage is of the Dorseys and others, after all.  But I don't think I would have remembered it fondly.  The film focuses on the embattled musical relationship between the two famous big band brothers, Tommy and Jimmy.  The brothers can't seem to play together without fighting, and the movie chronicles the efforts of the people around them to convince the brothers to set their differences aside and play together--their apparently strict but really sentimental father, their loving mother, and their unexplained non-sister ""Jane"" (presumably a fictional replacement for their actual sister Mary--who may not have wanted to be included).

Green tells the story capably enough--but he tells it without much music.  The only real musical highlights are full performances of ""Marie"" by the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra, and ""Green Eyes"" by the Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra (the two songs which would appear on different sides of the same single in 1954 when they were really reunited), and a jam session featuring Tommy and Jimmy playing with Charlie Barnet, Ziggy Elman, and Art Tatum.  And that is the sum total of the musical interesting moments of the film.

That might be forgiven if the story was even remotely interesting.  But the attempt to clean up and simplify actual events is disappointing, especially to anyone who actually knows something about the brothers.  The distinction of the two boys by instrument is understandable, if a little silly; both brothers, like most people who play music for a living, played several instruments and would often each double on trumpet in the early days of their association.  But other details are also left out.  Tommy's perfectionism and poor sense of humor are depicted, but very little of his somewhat violent temper and his lurid love life.  The fact that the brothers were both more successful on their own is never explored--so insistent is the film on its own master-plot of bringing the two of them back together.

One explanation for this would be that the reunion between the brothers was in the works when the film first appeared.  Driven by the promotional needs of the musical reunion, Green's work is bent on representing the potential greatness of the two brothers when they join forces.  In the film itself, by the way, the agency of the reunion is their participation in a concerto featuring trombone and clarinet and conducted by the venerable Paul Whiteman.  There is no need to reflect on the value of this moment from a musical standpoint.  Does anyone even know of a recording of this distinguished moment?  Has it appeared on any of the ""Best Of"" collections of either brother?

The other explanation is Green himself.  His later career includes a number of biopics--THE FABULOUS DORSEYS, THE JOLSON STORY, THE JACKIE ROBINSON STORY, THE EDDIE CANTOR STORY--so perhaps he was seen as the man to use in that genre.  But a look at his whole career will show you that he was quite prolific in directing movies-you've-never-heard-of.

A year after THE FABULOUS DORSEYS came out, Howard Hawks' Danny Kaye vehicle, A SONG IS BORN was released.  If you really want to watch a fun movie about the big bands, buy that one.",1279670400,,4294,4.8491083676268865
314472,5,6301207947,This is the very first movie I ever owned. I bought it on 16MM sound film about 60 years ago. Since then it still has a magic all its own. One of the best big-band movies ever made.,1276473600,,181,3.789473684210526
314473,3,6301207947,"I am a collector of the early movies. The stories and music and acting usually are so much better than the average movie today.

This story of the Dorseys was good. The quality of the picture, however, was as if a Dvd was made off of a VHS. This should not be.

7809883,3,6301207947,OK! The movie is kinda stupid! Silly plot. I only bought to upgrade my VHS version of this movie. And that was just to see and hear JD and TD. A couple of years before this movie was made TD had been making a string of great movie musicals for MGM. MGM dropped TD like a lead balloon after TD got into a fight with Jon Hall (future Rama of the Jungle star) at his mansion in Hollywood. Very bad publicity for the short tempered TD. Too bad for posterity.,1492819200,,454,4.055555555555555
