Outstanding cinematography, mesmerising music score, suspenseful, skilfully choreographed battle scenes. Shot on location (the desert is real not CGI) and the cast is excellent.

Jackie Chan's powerful performance showcases his wide range of acting abilities. At the beginning he entertains us with martial arts and comedy but as the story unfolds, his role becomes dramatic and Jackie makes the transition with subtlety. Once again he proves that he is not just an action star, but also a very fine, accomplished drama actor.
John Cusack rates high and Adrian Brody impresses with his portrayal of Tibeirus, a sadistic and corrupt Roman Emperor.

The plot:
In 2015 an American archaeological company bought military manuscript from the Hun Dynasty, which said that Roman soldiers went to China about 2,000 years ago and built a city called Regum. The company believed that the manuscript is fake, but set on a journey to investigate. Two of its stuff found Regum. Among the ruins they discovered a monument with detailed inscription which as they read, fades into the main story.

China in 48 BC. Jackie Chan is Huo An, a Hun, serving as the captain of the Protection Squad Silk Road.
John Cusack is Lucius, a Roman general, who flees to the east with his legion and Publius, a heir of the ruling Roman Consul. They run for their lives from the Emperor Tiberius. At the frontier fort on Silk Road they meet Huo An. The legion helps finish construction of the fort.

In the mean time Tiberius and his army, who have pursued Lucius along the Silk Road, approaches the fort with intend to capture and control the Silk Road. An epic battle begins, which ends with dramatic & deadly one-on-one combat.
Back in the present, the two archaeologists are deeply moved by the story and have to make decision.

I envy my American friends for the priviledge they have to simply pop up to the nearest cinema and experience Jackie Chan's magic! Go and see it. A chance in a life time!",1436313600,12,2130,4.808743169398907

8720000,5,B00ZESM5OC,Better than its reputation film is much better than in it's full Asian cut. The recent American release cut out around 25 minutes. Despite what I had been told that's not all the modern day framing device which fills only about five or seven minutes of screen time. There are lots of little bits that fill in plot wholes and make transitions smoother. Is this a great film? Probably not but it is entertaining and perfect for curling up on a couch with nice big bowl of popcorn.,1455753600,,478,4.443181818181818
8720001,2,B00ZESM5OC,"Boring stuff, Jackie just doing the same old things nothing new or different. It was like watching all his other fights. This is the Chinese version which is 25 minutes longer which was a disappointment it made a bad movie worst. Save your money and don't buy it.",1454371200,,263,4.5

8720004,2,B00ZESM5OC,"The only thing that makes this movie of Jackie Chan different than other of his period movies is the Chinese fighting against the Romans! Of course its a history imagination. I can forgive this history rewriting but I cannot forgive its other weaknesses. The drama and the fighting scenes are very much the same as other movies of Jackie. They are so similar that they become boring.

For drama, I prefer Jackie in Shinjuku Incident.
For period movies, I prefer Jackie in The Legend of Drunken Master.",1445126400,,501,4.758620689655173

8720006,4,B00ZESM5OC,"I watched this film while taking an 8 hour flight, and I selected this film because I had seen the others, and when I read the plot I thought it would be hilarious. They might as well have named the film ""Jackie Chan does Rome!"" So I went in expecting a cheesy Chinese Epic.

And for the most part it was. It was overacted, the plot was ridiculous, the action cool but typical of a Chinese war epic. And it had John Cusack trading scenes with Adrian Brody who was so over the top as the villain he might as well have had a mustache to twist evilly.

It was great.

First, there's some real heart in the film, both in the way Jackie Chan puts everything he has into the role and how the production does everything it can to overcome a bad screenplay. I'm a fan of Cusack, but half the time he looks completely bored - but then that's kind of his style. It works in most roles but here it comes across as detached. Brody is just completely nonbelievable as the requisite villain, he's almost trying too hard to put as much venom into every line and stare daggers and sneer at everything. But this is typical of most Asian action movies, so it's a little forgiveable.

The fight scenes fall into two categories - the one on one (or small group) battles which are forgettable, and then the full army scenes which are magnificent, especially at the end of the film. The cinematography of the battles show lessons have been learned and lessons can be taight from this film on how to film an ancient battle.

Finally, there is the music, which is exquisite. A mix of Eastern, West Asia, and Mediterranean styles which match perfectly. One song in particular that gave me chills was ""Light of Rome"". Listen to it on Youtube. It's beautiful, and in the context of the movie (which I won't spoil here) it works perfectly.

Overall, I don't think this is an amazing movie, but it is a movie that I was surprised to discover how much I liked it and how it turned out much better than I expected. I plan to buy it at some point and enjoy it on a much larger screen than the one I used on the back of an airplane chair.",1443225600,4,2105,4.276381909547739
