1205372,5,B00000F482,"Although I have only seen this movie once, I found it terrific and am in the process of buying it. I don't remember all the plot (it starts and ends in a nudist colony), but it is an indictment of the industrial revolution as it has been mangled by Madison Avenue, unions, and government agencies (British style.) A '50s classic that was ahead of its time. A sly film.",1024531200,2,368,4.3478260869565215
7907313,5,B00000F482,"One of the best Ealing comedies. Peter Sellars at his funniest, his accent is hilarious and so brilliantly accurate for the type.",1506470400,,129,4.909090909090909
7907314,4,B00000F482,"Unless you are well-versed in mid-20th century UK history you may find this comedy a bit obscure, but it has its moments of sheer brilliance. The human condition, personal and public, is shown in all its inglorious manifestations: lust, greed, envy, stupidity, sloth, and so on. The quality of the cast helps pull some of the more absurd moments off. Americans watching this may not get all the humour, at least not without subtitles.",1486252800,,434,4.878378378378378
7907315,5,B00000F482,An early Sellers classic. From an era before one-star movies so great supporting cast. Any Sellers fan who has not seen this at least once is not a true fan.,1481241600,,157,4.266666666666667
7907316,3,B00000F482,"Disappointing. The reviews gave Sellers a knockout review. In my opinion only the last 10 minutes were funny. Of course, 60 years ago this might have been considered very funny. It predates by five years Mel Brooks ""The Producers,"" which started the making of crazy movies from first frame to end.",1475366400,,297,4.8431372549019605
7907317,3,B00000F482,"Oldie but goodie, this movie's best moments are from Peter Sellers as a union shop steward in 1950s Britain.  Margaret Rutherford has only a minimal role, alas.  For aficionados of post World War II,  50's-era British comedies, this film will satisfy; others might find it tedious.",1438992000,,281,5.065217391304348
7907318,3,B00000F482,"Fair - saw it years ago, not a good a I seem to remember.",1433635200,,57,3.142857142857143
7907319,5,B00000F482,"A very funny - and prescient - look at the UK Labour situation of the 1950s...worth the watch not only to see Peter Sellers in one of his first roles, but to understand what actually took place during the 1960s...",1431648000,,213,4.35
7907320,5,B00000F482,Great film. Old cassette in excellent condition. Incredible low price compared to DVD.,1412380800,,86,5.6923076923076925
7907321,5,B00000F482,I saw this movie on cable and had to have it.  It was hysterical!  The second viewing was even better (like most Peter Sellers).  Enjoyable early comedy of his!,1245283200,,160,4.448275862068965
7907322,4,B00000F482,"Amazing, and sad, that many American movie-goers think Peter Sellers' career began with ""The Pink Panther."" In fact he had been starring in films for almost a decade before that release.  Unfortunately the terrific British comedies of the Fifties and Sixties just didn't get wide enough release in our insular U.S. film market.  This is one of Sellers' highlights, a great project about the tug-of-war between industry and labor that, to some extent, still bedevils the UK today.  Many of his friends remarked over the years that Sellers only came fully alive when he was playing somebody else; but no one topped him at exploring the comic nuances of a character he had fully nailed, like union boss Fred Kite here.  Helps that he is surrounded by a great cast; and why can't Britain make them like this any more?",1096070400,9,813,4.785714285714286
