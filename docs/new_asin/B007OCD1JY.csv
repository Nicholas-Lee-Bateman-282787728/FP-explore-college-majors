5101574,5,B007OCD1JY,If you like The Raconteurs and/or Jack White this is a must have!  A truly great performance with a lot of energy.  I have seen them live and this truly does their performances justice.  Excellent video work.  And superb audio definition!  I am audiophile and this one is spot on... I sat back and cranked it up and loved every bit of it!,1343001600,3,338,4.301587301587301
5101575,5,B007OCD1JY,"Not only am I a Raconteurs fan, but I also hold the belief that Jack White is deserving of a certain respect for his tremendous influence on contemporary rock music. As an avid collector of concert DVD/BRs, I seldom find a show that can be considered a ""modern classic"" -- let alone one available in blu ray format. I think it's fair to say that most collections out there are dominated by artists whose careers peaked during generations past. If any specific live performance should be chosen to best encapsulate the current state of rock music, then this would be that show.

In short, it is 1.5 hours of a performance that brings down the house. It's a hypnotic balance between raw energy and focused perfectionism highlighted by hi-def recording techniques that are still making their way to mainstream live recording releases. Each instrument from the lead and rhythm guitars to the keyboard, bass guitar and drums came through as detailed and articulated while not overbearing and exaggerated. With Jack White and Brendan Benson trading off on microphone duties throughout the set, we hear an entire spectrum vocal characteristics that ranged from the guttural to the classic screaming howl. Jack makes use of an assortment of sound effects equipment including a tweaked second microphone, with each effect adding more intensity to an already-exhilerating show.

It creates a listener's perspective reminiscient of Stevie Ray Vaughn's ""Live at the Mocambo"" in that the depth and presence of the performance seem to transcend the small, albeit more ""personal"" venue layout. There's a serendipitous edge to it -- as though the audience just happened to drop in to have a beer with some friends, only to discover that ""tonight's act"" went beyond justifying the $5 cover charge. The band is there to play music for the sake of playing music, not for the thrill of being in front of 50,000 screaming fans. The mood is authentic, and the direction is spontaneous, without intention.

The 1080P video quality together with surreal stage lighting take full advantage of the blu ray format. Has a Montreux video ever looked this good? Better yet, do any shows currently on the market look this good? My answer would be biased by my appreciation for the music itself, but I would be surprised to see disappointment from an objective viewer in relation to the visual delivery alone.",1341619200,7,2377,4.982367758186398
5101576,5,B007OCD1JY,"This might be one of the 10 best concert dvd's/Blu-Rays I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot.  If you have any inclination to buy this DVD/B-R, take my word: you will not regret this purchase.

I am of the opinion that The Raconteurs is probably the best of Jack White's projects - just a personal leaning/favorite, given the pedigrees of everyone in the band, so I was especially happy to see this come out, given that they only have (basically) two albums out (plus some loose singles & b-sides).  This is primo stuff - this show is their 2008 concert at the Montreux Jazz Festival, when they were touring ""Consolers of the Lonely"".  I saw them twice in L.A. on that tour, and this concert is at least as good as the two (stellar) shows that I saw.  It's a tight hour and a half consisting of 16 songs from the two albums, and I have to say it's a great set list, containing pretty much the key cuts that most Raconteurs fans will want to hear.  The best stuff here is the EPIC smoldering version of ""Blue Veins"" where they really let the song breathe (compared to the album version - this was a highlight of the live shows I saw), ""You Don't Understand Me"", ""Steady As She Goes"" and my personal favorite Raconteurs cut, ""Top Yourself"" (which Jack has been doing on his solo tour).  But truthfully, there is literally not a bad cut here, and the whole band looks like they're having a blast (Brendan sounds great, and Jack L. and Patrick really anchor the sound, plus there are keys/violin too), playing energetically, stretching out a bit and bringing something extra to the live versions that weren't on the records.  Start to finish, a great show.  I would recommend the blu-ray, which I watched w/ DTS sound on a 100"" screen - beautiful crisp hi-def picture, nice editing and good camerawork, all of which will make you think you were there.  If you are a fan of Jack White's projects, or the Raconteurs in particular, this is essential, no question about it.  Here's hoping he gets some comparable-quality White Stripes or ""Blunderbuss"" concerts out on Blu-ray.

If you end up liking this disc, check out some of the other Montreux concert discs - the Tori Amos, Mink Deville and Van Morrison ones are standouts, and there are many fine performances now available in the series.",1341014400,16,2284,4.557457212713937
8519851,4,B007OCD1JY,"The mixer takes a couple of songs to get the desk right and I assume we have a desk mix, because a studio remix should be much much better.
Having said that, this is a great rock show. It's raw and ready and if you like the band, I can't imagine that you wouldn't like this.",1495929600,,274,3.9107142857142856
8519852,5,B007OCD1JY,Ass kickin rock and roll from start to finish. Bass player looks like Amy from Big Bang Theory. Adds humor while you watch and listen.,1474329600,,134,4.4

8519854,5,B007OCD1JY,The Raconteurs are amazing!  Jack White is the greatest musician of his generation.  High quality disc with excellent audio as well.  Every song is killer and the overall performance is stellar.,1399161600,,194,5.193548387096774
8519855,5,B007OCD1JY,It has been played numerous X's! I picked this up for my hubby and he plays it day after day!,1397260800,,93,3.7
8519856,5,B007OCD1JY,No gimmicks here! This is just straight rock 'n roll DVD and it is great on the sound and visuals.,1363478400,,98,3.95
8519857,5,B007OCD1JY,"ordered. received. haven't gotten high enough to watch it yet, but i will soon. very soon. maybe tonight even. not sure.",1356912000,2,120,4.761904761904762
8519858,5,B007OCD1JY,Excellent concert and recording. But if you can only watch one song make sure it is Blue Veins. i think Jimmy and Robert would approve,1354579200,2,134,4.4
8519859,5,B007OCD1JY,"The audio is superb, the multi-cam back-and-forth is balanced, and the band is a face-melting, octopus of sonic bravado.  Watch, listen, and take notes if you ever want to put on a rock show.  The Racs are a model for raw, rock show supremacy.",1348704000,2,243,4.5
8519860,5,B007OCD1JY,"This blew my mind! The performance from The Raconteurs is most certainly one of the very best I have ever seen. They are more raw, more ""rock n' roll"" than any of the albums even hint at. The performance of Blue Veins is one of the most soulful, emotional moments I have ever seen on a music dvd/blu-ray. And for the price, it may be the best value.",1344297600,2,349,4.147058823529412
