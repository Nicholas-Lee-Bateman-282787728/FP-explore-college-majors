8652322,3,B00JM5C9F8,I love the story of Thomas and this movie shows his story well. It gives a good look of the love but doubts that Thomas had towards Jesus,1486252800,,137,3.9285714285714284
8652323,1,B00JM5C9F8,"When I was reading the credits at the end, I could not believe there were 5 biblical consultants in the making of this film. It was actually painful for me to sit through it. I forced myself hoping that at some point it would have a redeeming grace, since I bought it confidently. But, it deserves a review. Opening scene, Thomas goes running to Golgotha but he's late and finds Jesus' cross bare, but finds the 3 nails on the ground, with fresh blood, the Romans just left them there, so he puts them in his pocket (hint: crucifixion nails were very costly and the Romans always reused them). Then Thomas sees the procession. Did you know that a whole crowd of Jewish supporters, a squadron of Roman soldiers, plus several of the disciples including the women, and Joseph of Arimathea formed a parade with Jesus' body to the tomb? The tomb was this adorable free standing little house made of individual stones with a roof and a rectangular door. (And all this time, I thought it was hewn from rock with a round stone that could be rolled.) Thomas tried to retrieve Jesus' body from the tomb Friday evening and gets into a heated discussion with a Roman guard. On Saturday (the Sabbath, but hey, details), Thomas goes to Joseph of Arimathea, who takes Thomas (a wanted man) to see Caiaphas and they explain how it would be a good move if Caiaphas allowed the disciples to remove the body from the tomb in Jerusalem and take it to Galilee, and he agrees! And did you know that when Peter and John went running to the tomb early Sunday morning, Thomas accompanied them? Oh yeah, he was the one who folded up the linen and took it with him. Thomas is then desperately trying to find Jesus' body, because he doesn't believe in the Resurrection. A Roman guard tells Thomas he knows where the body of Jesus is and takes him to a public catacomb (really? oh yeah, public catacombs for people criminals and such) and there's all these dead bodies wrapped in linens on hewn rock slabs and some lying on the floor. One of them happens to be Barabbas. The Roman snorts and says, ""He got his."" They get into a fight, because Thomas says, ""This isn't The Master!"", and Thomas bangs the guard on the head and accidentally sets the place on fire (it's stone, but more details) but then goes back into the fire to pull him out. The guard says breathlessly, ""Why did you save me?"" ""Because Jesus would want me to."" Who wrote this script? Then Jesus has visited the other disciples and Thomas comes back and they all get into a discussion, there's a scene that needs editing. Thomas leaves the disciples and goes across the desert to a Roman outpost where the Romans send all the insane to find another young Roman guard who was blinded by the light at the Resurrection. He rescues him and takes him to another town so he can get help. At the very end, is a worthwhile scene, of Jesus appearing to the disciples again, and Thomas is there, back from all his journeys, in the room and Thomas, seeing him alive, believing. I've just mentioned a few of the scenes that are so far from biblical that I felt compelled to write this lengthy review. I had to save you. Jesus would want me to.",1456876800,10,3168,4.454388984509467

After watching the video, I just could not use it since it did not follow the Bible.  The makers took too many liberties with God.s word.",1427760000,4,250,4.276595744680851
