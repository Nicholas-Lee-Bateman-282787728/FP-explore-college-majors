5167149,3,B008I74CFQ,"This was an incredibly well written, well cast movie, interspersed with some absolutely terrible musical numbers.  I would probably watch this movie again, maybe even recommend it to friends, I would just warn them first about the strange parts.  I thought the story was great, and overall I really enjoyed it.",1353542400,10,310,5.0588235294117645
5167150,4,B008I74CFQ,"Good, small film made by independent filmmakers.  Talented cast and good original songs. Hope to see more from the cast and those involved with the production. Give it a shot. Also try to support their new internet series ""Easy Abby"".",1349827200,3,234,4.85
5167151,5,B008I74CFQ,Me and my three friends just rented this and were kind of floored by how good it is. The friendships and romances are believable and some of the lines are funny as hell! A LOT of very hot women too.,1349395200,11,198,3.975

5167153,1,B008I74CFQ,"Wow, was this ever bad.  I'm not sure what the creators of this movie were trying to accomplish but unless it was to make my ears cringe, then I don't think that they succeeded.  While there was some friendly chemistry between the primary characters, the rest of the movie was just atrocious.  The acting was bad, and the music was even worse.  I wasn't expecting a musical, but the performances were so bad that I'm not sure this wound up qualifying.  The romance angle wound up being very disappointing, the humor fell flat all the way across the board, and the story just dragged.  I really wish that I could say something positive here because I would like to support these independent projects that are inclusive of the LGBT community but from an entertainment standpoint, this movie just didn't have anything to offer.",1406592000,,824,4.7272727272727275
5167154,1,B008I74CFQ,I didn't feel like I really connect with any of the characters. The acting was mediocre and the songs were terrible!,1401926400,,116,4.571428571428571
5167155,5,B008I74CFQ,Love the movie it's kind of a musical which is fine with me Jess is great while Jamie is kinda a prick at times great story line they could have had one before this that would have been the precursor to this one to explain the girls connection a little better and this one could use some more nudity and skin but overall love the movie !!!,1398729600,3,339,4.074626865671642
5167156,4,B008I74CFQ,This was a really nice change of pace for a lesbian film. The actors did a good job and I thought it was filmed well and had some good music. Worth a watch.,1393200000,5,156,3.757575757575758
5167157,5,B008I74CFQ,"OK, maybe really only four stars, but this film is grossly underrated on Amazon.  If you were ever an early 20 something Lesbian and you don't expect every LGBTQ themed movie to be great art, you could have a great laugh.  Every single character in the movie except maybe the primary female lead is a complete caricature.  The aspect of it being a bit of a musical is kind of odd, and the sound quality of those scenes is pretty bad,  but if you just take it in as part of this film's quirkiness it is fine.  It is clearly very low budget, but the acting and the editing are sound.  It is clear everyone who was making this movie had a great time.  And boy, don't we all wish that some rich gorgeous woman will come sweep us off our feet, definitely didn't happen to anyone I knew in my early 20's.",1389571200,,798,4.176470588235294
5167158,5,B008I74CFQ,I loved the storyline and the realistic dialogue.  Queer women will appreciate its authenticity and relatability.  I will definitely recommend this movie to some of my friends.,1382140800,4,176,5.481481481481482
5167159,4,B008I74CFQ,"Jamie and Jessie ARE together, despite the title of this simple little lesbian friendship love affair being ""Jamie and Jessie are NOT Together"".
These two attractive young Chicago lesbians live together.....as friends.
Jamie looks butch, but when she drops her clothing, she's quite feminine.
She gets whatever she wants--acting roles, lovers---seemingly without effort.
Jessie is a cute girl, but she seems to always be behind Jamie in getting acting roles or girlfriends.
Oh yes, almost forgot.
They each seem to be secretly in love with each other.
It's two weeks before they're to separate for a year--Jamie's heading to NYC--leaving Jessie to finish school in Chicago.
The entire movie centers around, Will Jessie tell Jamie she loves her?
And does she?
There are a few musical numbers, making this sort of like ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"", but the lyrics here FIT with the rest of the dialogue.
Some reviewers didn't like the songs, but I did.
I just wish they had better trained the actors in lip synching!
Bottom line: ""Jamie and Jessie are NOT Together"" is a cute, endearing, quirky, and simple lesbian romance flick.
The sex scenes are few, and the nudity is limited.
This is about the lives of people, not a how-to in lesbian sex techniques.
Definitely worth 105 minutes of your time!
I should add that I watched this movie through Amazon Instant Video, as it's NOT now available on DVD in the United States.",1379203200,3,1419,4.916666666666667
5167160,1,B008I74CFQ,"Oh.  My.  God.  This movie is terrible.  It is so bad that I had to watch it in installments.  It is so bad that I couldn't stop laughing at how bad it was.  EVERY single minute got worse and worse.

First there was the actors themselves.  The two main ladies were the most unattractive women on the face of the earth.  The actors who played Jamie and Jessie both looked like they were 12 years old.  Everyone else looked like they were in their 40s but I think that was just because the other actors looked so young.  There was absolutely no sex appeal between any of the women.  Rape victims are more attracted to their rapist than the women were attracted to each other in this film.  Also here is a hint - If you want us to believe Jamie is such an amazing actor then you should probably get someone WHO CAN ACT!

The budget was obviously low which is fine but the sad part is that it was SOOO OBVIOUS!  We get it, you got permission to film at a park and a beach.  We get it.  I'm not even going to go into the fact that the wardrobe looked like a 5 year old picked out the clothes.  Maybe that's a new style I'm not aware of but it did definitely help add to the vacuum of sex appeal that was around.  Nothing says hot like two actresses in unflattering clothes looking like they haven't showered in 6 months.

But the best part of all (and by best I mean worst) was the singing.  OH MY GOD the singing!  Off key.  Out of tune.  Off beat.  Didn't rhyme.  Dubbing didn't match.  This was the best because there would be long patches of time where no singing would happen and then you were assaulted with three songs in a row for no reason and it was awkward and unnecessary.

Overall thank you thank you!  Gay films are in general the worst but this by far is in the top five of worst films ever!  It just leaves me with something to think about - Why do I keep watching?!?",1377129600,,1878,4.107734806629834
5167161,3,B008I74CFQ,It was a nice love story . The only thing I did't like was nowhere did I read it was a musical. It kind of took await from the movie . But I would watch it again fast forwarding the music part.,1374451200,,193,3.619047619047619
5167162,4,B008I74CFQ,I liked the movie because it was well done and I could relate to the whole fall in love with your best friend thing and then realize later on.,1372550400,,142,3.9310344827586206
5167163,3,B008I74CFQ,"I've seen much worse but I've seen much better. It was like Lesbian Glee. The scenes where the crew break into song were awkward and who the heck were those 2 random weird bearded guys. Most of the kissing scenes seemed forced also. ""Rhonda"" was by far the most realistic ""kisser"" and better actress. And her singing solo was really good except for Beard 1 and Beard 2. The editing was horrible- random scenes, it was all over the place- and choppy. I didn't hate the movie but....",1363219200,,481,4.4772727272727275

5167165,3,B008I74CFQ,I did have some technical problems. A lot of downloads during the movie. It took me two days to finish it :(,1359417600,,108,3.9545454545454546
5167166,5,B008I74CFQ,"Fun movie, weird singing. If you can look past the part that the music is not very great for a musical it's great. Fun lesbian movie!",1358467200,,133,4.153846153846154
5167167,1,B008I74CFQ,I did not enjoy this movie at all. I did not finish it as it felt boring/slow to me. Not one of my favorite gay flicks at all.,1357171200,,126,3.5357142857142856
5167168,2,B008I74CFQ,"This was an okay movie, the actresses were average, and if they were much more attractive, it would have changed my rating all together.",1356998400,,136,4.708333333333333
5167169,2,B008I74CFQ,"In a nutshell: It's a lesbian movie. There are sex scenes. There are songs. None of it's good though.

I always watch lesbian films with an open mind and low expectations. I wanted to like this, really I did.

My girl and I sat down to watch this and were sorely disappointed and suffered physical discomfort from how unfortunate this movie was.

---Highlights---

The musical numbers go for too long and are very sadly written.

There are 3 sex scenes. The first one is pretty uncomfortable because it isn't key in the plot it seems just thrown in there for the sake of a sex scene. The second was also awkward, but not as bad because it made sense with the story. The last was supposed to be climactic because it's the hero and the love interest getting together but it wasn't that great.

There are some funny moments, though. But the stereotypes are pretty bad and during one of the dance numbers they talk about ""loads"" and it's the last thing I expected in a lesbian film... #justsaying",1353888000,3,992,4.5139664804469275
5167170,1,B008I74CFQ,"I like musicals and I like most movies. Just not when they put random off key songs in. The actual story line was great, but the singing killed it. Without the singing I would have rated a 3.5 easy maybe even a 4.",1353801600,,213,3.9767441860465116
5167171,1,B008I74CFQ,this movie is one of the worst movies I ever saw. too bad I wasted my money and time on a movie that wasn't worth watching it,1353715200,,125,3.6666666666666665
8528448,3,B008I74CFQ,"Fun movie with a few songs, a few love scenes, and a few true moments of the love/hate variety. Enjoyed it.",1469318400,,107,4.142857142857143
8528449,3,B008I74CFQ,"I thought the movie was OK; certainly better than most of the lesbian movies I've seen. The dialogue sometimes didn't make any sense. Probably the musical parts were the best part of the movie, even if they were kind of dumb, they were usually well-done. At least they were cute. I think the message of the movie was that you can still love someone, even if it times you would like to hit them over then head with a baseball bat. Glad I watched it, though. It appeared to end on a happy note. Kinda dumb; kinda cute.",1466121600,,516,4.275510204081633

8528454,1,B008I74CFQ,This movie was terrible should have no stars. Can we say stereotyped dyke characters. God it made all lesbians look like dykes that just sleep with anyone no feeling or thought to it. Not worth the time to watch and it seemed to drag on forever.
