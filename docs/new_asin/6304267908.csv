829968,4,6304267908,"Once i got over the f act that this is not a drama, like a movie about his life, but a dry facts documentary it was okay. But I'd only recommend it for the serious student. Not to detract from his life, which was most noble.",1368489600,,224,3.891304347826087
829969,3,6304267908,"Worthwhile subject, gives great historical context and gives the story in just enough detail.  Background audio (mostly hymns) is too loud and distracting and makes it difficult to hear what is being said, especially since much of it is told with a Germanic accent.",1362268800,2,265,5.0227272727272725
829970,4,6304267908,Really it was written in the bible that it was a torture stake and/or a tree and not ever written that it was a cross. The tale of the cross was presented in the 3rd or 4th century. But then again we can see how the wolves stepped in after the last disciple died and twised God's words to fit in the wolves ways of teaching the bible.,1361145600,,334,3.926470588235294
829971,5,6304267908,I rented this for a plane trip from the mid-west to Nevada.  I found it very interesting.  It is amazing that Hitler had so many unlikely factions united under his ideals.  It sure showed how the elect can be fooled.  We need to be watchful of what could happen again.,1346889600,2,268,4.3
829972,4,6304267908,"Dietrich Bonhoeffer is not very well known outside of Christian circles, but he was a true hero of the resistance to the Third Reich.  His theological work was noteworthy as an early example of today's emphasis on personal faith and the Church community.  The theology is sufficient for knowing of Bonhoeffer, but it is his life that makes it remarkable.  Bonhoeffer lived in the United States for a brief time and became familiar with the traditions of African American Christians. But it is the last part of his life that marks him as a true ""saint"" (in the Protestant sense).  His resistance work under the brutal regime of the Nazis may seem counter-intuitive to some, but his thoughtful reflections on the responsibilities of following Christ are important.  At times this documentary is slow and overly narrated, but I recommend it to anyone who admires Bonhoeffer as well as those who don't know about him, but are interested in resistance to Hitler's regime.

829973,5,6304267908,"This was one one the best documentaries I have seen on Bonhoeffer's life and work.
His life was a GREAT example of true faith and Christianity.",1332028800,,143,4.538461538461538
829974,5,6304267908,"A Twentieth century Christian theologian once asked, ""how then shall we live"". Bonhoeffer's life answers the question.

In the face of moral and social decline and widespread religious hypocrisy he risked all. He denied himself, picked up his cross and followed Christ.

It was at times a lonely and hard path. This documentary follows his path bringing out the pathos, the agony and the joy. The directors cleverly use, photography, film footage and Bonhoeffer's and other's writings to bring to life the path this martyr walked.

May modern Christians learn from his life. May we also, in these immoral and lawless times deny ourselves daily, pick up our cross and follow Christ.",1323561600,5,681,5.0625
829975,5,6304267908,"It was in Bonhoeffer's day and still is.  This documentary chronicles his life history as a Lutheran pastor, mainly highlighting his ideological battle against Nazism and the German church, Catholic and protestant, which became more and more corrupt and apostate under Hitler, his minions, people of counterfeit faith, see II Timothy 3:8.  In 1935, the Confessing Church was formed by famed theologian Karl Barth, Bonhoeffer and others to counter the rising anti-semitism in Germany and the apostasy of the established churches, catholic AND protestant.  Clearly such activities would not go unnoticed by the Nazi's.  Seeing this video directed me to other writings of his as excerpts from his sermons, lectures, and writings are a part of the narration done by Ed Asner.  Bonhoeffer died as a martyr on April 9, two days before the concentration camps were liberated in 1945.  I HIGHLY recommend that this movie be seen.

I'm sure Bonhoeffer must have pondered Ephesians 5:11 in choosing to work outside of mainstream christianity as it existed in Germany-Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even expose them, and Revelation 18:4 says: Come out of her (Babylon/Rome see also Daniel 2) my people, lest you partake of her sins...for her sins have reached to heaven.",1096588800,13,1296,5.172248803827751
829976,4,6304267908,"Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a German theologian who dared to cling to the teachings of Jesus in the context of the Third Reich. He preached and taught in the portion of the Church that went underground rather than bend their knee to Adolph Hitler. Eventually, his sense of ethics drove him to working with a cell of the German resistance, seeking to overthrow Hitler and arrange a peace settlement with the Allies. He also helped a number of Jews get safely into Switzerland, in spite of a Swiss policy against such emmigrations.
Ed Asner's narration is great. Bonhoeffer's story is compellingly told. The issues that challenged him are presented clearly, as are some of his struggles with how to behave ethically and in a Christ-like manner within Hitler's Reich.
Although the movie focuses on Bonhoeffer, it also drives the point home of how readily the established churches compromised and sacrificed the clear teachings of Jesus in order to fit in to the Reich. Seeking the approbation of man (even if of such a horrifying group of men as the Gestapo), most churches abandoned the Gospel in favor of appeasement. While not as pathetic a betrayal of Jesus as, say, the Spanish Inquisition, this certainly was a dark hour for Christianity.
This is a 60 to 90 minute documentary, expanded to a full two hours by padding with hymn fragments and either Nazi footage or modern cinematography of places key to Bonhoeffer's life. ...
Boenhoeffer's theology clearly saw Jesus incarnate in His Church and in the human community. Although many Fundamentalist Christians claim him as their own, he was not. He preached and lived a Spirituality that ventured beyond personal piety and salvation and insisted on a truly Christian Praxis to more fully incarnate Christ in the world of the Church.

829977,5,6304267908,"This documentary informs the viewer in accurate detail of the career of one of this century's real heroes.  Bonhoeffer was a Christian scholar and writer who actively opposed Hitler. Although a Pastor and director of an  undrground seminary, he became a part of the German resistance to the evil  Nazi regime. He unsuccessfully  tried to keep the German chuch from being  turned into a Nazi forum. He actively supported Jews and assisted in  smuggling them out of Germany.  He was eventually arrested by the Gestapo.  His Letters From Prison are among the best literature this century.  He was  a true Christian who willingly died for his faith.  He also serves as an  example of the many Germans who resisted Hitler.",933638400,40,717,4.883333333333334

7866880,5,6304267908,"This is a fine review of an amazing man's life.  It is humbling to follow his unselfish choices and realize that he could have saved himself but was far more interested in standing on the principles of God and attempting to save the church and Germany from the tyranny and Godlessness of Hitler.  Having read the book Bonhoeffer, I liked seeing the actual places where events occurred.  I hope in heaven to meet him some day and tell him of my admiration for his courage and commitment.",1455580800,,486,4.563218390804598
7866881,5,6304267908,"I was torn between four or five stars but based on the concept of giving the audience what they expect, I went five. What mainly stoked my interest is that the historical footage and images are not commonly found. Some of the film (movie) footage is washed out but so what. You will see some number of photos including posters, and motion picture film that you probably have never seen before.

For anyone who attempts to claim that the German churches with few exceptions were not hand-in-glove with the Nazis, this debunks that notion quite well.",1444262400,,548,4.708333333333333

7866884,3,6304267908,"The script of this documentary is really good, but the actors are simply reading lines. They seem to bring very little emotional content into a very emotional time in the history of these people's lives and the musical score sounds very emotionally shallow and misplaced in the context of the history that is being presented.",1390262400,2,325,4.927272727272728
7866885,4,6304267908,"Few people in America know the story of Bonhoeffer.  This two hour segment touches on the highlights of how religion, politics and ethics clashed while much of the world remained blind.  Two hours of narration hits the highlights while missing the ethical details of a small opposition group whose attempts to change the outcome of Hitler's devastating
policies ends with Bonhoeffer giving his life rather than living safely and comfortably in England or America.  The speed of the narrator's presentation is rapid, with many details missing, a normal situation while summarizing a 600+ word book, an exceptional historical novel of Hitler's WW2.  After watching this, many may want and should read the book by Eric Metaxas, to understand more of the times and the sacrifice which definitely makes Bonhoeffer and his co-conspirators martyrs.",1389830400,,841,5.3007518796992485
