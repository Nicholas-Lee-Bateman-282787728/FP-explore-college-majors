I have noted that in the inline information, this dvd is listed as being suitable for Region 1 play in the USA. I would like to know if anyone else has had this problem since I would really like to purchase this dvd as I really like Lucero's singing in a live perfromance.",1332028800,,426,4.083333333333333
8360789,4,B002B8A5HM,"2DVD-Set: Disc 1 with 12 POP songs and Disc 2 with 12 Ranchero and Mariachi. Very Good sound. You can select Stereo or 5.1. The visual quality could be better. The format ist only 4:3.

Performance of Lucero and the Band is great. On the POP-Disc the camera shows only the star. In this case some people might see this positive, because Lucero is irresistible. I liked to see a little bit more from the very good musicians. The stage deco an the lightshow are average. The first part of the concert starts with slow ballads (in nice blue evenig dress) and ends with faster songs (in black outfit). The last song ist a very interesting Version of ""La unica que te entiende"", which is different from the studio recordings.

On the Ranchero part we see Lucero with here white outfit and big sombrero in front of a big Mariachi band and some dancers.

I have seen the POP-Disc 4 times in 4 days. Normaly i would give 5 Stars, but for the bad video quality only 4.",1286409600,,959,4.376404494382022

Lucero tiene un talento envidiable, sigo su trayectoria desde pequea y me identifico muchisimo con la epoca de todas sus canciones.  Este concierto fue fenomenal, demostro el talento que siempre a tenido.",1254096000,,267,5.045454545454546
