8580636,3,B001GHZP88,My boys love all of the Larry Boy adventures especially The League of Incredible Vegetables. I bought this set thinking the other features would also be great and have a good message. They were not at all like Larry Boy usually is.  I didn't like the stories or the missing message.  It isn't even CGI.  would give the second disc 1 star but the first disc I'd give 5 stars so I settled on 3.,1384214400,,392,4.2
