8421016,5,B004AVOIUI,"This is a great series.  I rented the first series from Netflix but they did not have the second or third available so I just had to buy them.  I love how ""real"" the characters are along with how funny and moving the storylines and situations are.  You really feel like you are getting to know them.",1374796800,3,299,4.2105263157894735
