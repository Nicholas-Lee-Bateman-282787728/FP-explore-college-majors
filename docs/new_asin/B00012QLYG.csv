1968618,5,B00012QLYG,"Four true film noir entries from the golden age of film noir.  Film Noir tended to be more of a ""B"" film with dramatic lighting , story and action.  Often the film used odd angles, misrepresentation of size and other tricks to present another reality that was nightmare based.  Wrong place at the wrong time or a bad choice from temptation are two themes seen in these films. We see human weakness and frailty exploited, savage behavior and the application of sex or greed as motivation to new depths of human desire.  The post WWII world saw how underlying everyday life was evil from the highest penthouse to the lowest alley way.

For those of you that don't know, while Casablanca is not truely film noir the excellent films such as the Big Sleep and the Maltese Falcon are Noir but are not as cynical or nightmarish as the later stuff.

Personally I'd give Impact 5 stars, KC Confidential 4 stars, Detour 4 stars and DOA 4 stars.  These are all great to watch for post WWII values, fashion, attitudes and vision.  These were not meant to be expensive films but use ingenuity in making them exciting and worthy of seeing.  It is a fine collection to introduce people to film noir.",1264982400,32,1184,4.547169811320755

1968620,1,B00012QLYG,"duped, but now i know better. please DO NOT buy this collection.  WARNING - this review is based on only watching one of the four DVDs.  we were so traumatized by DOA that watching any more was simply too much to bear. the story in DOA is incoherent and much of the dialogue is unintentionally funny. every time the lead character passed a woman, a whooshing sound occurred, one supposes to be proof of sexual excitement. bizarre - don't waste your money or time.",1207958400,5,463,4.5
1968621,4,B00012QLYG,"""Detour"" is probably the most rugged print, but all are acceptable collector prints of public domain films.  The price is low (check other sites too!), and the set is very nicely packaged.  If Amazon fails to list the 4 films, why give the set a bad rating?

8005799,4,B00012QLYG,"IMAGE QUALITY: Okay. (Note on the D.O.A. print: On the plus side of this copy of D.O.A. is that the film is not cropped. The advantage of this is obvious: Youre seeing the original full image. The disadvantage is that the reason there are cropped versions out there is because the left edge of the print is faded white. Some DVD editions crop this off. Some leave it. The print of D.O.A. in this box set leaves it.) SOUND QUALITY: Fine. FILM COLLECTION: Despite being a low-budget movie, Detour (1945) is one of the best film noirs. It is a great story with great casting and great charactersand it all comes together beautifully. However, the key to appreciating the story, the casting, the acting, and the characters is the unreliable narrator. If you don't have that key, you may find the acting over-the-top, the characters to be cardboard cut-outs, and the story to challenge your suspension of disbelief. Thats how I felt about the film before the riches of the film were unlocked with the key of the unreliable narrator. With that key to the film, I came to estimate it as one of the best film noirs of all time and have since watched it over and over and over again. Vera in particular goes from cardboard character to one of the most fun-to-watch female character in film noir. She doesnt so much speak words as spit venom. To get the key, read Roger Eberts review of Detour. (Heres the specific Ebert quote: Hes pleading his case, complaining that life hasn't given him a fair break. Most critics of Detour have taken Al's story at face value: He was unlucky in love, he lost the good girl and was savaged by the bad girl, he was an innocent bystander who looked guilty even to himself. But the critic Andrew Britton argues a more intriguing theory in Ian Camerons Book of Film Noir. He emphasizes that the narration is addressed directly to us: Were not hearing what happened, but what Al Roberts wants us to believe happened.) And if you really become a true Detour fan, don't just read Eberts review, but read Brittons essay on it in Camerons book. Also, every fan of Detour should read the novel by Martin Goldsmith. It is a delightful read in itself as well as being interesting and illuminating to compare with the film adaptation. The two starsTom Neal and Ann Savageare great together with their characters of self-rationalizing and self-pitying loser and venom-spitting, gutter-born dame. Detour is a 10 out of 10 stars. D.O.A. (1950) is a classic. What a fantastic story. Ever since I first saw this film as a kid, I thought highly of it. I love the way the film plays with the idea of a murdered man seeking out his murderer (like with the doctors line, I don't think you fully understand, Bigelow. Youve been murdered.) You do have to overlook a little cheese. The biggest cheese is the wolf-whistle. But it only happens three times or so and only at one point in the film. I am able to overlook it. The leadRudolph Matis great. This is probably his best film, but he was also good in The Killers, which is another one of the film noir greats. Hes also in the classic western The Wild Bunch. D.O.A. is a 10 out of 10 stars. What makes He Walked by Night (1948) special is it is based on a true story. Its a good film, though it doesnt lend itself to repeat viewings like Detour and D.O.A. He Walked by Night is an 8 out of 10 stars. As for Impact (1949), the story is fairly good but I really don't like Brian Donlevys acting. I think casting him as the lead character wasn't a great decision. Impact is, at best, 7 out of 10 starsbarely.",1521849600,,3560,4.486902927580894

I bought this to watch two of the four movies which I had previously seen.
What' s astounding is that the film DOA is so dark that it just blew my mind.
The DOA disk freezes up and has DEEP scratches.
