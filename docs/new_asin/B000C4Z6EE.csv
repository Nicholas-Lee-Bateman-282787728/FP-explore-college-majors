8095691,4,B000C4Z6EE,Going into this movie don't expect a porn spoof on a horror franchise type thing. Its a fun little venture into low budget films that does horror and xrated content.,1422576000,,165,4.533333333333333
8095692,5,B000C4Z6EE,"I really like this film. Yes, it is a low budget horror/porn film. However, the execution of the story is very well done. I give a lot of the acting credit to Caroline Pierce (an adult film actress) as she is VERY enthusiastic in her portrayal as a horny undead dominatrix.
 I would recommend this film to anyone who likes both horror films and adult movies as this has both. I have not ye seen the other release by this production team: ""Tales From The Carnal Morgue"", but I am sure it is just as interesting as this film.",1262217600,2,523,4.282828282828283
8095693,5,B000C4Z6EE,"I am an unabashed Caroline Pierce fan.  So I will use one friends comments on Slaughter disc.  Succinctly, he prefers horror to be straight horror, and his porn to be porn.  He was disturbed by the commingling of the genre's.  He was repulsed by the film.  I liked it.  A lot.  Course I am a CP fan, but was new to her charms.",1239753600,3,326,4.079365079365079

8095695,1,B000C4Z6EE,"having read, or more accurately skimmed through, the latest issue of rue morgue there was a section, one page, on splatter porn, or whatever it's called.

i almost ALMOST bought this, based on it's low low price, and I am sincerely glad i chose not to, my friend instead picked it up, having wanted to see it for some time.

so, i just watched it no more than 6 hours ago, and i can say, without a doubt, it was one of the most dull, unshocking films i've ever seen.

and apparently it's ""antiporn"".  yeah, this film is antiporn like natural born killers was a statement against the medias obsession with blood and death.

0 stars.",1146441600,2,631,4.405172413793103
8095696,2,B000C4Z6EE,"This movie is an attempt to combine horror and porn.  The movie descriptions given by the editorial reviews does not convey the full extent of the porn.  To be honest I am surprised that this movie is being sold on Amazon.  I was expecting a horror movie that deserved a rating of between R and a soft-core X.  Instead the porn aspect of this movie is as graphic as any hard core XXXX rated porno movie.  The initial porn scene is detailed enough that I could count 3 piercings in the female star's genitalia.  The two oral sex scenes could be nominated as best oral sex scenes at the yearly porno awards. Interestingly enough the porn aspect of the movie is of much better quality than the horror aspect.  Much of the horror aspect of the movie is similar in quality to a ""bad"" Troma movie.

The plot of the movie is essentially that a porn addicted moron orders a porno dvd via the internet. The dvd starts with a Goth type woman doing a strip tease dance and then goes into a graphic scene of the insertion of a demonic looking dildo and female masturbation.  The Goth then says she gets excited over blood and cuts her own throat.  From this point on, the movie just gets weirder.

Am I sorry I bought this movie? Probably yes.

Will I watch this movie again?  Probably Not.  I was hoping for more and better horror.

HOWEVER, this movie was an honest attempt to merge horror and porn beyond the usual horror movie with gratitious nudity.  In the dvd special features, the production company explains that they ran into some major production problems with the horror aspect of the movie.  So I must admit that I am interested in seeing if their next attempt at horror/porn merger is better than this attempt.",1135209600,5,1712,4.470967741935484
