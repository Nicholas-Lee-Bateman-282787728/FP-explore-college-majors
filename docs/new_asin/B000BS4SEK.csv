8091704,3,B000BS4SEK,"This DVD is ""very"" basic. It's not bad but for the cost I feel it should have contained more. There's a fairly large section devoted to the JP8080 which for me was useless since I have the JP8000. Most everything taught on the video I had already known from reading the manual and watching video's from youtube. If the video had only cost less... then it's more worth just having to add to the collection of us devoted JP enthusiasts. But for the cost... it's not really all that much worth it. Once you watch it and know all that it has to say it's just going to sit around and collect dust anyway. The manual that comes with the JP is just as good if not better!",1390867200,,664,4.1953125
8091705,5,B000BS4SEK,"This video goes over the JP-8000 very extensivly, I watched it over and over, and I learned a lot. Now all those buttons and switches makes sense to me and I can run the synth with no problem. This is a must have for any JP-8000 owner.",1269734400,,235,4.0212765957446805
