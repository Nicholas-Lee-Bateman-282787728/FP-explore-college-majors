8622069,1,B00GBT63B4,"The movie begins by showing a group of detectives in front of a mansion.  Apparently a murder has taken place here.  They interview Tony Todd's character who's the guy looking after the mansion.  He can't provide the detectives with anything meaningful.  They interview Tony Todd again.  He thinks it might be ghosts which upsets the detectives.  They suggest Tony start talking and tell them everything he knows.

Tony tells his story.  Four ghost investigators showed up last evening, then another cocky one showed up a little later.  The tall one did some talking into the camera about the mansion.  He mentioned a guy named Jeffrey.  One evening Lady Jericho returned home to find her two precious children had been slaughtered by Jeffrey.  He cut those children open, and in a moment of regret of celebration of what he had just done, he carved off his own face.  And now the faceless ghost of Jeffrey roams the countryside looking for new victims.  The detective think it's a fairy tale.  The tall one was talking while the short one was filming.

Now the story begins.

Tony Todd interrupts the group of ghost investigators standing outside the mansion entrance claiming they're on private property.  They bring along a psychic lady.  Tony wonders if she participates in the dark arts but she says her intentions are good.  The investigators have to stay in the mansion until 6 am and then Tony will let them out.  Their only choice is to follow his rules or get off his land immediately.  He has two rules.  Never trust a beautiful woman and never come back here after dark.  Tony lets them inside and locks the door.  The detectives determine they can't charge Tony with anything so they let him go.  The detectives discuss what would possess someone to butcher a group of people.

The ghost hunting cast now introduce themselves.  The women are more concerned with their good looks and showing off.  The men can't find their equipment and walkie talkies and argue over it.  The one guy accuses the other of being a geek.  When they try to use their phones their batteries die.  The shy psychic woman of the group mentions the ghosts have the power to feed their own, and might've taken over all the power in the mansion.  The woman in charge of the group likes showing off her fake hoity toity demeanor.  She introduces the psychic.  The woman says her viewers like being theatrical which explains why she acts the way she does.  She tells the psychic to be more boisterous for the purpose of TV and insults her.

The psychic says she can hear and feel spirits communicate with her.  She feels the presence of a man.  Her voice changes as she says ""Don't touch me!""  While walking down the dark hallways, the investigators hear a door creep open.  A man from the group intentionally frightens her.  It's the same guy who accused the other guy of losing his equipment.  He gets defensive after the male investigator smacks him in the face and says he's a failed cameraman, and the hoity toity woman is a failed producer.  They don't get many hits a month because they're pathetic.

The detectives mention a man named Rupert who disappeared.  In his office room, the head detective watches a woman and her children use a Ouija board by way of camera footage courtesy of the ghost investigators.  The psychic woman appears and says the ghost is curious why they're on his land.  The word spells ""Death"" on the Ouija board.  A woman screams she saw a shadow of a man looking in. The psychic feels it's a dark spirit and the spirit tells her to leave over and over.

A woman says the spirit's too much of a coward to reveal his real name.  She asks if the man is Lord Jericho or Jeffrey as the Ouija board thingy spins around in a figure eight pattern at fast speed.  The psychic says the devil has arrived.  The hoity toity woman calls out the spirits of Jericho's manner and says she means them no harm during her investigation.  Suddenly she hears a growl.  She tries to leave but the door won't open.  Just then it opens.  The guy of the group and the psychic walk around the dark hallways with their own investigation.  The jerk guy can't escape his room.  He hears children laughing all around.

The psychic says she feels fear in the bedroom.  She hears knocking and asks the ghost to tap the microphone as a way to reveal itself.  She says ghosts do exactly what humans do- whatever is ordered they want to do the exact opposite.  The psychic finds out a ghost named Jonathan is here and he's in danger.  Just then she hears pounding on the door.  It opens but... the footage cuts out.  You see the whole ordeal these ghost investigators had to go through was recorded nice and conveniently by each member of the investigation.  The detectives use the camera footage from the ghost investigation and watch it in their office room.  The head detective loses his mind and flips the tape player and tapes onto the floor when the footage cuts out because he couldn't get a glimpse of the killer.  He walks into his fellow detective workers office and calls all of them amateurs.  The guy getting belittled doesn't know what that was about.  I don't either. It's not his fault the tape cut out when it did.

The hoity toity woman and her male investigation partner have a chat.  She asks if he thinks the psychic girls is pretty but he says no.  This  hoity toity girl wants to know something nobody else knows except for him.  Suddenly a man with a hook walks into the room and tries attacking the both of them.  What a clumsy way for the killer to show up, lol.  He grabs the male investigator by the throat.  He slashes at him but misses.  The male investigator kicks him down and knocks him out.  Wait he's not knocked out!  He still has that hook in his hand.  He uses it to slash the male investigator across the face and dies a moment later.

The hoity toity woman manages to escape but the hook slasher is now after her.  She holds her mouth when he enters her room, trying hard not to scream.  The killer manages to grabs her from behind and kicks the heck out of her.  She tries to run away but she trips and injures her ankle.  She also can't see anything while the killer can.  That's why she looks around when the killer's right behind her.  The killer grabs her hand when she places it on a wall.  She begs ""Please leave me alone!""  He then grabs her throat and strangles her.  She begs to do anything to be saved, but it's too late.  The killer throws her down the stairs.  This is what happens when you're a fake!

The other investigator begins doing an exercise workout of all things while doing her investigation in the bedroom.  Yeah she really believes in ghosts.  She talks into the camera and says it's the best investigation she's ever done.  She tries to get the group together for one last Ouija board investigation but can't find anyone.  She gets angry when nobody reveals themselves and says they'll get it if they don't come out in the count of 5.  She finds her hoity toity friend dead, tries to run away but she trips.

She tries to wiggle the door free but is unable to.  This allows time for the killer to approach her.  In the nick of time she gets the door open and slams it right in the killer's face.  He walks away disappointed, and so he should!  Not holding the door open for someone is disrespectful.  She looks into the camera and apologizes to her mom.  The psychic lady appears and tries to kill her but she pushes her off.  At least I think that's what's going on.  The picture is so dark it's hard to see anything.  She thinks the psychic lady is the killer, but the psychic thinks SHE'S the killer!  The psychic says someone knocked her out and she woke up bound and gagged in the kitchen.  Just then the psychic gets stabbed in the back by the killer.  She pukes up saliva just like the male investigator did.  The killer goes after the other woman, but not before finishing slashing the psychic lady in the chest.

The killer tries to slash the woman but his hook gets stuck in the door allowing the woman to try and grab it.  She's unable to grab it so she runs into another room and hides.  He finds the woman, takes his pointy hook and smacks the flimsy woodwork of the door, breaking it to pieces.  He then slashes the woman to death.  She was a feisty one too!  But wait, the killer keeps her alive!  He says he can't have her ruining his final shot.  She asks to be let go and she won't tell anyone.  The killer says ""Enough of that cliched line!""  She says she's not ready to be filmed but the killer says 'What, I thought you wanted to be a star?  This is the opportunity of a lifetime!""

The killer's tired of people like her getting all the attention and money while he gets nothing.  He's going to kill off each wannabe star one by one.  He takes his mask off revealing... it's the jerk guy from earlier!  I forgot about that guy.  I knew he was a jerk but never guessed he was this bad.  He tells a story about his wife having cancer but couldn't afford a clinic thanks to America.  I agree, America home of ""You need health insurance in case of an emergency or don't bother going to the hospital"".  Great place huh?  Anyway the killer had to watch his darling wife deteriorate.  The killer asks the woman she knows what the main story was on the news the day his wife died?  Somebody was going to sign up for football and get 100 grand a week.

The killer asks the woman if she's ever run into a burning building or faced a gang of drunken thugs on the streets.  The killer says she should be thanking him.  When she sees what the killer does to her, she'll be really famous.  She says he forgot one thing- ""Nobody steals my limelight!""  She then headbutts the guy but... uh oh.  The killer responds by taking his hook and jamming it into her chest.  He says it's okay but it's not.  She's dead now.  He kisses her on the forehead as she struggles to breathe.  Just then the killer appears behind the detective with a knife to his throat while he was busy watching this footage.  He slices the detective's throat.  The killer finds Tony Todd and strangles him from behind.  Haha, yeah right.  Nobody can kill Tony Todd like that.

Wow this movie's really lame.  The characters are mostly forgettable except for the hoity toity lady and of course Tony Todd.  The ghost investigations are bland.  Instead of a ghost doing the killings it's an actual killer which doesn't make sense and really makes the movie a LOT worse.  The entire film being shown through found footage-like picture quality was a bad decision because it makes the film dark and hard to see the actual killings, not to mention makes everything about the movie look really poor.  Bad film.  At least the final 10 minutes is pretty good with the killer tormenting the last lady who's alive, but otherwise skip this.  Tony Todd- why did you sign up for this?",1501891200,,10892,4.451498222447943
8622070,3,B00GBT63B4,"Not bad at all, just got really boring whenever we would switch from the would-be-victims to be detectives investigating the murders and Tony Todd was underused and for some reason spoke with an awful accent.

Personally, love low budget movies and this kept me entertained. Some of the scenes were really well done and there was some tension. The actors were for the most part good at looking scared.",1426118400,,401,4.811594202898551
8622071,5,B00GBT63B4,Awesome movie!  I love Tony Todd.  He's great!  I love this movie!!  One of the most low-budget movies I've ever seen.,1393804800,,118,4.476190476190476
8622072,1,B00GBT63B4,BORING! Tony Todd must of needed some extra cash before taking off from this flick. I would disappear as well. A nut job slays a film crew with a sickle....the police cars look like colorful taxis...a police station that looks like an office from an Allstate insurance building....and actors who are in dire need of lessons. The killer takes off his mask....and....really? Is this worth 1.28 to rent? Maybe. Check out the art work on the disc from Red Box...it looks like a fifth grader made it....STAY AWAY!,1393459200,,508,4.784090909090909
8622073,3,B00GBT63B4,"A crew of ghost hunters are found dead at the haunted Jericho Manor. Ruber (Tony Todd) the caretaker is brought in for questioning. Tony Todd has a great voice for telling a horror tale. Unfortunately when he was done, so was the bulk of his role in the film. We now get to look at the found tapes which included an over abundant of amateur night time green tinted footage. And to top it all off the scare factor wasn't that great.

Three stars based on the strength of Todd's performance. Okay as a found footage rental.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1390608000,,564,4.413461538461538
8622074,1,B00GBT63B4,"Extremely awful horror film about a group of young ghost hunters who spend the night in a supposedly haunted house for a web series and end up dead.  This movie is so poorly made that I was embarrassed for the filmmakers.  The movie opens after the discovery of the bodies and Tony Todd (Candyman) plays the building caretaker who immediately falls under suspicion.  Todd is as hammy as usual but he's by far the most entertaining thing about the movie.  Unfortunately, after the opening scenes he disappears and we're left with a pretty inept shaky-cam horror film.

Naturally the dead ghost hunters were filming the whole time plus they had cameras mounted in each room, so a police detective watches the tapes to figure out what happened.

Despite the premise the movie isn't a real camcorder horror film--the movie constantly cheats, using a moving camera that clearly doesn't belong to any of the characters and also cutting to different angles and rooms even though it all supposedly is on the same tape from the same camera.  What--the victims took the time to edit their footage while they were being killed?

But the filmmakers can't commit to the movie not being a camcorder horror film either, so they shoot close to a third of the movie with the kind of lighting one usually associates with amateur porn films, giving the actors shiny raccoon eyes as they wander through the hallways looking for ghosts.

The police station doesn't look anything like a police station--it looks like someone had access to an insurance office and decided they could pass it off as a police station.  They really, really couldn't.  None of the actors playing the ghost hunters makes much of an impression.  The actors who play the police detectives make an impression only because they are both really awful.  Then there's the twist ending that's completely nonsensical.

This movie is just flat out god-awful and should be avoided unless you want to play Mystery Science 3000 in the comfort of your own home.",1390435200,,2002,4.85
8622075,5,B00GBT63B4,Really enjoyed this low budget horror. Not only does it have the amazing Tony 'Candyman' Todd in it but is also full of creepy moments and jumps. The film is actually well made considering it's limited budget and there is a great twist at the end. Certainly worth a watch.,1389830400,,272,4.46
