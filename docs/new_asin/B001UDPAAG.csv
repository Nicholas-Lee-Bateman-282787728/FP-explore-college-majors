3797692,2,B001UDPAAG,"Between Love and Goodbye starts out sweet and sexy. I thought I was watching a pretty good gay romance. Then something happens. After about the half hour point, the movie changes tone and goes downhill from there. Characters that were nice and sympathetic turn mean and unsympathetic, turning on each other and making the audience hate them. Not to mention the horrible, depressing ending. Thumbs down.",1246752000,3,402,5.106060606060606
3797693,5,B001UDPAAG,"I agree that this film is not a typical feel good movie. But for the people giving it a low rating, I think you missed the point. Life isn't always pretty as it happens, and the way that life happened in this film was pretty real.",1246752000,20,230,4.021739130434782
3797694,2,B001UDPAAG,"Despite the mixed reviews for this movie, I bought it anyway and really regret that I did so. It's not that it is not well made, it is not that it lacks production values or some appealing performances, but the story is so bleak and the ending so awful that it just left me feeling really disappointed. Every stereotype of the ephemerality of gay relationships is on display here and as such it seems to represent a step back to when the appearance of positive gay relationships in movies was a rarity. I'm not suggesting that there is something wrong in representing the negative side of some gay relationships, but potential buyers and reviewers should be aware that this is not only not a positive view of gay love but an essentially jaundiced and negative one. Viewer beware.",1245110400,6,779,4.6521739130434785
3797695,5,B001UDPAAG,"Between Love and Goodbye to me was a well written and touching movie. I won't go into the plot as others have done in their reviews but it does bring alive the difficulties that gay relationships can result in when other people are interfering and jeolousy abounds as happens in this film.
The actors did Casper Andreas proud and I don't like to single any one person out really but Rob Harmon was excellent as the sister come brother of Simon Miller.
Whether an actor is gay or not it is not easy playing gay scenes as they can sometimes come over as very campy.  In this film the love scenes - and there really was not a lot of them - were delicately and artistically done.  One could feel the loneliness and despair of Justin Tenson's character as he was being left out in the cold more and more and Simon's character becoming colder and harder as the movie progressed egged on by Rob Harmon's bitchy and possibly incentuous character.
But the best thing to do is go and see it for yourself as peoples' taste is so different and what I or the others say in these reviews are only our opinions and should only be taken at face value and not as a definate yes or no as to whether the movie is good or bad.",1243728000,6,1206,4.262008733624454
3797696,2,B001UDPAAG,"I watched this movie in its entirety just because I HAD to see how it turned out. I was not disappointed: the ending was as unbelievable and disagreeable as the rest of the film. Films like this give gay cinema a bad name, not to mention gays in general. It is a portrayal of the most  self-centered, thoughtless, hateful group of people, who happen to be gay, you have ever seen on screen or off.

The story centers around a young French gay actor who wants to stay in the US with his lover.  He does so by marrying a lesbian friend, but to no avail.  Their relationship, superficial and trite at best, is poisoned by the interventions of the American's sister, a transsexual who has switched sides surgically and mentally several times too often. He/she can't stand it that his/her brother loves someone else and tries everything to destroy them.

The bulk of the film is devoted to the increasing nastiness of all parties towards one another, and is nothing more than a series of hateful outbursts and recriminations followed by abject apologies. It culminates in what might be a last reconciliation, as the American boy finally realizes the true nature of his sorry sibling and what her machinations have cost him. But fate, alas, is not with him, and everyone loses big time. Especially the viewer.",1243641600,30,1303,4.697368421052632
3797697,2,B001UDPAAG,"It is shameful that the Executive Producer, Mich Lyon, for ""Between Love & Goodbye"" offers his film a 5-star review without identifying his participation.",1241827200,27,154,5.458333333333333
3797698,5,B001UDPAAG,"In many movies - young, hot, handsome and talented - are the basis of the perfect union.  However, in Casper Andreas' third film, Marcel (Justin Tensen) and Kyle (Simon Miller) find themselves on the complicated side of love.  This high drama takes you on the roller coaster ride of a modern gay relationship from hello to goodbye.

The story focuses on the common barriers to a gay relationship, including discriminatory immigration laws, New York City's low income housing crisis and insidious family members (Rob Harmon as April).  Kyle is unable to focus attention on his budding music career, sister, as well as, Marcel.  Marcel, although prepared to deal with immigration and housing issues, is inexperienced at handling the ups, downs, ins and outs of loving another.

This movie is full of energy and the cast, as an ensemble, is good.  The soundtrack is excellent, the direction by Andreas (""A Four Letter Word"") is fine.  The dialog reflects the youth of the characters, barriers between cultures and reflects a time before legal gay marriage.  The unanticipated ending brought a tear to my eye.",1239667200,11,1105,5.027472527472527

3797735,3,B001UDPAAG,"A well acted, though depressing story of a gay love affair that spirals out of control.  No happy ending here.  Along the way, the movie tries to impart a message that one should always be hopeful, but the resulting ugliness between the boyfriends and an intruding sibling destroys any sense of hope.  This story doesn't show the beauty of humanity, but the worst of it.  There is a nasty transsexual sibling that works at every turn to destroy the relationship and although this triangle conflict makes for potent drama, there is no resolve, no winning.  I know life is hard, but this is entertainment and I wish the creators would have found a satisfying way to resolve the conflict.  If you want to be left with a feeling of hopelessness and that love is a fantasy that never works out--this is your movie!",1482278400,,809,4.6223776223776225

3797743,2,B001UDPAAG,"What a terrible movie.  It started out so promising and then just kept getting worse and worse.  Marcel and Kyle are such a sweet and loving couple in the beginning, and so it's really unbelievable and unrealistic that things would change so drastically and quickly between two people who supposedly loved each other so much.  Kyle, who starts out as a cheesy, romantic, sweet, loving boyfriend, suddenly turns into a cold, cruel, jerk, and allows himself to be manipulated by his transgender sibling, April/Cole.  The drastic change in his behavior is so sudden, it made me think that there was something missing from the story line.  Was Kyle on drugs?  That was the only reason I could come up with for the total 180 in his personality. Why did he suddenly get distant, mean, and violent for no apparent reason?  And why did he go from not even wanting to talk to his sister to spending all his time with her and completely shutting out his boyfriend?  It just didn't make a lot of sense.  This is the first movie I've seen where I started off really liking characters, and by the end, hated them.

Marcel's personality change was also a head-scratcher.  In the beginning he comes off as very confident, but respectful, romantic, playful, and loving, and then turns into this pathetic, whiny, clingy, annoying guy.  It's just so bizarre.  The fighting between the couple is really immature and I came close to turning the movie off, but for the fact I really wanted to know how it ended.  I thought for sure the director would have given a cheesy and predictable ending, but it was worse.  He went for the dramatic, tragic, shocking ending.

The acting was okay.  Some scenes were much better acted than others.  I enjoyed the music.  The ending leaves you feeling underwhelmed.  In a scene that probably should have made me feel sad and want to cry, instead, had me laughing and shaking my head at the absurd cliche.  Seriously, I felt like I was watching a copy-cat scene from the movie Cruel Intentions.  I'm just glad I saw this for free on Prime.",1471910400,,2054,4.647222222222222

3797767,4,B001UDPAAG,"Overall worth watching. The movie points out how fragile this relationship was--very new in the making--then with the transsexual sister moving in, more demands and challenges were placed upon it. It is hard enough for a relationship to succeed with just the two, let alone a third party getting in the way. The tragic element was the transsexual sister--without her/him the relationship could have very well withstood the sexual transgressions of the two. The moral of the story is: never let relatives live with you if you are in a newly-formed relationship--get them their own place!",1468108800,4,586,5.114583333333333

3797947,3,B001UDPAAG,"This movie could have gone to 4 or even 4.5 stars but for a couple things. But first the good...Simon Miller as Kyle (I think)  and Justin Tensen as Marcel. Love at first sight and they are so adorable together. There is the good now the bad....along comes Kyle's sister/brother/prostitute (you'll see) April/Cole (you'll see) what a horrible actress/actor (you'll see) Really God awful. Anyway, April is not subtle in her love for her brother, Kyle and dislike for his true love Marcel...she does everything to separate them and well....I just cannot buy that Kyle would not see the manipulation unless he was a moron. The other negative is the ending, what was the ending??? I think I know but I'm not sure. Did I mention that Marcel married a lesbian to remain in this country to be with Kyle? I truly loved Kyle and Marcel and how they loved each other and the idea that it could be so corrupted so easily by such a lousy actress/actor (you'll see) I just don't buy it.",1419033600,3,973,4.56

3797953,5,B001UDPAAG,"I was told about this film by many and how good it was. There are many awful reviews here and I too will go out on a limb to defend this picture, because it is really that good - period. Don't know what other DVD disk might have been replaced in the DVD cases of those who said it was awful, but it certainly wasn't the Casper Andreas film I saw called ""Love and Goodbye"". This film has heart. It also has a pulsating beat and pace that's hard to dismiss. First, I will start with the music, catchy, lovely and fascinating! The groove of the tunes are so catchy I found myself repeating the beginning and watching the videos in the DVD extras over and over. And not only is the music emblematic of the core drama here, but it definitely moves the story along for the mood our protagonists singer is tied into his lyrics, As his life changes so does his music to showcase the love and pitfalls of his feelings throughout. I found that connecting element to be very interesting and integral to the development of the story. Star Simon Miller does an outstanding job carrying the film all the way to its very conflicting end. This is a couple you will want to root for and hope they stay together ""forever"", but at times life kicks in and it leaves you wondering how fleeting the good times can be. My advice after reading all of these reviews, go rent it. Sit down by yourself, turn on your DVD, and immerse yourself in this Casper Andreas narrative, for you will find this film to be mighty and unforgettable.",1376352000,2,1508,4.351063829787234

3797958,4,B001UDPAAG,"If you're looking for a movie that makes you feel good, skip this one.  The drama of just living is vividly displayed on this work.  I would like to have seen a bit more development of the beginning of Kyle and Marcel's relationship because, as a general rule, the relationship of these two young men seems to indicate a much stronger beginning.  That being said, the relationship appeared to be one that had a better than average chance to remain strong until Kyle's sister/brother, April/Cole, waltzed back into his life.  I saw April/Cole as a bitter and psychologically twisted person who couldn't stand to see her brother happy.  This occurs in both straight and gay/lesbian relationships.  I found it difficult to sympathize with Kyle, who should have been mature enough by this time to see what his sister was planning and put a stop to it, but so often a manipulative sibling can control their brother or sister.

I won't say that this is an award winning movie, but it does portray life the way it so often really is. This movie had very few emotional high spots, but the development of the story line was pretty good.  Throughout the film I found myself wanting to slap the sister and send her packing, and then shake Kyle until his little brain rattled.  This was a movie filled with frustration, anger, rage, and finally tragedy.  It does a remarkable job of portraying the darker side of life and how a cunningly manipulative person can created such havoc and unhappiness on those around them.  Watch this movie with an open mind and you can learn a great deal about the pitfalls we must navigate throughout life.",1351900800,2,1626,4.690140845070423

But the edginess of the film and the ""oh, I soooo want this to turn out well even though I know it probably won't"" feeling that grows to a climax is perfectly in tune with LIFE. It is not the FILM which gives gay life a bad name, since the film is merely a reflection of what happens all too often. The dialog isn't the greatest, but is MUCH better than that seen in a lot of the films released since the mid 1990s! I'll probably watch it again . . . in about 7 years.",1303430400,2,629,3.921875

And do not get me started on coming out movies and everyone loves him in the end. This is my favorite gay movie ever made. I like some of the songs on the movie as well.

3797965,1,B001UDPAAG,"Here we go again. Another cliched  gay film , badly written,  corny  and very predictable. The acting was  good at least. We have seen it all before  many times- boy meets boy-they fall in love  then  encounter the usual problems. Story gets confusing towards the end- do they still love each other? You wouldn't know by the  film's confused state of emotions. One minute the hate is intense and a second later at least one character  does not seem to know.",1288051200,,457,4.54320987654321
3797966,5,B001UDPAAG,"In a DVD interview, director Casper Andreas says, ""It is not all good times being in a relationship."" He says he wanted to explore what happens when the passionate love you thought would last forever does not, and the love goes away. I understand his point and, I think I view this film differently than those  reviewers here who clearly hate it. I've often said, ""A relationship is always wonderful until it isn't anymore."" A friend of mine says, ""the opposite of love is not hate. Hate is merely love standing on its head. The opposite of love is indifference."" One thing is certain; lovers Kyle and Marcel (Simon Miller and Justin Tensen) are never indifferent to each other. Andreas captures this complex dynamic, and how we often love and hurt each other simultaneously;  with pinpoint, often heartbreaking, accuracy.
  French Marcel marries his lesbian friend Sarah (Jane Elliott) so he can stay in New York City with Kyle. Marcel and Kyle move in together, while Sarah gets Marcel's old apartment down the hall. This imperfect, but satisfactory, arrangement is thrown off balance by the arrival of Kyle's trangendered sibling April/Cole (Rob Harmon), who comes with endless emotional issues and baggage.
  This independent drama was, astonishingly, shot in seventeen days; primarily in an abandoned New York City apartment building. I think the condition of the apartment building serves as the perfect metaphor for the crumbling relationships within.
Essentially, we watch Kyle and Marcel's relationship disintigrate; which is extremely painful to watch (this may be why many viewers find the film disturbing and even distasteful). Kyle and Marcel are torn apart by forces from within (both admit to one-night stands with strangers) and  from without (April/Cole is an extremely toxic person who exacerbates the vulnerablities in Kyle and Marcel's relationship in order to break them up).
  I know many reviewers hate this film, based on the low ratings, and I am in the minority. I don't believe this movie gives gay cinema or gay characters a bad name. Heterosexuals often display the same behaviors and have the same tragic things happen to them. Think of this as a ""relationship movie."" I can tell you that watching this movie, I felt like some painful wounds inside me were being ripped open.  The whole movie rang sadly true and honest to me. I could not stop crying.  The drama often reaches near operatic heights.  The climax is a disturbing scene of domestic violence; while the conclusion, I think, makes the entire movie a tragedy of Shakespearean porportions.  I highly recommend this adult drama, but not without a box of kleenex.",1263427200,18,2651,5.052752293577981

3797969,5,B001UDPAAG,"I was GLUED to the screen when I saw this film.  I very much identified with it on many levels. Oft times, especially with two men, things can go from extraordinarily loving to completely vicious. This movie portrayed it very, very well. As for the reviewers complaining how the two lead characters changed so dramatically--that is often the way it goes!  HOW MANY TIMES have you said, at the end of a very rocky relationship ""My God...he's like a totally different person!""  or ""I guess I never really knew him...""  This is very well demonstrated in this film.

As far as the evil brother of the American guy--I have experienced that too, and it is very destructive to a relationship, depending on how strong one's boundaries are.

I love this film, because it is realistic. These things happen, and quite often. It may not be a cutesy film like ""Beautiful Things"" but few gay relationships, ESPECIALLY IN BIG CITY'S, are.",1251936000,3,923,4.7375
3797970,2,B001UDPAAG,"As far as gay movies go I have to say I liked the two lead actors. They are cute and were pretty charismatic for a lot of the first half of the movie. But the script is atrocious and the characters get more annoying and ridiculous with every passing minute once the hating starts. I'm sure the transexual brother/sister is everyone's pick for the most controversial character. Personally, I hated he/she and thought his/her blatant relationship sabotage was too over the top.

3797972,3,B001UDPAAG,"I have mixed feelings about this film. When I heard about the film through the gay TV network Logo. I was very interested. A love film about a 20-something gay couple (a wannabe rock star and a wannabe actor) Kyle and Marcel. The movie starts with Marcel marrying Sarah (Kyle and Mercel's lesbian friend) in order for Mercel to stay in the U.S. In the beginning to the middle part of film, they are very happy and their relationship appears to be well put together. Until... Kyle's transgender sister April, (later Cole later in the film) enters the picture. When she arrives at their apartment, she instantly dislikes Mercel with a buring passion. She slowly drips poison throughtout the rest of the film. Dispite her breast implants being rejected by her body and goes back to being a man (Cole), She is still persistant to breaking them up. By the end of the film Mercel is going to be deported by U.S. immigration. When they show Mercel the photos of his relationship with Kyle and Kyle's brother telling him ""it's better this way"" I saw in his face that he finally woke up and smelled the coffee. About everything that happen, that Mercel was right about his brother trying to break them up, he saw the light and came to Mercel's aid only to get hit by a car and get a series blow to the head. Am I surprized by the ending. No. Sadly. Pretty much every gay love film that I ever saw always ends in Tragedy. Overall, this film is just nothing more than just another stereotypic gay love film that doesn't have a Happily Ever After. I can't but wounder if their will ever be a gay love film that is well writen that has a Happily Ever After?... Maybe someday.",1247356800,3,1662,4.452459016393442
3797973,1,B001UDPAAG,"Look, I get that the writer/director/exect producer (Same person I think)  Thinks ""Oh, hey, i'll make a movie showing that life isn't always about happy endings.  Look we get it, Brokeback mountain, The Boys in the Band, Longtime Companion and pretty much any gay film made beore 1995 drilled that into us.  My problem with this film is that the characters become completely different people.  Not just angry or happy versions of who they were, but actually morphed into completely different personality types just to try to fit this plot.

The one boyfriend was sweet, starry eyed, and completely in love with his French boyfriend at the beginning, he says the best part of his day is hearing his boyfriends keys in the door, he completely,hates his sister, said she was poison to his life and a horrible person that he doesn't need to be around.  It is actually the French boyfriend who talks him into giving her a chance, saying that family is important and he should accept her back into his life.  As SOON as the sister walks through the dtore, she practically hisses at the French boyfriend and attacking him, yet the man who is supposedly so in love with the French boyfriend ignores/doesn't notice it, and lets her do it.  In reality, somebody who has cut a family member out of their life for being poisonous would be on the lookout for that type oc behavior, but this guy just sits back and acts like ""Gee, my sister is all rainbows and sunshine, I can't imagine why my boyfriend thinks she is being mean.""  It is totally unbelievable.

Secondly, the French man at the beginning of the film, is good looking completely self secure, etc... yet when his boyfriend starts hanging out with the sister, litterally between one scene and another he becomes this weepy, needy, clingy, crying crazy mess.  Friends of mine and I were looking at each other saying ""Is this the same movie?""  In real life, when a couple isn't getting along it can cause people to be upset and sad or angry.  But again, a person doesn't completely change who they are.

Lastly, the actor playing the transexual sister, is completely not subtle,  again, the character is pratically wearing a villians cape and hissing at people, and yet nobody seems to catch the fact that she is evil and manipulative.  Come on, in ANY gay group of friends the lesbian best friend and their other friends would have called out the sister in a second.  I won't even go into the fact that the sister's history involved being a boy, then a girl, then became a boy again, then a girl again, and lastly was becoming a boy again.

To finish, I got what the film crew was trying to do, I just think that they failed at it.  They wree trying so hard to make some point that they ended up with an irritating, completely unbelievable movie.",1247097600,5,2793,4.594758064516129
