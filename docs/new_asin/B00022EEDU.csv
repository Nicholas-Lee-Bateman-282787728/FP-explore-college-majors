2056229,2,B00022EEDU,"My girlfriend and I were looking forward to seeing this, after what we had read about it - it was on TV, here, and we had also read the comments on Amazon, before seeing it.

After watching about 3/4 of it, we both felt it was getting too sugary and sentimental, and we started to fast forward the video, just to see how it ended.

Some of the acting is good, (not all of it, though), but we both felt that we couldn't take any more of the film, at one point. (We both do like films about relationships, romance, etc., but felt this was a disappointment.) Sorry.",1100649600,3,562,4.194444444444445
2056230,5,B00022EEDU,"The many aspects and emotions of this movie become apparent almost immediately.  The sincerity, warmth, and loyalty that is shared amongst the characters in this film are so strong, that you look  hard to your own relationships to see if you are as lucky.  The story deals with a powerful circumstance, death, and shows you how the bonds that this group has enable them to give the greatest gift of all - love.  They know no bounds when they do everything in their power to grant their beloved friend a last wish. The movie itself is beautifully filmed, with the ocean and surrounding sites playing major roles.",1089936000,7,611,4.682242990654205

2056232,2,B00022EEDU,".. this film failed to touch me.  A bit too 'Hallmark' with orchestral accompaniment to scripted emotional moments.  Well intentioned but trying too hard for this viewer.  I would not recommend this film to others, even though I'm a real fan of Naomi Watts.",1294272000,,257,4.795454545454546
2056233,5,B00022EEDU,"I saw this movie on TV years ago, and I wanted to have it on DVD since then, the edition is wonderful, I loved seeing it again, and the editional features are wonderful, great movie. It's a story about Three couples travel to Rottnest Island near Perth, Western Australia for the weekend.

2056239,5,B00022EEDU,"We loved this touching Movie, filmed on Rottnest Island off Perth, Western Australia. Have searched for many months and were so grateful that Amazon had the DVD. All our friends love it as well. A romantic comedy with a good portion of humour and an uplifting message at the end as Australian singer John Farnham sings ""Lifted up by Angels"". If you don't crack a tear, better check your pulse!

2056240,5,B00022EEDU,"This is movie is on my top ten movies of all time list. This is a movie about true love and friendship and the ability of love to surpass even the largest of barriers.

Everything about the movie from the actors, the words,  to the music, the sounds, the color, and the setting made this movie. It is a packaged set that is so complete...dare I say perfect.

Please take an opportunity to see this movie. When you do you will make it a part of your movie collection.

The Special features on the DVD are fun as well.

Please feel free to e-mail me with specific questions!",1136678400,,572,4.2592592592592595
2056241,4,B00022EEDU,"I did not feel the movie at all sugary and ""sentimental"".  One of the friends reveals she's dying.  If the characters did not express sentiment, they'd be sociopaths.  The movie was slow-paced, but not painfully so, and the scenery was beautiful.  The film contains a wedding to end all weddings, certain to please many people.  My only quibble with the movie is the music played at the wedding.  It needed to be joyful and I'm sure the filmmaker thought this music was, but to me it was determined, abandoned, maybe defiant.  I would have preferred something more emotionally in tune with the rest of the music of the film.  Watching this movie a second time last night, I was reminded of the novel ""Last Things, First Things.""  Both are set largely on a beautiful island, both deal with death, both involve love and relationships, yet both manage to be upbeat with satisfying endings.",1104537600,15,886,4.738562091503268
8020528,5,B00022EEDU,"One of the very best movies in this category.  Great acting, beautiful location, has a not in your face message of hope.  This is light enough to watch and not be bummed but encouraged.",1471046400,,185,4.411764705882353
8020529,3,B00022EEDU,I know someone in this movie and that's why I bought it. But it's not my cup of tea!!!  BUT THAT'S MY LIKES.... You should judge it yourself!!!,1445731200,,143,4.107142857142857
8020530,5,B00022EEDU,I saw this movie years ago I wish I had the dcf but it's too pricey we did the wedding prayer at our wedding,1433980800,,108,3.5416666666666665
8020531,5,B00022EEDU,"I don't remember the circumstances of seeing this movie for the first time, all I remember is that I HAD to have it. The story is a poignant one. One of the six friends reveals that she is dying of cancer. Her only dream is to marry the love of her life before that happens. These friends get together to make it happen. It is a testament that true friends truly are more than friends, they are family. This movie is beautiful and one that leaves you feeling grateful for every moment you have in your life.",1407542400,,507,4.237113402061856
8020532,4,B00022EEDU,Based on a true but sad story located on the beautiful Island of Rottnest just off the Western Australian coast. I really enjoyed it and was glad to be able to get a copy on DVD.,1390608000,2,178,3.9722222222222223
8020533,4,B00022EEDU,"This lovely, moving film is little known, but worth viewing. Unfortunately the US DVD release had an image quality reminiscent of a VHS to DVD transfer. Resolution was poor. Exposures were blown out in bright scenes or too dark in scenes. You even saw horizontal instability as scan lines wavered slightly.

THIS PAL region 2 version is a definite improvement. It has perhaps 25% better visual resolution and more stable image. I think it a nice replacement for the US version. It's still a 1.33 AR transfer and a far cry from a more modern anamorphic transfer, but definitely more watchable than the US version.

It's an unknown film that will probably never get a modern transfer, but this one was worth buying again to get a better transfer.

Be aware that this is a REGION 2 disc and in PAL. Your playback system must be able to support it.",1370649600,,844,4.613333333333333
8020534,5,B00022EEDU,"I love Australian movies.  This is my favorite.  Based on a true story, it's romantic and heartbreaking and fun all at the same time.  If I hadn't been told I wouldn't have recognized Naomi Watts, so she's not distracting at all.  It's a beautiful love story wonderfully told.",1367798400,,276,4.6875
8020535,4,B00022EEDU,"This is a delightful, feel good movie. The scenery is beautiful and a very good advertisement for Rottnest Island in Western Australia where the story is set.

The story line is poignant and demonstrates the value of good friends.",1316217600,4,230,4.897435897435898
8020536,5,B00022EEDU,"I bought this movie for my wife, as a Christmas gift.  She had never seen it.  It's a ""chick flick"" but a really good one.  The whole move is shot on location, just off the Australian coast.  As I said, it is a chick flick, but the storyline is good, the acting more than believable, and just a good movie to sit down and watch.  My wife loved this movie.  Definitely worth the money!",1295136000,2,384,4.121621621621622
8020537,5,B00022EEDU,"This movie, a true story, has been around for some time. Not often we can get a glimmer of Aussie actors doing a fine film. Although there is a sadness to the plot of the story; it is not shown as that, but focuses on what friends will do as they come together to create an exceptional wedding for one of their friends. Well worth buying!",1294876800,,338,4.136363636363637
