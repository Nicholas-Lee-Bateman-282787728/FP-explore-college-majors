2925928,5,B000UVV2CE,This was a refreshing trip to a happier day with the Very Cutiness of miss Day. It was a great love affair for a young boys crush on a Lovely blond lady but didn't know why...LOL..,1225756800,,180,4.027777777777778
2925929,4,B000UVV2CE,"I have purchased all 5 yrs of the Doris Day show. I've watched half of this season and it's a big improvement over the 4th season. The 4th season was terrible and I'm surprised it was renewed for a 5th. Doris seems to have gotten used to the show's format. It changed so many times in it's run. I would recommend buying seasons 2,1,5,3,4 in that order. I never watched this show during it's original run, since I was only a baby. I'm not a big fan of Doris' but this is a good family show, even if it's a little boring sometimes. It's definitly not as good as ""Mary Tyler Moore show"", but maybe as good as ""That girl"". They should have kept Rosie Marie in the cast, she left after season 3 and the supporting players are nothing special in this show. It's definitely all about Doris Day. So if you like her, you should love this show.",1212883200,6,834,4.21875

2925931,5,B000UVV2CE,"The common perception of ""The Doris Day Show"" is that it weakened as it went along, with most writers claiming that Seasons Two and Three are its strongest.  Tom Santopietro is especially harsh toward Season Five in his published analysis of Doris Day's work, describing it as pointless and lame.  (Did he even really watch Season Five, I wonder?  It wasn't on DVD when he wrote his book, his text is short on specifics and never mentions the season's several overt gay references...).  I was also a little skeptical about Season Five after Season Four, which is a pretty shaky ride and probably the weakest year of the series.  Fortunately, the 1972-1973 season is a total delight; it irons out many of Season Four's wrinkles and in my opinion is the most enjoyable of them all.

We're still dealing here with an essentially light, breezy comedy, and this season does not try to change that basic spirit.  But things click in a way they hadn't previously.  One advantage is that the rougher edges of Jackie's and Cy's characters have been smoothed over and their characters fleshed out a bit more.  Jackie is still marginal, but we get a sense of her quirky personality through more dialogue and those hilarious hairdos.  Totally transformed is Cy; whereas in Season Four he was little more than an incompetent boor, in Five he's softened a bit and has a more plausible interaction with Doris Martin.  The two actually exhibit great camaraderie, and while they're no Mary Richards and Lou Grant, they play off of each other well.  Doris clearly finds working with John Dehner a treat and ad libs off of him wittily and often hilariously.

The writing of Season Five is the most consistent of the entire series.  There are no giant clunkers here (like the Orient Express or 'Fat Farm' episodes of Season Four), although some plots work better than others.  The producers have scratched the idea of Doris jetting all over the planet and concentrate instead on her balancing the demands of a high-profile career with a romantic life.  What surprised me was the degree to which this season casts Doris Martin as a progressive, open-minded, Gloria Steinem-esque feminist, how upfront the show is about that, and how provocative it must have been for its time.  Some commentators have criticized the show for presenting Doris with a constantly shifting group of romantic partners; Season Five begins with her old flame Peter but she ends up dating a whole series of men, only to finally become engaged (sort of...) to Jonathan.  What people have missed is that Doris and Peter have an open relationship, something they all but state in the season's first episode, and that Doris's romantic activity is actually quite racy by the standards of the early 70s.  We're a long way from America's eternal virgin here.  Shocking news flash: Doris Martin sleeps around.  There are also several references to Doris's gay neighbors, Lance and Lester, and when we finally meet them they're simply the most flaming, campiest things you have ever seen.  Even Mary Richards's social circles in Minneapolis never went quite that far!  This was 70s San Francisco, after all, and Doris clearly delights in its progressiveness.  One regret is that we don't see more of Doris's neighbors, which in addition to the partying gayboys include a funny Jewish couple and a pair of constantly kissing newlyweds.

It's also apparent that CBS upped the show's budget, since we now have location shots in and around the Today's World building and some terrific new sets.  Doris's wardrobe is, as always, a thing of wonder; she found a 70s aesthetic that works for her and is dressed to the nines in every scene.  This season's fashion show is the longest and most elaborate of any season, with a huge, complex set and a large in-house audience.  This season has its casualties, however: the Palluccis have vanished and Mr Jarvis appears in only three episodes, which are actually among the funniest of the bunch.

Then there's Doris.  She sports her own (real) long hair this season and looks great, although there are also those mandatory shiny synthetic 70s wigs.  In the fashion show she appears in a stunning bikini neglige that fully displays her fantastic, shapely body, at which point your jaw will drop as you realize that this is a woman just short of 50.  Her acting is quite brilliant this season, relaxed and in good spirits, and most importantly perfectly at home with the character and plots.  Her fun is obvious and infectious.  If you don't believe me, compare any episode from this season with one from Seasons Two or Three--the difference in her performance is striking.  This is what the show should have been from the beginning.

My only regret is that it took five seasons to get to this point; had this format been in place from the beginning, `The Doris Day Show' could have been top-notch TV.  In the end, it's variable, but this season presents it at its best.

One final note: this season contains two episodes--the fashion show and and a cute episode involving two of Doris's real-life dogs--for which Doris Day herself recorded voice-overs in 2006.  It's wonderful to hear her discuss these shows, but fans should not expect any great insights from her commentary.  She's in her 80s now and sounds it, and moreover doesn't remember many specifics about the show.  One senses that in the thirty-five years since it went off the air, she's moved on.  But how great that she agreed to be recorded at all!

Buy this now--it's a treat.",1197417600,38,5523,4.824654622741764
2925932,5,B000UVV2CE,"Could not resist buying all the volumes of The Doris Day Show ... takes one back to a time when we cared more about each other ... and we didn't say such things as ... ""that which doesn't kill you, makes you stronger"" ... what a crock! It only numbs you more! Perhaps this is why we buy these old shows and movies ... because there are no Doris Days to guide us anymore, except on these wonderful DVDs.",1196553600,4,402,4.10126582278481
2925933,5,B000UVV2CE,"The Doris Day Show Season 5 is a MUST HAVE for anyone who loves Doris Day! All 5 seasons of the show are fantastic, but in this case, they saved the best for last! Included is a special feature, an option you can play that has Miss Day commenting on her 2 favorite shows from this last season. Miss Day comments on ""Hospital Benefit"", which is her fabulous fashion show! Doris is in her late 40's modeling fabulous clothes and looking like a 20 year old! The second show Doris comments on is ""It's a Dog's Life"". This is such a treasure as she see's her beloved dogs, Biggest and Muffy, who are featured in this show, and speaks of her memories of them! Doris has a new love life with Patrick O'Neal playing Jonathan Rusk, and after reading ""Day at a Time"", you will see that the love scenes are not just acting! Listening to Miss Day's commentaries as she watches her two favorite shows from this last season make this worth buying as it is simply THE BEST!",1196294400,11,958,4.3277777777777775
2925934,5,B000UVV2CE,"In the five years the Doris Day Show was on the air, there were several casting changes as well as storyline.  Doris went from having two kids and a father on a farm to being a chic reporter for Today's World Magazine in the big city.  Each year, regardless of the changes, the Doris Day Show was always consistent in being in the top ten.  However, all of this was done by the sheer genius of the actress herself, who knew instinctively what would work and what would not.  Being the consumate performer, each year Doris would improve the show over the year before...and just when it became perfect, she said, ""no more"" and ended her series.  The Fifth and final season shows Doris at her best, with improvisions on screen that made some of the episodes more than just memorable.
The character actors who co-starred with her were some of the most talented.  John Dehner, who played her boss, easily made his way into the role that once was played by McClean Stevenson.  Billy de Wolfe, always funny, had a knack for making you chuckle every time he was in a scene.
Of course, Doris' love interests were pretty exciting too.
When you purchase Season Five, you remember how good it felt to watch television in the late sixties and early seventies.  You also realize the golden age of television is truly gone from our sight, and probably will never be again.  Take a stroll down memory lane with Doris Day.  You will be glad you spent your time watching a perfectionist at work.  You will enjoy every episode like you did 34 years ago when television was a joy to watch, and people had time for a few laughs along the way.",1195862400,8,1621,4.479591836734694
2925935,5,B000UVV2CE,"The fifth and final season of the hugely popular ""The Doris Day Show"" (1968 - 73) is about to be released on DVD.  Fans of Miss Day and of the genre are eagerly anticipating this release because, judging from the past four seasons, the extras alone make it worth the very reasonable price.  However, the big bonus contained in this season is the active participation of Doris Day herself.  The legendary star provides commentary for a couple of her favorite episodes and that should make this release even more popular than the previous seasons have proven to be.
The fifth season found Miss Day continuing her go-getting role at Today's World, working for Cy Bennett (John Dehner) and aided and abetted by Jackie Parker (Jackie Joseph).
Peter Lawford is still around as Day's love interest, during the early part of the season and even gets to direct an episode(""Debt of Honor"") but mid-way through the season, Patrick O'Neal, Day's co-star in the 1968 comedy, ""Where Were You When the Lights Went Out?"", begins appearing as a new love interest on the sitcom.  Day and O'Neal have sizzling on-screen chemistry and their romance is very believable and their scenes together very natural.
The series has its usual quality production values, almost appearing to be a weekly movie.  The photography by Richard Rawlings is exceptional and Miss Day looks great, wearing some memorable 70's outfits that complement her knockout figure.  In fact during the annual Fashion Show episode, Miss Day models a bikini and shows that her figure could rival that of any so-called glamour girl or pin-up.  An interesting note: All of the background music played during the fashion show is either from a Day film or a Day recording.
The series was known for having great guest stars and this season is no exception. Among those who appear are Billy de Wolfe continuing his amusing portrayal of Mr. Jarvis who now owns the building Day resides in, Julie Adams, Ed Begley, Jr., Roger C. Carmel, Dick Van Patten, Edward Andrews,Andy Griffith, Henry Jones,Lee Meriwether, Bernie Kopell,Sid Melton and Miss Day's beloved dog ""Biggest"".
In the episode entitled, ""The CO-OP"", all the residents of the building Miss Day resides in band together after de Wolfe becomes the building owner.  Among those residents are a gay couple who live above Miss Day, a nod to just how ahead of the time this show could be at times.
The writing is not always consistent but the performers give it their all and then some. Miss Day is always natural, real and a delight to watch. You believe in her and are always rooting for her.
While ""The Doris Day Show"" may not have been an uproarious, side-splitting comedy with cutting edge writing, it was consistently warm, charming, amusing and enjoyable, a great throwback to an era when raunch or smut were not needed to satisfy audiences.
The only regret you'll have after watching the fifth season is the reality that there are no more seasons forthcoming. It's been a lovely stroll down memory lane and a reminder of why Doris Day continues, more than 65 years after her professional debut, to delight audiences.",1194307200,26,3118,4.869811320754717

2925937,4,B000UVV2CE,"The 5th season of Miss Day's TV comedy seems to have more energy than the previous season. The romance plot with Peter Lawford is continued but is not intrusive.

2925944,5,B000UVV2CE,"As a child growing up with tv in the 70's, i had my fill of 'Partridge Family' & 'Brady Bunch' type programming by the time i was able to appreciate Ms. Day's show, which was aired at a time when for me it was bedtime.
Airing on Monday nights i believe after 'Here's Lucy', I remember watching a few episodes before the show vanished, and was never to be seen again for years.
Here, I am reviewing the last set of episodes created, as i own all previous 4 seasons. I was amazed on how the show changed formats virtually every season for the first 3 years before settling on a format that worked for the remaining 2 seasons. I never did care for 'canned' laughter, but i didn't mind it here, as it was, and is, a joy to see one of the worlds most 'appealing' human beings to grace our path with her tv show.
The show boasts many cameo appearances from legends of tv, stage and screen. But she doesn't depend on them to make the show funny. Doris was a natural to acting, and here she is showcased for 5 seasons.
A must have for those who like good, clean comedy.",1247097600,5,1061,4.180487804878049
2925945,5,B000UVV2CE,"I used to watch Doris' show with my Mother back in the 1970's. We LOVED it! And I'm so delighted it is available on DVD, since it never did appear on the nostalgia channels on cable. The picture quality is clear, colorful and bright, much like the lady herself. Doris had been forced to do this series in order to pay off debts incurred by her late husband and his crooked lawyer, but you've never believe it, watching Doris on screen, as funny and endearing as ever. Her show is light and fun, easily suitable for young viewers as well. My favorite episodes are the fashion show ones, because that's a trip down memory lane with all those colorful 1970s fashions. This is the last season she did before calling it quits in Hollywood (aside from a couple of specials) and focusing her attention on animal causes. I'll have to admit that Season 5 is not my favorite season; my faves are Seasons 1,2, and 3. Still, there's enough great stuff in Season 5 to merit buying this--I recommend you buy all 5 seasons.",1242864000,3,1008,4.483695652173913

Season 5 has a little too much romance at times for me personally, but obviously that kind of thing is geared toward the women viewers. Of course her boyfriend has to be a doctor which even in this time period was getting to be a tired cliche, even if he does have long hair and sideburns haha. OK, that gets the negatives out of the way. The best part of course is that Doris is there in all her dazzling stardom and super-charm and that raises everything higher than a lesser star would manage. You just can't ask for better company coming from your TV than Doris Day. Again, I like seasons 2 & 3 best, but even though season 5 is a notch below for me it's still mostly fun to watch.",1397347200,,817,4.049382716049383
