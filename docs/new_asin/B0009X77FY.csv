2332872,4,B0009X77FY,"All About Fast Trains, is a fun look at various trains from early steam engines to some more modern trains.  A large segment does show a large and well-done model village with multiple train types represented that you see in ""real life"" in earlier segments.  Kids will enjoy seeing other kids (and adults) enjoying watching a train pass by.  You learn a bit about the various train gauges.

NOTE: I give this 4 stars overall because the focus in the trains video is not really about ""fast"" trains per se and there is a marching band with a Santa throwing candy at onlookers from the back of a train.  The only thing I can guess is that the producers include footage of the parade etc. to relate the model shown back to ""real"" life???  It is still fun though!

All About Planes is great for the little aviation enthusiasts.  Kids learn various aspects about aviation, airplanes, pilots, etc. via an ABC ""tour.""  A pilot tells kids all about aviation.  There are small planes, large planes, and even a helicopter.  At the end, the ABC items are repeated to enhance some learning.

Overall, these 2 episodes will be fun for young kids with interest in airplanes and trains.",1171929600,,1170,4.599033816425121
2332873,4,B0009X77FY,"NO, there are few fast trains in this, but the slow trains are the more interesting ones visually, anyhow. We LOVE this DVD! My 21 month old son has now requested it 4 times in a row just today, and has requested to watch it everyday at least once for the past week. There's little dialog, which is good for him because he doesn't understand it anyhow. The model train sets are neat, as well. It's not meant to be highly educational, and is perfect for what we wanted; good visual appeal. The airplane side is a bit more educational, but still very visual.

We bought it more for the airplanes, but the trains captured my son's heart most.

This is just a fun visual view of trains and planes, not meant to teach your child all about them, despite the title. Perhaps if the title were different another reviewer wouldn't have taken exception to it. I'm not a big fan of the term ""all about"" in regards to anything, myself.

Maybe all our reviews will help others place if this DVD will be right for their child.",1171324800,3,1011,4.367021276595745
2332874,2,B0009X77FY,"While the video/DVD does focus on trains, they do not show any real FAST TRAINS for more than a couple of minutes.  In fact, the movie shows more of a parade on a model train set than it does any fast trains.  Once again, someone trying to make money off of a title, while showing very little knowledge about trains or railroads.  You get what you pay for!",1167436800,8,356,4.205882352941177
2332875,4,B0009X77FY,"My 18-month-old son just loves the airplane part of this DVD.  It is a great combination of light jazzy music, kid-type fun, and real information about airplanes.  The ""story"" is ""Airplanes A to Z"", and they describe some part of flight for each letter (A is for airplane, B is for biplane, C is for co-pilot...)  It is a great ""documentary"" aimed at young kids.  I think it is especially appealing to my son because it is narrated by a child, and it show kids actually in the airplanes.  There is some nice footage of many kinds of airplanes taking off, flying, and landing, as well as kids sitting in the cockpit of the plane, handling the controls next to the pilot.  Pretty exciting for a young mind to think about doing that!

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the train part.  There is a little bit of that segment that starts to give some real information about trains, and shows some impressive engines and passenger cars.  But then it goes off into looking at a model train set (little plastic things) and a silly plastic figurine parade, with no trains in sight.  Then suddenly, there is Santa throwing toys off the back of a train!  It is pretty weird and not at all of the same caliber as the airplane portion.  If your child is into trains, I would suggest getting something else.  (However, for the price, you probably can't go wrong.)",1164412800,3,1359,4.4534412955465585
2332876,5,B0009X77FY,"My son wants to watch this movie ALL of the time. It's kind of cute, with some catchy, you'll be humming them all day songs! We just ordered all of their other ALL ABOUT movies because we were impressed with this one. And that price for a DVD that my son loves....it's great. You can affod all 4 of them easily! Have fun!",1137456000,13,321,4.111111111111111
2332910,4,B0009X77FY,"My 3 year old has been in love with this DVD for at least a year, he just turned 3. We watch it several times a week. I should say we watch the train segment several times a week, the airplanes video is hard to tolerate for mommy and daddy, haha!

While I agree with others that the production quality isn't great, my kid LOVES it, and dances to the music in it. There is no way this was made in 2005 though, I would say more like late 80s/early 90s from the clothes and hairstyles. And it is quite annoying that Engineer Sam doesn't ever talk, just blows his train whistle. Not sure why he couldn't just talk! Strange.

But if you have a toddler who is into trains, this is a good video!",1349913600,,688,4.088888888888889
2332911,3,B0009X77FY,"Instead of fast trains, this should be called ""Random Train footage we had lying around.""  It doesn't follow the format of the other ""All About __________"" videos.  It seems as if the production company just slapped their brand onto something someone else made years ago.  It doesn't seem to have any fast trains, or educational value.  It does have poor-quality footage of trains, model trains, and a man riding a tiny train around a parking lot while a bunch of people stand by. I suspect that I am a better cinematographer than was used on this film.

So the quality of the production would warrant 1.5 stars, but my three-year-old would want to give it five stars.  He loves it.  He begs to watch it.  He plays with his trains while he watches it.  I do like that it's appropriately paced for a toddler.  It's slower paced with few cuts, so it's not overwhelming.  If you are looking for a video to captivate a toddler while you shower or make dinner, you could do worse.",1348358400,,975,4.514285714285714
2332912,4,B0009X77FY,I have a three year old son who absolutely loves this movie. We had a copy before and he wore it out. It's great fun for him.,1311638400,,125,3.6666666666666665
2332913,4,B0009X77FY,"My son loves this dvd, it was exactly what I was looking for, and it gave me an idea for where to take him. We are taking him to a ""Day with Thomas the train"" in NC",1280102400,,164,3.4594594594594597
2332914,4,B0009X77FY,"Our 15 month old loves the trains section of this video.  The music is awful for adults and some of the video drags in the middle but overall he is hooked on it.  It definately holds his attention.  Not so entertaining for adults, but great for kids.  We haven't even watched the airplane portion of the video.",1232150400,,310,4.385964912280702
2332915,4,B0009X77FY,"Our 2-year-old is obsessed with all things that move - cars, trucks, trains, planes and, of course, anything with a siren. While trying to find videos on these topics, I came across the All About series. Some of the reviews were mixed, but for $5, I figured I couldn't go wrong. This particular video is quickly getting worn out in its first week at the house - mostly because, unlike some of the others in the series, the actual imagery focuses on the trains and airplanes and has less of an ""education"" or talking component than some of the other videos in the series. For our toddler, this video is more age-appropriate with a greater focus on visual stimuli. Here's a quick recap:

PROS
* Lots of train and airplane visuals - for us, the train segment is the clear winner and it's watched over and over and over ...
* Music isn't overbearing
* 30 minutes per segment, perfect for a short attention span

CONS
* The videos are older and the quality isn't superior. But, for a toddler, this is not a huge factor. He doesn't need Speilberg special effects to be entertained.
* For some kids, depending on their age, there may be too much talking/discussion about trains/planes. For our son, the trains segment is perfect, but he gets distracted when watching the planes segment.

Overall, for $5, not bad. Although I think this video series (in general) is more targetted at kids between 4 and 7 years old.",1218240000,3,1407,4.575396825396825
2332916,4,B0009X77FY,"I am a mother of a 3 yo train fanatic and a 2 yo plane afacianodo.  Both love the video, and for the price you can't beat it.  Sure there is better photography and narration out there, but my sons ask for this video as much as their Disney and Thomas videos.  They enjoy the ""reality"" of the video and I would highly recommend it for any child who enjoys trains/planes.",1196640000,2,369,4.169014084507042
2332917,4,B0009X77FY,I thought this was a terrible video.  But what really matters is my kids and they have worn the DVD out.  They love the video and the variety of trains.,1193702400,4,152,4.033333333333333
2332918,3,B0009X77FY,"The DVD should be called ""Something about Trains & Planes"". There are hardly any fast trains in this DVD. This product seems to have been filmed in the early eighties & the only fast train they show is the Amtrak Acela express. The audio is also extremely poor. Extended footage of model trains, a parade in some town, and Santa distributing candies to kids from the back of a train!

Despite all this my son who is 3 loves it! He would give it 10 stars!",1181347200,15,454,4.27906976744186
