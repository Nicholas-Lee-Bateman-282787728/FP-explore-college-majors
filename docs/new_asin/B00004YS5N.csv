7927461,5,B00004YS5N,"As someone who considers myself a scholar on the films of Ed Wood, I found this movie wonderful, enjoyable from start to finish. This movie is a deliberate parody of Wood's films, namely his immortal ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" with touches of ""Bride of the Monster"" and ""Night of the Ghouls"" thrown in. It features several ""Woodian"" touches, including (deliberately) bad acting, an incoherent plotline, and a narrator named ""Crisco"". I strongly recommend it.",1018224000,,457,5.1066666666666665
7927462,5,B00004YS5N,"Ok, I,m George (Jeff) Ormrod and I directed it so of course I think it is the best. So get out there and buy more copies of it!! In fact call your cable company and demand that they show it on pay per view! That's an order or the Zombies in Space Zombie Bingo will get you.....",1002067200,3,277,3.8771929824561404
7927463,5,B00004YS5N,"This one was a daring movie to make. Troma pictures actually decided to re-make/parody the famous Ed Wood movie ""Plan 9 from Outer Space,"" known to most bad movie fans as one of, if not the worst movie ever made. Though the story for ""Space Zombie Bingo"" doesn't exactly coincide with that of ""Plan 9 from Outer Space,"" the similarities are unmistakable to anyone familiar to Ed Wood's famous masterpiece of idiocy. The fact that this movie is made by Troma alone should get any bad movie fan's heart pumping. The fact that it's a re-make of the worst movie ever made is the icing on the cake.",980035200,2,593,4.5
7927464,5,B00004YS5N,"""Space Zombie Bingo"" is a parody of bad science fiction films of the 1950's and hits the mark well. The film moves right along as it spoofs ""Plan Nine From  Outer Space"" et al. The effects and acting are cheap and stupid but never the less funny.  ""Space Zombie Bingo"" is probably one of Troma's best films and is sure to please fans of  sleaze and cheese everywhere.",978307200,2,367,4.367647058823529
