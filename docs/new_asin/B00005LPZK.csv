7944174,5,B00005LPZK,Excellent Flick. brings some closure to the whole series if anyone out there feels they need it.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys Kimagure Orange Road.,1175472000,,157,4.814814814814815
7944175,4,B00005LPZK,"If you have watched all the TV episodes, the other OAVs, and the final movie for KOR (I want to return to that day--the inevitable and heartrendingly beautiful/painful resolution of the love triangle), you very likely have as much love for the series as I do, and can overlook (or embrace) the occasional bits of cheesy silliness that were present in all of KOR except the final movie, instead submersing yourself in the true beauty and sweetness of the series.

This OAV (which is NOT part of a new series. It's called ""new"" to show that it comes AFTER ""I want to return to that day"") has the cheese, and has the sweetness and fun, just like the other OAVs did.

Although I believe this OAV could stand alone, I think it is much better suited to be watched after someone's seen a good portion of the TV episodes, one or two OAVs, and absolutely the Final Movie (which is, IMO, stunningly good.)

This OAV makes a good postscript to the series by showing not only that life and joy and friendship go on, but also showing how they went on in the lives of the characters we've come to love. I'd give it five stars, but not for anyone watching it without having seen the series, so I'm leaving it at four.",1120003200,,1202,4.381165919282512
7944176,3,B00005LPZK,"Given that the original KOR movie ended the series pretty effectively, one would be forgiven for assuming that this followup would be nothing more than a wholly cynical exercise in dead-horse-beating.  And it is, to an extent.  The nominal premise of the film, in which Kyosuke gets displaced in time after being hit by a car, certainly feels forced.  However, as it turns out, the film manages to aquit itself fairly well, and, most importantly, it doesn't compromise the source material.
It's an oddly paced piece of work, to be sure.  The bulk of it works at the probably inevitable task of achieving some sort of reconciliation between Kyosuke and Madoka and Hikaru, and then, this accomplished, it suddenly veers jarringly off into 'Kyosuke really, really wants to get laid.'  This first is done about as gracefully as one could expect; ie, fairly.  It threatens to venture into well-trodden 'allegedly comic misunderstanding' territory at one point, but, surprisingly, it dodges this bullet, for once.  Some may complain that the integrity of the events in the first movie is ruined by mitigating the quite violent breaking off of relations, but I don't really see that...it's only natural that, as time does its wound-healing thing, people should mellow out a bit, and, let's face it, Hikaru was treated pretty shabbily in the original; it seems only fair.  Not that fairness is always warranted, of course, but in this case it's all good.
But then it just gets sort of weird; the material with Kyosuke wanting to have sex with Madoka feels very drawn-out and not a little pointless.  Firstly, I find the idea that they didn't consummate their relationship in the two years between the first film and this one VERY hard to swallow, even if we ARE dealing with Anime Romantic Comedy Land, which is known to be inhabited by the most superhumanly restrained people in the universe.  And secondly...well, so what?  I suppose the creators wanted to finish off the whole enterprise with a bang (okay...poor choice of words), but it's such an inevitable formality that I had difficulty bringing myself to really care.  And don't get me started on Kyosuke's impassioned, if not particularly coherent, little speech before the big moment.  I found the kiss at the end of the TV series to be much more affecting, honestly.
What else to say...for unknown reasons, this film features new character designs.  Less cartoony, perhaps.  This doesn't bother me as much as I thought it would, but I still can't say I see the point, although the more mature-looking Hikaru is well-done, once you get over your double-take the first time you see her.
One thing that I found a bit disappointing was the lack of a number of characters from the show.  Even if they weren't integral to the plot, it would've been nice to at least see them.  I mean, come on, guys, it's not like we're talking great art here; a little pandering to the fans wouldn't kill you.  Komatsu and Hatta make brief cameo appearances (which, let's face it, is really all one needs), but Yusaku--who I was quite curious about--is nowhere to be seen, nor are Kazuya or Akane (okay, so she was a minor character, but I still like her and wish she'd been in more than just a few OVAs), or, puzzlingly Kyoksuke's father.  But the ultimate insult: no Umao and Uskiko!  Come on, guys--get it together here.
I suppose you could watch and more or less understand this film without having seen the earlier material, although I have no idea why you'd want to.  As for established KOR fans...well, what's the point in saying anything?  Obviously, you're going to see it.  And it is unlikely that you'll be particularly disappointed--it's not everything I could have hoped for, but it's not anything I would have dreaded, either.  That's pretty good.",1070582400,3,3792,4.8343653250774
7944177,5,B00005LPZK,"This movie makes a beautiful end to the KOR saga, which is a bit ironic because I got the distinct impression that it was meant to relaunch the series.
It isn't really necessary to have seen the TV series or the OAV's to understand the movie, there is enough background given to give the new viewer an idea of the love triangle that existed in the past, but I do think that some familiarity with the franchise would be helpfull.
KOR, from the series to the movie, has quite a bit of subtle detail, which is why a single error regarding the family name bothered me a little. If you haven't seen the TV series, then you won't notice so I won't say exactly what it is. It's not that important and doesn't detract from the plot of the movie.
I highly recomend this movie to anyone, but be warned, if you're new to KOR it may spark an obsession.",1064275200,,840,4.25625
7944178,4,B00005LPZK,"Wonderful anime, this movie was brought to DVD. Kyosuke was hit by a car when he was 19 and supposedly was brought to the time 3 years after and he must go back if he is to survive. Great plot, but a little too much dialogue.",1048377600,,225,3.9130434782608696
7944179,5,B00005LPZK,I have never seen the series but I still loved this movie. It deals with emotional difficulties very well particularly love triangles. The movie didn't have much action but it was still impossible to stop watching. The ending was perfect they showed exactly the right amount of the main characters first time and didn't exploit it like most shows do. I would recommend this to people who like romance shows but be warned this isn't like any other romance anime I've ever seen. This is not too soppy but more realistic and deals with the important things in life.,1020902400,,562,4.686868686868687
7944180,4,B00005LPZK,"Picking up where the OVA and Movie left off, New KOR has our hero jumping in time. it neatly shows what the future will hold Kyosuke. the character design is not by Akemi which is a bit of a negative, but the story makes up for it. KOR fans should definately pick this up",1011225600,,271,4.037037037037037
7944181,5,B00005LPZK,"This is the second movie from the popular ""Kimagure Orange Road"" series.
""Kimagure Orange Road"" began as a 48-episode TV series which capture the hearts of many anime fans. The show features a family of ESPers: Kyousuke, the main character, his twin sisters and his non-ESPer father. The show revolves around Kyousuke's life at a new highschool and meeting two roughneck gangsters: Hikaru and her best friend (tough fighter and talented musician), Ayukuwa Madoka. Hikaru loves Kyouske who loves Ayukuwa but despite her feelings for Kyousuke, she holds her emotions because of her best friend.
Then came the six OAV's which led to the emotional rollercoaster movie where the love triangle had to come to an end.
The movie picks up years later where an older and buffer Kyousuke is a professional photographer who is nearly killed in Bosnia. Before he is hurt, he manages to warn Kyousuke (a few years younger) that he is going to get a major accident and to be careful. When the two get hurt simultaneously, the younger Kyousuke ends up in the older Kyousuke's timeline with an older Madoka and the return of Hikaru. How will Hikaru feel when she sees Kyousuke again? How will Madoka bring back the Kyousuke of the present? Also, what will be of the relationship between young-adult Kyousuke and Madoka?
For one to truly appreciate this movie, I highly recommend you watch the TV episodes or even the OAV and then the first movie. People just watching this drama may or may not enjoy it if they haven't seen the previous episodes but to truly enjoy this movie, it is recommended that you catch up on the previous episodes.
As for the DVD, I'm disappointed that ADV didn't include any extras. ADV trailers, different language tracks and menu doesn't count. Also, how about showcasing the beautiful art from KOR. They could of included a gallery.
But aside from that, if you want to watch the second movie from a popular anime called ""Kimagure Orange Road"", especially if you seen the previous episodes, this DVD then comes highly recommended!",1002931200,6,2040,4.848137535816619
7944182,5,B00005LPZK,"Kimagure Orange Road - rate one of the best animation.  It has a 48-episodes TV series, 8 OVA and 1 movie (finish the series) that is complete/done during the 80s.  The story is a story about three high-school students caught in a love-triangle, a story that swings between being a light-hearted comedy and a touching bittersweet drama.  It all starts when the Kasuga Kyousuke, whoes family have ESP'ers power, move to a new neighbourhood where falls in love with the local ""tough girl"" Ayukawa Madoka at first sight. Unfortunately, Ayukawa's best childhood friend Hiyama Hikaru takes a liking to Kyousuke, claiming him as her ""darling""! Kyousuke, in his indecisiveness cannot reject Hikaru, and so he tries to pursue ayukawa without hurting Hikaru. Thus, the triangle is created...
The new movie New (or Shin) Kimagure Orange Road take place about 3 years after the first movie, after Kyousuke finally break up with Hikaru (who go to US to study dance after that event) and go out with Ayukawa (It's all happen in the first movie).  When one morning Kyousuke got a telephone call from ""himself"" from the future and warm him about being hit by a car.  Due to the family ESP'er power, ee was sending to the future where everyone all grows up.  During his seach for a way back, he heard the news about the future self being kill in the middle east.  Also, he come across the future Hikaru who come back from America.  What will happen between them?  Is the old feeling still there?  Will the 3 of them go back to the way that they use to be?  What about the Kyousuke ""future"", why is he in Middle east and how he got killed?  It all explains it in the movie.
For those of you didn't see the series and the first movie.  I will say, Watch the series and the movie.  It is the BEST series ever made.  For those of you have knowledge of the KOR, you can notice that this is not the original artist work.  It is actually a work that base on the Shin KOR novel and with the co-op with the original artist.  So you can see the style is different.  Hope you all enjoy it.",1000166400,,2062,4.4388297872340425
7944183,4,B00005LPZK,"For those of you who don't know anything about Kimagure Orange Road, well, don't worry, this movie is still worth watching even if you don't know anything about Mr. Izumi Matsumoto's KOR manga/novels.  The animation is great and although a quite a bit different from the previous Tv-Serie/1st Movie which had the Akemi Takada character designer style its still almost top notch thruout the whole movie. Yep, there are some parts during the footage that could have been made a bit better, with more details maybe but the overall quality is still very very high. I really hope this DVD will have soft subtitles and will be totally unedited/uncensored/uncut to retain the original movie quality, any kind of censorship on Anime/Mangas in general would only be a great disappointment and usually a distortion of the author's point of view...Also buying the original DVD has the advantage to not only have an original version but an high-res one (hoping that they'll use a very good master for this DVD).
What's really great about the KOR story is its feeling, its sincerity and what the main characters and the environment can give you, many true emotions that can't be described by words and you've to watch it--I really hope you will be able to feel the same emotions I felt from this movie and from KOR in general. KOR is not a soap-opera style serie nor is a childish manga but it's alive! Yes, this story and its characters look like true people and you'll love them.",997488000,,1468,4.756862745098039
