7904885,5,B000006QQ3,"John Berendt's 1993 book may not have displayed the finest narrative skills, but it was intriguing nonetheless.

But Clint Eastwood's attempt to film it was a disaster. A competent director, it was apparently just a vanity project for him, and one that missed the sleepy, macabre potential of the material completely --- even the scene for which the title was derived, the voodoo moment in the cemetery, was botched.

On the other hand, this 1997 A&E doc ""Midnight in Savannah"" is everything the movie was not, and in some ways surpasses even the book.

But why isn't it out on DVD?? By 1997, they were already turning everything into DVDs!

Why not this?",1377388800,,655,4.769911504424779
7904886,5,B000006QQ3,Midnight in Savannah fills in all the gaps that may be lacking in the movie.  It details the wide cast of characters involved and describes all the trials.,1368662400,2,155,4.535714285714286
7904887,4,B000006QQ3,"This video delves into the people and the events of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, John Berendt's wildly popular non-fiction novel about the sleepy, isolated city of Savannah, Georgia.  It was great to finally see the video, and found it quite informative and interesting.  Particularly interesting, was the interview with the crime scene photographer, who has with him some of the pictures he took that day--most notably that of Hansford's over the gun he was supposedly going to fire.  The video also does well in documenting the varying opinions of other Savannians towards the whole Midnight phenomena.  Missing from the video, for obvious reasons, is refence to Lee Adler and Luther Driggers.  Also, the video does not go into the issue of race, which Berendt readily discussed in the book.",1102291200,8,805,5.022556390977444

Once you become a part of this documentary, you will understand why tourism has increased here in beautiful Savannah. I would love to see more reviews from those who agree and disagree.",1091059200,3,453,5.305555555555555
7904889,5,B000006QQ3,"Midnight in Savannah is a riveting documentary about John Berendt's popular book ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.""  The central portion of the film deals with Jim Williams and his four murder trials.  There is interesting archival footage from the trials included in the documentary.  But other characters in the book, the ones largely forgotten for the movie, are presented.  Emma Kelly has a nice segment as does Joe Odom, and we get to see the woman behind the character of Mandy.  Luther Driggers, unfortunately, does not appear.  We attend one of the card parties and there are interviews with many of the people of Savannah.
This documentary presents Savannah as a place as well as covering ""The Book.""  The viewer is taken on a short tour of the city and gets an introduction to the beautiful architecture, the squares and the people who populate ""The Book.""  I found it an enjoyable film and highly recommend it.",1020988800,20,929,4.79874213836478
