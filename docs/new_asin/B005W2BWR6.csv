4898140,5,B005W2BWR6,"This anime is very funny, but quite pervy. If that is to your taste is is just plain funny with a capital F. I laughed my butt off during this one. The girl is beautiful but she is afraid to have sex the first time with somebody more experienced because she doesn't want to look inexperienced. So she goes looking for a ""cherry boy"", and decides the funny looking guy must be a virgin, with whom she would feel less self conscious. Once she has decided to lose her virginity with him, they try to get together to accomplish her goal over and over, but it never seems to work out. I about laughed my head off with the revolving bed scene in the love hotel, and several other routines in the series. If you like off color humor okay, this is one of the best I have ever seen.",1324339200,19,773,4.16

Funny, but deals with issues adolescents have to face and which adults are glad they never have to face as new, again.

4898193,4,B005W2BWR6,"There's only one season, which leaves you kinda hanging when it's over. But nonetheless, the show was entertaining and funny. I loved it",1448064000,,136,4.956521739130435
4898194,5,B005W2BWR6,"Yamada's First Time: B Gata H Kei is an anime based on a four-panel manga series by Yoko Sanritells called B Gata H Kei.  Yamada's First Time tells the story of the salacious wishes of a high school girl, whose perceives viriginity as a drawback.  To resolve this, she pledges to have sexual relations with 100 boys in her school, but ends up lusting and pursuing an average virgin boy in her class.

Rather than review this, since reviews are entirely subjective, I've decided to try something new.  Below, you will find simple points that will help you determine whether to watch this series or not.

Fun Factor
Hilarious.

Harem Factor
Low.  Three girls are after one guy.  However, one of them is only doing it to hurt Yamada and gain the love of her brother (yuck).

Sex Factor
Low.  Although the entire series is about Yamada's attempt to have sex, no sex it's actually shown.

Nudity Factor
Medium.  The first 10 episodes feature sporadic nudity; however, nipples and genitalia are not drawn in and are often strategically covered.  This censorship changes in the last 2 episodes, where nipples are openly displayed.

Oddity Factor
High.  It's about a girl whose goal is to sleep with 100 hundred guys, but can barely even manage to kiss one!  Also, there's some incest going on, albeit one-sided.

Gore Factor
Low.  There are some nose bleeds.

Language Factor
High.  Although, there's only about 3 instances of light bad language (no Fs, As, Cs, MFs, Ds, or Ps) , the series is filled with sexual innuendo.

Violence Factor
None.

Verdict
Odd, funny, and crazy.  Yamada's First Time: B Gata H Kei is for those who aren't shy about watching extremely comedic sexuality, set to a decent soundtrack (with one particular track reminiscent of The Devil is a Part-Timer).",1447545600,,1774,4.782178217821782

4898213,2,B005W2BWR6,"This is my 4/10 mangaupdates review for the manga: The anime adapts most of it and goes of script towards the end while skipping some of the trashier parts so you can add 1/10 if you want or not:
The 4-koma format puts a narrative and the comedic timing into way too artificial borders so it shouldn't be uses in a long form tale but this series fails as is it represents 9 full volumes of warmed up nothing. The leads are all just boring tropes as they include a tsundere protagonist, the clumsy but lucky love interest who constantly catches the lead in various stages of undress, the sheltered rich girl as a ""rival"" (who is even in love with her perfect brother), the cooler sibling and... Yamada further constantly monologues how she wants to have sex with at least a 100 boys, can't stop to masturbating at school and so on but then can't even get the one guy into her panties who is heads over heels for her for nearly 3 full years. I can only repeat that it takes the main couple, who are the only characters who get a plot, the entirety of their high school career to actually do something and the manga just ends with a graduation thereafter. What sort of sex focused rom-com would pull such a stunt and all the jokes present are the same ones you will find in all the other equally lame siblings. Look this series may be better than the author's previous trashy hentai but if this can't work as a comedy, romance or a porno then why down it exist again? The award winning and also animated Ping Pong Club (7,5/10), the satirical Jigokuren (8/10) and the out of control The Penisman by Sui ""Tokyo Ghoul"" Ishida (8/10) all prove that japanese sex comedies have no excuses to suck or put you to sleep and if you want to read a highly explicit romance that cares to tell a story thicker then the paper it is printed on then go for Natsu no Zenjitsu (9/10), a 17+ comic by Image or Yanagida-kun to Mizuno-san (6/10) which is a ""real"" tsundere porno. The last one may suffer from the usual hentai problems but it accomplishes WAY more in 1/4 of the page count and i lastly gave up on Yoko's new 4-koma ecchi comedy (how original) after barely 2 chapters.",1429660800,2,2159,4.359801488833747

What makes this one a bit more special is the fact that our protagonist is a female who is looking for her own harem but she may be in over her head.

Although I give her kudos for going after something...or someone she wants, she completely flops on a lot of issues that she, herself didn't even know that she had. I mean how the hell do you do after a guy, get him all worked up in his bedroom and then freak out, run off and leave him when things get heated and intense. She's a riot! Just watch this anime.

4898256,5,B005W2BWR6,"I love this anime. Saw it on Netflix, and immediately knew that I HAD to have it. It basically depicts how 95% of teenage relationships go (for the most part, hehe), so I took a liking to it right away. The comedy is hilarious for both the Japanese and English versions, although I prefer the English. I'm all for supporting my favorite shows (really wish there would've been a second season :s). My only problem is that one of my DVD's came a little bit cracked. Otherwise everything else is great!",1396483200,,499,4.4945054945054945
4898257,5,B005W2BWR6,It is a very entertaining series which is why I bought it! It's funny and soothing for those complexing days.,1394841600,,109,4.5
4898258,5,B005W2BWR6,"Yamada is a romantically naive and sex obsessed high school girl determined to sleep with a hundred guys before college. Intimidated by experienced guys she decides to lose her virginity with another virgin and after running into Takashi at a bookstore she is sure she has found the man for the job. Now if she could only overcome her overwhelming insecurities she might actually achieve her lecherous goal.

Initially disinterested due to the show's premise I decided to give it a chance when I saw it was available on Netflix. While I know men and women that have slept with numerous partners I have never met anyone that had intended or wanted to do so which is why I found the premise a little unbelievable, but after watching a few episodes my opinion changed. The show doesn't focus of Yamada sleeping around with numerous guys instead it focuses on her naivete, insecurities and attempts to lose her virginity.

The animation is top notch, the characters are entertaining, the story is absolutely hilarious and the English dub is excellent! If you dislike crass or crude humor this show is probably not for you, but if you enjoy sex comedies you will most likely love it. This is not to say the show is explicit just the opposite it's the cleanest sex comedy I've ever seen I'm just saying it may not be for everyone!

Be warned this anime contains very suggestive themes and a small amount of fan service so it is not suitable for children! Fan service involves bouncing breasts, skimpy bikinis, revealing clothing, glimpses of panties and brief nudity.",1394236800,,1561,4.774074074074074
4898269,5,B005W2BWR6,"Oh my god. I can't stop laughing. I generally am turned off by fanservice and sleaze but I couldn't stop laughing with this show.

If you want a raunchy comedy and know what you're getting into, this show is excellent. Sort of like American Pie from a Japanese girl's perspective. Go into it with that mentality and you won't be disappointed.",1393372800,,342,4.60655737704918
4898270,2,B005W2BWR6,I did not realize the sex content in this film would be embarrassing for me to watch...  I do not go for sex just for happy movies with friendship and kindness to all!  Not my cup of tea!  Sadly hoping for a better movie?,1391644800,,221,3.977272727272727

4898272,5,B005W2BWR6,"This story really surprised me as far as how great it was.  First off for those people into fan service it's got that.  But don't pick this title for that alone.  This was a really fun and sexy series about a couple of teens and the misadventures we all get into trying to have our first experiences.  Yamada wants to have sex with 100 boys but (as the saying goes) a journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.  It's that first step she's having so hard a time getting past.

I can't remember the last time I laughed so much with an anime series but that's what I found myself doing.  More over I found myself relating to the confusing thoughts, missed signals and flat out embarrassing moments that encompass our teen years.  Definitely a good buy for any anime fan.",1389571200,,779,4.361111111111111

4898275,5,B005W2BWR6,"This is an amazing anime! It really does not suffer from the follies of many ecchi type shows like So I can't play H, High School of The Dead, and others like that. The story line is enthralling, despite being about a girl who wants to nail a hundred dudes. The voice acting is stupendous! The comedy and jokes, even the sex-based ones, are incredibly original and clever! The characters are great and none of them are particularly annoying as s***. I highly recommend this overlooked masterpiece!",1388188800,,497,4.724137931034483
4898276,5,B005W2BWR6,"I loved this anime and never stopped laughing from episode one.  Yamada has some wild thoughts and so does her friends.

4898277,4,B005W2BWR6,"Absolutely funny, reminds me of a anime version of American Pie. I enjoyed this series and would recommend for some romance and a good laugh.",1387497600,,141,4.68
4898278,5,B005W2BWR6,"At first I must admit I wasn't sure about this series, but after seeing it on Netflix I decided to at least give it a try. I'm so glad I did, from the very first episode it sucked me in and I could not stop laughing.

The story is about a young girl named Yamada  and as you can get from the title, it revolves around her getting her first sexual encounter. What's funny is firstly how determined she is, which is in itself interesting since in many animes its the boy who's the pervert,  and secondly how badly she fails in her attempt.

Her main target Kosuda  is extremely likeable, and in fact I'd say relatable to a point. I mean I'm sure most good guys with a Yamada thrust on them would be as confused as that poor man is. I just couldn't help feeling sorry and laughing at his bad/good luck. The side characters are also rather enjoyable, overall it's just a great cast.

On the fan service, personally for me for it being about a girl trying to lose her cherry, there wasn't a whole lot there compared to some other animes. But there obviously are some, mainly being the usual  panties shots and Yamada showing off her cleavage (for the most part while there in her bra).

Just overall I found this one to be extremely adorable and funny, I can't wait to add it to my collection. And I'm sure you'll say the same thing when you watch it.",1382832000,,1346,4.250980392156863

4898290,5,B005W2BWR6,"I expected a lot of dirty fan service but thankfully was surprised. This show was all about relationships not just sex. Yes, sex is the main topic but you learn that Yamada is all talk. She doesn't know how to properly broach the subject. I highly recommend giving this show a chance. It is hilarious.",1380412800,8,301,4.490909090909091

I watched the entire series... and i wound up buying the box set lol. This series I think explains what a lot of people have going though their mind in high school, and trust me plenty of laughs along the way and of course some romance as well. I can say i feel i spent my money very well.",1377907200,3,496,3.872549019607843

4898294,5,B005W2BWR6,"I love this anime so much! And I heard that on dvd it's uncensored, which will make it even better. I'll have to explainn to my mom though if she sees the title of it that this anime isn't pornography lol... It's not the first title I've had to explain (Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt... Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl... Gakuen Heaven because it had ""Boys Love Hyper"" under the title...)

Luckily, animes have the rating somewhere on them, so if she doesn't believe me, I can just show her the rating. Animes like this usually have 16+ on them, so she'll be a little more relieved at that. I'm eighteen thoguh so i could have an anime that goes farther than this if I want (I own WAY ecchier animes like Seikon no Qwaser and Kanokon for peat sake...)

Anyway it take place when the students are in high school pretty much 80% of all anime. Begin with a Freshman female with no description of her first name the show and the manga doesn't say, so she goes by Yamada. And all the people are staring at her for beauty and she meet a plain guy name Kosuda that get her intention because she think he a virgin and he is. Anyway Yamada life time goal is to have sex 100 dudes no females. Yet she has no experience in having sex or having boyfriend. In addition, she has weird thing down in her pussy.

Problem is she's a virgin and actually shy.  She's shallow, vain, and more than proud of being the 'coolest girl in school'.  But she's also shy, kind, insecure, making her a very funny combination.  She could easily have become the stereotype 'mean girl' from high school, but lacks the cruelty.  Her sexual 'aggression' towards her target (an extremely nice and *very* clueless young male virgin) always ends up fizzling out into shy, awkwardness.  What could be sleezy becomes funny, sweet, and likeable.  While not for all tastes, it's funny and has enough charm to make it easy to watch.",1368230400,,756,4.753846153846154

For those who are hesitant, it does have a plot and the characters have more lines than sex. Moreover, there isn't no sex scenes at all, just suggestions.

Yamada, the lead character is motivated by a highly unrealistic dream of sleeping with 100 guys in high school. However, bedding the very first one proves to be a nearly impossible task. There's more talk of sex and panty shots than any actual copulation. Being only 15 years old, Yamada's inexperience, clumsiness and self-doubt undercut her at every turn. Luckily for her, her first target is a geneuinely nice boy. She falls for him without intending to, so the series is oddly chaste in many ways. The humor is pretty good, if a bit low-brow, manic and slapstick. Yamada is pretty, but self-involved, neurotic and clueless. This could be irritating, but Yamada still manages to be a likable character. The animation is well done for anime and fun to watch.

I personally found this anime very enjoyable due to the main protagonist Yamada. Shes pervy yes, or at least acts the part. But when it comes to actual scenarios shes gets put into her true demeanor shows. I think the true Yamada shines when she gets shy or nervous, it shows the true her. On the outside she can seem bitchy and conceded, but that's not the real her. I guess what drew me in was how innocent she was deep down, while at a first glance you would assume the exact opposite.",1351728000,,604,4.252173913043478

After numerous attempts and failures Yamada and Kosuda develop feelings for each other. So much for banging 100 dudes. There's only 1 for her.

This anime is really funny. Yamada is a hilarious character, and Kosuda is a genuine nice guy that you just have to root for.

The boy she selects to be her first time, hence the us releases title, is your average joe.  Picked because she thinks he'd be an easy target, he ends up being quite the charmer, if dense as a rock.  Basically a perfect fit for our dense heroine.

What follows is a rather cute show, about the transition from lust to love, with some great characters, crisp art, and a good sound mix.  Listened mainly to the subtitled version, and the subs appear to match more or less, although a few liberties were taken here and there.

I will say that many dubbed films seem to loose the original tone of the characters and I normally prefer to watch in Japanese, but this is definitely one of the exceptions.  I find that the English voice actors do a wonderful job and the English scripting is great.  There are many laugh out loud scenes and I the amount of fan service seems very appropriate for the story, with mostly some panty shots - which actually are funny - and only a slight bit of nudity at the end.

I give this a strong buy recommendation for those that are looking for a sexy comedy that has some heart.  Fan service is medium and does not overshadow the story.

The only real item that I could not stand was the actor commentary, which seemed more like just the people hanging out and telling stories, instead of commenting on the episode that they were ""watching"".",1339977600,,970,4.514285714285714

I can't say I have any issues with the audio.  My one big complaint is the crummy subtitles!  The text could stand to be a little larger, but that isn't my main issue with them.  The main issue I have with them is that they are solid white.  I never had much trouble reading these subtitles while watching FMA: BH, but there are a lot of scenes with lighter colors that make reading most difficult in this release.  Seriously, I don't think it's asking much for some nice, quality subtitles...

4898418,5,B005W2BWR6,"Pros:
great story, great humor, brilliant characters, and amazing images (you'll see what i mean)

Cons:
it only lasts 12 eps.

Other Thoughts:
the story for this anime is fairly straight forward.
yamada a girl who for reasons of her own wants to have 100 sex friends, but is too scared to go with someone who has experience so wants to start with as she puts it a ""cherry boy"".
enter kosuda a vary plain boy who sits next to her in school and fulfills her requirements.
the only problem is yamada gets so caught up in her fantasies that she goes overboard by doing things like ripping kosuda into an empty room and flash her bra then in a state of panic run away, she also has spent so much of her time thinking about sex that she doesn't recognize love when its staring her right in the face and doesnt know what to do or how to express her feelings beyond being a little tsundere.
this is a must see anime that is funny beyond belief, and has some of the greatest background visuals you will ever see.
my personal fave is the one with yamada as the wolf and kosuda as little red riding hood (watch it and see).
and same as some of their previous releases that i have reviewed on this site this funimation release has blu-rays that work in the u.k market or at least they work in my ps3.
Would you recommend this title: Yes",1333584000,,1325,4.253968253968254

This show contains much sexual tension, however it is NOT PORN. There is nudity, and even some nipplage towards the end, but it's not a smutty show, in fact there is a romantic undertone through the whole thing, but the comedy takes priority. It had me and my friends laughing out loud!

It's also nice to see a female take charge of her own sexuality, Yamada's not just some pathetic plaything waiting to be conquered(she's the one who will be doing the conquering!).

Newcomer Scott Freeman and seasoned veteran Brittney Karbowski take the lead in this show as Kosuda and Yamada(respectively), they do a fantastic job and I would like to see more of Scott Freeman in the future because he really killed it in this anime.

I bought this show on a whim because it was on sale(I believe it still is), and I haven't regretted it whatsoever! It's a hilarious show and I highly recommend it! Especially to those with a crude sense of humor!

**Spoilers**  **If you haven't seen the show yet, you may want to skip the 2nd paragraph!**

Its the same thing over and over again...  the guy and the girl have a lot chances together, but neither of them can ever express the way they feel and they manage to blow every single opportunity they have.  And whenever Kosuda finally gets the courage to express anything to Yamada, she screams at him or flips out.  I guess this is suppose to be part of the humor of the show, the fact that they never actually accomplish anything, but for me its actually frustrating.  Towards the end of the series, they get close to accomplishing their goal many times, but in the end... it never happens!!  Very close but no cigar!  I can't believe the show ended like that.  I actually went online to check for a second season but it seems this is it.  Not that I would wanna go through another full season of watching these two try to have sex!  I guess I would have been more satisfied if he banged the hell outta her, but hey, this isn't hentai or anything.

**spoilers over**

All in all, its still entertaining.  So I still gave it 4 stars.  The show is very sexual in nature but at the same time nothing too graphic.  At the end of the series you see Yamada's breasts but thats about it.  This show does make me think back old middle school and high school days.  The days of innocence and inexperience with the opposite sex.  Awkward and funny stuff.  Its a short 12-episode series so I think its worth checking out if the premise sounds interesting to you...

4898422,4,B005W2BWR6,"Unlike some comedies with sexual situations, this show is not trying to tell a another type of story with that element added in. The only story being told here is about two virgins, Yamada & Kosuda trying to figure out how to overcome their awkwardness & do the deed. It has been many years for me since going through those feelings, and this show was not only hilarious, but made me feel nostalgic for that time in my youth. The fact that Yamada has some pretty wild ideas like wanting 100 sex partners until she is faced with reality of her real emotions is also a funny lookback at youthful naivete to me as well. But I don't want to sound too serious about that nostalgic stuff, because this show is just flat out funny and lighthearted all the way through. I would relate a comedy like this to American live action movies like Porky's or American Pie as far as content. R rated & a little raunchy, but that's as far as it goes.",1331856000,,932,4.331428571428572

4898435,4,B005W2BWR6,"Stop me if you've heard this one before, anime fans. A nerdy guy is a giant pervert, and goes to a school filled with voluptuous young ladies. His eventual goal is to get in close with them and score, but he ends up falling for the childhood friend/nerdy one/headstrong one. It's a formula that's been used time and time again, and for some reason, a lot of people seem to not get sick of it one bit. To put it lightly, I am not one of those people. But by taking the formula and replacing that guy with a cute girl, and adding in an extra bit of teen pathos, ""B Gata H Kei"" rises above the rest to a series that's hard not to recommend.

Yamada is perhaps more perverted than even the boys in her school. Her life goal is to bed 100 guys before graduating high school, and with a whole wave of them wanting to get with her, one would figure that it wouldn't be that hard. But one would be mistaken, because the poor girl is clueless when it comes to seducing men, on account of the fact that actually having sex outside the context of romance makes her nervous to the point of blushing intensely. And so it ends up that her first ""victim"", an average Joe by the name of Kosuda, becomes somewhat of a love interest throughout the whole series. Yamada attempts to fornicate with him time and time again, but it always fails on account of her being too darn bashful for her own good.

This seems like a set-up for a nonstop barrage of fan service, but what sets this show apart from the rest is how little of it there actually is. Panty shots are generally obscured, there's never any tasteless nudity, and the outfits the female characters are garbed in are far more modest those found in other series cut from similar cloths. No, ""B Gata H Kei"" is taste in it's visual content, which makes for an overall more enjoyable series to watch.

All of the raciness had to go somewhere, of course, and that's where the completely R-rated dialogue comes in. People sensitive to explicit references to genitalia, consistent use of profanity, and a general mood of raunchiness should probably not watch this, if they were planning to anyway. Yamada is a walking encyclopedia of debauchery, possessing a vast knowledge of everything sexual except for how to actually engage in intercourse. The same can be said of her rival, Kanejo, who has a fake elegant front for her bizarre sexual interest in one of her close family members. The writers frequently make light of sex, incest and prurient interests, playing it off casually much like a Kevin Smith movie.

Kevin Smith is perhaps the best comparison to this series for another reason as well. That's because underneath all of the riotous comedy and awkward shenanigans, this is really a human story. It's the classic ""girl-loves-boy"" story for my generation of youth, the generation who are glued to their computers, always connected, and spew off sexual dialogue like it's not offensive one bit. Personally, I relate to Yamada a good bit. Despite her grand ambitions (however ignoble they may be), she realizes that underneath her posturing, she's a normal girl who is susceptible to things such as hurt feelings and falling in love. There's a great deal of weakness inside of her, which makes her a far more compelling protagonist than ones from other erotic comedies. Her interactions with other characters often times feel, much like conversations I would have with friends. It really succeeds at painting a believable picture of today's teenagers.

Also aiding the story are the side characters, who all serve a purpose. My personal favorite is Yamada's best friend Miharu, who acts as a sort of foil to her pal's daily antics and varying fits of sexual frustration and romantic confusion. She's one of the most tolerant and believable best friends I've personally ever seen in an anime. Also enjoyable is aforementioned love interest Kosuda, who is so painfully ordinary that it's funny. Everything from his face to his mannerisms are unforgettably vanilla, which ironically makes him very memorable. Other characters, like ""rivals"" Kanejo and Mayu, are all given their moments to shine, making for an inordinately balanced comedy.

It would be a crime not to mention, however, that the two funniest side characters are actually inside Kosuda and Yamada themselves. Both of them possess an ""Eros Deity"", i.e. their secretly perverted consciousnesses. Yamada's is a chibi version of her, only with a giant grey mustache slapped on her face. She rides around on a little cloud and constantly yells at Yamada to be more aggressive, and frequently serves as a narrator. Kosuda's is also a chibi version of himself, but with perpetually closed eyes, that typically remains quiet but often serves as a metaphor for the poor boy getting an erection around Yamada. He even substitutes for Kosuda's actual genitalia at one point in the series, so that while Yamada sees his beans and franks, the viewer sees a little man on his crotch. The placement of these deities is always hilarious, and just another quirk that makes this series so good.

On the technical side of things, ""B Gata H Kei"" isn't go to win any awards, but it's certainly not lackluster. The animation is very crisp, frequently shifting according to the narrative situation. There's never a noticeable dip in budget, making it consistently pleasant to look at throughout the entirety of the series. It also helps that the designs for all of the characters look incredibly attractive, even for the boys. There's some serious animated eye candy on display here, for those who care.

What really won me over, though, was the music and voice acting. The opening and ending ditties are dangerously infectious, but nowhere near as much as the song ""B Gata H Kei"" that appears about three-quarters of the way through the show, which will be lodged in your cranium for months. The voice acting is also top-notch, with Yamada's voice actress shining above everybody else in both versions. Both Yukari Tamura and Brittney Karbowski bring something unique to the table with the character; Tamura emphasizes Yamada's innocent and demure interior, while Karbowski plays up the debauched side for the big laughs. Both versions work incredibly well, and the same can be said for the rest of both the English and Japanese casts.

When it was released, many critics seemed to hate ""B Gata H Kei"", but average viewers adored it. Being one of those viewers, it's been interesting to see the critical opinion change somewhat over the course of almost two years. Well, interesting and gratifying, because ""B Gata H Kei"" is truly a good series, deserving of every bit of praise it gets. It succeeds as both a social satire of today's youth and a ribald sex comedy, with both sides getting equal treatment. Even with FUNimation's ludicrous price (which seems to be the norm for them nowadays), this is one series that is worth splurging on if you know what you're getting into. Not only a great comedy, but a great overall show.

4898437,4,B005W2BWR6,"I can't add to any of the 5-star reviews in this thread.  They pretty much say it all, and for all the right reasons.  This a really fun anime to watch.

My only con is the subtitles.  One of the other favorable reviews noted that sometimes the subtitles were difficult to see because they were white on a light colored background.  The reviewer found them legible otherwise.

Unfortunately, I had to struggle with the ""otherwise"" scenes too.  The font size was too small, the outlines too thin, and the color completely wrong for many of the backgrounds.

I'm one of those eccentrics who likes to watch these anime programs in Japanese with English subtitles.  I just enjoy Japanese voice acting more than English dubbing.  For this reason I've seen many anime with Japanese audio and subtitle tracks selected.  To my eyes, the best combination of properties for subtitles has been:

font size: at least 12pts, as viewed on a 40-inch LCD TV from a distance of about 8 ft.
font: arial bold or arial black, or any sans-serif font in bold
color: yellow
outline: black, thick enough to be easily seen on as many different colored backgrounds as possible.  This property is a little tough to quantify.  Decent quality assurance would have to verify what works best on a frame-by-frame basis.

I don't know why, but yellow subtitles have worked the best against most colored backgrounds - even yellow, provided the letters are outlined in black.  White letters with black outlines, on the other hand, are difficult if not impossible to see on many light-colored backgrounds.

In fact, I give Yamada's subtitling ZERO STARS.  I've never seen subtitles this poorly done.  However, the program itself was so well done that I had to boost the average rating from 2-1/2 to 4 stars.

Also, I'm sure different viewers will have different experiences with those subtitles, and that their experiences will be 5-star.

But if you're like me (whether or not you write in sentence fragments) as far as enjoying Japanese voice acting goes, you may have to watch parts or all of some episodes with the English dub turned on. Fortunately this is one of those productions that floats the disc menu above the program in progress, so you can easily change the language setup in real-time.  That's another good reason to boost the average from 2-1/2 to 4 stars in spite of the terrible subtitles.

Bottom line: Yamada's First Time is one of the best anime I've ever seen, and in one respect one of the worst, all in one package.  It was well worth watching for those ""best"" parts.

4898438,4,B005W2BWR6,"I liked this series, I gave it a very respectable 4 on the overall rating.
To break it down though:
Comedy: 5
Drama: 3
Story: 3.5
Fan service: 4
Character developement: 3
""H/ecchi/pervertedness"" factor: off the charts...

But, this isn't your typical ""ecchi"" anime. Which are usually 'harem' types, with 1 guy being the protagonist and having multiple girls chasing after him.
This series gives you the perspective of a female protagonist, who's main goal is to lose her virginity and thus become more 'experienced'... At least that's what she keeps telling herself. And thus, chaos ensues. It's actually a pretty nice story but not one for the family, or anyone really under 15-ish for that matter.

I was really intrigued by how perverted a mind this character has. I would definitely ""NOT"" use this anime as an introduction to anime for anyone....""ESPECIALLY"" if that someone is a girlfriend. She'll just be creeped out by the whole thing, even though parts of it could coincide with the way she probably thought when she was that age. But, you and her both know she'll never admit to. Even if that someone is a guy friend, I wouldn't recommend it if they're not already totally into anime. A show like this might set their expectations for other anime a little too high on the ""H"" scale.

If you want to start someone out on a good comedy romantic anime I'd probably go for something like http://www.amazon.com/Ranma-Season-Digital-Dojo-Anime/dp/B000JVT28G , as long as they keep in mind how long ago that anime was actually made. If you really want to get a gf hooked on anime though I'd probably go for something like http://www.amazon.com/KANON-COMPLETE-BOX-SET-Movie/dp/B0030ZOYPO , http://www.amazon.com/School-Rumble-First-Semester-S-A-V-E/dp/B002FOQXRI , or http://www.amazon.com/Clannad-Collection-Artist-Not-Provided/dp/B003E51VUQ .

First for the type of adult humor it turns out to be a cute show that really drew me in well.  B Gata H Kei is probably not for the young boy or girl unless you want them running around learning a few new terms and adult type things but other than that for being full of adult comedy there is not tons of nudity but enough to put some extra feel into the plot.

4898442,4,B005W2BWR6,"This is actually a pretty funny anime with a sexy, naughty side to it. The story revolves around a 15 year old high school student and her quest to achieve sexual relations with 100 different people. However, her insecurities as a virgin, causes her to reject everyones who's asked her out and to search for someone, who's also a virgin, to bestow her first time to. The story revolves around Yamada and her quest to seduce Kosuda while along the way also finding her true love. This is the basic premise for this 12 episodes series. What makes this series funny, to me, are the inner feelings of Yamada and some of her friends. There's a lot of fan service but with no real nudity until the last episode which has two scenes, one in the first half and one in the second. I watched all episodes in Japanese with English subs but did try the English dub for about 10 minutes. They weren't bad but I just found the Japanese ones to be funnier. There were a scene or two that I had trouble reading the subs as they were white layered on top of a light background. Other than this, they were easily legible. I also watched both blu ray and DVD to see the differnce in the two. The blu rays were formatted to fit my TV nicely while the DVDs were shown in widescreen. As far as quality goes, there's no comparison. If you have a blu ray player, watch the blu ray. My only complaint would be I wish these companies would just sell them individually as this would probably save me an extra $10 or so as I have no intentions of ever watching it on DVD. Maybe they need to sell them in three formats, DVDs, blu rays and combo packs.

The series comes in two DVD cases with one housing the DVDs and the other housing the blu rays. Both fit nicely into the cardboard outer box. The episdodes on the DVDs are split into 6 episodes each and the ones on the blu rays are split into 8 and 4. Both DVDs and blu rays have the exact same extras in that the first disc has an episode 1 commentary and the second has episode 11 commentary, outtakes, clean opening and closing credits and trailers. Extras were kind of weak to me as I wanted some cast interviews, linearts and stuff.

8487766,5,B005W2BWR6,"This is a favorite of mine that I have neglected reviewing based on how hard to classify it is. The story begins with Yamada pledging to have sex with a hundred boys before the end of her first year -- only problem is she is a virgin and wants her first time to be with another virgin. So begins the tale of her setting out to seduce what she believes will be the easiest target. On one hand, this story is about sex. The H in the Japanese title stands for hentai or perverted. That said, this is not a porno. Instead it's a witty, tongue in cheek story about teenage sex with a strong moral underlying the light-hearted premise. Yamada has no idea what she is in for as her over-the-top expectations collide hardcore with reality. This anime dub is hilarious. Take Japanese situational comedy, layer it on top with a double-entendre-filled English translation, delivered by funny voice actors, portraying characters that are as naive as they are lifelike and you get humor on many different levels. I'm glad this is one of the earlier animes I watched and I'm glad it surprised me so much.
