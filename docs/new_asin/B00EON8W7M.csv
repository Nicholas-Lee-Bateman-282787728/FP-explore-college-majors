8607546,3,B00EON8W7M,"Gaspard (Jean-Marie Pallardy) meets Marie-Paule (Irina Sirbu) at a nightclub and gives the singer his number and a tip. It is the type of nightclub guys go to and don't care if the women sing or not. When the manager attempts to strangle her, he gets extinguished and she calls Gaspard as a desperation. He invites her to his castle. She has no intention of leaving.

A year later they plan to get married to the dismay of everyone who knows them. When Gaspard dies, the film becomes a very bad who done it. The death of Gaspard was in a small room with just two people and a female figure standing by the door. This eliminated a lot of suspects to the audience, but not the investigators, who suspect foul play in what looks like an accident.

The killing scene was poorly done, as was most of the script. I had to rewind and watch the killing a few times. The DVD cover has nothing to do with the film. No women are dressed in leather. No guns. No suitcase with American one dollar bills. In fact I have no idea who the woman with the nose ring could be.

English subtitles.
