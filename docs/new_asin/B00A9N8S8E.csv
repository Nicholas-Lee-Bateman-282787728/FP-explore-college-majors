8548740,1,B00A9N8S8E,I wish they had come down or gone up or done anything except what they do in this movie. It starts and stops and that's about it. There is supposed to be some kind of journey here but the film is so in love with the antics of the characters that there is nothing much more than Ashley Burch's being all wide eyed and David Feltzer's being all vacant. The filmmaker should have embraced the nothingness of these characters and just had them sit and talk for an hour and a half at the bus stop. It would have been more entertaining than this.,1471996800,,540,4.201923076923077
8548741,5,B00A9N8S8E,"I have seen this movie multiple times, andI love it. The story is deep, and the characters are believeable, even in their quirky ways. The late David Fetzer did an amazing job bringing the quirky mannerisms of his character to life. He will be missed. Ashly Burch complements the cast, and provides a balance between the two.

I highly recommend this film. It's worth seeing/owning.",1361491200,,382,4.876923076923077
