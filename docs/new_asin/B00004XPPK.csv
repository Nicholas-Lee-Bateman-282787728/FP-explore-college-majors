1368978,4,B00004XPPK,"For years I've wondered about this film, ever since the glimpse to it in ""the Shawshank redemption"" -""Me ? sure I'm decent..."",and ""So this is Jonny Ferl, I've heard a lot about you, Jonny Ferl...""
Finally I got the chance to watch the entire movie, which was quite an experience ! Rita was great, without her the movie wouldn't stand out. Her performance was superb, shadowing the rest of the crew, that ,frankly, wasn't that great. I understand now all the fuss about her in the ""Shawshank"" movie, she deseved it. She is the movie, put any other actor beside her and the movie would still be great, omit her and it's just anither movie. She was really amazing ,talented actress.
I recommend this movie. Like most of the oldies it's a bit naive, nonetheless -worth seeing.",988243200,,773,4.649635036496351

This movie is probably the quintessential femme fatale film noir.  The dialouge is awesome.  It's so film noir! Rita Hayworth is wonderful in this movie. This is probably her best film.  The costumes are very nice. Even the guys dress cool in this film! This is one of the best film noir movies ever made-- it's right up there with 'Double Indemnity' and 'Matlese Falcon'!

1368980,5,B00004XPPK,"I don't care what initials follow your name, JD, MD, PhD.  This movie will hit you right in the solar plexus no matter how PC and ""with it"" you are.  It was made in the '40s, starring Rita Hayworth and Glen Ford, of all people, who normally I like in nothing!  I also usually despise movies where the hero and heroine hate one another until the last few minutes of the movie or book.  Well, just throw the rule books out with ""Gilda.""  This film has chemistry with a capital ""C"".  Sex appeal and the fate of those couples ""meant to be"" exudes from every frame of it.  Rita Hayworth as Gilda is utterly gorgeous and desirable while Glen Ford as Johnny makes all other men pale in comparison.  She's married to his boss who owns a casino-nightclub in South America.  However, there will be no Gilda disappearing in the night skies with her husband as there was in ""Casablanca."" These two lovers aren't that noble.  Instead, they verge on being outright scoundrels! Frankly, I never even thought Hayworth was much of a singer and dancer until I saw her perform ""Put The Blame On Mame"" in this film. Wow! I ate humble pie on that one.  I have this on video and I've lost count of how many times I've seen it, starting in my viewing as a pre-teenager.  Now I'm seriously thinking about getting it in DVD.  You can never have too much ""Gilda.""  My advice: don't even fight it; trash out tonight in total pleasure with ""Gilda.""  You might as well buy it as once will never be enough.

1368981,5,B00004XPPK,"Rita Hayworth's immortal film that haunted her throughout life and career,  once quoted about the men in her life as, ""They went to bed with  Gilda, and woke up with me..."".
Infamous and seductive in its most  popular days, Gilda is a film that represents some of the best and  memorable scenes from the film noir genre. The beauty of this film is in  the silent moments. It is in the contrast of the shadows and light in every  scene from the moment when Glen Ford enters the film from a darken alley to  Rita Hayworth tossing her hair over her shoulder. What is impeccable about  the film is the chemistry of the cast, and style of the film itself.  Several particular scenes that stand out:
---Gilda's sultry performance  of ""Put the Blame on Mame"".
---Gilda and Johnny dancing for the  first time at the club.
---Gilda's curse of damning the woman who wronged  Johnny.
---Gilda's declaration of hate for Johnny, "" I hate you so  much, I'd destroy myself just to take you down with me...""",965174400,73,991,4.531073446327683
1368982,5,B00004XPPK,"Rita hayworth is at her best in this 1940's film noir about a woman who  meets her old flame and pretends not to pay attention to him. Hired by her  husband to be her ""bodyguard"", Glenn Ford watches on as Rita  Hayworth pretends to be interested in countless other men. A winner, with  great performances by the whole cast.",965174400,2,323,4.423728813559322
1368983,4,B00004XPPK,"Some of this reminds me of Casablanca (1942) with the ""philosopher of the washroom"" (Steve Geray) sporting a Peter Lorrie accent and Glenn Ford playing tough like Humphrey Bogart running a night spot in a foreign land, this time Argentina.  Rita Hayworth is Gilda, of course, and the forties Marilyn Monroe.  I'm sure MM studied this film.  The way Monroe does her shoulders and flashes her arm pits as she sings and removes her long-sleeved black gloves in Gentleman Prefer Blondes (1953) is virtually copied from Hayworth's performance here.  You could check it out.
Ford is your confident, two-fisted bad boy that women love, circa 1945, kind of like an old-fashioned John Travolta from Pulp Fiction (1994). But notice how benign those bad boys used to be.  The worst thing he does is cheat at dice.  And while he's fast and street wise about most things, he's like a little boy with women. That used to pass for charm. Maybe it still does.
The plot is a little too precious in places and Charles Vidor's attention to detail hit and miss, mostly hit; yet there's a nice mysterious forties Hollywood atmosphere created (even though it's supposed to be Buenos Aires).  There's a night life, night time feel to the movie with passwords at the door and evening gowns and dark cars caught in street lamps that helps to recall the forties.
You can see the influence of Gilda in movies coming many years after, Chinatown (1974) and L.A.  Confidential (1997) come to mind, the former in the night scenes and the latter because Kim Basinger really looks and behaves more like Rita Hayworth than the Veronica Lake look-alike she portrayed.
Memorable is George Macready as the casino owner, he of the pinched face and the long, curved scar on his right cheek, giving him the sinister, devil-may-care air of a man who has fought and won many duels.  I recall he always played villains and made us believe.
I liked the resolution which showed that Gilda was more a tease than anything else and kind of sweet even though she said, ""If I had been a ranch, they'd have named me the Bar-Nothing."" Quaint and curious is the old Hollywood code which forbade showing her belly button even in a mid-drift and skirt. ...
Hayworth has a sultry and low feminine voice like Laurel Becall (that's the way we liked `em then!)  which is nicely displayed as she sings ""Put the Blame on Mame, Boys.""",963187200,8,2372,4.693975903614458
1368984,4,B00004XPPK,"It's been a few years since I saw Gilda, and I don't remember much of the plot, other than Glenn Ford has trouble with his boss because the boss' wife is Rita Hayworth, a former flame of Ford's.  You're not going to watch  this movie for the plot and the dialogue.  You're going to watch this movie  to see Rita.  Her performance as Gilda has got to be one of the sexiest  performances I have ever seen.  I can't think of an actress at work today  that could have done it better.  Her beauty and appeal are perfectly  showcased in her ""striptease"" to ""Put The Blame on  Mame"".  It's hard to believe that she only takes off one glove in the  number, because it has the same affect as if she took a lot more off!  Plot and dialogue?  Forget it.  Rita?

(The film takes place in Argentina, is set in a casino and has something to do with black-market tungsten, but never mind.)  Sex seems to permeate this very self-aware noir vehicle, whether it's Rita singing ""Put the Blame on Mame, Boys,"" or George MacReady's knife-tipped cane, which seems to take on a gender of its own.

1369080,5,B00004XPPK,"The Film Noir Foundation and the AFI Theater presents an annual film noir festival, ""Noir City DC"" of classic noir movies. I have come to look forward to attending every October.  Among the works presented this year was ""Gilda"", which, released in 1946, celebrates its 70th anniversary this year. Noir scholar and author Foster Hirsch presented an introduction to the film which is included in the National Film Registry of ""historically, culturally, or aesthetically"" significant films maintained by the Library of Congress..

Directed by Charles Vidor and set in Buenos Aires at the conclusion of WW II the film stars Rita Hayworth in her most famous role. The story involves a triangle among the beautiful nightclub singer Gilda, her former lover and small-time gambler, Johnny, (Glen Farrell), and the wealthy operator of an illegal casino and other high-stakes businesses, Balin (George Macready).  The atmosphere is tense and decadent with gambling, violence, and the presence of former Nazis in Argentina following the War.

For modern viewers, a striking feature of the film is the barely repressed sexual attraction between the two male leads, Johnny and Balin, which somehow escaped the critics when the film was released. The sexual symbolism in the form of a cane and double-entendres in the dialogue and the tension between the two men is palpable. The overt story involves a battle for Gilda's affections. Johnny and Gilda had been lovers in New York but the relationship ended badly. When Johnny and Balin start to work together, Balin marries Gilda on impulse while on a trip and asks Johnny to keep an eye on her as Gilda is free with her attentions to other men.  The film highlights the love-hate dynamic between Gilda and Johnny.  The love relationship becomes tied in with an international monopoly in precious metals with Balin at its head and former Nazis as his business partners.

Gilda, with voice dubbed in by Anita Ellis, performs two spectacular song and dance numbers, ""Amado Mio"" and ""Put the Blame on Mame"" late in the film.  ""Put the Blame on Mame"" is the showstopper and more than makes up for the creaky plot.  Rita Hayworth is beautiful and manages to be sweet, seductive and vulnerable all at once as the femme fatale. She regretted her inability to live down the role in her personal life.

""Gilda"" was made to be seen in a beautiful theater on a large screen.  I was fortunate to have the opportunity to see it in this way as part of the Noir City D.C.  This classic film will delight lovers of Rita Hayworth and of film noir.

She is likely a vision of a Goddess. Something Hellenistic and glorious. She is also sweet, talented beyond belief, charming and magnetic. She has an almost hypnotic effect as Gilda , an unforgettable presence. It is as if the smoke and pyres of ancient temples came to life in the form of her slinking to Put The Blame On Mame. Glenn Ford is quite wonderful here as her love/hart object. Their chemistry is pure static.

1369101,5,B00004XPPK,"Fantastic film. Great 40's snappy/sarcastic banter, Rita and the washroom attendant having the best lines. The B&W cinematography is some of Hollywood's bestrivaling even Greg Toland and Stanley Cortez at times.
I'm not a great fan of the usual 30's-40's ""song"" sequence in many non-musical films BUT this is an exception. Rita's singing numbers steal the show and her performance is very easy on the eyes, even if it isn't her actual voice. Cast if great with the exception of Glenn Ford, who is the weakest link. It would be interesting to see what Monty Clift would have done in that role instead of Ford. The sexual tension between Rita and Clift would have made it an even better film in my humble opinion.
Nice, clean, beautiful transfer. The blacks are sharp, deep and dark. Minimum film damage evident.
The extras are pretty good as usual with Criterion. Great little paper fold-out booklet with disc info and a poster of Rita on the back side. New interviews (Scorsese & others) , trailer and a ""lost"" dug up  1964 episode of a ""celebrity"" TV show I had no idea even existed focusing on Rita's career. I like Richard Schickel's past commentaries on other films but this one is somewhat spotty through the film. Not only in interesting content but also in length. I never timed it but it seemed like only 50% of the film has running commentary. If you are going to do it, then go all outsorry Richard, not your best work in this one.",1466121600,5,1441,4.62890625

Like many other old films, I wish it had been remastered and transferred better. It's a bit grainy, like many others, but it doesn't take away from how good the fim is.

The DVD has some bonus features --- a few other noir trailers, and a short documentary on Rita Hayworth's career at Columbia. She was the big sex symbol before Marilyn Monroe... and she IS sexy (and a talented actress and dancer, too).

This is not the fault of the restorers, as most of the old films negatives have not been preserved, and so they only had 16mm prints to work from.

To Glenn Ford, ""You act cool and suave.""  And to Rita Hayworth: ""Say everything with a sultry, sexy voice.""  And to all: ""This way maybe no one will catch on that there really is no story here and that the script doesn't make a whole lot of sense.""  Maybe after watching the extra bonus features and the commentary there will be some explanations about the plot and I will understand it better.  To give you an idea of how this movie made no sense... Macready marries Hayworth and then brings Ford up to the bedroom to meet her.  Why?  In another scene, Ford brings Hayworth home practically at dawn.  Macready meets them when they enter the house.  Their excuse, ""We went swimming.""  Whether or not he buys it is besides the point.  Couldn't the writers come up with a better excuse?  Something more believable?  Much of this movie just didn't make sense.",1454457600,3,1024,4.554945054945055

1369159,5,B00004XPPK,"Men go to bed with Gilda and wake up with me, is how Rita Hayworth often described her troubled personal life.

Certainly GILDA (1948) was the signature film of Hollywoods one-time sex goddess.  Set in a large South American city, the story cast Rita  as the wife of George Macready, owner of an illegal gambling casino.  Shes a lady with a shady past, and that past shows up in the person of her former lover (Glenn Ford).  He just happens to be Macreadys main man.

Ritas sultry singing of Put the Blame on Mame, as she tries to incite the jealousy of Ford is, without doubt, the most memorable moment of this classic piece of film noir, directed by Charles Vidor, who must have been very frustrated while making this movie because of the limitations of the Motion Picture Production Code.

Remade today, GILDA would merit a hard R rating.

The Blu-ray Special Edition from The Criterion Collection features a new high-definition digital restoration of the film with an uncompressed monaural soundtrack.  Extras include a 2010 audio commentary by film critic Richard Schickel,  a new interview with film noir historian Eddie Muller, an episode of the 1960s television series, Hollywood and the Stars that centers on Rita Hayworth,  an essay by critic Sheila  OMalley and much more.

There were 40,000 men involved in Operation Crossroads which was the first post World War II atomic bomb test. Able Day and Baker Day. 1 July and 25 July 1946. Of the forty thousand men thirty-seven thousand were U.S. Navy and the rest were U.S. Army Air Corps. The first bomb, 1 July, was air dropped from a B-29 and was nicknamed ""Gilda.""  The second or Baker Day was an underwater explosion named ""Helen of Bikini.""  Baker caused far more damage and left more nuclear radiation.
One word describes it; ""awesome!"" Benevolence was 20 miles from Able Day and 13 miles from Baker.
Back to the movie, we were in the Marshalls from May until August and there were no females other than Navy Nurses on Benevolence. To enlisted men they may have well have been back in the States.
The newly released movie, ""Gilda"" starring Rita Hayworth and Glen Ford was an immediate hit with sailors who had not seen a woman in months.

Hayworth's signature role furthermore lent veneer to post World War II secret dealings, opened Pandora's box on expeditious morality and made treachery high fashion.  Not just the oversized shoulder pads on Glenn Ford's suits.  Directed by Charles Vidor in 1946, the film not only ""puts the blame on Mame, boys"", it opens a whole new window on black and white cinema, on claroscuro photography, on satin-and-velvet shots by Rudolph Mat as stunning as the scenes they reveal.  The former Margarita Cansino, in sumptuous Jean Louis gowns, does her own dancing, of course--her grandfather taught classic Flamenco in Madrid before the family emigrated to the States-- but the songs, including ""Amado Mo"" (""The Moon Was Yellow"") were expertly dubbed  by Canadian songstress Anita Ellis.

My top 10 is a hodge-podge of films including ""Casablanca,"" ""The Good The Bad and The Ugly,"" ""The Blues Brothers,"" ""Abbot & Costello Meet Frankenstein,"" and ""Pulp Fiction."" About the only common denominator between these films is that I have watched each of them multiple times and never grew tired of them.

The chemistry between Glenn Ford and Rita Hayworth is great. In my humble opinion it is in the same league as the chemistry between Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in ""Casablanca.""

1369313,2,B00004XPPK,"Never has a film been so long on talk and so thin on actual story and character.  ""Gilda"" is an endless stream of talk, with virtually no true emotional underpinning.  The characters are like stick figures.  Indeed, what motivation there is here, abruptly shifts from scene to scene without explanation.  Glenn Ford spends almost the entire movie hating Rita Hayworth, only to suddenly love her and marry her when her husband fakes his own death.  Why would Glenn Ford protect Hayworth's nightclub owner husband from knowing the truth about her running around behind his back at night, if Ford so despises her?  Makes absolutely no sense.  And when Hayworth's husband fakes his own death, and she and Ford can at last be together (although they are extremely hostile toward each other in virtually every scene in the film), no sooner do they get married than she runs away, wanting to be free of him.  He gets her back, only to show hostility toward her.  Makes no sense whatsoever.  And none of their backstory together is ever explained or delved into, and her husband's shady dealings are hinted at but never fully fleshed out.  It's a shell of a movie, interlarded with a few scenes of Hayworth singing in her husband's nightclub, with lots of wooden, melodramatic dialogue to very little effect.

In the days before home videos, film buffs waited years at a time for Gilda to finally show up in the middle of the night on TV.  It is perhaps the role of Gilda, more than any other, that both defined and defines Hayworth as a Hollywood legend.  Gilda is the story of a couple of ex-lovers who cross paths in post-war Rio de Janeiro.  Gilda and Johnny, Johnny and Gilda.  Everyone knows these two SHOULD be together, WANT to be together, HAVE to be together..but them.  Some call the movie film noir.  If it's film noir, then it's not of the dark, gritty variety, but rather, it is of the glittering, lush and plush variety that maybe only ever happens once.  To say that Hayworth's ""Put the Blame on Mame"" number is a show-stopper would be an understatement.

1369338,5,B00004XPPK,"Gilda (Charles Vidor, 1946, 110')

The archetypal film noir, Charles Vidor's principal masterpiece. This cleverly plotted, morally ambiguous tale of intrigue and mnage--trois was one of Columbia's biggest money-earners to date. It stars Glenn Ford and Rita Hayworth in her signature role as the ultimate femme fatale. The film was noted for cinematographer Rudolph Mate's lush photography, costume designer Jean Louis' wardrobe for Hayworth (particularly for the dance numbers), and choreographer Jack Cole's staging of ""Put the Blame on Mame"" and ""Amado Mio"", sung by Anita Ellis.

The film's plot is continually narrated by Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford), a small-time American gambler newly arrived in Buenos Aires. When he wins a lot of money cheating at craps, he has to be rescued from a robbery attempt by a complete stranger, Ballin Mundson (George Macready). Mundson tells him about an illegal high-class casino, but warns him not to practice his skills there. Farrell ignores his advice, cheats at blackjack, and is taken by two men to see the casino's owner, who turns out to be Mundson.

Farrell talks Mundson into hiring him and quickly gains his confidence. One day, Mundson returns from a trip with a beautiful new wife, Gilda (Rita Hayworth). It is immediately apparent that Johnny and Gilda have a history together, though both deny it when Mundson questions them. Eventually, they and their love-hate dynamic continues, in turn eventually leaving Mundson dead. Farrell and Gilda finally reconcile and confess their mutual love, and apologize for the many emotional wounds they have inflicted on one another.

When first released, the staff at Variety magazine liked the film and wrote, ""Hayworth is photographed most beguilingly. The producers have created nothing subtle in the projection of her s.a. [sex appeal], and that's probably been wise. Glenn Ford is the vis--vis, in his first picture part in several years...Gilda is obviously an expensive production -- and shows it. The direction is static, but that's more the fault of the writers.""

More recently, Emanuel Levy wrote a positive review: ""Featuring Rita Hayworth in her best-known performance, Gilda, released just after the end of WWII, draws much of its peculiar power from its mixture of genres and the way its characters interact with each other...Gilda was a cross between a hardcore noir adventure of the 1940s and the cycle of ""women's pictures."" Imbued with a modern perspective, the film is quite remarkable in the way it deals with sexual issues.""

Rita Hayworth, aside from her stunning looks, is also a truly great actress and dancer!

1369341,5,B00004XPPK,"A fascinating film with some brilliant one-liners.  We never get to know exactly what went wrong before Frank and Gilda but it must have been REAL bad.  Frank and Gilda hate each other so much that they are both likely to die of it.  Of course, love and hate are opposite sides of the same coin and this is especially true of Gilda and Frank.  They do everything possible to injure each other.

Things get even more complicated because Gilda--'on the rebound', as she puts it--has married Munson [Macready], a highly complex man.  He is cold, greedy and deadly but, at the same time, he has a thread of real humanity and loves his faithless wife.  With such an intense triangle things simply can't go well.  Somehow, we are supposed to feel some sympathy for the Frank character but he is so psychologically twisted that it is difficult to understand why Gilda has such a passion for him.

Interestingly, Rita Hayworth apparently claimed that 'Gilda' ruined her life.  She married multiple times but claimed that her husbands fell in love with the screen Gilda [who wouldn't?] but, when they woke up in the morning, they were laying next to flesh-and-blood Hayworth--a woman who, apparently, was nothing like exciting, glittering, tortured Gilda.",1344470400,,1246,4.862559241706161

Directed by Charles Vidor

When wealthy Ballin Mundson (George Macready) rescues down at his heels gambler Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford) and invites him to the Buenos Aires casino he owns, both men get more than they wagered on. Farrell convinces Mundson to hire him as casino manager, but is shocked when Mundson introduces his new bride, and Farrell's old flame, Gilda (Rita Hayworth).Though Farrell is unwavering in his loyalty to his employer, and he and Gilda treat each other with contempt, Mundson realizes that the torch never died for either of the former lovers. Ordered to guard Gilda, Farrell tries to convince himself that he's protecting Mundson's interests, but Gilda sees through his self-deception. Meanwhile, Mundson reveals to Farrell that his primary business is control of an international tungsten cartel that he plans to use to further his fascist ends.

Great tight tense script, direction and cast makes an all-time classic noir, but it's George Macready who gives such an icy cold character  performance, that when he's on the screen nobody else seems to be there, even though Hayworth and Ford are steaming up the cameras with their hot steaming scenes.

* Special footnote: ~ Rita Hayworth had to wear a corset while shooting ""Put the Blame on Mame,"" as she gave birth to her first daughter, Rebecca, months before filming ~ In the scene where Gilda is brought back to Argentina by Tom, she slaps Johnny hard across both sides of his face. In reality, Rita Hayworth's smacks broke two of 'Glenn Ford''s teeth. He held his place until the take was finished ~ The photo of Johnny Farrell as a baby is a picture of 'Glenn Ford''s real-life son, Peter Ford.

1369346,5,B00004XPPK,"Gilda may be the best classic film noir ever for a number of reasons, I mean the best of the black and white classics of the 40's and 50's. The many reviewers on this site have done a good job describing the plot, the passion, and Rita's unequal performance.  But Gilda is much more than that.  It is the incarnation of the 40's film atmosphere of elegance and romance.  We are in post war 1945 and the American film noir genre is blossoming, and ironically where?  Not in L.A. or N.Y. but in Buenos Ayres where ex Nazis populate the countryside. Another way to look at Gilda is through nostalgic eyes. You have to be old enough to remember the post war years of the optimism turned pessimism.  And in the middle of it comes Gilda, a movie that nobody would dare remake and stay alive, that gave us the once in a lifetime gift of the love Godess.",1288483200,2,846,4.29559748427673

1369351,4,B00004XPPK,"This is one of those films I never think is all that good, but I keep going back to it every four or five years. Perhaps it's just to get another look at Rita Hayworth while she was still THE glamor woman of the period (1940 to about 1948). At times, she is just jaw-dropping stunning.

Glenn Ford provides some narration and does his normally-competent job as the lead actor but I really liked George Macready's performance more. He is really good as the rich husband, just fascinating to watch.

This film would have been so much better had it been cut about 20 minutes. It bogs down a little over halfway through (but recovers). The dialog is what makes this story interesting for the most part, particularly in the first half of the film which is far better than the second half, and that includes the cinematography. The second half is a lot more melodrama than film noir.",1234569600,2,877,4.509433962264151

1369354,5,B00004XPPK,"and how! Even steamy Gilda can't snuff the smoldering flame shared by Johnnie and Ballin.

So here's the gist: Johnnie (Glenn Ford) is a ne'er do well rolling around in Argentina when he rolls into Ballin's (George Macready) arms. I mean, hands. Johnnie becomes Ballin's right hand man, managing his casino and running his errands. One night, one of his errands becomes babysitting the Lovely Rita, I mean, Gilda. Turns out, he knew Gilda from before and I mean KNEW her from before! Something nuclear must have happened because on the rebound he went for Ballin and man alive he doesn't like Gilda. I hate every bone in your body but mine, he emotes. Things go terribly wrong all over. Turns out Ballin is somehow wrapped up with some Nazis and some tungsten and he hasn't told Johnnie. Gilda sings and taunts and smokes cigarettes. Johnnie does a lot of frustrated smoking as well. Gilda and Johnnie end up thrown together and Johnnie lets his sadomasochistic self loose on the hapless girl. It's all OK in the end, but only when Johnnie's True Love, Ballin, is completely removed from the picture.
The homoerotic tension in this movie is unbelievable. I was completely surprised by it. Rita Hayworth is almost a caricature of female lustiness but she is but a little candle compared to the blast furnace of the Johnnie/Ballin romance. As an example, when Johnnie and Gilda are discovered together by Ballin, who chases after the distraught Ballin? His wife? No! It's Johnnie running after him, begging for another chance.

1369362,2,B00004XPPK,"'Johnny' Farrell is a small-time gambler/card cheat who finds himself being robbed at gunpoint just after leaving a game of dice with some soldiers in Buenos Aires. A weird guy with a German accent, Ballin Mundson, just happens to be strolling along down by the docks and saves Johnny by whipping out a sharp knife hidden inside his cane. Thus begins the very strange and not all that entertaining pseudo-noir, 'Gilda'. Mundson hands Johnny his card and invites him to play at his casino. Before you know it, Mundson hires Johnny as the manager after Johnny convinces him that he can use his skills as a crooked gambler to ferret out customers bent on cheating the house. Mundson introduces Johnny to his wife, Gilda, played by Rita Hayworth. Gilda can't stand Mundson but obviously married him for his money.

The only thing that is truly understandable in this movie is Gilda's disdain for Mundson who is continually trying to suck up to her acting like a besotted 16 year old wuss. Mundson's jealousy knows no bounds and it's this jealousy that defines his character--so much so that the character becomes totally one-note. There is so much of Mundson's jealousy we can take before saying, 'enough already'. Fortunately for the film-goer, Mundson disappears halfway through the movie, only to return at the end.

Meanwhile, without providing any back story, Johnny and Gilda knew each other before. When they meet again they have a thorough disdain for one another. Johnny tells Gilda, ""I hate you"", Gilda tells Johnny, ""I hate you"" and one of them (or maybe both, I can't remember) slaps the other in the face. Like Mundson's jealousy, the disdain is unrelenting but at a certain point they declare their love for one another, end up in a passionate embrace and before you know it, get married. Finally, closet nice-guy Johnny starts morphing into Mundson (after Johnny takes over the casino following Mundson's apparent suicide, nose-diving his single pilot aircraft into the ocean)and becomes jealous of Gilda's new singles life. Gilda tells Johnny that dating other men is just an act for Johnny to pay more attention to her but Johnny won't buy it. He becomes so jealous that he has one of his henchmen at the casino physically remove every new date from Gilda's proximity causing her to flee to Montevideo where she meets a new man, a lawyer who convinces her to return home and get an annulment. When she returns, she finds out that her new boyfriend, the lawyer, was paid by Johnny to get her to return. Gilda is shattered when Johnny tells her that annulments are not legally valid in Buenos Aires (unfortunately Gilda is not a law school graduate!).

Just like Mundson, Johnny's jealousy toward Gilda becomes tiresome. But unlike Mundson, Johnny's 'true feelings' toward Gilda cannot be kept down. He somehow realizes that he's been the biggest heel all along and once again falls for Gilda (please don't ask me what motivates these sudden reversals in the characters' behavior). Just as Johnny changes his mind about Gilda (again) Mundson returns and in a jealous rage attempts to murder both Johnny and Gilda. Mundson is struck down by the kindly bathroom attendant who presciently has referred to Johnny as a 'peasant' from the beginning of the film. The police inspector does his Captain Renault imitation from Casablanca by stepping in and hinting that Johnny and Gilda will not be charged for Mundson's death, that the official cause of death is still a suicide and not to matter anyway, it was a justifiable homicide.

There is also a subplot in 'Gilda' that is just as confusing as the love triangle. Mundson has cornered the Tungsten market and double-crossed two Germans he knew during the War who show up at the Casino claiming they are the rightful leaders of a cartel. We never find out anything about the Germans except that Mundson ends up killing one of them and that's why he has to flee (oh there's another weird guy, a businessman who attempts to shoot Mundson at the casino after Mundson won't let him do business with a member of his cartel. The weird guy is unable to kill Mundson so he ends up shooting himself). As one poster aptly put it here, Gilda is a 'poor man's Casablanca'. In some ways, Gilda is so bad that it's actually somewhat entertaining. One can actually sit back and enjoy all the full blown histrionics. But ultimately none of the jealous machinations of the characters are ever sufficiently explained nor are the reversals--the odd changes of heart where the lovers are reconciled. Gilda is a story where the characters don't earn our respect--they're locked in a pointless battle simply designed to titillate the masses of people soon to become addicted to daytime soap operas on television in the 1950s.",1226620800,13,4760,4.858374384236453

Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford) is an American drifter who has somehow landed in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  He needs cash to survive and takes his chances using loaded dice to gamble with sailors.  Quitting while he is ahead, Johnny leaves the dice game with a big bankroll and is accosted in the port by a gunman.  To his surprise, the holdup is thwarted by a passerby, Ballin Mundson (George Macready). One thing leads to another and eventually Johnny becomes Mundson's devoted right hand man and the manager of his very lucrative casino business.  After taking an extended overseas business trip, Mundson returns to Buenos Aires with a bride - Gilda (Rita Hayworth).  Mundson introduces Johnny and Gilda, hoping these two important people in his life will like each other.  He doesn't realize that Gilda and Johnny have known each other in the past, and both have been trying to escape their painful shared history together.  Sparks fly between them as Gilda does everything in her power to torment Johnny, and Johnny is equally determined to make Gilda feel cheap and insignificant.  After sixty years, the tension between Hayworth and Ford is still palpable.

Rita Hayworth was at the height of her beauty and touted as the sexiest woman alive when ""Gilda"" was made in 1946.  Even today she still scorches the screen as she tosses her hair and performs a clothed strip tease to the torchy song, ""Put the Blame on Mame.""

This print of ""Gilda"" has been restored by UCLA with funding from Sony Pictures.  The black and white video has been cleaned up beautifully.  There are still some white spots that flash from time to time but overall this version looks very good.  The sound track is clear with no dead spots or unexpected drops in volume.

Rita Hayworth was a beautiful dancer, but she did not do her own singing.  In ""Gilda"" she is lip syncing to the voice of Anita Ellis.

The DVD includes a display of vintage advertising for ""Gilda"" as well as theatrical trailers.  A section called ""talent files"" offers printed biography and filmography information about director, Charles Vidor, Rita Hayworth,  Glenn Ford, and George Macready.  The most prominent bonus is a featurette about the career of Rita Hayworth at Colombia Studios.  Interesting to see how Rita looked before the studio changed her hairline with electrolysis, and turned her into a redhead.  For those who may not be familiar with her background, Rita was the daughter and granddaughter of professional dancers who had been trained since early childhood to become a talented dancer.

1369367,4,B00004XPPK,"In film noir, usually the spider-woman (the gorgeous Rita Hayworth) traps the man with her seductive powers, often getting him to kill for her before she herself is killed/punished for her crimes of transgressing in a man's world. This film doesn't quite follow the formula. The movie stars two male protagonists who are clearly more interested in each other than in Gilda, even though Rita Hayworth is by far one of the most beautiful women ever to be filmed.

Recently restored for DVD release, the film looks sharp and the graininess is gone from the original. Except for the inconsistent use of shadows, the dark/light style is quite honed. The sound quality is high but the amplitude is low, so you will have to turn your speakers up to hear the film clearly.

I admit that I laughed through much of the film as the heterosexual, homosexual, AND bisexual playfulness of the dialogue is simply a joy to listen to, mostly due to Hayworth's goddess-ness. The film ends on a boring, unbelievable moment, but it's typical Hollywood of the time: Good starts, great middles, dumb endings.",1215216000,2,1086,4.833333333333333

1369371,4,B00004XPPK,"Gilda (1946)
Directed: Charles Vidor, With: Rita Hayworth,, Glenn Ford,
  George Macready
A typical melodrama of the forties, with an unusual advantage: it had in it the sex goddess of the times, Rita Hayworth, then, at 27, reigning supreme, for no other female star could match her sexual bravado, beauty, if not talent. Talent, not for winning Oscars, but for subjecting an audience to a hypnotic state reserved only for celestial figures that became flesh. There are a couple of other factors that make this oldie still watchable and memorable. Glenn Ford, early in his career, gives a magnetic performance as her frustrated lover, who finally wins her, but who had to undergo the conflicts of loyalty to his boss and overcome his dislike for the type of women he thought his inamorata represented. And the final reason is George Macready himself. A polished villain, scarred on one cheek, wielding a cane with a stiletto in it, he is one of those villains Hollywood produced in the `40s and `50s--Basil Rathbone, George Sanders, James Mason, among others--that audiences loved to hate. He is corrupt and totally unscrupulous, running an illegal casino in Argentina, but fatally smitten by the charms of Hayworth, and insanely jealous.

The mix is good, though the plot is murky. We don't quite know whether Macready is a megalomaniac Nazi and what the cartel he presides over really is, but we have the tension created among the three intensify as the movie progresses, and Hayworth's dancing and ""singing"" at the right moments add to the allure of this movie, semi-forgotten for its message (there is none) but reminding us what Hollywood had at its disposal women of the silver screen whose sex appeal (without much bare skin) has never been duplicated.

Film category: film noir? But that does not matter either, for only the performances here are worth the watching. Don't try popcorn, or valium, while watching. Just sip some wine, if your predilections do not prohibit,",1195344000,14,1979,4.987878787878788

Then, later in the weekend, I watched ""Gilda"", which is a completely different kind of film.  IT's film noir, it's dramatic, it's a 1940's film starring one of the best actresses to come from that time, Rita Hayworth.  She stars, sings, dances, shimmies, and shakes like the earthquake she sings of in ""Put the Blame on Mame.""  Rita was the ultimate package for Hollywood.  A Truly talented Redheaded dynamo..

In the film, Gilda is married to an older man who runs a casino in Buenos Aires.  An ex-lover, played by Glenn Ford, comes back into the picture as her husbands' helping hands and eventually he is trying to use his own hands to help himself to Gilda.  Gilda is red hot and rearing to go with the first guy who will have her.  She yearns for attention, and thrives on the reaction she gets as well.

Not the best well known of it's kind, this film noir is a fine film which turns out to be quite a great work thanks to the shining star called Rita Hayworth.

1369375,5,B00004XPPK,"Rita Hayworth radiates superabundant sensuality as the magnetic center of this film. Hayworth's beauty stands outside of time; her changing moods and expressions affect us powerfully, at a pre- or nonverbal level. (Therefore most attempts to analyze this film fail, beyond general statements about Hayworth as an iconic femme fatale). There is an overwhelming ambiguous sexuality permeating the film, almost palpable, which also explains its enduring appeal. Ballin (George Macready) voyeuristically pushes Johnny (Glenn Ford) toward his wife Gilda (Hayworth). But there is an equally strong sexual attraction/undercurrent between Ballin and Johnny throughout, never resolved, and the ""happy ending"" has a tacked-on quality, as though merely to satisfy convention and audience expectations. The strange nature of love and love-hate is wonderfully explored by this unusual love triangle. A very handsome and suave Argentine police official/detective (Joseph Calleia) is thrown in for good measure. This film deals with eternal truths about masculinity, femininity, and the dark, complex and unpredictable forces of sexuality. How the U.S. could have slipped into the anodyne sanitized 1950s after films like this is a mystery to me. Watching Hayworth perform makes it clear that most so-called ""stars"" of today are absurd nonentities.",1177545600,9,1333,5.8061224489795915

cinematic immortality. She plays the

Women of the world.  Blatant voyeurism
is more than justified when it comes to
reasons for watching this film. Hayworth is
perfect and she strolls through this movie
with the confidence and sex appeal of a
super model down a runway.

The plot is no disappointment, either. Johnny Farrell (Glen Ford)
wears multiple hats: first, Gilda's ""chaperone/protector,""
and later, her husband. In between, Gilda makes
life hell for Johnny (the man who wronged her way back when)
by leading a care-free life of hedonism;
at Johnny's emotional expense, no less. The two are later married
after Ballin Mundson (Gilda's husband and Johnny's boss) fakes his
death to escape the law.  Johnny inflicts emotional anguish on
Gilda by restricting her freedom. Gilda rebels and runs away. Her
famous ""Put the Blame on Mame"" striptrease is her classic
statement of rebellion. From there, more clever twists
and turns finally result in Gilda and Johnny finally recognizing
their true love for each other.

Don't think twice; get this movie. It's guaranteed enjoyment

1369378,4,B00004XPPK,"Like everyone says, this is a very strange story.  It seems to be a love-triangle, but there are more angles than three. For about half the film I thought Glenn Ford was meant to be in love with the Ballin Mundson (Ballin Mundson?) character, because he saved Ford's life (what for?), then gave him a job and was good to him. So far, so odd, but relatively simple to understand. When Rita shows up things become extremely complicated: incomprehensible in fact.  Who had run out on who, and why? I think we should have been told. Was it something to do with Rita's earlier line of work?  A lot of blame was being put on Rita, but so far as I could see she wasn't doing much wrong. Well, maybe just a bit of a tease, but so lovely, sweet and tender you'd forgive her anything. Actually, nobody's motivation here was the slightest bit convincing.  Also, as somebody else has said, the plot reads as if someone put together the pieces left on the cutting-room floor after Casablanca. Anyway, two-thirds into the story,  we get a totally alien sub-plot about conquering the world by cornering the tungsten filament market, which we couldn't care less about, as it has  nothing to do with the tensions between the three main players.  This part is boring and even more unconvincing than the original triangle. The sinister Mr Mundson looked good in his part, but it seemed as if he wasn't being allowed to get his teeth into the role.  Glenn Ford has never impressed me as a personality. He never seems to have what it takes: I can't imagine Rita falling for him, nor can I believe he could take out heavies with his puff-ball punches. I can't even believe he'd behave like the nasty little swine he's supposed to be. So why have I watched this movie two or three times, and why will I watch it again?

Whether she appears on stage performing a different kind of hit record or pretending to hate her former lover as much as she loves him, Rita was uninhibitedly erotic, making more persistent men's suspicions that girls with long hair and nice figures had a turbulent nature to equal...

Rita never said she could act, but then she rarely had to... Her movies--of which ""Gilda"" is perhaps the most famous--were little more than showcases for her ample charms, but the largely male audiences that cheered Rita's every picture didn't seem to mind... She was more than a favorite pinup; she was the much-married, scandal-ridden reincarnation of the movie queens of a bygone era...

Hayworth--in complete control of Vidor's camera and of her audience-- performed dynamic moves while trying to look, and feel, too sexy... In that night, she slowly begins to peel off her long black gloves in a symbolic striptease, while rendering her suggestively sexy song ""Put the Blame On Mame,"" to the public, electrifying subsequently Glenn Ford, and millions of hot-blooded men around the world...

Rita captured everything about Gilda's character... She's beautiful, she's malicious, she's suggestive, she's annoying, she's greedy, she's vengeful, and she's awfully superstitious...

Gilda made it sound--There is a heat that one can feel and its intensity is pretty high...The movie shifts into a tremendous struggle between temptation and loyalty, jealousy and envy, suspicion and mistrust, love and desire...

The character of Gilda didn't show up in the film until about 30 minutes into the movie, that tells you how much faith they had in Ms Hayworth as the star. Her rendition of  ""Put The Blame On Mame "" was the highlight of the movie for me, using her hair and hips as weapons she seduced the world. The chemistry between she and Ford is electric, Bogart was originally supposed to play Johnny Farrall but once he found out Rita Hayworth would be playing Gilda he told them ""no thank you"" With Hayworth in the movie no one will look at me.

The strong, sensual heat generated between Hayworth and Ford is guaranteed to make you very hot beneath your collar. Was there ever a better portrayal of a sizzling love/hate entanglement?

There is a hinted homosexual undertone in the relationship between sinister casino owner Ballin Mundson (George Macready) and his right-hand, Johnny Farrell (Ford), but as soon as Ballin's provocative new wife, Gilda (Hayworth) arrives on the scene, that pretty much goes out the window. The priceless expression on Johnny's face when he discovers that Mundson's bride and his ex-lover are one and the same (amid the famous hair-toss), is a moment that just cannot be beat. Ballin becomes all the more evil and controlling, at first only to Gilda (sensing that she and Johnny knew each other before), but then his bizarre business dealings and plans begin to unravel, leading to a great plot-twist.

Gilda succeeds in arousing Johnny's jealousy through her flirtations with other men, while he tries to keep her supposedly ""indecent"" behavior from the boss. As much as he claims to despise her, it is obvious that neither one have gotten over the hurt of their ""past association"". When Johnny has the opportunity to punish her for what he believes to be her sinful behavior, the sparks between them go up another notch. Those slaps that they inflict on each other (love hurts!), and of course, Hayworth's famous ""Put The Blame On Mame"" mock striptease (dubbed by Anita Ellis) - that one will linger in your head for a long, long time.

Rescued by Ballin Mudson (George Mac Ready) from a thug that intends him to rob. Finally the expected codes of loyalty and friendship are established.

On the other hand will make the best she can and through her erotic artifices and suggesting voice will intend to take revenge and make suffer both men.
Johnny will marry Gilda when Ballin suffers a serious accident crash and then reappears to establish the ancient state of things.
As you see this is an intriguing puzzle that combines cleverly betray, greed, wounded self stem, jealous feelings, and hidden emotions. Nothing is innocent and no happiness is free. You've got to pay a prize no matter how high can  be. Dark game of shadowy manipulations so typical of the low depths.
A true masterpiece that has overcome its own times to become not only a status cult movie but a sublime and well positioned classic, maintaining its actuality and freshness despite having elapsed sixty years.

1369407,5,B00004XPPK,"Gilda is one of those movies which really helped define the film noir cycle of the 1940's-1950's.  Rita Hayworth is powerful as the femme fatale who is ruthless; and then, yet, sympathetic.  Glen Ford is the protagonist, but not the hero.  Great (and dark) acting.  Its in glorious black and white.  The viewer gets so involved in the acting and the story, one forgets it is not in color very quickly.  Themes to watch for:  the male figure is strong in regard to just about everything except when it comes to interacting with Gilda.  The femme fatale is tempting.  Watch Gilda and begin to understand what film noir is all about.

1369408,4,B00004XPPK,"This review is for the 2000 Columbia DVD release.

The story opens on the waterfront of Buenes Aires during World War II where a cheating street gambler named Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford) is rescued from an armed robbery by a more refined gentleman named Ballin Mundson (George Macready).  Mundson invites Farrell to his posh casino and Farrell shows up and uses slight of hand to go on huge winning streak at the blackjack table.  In spite of Farrell's untrustworthiness, Mundson hires Farrell to be his right hand man for overseeing the casino operations.  Not too long after that, Mundson goes out of town and returns with a beautiful wife named Gilda (Rita Hayworth).  When Mundson introduces Farrell to Gilda, there is instant tension and discomfort between the two.  Its obvious they have noticable distain for each other.  This opens up a long and loathsome relationship between all three of these characters.

The saving grace of the movie is Rita Hayworth.  She lights up the screen with beauty and style and can even sing and dance.  Her first scene in the movie is one of the best glamour shots in the history of filmmaking.  She radiates with charm and grace in that famous scene.  But in this film, she plays a character where her beauty is just a thin veneer for an extraordinary amount of distain and she constantly undermines the other two men.

The plot of this movie is not easy to follow.  There is clearly a hidden past between Gilda and Johnny, but only a few vague personal remarks seem to be the only clues of their prior history.  There is also another subplot between Mundson and a group of men with a powerful and subversive business plan.  That plot too is underdeveloped.  All in all, it's a very ambiguous story of people with a beautiful facade, but rotten to the core.  It seemed more of a visual exercise than a mental one.

As for the DVD, the movie was restored, but not meticuously.  There is still a lot of tiny specs of film loss throughout most of the movie, but the picture quality is still very sharp.  The sound is excellent.  There are also a handful of brief but informative bonus features.

1369409,5,B00004XPPK,"Rita Hayworth is at her sultry best in a role that was made for her in Charles Vidor's 1946 film noir classic ""Gilda"".

Glenn Ford playing gambler Johnny Farrell has a chance encounter with arrogant Buenos Aires casino owner Ballin Mundson played by scar faced George Macready.  Ford eventually gains his trust and is charged with running the casino.  Macready returns from a business trip and much to Ford's surprise reveals his new wife and party girl, Gilda.  Little did the intensely jealous Macready know that Ford and Hayworth had been lovers and still had feelings for each other.  And so began a rather sticky and tortuous love triangle, although with Ford being respectful and keeping his distance.

We later find out that Macready's business extends quite a bit further than gambling.  He is the head of a cartel controlling the metal, tungsten.  He apparently acquired this from German sources during the war and they wished to reclaim it.

The story proceeds with suspense and some torrid scenes featuring Hayworth performing provocative song and dance routines.  The Argentine police are aware of what is transpiring and a sympathetic detective Obregon played by Maltese born Joseph Calleia assures that the story has a satisfying ending.

Director Vidor does a nice job in showcasing Hayworth who turned this role into a signature piece of her acting ability.  Ford and Macready do very well in their roles but Hayworth lights up the screen with her presence.  The plot while not overly dramatic does enough to plausibly tie the action together.",1122854400,,1559,5.019455252918288

1369411,5,B00004XPPK,"Johnny is a small time, but talented, hustler who finds himself at the wrong end of a gun on the dark back streets of Buenos Aires. He is rescued by a mysterious and controlling stranger, Ballin Mundson, who ends up being the owner of a club/casino that operates under the radar of the law. Johnny and Ballin form a close partnership with Johnny being the ""man who runs the joint"" and Ballin the Master. When Ballin takes a short leave and comes back married to the gorgeous Gilda, a threesome develops that puts a strain on the partnership. There is a burning mutual dislike between Johnny and Gilda. When Gilda feigns ignorance over not remembering his name, she coyly replies, ""Johnny. So hard to remember . . . and so easy to forget."" Of course there's much more to their acquaintance than they are willing to acknowledge, and a fusion of sexual heat, jealousy, fear and hatred keep the tension tightly wound which fuels the film. And of course there is Rita Hayworth up front and center. All the accolades that have been showered on her sexy ""striptease"" interpretation of ""Put the Blame on Mame"" are true! And still this film has much more to offer; an economical but effective story line; a tight witty script loaded with innuendo; and superb acting all around, especially the overlooked icy performance of George Macready as Ballin Mundson.",1106784000,3,1348,4.740425531914894
1369412,4,B00004XPPK,"As World War II ends, a young hustler in Buenos Aires, Argentina, meets a wealthy casino owner with whom he has a lot in common. The hustler, Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford), becomes the casino's manager and right-hand man to aristocratic Ballin Mundson's (George Macready). The two men become perfect partners in business and close friends. One day, Mundson returns from vacation with a new wife, Gilda (Rita Hayworth), an attractive, headstrong young woman whom Johnny has met before. Gilda's presence threatens the men's relationship and their equilibrium.

 Thanks to her smashing rendition of ""Put the Blame on Mame"", ""Gilda"" is Rita Hayworth's best-remembered role. Many have called it a ""clothed strip tease"". It's certainly a sexy, energetic, eye-catching performance. Rita Hayworth never sang in movies, though. Anita Ellis provided the voice for ""Put the Blame on Mame"".

 ""Gilda"" owes most of its success to Rita Hayworth's charisma. Love triangles are always popular fodder, but this one doesn't make a bit of sense. The story is incomprehensible. The tension that exists between Gilda and Johnny is constantly alluded to, but never explained. The film features the most hateful romance I've ever seen. ""Gilda"" might be about people imprisoned by their own desires, but to say it is about anything would be presumptuous. ""Gilda"" has great style, though, and seductive noir-ish characters. So it's entertaining, even if the story is off the wall.

 The DVD: Bonus features include one featurette and some odds and ends. ""Rita Hayworth: The Columbia Lady"" is a 9-minute documentary that follows Hayworth's career at Columbia Studios, where she made 32 films between 1936 and 1953. It doesn't say much, but there are nice film clips. ""Vintage Advertising"" displays 8 old movie posters for ""Gilda"". ""Talent File"" provides written bios and abridged filmographies for director Charles Vidor and the film's three stars. ""Theatrical Trailers"" includes 4 old trailers for: ""Gilda"", ""The Loves of Carmen"" (which also starred Hayworth and Glenn Ford), ""A Man for All Seasons"", and ""The Last Hurrah"". Subtitles are available in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, and Thai. Dubbing is available in French, Spanish, and Portuguese.",1090972800,29,2245,5.363636363636363
1369413,5,B00004XPPK,"Being a film noir fan, I acknowledged the fact that Gilda was definately on my ""must-see"" list. But nothing had prepared me for how much I would like it!! The dialogue is...well, not top-rate, but you do you expect from a noir that's not Bogey or Robinson? It's classic, classic I tell you!

 And even more importantly, the love triangle is so tightly constructed, you'll find yourself struggling for Gilda's decision even more than Glenn Ford. In fact, Hayworth's first appearance in the film is one of the most famous in Hollywood history, and in just one shot, you can tell exactly who and what she was to Ford.

 Oh, and one more thing--if you happen to like classic 40s songs (like i do--especially if u heard Bacall in To Have and Have Not & the Big Sleep and liked it) you will LOVE Gilda's rendition of ""Put The Blame On Mame."" Every film historian around knows that song, and through the slinky performance, we know that Ford is a fly caught in Gilda's sticky web.

1369414,5,B00004XPPK,"Rita Hayworth went down in Hollywood history as the Love Goddess.  Her title role in *Gilda* (Columbia Pictures, 1946) leaves no doubt why.  Yet here she is much more than a sex symbol. For one thing, Rita was a seriously talented actress.  For another, she was one of the best dancers in films.  To this day her performance in *Gilda* remains unrivaled as a combo of skill, sensuality, sensitivity, and sheer drop-dead pulchritude.  Columbia's catchy ad-phrase for the film was, ""There never was a woman like Gilda.""  You'd better believe it. Glenn Ford perfectly fills out the character of Johnny Farrel, the young gambler who hates to love femme fatale Gilda.  In return, Gilda loves to hate Johnny.  George MacReady offers an outstanding performance as murderous Ballin Mundson, the man Gilda fears.
If you like movies that challenge the viewer to figure out hidden meanings, then *Gilda* is for you.  ""Maybe that stands for something,"" Rita-as-Gilda says near the beginning; ""Maybe that means something,"" she says near the end.  Halfway through she says, ""Any psychiatrist would say that means something."" The question of interpretation hangs over the entire film, loaded as it is with symbolism and double-entendres.
On the other hand, you can ignore the subtext and enjoy *Gilda* as a noirish romantic mystery-thriller.  It's a beautiful flick to look at in black and white, and it's never boring, even all the decades since it was made.  Some reviewers say the plot is difficult to follow.  I don't agree; the story is both logical and economical.  But that may be because I understand *Gilda* to be a dramatized introduction to the psychological concepts of C.G. Jung.  Never mind.  If you like your movies to be just movies, *Gilda* tastefully blends ingredients from *Casablanca*, *The Maltese Falcon*, *Notorious* and *The Big Sleep*, then stirs in its own original sauce.  In my opinion, it's an improvement upon those classics, as fine as they are by themselves.
I wouldn't call *Gilda* a true film noir, for the reason that at the end the male and female leads are triumphant instead of tormented.  Great films of the 1940s that had real ""noir"" (black) denouements are *Criss Cross*, *Detour*, *Double Indemnity*, *Scarlet Street*, *The Killers* and *The Postman Always Rings Twice*.  Still, on their way to a happy ending Johnny and Gilda pass through a landscape that is darker and more suggestive of spiritual abandonment than most '40s film noirs dared explore.  At the same time, because of the intense chemistry between the leads, *Gilda* sizzles hotter than any film of that period I can think of.

1369416,5,B00004XPPK,"Much has been made of the obvious pleasures in ""Gilda"" -- the stunning, idol-making performance of Rita Hayworth; the famous striptease-that-really-is-a-tease; the overripe dialogue (somebody could make a good drinking game based on how many times somebody says ""Johnny"" to Glenn Ford); the perversely sexual subtexts involving Gilda and Johnny, Gilda and Ballin, and certainly, Ballin and Johnny (!)  But the other pleasures of this movie shouldn't be overlooked.  For one thing, it's one of the best LOOKING movies ever to come out of the 1940's:  stunning sets, gorgeous costumes, and most of all, eye-popping black-and-white photography, making effective use of noir conventions (everyone is forever stepping into or out of shadows) and creating Glenn Ford and Rita Hayworth as pinnacles of physical beauty; neither one ever looked this good again, although Rita came close in ""You Were Never Lovelier"".
Maybe my favorite overlooked treat in ""Gilda"" is the enigmatic character of Uncle Pio, who has some of the best lines in the movie as he wittily comments on the foibles of the characters,
acting as a sort of Shakespearean Fool.  Screenwriting this good is certainly part of what makes ""Gilda"" so special and brings its fans back to watch again and again.
One final comment: if Rita Hayworth really does her own singing during the quiet version of ""Mame"" in the nightclub at 5 a.m., as I've read and heard, the lady was not only gorgeous and a terrific dancer, she had quite a voice, too!",1063152000,13,1495,5.040485829959514

1369418,4,B00004XPPK,"Like so many other film noir classics of the golden age, the plot of ""Gilda"" really makes no sense.  She's in love with a penniless bum, Johnny (Glen Ford)who just happens to fall into a tub of butter after a big time casino thug (Joel McCready)who also happens to be Gilda's new husband, elevates Johnny to the level of fellow racketeer.  There's also some business involving some Nazi's but this is extremely sketchy at best.  What is really quite bizarre is the way Johnny and Gilda seem to absolutely hate one another until five minutes before the film is over.  One thing about the film remains electric, Rita Hayworth!  Her striptease and song ""Put The Blame on Mame"" is one of a handful of the cinema's guilty pleasures.
I'm not certain whether Columbia Home Video is deliberately trying to tick off their consumer base with this release or not.  Although most of the film exhibits a fairly good transfer, there are moments when the film element is down right grainy.  Scratches inherent in the original camera negative are quite prominent in spots.  No aliaising or shimmering of fine details, thank heaven! The audio is nicely restored.  Columbia gives us a featurette as a suppliment but here too I get the sense from Columbia that they really just wanted to tick me off.  The featurette starts out good, has a ton of clips to show Hayworth's rise as a major screen goddess and then, right in the middle of her career, quite suddenly just ends with a blacked out screen.  No summation of Rita, the actress, the women or the legend.  Nothing!  Hey, Columbia, if you're going to do a documentary - do the whole thing! BOTTOM LINE: Movie - yes.

Gilda gets wilder to test the limits of this bodyguard and pushes him to the brink. She performs a Latin-esque song/dance number ""Amado Mio"" that spells out her feelings.

She's her own worst enemy, and all because... well, you'll have to watch and find out. I won't be so kind as to spoil the ending for you (see some of the other reviews for that), but I will agree with others in saying it's an unsatisfying cop-out. It doesn't matter, though. The first hour&40 make this DEFINITELY worth watching.
To the previous reviewer who called this film misogynistic: say what? Gilda's more manly than any of the actual males in this movie, who may or may not be gay. Besides, how can one female's actions stand for females as a whole? Since there are no other women protagonists in this diegesis to compare Gilda with, that reading rests on a faulty basis.",1019260800,2,918,4.638036809815951
1369422,5,B00004XPPK,"This film is rightly celebrated as Rita Hayworth's greatest film.  Certainly, it contains her most famous visual moment, and what is probably one of the most famous images in the history of film.  People recognize this shot, even if they have never seen GILDA.  George Maccready is escorting his right hand man Glenn Ford up the staircase of his mansion, telling him about his new bride.  As they reach the top of the stairs, he calls out to his wife, ""Gilda, are you decent?""  The camera jumps into the dressing room, to a tight close up of a woman with her hair thrown forward so she can brush it out.  Gilda dips her head, throws back her hair, reveals her beautiful face, and almost mockingly replies, ""Who, me?""  The way she responds, we instantly know that we are dealing with a thoroughly bad woman.
Make no mistake about it:  this film is about people doing inconceivably nasty things to one another.  Gilda isn't so much a loose woman as she is a woman intent on revenge.  She has married Maccready because she learned that his right hand man was in fact her former lover.  In fact, the man she still loved, but who had treated her badly.  So, she marries him to enact her revenge on her ex.  And that is just the beginning of the nastiness that people inflict on one another in this film.
There are so many stunning moments in the film.  There is, of course, her rendition of ""Put the Blame on Mame.""  There is an unbelievable strip scene which is not merely one of the sexiest scenes in the history of film but one of the least revealing, for, in the end, her ""strip"" consists of removing a single glove.
The narrative of the film breaks down a bit near the end of the film, keeping the movie just short of complete perfection.  But that really isn't all that bad, since this film is mainly a study in the dynamics between three people.  And thanks to Hayworth, Ford, and Maccready, that love triangle is, at every point, a thing of extreme fascination.  Special mention should also be made of the excellent supporting role played by the Joseph Calleia, as the police detective.
The great irony of the film is that while it was Hayworth's greatest triumph, it was also the last truly great film in her career.  Although she was excellent in A LADY FROM SHANGHAI just a couple of years after this one, virtually all her best roles came before GILDA.  But even if she made no other films than this one, GILDA alone was enough to guarantee that she would always be remembered as one of the most beautiful and sensual actresses in the movies.",1016064000,4,2549,4.476190476190476
1369423,4,B00004XPPK,"""Gilda"" is the most misogynistic Hollywood film you'll ever see. It portrays social and business relationships among men as honorable and equitable -- regardless of which side of the law the men are on -- with women constantly trying to corrupt those relationships. The film repeatedly spells out -- without subtlety or ambiguity -- that women are poison.
Gilda ""ought"" to end with everyone dead, but Johnny and Gilda finally realize they have no good reason to hate each other, and walk off into the sunset. It's almost plausible, but the sudden cleaning-up of their dirty characters -- in which our faces have been rubbed for the preceding 100 minutes -- isn't believable. This is surprising in a script that's notable for its brilliant, multi-layered writing.
The principals -- Hayworth, Ford, Macready -- are terrific. Ford -- whom we tend to think of as playing nice guys -- brings a believably nasty, amoral ""edge"" to the part.
The DVD is very good, but not great. Although the transfer is a restoration sponsored by Sony, more than a few scenes are dark and a bit muddy. Don't expect quality up to, say, the recent ""Citizen Kane.""",1014595200,3,1137,4.835897435897436

1369427,4,B00004XPPK,"Gilda has the defining elements of film noir. The cinematographic feel,- see the first shot w/camera rising from BELOW ground to the gritty street bar scene. Great B and W .And of course the deadly female who is irresistable and foments catastrophe while she stirs the hormones ( well,doesnt beladonna mean beautiful lady/ also toxic plant). The homosexual subtext woven into film in a Hollywood where homoerotic doings (e.g. Cukor,Bankhead) were certainly more accepted, even celebrated,then we used to know as kids. The crisp, snap- brim fedora dialogue of the prowlers of  moral demi-monde of casinos( think ""Casablanca."")Remember when casino gambling was a top ten ""ooh-ah"" vice, before today's drug doings!) The movie writers have clever fun with the actors, who clearly enjoyed themselvers and each other. Recall, Ford played babyfaced nice guys until this one. Rita was a formulaic Colombia dancer/glamor queen of Cover Girl before. Moments to savor: Hair toss entrance by Rita. "" Me, 'decent'? Ford to Macready his casino boss: Your little friend (the boss's wicked cane sword) is female. Why: because it looks like one thing and then changes before your eyes."" Some things are dated but funny in a way. The Buenos Aires government gumshoe is holding off arresting Macready character, a shady gambler, murderer and mob leader,so he can get Macready's ring on-get this now-"" antitrust violations."" Wow, anti- trust violations..Gotta love it in the context of history... Anyway if you want three movies to show the grandkids what noir was,IMO try 1) Gilda, 2) Brute Force (on VHS), and 3) Maltese Falcon. For pure fun and a sly depth I think Gilda is arguably the best and most entertaining to own and keep. Aloha, Gerry",1004227200,2,1726,5.098939929328622
1369428,4,B00004XPPK,"I've made the mistake of only thinking of Rita Hayworth as a pin up model, in the tradition of Betty Grable. I knew Rita Hayworth was famous, but I just thought she was known for her looks. When I first saw ""Gilda"" I realized there was more to her than meets the eye. She was a talented actress. And to many filmbuffs she will always remain as ""Gilda"".
 ""Gilda"" starts out with Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford) working for a casino owner,Ballin Mundson (George Macready). They both try to make sure the money comes in, but never leaves. Soon Mundson goes out of town, leaving Johnny in charge, when he returns, Johnny finds out that Mundson not only brought a woman back with him, but, he's married! Now, this goes against their rule of woman don't mix with gambling. But, there's more to it than just that. Gilda and Johnny don't seem to get along. And soon Mundson gets a bit suspicious as why these two hate each other so much. He finds out they were lovers! This has turned Johnny into a broken man and has turned Gilda into a lush who feels no love for any man.
 ""Gilda"" was many highpoints that make this a must to watch. First there's Hayworth's acting. Macready as usual is entertaining to watch as the villian, something he was use to playing. And the directing by Charles Vidor isn't bad either. But, the one real reason you have to watch this movie is for Hayworth's dance to ""Put the Blame on Mame"", and the guitar version. Plus everyone seems to have forgotten there was another song in this movie that was very attractive, ""Amado Mio"". A great noir film, with lots of style!",1003017600,,1583,4.455172413793103

She made two amazing films that truly showed what she could do with a few lines of dialogue and facial expressions that could a room ablaze. ""Gilda"" and its equal ""The Lady From Shanghai"" show off her talent in top form! In this Noir Hayworth is Gilda a smart, sexy and devlish woman who marries for money but seduces for kicks. The plot is a love triangle at its best due to the fact that the main characters Haywoth, Ford and Mundson all want lust and money! When the unlucky Farrell played to perfection by Glenn Ford is saved in a sedy alley by a sinister and scarred Mundson (Macready as the devil himself) Farrell soon learns that Mudson owns the hottest night club in town and the hottest woman - Gilda! But thing are not as they seem and when the film goes into Noit overdrive the viewer is rewarded with master shots of kissing, over the shoulder slaps and just plain shoot outs! Gilda is the ultimate film about greed and how it controls not you bu the people around you. The films dialouge is so slick that you might want to bring some of the slang into your everyday venacular! If ""The Lady From Shanghai"" turned Hayworth into the ultimate ice queen then Gilda paints her as the utlimate piece of ice sculpture! Beautiful, clear but not clear enough that the you can see clearly through it but as with ice and as with the film's heroin Gilda and its chracters have the ultimate meltdown and just our luck its for our own pleasure to watch it happen!",1001635200,7,1531,4.394366197183099

But there are some moments in film that make a movie worth a million bucks for that shining few seconds. And Rita Hayworth's Put the Blame on Mame number is that classic moment that can never ever be forgotten. Its an image that has rocked the world for almost sixty years. And somewhere out there are still many weary old men who still feel a faint stirring when they think about that satin doll. I suspect it will be that way for generations to come.",999129600,,531,4.267326732673268
1369432,5,B00004XPPK,"This all-time classic is loaded with fierce passion and sheer beauty. About passion, after seeing it you'll give some thought to one of the key phrases uttered in it: ""Hate is a very exciting emotion... haven't you noticed?"". Powerful jealousy, obsession, flirtation and double crossing are the order of the day, and some domestic violence between Gilda and Jhonny doesn't go unnoticed (famous slapping). I had seen Gilda a few times before on TV, but seeing it again thanks to this DVD gave me some new surprises. Among those, a scene that made me think of Sharon Stone's most polemic one in Basic Instinct! Gilda is in her room getting ready for her party at the casino, and right after she stands up from the sofa and turns around with her beautiful gown... well, sorry, you have to see the movie. Besides the photography being so incredibly beautiful, Rita is... well, Rita of course. Only her beauty can describe her beauty. I had the opinion that the most gorgeous close-ups of Rita Hayworth appeared in the movie ""Salome"" (a technicolor one). After watching Gilda again I succumbed to Rita's B&W close-ups. You may put the blame on Mame ;-), I think very few claims of beauty and seduction on the big screen can match Rita Hayworth in Gilda. Extremely recommended.",998611200,2,1271,4.781818181818182
1369433,5,B00004XPPK,"Though Rita Hayworth's sultry performance steals each scene in which she's featured, it is overall an excellent movie.  Never before or since has a femme fatale been portrayed with such smoldering passion and such deep character flaws as Hayworth's Gilda.  Combine her potency with a plot involving an illegal gambling operation with plenty of shady characters ~ in fact, every character has an ulterior motive and a secret ~ and you have a film that, after 60 years, is still fascinating to watch.",996105600,,498,4.9879518072289155
1369434,5,B00004XPPK,"This artificial melodrama is only redeemed by the absorbing performances of its lead actors. Set in the Argentine, along a backdrop of gambling casinos, illicit trade and international intrigue, it portrays an American gambler (Glenn Ford) who is enlisted to become the right-hand-man of a powerful casino owner. He is struck by the fact that his new boss's wife, Gilda, is an old flame of his, a sensuous, enigmatic and manupulative ""femme fatale"", played by the sex bomb of the 1940s, Rita Hayworth. The story develops along a pattern of a love triangle sustained by reciprocal hate, love and domination as the trio dramatically pit their wits against each other. The dialogue sparkles once managed by these actors and in this style. Hayworth is captivating as Gilda, perhaps her most accomplished performance. Ford is also good as the gambler promoted by the boss to casino top-dog, though the honours also have to go to George Macready as the the husband and boss, the ice-cold, self-possessed, aristocratic type. The character actors, particularly Joseph Calleia and Stevan Geray, provide excellent support.

""Gilda"" as such did impress me less by its contents, but I was completely fascinated by the beauty and sex-appeal of the ravishing beautiful Rita Hayworth. One ca really feel her charisma and sensuality and it shows clearly, why men at that time were completely bewitched by her. In ""Gilda"" she appears so seductive sexy , so temperamental and yet so unapproachable in her beauty.

TITLE:  Gilda (1946)  NR  1:50:11
  Rita Hayworth, Glenn Ford, George Macready, Joseph Calleia
  Charles Vidor (Director)

  The movie in which Rita Hayworth set the vast majority of male hearts aflutter in 1946  and that also cemented the public's perception of her as an international sex symbol. And, this movie is also the most likely reason that her personal relationships with men and her marriages were all troubled and, ultimately, all failed  guys couldn't separate Rita Hayworth, the real-life woman, from ""Gilda"", the character she played in the movie.

  Now, setting aside all of the off-screen Rita Hayworth baggage: this is still a VERY good movie. It is a well-written, well-directed, well-acted (by everyone involved) example of a pitch-perfect psychological drama at its best  that also has a goodly number of film noir attributes. Most of the important noir staples are here: the loner ""tough guy"", with a dark past (Johnny Farrell [Glenn Ford]); the beautiful damsel-in-distress/femme-fatal, with an even darker dark past (Gilda [Rita Hayworth]); the menacing criminal figure, who threatens them both (Ballin Mundson [George Macready]); the collection of shady (but, colorful) characters (Maurice Obregon [Joseph Calleia], Uncle Pio [Steven Geray], Casey [Joe Sawyer], etc.); and, (probably the MOST important film noir staple of them ALL) the fact that NOTHING and NO ONE is as they seem. Take all of this and couple it with the neurotic love/hate relationship  and the palpable sexual tension  of the two main characters (Gilda and Johnny Farrell), and you have yourself a very good film, ladies and gentlemen! Highly recommended.

VIDEO:  1.33:1  B&W  480p  MPEG-2 (5.3 Mbps)

  Within the confines of the DVD format, this film exhibits good, to  on some occasions  very good, picture quality. Also, sharpness and detail (for a DVD) are usually good (with the textures and patterns of most hair-styles, clothing and furnishings being readily discernible)  but, the movie did (in a limited number of scenes) present an image that was slightly soft. In addition, artifacts such as black specks and white dots (while no where near excessive) are visible in a few scenes. Lastly, contrast, gray scale and shadow-detail (while pretty good overall [for a DVD]) were downright ""murky"" in some scenes. Overall, this movie's presentation on DVD has mostly good, to sometimes very good, picture quality  and, should satisfy all but the pickiest of viewers

AUDIO:  Dolby Digital 2.0 (Dual-Mono, 48 KHz, 192 Kbps)

  The sound quality for this film's transfer fairs better than its picture quality, because there are no loud bumps nor objectionably high levels of hiss. Also, dialog is very clear and all voices are easily understood. However, dynamic range is very limited, and there is not much bottom-end nor any top-end to speak of (which makes the musical score, the nightclub numbers and the Foley work all sound a little 'thin', and somewhat less than realistic). Otherwise, considering the age of the source elements and the fact that this is a monophonic, dialog-driven movie from the mid 1940s, its audio presentation has more than acceptable sound quality.
