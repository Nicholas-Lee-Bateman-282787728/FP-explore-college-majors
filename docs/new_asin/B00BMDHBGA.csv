5647171,1,B00BMDHBGA,"I'm still trying to figure out why this disk is entitled ""Best Evidence: Top 10 UFO Sightings"" when there isn't even ONE person who admits to seeing UFO No. 7, Robert Salas' Malmstrom AFB hoax.  Have UFOlogists bounced so far out of the real world that they no longer require an eye-witness to define a ""UFO Sighting""?  As for ""Best Evidence"" -- wow!  Shouldn't you be required to provide some form of ""evidence"" first?

If Robert Salas' silly little UFO story represents ""Best Evidence"", then there is truly something miscommunicated around here; the leading UFO Researchers in the world who selected these stories have most definitely neglected even the basest bit of research to confirm the claims he has made, an unfortunate characteristic of UFOlogy in general these days.  Sadly, it's the result of Salas' (and apparently Kimball's) refusal to accept the claims of the only two people who were present at Echo Flight, one of two incidents Salas has tried to establish:  Eric Carlson, the commander of Echo Flight, and Walt Figel, his deputy commander. Both men have repeatedly asserted that UFOs were not involved with those events in 1967. There's not a word of truth to any of the claims he has authored.  You are welcome to believe whatever you like, but Robert Salas, author of ""Faded Giant"", has been repeatedly accused of lying about and-slash-or embellishing details of these incidents by those military veterans who served their nation well during the hottest period of the Vietnam War and the coldest of the Cold War.  And those accusations have been repeatedly proven.

If you wish to know exactly what happened in 1967, and why the missiles at Echo Flight actually failed, and why the Oscar Flight claims (Salas' second case) are so pointless, I encourage you to examine without cost the narratives by James Carlson at scribd-dot-com (all are www; don't forget slashes):

I would also recommend that you examine the numerous interviews and articles at the Reality Uncovered website: realityuncovered.net.  Many of the articles discuss the events at Echo Flight and Oscar Flight in March 1967, and include interviews with both the commander and the deputy commander at Echo Flight on March 16, 1967. To this day, Robert Salas insists that both men confirm his claims of UFO interference, which both men deny strongly. He refuses entirely to discuss these matters in detail or answer any questions regarding the testimonies of these two men, preferring instead to attack the integrity and credibility of those publically raising such issues. He refuses to offer anything substantial in the way of evidence, and fails entirely to explain the details of his claims or to answer any of the valid questions raised by his insistence. What he has done is rely on the craven use of blatant lies and baseless insults in regard to his critics without once managing to refute or even discuss their criticisms, while refusing to answer necessary questions regarding his numerous, proven lies, and has neglected as well to defend his own theories against numerous accusations of massive fraud and profiteering on a scale UFO proponent communities have only rarely been subjected to.

A lot information regarding this incident can be found at the Reality Uncovered forum, in particular the Echo Flight Incident thread: realityuncovered.net-slash-forum-slash-viewtopic.php?f=19&t=1688&sid=fb3fd24f098c0f3bc35595ea1b41a146.  Every single detail, digression, discussion or subject of argument asserted by both men has been explained and discussed in great detail in the documents and on the websites you've been directed to. Not one question has been left unanswered, a statement that Salas cannot honestly affirm. He has created fiction and called it fact, something anyone willing to actually do the research can determine very readily for himself, as the events -- contrary to Salas' claims -- have been declassified since before 1980.

Tim Hebert, an ex-USAF missileer himself, has also written some enlightening articles regarding the case on his blog at: timhebert.blogspot.com.  You should take the time to read them.

Dr. David Clarke, for many years an accepted expert regarding the British military forces' investigations of the UFO phenomenon, has also discussed this case in the context of the ""UFO and Nukes"" connection asserted by researcher Robert Hastings. You can read his article on the subject at drdavidclarke.blogspot.com-slash-2010-slash-11-slash-flat-earth-nukes.html.

The folk tales currently being spread by Salas have not merely been dismissed as one possible interpretation of his claims; they have been repeatedly dismantled and shredded -- proven as lies by witness testimony and documented evidence. There is no doubt whatsoever that he created this case outright. There were no UFOs involved -- it is a lie, and nothing more. Witnesses that Salas has discussed to the public have actually come forward to dispute the claims hehas made. They insist that their statements were taken out of context and distorted purposely in order to suggest the presence of UFOs where no such presence could otherwise be established. Salas has perpetrated a UFO hoax of the worst sort, and has attempted to destroy the reputations and career service of better men than himself.

The commander of Echo Flight on March 16, 1967, CAPT (Ret.) Eric D. Carlson (my father), has released the following definitive statement:

""Let me start by stating that, as best as I can recall, my only contact with Salas and Hastings has been on the phone. I did tell Salas that he could release my name to whomever he wished, don't know why he needed my permission. I have talked to a newspaper writer in Great Falls, several years age, and a TV producer from one of those UFO shows. With both these individuals I denied any knowledge of any UFO's at Malmstrom. In addition, I stated that there was no, repeat no, incident at Oscar flight as Salas maintains. The man is either lying or delusional.

""My only contact with Hastings was a call I received from him regarding his book. I stated that his book sounded interesting and he later sent me a copy which I read and gave away .... At no time did I mention anyone's mental status; yours, mine, his, or Salas', although in retrospect I could comment on Salas'.

""My memory is quite good regarding the events at Malmstrom and there is no doubt in my mind that there were no reports of UFO's and no incident at Oscar flight. I will be willing to discuss this with anyone who is truly interested in the facts.""

His deputy commander at Echo Flight, COL (Ret.) Walter Figel, Jr., has insisted as well that UFOs were not involved, and adds that his version of this event has been distorted by both Robert Salas and Robert Hastings in order to give the impression that an actual UFO was involved. He asserts very strongly that no UFOs were involved, nor were UFOs ever reported.  Walt Figel has released numerous comments regarding the incidents of March 1967, including the following definitive statement:

""James,

""First - your dad has not lied about anything nor do believe that he is even capable of lying about anything at all. He was, is, and always will be an honorable man. You should remember that always - I will.

""Second - Bob Salas was never associated with any shutdown of any missiles at any time in any flight and you can take that to the bank. Just think about this for a split second. He is a person wrapped up in UFOs to the Nth degree. Yet he could not remember he was not at Echo. Then he thought he was at November - wrong again. Then he thought he was at Oscar - wrong again.

""Third - There is no record about anything happening at November or Oscar except in people's minds that are flawed beyond imagination. Salas has created events out of the thin air and can't get the facts straight even then. My best friend to this day was the flight commander of the 10th SMS at the time. He and I have discussed this silly assertion in the past couple of years - he thinks it is all madeup nonsense for sure. I put both Salas and Hastings in touch with him and he has told them both that an incident at November or Oscar never happened. In addition he was subsequently stationed at Norton AFB where the engineers tested the possible problems. No little green men were responsible.

""Fourth - I have always maintained that I do not nor have I ever believed that UFOs exist in any form at any place at any time. I have never seen one or reported that I have seen one. I have always maintained that they had nothing to do with the shutdown of Echo flight in Montana.

""Fifth - The event at Malmstrom has a hand written log from me that was turned in just like all the other logs that I wrote over several years. I would think that if I wrote something like that in the log, there would be copies, it would have been classified at the beginning and then released along with the classified SAC messages and base reports. Nothing in that urgent SAC message even hints of UFOs at all and I think that it would if the official logs or telephone calls had referenced that fact.

""Sixth - When it happened, neither your dad nor I were ""visibly shaken"" by the events. It was just another day with a unexpected event in our lives. It was rather underwhelming at the time. No one rushed out to see us, no one made us sign any papers, no one interrogated us for hours on end.

""There is no Air Force ""cover-up"" [of the events of March 1967]; it just did not happen the way Salas and has portrayed the course of events. I am sorry that you are all caught up in a pissing contest with these people, I really am. They are just not going to let go no matter what you say or do. He has made a 15 year career pandering about the country talking about things he has no knowledge about. I am not at all interested in taking them on - it's not worth my effort - I have more important things to do with my life. I much rather just stay out of it.

""Hopefully, we can move on. I did read about a briefing on the 27th here in DC. I am here in VA about 10 miles away. Interesting. Hopefully this helps you and confirms to you at least that your dad is a straight shooter and does not lie to anyone.""

Robert Salas' commander at Oscar Flight, Frederick Meiwald, insists that he doesn't even believe in UFOs -- a strange comment to make in light of Salas' insistence that a UFO took out the missiles at Oscar Flight during an incident that resulted in an injury to one non-commissioned officer, requiring that man to be evacuated from the site by helicopter. When interviewed by Robert Hastings, he stated unequivocably that he doesn't remember anything at all about a UFO. In fact, Robert Hastings himself has written:

""Meiwald then elaborated and said that he couldn't support everything Salas has said about the incident because he had been resting-slash-sleeping when the first missile or two dropped offline --- which occurred moments after Salas received a report from the Oscar Flight Security Controller about a UFO hovering over the Launch Control Facility's front gate.

""Although Salas had quickly told Meiwald about that telephone conversation, Meiwald says that he can't remember it.""

In another interview conducted by Hastings, Meiwald is equally clear:

""RH: Okay. Now, when Bob, I think moments [after] he woke you up, or you got up and sat down at the commander's consol--he of course had received a call from the Flight Security Controller, saying that there was a bright red, oval-shaped object hovering over the security fence gate--my understanding is that is what he told you as soon as you were at your consol, that he had received this call and, uh, that of course coincided with the missiles beginning to malfunction. Do you recall him telling you that?

""FM: I really don't remember that portion of it, relative to the bright object. I remember an unusual condition [but] as far as the details, uh, I can't elaborate on that.""

The following exchange is also revealing:

""RH: Okay. He of course has also said that you two were, uh, when you were back at Malmstrom, you were debriefed by OSI and required to sign non-disclosure statements. Do you remember that?

""FM: I remember being directed to do that. But that was no problem. I've been one of these people, when told to forget something, I forget it--eventually [inaudible].

""RH: Right, well, is that a polite way of saying that you really don't want to discuss this, even though you know more than you're saying?

""FM: No, I'm saying I don't remember.""

For nearly ten years Salas was using Meiwald as confirmation of the events at both November Flight and Oscar Flight, stating that either my father or someone else called Meiwald on March 16 and told him all about Echo Flight. When interviewed by Hastings, Meiwald stated, ""Whatever happened over at Echo, I have no idea."" He has rebuffed completely the attempts by Hastings and Salas to establish confirmation for the UFOs they've invented.

Meiwald has also clearly stated in other interviews with Salas that only 3-4 missiles failed during the one missile failures event he has recalled; he's NEVER stated outright that the UFO story he told Salas in 1996 had anything at all to do with missile failures; it's never even been mentioned in context.

My father, the commander of Echo Flight in March 1967, was present when all ten missiles were taken off of strategic alert by an electronic noise pulse generated internally at the launch control facility. This pulse interfered with the normal operation of the logic coupler on the guidance and control module for that facility, causing thereby the failure of the missiles, which were, in effect, simply turned off. The incident was very well documented and was thoroughly investigated, and every word that Robert Salas and Robert Hastings have ever said on the subject has been repeatedly discounted or proven outright to be little more than lies and embellishments created for the purpose of making money from the sales of their books, the sales of associated videos, and the speaking fees they charge as a matter of course when retelling their ridiculous little folk tales.

I'm not asking you to believe these points I've outlined. It isn't necessary, as they're already included in the public record and can be examined by anyone who's interested in the subject. I do ask, however, that you give some further thought to claims you've discussed. You should be aware that there is another point of view in regard to this matter -- one that has been repeatedly confirmed by those men who were actually involved with this singular event in USAF history, has been very well-documented through the years, and was very thoroughly investigated by the USAF for some months after the incident itself.

There were only two witnesses at Echo Flight in March 1967: the commander of the flight, CAPT Eric D. Carlson, and the deputy commander, COL Walter Figel, Jr. Both men have publically affirmed that there was no UFO. Robert Salas and Robert Hastings are both merely agitators -- one a liar and the other a fraud -- who have repeatedly misrepresented the claims of the men involved in these incidents. They started utilizing these methods years ago, found out that it made their claims convincing to a few ignorant people, and continued this path of slander and disruption as a result of their minor and isolated successes. They are petty con-men and fraudulent hucksters -- nothing more.

If this one section of Kimball's documentary is in any way similar to the other cases discussed, then he has produced a film unworthy of being described as non-fiction.  In fact, the description associated with Salas above as an ""actor"" instead of a ""witness"" is appropriate.  It's unfortunately the only element of Salas' claims as portrayed in this ""documentary"" that can be called ""appropriate"".  For the most part, it's a collection of lies and irresponsibility.

Most sincerely,
James Carlson

There are FAR better pictures and film / video  to clearly make the case, but they are sadly not here.

5647247,5,B00BMDHBGA,Awesome documentary. I love information about UFO's I actually saw one in 1977 while at the University with a bunch of other college friends. We were not intoxicated either :) Being a pilot I reported it to Flight Service Station at the local airport. They had no reports previously. It was amazing. Wish I had a camera. Video cameras were too bulky and expensive back then but would have been nice to have had one of those as well for proof. But was an excellent flick.

It does not matter that most of the researchers represented are convinced that beings from other planets are visiting us in structured craft. There is arguably little proof of this besides our cultural bias and preconceptions about the subject. The point made is that there is a solid body of evidence that strongly suggests that we have been dealing with something that appears intelligent (at least in the manner we consider it) whose origin is as yet unknown and which makes itself visible to us from time to time.

The cases presented in ""Best Evidence"" should make any reasonable person consider the case for a non-human origin for many of the more well-documented UFO cases throughout the centuries. This is a great introduction for anyone who has had little exposure to the sincere and sober side of a subject that is routinely ridiculed.",1365033600,5,1032,4.792134831460674
5647250,4,B00BMDHBGA,"Paul Kimball's Best Evidence is a great overview of 10 UFO cases which deserve wider attention.  Whatever one's opinion of any of the individual cases Kimball selected, this documentary provides excellent starting points for discussion and investigation.  The documentary (and the cases are listed in other reviews here on the page) does not fall into the usual UFO documentary trap of telling the viewer what to believe or what is ""true.""  Rather, the film provides a starting point for further exploration and investigation into these cases.  Will they all hold water under intense scrutiny?  Perhaps not--but that is part of the journey.

It's not a perfect film.  The narration is, in particular, a bit slowly paced for my liking.  This, of course, is a minor complaint.

The film is a great starting point for those who want to know more about the vast mystery of UFO sightings but have been burned out (or just plain burned) by the endless retreads of Roswell, et al.

I should also note the excellent extras, including the incredible ""Fields of Fear"" documentary, which concerns the phenomenon of cattle mutilations.  The value for price here is really good.

Overall, this set is a great addition to any UFO buff's library.",1364947200,3,1231,4.951219512195122
5647251,4,B00BMDHBGA,"[Spoiler alert: I list the Top 10 cases within this review]

Most of us have sat through those awful mainstream television documentaries on UFOs, Bigfoot and various other mysteries. The faces of interviewees barely discernable through the heavy shadows, the terrible faux X-Files soundtrack, and a breathy voiceover issued three octaves below normal pitch. And, as the final indignity, if the viewer is able to sit through the torture of all that, they are usually subjected to the opinion of some pseudo-skeptic at the end admonishing us all for taking an interest in the topic. Thankfully, this review is about something completely different.

Canadian director/producer Paul Kimball is a man who knows ufology. While he may not be a favourite with many notables in the UFO research community - due to his tendency to state what he thinks of various theories, cases and personalities quite openly - he does know the history behind the topic very well, and brings a natural skepticism as well (without being a debunking zealot). Indeed, one could hardly think of a better person to produce a definitive documentary about the best UFO sightings to this point.

Well, happy times are here, because Kimball has done exactly that with this documentary. Though perhaps lacking in the type of big budget provided to features such as the Peter Jennings special 'Seeing is Believing', the methodology, knowledge and intellectual honesty of the Best Evidence team makes this documentary stand out above those big budget efforts.

Instead of picking the top ten cases on their apparent 'sellability' - eg. Roswell - Kimball surveyed the experts in the field for their opinion on the best ever cases (based on evidence, reliability and number of witnesses etc). Notables such as Karl Pflock, Nick Redfern, Stanton Friedman, Richard Hall, Don Ledger, Kevin Randall (amongst many others) all put forth their opinion, and the resulting top ten will probably surprise many who aren't conversant with ufological history (most especially, television executives!). No trace of Roswell. No Adamski photo. No Phoenix Lights. So what's left?

The list, in short:

  #10: Nuremberg, 1561
  #9: Skylab III
  #8: Yukon 'mothership'
  #7: Malstrom AFB
  #6: Shag Harbour
  #5: Kelly Johnson
  #4: McMinnville/Trent Photo
  #3: Rendlesham Forest
  #2: Iran, 1976
  #1: RB-47

The 45 minutes of Best Evidence is pretty much all devoted to analysis and discussion of these ten cases...no lead-up hype, no philosophical meandering. Just an outline of each case, intermixed with excellent interview footage with ufological luminaries such as Stanton Friedman, Nick Pope and Brad Sparks (again, amongst others), and actual 'experiencers' such as Robert Salas (Malstrom) and Charles Halt (Rendlesham).

This is an excellent exposition of a number of cases which will - in my opinion - leave the lay viewer with their mouth agape, wondering how orthodox science can get away with dismissing 'true' ufology as some sort of joke. Cases such as Rendlesham, Shag Harbour and the 1996 Yukon sighting, with multiple reliable witnesses, can only invoke an astonished response from anyone not already conversant with the details of the cases.

Nevertheless, while the 'straight' exposition works well in presenting the evidence behind each case, it would still have been nice to hear some of the balancing 'skeptical' arguments to each case, as well as having some of the bigger philosophical questions addressed. When the Kelly Johnson case was presented, my reaction was to wonder what sort of coincidence would allow for both aeronautical design genius Kelly Johnson, and members of his team elsewhere aboard an aircraft, to make independent sightings of the same UFO - does this argue for some sort of government psy-op, or does it argue for some sort of ufological intelligence directing itself towards these scientists working in such a related field? Similarly, when UFOs dive underwater and make a beeline for an advanced submarine detection base, what can we read from the situation? These questions are not addressed at all, although I think this was actually intentional - in effect, let the viewer make up their own mind, rather than forcefeed them an explanation (although I did note habitual use of the extraterrestrial meme, in comments such as 'out of this world', 'mothership' etc).

Also, it would have been nice to see the locales in which the cases took place, and a few more of the primary witnesses, to give the viewer a better sense of 'gestalt' of each case. However, I have no doubt this is more related to budgetary concerns than Kimball overlooking such an option - travelling with a crew in tow is notoriously expensive, and it must be remembered that Best Evidence is not a primetime mainstream television feature. Certainly, I bring this up only as a minor comment, not any sort of catastrophic flaw in the film.

Barring the above criticisms, Best Evidence is a wonderful documentary. Special effects vary from average, such as in the Kelly Johnson case, to excellent - the Trent case is done beautifully with moving footage morphing into the photo. One surprise is the narration, provided by Canadian actress Kris Lee McBride, which turns the worn out cliche of deep and breathy narration in UFO documentaries on its head. Although at times McBride seems a little stiff in her presentation - at points you can almost hear her reading the script - for the most part, the rational/logical vibe of the female voiceover works extremely well (similar to the use of female narration in British documentaries - Horizon's Dilly Barlow is a close comparison). More experience at narration, and also perhaps with ufology itself, will no doubt serve McBride well over time, giving her the confidence to use her voice to its full advantage.

The interviews with ufologists and experiencers are shot beautifully, and for me were the central focus of Best Evidence. Not having the access to conferences and events that some do, it's always a pleasure for me to watch the experts explain their point of view - and Kimball gives them plenty of chance to do so. Friedman brings gravitas as well as some theatre with his wonderfully intoned comments, Brad Sparks speaks with a knowledge of ufological history as well as technical nous, and the late Mac Tonnies offers a wonderful concluding comment to the documentary.

A worthy purchase for a solid exploration of some of the more fascinating UFO cases.
