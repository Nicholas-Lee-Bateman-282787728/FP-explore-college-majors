8233966,3,B000YRY7X0,"The movie's a waste, the reproduction quality is pretty good, though. OK, so out of curiosity I purchased this film to see what the hype was all about. Three women (one a lesbian, one having dreams about a roll in the hay with Forman Shane, and the other looking like a pasty-faced blonde Barbie doll) and a guy are being stalked and two out of the three former are tortured and eventually killed, leaving the lesbian and the guy alone. All this happens when the group's airplane is shot down out of the sky by a twisted mountain man known as ""The Bushwhacker."" The plot of the story is a good idea but the acting stinks.  With the exception of Forman Shane (Harvey Shain), with whom I had the pleasure of meeting with Stephen Apostolof (king of sexploitation) in the 70s, everyone needs some serious acting lessons. Forman Shane was about the only one that acted with at least SOME knowledge of how to perform; the women basically whined and the Bushwhacker....well, I have nothing to say about him, he just did not make sense.  A little teasing eye candy for the guys is on tap here (although I saw absolutely NOTHING physically attractive about these women except they had the same lovely bodies that I once had).  In the face department.....zero.  Forman Shane is not only handsome but for me carried much hot sex appeal with his cute baby face and toned physique (BUT HE KEPT HIS PANTS ON!!!!!!).  A little touch of gore here and there, unheard of back then until Herschell Gordon Lewis came on the scene later on with his ""Blood"" movies, during the torture sequences, but as I watched I scratched my head and said, ""Really....?""  So if you have nothing better to do like watch a ceiling fan go round and round, then round up some popcorn and waste time watching this.",1406160000,,1773,4.559748427672956
8233967,1,B000YRY7X0,"I should've trusted his judgement.  Far from a ""Something Weird""-esque classic, this is a complete bore.  It's filmed like an episode of The Monkees, but with no jokes.  Even the nudity is boring.  BORING BORING BORING!",1249084800,,219,5.0

While it unspooled on my entertainment system, I became very aware of an unsightly stain on my Berber carpet. Reaching for a long disused bottle of stain remover gathering cobwebs under my bathroom sink, I began to apply the solution to the effected area, followed by a gentle massage with a damp rag. The stain was gone. Fifteen minutes went by until I noticed another unsightly stain along the perimeter of my couch. Liberally dousing the area, I began to scrub my living room floor for highly satisfactory results. Thirty minutes into the feature, I became cognizant of some unsightly stains in between the tiles of my bathroom shower and reached for a proven tub and tile cleanser.

The story? A macho pilot and three not-that-pretty girls survive a plane crash and are stranded in the California wilderness. They walk around a lot. Eventually, ""the Bushwhacker,"" a demented mountain man with a raccoon hat covering up his bald spot begins to spy on them. The pilot and the girls walk around some more. The Bushwhacker watches them. The pilot and one of the girls have sort-of sex. They walk around some more. There's some mild lesbian groping. They walk around some more. The Bushwhacker watches them some more. The girls and the pilot stop to admire nature. They walk around some more. The Bushwhacker watches them through the foliage. The girls and the pilot wade in a nearby stream. The Bushwhacker watches them some more ....

Finally, one hour into the feature the Bushwhacker abducts a shapely brunette; there is some unconvincing bondage, beating, torture, murder and minor necrophilia. The pilot and surviving girls must fight for their lives, and there is a duel to the death, and - I began to scrub my kitchen windows by then, so I'm still not sure how it eventually turned out.

We'll cut to the chase. The Bushwhacker is seen by some as the death rattle of the ""roughie,"" an exploitation staple that lathered up scenes of nudity and sex with violence. The latest Something Weird catalog notes that very few prints of the film were made, giving The Bushwhacker an undeserved aura of being a long lost classic of perversity. No dice! This thing is strictly two steps removed from Coleman Francis' The Beast of Yucca Flats (1960) due to it being in color and sound. It may be three steps removed if we count breasts. Truly, it feels as if it took as long to make as it takes to watch. Seeing as screen slime vet Byron (The Defilers) Mabe stepped in to play the titular Bushwhacker in addition to helming this monstrosity, it's not hard to assume that the entire cast and crew consisted of the girls, the pilot, Mabe and maybe a cameraman. Minimalist and amateur in the extreme, the end credits are written with felt pin on distaff pieces of paper.

The Bushwhacker does have redeeming value in that it will give the most apathetic couch potato thinking of all the other things they could be doing in lieu of watching it. As for myself, I never before realized the buildup of grease at the bottom of my oven ...",1208217600,8,3113,4.675182481751825
