The acting is bad, over the top, and exagerated. The effects are disgusting and annoying. The landscapes are beautiful. The story is silly.

But you can't help but like this film, even though everything seems do have been so wrong and messy. And Coralina Cataldi-Tassoni's over acting is a bonus here and fits the movie well. I like her!

1006381,4,6305281483,"First off, if you don't like low budget ""B"" Horror films, and like to nit pick every little mistake in a movie, don't bother with this one...but for those of you who like gore and cult horror movies..here's one for you.

This movie follows a vacationing couple, who pick up a strange woman on the back roads. They soon realize there's something not right about her...and she has her own plans for them. Leading them deep into the woods, it soon grows dark and she turns on them. She turns into a hideous demon with a claw in her crotch, and starts killing...her victims then turning into demons themselves.

This movie, like I said, is a low budget film, with some not so good acting & dubbing, but it is very creepy in an Evil Dead sort of way, there's an ample amount of gore, and some creepy effects..its definitely worth checking out if you like Evil Dead. Now, of course, I'm not saying this movie is as good as Evil Dead, but there is a similarity to it. Demons. Gore. Dark Woods. Creepy Sounds & Setting. Check it out...its a great cult film.",1157414400,,1049,4.402061855670103
1006382,1,6305281483,"Italian director Andreas Marfori made his directorial debut with Evil Clutch back in the late 80s, a film that offered some fairly decent gore, but some really dumb scenes, especially when it came down to revealing the monster. The story follows a couple passing through  a small italian town,where they meet up with a nice woman and the strange locals, whom warn the couple of the true intentions of the woman. Nturally when locals warn outsiders about somethingthen it's probably true, and once again, int this caseit is,as it turns out that the woman is actually a monster whom seduces the men with her beautiful looks then turns into a beast that has a demon hand that bursts out of the woman's  private parts to grab the men  in the genitals. If that wasn't bad enough, we're subjected to the cheesy special eefects. The movie really drags in the first half since not much happens and we're given a lot of scenes essentially about nothing. There even a sequence involving a man telling a seemlingly pointless horror story to the outsiders,probably to use up the the extra running time. Around the second half the film picks up when the woman tries to seduce our lead, resulting in a lot of running and screaming. ON the plus side the gore is pretty decent , and the film can be violent at times. It's clear that director Andreas ripped off Evil Dead films when it came to seeong through the eyes of the invisible evil entity that would fly through the wooded  area, they even managed to replicate the sound effect. Aside from the gore,the movie is pretty much a waste of time. A real bore fest that likes to rip off Evil Dead just to make it self look better. It does not work and just adds one more reason why you should stay away from this film!",1144281600,,1752,4.517350157728707

1006384,1,6305281483,"This is an Italian film that made its way to the States through the renowned producers of B-movies, Troma.
Tragically, it doesn't display any  of the traits that one normally associates with Troma films. There is no  humour, no wacky characters, no real horror... in fact, all 'Evil Clutch'  presents a collection of examples on what NOT to do when making a movie.  (With one exception, the humour in 'Evil Clutch' is either unintentional,  or it falls flat. The only thing that comes close to a Troma moment  involves a pair of hands that get left on a rock.)
The story (such as it  is) is about a young couple who go leave the city behind for a quiet  vacation in the Italian Alps. After an encounter with a mysterious young  woman who claims to have been attacked and a self-described writer of  'supernatural stories,' they go camping in the woods. Naturally, they end  up being stalked by monsters.
A staple of *bad* B-movies are filler shots  of people walking along with spooky music playing for no reason, storylines  devoid of any logic, characters devoid of any common sense or personality,  and actors so bad that it makes one consider a career in the movies. 'Evil  Clutch' has all these in spades. Additionally, in this film we've to clumsy  attempts at foreshadowing and even clumsier attempts at copying scenes that  were done much better in other films.
After all that negativity, I  suppose I should point out the two things that recommend this video. First,  it has a nice score consisting of electronic music. It's just too bad that  said music plays at times that seem as unmotivated and inexplicable as the  actions of our heroes. Second, it's a video so it's possible for shuttle  past the entirely too long sequences of cars traveling along mountain roads  and the young couple (together or on their own) stumbling around in the  forest.
Spend your money on something else. You'll never be able to  reclaim the time it'll take you to watch 'Evil Clutch.'",966643200,2,1977,4.7105263157894735

1006522,2,6305281483,"A young, vacationing couple find themselves thrust into a nightmare world of supernatural insanity and gore. EVIL CLUTCH could be seen as an Italian-made homage film, dedicated to far superior movies like THE EVIL DEAD. Either that, or as a blatant rip-off thereof (ie., check out that swooping camera shot, running along the ground! Sound familiar?). The odd, overly ""mysterious"" story-line is just a lumbering skeleton to cover in the various blood, pus, and other goo. The couple are plagued by a demon in human form, and a strange, chatty man on a motorcycle. This allows for a few purposefully disgusting sequences w/ squishy special effects.  Actually, the worst aspect of EVIL CLUTCH, is the abysmally annoying couple themselves! Every time they open their mouths, it's like being smacked w/ a cactus! I wanted to jump into the screen, and assist in their hideous demise! Ugh! This causes the scenes in between massacres to be insufferably boring, and brain-hammering-ly lonnngg! This is especially excruciating, when scenes are drawn out, as in the walks through the woods, when we are forced to feel! every!! step!!! And, don't even get me started on the argument scene, where the two carry on yammering interminably, after lashing a zombie to a wagon wheel! Or, how about the -almost- demonoid love scene? Simultaneously gross and idiotic- this is where the silly title comes into play. There is a chase-through-the-catacombs sequence that is less of an embarrassment, but it's too little too late. Of course, the piece-de-resistance of the whole wretched affair is the attack-by-zombie-with-a-fishing-pole scene!

1006598,4,6305281483,"Let me begin by saying that the DVD itself is terribly bare bones. I purchased the one with the yellow outline, boasting an uncut ""limited edition"" featuring ""tromatic extras"". Unless a solitary trailer for the film itself counts, extras are non-existent. What makes it limited other than the color around the cover art? I don't understand. Also, the transfer is pretty dark. I had to squint and turn up the brightness settings on my tv to make out some of what was going on. It was annoying. Oh, and the disc art - or lack thereof - is hideous. It looks like caution tape...

That being said, this movie is pretty sweet. As i stated in the title, this is an Italian interpretation of/capitalization on Evil Dead. It's done in a truly Italian style with long, brooding shots and a story heavily concerned with sexual desire.

During the first half i felt underwhelmed, but the payoff is excellent. Splatter fans will get their kicks for sure, as there are several great blood spurting (and some gore) sequences with fitting sound effects to make your skin crawl. The practical FX and make-up were well done considering the glaring lack of budget, largely thanks to the camera work. The tiny cast - i believe there are only 5 people - also help to keep the film focused, and combined with the setting gives it almost a dream-like Dante Tomaselli quality.

The most impressive aspects of this film are A) the OUTSTANDING original score by Adriano Maria Vitali. It's haunting, and helps keep you engaged despite the dry story and drier script. I would honestly purchase this soundtrack if available on vinyl. B) The scenery, lighting, and shots taken are all absolutely beautiful and wondrously executed. I paused the movie at least 4 times during certain scenes and said to myself ""Damn, that would make such an awesome poster!"". I'm amazed the stills they used to advertise/promote the film weren't the ones i was drooling over.

Overall, this is an impressively pretty little picture, especially for what many people probably dismiss as a mere knock-off. They're not wrong, but there's also definitely a fresh artistic vision on display here. And again, the blood spitting/skin sucking/claw grabbing/meat hooking/body bloating makes for quite a ""moist"" flick. It's not of the wildly-entertaining-beer-and-popcorn-invite-your-friends-for-a-moviethon variety, but is a welcome addition for the relatively obscure horror aficionado/collector.",1342828800,2,2439,5.1206030150753765

Neither the title nor any brief synopses can reveal how random this film is.

IMDB says: The story of a hideous monster who takes the form of a beautiful, seductive woman who in a torrent of special effects, beauty and monster transform into a climax of pure evil. For years this monster woman has cursed a small village, and to this day her deadly grasps holds the peaceful residents in fear. This ferocious, feminine fury possesses a shocking sensual appetite and she can only satisfy her lust when passion consumes her, by striking where a man is most vulnerable.... and the results are deadly!  Right about NOW is when we should stop trusting IMDB and especially stop trusting misleading movie posters.

Written and directed by Andreas Marforinot known at all for is not at all classic Ataga sovetskikh zombiethis super low budget 80s Italian horror movie will draw giggles only from those in search of the bad and campy.

Seduced by a strange and sultry woman, a young man is brutally gored by her hairy clawed crotch tentacle.  Yes, you read that right.  A hairy tentacle with a claw at the end, emerging from this succubus nether region, killed a man.  The effects are nothing to brag about, but they're easily good enough to entertain fans of cheap horror and, hey, it tries.

Our sex-hungry murderess (who might be able to fly, not sure because the film is so poorly made) is picked up by a tourist couple (including Coralina Cataldi-Tassoni; Mother of Tears, Opera, Demons 2) who are subsequently warned about her by the weirdest possible man they could find in this tiny village among the Italian countryside.  The creepy localwho might just be the only local they find other than the crotch tentacle ladyunloads an elaborate regional history about summoning monsters.  Clearly our couple has found one.

This senselessly stupid film includes beer turning to sand, random zombie things, strange cauldrons of infectious goo, and the weirdest cuckoo clock ever.  Apparently, the demoness is trying to afflict the couple with something.  But its hard to understand whats even supposed to be going on as our couple hikes into the Alps with this weird stranger.

Other than the crotch claw, the effects and events of the 50 minutes are all rather dull. In the last 30 minutes things pick up and we are bombarded by diverse weirdness.  There is more crotch tentacle, weird monstrous (maybe tree root) tentacles, clothes-on zombie love, an unseen POV Evil Dead force rushing through the forest, crusty zombie attacks, bloody dismemberment and some weak demonic transformation.  Yes, this may sound goodbut its bad. Very, very bad. And youll probably only enjoy this if a bad horror movie is exactly what you were hoping to find.

The title seems quite misleading.  Our demoness implies sexuality and seduction, but never seems to consummate anything. So, Id struggle to understand how an evil clutch would ever come to benor was any infernal offspring of hers even implied.

In summary, this movie is horrible.  Its horrible, but its enjoyably horrible if you are in the mood for horrible and horrible draws laughter from you.  Whole lot of horrible, but Ive admittedly watched, reviewed and even enjoyed far, far worse.",1489017600,5,3242,4.910091743119266
