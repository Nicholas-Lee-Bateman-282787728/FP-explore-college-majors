8510655,5,B0075SCKV2,"These Private Snafu cartoons are from the golden age of Warner Brothers cartoons. The animation style is instantly recognizable, as is the voice characterizations of the one and only Mel Blanc. If you're a fan of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and the rest, you must see Snafu. These cartoons were commissioned by the Army during WW2 but they are filled with humor as well as lessons for soldiers. Please excuse the lack of political correctness, after all there is a war going on. There are also a couple of cartoons featuring a charracter called Mr Hook who is a sailor.",1330300800,13,565,4.66
