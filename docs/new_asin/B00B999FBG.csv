5564253,1,B00B999FBG,"This trailer is great  because you find out who's going to die, who comes back to life, and how the movie ends.  Thanks for saving me $3.99.",1367020800,3,140,4.148148148148148
5564254,3,B00B999FBG,"Just ok.  Watchable.  For 2.99 rental, sure why not.  I would not buy this movie for my collection, well if it were 2.99 maybe.",1366848000,,127,4.208333333333333
5564255,3,B00B999FBG,"The acting on the most part is good. The movie itself, somewhat predictable - as 1 reviewer stated: Same sandwich just different bread. LOL, I like that as it says it all. It is entertaining just don't expect a lot of gore or surprise. It's worth a watch.",1366761600,,255,4.333333333333333
5564256,5,B00B999FBG,"it was worth paying for this movie, kept me entertained.  it was scary and tense zombie movie.  i recommend it.",1366156800,,111,4.5
5564257,1,B00B999FBG,"No, no, no . . . I watch lots of horror movies (and lots of them zombie-themed) and this is just bad.  Bad acting, bad zombies, bad ending . . . just plain bad.",1365811200,,160,3.7058823529411766
5564258,3,B00B999FBG,"It was a decent rent, think more along a syfy type production but without the really bad CGI effects. The story line was of the ""teens in peril"" type but the action was pretty decent and moved the story along at a brisk pace.",1365811200,4,225,4.136363636363637
5564259,3,B00B999FBG,As far as Zombie movies go 13's scenario has been played out again and again and again. Same sandwich just different bread.  The only reason I gave this movie 3 stars was due to it's believable makeup and special effects.  They were very well thought out and real looking.  The one thing you rarely find in B movies usually due to lower budgets.  Rent on a night when you can't decide what you want to see and are getting sick of scrolling.,1365465600,15,440,4.329268292682927
5564260,4,B00B999FBG,"Great little flick true to the horror genre.  If you love a good zombie flick try this one on for size.  nice mix of humor, tension, blood and gore.  Sit back and relax for a good time.",1365292800,4,185,3.945945945945946
5564261,5,B00B999FBG,"Loved every second of this horror, very good story that's original and mixes lots of the best things from various horrors and puts them in one, very retro in a way and oldschool on the effects and gore and its well paced throughout, the cast was pretty good too especially the lovely Katharine Isabelle who is an amazing star and always at her best covered in blood!! Like I said the effects are brilliant all practical very bloody gory scenes and the make-up is awesome, like a cross between zombies and the creatures from the descent. This is a horror gem and well worth a watch, the DVD art on the cover is a little cheap but don't be put off by that its great, there are behind the scenes features too and a commentary and the disc must have no region code as I played it in a U.K bluray player no problems!!",1364256000,3,812,4.279220779220779

5564274,5,B00B999FBG,"THIS MOVIE WAS ALSO SEEN ONLINE TO AND IT WAS OKAY THANK YOU,",1417737600,,61,3.769230769230769
5564275,3,B00B999FBG,"This is a low budget horror, and they spent most of their money on the cast. That doesn't always work out as well as the pundits claim. That said, this is a fantastic cast. Katharine Isabelle, Brendan Fehr and Michael Shanks are the headliners and they're all in fine form, not phoning it in. The supporting cast does a great job too. The script is actually eerie. Forensics students do their practical on an island that was once a penitentiary with a spooky reputation. This practical involves using real cadavers in staged situations. The guy they bring along as a cook/handyman knows the stories about what used to go on when the island was a prison, and he gets more and more spooked while Shanks's professor character gets more and more impatient with him, which is a very effective way of ratcheting up the tension. The vibe is kind of like Mindhunters meets Re-Animator, at least until the zombies start rising. I don't think I'm spoiling it too much by revealing that part, as you can see from the cover that here there be zombies. The cover is also an accurate representation of how well these zombies are made up: not very well. There's one scene where a zombie chomps off a victim's fingers and then... spits them back out. It would have been less obvious how bad the effects were if they were shot at night, but a lot of them were shot in broad daylight. It's stuff like this that mars an otherwise decent low budget zombie flick. Watch this one for the performances, especially if you're a fan of any of these actors, but it's not very scary after the monsters show up.",1403395200,,1582,4.534965034965035
5564276,4,B00B999FBG,"If you are a big horror fan and can't help but love a little cheese in your life, you will enjoy this. I think its adorable and I absolutely love anything Kathrine Isabelle is in which mostly consist of cheesy gore. If you looking for a true horror, edge of your seat, pee a little movie, this one is not for you.",1401840000,,313,4.064516129032258
5564277,1,B00B999FBG,"Just another bad zombie movie, if you want to watch this rent it do not buy, one of the worst I have ever seen, was not even scary",1400630400,,130,3.6785714285714284
5564278,4,B00B999FBG,"Not perfect, nor necessarily original, but makes excellent use of the creepy intensity of its location and the premise that is reminiscent of Shock Waves, as well as the cast making good work out of slim written characters.  Katharine Isabelle, the two Brandons and Michael Shanks do well.  The ghouls are more dangerous and complex than your average zombie.  Enjoyable for what it is, a zombie tale of the old style school.",1392768000,,424,4.861111111111111
5564279,3,B00B999FBG,I don't think I'd add this to my collection but it is worth a watch. It's definetly a bit Eerie,1381449600,,95,3.8
5564280,2,B00B999FBG,"If you are old enough to have seen several Friday the 13th movies, you'll see most of the twists and turns of this film coming from a mile away. I thought the director made good use of his location, with some nice creepy shots in the woods. But the characters are really unappealing and some of them do pretty stupid things. You catch yourself thinking they all deserve to die.",1378166400,,377,4.4
5564281,3,B00B999FBG,For a Canadian movie it was pretty decent.  Thought it did drag on a little thought.  Maybe I'd see it again if it was free.,1375920000,,124,3.92
5564292,4,B00B999FBG,"This movie reminds me of a cross between cabin fever, evil dead, and CSI or something. If you're into blood and guts then it's got you covered. If you like evil ghoulish creatures, you're in luck. And if you like CSI then it's not really that interesting, but you get the point. The plot is sort of lost a little but the practical effects make up for it. It's pretty gross at times too so that's a plus. The gore is similar to the new remake of The Evil Dead so it's pretty good. I like how realistic the zombies/ghouls were, well except for one specific one that looked a little too much like he worked out all the time. Other than a dry plot and Arnold Swaurtzeghoulishzombie, I liked it. Definitely a rent at least.",1375574400,2,718,4.286764705882353
5564293,3,B00B999FBG,"I only heard of this movie because several members of the cast are people that I like. Katharine Isabelle (Ginger Snaps), Michael Shanks (Stargate) Brendan Fehr (Roswell). Being a huge zombie fan didn't hurt either. Low budget zombie flick with really good creature effects. A group of people stranded in a very out of the way place and the dead get up and chase them around. It's actually better than that. Good fun on a budget.",1375315200,2,429,4.657894736842105
5564294,1,B00B999FBG,No real plot weird acting zombies.  Not at all scary.  Definitely not a horror flick.  I will not rent it again,1373155200,,111,4.190476190476191
5564295,4,B00B999FBG,VERY GOOD MOVIE I RECOMMEND ANY ONE WHO L;OVES HORROR MOVIES THIS IS ONE YOU WOULD LIKE.. IT'S LIKE THE WALKING DEAD MEETS HOUSE OF THE DEAD. OTHER WORDS IT'S A ZOMBIE MOVIE,1371686400,,173,4.2727272727272725
5564296,1,B00B999FBG,"I had a hard time finding this movie, and found it at a good price. Boy, I wish I hadn't. One of the worst movies I've ever seen.",1370908800,,129,3.642857142857143
5564297,5,B00B999FBG,This movie scared the hell out of me and It was so good. Loved it. I love one of the people in it and that is why I bought It.,1369180800,,126,3.2333333333333334
5564298,3,B00B999FBG,"I may have missed it, but the movie doesn't explain itself very well. It is based on the Zombie mythos and the effects it would have on a body farm. For those of you who don't know what a body farm is (and this is where the movie doesn't tell you much), it is a place where corpses are placed in different situations and monitored for decomposition rates in heat, cold, insects, and other situations. The data is used in forensic pathology when the CSI people discover a corpse and try to establish when the person was killed as well as various other information. These gruesome places actually exist and there is a book called the Body Farm, which was established in 1980 by Dr. William Bass, that you can read if you want to know more (its a well written and horrific book).
The idea of these poor victims reanimating and causing havoc is a good one and much could be made use of in a original zombie movie, especially if they could somehow retain memories of their murder. This movie, however, is not it. This movie hovers in the mediocre ""watch for fun but don't count on anything new"" category.",1368748800,5,1099,4.445544554455446
5564299,1,B00B999FBG,"When the maggots are the best actors in the movie, I give 1 star. The zombies had the best lines. Could have been interesting if only the director cared.",1368576000,2,153,4.310344827586207
5564300,5,B00B999FBG,"I am a bit of a zombiephile and will readily select movies with such a theme. But lately, the pickings have been sparse. 13 Eerie was a very ""fresh take"" on what has quickly become a stale theme. My 17 year old son and I remarked with the same observation upon watching this movie, ""THAT was a good one.""",1367452800,,304,4.169491525423729
5564301,1,B00B999FBG,"Garbage, there isn't much else to say. Just another film full of educated idiots ignoring logic and practically working to get themselves killed.",1367107200,7,145,5.3478260869565215
8564497,5,B00B999FBG,This is a well acted and scripted movie. Those looking for zombie hordes will be disappointed. This is one or two zombies attacking at any given time making the conflict up close and personal. You see the emotions in the characters as they react to mysterious and then threatening situations. The atmosphere added to the tension as the characters fought for their lives.,1518825600,,370,4.888888888888889
8564498,4,B00B999FBG,This movie is so good zombies are so creepy in movie so He'll Yea my favorite movie lol,1507507200,,87,3.888888888888889
8564499,5,B00B999FBG,"Giving this 5 stars for gore factor alone! Nice concept and good acting even though the script/lines failed to utilize the good actors and actresses they had. There were also moments you rolled your eyes the predictability the action took. I almost gave 3 or 4 stars because of the storyline just needing a little more unpredictability.
BUT!...The moments of pure gore though were really great, in that 'laugh as you go HOLY S**T because it is so awesomely gross' way. Mostly standard zombie type kills and gore but a couple of nice surprises.
Production value good too, which is always nice. Special effects for the gore was on point and actually looked real unlike so many other lower budget movies.
Overall, if you just want to have a good time and not try and overthink it or expect some scientific glory....and you really love gore....then this is a great flick and totally worth it! It was great to have a solid cast like this play out a nice juicy zombie tale. I have watched about every zombie movie available on Amazon, and as far as the non theatrical release productions, this was definitely one of the best.
Sit back and relax and don't over think it or NEED some grand explanation and you'll enjoy the bloody show!",1480723200,,1227,4.63302752293578
8564500,3,B00B999FBG,"semi fun to watch but it missed it's potential.  great idea that never takes root.  the young scientists were more like 16 year olds who were initially scared, vomiting, making dumb jokes, clumsy and not all that bright.  They barely have any scenes together so there is no character development and no chance to act.  They could have been any group of campers running through the woods.  If they were not going to use science at all or the forensic concept, they should have just dumped it and made it a typical camping trip.  because the whole time you are just frustrated hoping they would use it.  it gets boring just watching them scream and shove s*** in Zombie heads.  when there was 9 minutes left I was ready to end it it got so monotonous.  but I held out until the abrupt cheap ending.",1467590400,,796,4.43448275862069
8564501,3,B00B999FBG,"It was alright. Another low budget B horror flick with no real surprises. Not the best zombie type movie I have seen and I consider myself a huge zombie fan. I'd rather watch Warm Bodies than this one, but if you're bored this might do the trick. I love Katharine Isabelle so I had to give this one a shot. She's a Scream Queen in my eyes. If you like her too, try American Mary, much better showcase for her talent.",1462665600,,416,4.148148148148148
8564502,3,B00B999FBG,"A decent zombie flick, but it didn't live up to its potential.  13 Eerie boasts some truly great actors who aren't nearly as famous as they deserve to be and an intriguing story idea (even if they pretty obviously ripped off Mindhunters).  Unfortunately, the actors are under-utilized (probably because the characters spend the bulk of the movie separated and so you only spend a couple of minutes with each character at a time) and the writers/director (whoever) missed out on a great opportunity to make the movie stand out from the standard zombie fare.  This is a zombie movie about forensic scientists... at least give us a LITTLE bit of bulls*** science on why there are zombies!  Use science to fight the zombies!  There is one scene where a character uses some chemicals to fight zombies, but that's it.  Otherwise it might as well have been a group of college-age kids and a couple of adults setting up a summer camp or something--not a group of highly educated soon-to-be forensics specialists (and a professor who's supposed to be 'the best' at forensics).  So, while this movie is decent, I can't help but feel disappointed by all the missed opportunities.",1453939200,2,1168,4.839195979899498
