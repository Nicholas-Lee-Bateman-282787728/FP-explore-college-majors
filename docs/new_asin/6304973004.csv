958560,5,6304973004,"This inspiring series I have seen literally dozens of times over the past 15 years. I am now a vet but began watching these shows when I was in high school. The actors do an outstanding job of bringing James Herriot's (Alf  Wight) stories to life and it is hard not to get wrapped up in them. You'll  find yourself watching episode after episode because they play like a book  that you just can't put down! Great mix of how the characters in Herriot's  life grow and change with his professional triumphs and tribulations. The  earliest episodes - in this set - have the best cast of actors and are the  most endearing. The British accents/speed of speech will take some getting  used to, but it's only a minor hurdle. I reach for these when I need a lift  or a good laugh, especially on a rainy day. Enjoy!",918000000,20,807,4.369127516778524

We love this show and for anyone who loves the country life back when it was a simple way of life don't miss this. You will love the old cars, machinery, no technology.
James Herriot will make you laugh till you cry at some of the antics the country vet gets up to, sometimes not so pleasant.
The way of life is spectacular.

958686,5,6304973004,"These DVD collections are terrific! It is such a luxury that we can watch some of these fine old shows and continue to enjoy them. This series is a wonderfully directed series about Yorkshire vet and his experiences from the 1930's thru the 1950's. I have personally travelled there to view the area where it was filmed. Literally people live there who were written about in the series. As of 2007, one or two of the ""Farnons"" were still alive and living nearby ""Darrowby"", which is actually Thirsk. The landscape looked exactly the same as it did in the series, and the series depicts an even older timeframe.

If you want real characters, thoughtful directing, and good story telling all in a beautiful, timeless setting, then All Creatures Great and Small is for you.

I cant remember if these have subtitles.. many UK dvd releases skip Captions for the Hearing Impaired. For Americans unaccustomed to thick accents, this can really hinder the enjoyment and understanding of the stories told by these wonderful programs.",1442448000,4,1023,4.907514450867052

This DVD series does not lesson the joy of the book series.. There's an energy to this recount of James Harriot's life as we watch his challenging life as a vet in the gorgeous  Yorkshire Dales of England. Harriot's sense of humor makes one laugh out loud.as we watch him trying to escape from horses, pigs and cows. But most of the animals are good and aware that he is trying to help them.

There's romance here too, but even those circumstances are laced with humor. Harriot's love of life is contagious and refreshing.",1423180800,2,641,4.378151260504202

The film quality suffers a bit as compared to current standards, but that will not affect your ability to enjoy the wonderful stories in the life of a Veterinary practice in 1930's England. The central character, James Herriot, is a Scott and a recent graduate of Vet School trying to find a job when he is invited to interview at a Vet Clinic in Darrowby run by Siegfried Farnon. A highly experienced Vet well-known by the locals, Dr. Farnon can be a bit difficult to read at times, but James learns how to deal with him and his younger brother, Tristan.

After watching it with her, I can completely see why she was hunting so hard for it! I refuse to tell her where I found it, since I now don't have to wonder what to get her for her birthday.

Just to be clear, we were using Amazon Prime's instant video service to view it, so I can't review the DVDs or anything like that. But it is frustrating that other video services have this series and Amazon no longer has the license for it.

As for the show itself, it's a pleasure to watch and the quality was good. It is, after all, a television series from the 70's. I gave it three stars because of Amazon's service, not because of the show itself. (Oddly, Amazon asked me to review this show after it was pulled so I am taking the time to voice my displeasure.)

I hope Amazon resolves the license situation for this wonderful series soon!",1381363200,,857,4.480769230769231
959020,2,6304973004,"I heard so many fantastic reviews of how great this series was that I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, I found the series to be a cure for insomnia. Not only was it remarkably boring overall, I found the romance between the James Herriot character and Helen to be uninspired and predictable. Except for a few jokes from the Siegfried character that made me smile, I lost interest by the midpoint of the first series. That's my review. A very brief one and strict to the point.

The next unpleasant surprise I got was that Amazon.com put a restriction on the item so that I am not able to resell it. After I contacted customer service, I got a very vague answer that there are some ""good"" customers who can create a listing and sell this DVD, but I guess with my 5 stars as a seller, I was not one of them and was not good enough. I was told that they have their own criteria by which they choose if a seller is good or not that they do not share with the public. So, I ended up with a very boring DVD in mint condition that I can't resell to someone who would appreciate it. Double disappointment.

To avoid such unpleasant surprises in the future, I won't ever buy any DVD's on Amazon.  As for the series, as I mentioned before, I find it very boring. I give it a 2 and not a 1 only because of the scenes of the British countryside, which looks so picturesque.",1379980800,2,1369,4.197718631178708

959080,5,6304973004,"Started reading these books in high school and fell in love. I have a love of animals, especially dogs. Finding these books as a young person pulled me into a wonderful world and culture I'd never experienced before, but somehow I felt I knew them. I followed the BBC series on PBS when ever I caught it on tv. I was delighted to see the series on Amazon Prime several weeks ago! It was wonderful and caught up on season one and then season two. The actors portrayal of the characters follow the books very closely and I love the chemistry of the ensemble. The books made me laugh and cry and always uplifted me. The programs have done the same.  So here is the sad part for me. Amazon shows seasons 3 through 7 in Prime however, they are not available for viewing. Ispeaking to customer care I was told that the BBC has the rights to the series and have pulled the remaining seasons 3-7. and probably had other plans for the seasons (whatever that means, the rep really had no other answer than that). You can BUY the series on DVD for around $250.00 however.
I hope one day the remaining seasons will be available on Prime.",1378944000,,1125,4.357142857142857

Then we moved to where we did not get cable and I missed the last 4 years. When I found the series was available on Amazon in DVD I got all 7 seasons, and began to watch them in 2011. Then we moved, and lo and behold, I found them on Amazon Prime this spring (2013), and have watched most of season one again. The Amazon Prime experience is much better than the DVD in terms of picture quality. In terms of story, setting, and characters, it doesn't get better than this. Wonderful animals bring out the best, and sometimes the worst, in their people. The Yorkshire Dales accent becomes easier to understand as you move through the episodes, and it helps to have read (and reread) the books. This series hasn't aged a bit, and is fully equal to Downton Abbey, which I also adore. Likewise, Upstairs Downstairs.  All available for free on Amazon Prime.

959375,5,6304973004,"Just discovered this series from Netflix streaming. Very well done that stays mostly true to the books. I know because I've read them all a few times. Wonderful cast for the most part except for the change of Helen in the final four seasons. Carol Drinkwater played Helen in the beginning. She was very good, lent a touch of class and elegance to the role, but then Lynda Bellingham played Helen for the final four seasons and she is terrible, brings basically no personality into it and has nill screen presence but the rest help make up for it. All thru the final four seasons I was missing Carol Drinkwater's Helen. The casting decisions are right on in so many respects, except for this. I was going to give one less star because of it but I enjoyed the show and the other performances so much that I didn't think it would be fair.",1365638400,,835,4.428571428571429

To me it was like bringing animated, living color to the imaginations my mind had previously envisioned when I read the books. The series is so thoroughly enjoyable and refreshing, episodes that whisk you away to a time and place when life was more simple and the basic essentials for life, family, friends, sustenance and character, were all that mattered and made life worth living. The stories revolve around the real life experiences of an English country vet as he first enters into practice. The tales of getting to know and understand the ways of the country folk in an area new to him along with his encounters with the animals he treats, so warmly emphasize, sometimes with humor or unexpected surprise, the value of life and how it is relished and enjoyed no matter what one has in life.",1363305600,,1001,4.791907514450867

The first couple of episodes of Season 1 serve to set up the back story for the rest of the series.  Once you've seen them you can move on to the fun of the rest of Season 1 and the other Seasons.  The video is a little grainy if you're used to HD - but they were made in the late 70's.  An absolutely charming story.  Fun to watch with children.  Uplifting.

The actors are good and portray characters who make me laugh, such as the depiction of the ongoing struggles of Tristan to hide his partying and problems with studying from big brother Sigfried, while at the same time pulling a number of practical jokes on James Herriot.

The story line is clever, the acting is quite good, and it follows the original story well.  It is one of our favorite book series which we periodically reread which has been adapted very well into a video series. James is a naive character who values the simplicity of country life.  Siegfried is the authoritarian boss with a heavy dose of compassion.  Tristan is an irresponsible but brilliant vagabond who wants to live life to the fullest.

959644,5,6304973004,"Even though this series was filmed in 1978 I seemed to miss it.  I enjoyed watching it and I think I could see this again and again.  The stories of James Herriot's life as a vet in rural Yorkshire were just heartwarming and funny as he deals with the local farmers and their ways and traditions much less trying to understand their dialect.  The Farnon brothers, Siegfried and Tristan are the ultimate in eccentricity.  Siegfried, the older brother and principal partner is a man of contradictions who drives everyone over the top yet he remains kind and caring of not only the animals and their owners but his partner as well.  Tristan the slacker, vet student, partier, and younger brother gets a lot of laughs with his constant schemes and pranks and often suffers the wrath of Sigfried in his mission to reform Tristan.  There is romance thrown in as well as we are introduced to Helen Alderson who with a lot of dating mishaps finally becomes the wife of James Herriot.  The individual stories of animals and their owners is sometimes heartbreaking but there are a lot of miracles thrown in.  The special feature on the DVD is of Alf Wight, the vet who wrote the stories under the pen name of James Herriot, as he talks of his life as a vet.  He was in his 60s during the time that the film was made and still in active practice of veterinary medicine.",1339977600,,1358,4.510204081632653

I work with animals, and I had heard that this show is funny for people in the veterinary field, the way that every animal treatment becomes a soap opera.  So I was expecting to laugh at it, but I ended up getting almost totally charmed by it.  It is really more like a subtle sitcom about life in rural England before WWII.  All the humor and observations about rural British folk is what you should watch this for.  The animal stories are either amazingly happy or amazing tragic, which makes you wonder about their truthfulness.  But the way the farmers act has got to be taken from real life.

959687,5,6304973004,"This is one of the best British TV show that I have seen. I have watched quite a few other British shows: Open All Hours, Yes Minister, Yes Prime Minister, Good Neighbors, Allo Allo, Only Fools and Horses and Fawlty Towers to name a few. I would rate this show to be up there in the top-tier.

The show has a feel-good factor to it and I'm sure animal lovers will like it more. The acting is very realistic and Christopher Timothy (as James Herriot, the assistant Vet) is outstanding. The characters are very memorable and you will enjoy Siegfried and Tristan more than the other characters. You will fall in love with Helga's (Carol Drinkwater) smile. Even though the video is not of HD quality, the sceneries of 'Darrowby' are beautiful to watch. Very beautiful for a show taken in 1978.

One might get a feeling that the show is too slow. But that should go away after the first two episodes. The first two episodes are all about introducing the characters and setting up the 'stage' for the remainder of the series. My wife and I could not stop watching and we watched all the episodes of the First Series in one weekend. Unlike other British shows, for non English speakers, you can watch this without closed-captions.

959688,5,6304973004,"Stories about a country vet in ""remote"" northern England may not sound too enticing, but these episodes are based on true-life events in the life of country vet James Herriot (not his real name), but the books these TV episodes are based on were written in first-person, and the translation to the TV screen is exceptional.  The stories tale the story of a young Scottish vet in his first position as a country vet dealing with problems with horses, cows, sheep, dogs, cats, birds, turtles, and especially with their sometimes very strange and unusual owners, as well as the other everyday folk that still want to hold on to older remedies, and not afraid to inform young James of these older remedies (such as marshmellow ointment - a very secret remedy from an old gentlemsn James meets in the local pub).
You will find humor and drama in these heart-warming stories.  Personally, I was ""introduced"" to James Herriot through these TV stories, but I made my way to the books they were based on, and found many enjoyable hours reading the stories.
They are really the kind of stories you will not want to leave.  They WILL become favorites very quickly.  Any reputable book store will carry his books, or at least be able to order them for you. (I haven't looked yet, but maybe you can find them here on Amazon.com also.)
One more thing:  Each episode is about 50 minutes long, and you will be so absorbed in the story you are watching, you will not miss the time.
Get ready to laugh, shed a tear, cheer on James and his fellow veterinarian workers.  Oh, yes, do you like love stories?  That is here also.",1269388800,4,1605,4.571428571428571

The actors are great and, if you are like me, you'll start laughing before the punchline comes.  Don't watch it if you only like lots of action.  There are plenty of peaceful country scenes.

Possibly, people just don't like to have their conceptions of a book or series shaken by someone else's interpretation of it. Not to be scoffed at as well is Hollywood's ineptitude (see the Hollywood production of Pride and Prejudice, 2005.) Regardless of what causes it, it seems to run rampant in most film adaptations of books. All Creatures Great and Small, however, breaks all the rules. The BBC takes Herriot's masterpiece and perfects it, to create what I believe to be the best television series in the world. The only, and I mean ONLY, problem I have ever had with All Creatures Great and Small is the fact that the slightly quirky cases the dvd's come in break easily. A pull-out/fold-out setup would definitely have been better. Anyway, I highly reccommend the TV show and the books because they are the exceptions to the rule.",1174348800,6,950,4.798780487804878

Very rarely will television or film come close to equaling the original source, but here they did.  Filming on location, with talented character actors and beautiful artistic production, you will believe you are looking back in time to the 1930s.

The series stars Christopher Timothy as James Herriot.  Two actors played the character, in films, before this series - neither came close to becoming Herriot, like Timothy did.

Supporting Timothy is the excellent Robert Hardy as Siegfried.  Robert Hardy is so perfect in this role that you will be disappointed if you ever see the film version where the role was played by none other than Sir Anthony Hopkins.

The series acquires an excellent authenticity in the real animal scenes, such as birthing lambs.

If you're ever in England, be sure to visit Thirsk and Askrigg (the former is the real town that Darrowby is based on and the latter is the quaint village they filmed the series in).",1168473600,8,1181,5.077720207253886

You do feel the sense of family and community that is so much a part of country life

I am glad it is now on DVD. I can replay some of the sections with heavy brogue, so I can understand what they are saying!  The country English is sometimes difficult to interpret.  Closed captioning would be a perfect addition.

We meet all the ""main"" characters of the series: James Herriot (Christopher Timothy), Siegfried Farnon (Robert Hardy), Tristan Farnon (Peter Davison), and Helen Herriot, nee Alderson (Carol Drinkwater).  We're also introduced to many of the great characters which appear throughout all five series, such as Margaretta Scott, who plays the dear and daffy Mrs. Pumphrey, and her dour gardener, Hogekin, played by Teddy Turner, as well as the wonderful Mary Hignett, who plays Mrs. Hall, the Skeldale House housekeeper.  This is a series full of subtle humor, irony, and sly wit that is refreshing after the over-the-top hilarity found in so many American ""comedies.""

959839,5,6304973004,"These DVDs contain the entire first season of the BBC's production of the series `All Creatures Great and Small'.  Each episode represents, more or less, one chapter from James Herriott's epinonymous novels.  This is one of the very few cases in which the film/TV version is as good as the book.  These DVDs are absolutely outstanding.  The story centers on a vet freshly out of veterinary school in the 1930s who is learning about his profession and about life in Yorkshire. He is surrounded by a motley (eclectic? eccentric?) cast of characters.  This series was filmed in the 70s and 80s, so that the production quality is rather low by modern standards.  I do not view this as a drawback, though.  It really gives the series a more realistic, almost gritty, less glitzy look.  The acting is superb, particularly by Christopher Timothy and Robert Hardy.  Good acting is almost non-existent on television today.  The animals are, of course, the stars of this series as well.

These stories are about life and all its little (and not so little) ups and downs.  Each episode contains several story threads, some of which weave their way through the entire series, some only lasting one or a few episodes.  We watch James, the main character, develop his trade, learn to understand the Yorkshire locals, make lasting friendships, and fall in love.  In short, we follow James living his life with all his successes and defeats, big and small.  The full range of human emotions are on display in this series, the stories are hilarious, frustrating, sad, and hopeful in turn.  The message promoted throughout this series is to enjoy the simple life and accept what life throws at you for better or worse.

If I had any negative comment at all, it would be that the series slowly declines after the first few years (a not uncommon problem).  This is a minor quibble, and the entire series is well worth the money spent.  I watch these DVDs over and over, and when I have a bad day, I dream of going down to the Drover's Arms to have a pint with James and Tristan.

This was back in the early 1980's while James Herriot was still relatively unknown in the USA. Imagine my delight when I turned on the television one Friday evening after reading several chapters of ""All Creatures Great and Small"" to discover the BBC had produced a series based on the books! The writing, directing, and acting are brillant in seasons 1 through 3 of this series.

I've purchased season one on videotape, and I'm planning on replacing that with DVDs.  It's that good.

The episodes are all worth seeing with the whole family.  Set in the days before modern veterinary medicine, the vets need to make due with medicines that have been used for years; yet they also need to keep up with newer medicines and techniques that the local farmers are highly suspicious of.  They also have to put up with the grumbling of those same farmers who complain about the prices the vets charge.

The series tells the story of newly qualified Scottish vet Herriot (Christopher Timothy) travelling to Yorkshire,  to secure a job of assistant vet to Seigfried Farnhan (Robert Hardy) This first series tells how James gets the job, his first tentative steps in the practice, his courtship,  and subsequent marriage to  local girl Helen Alderton (Carol Drinkwater) and his first  meeting with the youthful and philandering Brother of Siegfried, Tristan (Peter Davison)

Also in this series, Sigfrieds exasperation over his Brothers failiure to qualify, his hilarious attempts to organise the practise by employing a dragon like secretary, Winnifrid Harbottle!

The story of the vets unfolds against the impending world war two, often bringing into play nostalgic elements, like listening to Lamplight the wireless in the sitting room, cosy fireside chats, and mealtime cnversations, making the audience often appreciate the joy of home cooking, and the companionship of good friends and family.

James dedication to his work is at times, in the opinion of his partners, bordering on the obsessive... Also shining through is his innate caring attitude towards the community he has grown to love. But it is the towering performence of Robert Hardy as Siegfried, and his psychological battles with his Brother Tristan, which went a long way to making this series the gem that is is.",1101081600,18,1462,5.24892703862661

From the start the young vet has his work cut out for him, not only with the animals and the quirks of the Yorkshire country folk, but also with his volatile boss Siegfried, brilliantly played by Robert Hardy, and Siegfried's fun-loving and ever-mischievous younger brother Tristan.

A mixture of drama and very witty comedy, the main characters are played to perfection by Christopher Timothy, Robert Hardy, and Peter Davison, supported by a fine cast of British character actors as the ""good country people"" of the dales.

The DVDs are pretty standard - the interior video footage is quite clean and nice, but the 16mm film exteriors is often grainy and dirty (this is improved somewhat on the series 2 set). The only supplement is on disc 4 - a one-hour 1980s interview with the real James Herriot, veterinarian Alf Wight. Still, the real joy is in the episodes themselves.

959913,4,6304973004,"Our Background: My wife, who was born in Russia, yet lived near Kiev Ukraine in a Soviet commune farm, loved reading the books ""All Creatures Great & Small"" from James Herriot (real name: Alf Wight). When we got married & she moved to the United States, we both fell in love with movie adaptations from Jane Austin's novels. This lead to a British TV series invasion in our house, starting with ""Darling Buds of May"" & later when we found the DVD book set of ""All Creatures Great & Small"". Let's give it a try...
The Production: The TV series ""All Creatures Great & Small"" started in Great Britain on January 1978 with no nonsense photography with the typical grain of that time period. Some photography scenes were taken direct off Yorkshire farms. There are very little special effects, the only ones I can think of is either drugged or fake animals to act out certain quick scenes. Were some of the animals trained to act like they were sick or dying? Sometimes certain operations were preformed with a human hand, checking the rear of certain animals for pregnancies or intestinal problems. At times when the actors themselves are seen performing inspections on the animals, their hands were either hidden behind the animals or the actors were making faces with the lower parts of their bodies off the screen. Very down to Earth & as real as possible with great effect.
The Actors: Christopher Timothy plays James Herriot, a Scottish newly qualified Veterinarian traveling down to Yorkshire England for a job interview with Veterinarian Surgeon Siegfried Farnon, played by Robert Hardy, in the town & farming community of Darrowby during the 1930's. Later Veterinary student & Siegfried's younger brother Tristan, played by Peter Davison (later to become the fifth Dr. Who), who travels back & forth during college. Also in the house is the housekeeper, Mrs. Hall, played by Mary Hignett. At last after dating James through the first of the series & then marring him is Helen, played by Carol Drinkwater. Our favorite minor character is Mrs. Pumphrey, played by Margarette Scott, a rich widower who has a Pekingese dog Tricki Woo. Mrs. Pumphrey constantly over feeds the dog almost to death, which James rescues with a diet, & he is awarded grommet treats of cigars & Port.
Commentary: The first program started out rather slow with references to British & Scottish language problems & it was not until the third or fourth program that we both started to understand & enjoy the series. In the end it was like experiencing new neighbors in our family room each night. This box set comes with 4 DVD's: at three to four 50 to 55 minute programs per DVD. The last DVD comes with an interview with the real James Herriot: Alf Wight.
If you like the first DVD box set series, there are now two other DVD Box sets, the second & third seasons, & a single DVD of 2 specials from the mid 1980's. ""All Creatures Great & Small"" did return to British TV in the late 1980's with 4 seasons, but these are only on VHS at this time. A good buy if your into real life comedy.",1073606400,13,3061,4.67037037037037

959955,5,6304973004,"Of all the superb British productions, none touch the heart quite like All Creatures Great and Small.  Certainly, this delightful comedy-drama is one of our entire family's all-time favourites--one which we've watched numerous times and continue to enjoy to this day.
Though the names of people and places were changed, the series is based on the true stories of Yorkshire veterinarian, James Herriot (the nom de plume of Alf Wight, who sadly died of prostate cancer in 1995 at age 78).  The series opens in the early 1930s with James (played by Christopher Timothy), a serious-minded and very conscientious newly qualified vet, arriving in the tiny Yorkshire farming town of Darrowby for a job interview at Skeldale House, the home/surgery of veterinarian Siegfried Farnon (Robert Hardy).  Siegfried, though a very competent vet and an extremely generous man, is one of the most contrary and mercurial individuals.  Heaven help the other members of the practice, who walk on eggshells most of the time as it is, should he get a bee in his bonnet about something!  The third member of the practice (if one can call him that, for he's still a veterinary student in the early episodes), is Siegfried's younger brother (and polar opposite in temperament), Tristan (Peter Davison).  Tristan is a gregarious, skirt-chasing practical joker and one of the laziest individuals around.  Certainly, he'd rather have a pint, play a prank, or chat up the girls than study for exams or be on call at the surgery.  The stage is set then for some very comical situations, which are rendered all the funnier and all the more welcome as relief from the very real drama of the stories.
Apart from the vets, the series is peppered with a wealth of memorable characters.  There's the Farnons' good-hearted but no-nonsense, mother-hen housekeeper, Mrs. Hall (sadly, the actress portraying her died after the third series); and who can forget the gruff, tight-fisted, cheap-skate farmer, Mr. Biggins--the bane of the practice; or wealthy (and demonstrably grateful!) Mrs. Pumphrey, whose pampered pekingese Tricki Woo suffers a host of complaints related to his rich diet and idle lifestyle.  Of course, one mustn't forget James' devoted wife Helen (Carol Drinkwater, who was replaced by Lynda Bellingham in the fourth series)--their courtship provided the basis for much humour in the early episodes--or the larger-than-life Granville Bennett (James Grout), whose veterinary skill is matched only by his hospitality and his ability to consume copious amounts of alchohol (not to mention food!), much to James' immense discomfort and embarassment.
With thirteen 50-minute episodes, this boxed set contains the complete first series.  Produced in 1978 and set against the backdrop of the magnificent Yorkshire dales, this is a thoroughly entertaining series which, like the wonderful books that inspired it, takes one through the gamut of emotions--from laughter to tears.  It is a series which transports the viewer back to a time and way of life that is, in many ways sadly, gone forever.  It is sure to be enjoyed by anyone looking for quality entertainment that the whole family can enjoy, but it will especially be treasured by fellow animal lovers.
There are, at the time of writing, four boxed sets (containing the complete first four series) plus a DVD with two special episodes (its video counterpart only contains the first special, unfortunately), and I highly recommend the entire series.  If you enjoy the first boxed set, by all means go ahead and purchase the remaining sets (and specials), as the entire series is outstanding.  There are still another two or three series that have yet to be brought to video/DVD, and I know I'm not alone in hoping the BBC will release them sometime soon.  Indeed, if ever a series deserved to be released in its entirety, it is this one.  Extremely highly recommended!",1068422400,46,3896,5.110236220472441
959956,5,6304973004,"Amazon also sells the books about Al Whight, the true name of the author of the books about James Herriott.
I have watched this series since I was a little girl, and much like Disney movies, I see different layers of meaning as I move through changes in my own life. The characters growth and love stories, losses and struggles can easily be related to, and are told in a fun, warm and real manner. If you are fond of animals, this series is a MUST. It may seem like a lot of money for this boxed set, but I have watched the episodes so many times, I would have paid much more in movie tickets had this been released in theaters.
Some things just don't get old.
Also, try reading the books the series are based on, I can't read them in bed any more, my sniggers keeps my husband from sleeping. Hillariously funny, especially the cat and dog stories.
The technical quality is very good considering this was shot and filmed so many years ago. The absence of fancy special effects just helps keep the whole series time appripriate.
The episodes can be watched individually and over time, no need to set aside the whole weekend to watch it all at once. But you might choose to once you get started.",1054252800,23,1194,4.358744394618834
959957,5,6304973004,"When it was on the American PBS series, My wife and I watched it religiously.  From the very beginning from getting the job as vet, to the end, driving off to go to war it shows the passion and reality of the peoples lives during that time.  In this series you will find tears and laughter, wonder and amazement.
The series is enhanced in that Robert Hardy is one of the greatest actors I have ever seen.  He was the backbone of the series.
I have no complaint on the quality of the copies, its really quite good.  I have no bad things to say about there being no interviews with the actors, the acting is simple perfection.
If you like to see real peoples lives, watch this series.  This isn't Empty Nest stuff, its real.",1053907200,6,722,4.279411764705882
959958,5,6304973004,"All Creatures Great and Small is the most wonderful series on Earth (heck, and the other planets too).  Although it doesn't really matter which episodes you begin with (the last ones were the first ones I saw) I think it's best to start at the beginning.  In the first episode of the series, ""Horse Sense,"" we see how newly-qualified vet James (Christopher Timothy) arrives in Darrowby and at the practice of Siegfried Farnon, MRCVS (Robert Hardy).  It's a great episode, which wonderfully establishes all the ACGAS characters and themes one eventually comes to know and love.
However, in my opinion, the episode where the story really begins is the second one, ""Dog Days,"" in which we meet Siegfried's mischievous, irresponsible, and wonderful younger brother, Tristan (Peter Davison) who has failed all his vet school tests, not for the first time.  It is wonderful to see the relationship between Siegfried and Tristan established.  The acting is first-rate from all the cast members - and if I may cite a shallower reason for enjoying this, Tristan is ADORABLE.  (I hope the capital letters suffice as description.)  There are also a bunch of animals in each episode, all of whom rival him for the cuteness title, depending on your point of view.
I guarantee you will enjoy this series.",1045526400,4,1290,4.944444444444445

A year ago I had purchased this DVD collection for our 3 year anniversaty. It was one of the best presents I ever gave him, he loves to watch the show so mucn, and it brings back many fond memories of his own father who was a country vet in Saskatchewan.
It's an excellent family show, full of amusing circumstances and I can't wait for the next set to be released on DVD.",1043280000,,522,4.077669902912621
959960,3,6304973004,"Although this is my all time favorite books, I was a little disappointed with the DVD. While we were watching the episodes, it seemed like the film was edited. The part mosted notable was when James was getting back at Tristan by calling the surgery and telling him the ""calf bed"" fell out again. Before the scene was over it cut to the surgery the next day where James and Tristan were stiching up a rabbit. There were other jumps in the film. I know that scenes were not jumped by the DVD player. Anyway it is still a great story. If anyone has had any different experiences I would like to hear about them.",1028592000,10,609,4.304347826086956

We love the characters, my favorite is Sigfred, he so sure of himself, even when he is so pompous.  The production brings the charm of the country setting into your livingroom.  We enjoyed the series when it was running on BBC and now treasure its memories while viewing it again.  I can't wait for the next series to be released on DVD.",1026345600,4,503,4.445652173913044
959962,5,6304973004,"This DVD presents in a simple straightforward package the first TV season (13 episodes of approx 55 mins each)of the classic ""All Creatures Great and Small"" series based on the books of the Veterinary Surgeon James Herriot.
An aditional one hour documentary interview with the real James Herriot is also included.
The original series was a weekly ""must see"" event and I found myself drawn back to watch just one more episode on this DVD despite serious attempts to make it last.
The picture quality is what you would expect for a 25 year old British TV show however this in no way detracts from its enjoyment. The happy flowing music that rolls with the beautiful Yorkshire Dales scenery puts you right in the mood to get to know and experience the trials and tribulations of James Herriot and the people and animals he meets.
Although the books were written by Herriot the main characters that stand out in this series are his new employer Siegfried Farnon and Siegfrieds brother Tristan. Both characters are played extremely well by two excellent british actors Robert Hardy and Peter Davison. Hardy extracts tha maximum entertainment from Siegfrieds ebullient often frustrating character.
In the end you will connect with the Dales farmers and wonder at the 'black magic' of veterinary science in the mid 1930's but like Gerald Durrels books the animals that entertain the most are of the human species.
This DVD will guarantee a good satisfying viewing experience and while not intended to be a comedy provides some hilarious situations for the main characters.",1026172800,239,1565,4.977099236641221
959963,5,6304973004,"I am so happy to have found this DVD set.  I was a huge fan of ACGS while stationed in England, and thought that I would not get another opportunity to enjoy the show now that I'm back in the US.  The DVD set gives me confidence that I will be able to enjoy the series for years to come, whereas my VHS tapes tend to wear out quickly.  I pray that they will release the remaining seasons on DVD.",1025654400,4,395,3.9125
959964,5,6304973004,"Oftentimes, the memory of something is better than the reality. But in the case of the new DVD of ACGS, I am delighted to say, the reality is easily equal to the memory!!! Back in the late seventies I would eagerly watch each episode of ACGS on American public TV. But when I moved to another state that didn't carry it, I thought I may never see it again. So, when I saw that it was offered on DVD, I immediately bought it. And what a payoff! I am once again laughing out loud at Siegfried's hypocracy, Tristan's devilishness and James's look of ""I can't believe these guys!"" And once again, I am totally enchanted with Helen's radiant smile and Mrs. Hall's hearty cooking. The animals, townspeople and late 1930's rural life are lovingly created down to the smallest detail. This show is what great entertainment is all about. American TV has nothing over great BBC fair. I have been watching TV for over 50 years and I enthusiastically proclaim this series as one of the very best acted, best written and most consistently en""joy""able shows ever made. I only hope the BBC doesn't wait 20 years to put out the ENTIRE series on DVD.",1024790400,9,1133,4.53170731707317
959965,5,6304973004,"I never thought much of this series because it usually came on at the same time as Star Trek and whenever I did see it I didn't know who anybody was.  However, I bought this dvd collections for my mother, who loves the series and the books, for mothersday and now that I've been able to see it from the beguinning I really must say it is excellent.  Great stories, great acting, great dialogue, great chemistry between characters, and most episodes leave me laughing for quite a while after watching them.  Tristan and Sigfreude (bad spelling, sorry :o) ...) are hillarious, Hellen is enchanting, and James makes for an excellent main character.  I have only 3 episodes left and there is also a documentary at the end on the real James Harriot which I have not watched.  That is it for extras though.  As a series I rate this easily at 5 stars.  As a DVD collection though I would give it only 3 1/2 because while the video is pretty clean there is only so much you can do with an old BBC production, and the fact that the only extra is a documentary on James Harriot.  Where are cast interviews, behind the scenes features, bloopers, ect. ????  The menus are also cumbersome to navigate threw, not a problem for me but for people who are not technical at all such as my mother, it really is a problem.  Problems aside, this is definatly worth the money and I certainly hope they put other seasons out on dvd soon.  :o)",1023580800,15,1419,4.398467432950191

959967,5,6304973004,"In the early 1980's, when I was in law school, my wife and I recorded many of the episodes in this collection on our old Betamax video recorder.  At night, after a long and trying day, we would watch them over and over with our then little girls curled up on the couch in their blanket sleepers. This is one of the handful of television series I have EVER watched as an adult.  There was an overwhelming comfort in entering into this warm household of eccentrics -- James, Siegfried and Tristan, with Mrs. Hall hovering in the kitchen.  Of course, the animal stories and the forays into the landscape and characters of the Yorkshire Dales are fascinating, but isn't it really the inexplicable hominess of Skeldale House that draws us back again and again?
For years my wife and I searched unsuccessfully for copies of these episodes.  Our Betamax machine is, alas, long gone and our little girls are in college.  But what a joy to see the series afresh after nearly twenty years.  The music has a certain dated cheeziness about it, but how marvelous to be back in the sitting room or in the surgery again with James, Siegfried and Company.
Some other thoughts:
1.  While I hope to get the later series, this is the best by far from a dramatic point of view, with James struggling to prove himself, Helen still unattainable and the complex relationship of Siegfried and Tristan freshly viewed.
2.  I do wish this set were available on DVD.
3.  The acting -- especially from Robert Hardy as Siegfried -- is so superb from this little ensemble. There is the stuff of greatness about the inherent tension, irony and exquisitely restrained comedy of the trio.",1014336000,178,1654,4.636986301369863

Christopher Timothy plays James, Robert Hardy plays Siegfried, and his brother Tristan is played by the well known actor Peter Davison, who later became the Fifth Doctor in Doctor Who.

The actors do an outstanding job of bringing James Herriot's (Alf Wight) stories to life and it is hard not to get wrapped up in them. You'll find yourself watching episode after episode because they play like a book that you just can't put down! Great mix of how the characters in Herriot's life grow and change with his professional triumphs and tribulations. The earliest episodes - in this set - have the best cast of actors and are the most endearing. The British accents/speed of speech will take some getting used to, but it's only a minor hurdle. I reach for these when I need a lift or a good laugh, especially on a rainy day. Enjoy!",986428800,17,799,4.369127516778524
