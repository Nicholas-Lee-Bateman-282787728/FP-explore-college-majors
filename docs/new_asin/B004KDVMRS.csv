8432735,5,B004KDVMRS,"This is obviously a magnificent movie, showing an unforgettable picture of life in Mongolia. I have to admit, though, that I was so bothered by the scene of the killing of the sheep that I stopped the movie and asked the seller if I could return the DVD. I want to commend the seller highly, who instantly agreed to take it back and refunded my money ""faster than a speeding bullet,"" only deducting a small fee because, of course, the DVD no longer had that magic plastic wrap to show that it was new.

In fact, the scene of the sheep-killing was not even bloody or unpleasant. The actual cutting with the knife was not shown, and the sheep gave no sign of suffering. I don't know whether the scene was faked, or the Mongolians have particularly humane ways of preparing animals to be eaten. I wonder if any viewer can tell me. I am not usually squeamish about blood (the fake but bloody throat-cutting in ""Prisoner of the Mountains"" did not bother me a bit), but this did, perhaps BECAUSE I was uncertain if an animal was actually being killed. Comments would be appreciated, as the rest of what I saw of this movie is too good for viewers to miss just because of one scene.",1454371200,,1175,4.414746543778802
8432736,3,B004KDVMRS,"I VERY MUCH agree with the last sentence of the first paragraph, and the subject line, of C. Nicholas Morrison's review. I ordered the South Korean DVD off eBay, because it was cheaper there, rather than off Amazon. Specs I saw suggested that the audio language was Russian only, and a picture of the reverse side of the South Korean DVD cover likewise only mentioned Russian. However, elsewhere on Amazon someone suggested that the South Korean DVD was multi-lingual with Mongolian, Mandarin, and Russian, plus English subtitles, although not widescreen. So I gambled and purchased. The VHS in contrast has all three languages, English subtitles, and is widescreen. Amazon reviewers have complained about the (apparently now already rare) Russian DVD because it only has Russian audio, dubbing over all the Mongolian and Mandarin that comprise the majority of the movie script. Well, the South Korean DVD has now arrived. It (1) has only the Russian dubbing and not the Mongolian or Mandarin, (2) isn't widescreen, (3) is blurrier visually than the VHS, and (4) is somewhat too bleached out some visually, compared to the VHS with its panoramas of the green Mongolian steppes. My conclusion then is that the VHS version is the only good version available currently, at least until Criterion or whoever performs a fix and issues a standard American DVD, or somebody adds English subtitles to the last nine of the eleven YouTube installments of the movie. Anyway, in my 66 years, I have watched 2500-3000 movies, close to half of which are foreign, and this particular movie is one of my 5 all-time favorites. But the Russian-only, with the dubbing, of the South Korean DVD, isn't any better than what one gets with the Russian DVD, and the visual quality is likely worse, if you can even find and obtain the Russian DVD anymore. So in summary I'm giving three stars because the movie is five stars but the South Korean DVD version is one star. I might mention in passing that this is not the case with all South Korean DVDs I've bought. The South Korean DVD of The Accompanist (France, 1992), for example, another movie for which there's a VHS but no American DVD, is perfectly fine. Not so the case here.",1453161600,2,2205,4.835978835978836

Heartfelt movies are in short supply.  Somebody should snag the right to this film and do justice to it.

8432740,5,B004KDVMRS," Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:
 Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!

I watched this lyrical movie at a local independent film movie theater in 1992 and there is something about this film that still draws me back to watch it sometimes.  This movie portrays a lifestyle from a time when more of the world lived a life that was more rural, idyllic, rustic, simple, and uncomplicated.

A traditional simple-minded Mongolian man, Gombo, marries a more sophisticated Mongolian city girl, Pagma, but continues his traditional shepherd life out on the sweeping steppes of Inner Mongolia in China.  Their family meets a Russian truck driver, Sergei, after Sergei accidentally drives his truck into a creek.  Sergei stays with the family at their ger (yurt) for awhile before he and Gombo drive into town because Gombo has been instructed by his wife to buy condoms (to prevent them from having more children due to China laws) and a television (to become more informed and less of a ""barbarian"", as his wife refers to him).

Fantasy and surrealism interplay with stark realism in this film.  Comedy contrasts with introspection.  While sitting outside ignorantly staring at a newly-purchased television that is unwrapped and placed in the middle of the steppe fields without any source of electrical power, Gombo has a dream that his relative, Uncle Bayartou, has become Genghis (Chinggis) Khan and his wife has become Genghis' wife.  Uncle Bayartou weaves in and out of this movie as a drunken happy-go-lucky nomad, riding his likewise seemingly drunken horse both outside and through indoor hallways.  Bayartou seems to not have any permanent home or occupation, perhaps a symbol of the Mongolian culture's nomadic past, and yet he rides all over the place giving out little gifts to everyone.  He gives Gombo a movie poster that advertises Sylvester Stallone in the 1986 action film, ""Cobra"", and tells them that the poster is a photograph of his brother in the U.S. On the screen of the unplugged television sitting in the middle of the field, Sylvester Stallone's Rambo character is overlaid onto images of Chinggis Khan, a juxtaposition of the old and the new, the past and the present.

A scene that shows Gombo humanely slaughtering a sheep for the evening supper meal looks like a you-are-there documentary with the way it was filmed, depicting the traditional ways of the Mongols out on the steppes, as Sergei purposely sits facing away from the butchering and cooking that is going on.  The sheep is really killed, cut up, and cooked in the movie, but the animal's death is surprisingly quick, peaceful, and quiet, with a minimal amount of blood and mess.  The entire family helps to slaughter and cook the sheep for dinner in honor of their unexpected Russian guest.  Even though Sergei later enjoys eating the cooked sheep, as a city-dweller, he is likely more accustomed to seeing his meats already butchered, cleaned, and packaged.  This scene had me wondering how many of us can really stomach the sight of our cows, pigs, and chickens being slaughtered and how they are processed before the meats are displayed in our grocery stores all hermetically sealed inside styrofoam and plastic wrap.

Gombo's young daughter, Bourma, is adept at playing accordion, while her grandmother quietly sits in the ger squeezing and popping bubble wrap.  The traditional clashes with the modern when Gombo rides into the bustling town on his horse, surrounded by bicycles and cars.  Sergei feels like a stranger in Gombo's primitive and simplistic life, and when Gombo rides into the city on his horse, he feels like a stranger in a foreign land, especially while perusing the condoms at the pharmacy counter.  This movie's title is called both ""Urga"" and ""Close To Eden"" as there are various symbolisms at play with the Eden reference.  Gombo is like Adam and Pagma is like Eve in their Mongolian Eden.  Uncle Bayartou even rides by and gives them an apple.  Sergei bemoans the loss of Russian soul and traditions and his inability to remember and appreciate the past.  By contrast, even though Gombo tells stories of Genghis Khan to his son and teaches his son to appreciate the simple beauties of watching a dragonfly and looking at rainbows, he feels compelled to join the 20th century and trade his traditions for some comforts of modern life.

The movie ends with a voiceover by Gombo and Pagma's fourth son.  Although Gombo buys a television when he and Sergei drive into town, he never does buy the condoms, perhaps because he felt embarrassed that the pharmacy's counter was entirely staffed by women.  In spite of lacking birth control, the couple decides to engage in physical intimacy anyway.  The location where Gombo once placed his urga (lasso) as a do-not-disturb sign to alert other passersby to not intrude upon their physical intimacy, which resulted in their fourth son, has been replaced by a smokestack chimney spewing black smoke into the sky.  ""The smokestack can be seen very well from the window in the big house where I now live."" says Gombo's son.  So even though Gombo's son can now, unlike his father, afford to live more comfortably in his ""big house"" instead of living in a ger yurt, the beautiful steppe scenery with its rolling hills has been blemished by the pollution that accompanies modern life.

Prior to acting in this film, the actor who plays Gombo, ""Bayaertu"", had never performed in any movies before, and the actress who plays Pagma, ""Badema"", had only performed in one previous film.  But both Bayaertu and Badema performed very well in this movie, with their acting and subtle nuances of facial expressions, like more professional method actors who are immersing themselves in their roles of Mongols still living the traditional Mongolian life out on the steppes while becoming aware of the need to modernize with the 20th century way of life in the cities.  Although this may seem like an obscure foreign art film to Westerners, the Russian movie director Nikita Mikhalkov is very well-known in Russia.  The actor who plays the Russian truck driver Sergei, Vladimir Gostyukhin, is also very well-known in Russia as he has acted in numerous television roles.  Sergei has the sheet music to a popular Russian war song, ""On the Hills of Manchuria"", tattooed on his back.  This song is a haunting waltz with sad patriotic lyrics about the battle of Mukden during the Russian-Japanese war of 1904 when the Russians were defeated by the Japanese.  Sergei also sings the song twice, once in a Chinese club and again with Bourma playing accordion.

Unlike many movies where the director may demand numerous retakes to perfect a scene, this movie has a certain unpolished raw feel to it.  I imagine that the director filmed only a single shoot of the sheep being really killed, instead of filming that scene again with another live sheep.  While Sergei is dining with the Mongolian family after they cook the sheep, a fly actually lands inside Sergei's bowl of soup and dies.  Sergei grumbles a bit, picks the fly out of his soup, and continues eating the soup.  This scene would not have been included in most Hollywood movies because the director would have considered that to be a blooper outtake and reshot the scene, or the actor would have refused to continue eating the soup after a fly had died inside his soup bowl.  In contrast to Hollywood movies that rely on action, car chases, guns, and explosions, this movie is much more quiet, contemplative, and slow in its pacing.  But the sparseness of this movie still speaks volumes about both the good and bad aspects of modern life.

Since this movie is a trilingual experience with Russian, Mongolian, and Mandarin Chinese being spoken, I must comment on the availability of this movie on DVD with English subtitles since there are various confusing versions of this DVD out there, and there is currently only ONE version of this movie worth buying on DVD if you need English subtitles (and you will need subtitles unless you can understand Mongolian, Russian, and Mandarin).

Originally, there was just the VHS tape version available on Amazon:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Close-to-Eden-VHS/dp/6302884810/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Close to Eden [VHS</a>], showing a woman standing in a red dress.  This VHS version does have English subtitles, and although this is a VHS tape that is not as durable as the DVD media, this version is a faithful reproduction of the original theatrical release, with accurate English translations.

There is a version of this movie that displays no subtitles,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Urga-Close-to-Eden-NO-ENGLISH/dp/B0001X0UAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Urga / Close to Eden [NO ENGLISH</a>].  The DVD box cover shows Gombo and Pagma looking out with their yurt and horses in the background.  So if you need to view this movie with English subtitles, avoid this version.

There is a DVD version that has English subtitles, but the ""Ruscico"" Russian film distributor totally ruined the movie by overdubbing Russian speech onto both the Mongolian and the Mandarin speech:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Urga-Close-to-Eden-English-Subtitles/dp/B003H5HGCU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Urga / Close to Eden [English, Subtitles</a>].  The DVD box cover for this version shows the mustached director Nikita Mikhalkov standing next to a camera.  When I watch a foreign film, I would MUCH rather listen to the original speech and read subtitles instead of listening to speech that has been overdubbed just for the convenience of not having to read subtitles.  On top of the poor job of overdubbing the speech, the English subtitle translation has been mangled in this version of the DVD and the sound quality is very poor.  Avoid this DVD version.

Since this movie was a joint collaboration between French and Russian crews, on the Amazon France Web site, there is also a French version of this DVD in PAL Region 2 format; that DVD box cover shows the urga lasso stick planted into the ground with the fields of the Mongolian steppes in the background.  I do not know if that version has English subtitles.

Since I wanted to add this movie to my DVD collection, I managed to find a DVD that does have accurate English subtitles matching the subtitles used during the theatrical release, and NO OVERDUBS!  On the Amazon U.K. Web site, there is an all-regions compatible DVD being offered that has both Korean and English subtitles.  The box cover for this DVD shows Gombo riding his white horse and holding his urga lasso stick.  The Amazon U.S. Web site also currently stocks this Korean-version import here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Urga-DVD-Import-Korea/dp/B004KDVMRS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Urga DVD Import Korea</a>.  This Korean version has both optional Korean and English subtitles, and, most importantly, the original Russian, Mongolian, and Mandarin audio is preserved and retained.  I received a 4:3 full-screen (cropped) version.  Unfortunately, a wide-screen version of this movie is not available, which would have been better in showing the wide open spaces of the Mongolian steppes.  The DVD transfer quality on this Korean version is not that good, but not terrible either, with subpar sound quality for a DVD, looking like it was just a transfer from the VHS tape version of the movie.  The two-hour movie is divided into just four chapters on the DVD, and there are no other ""Extra Features"" on this DVD.  But I am glad that I found this Korean version!  Unless another better DVD version of this movie is later released, this Korean version is currently the best version of this movie and the video, audio, and subtitles are identical to the original U.S. theatrical release.  This movie's director is still very active in Russia, both with directing and acting roles, but I doubt that a Blu-ray version of this movie will ever be released.  A Blu-ray 1080P DTS-HD MA 5.1-channel wide-screen release of this movie, along with subtitled commentary by the director and actors, would be awesome and I would buy it, but this will likely never happen.",1352764800,12,12268,5.172570850202429
