Neither Miriya nor Max die in this movie. If you watch the unedited version you will see them briefly in two scenes during the final battle. Pay attention. They're both operating Meltrandy(sic) Power armour.",1033948800,,376,4.984126984126984
686998,5,6303501141,"This movie takes
the Robotech theme to the limit. I like Robotech, but since Robotech was targeted at a young audience, the violence and intensity of the fighting wasn't shown in its entirety. Also in Robotech you had the soap opera mentality to it, which kinda made me bored in some episodes. Finally Robotech has a lot of loose ends , the awful Robotech 2 Sentinels movie only made matters worse.
This movie tells the real tale of MACROSS (Robotech was the English name for Macross) and its real conclusions to the characters involved like Max and Miria. Whereas in the tv series they fall in love , in this movie they fight to the death (who falls in love during combat anyway) and its the REAL ending between them.
The mecha designs were and are revolutionary (Tatsunuko Productons and Bandai), and the character development done here is excellent done brilliantly by Shoji Kawamori and NOT Carl Macek. There is absolutely no flaw in this film and thats why 15 yrs to 18 yrs later it still beats the ... American cartoons and bad cartoons in general.
Get the uncut version as the American dubbed version
is horrible. The uncut Japanese version
 has never been commercially released except in its birthplace Japan. Luckily several auction sellers sold off copies to lucky buyers.
 ... Watch this film, you won't regret.
Now available on DVD. Also Robotech BattleCry for PS2, Xbox
and Gameboy Advance, based on the movie and series are
coming out!!! Macross rules!!!",1032998400,2,1468,4.798418972332016
686999,2,6303501141,"I'm sure it's been said, but this movie is the original 1984 movie, ""Macross 1984: Ai, oboete imasu ka? (Do you remember love?)"".  An earlier review said this was released to theaters in the US as ""Robotech: The Movie"", and that is untrue; that was a dubbed/reedited version of Megazone 23, a totally different movie.  *This* movie was only released in the US on video as ""Clash of the Bionoids"" and now rereleased with the original ""Macross"" title.
 ""Ai, oboete imasu ka?"" is a two hour movie of one of the best anime to come out of Japan.  It has *incredible* animation a terrific story to boot.
The story is basically a compressed version of the original Macross series (as distinguished from Robotech - I also love that, but it is *not* the original story of Macross) from approx episode 4 to episode 27, although it's been mismashed and reordered to make a similar, but different storyline.  For example, Minmay is already famous and Hikaru is already in the military (and they're both already in deep space) before they ever meet.  The same basic events happen, but not in the same way.  It's actually pretty neat.  In ""Macross, A Future Chronicle"" on the Macross Plus LD #1, this is explained as this movie being a ""historical"" movie about ""real"" events made *in the Macross universe* years after the first Space War.
HOWEVER, the version for sale here is dubbed, and really badly. Part of what made the real movie so great was the voice acting, and this one is missing it entirely.  If you must see this movie, and I mean MUST, then this would be a decent rental choice, but not purchase.  For less money you can go on Ebay and get a DVD or VCD with the original movie with subs (which is likely a bootleg, however).  Maybe one day Animeigo or a similar company will get the buzz and put a GOOD subbed version out, but in the meantime, most people will have to deal with this.
Bottom line: if you can find this subbed, GET THAT ONE.  If you cannot wait to see ir for the animation only, then rent this.  But don't buy it.",1011916800,6,2029,4.466124661246613
687000,3,6303501141,"Harmony Gold first released this to America as Robotech: Clash of the Bionoids and actually put in some theaters as Robotech the Movie.  Which was actually an edited version of the movie you see before you now, Macross Super Dimensional Fortress.  They did a hack job trying to convert this movie, based on the Japanese Macross series, to the American Robotech series.  Actually, no conversion was actually done other then the cutting of some violent scenes(i.e. Zentradi commando gets turned into swiss cheese by Miriam), hence all the characters still go by their Japanese names: Hikaru(Rick), Misa(Lisa). Which confused a lot of Robotech fans, but in turn introducing them to the series' true roots, Macross.  Anyhow, this version is the original movie in full and uncut with all the original scenes deleted by Harmony Gold and bad dubbing included.  In terms of Anime though, this one definately goes down in the history books as a major player.  After all these years, the animation still holds its own against newer stuff released today.
As many Robotech fans should know by now, what America knows to be the Robotech series, was actually based on 3 different Japanese Anime series that actually had no continuity between one another.  Macross(Robotech Generation 1), Southern Cross(Generation 2), and Mospeada(Generation 3).  Through some creative writing and dubbing, Harmony Gold (who acquired exclusive licensing rights to those 3 series for American release) managed to connect these series together forming the American Robotech saga.  The Macross movie you see before you is actually based off of the Japanese movie Macross: Do You Remember Love, which is essentially a condensed version of the Japanese Macross series.  Keeping in continuity though, this series would later spawn Macross II(OAV series), Macross Plus, and Macross 7.
If you can't find a good subtitled version, then this is your only choice for a piece of Macross history.  Or you can always hope they'll release a digitally re-mastered DVD version in the future.",1004745600,4,2043,5.198170731707317
687001,1,6303501141,I had to get this movie after seeing a clip on the Internet (subbed).  The dog fight sequence between max and the zentradi woman is simply awesome.  The kitschy music from the 80's is strangely enjoyable and nostalgic.  But the dub is so so so terribly bad to the point that I could not enjoy the movie.  Do yourself a favor and find the Subbed one.  This one will make you regret that you didn't.,1002067200,,397,4.24
687002,5,6303501141,"I was waiting for years to watch this movie, and when I'd finally get it, I'm proud to say this is the best movie I've never see before, because I'm deep inside of the Macross Serie's, here in Mexico best known as ""Robotech"", when the Triangle Love between Lisa, Rick & Minmey it's become more difficult.
The movie has good sound, the effects are from the 80's but it's enough for the story, the translation it's regular but understandble and the story, the story it's very good. Also, it's different from the Macross Series, because the story began from the Episode 27, when Zentraedi attack the Earth and continue in space the rest of the story... I recommend you the movie, that's great... at least, it's to me.
Well, I'll do not tell you the finnish, but it's the only one thing that doesn't like me. But may be it likes you.

687004,3,6303501141,"Until last year, I never really thought of me as a Macross fan. Sure, I watched Robotech a couple of times and even bought Macross Plus for the cool mecha designs. But one night, while zapping on my TV I catched this movie (spanish dub, i'm a peruvian) and I went crazy. I loved every single second of it, from the initial launch of the Valkyries to the final accords of Lynn Minmei's Ai Oboeteimasuka(Do you remember love?, in the original Japanese). I was stunned by the visual beauty of this production (it's animation can stand up even to the Evangelion movie. Well, not really, but it's REALLY good for 1984). Although in many sites people complain about not being able to understand the plot (""only for fans who had already watched the original TV series""), I didn't have any problem, in fact, I found it quite simple. I finally understood them when I watched the english dub, and that's the reason why this item only gets 3 stars. Really bad acting (even the spanish voice actors vere WAY better). Don't go and buy this tape in english if possible. Go, run to your local fansubbers and buy the subbed japanese version. Or, if you can understand spanish and have access to the Locomotion Channel, go and tape it. Just buy this one as a very last resort, because without the good voices, you have already lost half of the taste of this superb production. But that's all you loose. The animation is still there, the plot is still there and Hikaru Ichijo, Lynn Minmei and Misa Hayase and the rest of the unforgetable cast is still there.",983145600,,1540,4.543165467625899
687005,4,6303501141,"Macross the Movie (orginially released in Japan as Macross: Do you Remember Love) is the retelling of Macross the Television series created by the famed Shoji Kawamori who has brought many great anime and manga to life. First released in the United States as Clash of the Bionoids, a horribly dubbed and butchered version of an otherwise beautifully animated experience. The soundtrack to the movie is par-excellance. Though the dubbing is not as good as it could have been, it is still a must buy for any fan of Macross, Robotech, Anime, or all things Japanese.",981763200,2,562,4.864583333333333
687006,5,6303501141,"The Super Dimension Fortress Macross is my favourite animation, for a length of 6 years. When young, I have been hearing my friends talking about a huge robot with aircraft carriers as arms. Till 6 years ago, I bought a set of Macross the TV series. I spent only 2 days watching the whole animation and I was completely absorbed by it. I often compare this series with that of the Gundam series, and I actually find that Macross is much better than the Gundam series. Most people who watched Macross would agree with this, including all my friends and myself. People whom watched Gundam refuse to watch Macross, the reason being that they don't want their favourite animation to be defeated. Robotech is an animation that is developed from Macross, and is for children, young children. It is actually a combination of another 2 animation, and the overall product seems to be for children, very young children. Of course, Macross is targeted at adults. It has the ability to make you sad and angry;it is more realistic. Robotech started off by using Macross as an introduction, then switches to the other animations. Despite these modifications that lowered the quality of the original animation, a lot of people are attracted to Robotech. If so many people are addicted to Robotech, I believe even more people love Macross. Macross was formerly an alien battleship that crashed on earth. After 10 years of repairing and modification, it finally sets off and due to a failure in folding, It landed somewhere very far from earth. Half the story is on how Macross gets back to earth, and the other half is mostly on some romance. More than half of the story is on war, and another minor bit on romance( Macross is also a little of a love story). This series carries on well, and you won't get lost if you follow each episode. Macross too, have a collection of songs. All of them are sung by Lynn Minmay. Actually, without Lynn Minmay, the Macross series wouldn't be so successful. Almost each time Minmay sings, there will be a miracle of some sort. In both Macross the TV series and the movie ""Do you remember love"", Minmay songs enable victory because it causes the enemies to fight themselves. It may seem funny to people who haven't watched the animation, but it is all right for us because the animation explains what effect the ""protoculture"" had on the huge enemies. In other words, the movie is self-explanatory.  Macross is suitable for both robot lovers as well as romance lovers. Actually, it is suitable for everyone. When I was young, I was attracted to the SDF-1 Macross itself. (I was a robot lover) Till I was older, I finally fully understand the story and I found it even better. Usually, people compare Macross with the Gundam series. The Gundams in the series are always the hero. They can face numerous enemies with a single Gundam, which I think is unrealistic. The Gundam X series, the Gundam Double X could destroy thousands of enemies with just the satellite cannon. Unrealistic. In the Macross series, the SDF-1 Macross itself is always the one running away. More realistic, I would say, for the enemies have more troops then them. So far, I still believe that this animation is undefeatable; it is the best animation I can find, and the best I believe you can find. I had no regrets buying this animation, for I spent all my savings (Savings till that that year) on the most expensive edition. More value for money, I would say.  Macross the movie ""Do you remember love"" is rather similar to the TV series, with all the same outcomes, but some different causes. For example, Roy was killed by some bullets during an invasion in the TV series, but in the Movie he was killed by a punch from an enemy. Both at different locations, but he died in the end. In the TV series, SDF-1 Macross had its twin cannon (Macross cannon) destroyed by firing its cannon for he last time, but in the Movie, the cannons are destroyed by an energy shot from the enemy. As I said, different causes but same ending. Macross the movie ""Do you remember love"" is a short summary of Macross the TV series. It is as good, and the song ""Do you remember love"" is terrific. Macross the movie ""Do you remember love"" is better enjoyed after watching the TV series, the 36 episodes of them. Macross the TV series was created a long time ago, in the 1980s, so don't expect graphics that are too good. However, Macross the movie has reasonably good graphics.",976838400,2,4447,4.627848101265823
687046,1,6303501141,"One review of this film fermly stated ""Anyone interested in this movie should get themselves an uncut, fansubbed version. In its dubbed form, this movie is very poor."" another reviewer pointed out  ""...possibly the worst dub there is in existence in all of anime, or  probably any other media, for that matter..."". The basic plot follows  ""Humanity, lost in deep space, is at war with the powerful race called  the Zentraedi. Using their powerful Valkyrie fighters they fight back in an  attempt to stave off total annihilation."" Superdimentional Fortress  Macross is also available in a edited version for younger children, called  ""Macross: Clash of the Bionoids"". From what I gather, there is  also a versionsubtitled called ""Do you remember love?"" The film  is meant to summarize the entire ""Macross"" series, also called  ""Robotech"". But is it worth seeing?
First the positive. The art  and animation are exceptionaly good for their age. What really stood out  was the detail of the mechs, which are incredible detailed(at least some of  them). One interesting thing about the art was that the artist incorperated  seventies style into the character designs. The macross outfits looked  similar to bellbottems. Unfortunatly, this anime suffers from a lack of  action, but from the several, the battles where suprisenly good. Sadely,  the excellent frame rates and smooth character movements were hampered by  poor picture quality.
Though it was meant to be precieved as a drama,  some of the scenes seemed so pumped full of sap, or so unbelievable that  they were impossible to take seroiusly. There is one scene where Minmei is  falling down the side of Macross for about three minutes. In a mech, Hikaru  makes pathetic attemps to grab Minmei as she is falling. This  ""thrilling"" is comical at best. Another ""thrilling""  scene to watch for is when Hikaru gets into a battle.....with a training  mech, incapable of fighting. The romantic stuff is so sappy and  predictable. Here's an example of a romantic scene. Note that extremly over  dramatic music is evident.(I cant remember the female particapant in this  scenes name).
Hikaru: I'm going to explore the area.
Girl: I'll stay  here
Hikaru: (suspicous) Why?
Girl: I just want to.
Hikaru:  Alright.
(as Hikaru explores, Girl takes some very rusty, broken  silverwar....)
Hikaru: I'm back.
Hikaru: Oh Wow!
(Girl and Hikaru  proceed to have a imagianary tea party. But when a glass is found in a  puddle of water.........)
Girl: (bursts into tears) I can't take it  anymore!
Girl: I miss my (blah ,blah blah blah. She babbles on and on  about the possible loss of her friends. Hikaru then embraces her and kisses  her while overly dramatic music tortures your ear drums.)
Aparantly,  these people don't know the meaning of suttle.
But what really ruined  this movie was the dubbing. Its like the actors strived to sound as  animated as possible, with laughable results. The line ""You can't  imagine what a thrill it is"" line has to be heard to be believed.  I  didn't mind Hikaru that much, but Minmei and her rival in Hikaru's love  were unpleaseant. Minmei's awful voice sounded like she was swedish, and  her singing was  awful (or maybe it was her material). The other girl (I  still can't recall her name) cried as much as the ""Tenchi Muyo  Universe"" Mioshi. The girl also used horrible hair conditioner. Her  hair floats when she's overjoyed!
Equally poor was the dialouge and  plot. The plot is blatantly predictable. Me and my brother could  sucessfully predict what the characters were going to say and do.
All in  all, there are better animes you could spend your money on. In fact there  are better manga that are definitly worth your cash. In fact, I could think  of tons of stuff you should spend your cash on. Overall, if you are feeling  like a movie poorly dubbed, and you want to get some laughs in, this is a  pretty good bet. Its pretty funny, but if you want something serious,  you'll need it subtitled.",959817600,3,3981,4.886056971514243
687047,3,6303501141,"The first time I saw 'SDF Macross', I was amazed by the animation. For many years, the artwork was the standard for other anime features to be compared to. It featured a story similar to what was witnessed in the  original 'Macross' TV series, which was adapted in the U.S. into the first  generation of the Robotech saga. It featured the SDF-1, redesigned  Zentraedi (Exedore with a pulsating head, for example), and the classic  love triangle between Hikaru ('Rick Hunter'), Misa Hayase ('Lisa Hayes'),  and Lynn Minmei. But it also had some new twists and surprises. The movie  became so popular, it is now considered the canonical (""true"")  beginning of the Macross mythos, rather than the series. Continued in  ""Macross II"" and ""Macross Plus"".
The only problem to  me, as most would agree, is the English dub. It brings things down quite a  few notches. It's a lot like the voice-over soundtrack you'd hear in a  Godzilla flick. Maybe I'd expect that from 'Rodan', but not 'Macross'.  However...
'Superdimensional Fortress Macross' is available in  English-subtitled VHS format, known as 'Macross '84: Do You Remember  Love?'. I've seen this rendition, and consider it to be exceedingly  superior to the English dub edition. Unfortunately, it has seen a limited  release, mainly in the UK, and is extremely hard to find stateside. If  you're able to track it down, this is the version I recommend you  get.

Give credit where it's due, Shoji Kawamori (Every Macross,  Vision of Escaflowne) didn't waste his time with this movie.

7851057,5,6303501141,"As one of the first movie adaptations of an existing anime TV series, this was intended as a remake of the original Super Dimensional Fortress Macross, which in America comprised the first story arc of Robotech. It's one of the few anime movies to be available directly on DVD and Blu-Ray from Japan, but it's English release was first done in the 80s on VHS through various bootleg companies of the mediocre British dub, sometimes under the title of Macross: The Movie, or an abbreviated version of the dub called Clash Of The Bionoids which was endlessly screened on syndicated and cable TV. The movie was directed by TV series creators Shoji Kawamori and Noboru Ishiguro, so it was handled with the upmost care of transitioning the plot of the anime show to the big screen.

 The movie starts out sometime after the Macross has already left Earth after the gigantic alien humanoids known as the Zentradi have invaded, and they are now around Saturn with their enemies in pursuit. The Macross itself is a giant transformable space fortress with a thriving city inside, although whether this version of Macross was originally an alien ship that accidently picked up a town on Earth on it's maiden voyage like in the TV series is never explained. Ace jet-robot pilot Hikaru Ichijyo(Rick Hunter in Robotech)rescues the local idol singer Minmay after the Macross is attacked, and the two spend sometime sealed off from the rest of the ship, which results in a scandal. Hikaru's commanding officer Misa lays him a big reprimand, even though it's kinda obvious that there's some chemistry between the two. Afterwards, Minmay has Hikaru take him out on a flight in his mecha around Saturn's rings, but Misa along with flight commander Roy Fokker come after them, which results in all of them getting captured by the Zentradi. The aliens interrogate them to find out why the male and female humans live together and have this lost thing they refer to as ""Protoculture"". They get infiltrated by the Meltrandi, the female Zentrandi army, and Hikaru manages to escape with Misa, but Roy sacrifices himself, leaving Minmay behind. Hikaru and Misa make their way to what is left of Earth to which they find no survivors after the initial Zentradi invasion. They do find the remains of a lost city that rised from the ocean after the invasion, and discover that mankind came from the same race as the Zentradi. The Macross finally homes in on them at the lost city, and the Zentradi later show up to negotiate peace after learning more about their lost Protoculture from Minmay. Minmay is thrilled to see Hikaru again, but doesn't at first pick up on the relationship he's developed with Misa. The Meltrandi arrive to fight the combined Macross and Zentradi forces, but the main Zentradi fleet decides to just wipe out the humans and Meltandi in one sweep along with any of their own forces that get in the way. Misa in the meanwhile has translated an ancient Zentradi love song that she believes will shock all the quarreling sides into stopping the war, but Hikaru has to talk Minmay into doing it. After finally seeing the bigger picture, Minmay puts aside her personal feelings, and her song unifies the Mentradi, Macross, and Zentradi allied forces into taking down the Zentradi hierarchy. After an epic space battle, the new union set out to create a brave new world.

Do You Remember Love is considered to be the epic of anime brilliance at the time up until the Akira movie came out. The original anime mixed transforming robots, epic space opera, and one of the first anime love triangles. The movie carries the idea further with much sharper animation and drama, despite the fact that it could use a bit more of a solid origin. This was followed by a OVA music video special containing some new material titled Macross: Flash Back 2012. Some of the other Macross titles like Macross II, Macross 7, and Macross Plus are allegedly in the same continuity as the movie and not direct sequals to the TV series, but their standing the official timeline usually depends on the viewer as there are elements from the movie that never showed up in the series. Whether you've seen any of the other Macross or Robotech titles is slightly irrelevant to enjoying this movie though.

What prevented this from getting 5 stars is that the subtitles are in white and not in yellow outlined in black as they ought to be. When the Zentradi and Meltrandi speak in their language there are subtitles on the screen in Japanese for the original audience. While this is cool, and as an otaku I can appreciate it, the English subtitles that appear over it for English speaking audiences blur in with the white Japanese subtitles. Also, the ending with Minmay's concert seems to have been shoe-horned into the DVD and the picture quality of the ending concert is obviously a from VHS and not as crisp and clear as the rest of the feature.

This great classic may not be available here anymore but you can still find copies at a very reasonable cost at the Lake Anime dot com web site.

This version of the movie, ""The Super Dimension Fortress Macross Do You Remember Love, Perfect Edition"", released by Crescent Media, is really GREAT!! More details on the movie in a moment.  The big question was why was it so d@%$# hard to find this movie with a Macross search???

I'd been searching for the Macross Movie: Do You Remember Love for a very long time but only found it by accident here when looking at other movie recommendations located on the description pages for other versions of the Macross saga.  This movie version should have turned up when doing a regular Macross search but it didn't. Even searching by the complete title would not bring up this particular listing. The only way to bring up this listing was to enter Macross The Movie. But fortunately it looks like Amazon has fixed this issue or maybe it was because I added some new tags to the movie description. It now shows up if you do a search on just Macross.

Now as for what you get for the money, the movie set consists of the movie DVD and an audio CD that contains the soundtrack for the movie.  The movie is in color, NTSC with Dolby Digital 5.1 sound tracks for both Japanese and English.  Run time for the movie is 115 minutes.

Getting to the movie itself, bear in mind that the movie version is considerably different from the Macross series itself as it is a film adaptation that is a re-imaging of the original series and contains new animation. So it doesn't really fit into the normal Macross timeline even though it relates the Macross' voyage back to earth from Pluto orbit. It was originally written as an alternate-universe retelling of the Macross story.  Nevertheless it has become established as a part of the Macross universe.

So you will find some sharp differences in how the relationships between Hikaru, Minmay and Misa are handled as well as some differences in what happens to other major characters in the show. Given the compressed time frame, a lot of details on the relationships are left out. But in spite of that the characters and story line are fairly solid and believable in terms of their reactions and feelings. In fact I think the love stories are actually intensified because of the pacing and focused character development.

**SPOILER ALERT** In a way, I think this re-imaging or the original series is a good thing since one of the principal characters dies bravely and nobly instead of dying needlessly and pointlessly, due to macho stupidity, as he does in the original series. The revelation of one of earth's most ancient mysteries is also handled superbly. I won't say more so as not to spoil it further for those who haven't seen this movie yet. **END SPOILERS**

Another good point in my opinion is the way they handle the musical themes. I think it is superior to the original series. In particular, unlike the original series, they did not play ""My Boyfriend Is A Pilot"" to death and they have a magnificent key song (Do You Remember Love) sung by Lynn Minmay for the climactic final battle scenes whereas the original series has no principal song for the final battle sequence. You can also hear this signature song over the sounds of the battle which was not the case in the original series. The story line of how the signature song is put together is also excellent.

This version of the movie itself is really excellent. The images are razor sharp, and crystal clear with excellent color saturation and good detail even in the shadows. I viewed this with a Blu-Ray player that up converts regular DVDs and outputs the image via HDMI to a Hi-Def 65"" flat screen combined with a 7.1 audio system.

The sound tracks available are Dolby Digital English 5.1 and Dolby Digital Japanese 5.1.  The audio quality of the Japanese track is excellent while the English track is not so good. It sounds slightly muffled somehow and not as crisp and clear as the Japanese soundtrack.

After watching it in both Japanese and English dub, I've got to strongly recommend you go with the Japanese version with English subtitles.  The Japanese audio version is definitely superior in audio quality compared to the English version, and the Japanese voice actors do a superb job of projecting the feelings and attitudes of the various characters.

The English dub cast, with the exception of the person playing Minn May's part (Mari Iijima), are really very poor.  They sound like they are reading the script for the first time and don't really care about what they are doing or saying. Their performance is stilted, dull and bored.  It also appears that both the English dub and subtitles don't do a very good job of translating the Japanese in the English version. You'll note that in the English version there is a big difference between what the dub actors say versus what the subtitles say at the same time.

The English subs on the Japanese version though appear to be spot on.

All in all this is a terrific production of the movie version and should be a must have for your collection if you are a fan of Macross.  The price is reasonable and the DVD is an ALL region dvd that should play in any player.

One other thing I should have mentioned is that this version of the movie has no extras on it BUT it does come with an audio CD of the movie soundtrack which includes the hit song, ""Do You Remember Love?"" (Ai Oboete Imasu Ka), which was sung by Lynn Minmay (Mari Iijima) at the height of the final battle.  That alone makes it a must have in my book.",1306108800,6,5691,4.60435212660732
7851064,5,6303501141,"I don't see what the big deal about the subs are,sure it's flat and the recording was kinda awefull and there is virtualy no chemistry between the characters ..but the animation is great and it's unedited and with all the orignal footage from do you remember love,aside from the animation in the credits,it's still worthwhile because it is in english and full screen.

7851065,5,6303501141,"I see lots of reviews and many of them lump these products into one. This is understandable as they are in reality 2 cuts of the same movie. The original japanese is Super Dimensional Fortrss Macross Do you remember love or Macross 84 Love do you remember depending on the translator(which is now available subtitled on DVD and is worthy to find). In 1984 this movie was so sucessful in japan that TOHO (yes the godzilla people) and BIG west dubbed it for release in the Englsh speaking pacific rim (Hong kong australia etc). So was born Super Space fortess Macross. While not an exact dub it has the basics of the original japanese translation. for those that blast the ating and transaltion i challenge with this fact, the english cut was used as an english language learning tool back in Japan with japanese subtitles. In the early 90's after the sucess of robotech in the US toho was using the one license harmony gold didn buy DYRL and peddled it to Just for kids. this is CLash of the bionoids&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Macross-Clash-of-the-Bionoids/dp/B00000F4U0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Macross: Clash of the Bionoids</a>&nbsp;which cut out 40 minutes of footage including heavy gore, the Minmay shower scene nudity and a slow part of Misa and Ikaru stranded. It is otherwise identical to the english Dub I talked about earlier. This is the one kids can watch but odds are they will get bored at times. MAcross is 115 min long and have not compared it with the LD Super Space fortress macross but I suspect it is also missing the shower scene both tapes are Full frame. at this time the original 2 hr 5 miute long english dub is not on DVD and the was only released on LAserdisc in the late 80's. I first saw this movie as bionoids buying it as a robotech fan and knowing Macross was the source for the first chapter of Robotech.  I was a late teen then and later aquired the laserdisc for the full length widescreen version (but the japanese subtitles distract from the amazing visuals).
it is a great film it is a lot deeper than the mindless anime of today.  yes the actors are a little ""wooden"" a times but the transation is very close to the original. well worth the prices of used VHS for any Robotech or macross fan.",1178841600,,2282,4.76010101010101
7851066,5,6303501141,"The VHS tape you are looking at is a dubbed version of the epic Japanese movie SUPERDIMENTIONAL FORTRESS MACROSS, DO YOU REMEMBER LOVE (DYRL).  This movie was like the Japanese Star Wars back in the 80's and has been a base for many sequels and spin-offs including Macross 2 (spin-off) and Macross Plus, and also now in production is Macross Zero which is a prequel to this movie.
This movie is a retelling of Space War I, as first detailed in the Japanese TV series.  No one will be disappointed with this film; it is simply one of the most beautiful movies ever created.
BTW: If you think that this movie has some connection with Robotech, you are wrong... Robotech is a lousy hack of the TV show in which this movie was based.",1056672000,,729,4.432835820895522
