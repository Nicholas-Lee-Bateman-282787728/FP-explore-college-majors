2259935,5,B0008KLV8M,"This dvd is really good I would recommend it for all the fans of the show! Although MTV did trick us by splitting up season 2 into two seasons. According to MTV season 2 is when Nick and Jessica celebrated their 1st year anniversary until the Valentine's Day episode, and Season 3 is from when Cacee moves in with the newlyweds up to the last episode where Jessica kicks off her new tour. So there is still SEason 4 dvd coming out (Where Jessica get's a dog, Daisy and does the Dukes of Hazzard movie).
All in all, I love this dvd. It has waaaaaaaaay more special features than the first one, it has the extra special episode of ""Happy Birthday Jess, love Nick"" As well as a bunch of deleted scenes, and an MTV timeline of the Newlyweds.
I'm just super happy that I finally was able to watch Season 3 which is where MuchMusic cut off showing Newlyweds in Canada, and where MTV canada picked it up.
I can't wait for the last and final dvd SEason 4, I hope it will have as much special features as this dvd!",1118188800,11,1005,4.239583333333333
2259936,5,B0008KLV8M,"Well, I absolutely adore the two of them as Newlyweds.  Being that I am a newlywed myself, I can totally relate to some of their moments.  Jessica is so stupidly funny, and Nick is just an amazingly graceful man to deal with her.  They are such a beautiful couple inside and out!  It is just classic Nick and Jessica.  I love the DVD's.  I watched them all over the past two days, and I enjoyed each and every episode. I know it is something I will enjoy over and over again!

However, I have lived overseas the past year, and I missed all of the episodes.  I had no idea that there were episodes missing!  I want to see them!  We should complain to MTV!  I have looked forward to watching these all year.  I have the first season as well, and I laugh each and every time like it was the first.  Thank God he brought Nick and Jessica together, because there would be no one else to entertain us.  I know I will miss the Newlyweds!",1118188800,3,930,4.151685393258427
2259937,3,B0008KLV8M,the movie just came out today how could you know all that stuff unless you had a pre order  but im too a advide watcher so im going get it for $$ money,1118188800,,151,3.5757575757575757
2259938,4,B0008KLV8M,"I am an avid Newlyweds fan, and have seen all of the seasons, and bought this today, the first day it was released. The overall dvd is great, and I love the layout on the menus a lot more than season 1. I was disappointed, however, because it is missing the real season 3!!! On mtv.com on the Newlyweds page, it says that both of the seasons on this dvd are tied into one big season 2, and season 3 is the Dukes of Hazzard season, and none of those episodes are on here. So I was kind of disappointed, but I did like the seasons on this dvd the best, so that was okay. If you liked the two parts of season 2, and don't care if season 3 is on here, I do recommend this dvd. If you do care, however, don't waste your money.",1118102400,2,721,3.9115646258503403
2259939,1,B0008KLV8M,"I bought this DVD set the day it came out & I was thouroughly disappointed!!  So disappointed with it I took it back to the store.  There is NOT one single episode on there from Season 3.

It was all the episodes in Season 2 split to make both seasons!  It is very misleading!  Me being an avid watcher was the only way I caught this.  On MTV, the whole 3rd season was basiacally about Jessica's new movie, Dukes of Hazzard.  There wasn't one single episode with that.  The last episode shown on MTV was Nick & Jessica moving, but the last episode on

""Season 3"" on the DVD set is the one where Nick plays ball with the Dodgers & him taking Jess back to the church they were married in.  Big disappointment, not worth $30!!!  Season 1 was way better!",1118102400,10,750,4.211267605633803

2259965,2,B0008KLV8M,"This season you get to still watch two spoiled young Americans too young to be married realize that they shouldn't be married. You get to listen to Jessica Simpson continue that ""Im so blond and dumb"" routine which makes me ill. You get to see her goofy dad and the rest of her dumb family. You see Nick and Jessica waste money. And you see the beginnings of the rivalry/jealousy as Jessica's career takes off while you see Nick's single career flounders.

2259991,5,B0008KLV8M,"I love Jessica Simpson ... because of who she is. She has a great down to earth normal personality, she's not stuck up and she appears to be a great friend to those around her. I don't think she should have allowed her best friend (assistant) Casey to move in with them, it made things even worse. They needed their privacy and they didn't have that with her their 24/7. I can't remember which season but on one of the episodes when they dress up for halloween like the Three's Company crew ... notice how toward the end when they are all walking out the door Casey is the last one to walk out and Nick is holding the door open ... she touches his stomach in a really flirtatious way ... i hated her ... Jessica never realized that all the tension between Nick and Casey was because they liked eachother, which is why Nick sort of argued with her sometimes. Made me sick !",1208908800,,872,4.259036144578313
2259992,4,B0008KLV8M,I thought these were really cute and was really sad that they are now divorced. But you can see from the series that this couple wouldn't last too long. Their views were just too different from each other,1185321600,,204,4.394736842105263
2259993,5,B0008KLV8M,"Ok, I bought this and I wasint at first sure if this was gun be a worth while buy or not ... but I assure You ITS the BEST, its a very intertaining show! It'll make you laugh and for sure keep your attention! I have watched all episodes over in over in even after seeing each one over ten times each I could watch it all over again and not be bored !

2260006,5,B0008KLV8M,"Very entertaining!  Jessica & Nick are so cute!  It's cool to watch how celebrities live day-by-day and have the same fights and do simple things as watching TV and laundry just like the rest of us!  It's fun to watch the young couple and how much they love each other.  Unfortunately, their sad divorce keeps it real now, and shows that NOTHING is ever perfect :(",1135382400,5,364,4.46969696969697
2260007,1,B0008KLV8M,"I find this show very boring. Like another reviewer said, all they do is travel to the recording studio, watch T.V., do laundry and fight over food. You might as well just watch your parents fight, kids. I mean, at the end of the day, they fight over food and who's grabbing the remote, don't they? They fight over who should do the laundry, right? All that's left is the recording studio part, but that's not very entertaining to watch for us...",1135382400,2,446,4.451219512195122
2260008,1,B0008KLV8M,"Oh my gaw! That other reviewer is right - I am just so, so jellllllus of Jessica and her marriage to Nick that watching these DVDs makes me want to tear my hair out and smother my husband of six years. I yearn for the life Jessie has of being: bleach-blonde, fake-tanned, married to someone whose eyes have surprisingly not fallen out of his sockets given the amount of times he rolls them at her, and whose creepy father constantly hovers around, making comments about her sex life and (...). Oh yes, jealous I am. I am soooooooo envious!

I think what I really wish I had is Jessie's intellect, ya know, that of a flea, because being stooooopid is hot, y'all. Being dumb and man-faced with (...)
Oh and getting divorced after putting your marriage on the air for three years is just THE ULTIMATE cool. It's kind of like throwing out last year's fashions, you know. So if you're dying to live Jessie's life vicariously, this is the DVD for you. ENJOY!",1134950400,2,952,4.471264367816092
2260009,5,B0008KLV8M,"I gotta say that I loved this show.  Not only did it perfectly showcase Jessica Simpson as a marketer's dream machine because of her airheady comments, but it proved that reality TV is where it's at these days.  Every episode here is a testament to Simpson's surprising mass appeal, from the hilarious Simpson commentary we've all come to love or the outrageously entertaining ""baby"" rumors.  Still, it's sad to think that this show is what made Simpson an A-lister...nevertheless, MTV's Newlyweds is IT!!",1130284800,3,505,5.0602409638554215
2260010,5,B0008KLV8M,"Dear jessica and nick, I would like to start off by telling ""ya'll"" you have such GREAT attitudes! Many cut you down, well that's not the case today! Your dvd is so real, and honest. This wasn't like it was suppose to be real serious, it was suppose to be fun! Ya'll accomplished that! To the girl that called jess DROP DEAD GORGEOUS, she is. People who say nick can't sing or need's plastic surgery, need a life! People that say jess can't sing,need a hearing aid. She's one of the best out there PEOPLE! Nick you are so sweet, and your voice is gorgeous to! Quit being mean cause their a beautiful, and beyond talented couple! This dvd rock's! Go out and get it already, if you don't have it!

She actually thought tuna was chicken (wow). Nick Lachey is a forgettable popstar who has absolutely no talent. God I'm glad they're both gone and they'll never come back.

2260013,5,B0008KLV8M,I purchased the 2nd and 3rd seasons of Newlyweds.  I hadn't seen every show but watched quite a few episodes when it was on television.  It's a hysterical show to watch and having it on DVD is a lot of fun!!,1128816000,4,207,4.024390243902439
2260014,1,B0008KLV8M,"How is Jessica Simpson, the poster-child for stupidity, able to thrive in a cut throat industry? Simple. Because equally stupid people are willing to buy it. One can come up with all the excuses in the world as to why Jessica Simpson is a star, but the fact of the matter is that she was a washed up pop-star who got lucky...becuase she is a moron (and having a Dad in the industry doesn't hurt either). Let's look at the evidence. The sales for ""In This Skin"" were abysmal when it was first released. Then her show, ""Newlyweds,"" comes along and people begin to notice how unintelligent she is, somehow think she is funny and so when she re-releases her album, the sales drastically improve. And then the video for ""With You"" showcases her eating from a can of tuna and feriously eating ""buffalo wings"" with the sauce covering her mouth and smiling as if to say ""aren't I cute."" No Jessica, not at all. You are a pig and women should be ashamed that some bimbo like you can come and destroy what feminists have been working to abolish: the notion that women are less intelligent than men and that a woman's job is to please her man. Isn't it funny how everyone praises Jessica for waiting until she was married to have sex and yet no one demonizes Nick for indulging in pre-marital intercourse? Congratulations Jessica. When you are older, you can look back at life and proudly proclaim that you sucessfully preserved antiquated notions of feminity by portraying the virgin-whore archetype. ""Hey guys, I waited until marrige to have sex (virgin), but I'm going to do photoshoots in which my finger is always seductively postioned in my mouth (whore). The photoshoot is for my new line of 'perfume,' that's why the finger is in my mouth. I would never use sexuality to sell something. I'm Jessica Simpson!

2260028,1,B0008KLV8M,"When famous people need to make a reality TV show it just shows how desperate they are for attention and money. Jessica and Nick are 2 of the dumbest people on the planet. Nick's tatoo's are painful to look at (u can have it removed by laser surgery, fool!). As for the video to 'these boots were made for walking', anyone with even a drop of class will be totally embarassed at Jessica's childish squeaking, clumsy dancing, tacky dressing and attitude. All Nick and Jessica do on the show is travel to the recording studio (as they are singers anyone would have figured out that they would drop in to record music sometime!), watching TV, doing laundry and having ridiculous fights over chicken/tuna. Tuna is a fish, Jessica, dumba--! Jessica's 'desert' products are bad quality and certainly not edible, I tried them and felt the urge to vomit! To all the newlyweds fans, Buffalo wings are made of chicken, not buffalo. Watch real TV shows like Nip/tuck, The O.C, Desperate housewives or One tree hill.

TO THE NEWLYWEDS FAN YOLANDA:

1.) Calling me 'g--' is downright ridiculous when you obviously have a huge crush on Jessica Simpson. If someone shows me a picture of an attractive lady I'll call her beautiful or pretty, not 'drop dead gorgeous' (this phrase I reserve strictly for the guys).

2.) How can u call someone 'ugly' or 'overweight' without even meeting them? Since when does being a size 6 qualify as being overweight? If so, u need to get help for anorexia.

3.) I am a first year medic, meanwhile u are living in a trailer park judging by your pathetic violent threats via amazon.com! How are u going to 'beat' me when u don't even know who I am or where I live? Loser!

4.) U are the one who has a shortage of male admirers, not me. U think Nick Lachey is gorgeous and would immediately accept if he asked u out on a date, I WOULD NOT. Nick requires a rhinoplasty (nose job) but as he is not a real man he would be too scared to have it done but if he did would want mommy to hold his hand throughout surgery.

5.)If Nick and Jessica are the 'smartest people' on the planet, then quite frankly America and the rest of the world should be concerned. Yolanda, sorry honey, u must be braindead.",1123804800,2,2211,4.47394540942928

2260044,3,B0008KLV8M,"although i loved this dvd, i have to say i was confused for a long time...... i couldn't work out where season 3 was, having checked the offical mtv website and discovering what was packaged as season 3 is actually season 2 helped clear things up a little, but still meant i didn't get what i was expecting from the dvd. still love newlyweds, but wish i had got what i thought i was paying for.",1121385600,,394,4.197368421052632

2260047,4,B0008KLV8M,"Its a testament to this show's popularity that Britney Spears decided to have her own reality show about married life with Kevin Federline. However, the fact that she peddled her show on a third-rate network wasn't going to help get her career out of the slump its currently in. For all of Jessica Simpson's onscreen ""ditzyness"", she is a lot more marketing savvy than Britney could ever dream of being. Its a remarkable study in who those two ladies have developed their careers, and Jessica continues to surprise and amaze while Britney seems destined for trailer-park oblivion.

This second and third season is somewhat of a letdown from Season 1, when everything was fresh. Now its more of the same, but what surprises me most about seasons 2 and 3 was how little ""newlywed snuggling""/flirtation goes on. It almost looks as though Nick and Jessica are growing more tired of each other and maintain their distance from each other. With all the cameras, pappa-nazis, celebrity magazine articles predicting the demise of their marriage, and growing career pressures, it does appear in these two seasons that a strain is showing. For the sake of their marriage, I hope they know not to sign anymore commitments to live their lives in front of the camera. All is well and good for us voyeurs who are curious about the lives of the rich and beautiful, but I actually do care about the two of them and hope theirs is a marriage to last a lifetime in defiance of all the naysayers. I find Jessica Simpson to be an endearing, sweet, and funny young lady. In the episode where she keeps saying ""Gawww"" in place of ""God"", everyone else, including her hubby Nick tells her to ""shut up!"" because she's not saying it right. Well...am I the only one who finds that trait in her simply adorable? She can coo ""gawww!"" in my ear all day long. I think she's great and I'm looking forward to seeing her as Daisy Duke when ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" hits theaters in August. She makes the show worth watching, and Britney only wishes she had the marketing savvy that Jessica has. This one is the real deal...Britney and Kevin's show is a pale imitation that hopefully won't make it to DVD.",1119484800,8,2168,4.645833333333333
2260048,3,B0008KLV8M,"Whilst I still laugh out loud each time I watch this (she's dumb but in a cute funny way), I was a bit peeved that they claim it's seasons 2 and 3 yet from the way it's been shown on TV it's really only season 2.  Unless they aired both seasons back to back, this is incorect and you're only buying 1 season.  However, that being said, you should still get a kick from all the antics and it's always fun and enjoyable to watch Nick whose so cute and obviously a very patient guy.",1119484800,,479,4.031578947368421
2260049,5,B0008KLV8M,"Jessica Simpson.  My oh my, what two years can do in the fickle business that is the music industry!  In 2003 this B-list pop sensation knew that her 15 minutes of fame were on their way out the door, so she allowed MTV to follow her around with just married beau Nick Lachey in their Beverly Hills home.  Once released as ""Newlyweds: Nick & Jessica,"" her popularity shot to stratospheric fame, largely due to her ditzy sayings like her most famous, ""Is this chicken or fish?""  The show became a cultural phenom and the toothy blonde singer gained another 15 minutes in the spotlight.  Seasons 2 and 3 are as enjoyable as Season 1, and prove why this couple if at the top of America's favorites list.  ""Newlyweds: The Complete Seasons 2 & 3"" showcases life a year and half after married bliss, and includes LIVE footage from Jessica's Reality Tour 2004 as well as celebrity problems with becoming as famous as reigning teen queen Britney Spears.  Enjoyable show, enjoyable couple...just plain enjoyable.",1118880000,3,1003,4.763005780346821
