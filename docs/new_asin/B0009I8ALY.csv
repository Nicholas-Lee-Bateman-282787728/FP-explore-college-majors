2291394,5,B0009I8ALY,I consider myself pretty fit and love to workout outdoors and at home.  I've bought many different workout videos and this one is by far my favorite!  I bought the Debbie Siebers Slim-In-6 series about 6 years ago and still use it as well as her other DVD's regularly!  I recently bought this DVD for my sister who can't get enough of it!,1285372800,,338,4.333333333333333
2291395,5,B0009I8ALY,If you are not serious about exercing then this product is not for you. This work out is one of the best work out ever put out there and the name says all SHAPE IT UP!!.

2291396,5,B0009I8ALY,"I am a fan of Debbie Siebers Slim Series and she has yet again put together another great workout. This workout is around 75 minutes and offers a full body routine. It incorporates free weights for upper body, as well as with some lower body and incorporates ankle weights (optional) for added resistance when doing the lower body. The main downside is that there really isn't much in the way of cardio, per se, but you do get your heart rate up with the combination of moves and exercises that she offers. The cuing and transition from one grouping to the next is smooth. She encourages good form throughout the workout, breaks if needed, and is encouraging without being annoying. I like the option of turning the music off. The program is easy to follow and the moves are not complicated. I would say that this is not for beginners, but it is definitely something a person could work up to without any difficulty. She has 2 helpers that each offer a slightly different variation of the moves (what Debbie is doing and a slightly easy variation). I have yet to come across a workout that I don't like in the Slim Series.",1267142400,,1122,4.532019704433497
2291397,4,B0009I8ALY,I wanted just one of these tapes not the whole set like offered on TV so just what wanted also would have liked the start it up,1246060800,,127,3.740740740740741
2291398,5,B0009I8ALY,"I have several of Debbie Siebers workouts. She is great. I have lost a total of 40 pounds using her videos. She is wonderful for older women, or if you are really out of shape. A very good workout without all the jumping and hopping so many other ones require. I am a big fan.",1238544000,,276,4.036363636363636
2291399,3,B0009I8ALY,"This was my first Debbie Siebers workout and I'm dissappointed. The intensity and effectiveness is there, but it is boring, non-motivation, with bad music and sound quality. There is also no chaptering or any premixes, or mix and match options like other DVDs offer.
The workout style is a little like Jari Love, just less interesting and Debbie's personality is like Shelly McDonald's of Caribbean Workout. I like both Jari and Shelly and I can't say I dislike Debbie, it's just such a boring workout, I don't want to do again.",1213315200,,528,4.813186813186813
2291400,5,B0009I8ALY,"I am a long time exerciser, and have countless videos and DVD's.  I work out 3-4 times a week, and I now consider myself advanced. I have a hard time finding a challenge in most workouts.  However, this workout was surprisingly challenging.  The length of it, the repetition,  and the fact that you can vary your weights help.  Two days after completing this DVD, my thighs were so sore I was shocked!  I rarely experience soreness anymore, and certainly not to this extent!  And the amazing part is, after doing it perhaps 4 times in as many weeks, I am actually seeing a change in my body that I wasn't expecting!  I highly recommend this workout!",1193788800,,649,4.5344827586206895
2291411,4,B0009I8ALY,"This is a very good full-body strength workout which uses the ""high repetition, low weight"" style; for the majority of the workout, instructor Debbie Siebers uses only 5 lbs. weights, and she advises you to drop down to 3 lbs. if necessary.  The format of the routine is to work opposing muscle groups with weights while adding core work inbetween each weight segment.

The workout starts with a basic (somewhat boring) 5-minute warmup and then moves into the following segments (times are approximate):  lower body, 6 mins. (squats, dips, kicks); standing core 1, 2.5 mins. (side reaches, side bends); chest/shoulders, 3.5 mins.; standing core 2, 2 mins. (twists, punches); biceps/triceps, 4 mins.; standing core 3, 2 mins. (knee lifts, more twists and punches);  lower body, 10 mins. (standing and seated moves with optional ankle weights); floor chest/tricep work, 7 mins.; floor lower body, 10 mins. (crunches, thigh work); and standing shoulders/biceps/triceps with heavier weights (8 lbs.), 7 mins.  The workout then ends with a brief (4 mins.) stretch for a total time of 78 minutes.

This was my first-ever Slim Series workout, and I was a little daunted by the long length.  However, several factors made the workout feel manageable rather than overwhelming:  1) having the non-weighted core toning work interspersed with the weight work provided a bit of rest time and ensured that I never felt totally overworked, 2) moving to the floor about halfway through the program provided a bit of a ""break"" (even though the floor work was definitely tough!), and 3) the countdown timer which shows you how much time is left; at times, this could be a bit discouraging, but the timer was accompanied by a series of little dots which slowly disappeared as you completed each segment--this was definitely motivating!

Many people complain about the music in these workouts; I found it to be okay, if somewhat loud and a bit repetitive.  I had more of a problem with the sound quality, which seemed a bit echo-y.  Another thing I found a bit disappointing was that although there was plenty of standing core work (which I really liked), the floor abs work was not very intense.  After doing the workout yesterday, however, today I am pleasantly sore in my side waist area as well as just a bit in the abs themselves.  In fact, I like that this workout left me with a manageable soreness rather than the pain that I was anticipating.  Overall, I enjoyed this workout more than I thought I would, and despite the length, I am looking forward to doing it again soon.",1117584000,,2562,4.886836027713626
8061119,5,B0009I8ALY,The video was just what I expected and then some...I'm highly satisfied,1521849600,,71,5.0
8061120,4,B0009I8ALY,Ive been working out to Debbies videos for years. I would love to continue because the work out is amazing but Im searching for her DVDs with music. I was hoping to find some online but didn't find any!! Thats the only thing Im disappointed in.,1511136000,,244,4.326086956521739
8061121,1,B0009I8ALY,I love the instructor - but the sound quality is soooooo bad.,1481155200,,61,4.166666666666667
8061122,4,B0009I8ALY,I really enjoy working out with Debbie. I had gotten her slim in 6 series and it was good also. I would recommend any of her work out dvds.,1458691200,,139,3.8275862068965516
8061123,5,B0009I8ALY,"This is one of the best Beach Body workouts ever created. A lot of people have jumped on the PX90 and T25 bandwagons and those are great too, but I think this is a highly underrated workout series. The results are insane.",1454716800,,221,4.285714285714286
8061124,5,B0009I8ALY,thank you,1412035200,,9,4.0
8061125,5,B0009I8ALY,"This dvd is a great total body workout that will not kill you, but will work your body. I recommend this workout to stay in shape and feel good.",1375315200,,144,4.0
8061126,5,B0009I8ALY,"I am NOT overweight and did not want to get the Slim in 6 series as I do not want to lose a lot of weight.  I wanted a weight workout for the total body to work on my ""problem"" area, The dreaded muffin top. Although mine is a muffin tire!  LOL  This workout is great.  I love Debbie's style and I do not find the workout so difficult that I can not do it.  I have been doing this workout for 20 days now.  I do not always have time for the entire 78 minutes so I do what I can.  Most days only 40 minutes.  I measured my stomach last week for the first time and one week later I had lost a 1/4 inch!  That is great for me as I was having trouble losing the middle due to my age.  I highly recommend this workout.",1370908800,,712,3.7181208053691277
8061127,5,B0009I8ALY,"I received this DVD just a few days ago after purchasing it for a penny plus $2.50 shipping thinking that I could not lose as if I didn't like it no big loss as I paid so little for it. I had watched the infomercials on T.V but didn't want to pay that much and maybe end up not liking it so when I found an older version of it I decided to try it and I have to say I am very impressed by Debbie Siebers and her professionalism and preciseness that is lacking in some other exercise DVDs that I use. I surprised myself by being able to get thru the whole thing using 5-8lb weights! I have exercised regularly for about 30 years starting from my mid teens so have always been in good shape and have kept off the middle aged spread because of it. Very rarely anymore do I feel my muscles like I have with this workout and think maybe it is the extended time with lots of repetitions and the precision of the moves. Also she starts the workout on time and does not spend the first few minutes of the workout standing talking and instead talks and guides us and then precisely on time starts the work out so that you do workout for exactly 78 minutes. I started Monday and it is now Wednesday and I have just finished my second session and can tell you that I feel worked out and still feel sore from the Monday session especially in the triceps and upper thighs and chest area which usually I do not feel with my other workout programs. I have read reviews that complain about the music but I have no problem at all with it as we are not in a dance club but in a serious exercise session that does not need distracting music but something that makes time go by quicker and easier and has a good beat. I plan to work out to this DVD Monday, Wednesday and Friday for the next six weeks and then I will give another review as to my progress. I find Debbie to be beautiful to look at and very toned and slim without looking mannish and in fact I find her to be quite elegant and her presentation and manner is very pleasing and professional without going over the top. She suits me just fine but as people are different others may prefer oter personality types. I like to get down to business and thats what she does without being too dry or too silly.  Highly recommend this and I am very surprised at how much I am enjoying it!",1366156800,,2321,4.134955752212389
8061128,5,B0009I8ALY,"I purchased this dvd, thinking that since I worked out daily with Jillian, Bob, Tony, Jackie, Jeri and Shaun T.,this
would be a ""cake walk'! Was I ever wrong, I was So sore after this hour workout! I like Ms. Sieber's dvds so much,
I plan on ordering a few more. Amazon is so AWESOME, as is their sellers, I have gotten some great deals here! If you want to work up a good sweat/feel like you've really worked out, purchase some of these dvds! You'll like them!",1359158400,,461,4.25
