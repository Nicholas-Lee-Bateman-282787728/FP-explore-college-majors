5997823,5,B00FKVP018,"Wow, I am in awe. So many classic anime from the 70s and 80s are recently getting released. Shout! Factory released the Starzinger, Gaiking, and Danguard Ace movie trilogy compilations, and Eastern Star/Discotek has released Fist of the North Star, Galaxy Express 999, Captain Harlock, Space Adventure Cobra: The Movie (when can we get the complete series?) and now Cutie Honey. A no-brainer for any Go Nagai fan. Next up, Sentai Filmworks is releasing Tatsunoko Pro's original 1970s series Casshan. We can only hope that stuff like Mazinger Z, Getter Robo and Devilman are next on the list!

In the past, all we got was the American versions of AstroBoy, Kimba, Gigantor, Speed Racer, Voltron and Battle of the Planets (I am not even counting Star Blazers at $100 a season ... grr! ...), and ADV's release of the uncut Science Ninja Team Gatchaman (recently re-released by Sentai Filmworks who have been slowly re-releasing a lot of classic ADV stuff) so it is nice to see these things in the full uncut Japanese versions, even without English language dubs. Please support these releases so that we can get more of this classic material! Maybe, someday... we can see an uncut Japanese release of Jiro Kuwata's 8 Man... ?",1386374400,10,1222,4.875
8616508,5,B00FKVP018,"I saw a panel at otakon 2016 on anime from this period and was very upset to get home and learn that I was unable to get this show. I'd heard about the 90s ova but the snippets of the show I saw at the panel really ignited my interest in the show. When I got this DVD and started watching it, it was exactly what I was hoping it would be! It's a little more shonen than magical girl, and the animation may seem shoddy by today's standards, but the series is loads of fun and I really can say that my collection is much better for having this in it.
Kudos to Discotek for bringing more subtitled anime from this time period to us!",1501632000,2,629,4.0

8616510,5,B00FKVP018,"It's a nice collection and it's obvious the series was well cared for...  Compared to other shows from the 1970s, it's in immaculate shape.  The audio is clear enough (which is nice -- Japanese shows were STILL having audio issues well into the 1990s but it's pretty good here) and the film shows only mild grain.  Other shows I won't mention (cough Gatchaman cough cough) shows signs of film vinegaring and look way too dark or light in episodes.  I'm three-quarters through the series now and it looks VERY good for its age filmwise.  I'm playing my DVD set off a Blu ray scaled up 1080p for the TV set and it doesn't look bad.  I have other DVDs where the video quality isn't half as nice as it scaled up here and I'm playing it off probably the worst Blu ray player I have now!
Content-wise, this is vintage Cutie Honey, probably the closest anime adaptation of the original manga.  The 1990s OVA series is a direct-sequel to this series so you'll see characters that show up in the 1990s series in the original TV show.  The 2004 live-action film and OVA series are reimaginations of the main storyline in this 1973 TV series.
Another neat little tidbit: the lead voice actress, Cutey Honey herself, is the same voice actress who played the part of Fujiko Mine in the Lupin III series (TV, OVAs, TV specials, the movies including Castle of Cagliostro) for many, many years (close to 30 years).  So, the next time you watch any Lupin III anime made between 1977 and roughly 2010, chances are you're hearing the original Cutey Honey!  She has a very sensual voice which manages to fit this character very well considering she WAS in her 30s when the show's vocal tracks were recorded!
What can I say?  If you like the title character and her Marilyn Monroe-esque quality, the show will probably be entertaining to you weird as it is from the start.  it really isn't quite as sexual as some people might think...  There's far, far worse than this on Showtime or HBO!  The show was generally aimed at men but older teens (anybody over 17 for sure) will be able to handle it.  It's cartoon violence and the show is gleeful about this at some points but it doesn't stray into anything like ""Legend of the Overfiend"" level of overly graphic violence or adult situations.
I wish Cutey Honey was more popular in the States but we've been very, very lucky to get the original show, the 1990s OVAs, and the 2004 live-action film.
I'd definitely recommend this to people who enjoy retro-anime or want to see a series that isn't a harem show or part of the latest fad in current anime production.  (There are WAY too many musical/pop band anime and RPG/virtual reality-based shows, IMHO, and some of the classic anime series like Macross are being COMPLETELY SCREWED UP NOW!!!)  There are plenty of positives to be found in anime from the 1970s and 1980s if you can overlook some of the cost-cutting done in production.  The storylines and characterizations sure stick out more in a lot of the older shows.",1488758400,,2998,4.582397003745318
8616511,4,B00FKVP018,"Cutey Honey has starred in three different anime series (not to mention live action series) over more than twenty years, of which only the first two are available in English (the later OVA series is available either separately&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/New-Cutey-Honey-Collection-1/dp/B000050IL9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">New Cutey Honey: Collection 1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/New-Cutey-Honey-Collection-2/dp/B0000542DB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">New Cutey Honey: Collection 2</a>&nbsp;or together&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/New-Cutey-Honey-Collection-1-2/dp/B003ZKC2JY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">New Cutey Honey: Collection 1 & 2</a>).  Given the host of problems the production ran into it is astonishing that this first series was ever made, but the frantic attempts at rewriting it to fit the differing audience and time slot assigned made it what it became: the very first magical girl series... for boys.

Honey Kisaragi is a mischievous 16-year-old student at an all girls Catholic school who discovers to her shock at the murder of her father by the criminal group Panther Claw that she is in fact an android who possesses inside her, her father's invention for turning air into matter.  Desired for creating gold and jewels out of thin air, it is sought by her father's murderers, who initially don't know where it is or what she is, but Honey vows to use it instead for vengeance against them.  With the help (and I use that term loosely) of the Hayami family: father, older son, younger son, and eventually nephew, lust crazed idiots all, she battles against the Panther Claw weirdo woman representative of the week.

I was astonished by the beauty of the nearly 45-year-old animation, (clearly this has been restored at sometime by somebody!), it almost looks like Blu-ray!  However, the weird combo of wacky humor and deadly menace took some getting used to.  There is also a repetitious sameness to the episodes, most of which follow the exact same pattern.

Last of all we come to Cutey Honey's gimmick: whenever she changes costume by using her father's inborn invention she is briefly, temporarily, utterly and completely nude.  How does this hold up?  Well, I think it is safe to say that almost half a century later, they'd still have to censor it to get it on American TV.  True, it might not be as large and clear and slow moving as modern Japanese animation, but one can certainly see the reason for its fame.

Note: This series represents another triumph due to the efforts of Discotek Media who are also responsible for the release of the old TOEI classics&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horus-Prince-of-The-Sun-Little-Norse-Prince/dp/B00PEA6K0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horus, Prince of The Sun (Little Norse Prince)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wonderful-World-of-Puss-N-Boots/dp/B000F48DAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wonderful World of Puss 'N Boots</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Animal-Treasure-Island/dp/B000BLI5Q4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Animal Treasure Island</a>.

8616514,5,B00FKVP018,"We must live in a pretty cool era to have the original 1970's Cutie Honey TV series available in America. I simply though that this was something that would never ever occur. If you're a fan of anime, especially Mahou Shojo ( Magical Girl Genre), you cannot ignore Cutie Honey as a trailblazer.  Cutie Honey is a very good look at the early history of the 'transforming' super hero. The entire genre owes, in a way, it's entire existence on the ideas Cutie Honey embodies, Although Cutie Honey is in fact a Shonen (Boys Genre) of Anime.

The DVD set is compact, neat, and pretty simple. All in Japanese with English subs that can be turned off. The audio and Picture are excellent, obviously having been beautifully restored at some point.  Beautiful , crisp picture, natural grain, psychedelic colors, funky 70's fashion. Goofy humor. Cutie Honey is great. All we need is the  Cutie Honey Flash and Re:  series, and we'll have a party!",1448841600,6,936,4.682926829268292

8616517,5,B00FKVP018,"I loved the OAV in the 90's, but always felt there was something missing, and of course there was, all the things that happened to Honey 20 years ago.  Now, finally I am about to watch it all, to know what happened when Honey was a teenager, just how she defeated Panther Claw.

The story is that Honey's father is killed by the evil terrorist organization Panther Claw.  They want this device he invented that allows any matter to be reconfigured to any other matter.  But, alas they don't find it.  So, they go after his daughter to tell them where it is, not ever realizing that she is in fact an android and the device is inside of her.  She uses it against them to disguise herself and fight them off in each episode.",1410566400,,722,4.311111111111111
