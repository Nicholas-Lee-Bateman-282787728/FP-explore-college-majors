8298353,3,B001EIOOW2,"The 3 stars are for THIS PRODUCT AS IT IS PACKAGED and is NOT a rating of the movies themselves or a rating on the quality of the video and audio of the disks.  While all 3 of these films are fantastic (I was completely blown away by American Gangster and Eastern Promises), do yourself a favor, save 16 bucks and buy the Blu-Ray versions of these separately.",1279065600,14,359,4.279411764705882
8298354,5,B001EIOOW2,"I strongly recommend all of these films, Casino of course being one of the greatest films ever, and the other two definitely worth owning.  The transfer on Eastern Promises is fantastic!",1252713600,6,186,5.0
