The actors portray their characters superbly. They all deserve Oscars for their performances, especially so for the ""Angry family"" episode. Can't wait to get this DVD.",1086307200,5,363,4.6875
2047362,5,B0001ZMWXW,Great show and should be a great set.  What took so long?  Friends already has at least 7 seasons out.  Strange.  Glad to pre order this one for sure!!  Check out Sledge Hammer!  First season coming out around the same time.  Great show often overlooked from the 80's.,1084147200,5,268,4.458333333333333
2047363,5,B0001ZMWXW,"Nowadays you just don't see many shows on TV that are worth watching. Everybody loves Raymond is a show that portrays what seems to be a realistic family and they deal with realistic everyday life problems. Such include problems with the parents- in-law, in marriage, in raising children, etc. This show has helped me look at society with a more critical eye also. I am currently a student at the University of California at Berkeley majoring in Sociology and Social Welfare and I find so many themes that we've spoken about in my classes here. The complexity of the characters and of the problems they face provide the viewer with a funny, yet educational, portrayal of family life.",1082678400,20,683,4.796610169491525
2047364,5,B0001ZMWXW,"Everybody loves Raymond is the most wanted DVD I have been waiting for these years..The Italian-American Family sitcom resembles my family in Taiwan ...I spend lots nights waiting their funky family stories while I was in New York ... it reminds me of the family ties , tension , intimacy ,ethics , parenthood and love ...Most important of all ..the expression of the outstanding casts may be a bit of exaggerated however various awards show how lovely the sitcom is one of the favorite among audience internationally. I specially love the episodes when Barone family has been invited to Italy meeting their remote relatives....It's like "" Life is Wonderful "" bring my heart from Long Island to  Rome for a tasty Gelato ...I am so glad that the sitcom  DVD finally come out and hope to see other seasons soon!",1082505600,9,809,4.771428571428571

The characters are richly defined, and the actors portraying them do an excellent job every time. This particular episode, where Debra is supposed to be interview by a radio psychiatrist is a classic of the kind of comedy this show does. Everyone can relate to it. And everyone can watch it. That is important. The only thing I wish Amazon would do is to make these episodes free, for the Prime members.",1478217600,6,492,4.666666666666667

I find I don't have much love for Ray. He comes off as a big jerk a lot of the time. He manipulates his wife in nearly every episode. The way he, a married man, reacts to women other than his wife can be a little irritating and his whining can be very annoying. All in all a lot of the episodes are pretty funny. It's just after all this time I realize my least favorite character on the show is actually Raymond.",1460592000,,576,3.889830508474576

Occasionally you might get one that's more appropriate for adults only but even then you don't get the vulgarity and lewdness you find in today's comedies.  Yes, they are a dysfunctional family but that's where the humor comes in and they always seem to have each other's backs. Glad I bought it.",1455667200,,371,4.537313432835821

There were a few inappropriate things BUT I liked it. Best of all I got to enjoy watching with my daughter. This is a set that we can watch when we just want to lock ourselves in the house and hide under the blankets. I love the cast.",1446163200,2,372,3.6625
2047558,5,B0001ZMWXW,"First I watched them for the laughs. Then I started watching the repeats for  the truth behind the jokes. Who hasn't seen some of Marie or Frank or Deborah or Raymond in themselves? I don't mention Robert because he's a caricature put in the series for  exaggeration and laughs and he mugs too much.

Now I'm totally addicted and hope the series will run forever or like The Middle continue with the Barone family maturing.

My favorite episodes, by the way, are the ones where the family goes to Italy and where Frank and Marie are kicked out of the adult community they sign up for.",1445472000,,584,4.481132075471698

2047992,3,B0001ZMWXW,My parents love this series! Problem----each 30 minute episode has to be started manually. No continuous play. I have to run in and start each one every 30 minutes. Very inconvenient. Overall the ordering and delivery experience was great.,1401926400,,239,5.153846153846154
2047993,3,B0001ZMWXW,"While I have always loved Everybody loves Raymond, I only got to watch about half of the episodes, because some of them would not stream. After a couple of minutes trying to get one to start, I would give up and go to the next episode, which would run fine. That is the only program so far that I have had trouble with.",1401926400,,319,4.079365079365079
2047994,5,B0001ZMWXW,I highly recommend this series. Even though it is more than several years old the humor is still top notch. When you are feeling let down because there is nothing to watch on TV this series will pick you up.,1401235200,,207,4.2
2047995,4,B0001ZMWXW,"I like the interplay between the different relatives.  It is easy to identify with the situations.  It is hilarious the way the mother-in-law will make a statement that outwardly seems okay at first, but then there is a wicked intention under it.",1401148800,,246,4.833333333333333

2048041,1,B0001ZMWXW,i DID NOT WATCH THIS SHOW SOMEONE ELSE IN THE HOUSE DID. DO NOT REALLY CARE FOR THE PROGRAM WHEN IT WAS AIRING ON CBS ON IT'S FIRST RUN.,1400544000,,136,3.7241379310344827
2048042,5,B0001ZMWXW,"I did not watch this when it was first on tv. I've been watching it now on Amazon Prime Instant Video.  I was very surprised at how good it was. The reason for its success is that it is not about just the nuclear family. It puts a very comic spin on the nuclear family by putting his utterly crazy family of father, brother, and mother, right across the street from this family. So they can never get away from the in-laws and they are up to one crazy thing after another. Patricia Heaton as Ray's wife Debra is the voice of sanity (the straight woman) in this show whereas Ray and his family are the comics.  They are utterly zany. The brother cop is especially good and the late Peter Boyle as Ray's father is simply outstanding. Ray Romano is an excellent comic and he delivers his comic lines perfectly episode after episode.  This was a huge hit when it was on the air and I can see why.

2048043,5,B0001ZMWXW,Watching this again and brings me back to 10 years ago but now I love it even more as I can feel the same stress as a family of four and appreciate to see how Raymond and Debra turned the stress to humor.,1399680000,,204,3.7674418604651163
2048044,4,B0001ZMWXW,"This is one of my favorite classic series!

2048047,5,B0001ZMWXW,"I had only seen a handful of episodes on network tv, a couple of them more than once though I never watched the entire show I didn't really care for what I saw. Lots of people I knew watched all the time when it came on tvland. When I saw it on amazon prime I thot I'd try it out because I like seeing how shows evolve from the beginning. I was hooked by the 4th episode and episode 21 was so funny I almost peed my pants I watched 3x in a row. Must see!",1398729600,,454,3.7395833333333335
2048048,5,B0001ZMWXW,Excellent acting.  Very funny.  Actual events from life are used - highly exaggerated.  Great comedy series.  The situations which occur are common to most families at some times.,1398643200,,179,5.285714285714286
2048049,5,B0001ZMWXW,"My mom kept trying to get me to watch Everybody Loves Raymond. She'd save recorded shows for me to see and I never watched them, assuming the series wouldn't appeal to me. I'm not a fan of sitcoms, especially those that focus on home life. Now that I'm streaming video rather than subscribing to cable TV, I decided to give it a try -- fully expecting to delete the season after seeing just a few minutes. How wrong i was! I was hooked right away. The characters are all perfect for their roles and the writing is smart and funny, with humor wrung from situations most people can identify with. There's a lot of truth behind the laughs. I now have all the seasons on my watch list.",1398470400,,681,4.328125

with stereotypical but unlikely characters.",1398211200,,145,5.3478260869565215

2048093,5,B0001ZMWXW,"Everybody Loves Raymond, to me, is timeless.  I enjoyed this series during the years it entertained us and the characters and themes are still relevant.  As I watched the re-runs I still think of people I know who are similar in real life to the characters.  Their comedic life problems can still bring more than smiles and sometimes an outrageous belly laugh.  I watch this series on my Roku via Amazon Prime.  Another reason I enjoy my Prime membership.",1397520000,,455,4.708860759493671
2048094,5,B0001ZMWXW,I like to watch an episode or 2 of ELR before going to bed.  Helps me unwind and forget the issues of the day.,1397433600,,110,3.5833333333333335

2048096,5,B0001ZMWXW,"This show is truly imaginative, and I love the characters.

I'd not seen this show until TV Land showed it. When I changed cable companies, I no longer got TV Land, so discovering it on Amazon has been a really nice experience. Now I can watch for free with my PRIME membership, without having to pay the cable company for the channel it's on.

Love that Amazon PRIME!",1397088000,,368,4.397058823529412

2048142,5,B0001ZMWXW,"I remembered watching this back in my college days and I didn't find any of the jokes funny or can correspond to Raymond and his family. However, after 10 years and I'm finally married and have my own two kids, I decided to give this show another try to kill time, and wow, I was shock on how funny it is now. I guess you have to experience it yourself to really understand the meaning behinds Raymond's jokes. My wife now enjoys it too because she finds it funny and can always correspond our family activities to the show. Overall, a must watch for married couples.",1395360000,,567,4.3584905660377355

Of course trying to get them to fix this is impossible and they keep blaming my internet connection.  I have a 50 Mbps download speed. On BOTH of my TV's, streamed to my PC, streamed to my Kindle fire HD and downloaded at best quality to my Kindle Fire HDX the same horrible compression and lousy picture are displayed, and stuttering or uneven frame rates in some episodes.",1391212800,2,505,4.478260869565218

2048260,5,B0001ZMWXW,I still love watching all the reruns because it has a lot of family comedy that a lot of us can relate to. There isn't enough television like this anymore. It still has it's serious moments but not drama serious.

Having seen a lot of the later seasons while it was still running, it's kind of fun to go back and see how it started and how the characters were a little different back then.",1389657600,,285,3.982456140350877

2048310,4,B0001ZMWXW,"I like Ray Romano's dry humor and I enjoy his character in the show. Deborah (Ray's wife) always seems surprised and upset by it however. Who did she think she was marrying? Was it a case of ""I will marry him now and change him later?"" From a man's perspective this particular behavior gets old VERY fast. Ray's parents and his brother are totally off the wall and the perfect foil for Deborah.

Is hard to explain my liking this show, but I do like it. Maybe it is the mix of personalities? Like mixing oil and water. No matter how hard you try, it never works. You just end up with a mess. With this TV show ""the mess"" is often quite funny.",1388707200,,642,4.17741935483871

2048315,5,B0001ZMWXW,"Styles have changed since this show aired, and in that sense, it's dated. But the stories are still good stories. The characters are wonderful and the humor itself is great. One of the things that I enjoy about this show is that it really gets me laughing. Every family has its quirks, this one more than most, but the quirks are not that far away from some of what I find in my own family. I can relate to it and yet be grateful that I don't have things quite as bad as these delightful and yet kooky people. It's a fun, good-hearted show to watch. My daughter (16) watches with me much of the time and laughs as much as I do.",1388361600,,627,4.105691056910569

2048411,5,B0001ZMWXW,"I always thought the first seasons of Everyone Loves Raymond were some of the best.  As the show moved on to later seasons, I thought the humor was not as funny or entertaining and really disliked the ""meaness"" of comments between the spouses.  But in the beginning episodes, there was a sweetness.  My favorite episode has always been, ""Frank, the Writer"".  The scene where Marie is trying to change the typewriter ribbon is hilarious. Of course, the humor may be lost on anyone who has never had to change a typewriter ribbon like the one Marie was using.  I also loved how Frank calls the Reader's Digest, ""The Digest"" and Raymond offers him $1,000 to stop calling it that. At the end of the episode there is a very poignant, heartfelt moment between Raymond and his dad.  Many of these old sitcoms were very funny and can be watched over and over.  If you are in need of a good laugh, I recommend any of the episodes from Season I.  Even the show opening is pretty funny, as the cast rides on a conveyor belt behind Raymond in his front lawn while he introduces them!  Enjoy!",1378771200,,1079,4.464285714285714

Plus how it impacts all their lives it is great.  He can be cajoled into just about anything, has a conscious, tries but never seems to quite get there, wherever there is.

I found none of that. The pilot episode was good. The second episode was stunning and evocative. (I choked up, which led to the philosophical question: If a man gets emotional, but there's no woman there to see it, did it really happen?)  The 3rd episode was excellent, robust. And on and on...

They have mother-in-law issues. The husband will do a dumb mistake and the wife will call him an ""idiot"" everytime when he starts to walk away. There are not too many or any clean family shows anymore on television. This is a great way to watch clean family shows without having to worry what they are going to say.

Because I detest loud (or any) laugh tracks with sitcoms, I opted to avoid watching it. I also avoided the reruns on miscellaneous channels. Now, however, I'm an Amazon Prime member and I can watch the series at my leisure. I still don't like the laugh tracks, but I can watch a solo episode or, if my head isn't throbbing, I'll enjoy the humor in several of Raymond's escapades or mishaps.

Not with this set; whoever designed it was a moron.  You have to select each episode individually after the previous one finishes and the 3rd one didn't even have sound with it; it made no sense.  Quite frankly, the dvd set is designed as frustrating as the lead character in the show.",1364169600,,507,4.372340425531915

2048707,4,B0001ZMWXW,"I think this show is very funny, but some aspects of it make it less desirable. First of all, it teaches that men are idiots who seek after women for sex, but that women rightfully withhold it from their less-good-than-they-are husbands; this theme can be offensive to people who have relationship struggles, as I have had. Second, as a result of this theme, sex is frequently mentioned which makes it unsuitable for certain groups especially children.",1363737600,,452,4.9605263157894735

2048730,4,B0001ZMWXW,"I find that most shows are trying to find ""their voice"" (or establish their identity) in the first season (sometimes even the first couple of seasons) but what I found when we went back and re-watched season 1 of Raymond is that they hit it on the head from the start.  Funny. Enjoyable.  I was surprised how well it held up in light of all that was to come.  Definitely worth watching for anyone who either wants to know what it was about or who want to go back and watch from the beginning.",1363737600,,492,4.212765957446808

A lot of people brush over this show thinking its a kiddy show or wholesome Full House show. Its not. Its about a family that is way too close. Everyone that we have loan our dvd's to or have seen it, love it. Marie is a great character. A real mother who loves one son and not so crazy about the other one who wants her love the most. Peter Boyle, who played the monster in Young Frankenstein is the father. Brad Garrett the 6'8 brother does a great job as the jealous brother. This show is pretty much for all adults and not too bad for kids though they do talk about some real like things. The family is Italian and Catholic. Doesn't have too much to do with the show but Ray doesn't like church because he feels he's a good guy. Debra tells him, ""Well how about we all come over here and sit around you on sunday.""

2048832,5,B0001ZMWXW,"My father introduced me to this show. He watched it because of the few American shows shown overseas. My original reason for not watching the show was the title. Once I sat down and watched the show I enjoyed it. I ordered the complete series and don't regret it. I enjoy the show so much I record it because I know I will get a laugh late at night.

The show is said to be based on Raymond, but what I have found is tha it is based not only on Raymond but those who write the show. One of the best things about the show is that the children are in the background, very few shows are totally based around the children. There is not one of the shows I don't like.

This is a show that has characters that will make you think, that reminds me of someone in my family. This is also a show that has a good final show. Not as good as the Newhart show, but makes you think the series is not ending.

2048895,5,B0001ZMWXW,"This show was probably a sleeper hit in a time of Friends and it's many copied sitcoms. This show is a family based sitcom with a stellar cast like New York Long Island comedian Ray Romano who finally got out of doing the standup routines that we knew him for finally got his own show like Drew Carey. The First season is still stellar when it comes to casting like PAtricia Heaton as the long-suffering wife and mother who stays home to take care of the kids. Ray's parents are perfectly casted with Emmy winners Peter Boyle and DOris Roberts as the veteran couple. Who doesn't love Frank and Marie? They live across the street from her son, his wife and grandchildren. THeir older son, Robert, lives with them also. He is played by another standup comedian, Brad Garrett. The show doesn't revolve around the children as much as it revolved around the interactions between Ray and Debra, Frank and Marie, Robert and Raymond, etc. Their plots are never stupid or out of this world or crazy like some shows. They all learn learn something from each other especially about tolerating each other's annoying habits like Marie comes over and criticizes Debra's household from cleaning to cooking, etc. According to Marie, Debra is sloppy and a terrible cook but she's not. Marie is acting like a typical mother-in-law and grandmother. Her husband, Frank, likes to sit with his zippers unzipped watching games. RObert is a police officer who always has an unhappy look on his face because his brother Raymond gets all the love including mom and dad. Ray is a sports writer who travels mostly in the first season. I love the episode in the first season where Debra's parents come from Connecticut and they are played by Robert Culp and Katherine Helmond to take the whole family out to a fancy French restaurant. Frank and Marie act like they have never been to somewhere there are too many silverware and glassware on the table and worrying about the cost. Ray remarks ""your parents and my parents don't belong in the same state."" After all, Debra's parents are cultured, world travellers who are planning a trip to Vietnam. Frank and Marie are just lucky enough to leave Long Island. They're just satisfied as they are but the two parents are worlds apart as we learn and Debra's upbringing included trips to museums and shows.",1186963200,3,2322,4.735802469135803

2048897,4,B0001ZMWXW,"Everybody Loves Raymond - The Complete First Season is a great introduction to an excellent ensemble comedy.  This is not the best season of this series, but it is a 4 star experience none the less.  This series, like many other of the great sitcoms, begins slowly and starts to build momentum.  By the end of season one, the great ensemble cast really starts to gell and turn into something special.  The one opportunity that was missed the first season was capitalizing on the excellent character of Robert Barone played by the very funny Brad Garrett.

This is an above average season in what would become an excellent show.

Four stars for the better episodes and taste of things to come.",1183852800,,692,4.677685950413223
2048898,2,B0001ZMWXW,"I don't understand the major appeal of this show.  Do you think this style of comedy was meant to hang around for nine years?  Surely that's too long.  Maybe one or two seasons.

Raymond's character comes across as just a regular family man.  Everyone points to him as being the star of the show, and a genius for comedy.  Since when?  Sometimes he might say a couple decent things.  I certainly don't consider him some kind of cozy, lovable guy like apparently most people do.

It's probably not Raymond himself that's the biggest problem with the show.  It's the way the storylines always flow *so* slowly, and they never pick up at all for the course of an entire episode.  Every episode does the same thing.  You really have to force yourself to pay attention to the lines each of the characters are saying, because the show drags on and on.  It feels like a comedy for old people.

Why am I picking on Season One, you ask?  This is where it all began, and it's also the worst season because everything is so quiet, and the beginning stages were just that- the beginning of a long, successful series.  Did the show improve as the years went on?  Yeah, but slowly, and it never reached a point where I'd jump up and scream ""genius"" or anything.

I guess this is the style of comedy Americans like the most.  It boggles my mind how that's possible, but whatever.

With that said, the guy who plays the father IS funny.  He's the only reason I watch it.",1181260800,2,1454,4.411320754716981
2048899,5,B0001ZMWXW,"When EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND got started, back in 1996, it started out at a slow and unassuming pace, introducing us to the delightfully off-the-wall shenanigans of the Barone family.  Ray Barone (Ray Romano) is a sports writer with two beautiful twin boys and a daughter (all played by the Sweetin children, younger siblings of Jodi Sweetin of FULL HOUSE fame), as well as a long suffering wife, Debra (Patricia Heaton), his older brother, Robert (Brad Garrett) and his parents, Marie (Doris Roberts) and Frank (Peter Boyle of YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN fame).

What sets this show apart from other programs is its matter-of-fact approach to the trials and tribulations of a very close knit family (sometimes, painfully close knit!).  These early episodes really set the pace for future episodes that only grew more and more hilarious.  The formative shows introduced us to the neurotic Robert, who went through a painful divorce and moved back in with his parents.  His mother, Marie, is overbearing, perfectionist and narcissistic, yet, she also genuinely wants what's best for her kids.  Granted, Ray and Robert are both in their mid thirties.  Frank, on the other hand, is unabashedly blunt, harsh and apathetic to human suffering (with the exception of the time he spent in Korea during the war).  Ray is an overgrown man-child wh married the more sophisticated Debra, and there are times when both of them wonder how they even ended up together!  Yet, at the end of the day, they sincerelly love each other.  This is a great program and I definitely reccomend this DVD, as a fine way to get started on your RAYMOND addiction.",1180656000,7,1624,4.959409594095941

2048955,1,B0001ZMWXW,"This show is hack-kneed tripe.  Alleged comedian Ray Ramono is obnoxious as the whiny, juvenile, low-brow Ray Barone, a ""sports writer"", who just can't fill his need to be dominated.  He tried with an overbearing, ""holier than thou,"" know-it-all wife Debra, but that wasn't enough, so he lives right across the street from his equally obnoxious, overbearing parents and his 2-dimensional, Eeyore-like brother Robert.

Did Ray and Debra meet and then get married 5 minutes later?  In every single episode, there is some sort of terrible deception between them that would end any real-life marriage -- especially in today's society.  Again, in every single episode they're always learning new things about eachother: ""I never knew (this or that),"" or ""How come you never (this or that)?""  Did Ray first meet his parents and brother 5 minutes before the start of the series?  Again, in every episode Ray is taken aback as he learns something new about his parents, or something about his upbringing.

Through the entire run of this series, there is absolutely NO character development, besides the obligatory ""marriage episode"" of Robert and his girlfriend.  As for the kids (who are routinely shown to be ""adored"" by Ray, after routine neglect of them) i think if they could have found a way to not age them, they would have -- the children are mentioned almost in passing.

Unfortunately, if you're looking to buy a season set you're probably a fan of the show, or have at least seen it.  If i can stop one person from buying this cartoonish, sophomoric load of garbage that couldn't even accidentally be mistaken for real life, then this wasn't in vain.  If you enjoy obnoxious, stereotypical morons then ""Everybody Loves Ray"" is right up your alley.  If you want intelligence, wit and parody, try ""The Simpsons"".",1167782400,8,1813,4.9438943894389435

The plot centers upon Ray Barone, a sportswriter living on Long Island with his wife Debra and children Ally, Geoffrey and Michael. The bane of their existence is Ray's parents Marie and Frank...living just across the street, and acting like Ray and Debra's home is an extension of their own. To compound the problem, Ray's older brother Robert, a divorced NYPD lieutenant, moves back home...

This show doesn't look for sophisticated, implausible storylines. Rather, it focuses upon the tiny aspects of everyday life and relationships - father/son, husband/wife, brother/brother, parent/child - and finds comedy in the truth. Ray and Debra often clash, as he just wants to relax when he comes home from work, and she - a stay-at-home mom - wants him to pitch in, or go out. Frank is crass, and Marie is nosy and opinionated.

2048958,4,B0001ZMWXW,"I am pretty sure that while some of you have been tuning into ""Raymond"" from the very beginning, there are many, many other loyal fans who didn't start getting into the show until it really took off around Season 4. In any case, this season is a very fun one to revisit and will undoubtedly take you back to the cast's much earlier days.

Seasons 1 and 2 focused mostly on Ray, Debra and their very young family. 5-year-old Madylin Sweeten and her real-life brothers, 1-year-old twins Sullivan and Sawyer Sweeten, were sweet and fun to watch as such little kids. The characters, in general, were not nearly as developed as they became, which is all too natural, but the storylines were fresh and genuinely funny.

It's not my favorite season, just because the characters were brand new and didn't have much to them quite yet (Ray and Debra barely even argued), but I enjoy watching the episodes to see how far everyone has come in these past 9 years. As always, it's nearly impossible not to pinpoint at least one of these characters who reminds you of someone you know from your own life, which is why it's so hilarious to watch.

2048960,5,B0001ZMWXW,"Everybody Loves Raymond is quite possibly the greatest sitcom of all time. (It is WAY funnier that Seinfeld, which was more clever than funny, but apparently people confuse the two.) There is a real innocence to the first season that gradually eroded as the show progressed. It's as if the writers made a conscious decision to sacrifice the ""clean family sitcom"" image for ""edgy family sitcom"", without going so far as to sacrifice what made the show so enduring. When watching the first season in retrospect it's almost weird how well Ray and Debra get along here. Debra practically never yells at Ray and there's a cheesy ""conflict resolution"" scene between them at the end of almost every episode. Some people liked this side of their relationship when compared to other seasons and started to hate the show when it started to move away from this device. I don't care for it. I'd much rather have Debra yelling at Ray or vice versa every episode, it's funnier that way. Their constant arguing started getting annoying in the sixth season, but thankfully the writers got things back on track for the final three seasons.

Season one has many typical sitcom plots and some are pulled of better than others. Only the episode ""Standard Deviation"" seems like it would be at home in later seasons. The actors were still trying to find their way as well. Brad Garret doesn't alter his baritone delivery until late in the season and Romano speaks in a bored, monotone voice.

The pilot episode does a nice job of introducing the characters and setting up the premise as well as some running gags. Fans should get this season set just to see how radically different it is from the others and how far it came. The fact that this show's potential was turned into greatness is a testament to its writers and actors.",1141516800,5,1806,4.712025316455696

PILOT: 7/10: A great start to the show, I especially like the ""Fruit Of The Month"" joke.

I LOVE YOU: 8/10: A Great one. I especially like it when Frank goes ""What are you, In freakin' fairyland?"" after Ray asks him how he should say ""I Love you"".

I WISH I WERE GUS: 5/10: An okay episode, the only part I like is when Ray preforms the eulogy at Gus's funeral.

STANDARD DEVIATION: 10/10: I love this one. Robert makes Ray and Debra take an IQ test, and Deb scores higher. Then, Rob tells R+D that he might of made a mistake and Ray had the higher one.

LOOK, DON'T TOUCH: 10/10: This one is hot. Ray feels guilty for becoming attracted to the new waitress at Nemo's. And trust me, The waitress has nice booty. Seriously.

FRANK THE WRITER: 9/10: A funny episode, where Frank gets a column in Reader's Digest. The ""Roy"" joke is funny.

YOUR PLACE OR MINE?: 3.5/10 Not really a good one, and it's kind of disturbing to see Marie babying Ray and Rob.

IN-LAWS: 11/10: Mabye the best one? I think so. Debra's parents visit, and this affects Ray's parents, then one time, wehn they all go out for supper at this fancy resturant, They act rude (I.E. ""Why is there so much silverware on the table? Yea how many mouths do you think I have?"")

WIN LOSE OR DRAW: 8/10: Ray loses $23,000 to frank during a poker game. This one was good.

TURKEY OR FISH: 6/10: Really good. Debra wants to have fish for thanksgiving.

CAPTAIN NEMO: 2/10: Enough said.

THE BALL: 9/10: Classic. Ray is shocked when he finds out that his Mickey Mantle signed ball is a fake. Meanwhile, The daugter Alley wants to know wether Santa claus is real.

DEBRA'S SICK: 10/10: Debra has the flu and Ray has to stay home with her, but he has to interview Terry Bradshaw.

WHO'S HANDSOME?: 5/10: Meh.

THE CAR: 1.4/10: Do I even have to talk about this crapfest?

DIAMONDS: 7/10: I loved it. Ray learns that his engagement ring to Debra is a fake. Quite a simple.

THE GAME: 4/10: meh.

RECOVERING PESSIMEST: 7/10: Great. Rob is jealous of Ray's sucess when he wins the ""Writer of the year"" award.

THE DOG: 10/10: Ray brings a bulldog home. Later on, the owner shows up and claims it. but then pissed off at what they did with it, she gives it back.

NEIGHBORS: 9/10: I love this one. The neighbors are pissed off at F+R's behavior.

FASCINATIN' DEBRA: 8/10: classic. Debra is tought of as ""boring"" by a phone shrink. Later on, The family shows up to convince her that she's not boring.

WHY ARE WE HERE?: 10/10: I love it! The finale. a flashback to what happened before this madness began.

So a worthwell season. go buy it!",1123804800,4,2796,4.334615384615384

2049023,5,B0001ZMWXW,"First telecast in the Fall of 1996, Everybody Loves Raymond became an instant favorite among TV audiences, a love affair that would last for nine memorable seasons. Following on the heels of a series of successful sitcoms starring stand-up comics - Seinfeld, Home Improvement, The Drew Carey Show, etc., Everybody Loves Raymond drew upon the comedic talents of Ray Romano who plays the role of the title character Ray Barone...

A successful Long Island-based sportswriter, Ray and his wife Debra (Patricia Heaton) enjoy a happy marriage and the company of their three children - daughter Ally (Madylin Sweeten) and twin sons Geoffrey (Sawyer Sweeten) and Michael (Sullivan Sweeten). But they also happen to live directly across the street from Ray's parents, Frank (Peter Boyle) and Marie (Doris Roberts), who take it upon themselves to enter their son and daughter-in-law's house whenever they wish (without knocking) and dispense advice and sometimes insults. Joining Frank and Marie is Ray's brother Robert (Brad Garrett), a divorced policeman, who periodically lives with Frank and Marie and is often jealous of Ray's idyllic life. Together, they create the perfect loving and dysfunctional family...

The Everybody Loves Raymond (Season 1) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere in which Debra and Ray, sick of Ray's parents and brother showing up uninvited, conspire to keep their nosy relatives out of the house... Other notable episodes include ""Frank, The Writer"" in which Ray's father attempts to become a newspaper columnist like his son, and ""Turkey or Fish"" in which Debra and Marie engage in an unofficial competition to see who can cook the best Thanksgiving dinner... The Season 1 DVD also includes guest appearances by sports icons Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Terry Bradshaw, Barry Bonds, Katarina Witt, Tommy Lasorda, Marv Albert, Kristi Yamaguchi, and Desmond Howard...

Here in the UK, unlike brilliant shows we import from the US like; Seinfeld, Larry Sanders, Will and Grace, Frasier, Sex and the City....this comedy is really average.

Maybe its Ray Romano, who gets paid a ridiculous sum each episode. Face it he's not funny! His delivery is like Droopy on downers, yes that dull. Even here someone said in a review that the other characters were funnier.

This comedy is one step from the Cosby Show, and that is not a complement, trust me. The gags are lined up with big red flags before they arrive for the audience to laugh at. Very 1970s.

2049030,5,B0001ZMWXW,"This is one of the best family-oriented sitcom this decade.  ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" put a new twist on the family sitcom.  Most good ""family"" sitcom we know, such as Fullhouse, Growing Pains, and the Cosby Show, deals mostly with parents-children situation and tension.  ELR is different as it really focuses on the tension between a middle-aged man and his meddlesome parents.  Raymond's young children have relatively little cameo, though some episodes deal with them (e.g., Pet Cemetary, Micheal's Basketball).

I think this TV show is great, simply because we all have similar situations that we can relate to.  And the older we get (middle-aged), the more likely these situation occurs.  For example, parents who come over all the time, or your mom who doesn't think your wife is ""good"" enough.  ELR takes those cases and put it in a comedic light.  The typical spousal tension is there as well, and the best episode for that is ""the Can Opener,"" shown in a later season.  There are other episodes where Debra (Ray's wife) and Ray get into each other nerve, but there are too many to count.

For this first season, my favorite episodes are ""Standard Deviation"" and ""Who's Handsome.""  The first pilot episode is definitely different, and you can tell that the actors and actresses are still a little rusty and starting to get used to working among each other.  If you follow the first episode onward, you'll realized that certain things carried over to the next year and the next.  The ""fruit-of-the-month"" first brought up in the 1st episode has carried on to the 9th season!

My girlfriend thinks that Friends is the best sitcom today, but she said that she enjoys ELR because it is more family-oriented.  I like it because I love to see Brad Garrett, the guy who plays Raymond's older and quirky brother.  He plays a brother who always feels second-place, and you can feel that weight in his face as the years go on.  How can you not like this guy!  By the way, this show has some strong language, like d*** and the B-word.  It also has references to sex.  So probably not for younger children.",1101945600,7,2104,4.741046831955923

I was at that Letterman taping.  Mel Gibson was the primary guest (he rode in on a horse and was there to promote ""Braveheart"" which was to open the next day), Romano was next, and final guest Tara Fitzgerald got bumped.  You can hear my laugh when Ray reaches for his keys in his back pocket - I anticipated the punchline.

The ELR shows themselves represent what can be so great about sitcoms --- slice-of-life comedy that doesn't seek to be offensive or controversial.  ELR explores the minutiae of family life and family dynamics that many of us can identify with and, from a safe distance, laugh at.

2049064,5,B0001ZMWXW,"Families are an interesting thing. The trials and tribulations of families have been playing on our TV sets for decades and decades. ELR is one of the finest and sharpest family sitcomes to ever air. Not to mention one of the most truthful and realistic as well. The show is about Ray Barone(Ray Romano), a sportswriter living in Long Island. His wife Debra(Patricia Heaton), a typical, everyday housewife and loving wife and mother to their three kids, Ally, and twin boys, Michael and Jeffrey. Across the street is Ray's family. His mother Marie(The brilliant Doris Roberts), is a loving, but somewhat suffocating mother and mother in law, who only wants to help and nurture, even when she comes off as intrusive and mind numbingly insufferable. Dad Frank(Peter Boyle), is a loutish type guy who only wants a sofa, snacks, and TV. Then their is big brother Robert(Brad Garrett), an incredibly tall cop with an eating problem still living at home. The first season sets up what the show is and what it will be in the future, when it really settles in and becomes a classic. This first season is full of great moments. ""I Love You"" has Debra wondering why Ray can't say those three little words. Ray becomes jealous of Frank when the older Barone gets published in Reader's Digest in ""Frank, The Writer"". ""Turkey Or Fish"" has Debra preparing the Thanksgiving meal and offers fish instead. Ray learns some disappointing news about a childhood keepsake from his father in ""The Ball"", and there are a number of others. The writing on the show is some of the sharpest and intelligent writing seen on any sitcome of any era. It is whipsmart funny and hits close to home. The real truth of this will continue to evolve over the season. I have never seen a family show that is so real, it feels like it could exactly be you. It was also a smart move on the show's part by not falling into the usual family sitcom cliches and have it be about the cute kids while everyone else plays second fiddle. No, the show may be about family, but it's mostly about the adults. You barely see the kids much. Romano's deadpan delivery and hound dog look makes him one of the best regular joe schmo's to be on TV. It is also different to see his portrayal of a dad that isn't a doofus for the sake of comedy, or a real doting dad type. Heaton's Debra is the ultimate wife/mother. A lot of her work are what Emmy's for comedy were made for. And what can be said about Doris Roberts?. A mother in law finally depicted in a way so many of us can relate to. The ongoing friction between her and Debra are some of the funniest and most entertaining material on TV. And the rest of them?. Perfection. Peter Boyle is the only one not to win an emmy, and it is long overdue. His portrayal of Frank is priceless. Brad Garrett is a man of many talents, and his performance as Robert has been one of the most intriguin ones on a sitcom in a long time. Everybody truly does love Raymond, and so will you. If only the dying art of the sitcom world can be more like this show.",1093651200,,3040,4.430357142857143

2049067,4,B0001ZMWXW,"The first season of ""Raymond"" is very different in tone and delivery than it was in years to come. Many shows hit their stride right out of the box and others have to adapt to the talents on hand and run with things that explode later on. It took a while for the writers of ""Raymond"" to find the voice of each character and form them accordingly. The now-iconic personalities didn't gel until the middle of the first season. But when they did, it became a legend.

The writers weren't the only ones searching about. As just one example, actor Brad Garrett tinkered around before he found the literal voice of Robert: He completely altered his delivery from a coarse baritone to a mopey bass as he learned what clicked with the audience.

It's fun watching the characters develop and the actors begin to own their parts. Romano will readily admit he's the weakest actor but - like Jerry Seinfeld - he tethers the rest of the cast together. And what a cast! Special props to Patty Heaton. She goes so much against the ""beleaguered sitcom wife"" stereotype that it's absolutely refreshing.

My only complaint? No Play All function. In fact, this is one of those annoying formats that makes you go through two menus to watch each episode. Play All should be industry standard by now.",1093305600,28,1278,4.621145374449339
2049068,5,B0001ZMWXW,"Everybody Loves Raymond is saturated with satire and good humor. Unlike some other shows, it has more of an indepth look on the parents side, rather than relying on the kids for laughs. This show can produce a laugh easily from even the toughest critic. Weither its from the insanly good intenional mother, or raymond's hysterical comebacks. This is one of televisions greatest shows. From the all-american classic 'The Simpsons' to the hit show 'friends' Raymond fits in beutifully as one of americas greatist sitcoms.",1090108800,3,519,5.117647058823529
2049069,5,B0001ZMWXW,"This has got to be the only sitcom in the world that made me laugh time and time again. All charecters in this wonderfully thought out long running comedy are superb. ever since it aired on CBS, i couldn't stop watching it because the comedy just keeps on rolling and stories that develop show with outragous outcomes and every aspect about this emmy winning comedy is fantastic. It's great, and now you can see how the epical sitcom that is known throughout the world started. 1st season DVD of 'Everybody Loves Raymond' is a great way to start your sitcom collection and don't forget other great titles like 'M*A*S*H', 'Will & Grace', 'Friends' and one the best sitcoms in the world 'Fraiser'.
10/10. This DVD will crack you up and keep you entertained, no matter how many times you watch it.",1089936000,3,794,4.638297872340425

8019079,1,B0001ZMWXW,"Not sure how this  sitcom got on the air to begin with. I tried watching it a few times both on CBS and then in reruns but couldn't handle the horrible comedic timing of Ray Romano or his goofy family. The only person I kinda liked was Ms Heaton, but other than that... sorry NOT funny! Maybe thats why Jerry Seinfeld has this show beaten by a few thousand miles.",1514160000,,363,4.185714285714286
