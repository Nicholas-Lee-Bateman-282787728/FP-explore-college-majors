8121213,5,B000FDFSKY,"If you want to see the cd come alive this is it!!! I have heard the cd over and over but I enjoy it alot more just to see the emphasis on the songs.
I have come to appreciate the artist work into the flow of songs and thier ministry to god. Get it you will not be disappointed.",1207526400,,277,3.711864406779661
8121214,5,B000FDFSKY,This DVD starts off powerful and ends powerful. If you loved the CD then you'll definately love the DVD. You not only get to see Martha in action but also the musical ensemble that accompanies... they're none to mess with. The visuals are pretty and pleasent to the eyes and the editing is great. I just wish that the DVD's extras and behind the scenes were longer than just 10 minutes.,1179878400,,386,4.450704225352113
8121215,4,B000FDFSKY,I love it! The worship was fantastic!  I only gave it a 4 because I did not think that disc 2 was as strong as the songs on disc 1.  Still it is worth the investment!,1167955200,,166,3.5833333333333335
