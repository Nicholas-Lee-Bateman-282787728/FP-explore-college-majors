4620686,5,B003BNCMS6,"This is a well-made indy film that has a pretty interesting premise that's supposedly based on a real story.
It's about how our government used to use young boys to track down aliens and then agents would go in and kill them.
The main plot is about 2 of these boys who are now grown men and are pretty screwed up from a life of constant hunting.
Some good action & fight scenes.
After I watched the film, I did some researching on the web and found a lot of documentation that supports the theory!",1271808000,4,497,4.242105263157895
4620687,1,B003BNCMS6,"Bad?  Let me count the ways.
Poor production values.  At most, $50,000 expended on this cheese fest.  My kid's kindergarten class acted less woodenly than did these (and I use the term very generously) actors.
Plot of aliens in human form is so cheesy that I wonder the gentleman who wrote and directed this mind numbingly bad movie, was willing to take credit for having done so.
Watch only if the only other option is a root canal sans anesthetic.",1365206400,,449,4.5875
4620688,3,B003BNCMS6,"A good ""B"" movie. Had 3 episodes of buffering using ""Lightning"" (BrightHouse/Road Runner) using their ""ubee"" modem wired to a ""Linksys E3000"" router for streaming.",1365120000,,163,5.56
4620689,4,B003BNCMS6,"Low budget fun, a little corny, but good enough to let you relax from your day. Liked how they used San Francisco locations.",1365033600,,124,4.434782608695652
4620690,4,B003BNCMS6,"I found this little gem quite by accident and really enjoyed it. It's a small budget, big idea post-alien invasion movie with an fairly original presentation of the classic aliens are among us but only a handful of people know it story. As another reviewer said quite well the whole beginning explanation is really good with only the wrap up being a little weak. The acting is like any great indie flick in that you really get a sense that the characters are just everyday people instead of million dollar plastic actors. The villains are especially well done with just enough over the top acting to make them unlikable and evil but not so much as to enter truly campy territory. The speech and questions the villain asks in the car are especially sinister. If you like indie movies like Primer, Super, Pi or Timer you will certainly find this one original and sometimes witty.",1364169600,2,877,4.664516129032258
4620691,5,B003BNCMS6,"I liked it, even with its low budget. The back story is explained perfectly in the beginning and the story is sound. All except the car scene at the end and the main characters new life at the end, major corney.",1363996800,,211,4.170731707317073
4620692,2,B003BNCMS6,"A good story....Poor production,acting and direction. With a proper production,quality actors and direction it could be a fine movie. In the present edition 2 stars only.",1362700800,,170,5.576923076923077
4620693,4,B003BNCMS6,"This was pretty fun. It was really satisfying. Everything that needed to happen happened. It isn't a big budget film, it isn't a masterpiece, but it wasn't a waste of valuable weekend time, either. If you are into vaguely quirky low budget sci fi, this is it. Don't watch it expecting high art or studio effects, but the main character is really endearing and the sci fi aspects are fun. Yeah. Enjoy.",1362268800,2,400,4.569444444444445
4620694,4,B003BNCMS6,"This is a well done low budget Sci-fi B movie. It's a bit of a riff on the movie ""They Live"" but original enough to stand on it's own merits. The acting is above par; for these kind of independent flicks and the production values are better than you would expect, as well. Definitely better than most of what you find streaming in this category, (Beyond the Black Rainbow, I'm talking about you.) so give it a chance.",1362182400,,417,4.358974358974359
4620695,1,B003BNCMS6,"This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. At least the Attack of the Killer Tomatoes is funny. Acting is bad, the script is horrendously awful. Even better, the pace will kill you.",1283472000,,187,4.222222222222222
4620696,5,B003BNCMS6,"The Four Twenty-One is a great spoof on the science fiction genre, characters are unusual and very real.  The movie is highly entertaining. I particularly enjoyed seeing the hero played by a regular looking guy who attracts the attentions of the beautiful leading lady through his kindness and charm.  I didn't know what to expect when I bought this, but my whole family enjoyed watching this movie.  Its great to see a well done independent film without computer generated characters and slick special effects that is just pure entertainment.",1276387200,6,543,5.078651685393258
8462821,1,B003BNCMS6,"Bad, boring, slow. What's not to hate?

A lot of talking in monotone, flashbacks filmed in black & white, a lot of B&W photos. Acting was horrible.

No action at all. Just monotone talking and bad acting.

It sounded from the description to be like Men in Black, but it's so not.",1528329600,,279,4.326923076923077
8462822,1,B003BNCMS6,Poor acting.  Unreal,1528156800,,20,5.666666666666667
8462823,5,B003BNCMS6,The movie has an excellent plot which is different from other movies in the alien scifi drama. It would be nice if there was a sequel to thisthe movie was kind of abridged but well worth the money.,1368403200,,197,4.2105263157894735
8462824,1,B003BNCMS6,"A waiste of my time, 98% should have been on the clipping room floor. Just drags and drags, ice age was faster",1366761600,,110,4.045454545454546
8462825,1,B003BNCMS6,"Couldnt watch the whole thing, I was not about to waste my time.  Avoid if possible save your time.  AOK?",1366761600,,105,4.2
8462826,3,B003BNCMS6,"Kind of a poor man's Men In Black. No big special effects, and a little difficult to follow as told in flash back mode. Didn't feel it was a waste of time to watch.",1366502400,,164,3.8529411764705883
8462827,2,B003BNCMS6,Looks like a high school drama filmed on a low quality camera with a bad script.  I would not recommend.,1366502400,,104,4.2
8462828,2,B003BNCMS6,"wasnt worth the electricity it took to watch half of it, slow story line just simply a boring film, duh",1366156800,,103,4.2
8462829,5,B003BNCMS6,"A great indie film in the line of alien invasion films. It ranks up there with John Carpenter's 'They Live'. Great characters well acted. A good, suspenseful story, coherently told. The film is not a mind-boggling as 'Lunapolis' but is very similar in quality and thoughtfulness. This is the kind of film that is the reason why I watch 'low budget' independent film making.",1365811200,,373,4.84375
8462830,1,B003BNCMS6,"Total waste of time. I cannot believe one of the other reviewers thought the main character was ""endearing"" - to me he was totally boring. The story was as old as they come and the idea of recruiting children to spot aliens is ridiculous. Low budget, no acting, and no action.",1365292800,,276,4.431372549019608
