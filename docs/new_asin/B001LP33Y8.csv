8319321,2,B001LP33Y8,"Like the other reviewer stated, this series explains the history of the carrier during the war in the Pacific using World War II stock footage that is fantastic but placed all in the wrong places. That can get very irritating....

Second, this is a three disc set but all three discs are the same episode with the same stock footage. They vary only in different narrators and the addition of very poor computer graphics in trying to explain certain battles. The re-creation of the attack on Pearl Harbor was laughable. The graphics and geography were terrible.

I would avoid wasting money on this series. There are much better documentaries out there regarding the aircraft carrier in World War II.",1298160000,6,699,4.8655462184873945
8319322,3,B001LP33Y8,"I generally enjoyed the information in the videos, but cringed at the editing of the accompanying films.  They showed the wrong aircraft, the wrong targets, misidentified aircraft and ships, and even had the wrong sound effects.  They actually have quite a bit of the right footage, but for some reason decided to pad it with absolutely horribly inaccurate additional film.  Then they showed the exact same films during which they described different battles.  It really ruins what could have been an interesting and informative series.",1284595200,5,536,5.270588235294118
8319323,3,B001LP33Y8,The information provided is detailed but aimed at the history of World War II. Not much detail on the actual ships themselves. For that I had to get a different video.,1243209600,5,167,4.419354838709677
8319324,5,B001LP33Y8,"I have seen this series on television and intend to purchase a copy for ""self-study."" Aircraft carrers played a very  decisive role during Second World War and how Imperial Japan was brought to its knees when several of its flat tops were devastated by American dive bombers, hence hastened the end of the Pacific War, the saving of the lives  of young American GIs  and as recorded by  dedicated war cameramen in VICTORY AT SEA movie series.
My ancestral homeland of China is proposing of building an aircraft carrier in the near future purely to defend its vast coastline and south sea island possessions. Even if China has one or more aircraft carriers, she has no intention to flex its naval powers other than to cooperate with other nations in maintaining pirate-free sea lanes and in conducting  anti-terrorist operations worldwide, and in a very effective manner...(you may believe this or not)!!!
Thus, I want to understand the pros and cons of having and maintaining an aircraft carrier which is very  expensive and calls for extensive technical know-how as well.  It is exciting to know and understand the awesome power of a military floating city in a crusing Aircraft Carrier and its day to day activities abroad...!",1241913600,,1228,4.932038834951456
