7565051,5,B0197DPJCO,"A fresh take on the fabled 'gold rush' of the Wild West era, Dominion Creek chronicles the tale of the Connolly boys,Tom,Seamus and Padraig, hopeful Irish brothers who left their homeland for the rich promise of a new life in the US. Alas, the backbreaking work in Montana's silver mines is hardly what they'd envisioned, but rumors of a much bigger payday in the Yukon--stark, beautiful, frozen-- entice Seamus (portrayed by Dana Devaney) to impulsively head north. His brothers follow with less enthusiasm, uncertain of what they'll find by staking a claim in the gold rush town of Dominion. The unfolding tale includes new acquaintances--the captivating Kate, played by Call the Midwife's Siobhan O'Kelly, and taciturn Skookum Jim, played by Julian Black Antelope--new worries, via nasty encounters with surly Jacob Hopkins, the town ringleader (Robert O'Mahoney) and a new stroke of luck when the Connollys find gold. Will greed consume the brothers who have come so far together?

This adventurous series was filmed in Ireland's Connemara region (yes the place with the glorious marble, and the beautiful horses), and in keeping with the characters' heritage, they often speak the Gaelic language (subtitles available for those of us whose Irish grandmas are no longer here to readily translate.) The locale is lovely and the storyline of a Western featuring Irishmen is novel. Acorn's two-disc set provides some nifty deleted scenes that add another layer to the intrigue, and the cast interviews offer their perspective on this absorbing drama. View this four-episode gem with ready access to cocoa or coffee, because the raw chill of the Yukon rushes from the screen.",1461715200,2,1675,5.226765799256506
7565052,2,B0197DPJCO,"I very much wanted to like this series.  For the most part, the acting was first-rate and I liked the decision for the Irish to speak Gallic to each other with subtitles for those of us unfamiliar with this beautiful language.  I'm sure Dominion Creek gave a fairly realistic picture of how hard life was in a mining town during the Klondike Gold Rush...however, pretty much everyone was awful and/or acted in an incredibly stupid manner.  And by watching the episodes back to back, one saw some plot holes that an elephant would fall into.  I know it's hard to get Yukon-worthy snow drifts in Irish filming locations (which are lovely), but the cold and snow is an iconic feature of the Klondike Gold Rush (see Jack London's To Light a Fire) and it's a shame the writers/producers/director couldn't figure out some way to incorporate them.

***SPOILERS***
Back to the snow.  The episode that takes place in September ends with snow beginning to fall and the brothers shut out of being able to purchase supplies in town.  The next episode takes place in March where there is a festive St. Patrick's Day parade through a town surrounded by snowless and very green, grassy views.  And no mention of how the brothers supplied themselves through the frozen months.
And the ""good"" brother...why, in heaven's name, would not warn his brothers he had overheard an enemy plotting against them?  Especially when he hears (which was inevitable) one brother has partnered with said enemy in a business deal.
This brother, who is probably supposed to come across as carefree and likable, is instead just obnoxious and fully lives up to the insult his older brother hurls at him in the first few minutes of the show.  And lives up to it over and over.  Which makes the actions of the Irish singer unfathomable. I think we are meant to root for them as a couple but it's difficult to muster interest when one person's few remarks to her are just annoying instead of appealing, as she is expected to find them.
And while the Royal Canadian Mounted Police provide a colorful visual against all the green and one figures in an important subplot, they are fairly useless as enforcers of law and order.  The superintendent seems very concerned with punishing petty thefts in order to get firewood chopped but ignores abuse as girls are forced into and kept in prostitution and greater crimes are going on under his nose.
Finally, the ""return"" at the end make no sense whatsoever.  None.  Not one bit logical reason except to make a viewer cry out ""oh no you didn't, you stupid person.""",1460764800,3,2566,4.7242152466367715
7565053,5,B0197DPJCO,"An Klondike is the original Irish title of Dominion Creek. It reveals life and death in the Yukon during the days of the gold rush, especially as it happened for the 3 Irish Connolly brothers. Tom the older stable level-headed, Seamus a bit of a middle-child mess, and Padraig with the softer personality who helps a pastor in his hospital and chapel. They meet and include in their claim an Indian named Skookum Jim, a real person of history played well by Julian Black Antelope who also has credit in Hell on Wheels. If you liked Hell on Wheels, then you will like dominion Creek. The actors make this community of Irish seem believable, as well as others viewers meet at Dominion Creek (a real location).
Location: Filmed in western Irelands Connemara region, having been there, I can acclaim to the beauty, a perfect location for a 19th century Canadian mining drama. As wild and rugged a west as exists in the contemporary world. Although fictional, DOMINION CREEK is reasonable portrayal of what it was really like back then, mining, panning, and living rough and tumble and wild. I did some research and was impressed with the set, costume, and detail accuracy for this historic gold event.

Several Audio and SUBTITLE options. When Irish characters talk with each other they speak in Gaelic, or have the Irish as the folk say. Subtitles translate the Gaelic dialogue. Other subtitle options include English dubbed audio with or without the optional SDH SUBTITLES.
1. ===August 1897; Connolly brothers mining in Montana head to the Klondike River in the Canadian Yukon to find their golden fortune guided by a coded map. The boys soon have friends and more enemies among local townsfolk of Dominion. Action gets rough and bloody.
2. ===September 1897; Hopkins and Connolly fighting grows.  Samus finds romance in dangerous places. Two brothers continue mining for gold at their claim. The creed of Dominion is every man for himself.
3. ===March 1898; St. Patty's Day, Dominion style parade finds the saloon needs more brothelettes. Kate holds her secret. A gold find causes the brothers to turn against each other. Theres deals and double-deals.
4.  ===Brothers relationships decline further. A disaster forces Seamus against his clan. In the end viewers will feel like they were a part of a Klondike Gold Rush town; but also relieved they survived (not all in the 1890s did so.)
Bonus===An hour of interesting interviews and deletes, with subtitles.",1458777600,5,2457,4.97323600973236

8744301,3,B0197DPJCO,Very disappointed in the second season of this show. I watched the first season with mostly English spoken now I get to the second season and have to read the words and can't enjoy the show and all the scenery. I'm going to finish watching it just because I need to know what happens and its a good story,1536105600,,304,4.169491525423729

8744307,1,B0197DPJCO,This is the worst western I have ever seen. Not only is the location not believable. Canada never looked like this place. The Indians aren't even close to real American Indians. The guns are wrong along with the horses and costumes. The fake mining operation and cabin are unrealistic. Nothing in this story is authentic. It is a joke.,1490572800,2,335,4.694915254237288

8744309,4,B0197DPJCO,"Pretty good, but not quite the level of  Deadwood or Klondike.  Portrays the Irish gold seekers as greedy, sleazy, and ignorant as they probably were.  And this is a Made in Ireland series.  Looking forward to Season 2.

Congrats to the producers of the DVD for including English dubbing along with SDH sub-titles.  Great soundtrack.  Too bad it's not available for purchase.",1485043200,,375,4.951612903225806
