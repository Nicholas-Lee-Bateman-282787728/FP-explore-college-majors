8537381,5,B0097BJD2Y,"First a disclosure: I love gala's. Although not really a Gala, this DVD offers artists appearing in showcases of various productions with opera house scenery. That said, this is a very delightful mix of DVD familiar productions and those not usually presented for viewing. The same could be said of the artists who appear on this DVD. They were talented representatives of the current artists from around the globe, singing gloriously in great productions from the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. This DVD is easily recommended for those who wish to have some current productions and artists. Enjoyed every piece presented, it could have been longer but was well worth the purchase price.",1456185600,,690,5.115044247787611

8537384,3,B0097BJD2Y,"I absolutely love the Royal Ballet, they are by far one of the best classical ballet companies on the planet. This video is a sampling of snippets from several ballets and, though the dancing is beautiful as always, it left me wanting to see more of each ballet. I would recommend going with the full length ballet videos instead of this miscellaneous sample collection.",1383868800,,370,4.796875
8537385,4,B0097BJD2Y,The first half of the disc was great.  The second half less so.  Perhaps. My opinions are biased by my preference for zItalian operas,1375315200,,133,4.5

8537387,5,B0097BJD2Y,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my aunt, who loves opera. She was very impressed with the pieces it contains based on what she read on the box, but that's about all I can say about it as I haven't spoken to her yet to see if she's viewed it. If I get feedback from her I will update my review.",1358035200,2,299,3.761904761904762
8537388,5,B0097BJD2Y,"The performance excerpts contained on this DVD are from La Traviata, a more modern Carmen, Le Noe Di Figaro, La Boheme, Die Zauberflote, Dido and Aeneas, ... well, you get the idea.  And the performers showcased herein are the best in the business - Renee Fleming, Joseph Calleja, Jonas Kaufmann, Sarah Connoly, Diana Damrau, Simon Keenlyside, Bryn Terfel, Jose Cura...and the conductors featured include Antonio Pappano, Christopher Hogwood, Charles Mackerras, Andris Nelsons, Colin Davis, Bernard Haitink, et al.  In short, there is no shortage of star power anywhere you look on this disc.

Particularly satisfying is the interaction between Renee Fleming and Joseph Calleja in Libiamo ne' lieti calici, as well as Simon Keenlyside's rendition of Pa-pa-pa-pa.  But for me, the Purcell (Didi's Lament) was stunning and worth the price of the DVD in and of itself.

This is a wonderful DVD, both for the experienced opera aficionado as well as for the neophyte looking to get a taste of what all the fuss is about.  Buy it -- you won't be disappointed!",1356998400,4,1053,5.057803468208093
