8391283,3,B0038EG20M,"These movies are not the best of quality.
That said they contain several very interesting and informative tales from a period of history that is quickly becomming just that, history, as those among us that had personal recollections age and leave.
They are a good testimony to the selflessness of what is known as the ""greatest generation"" and are balanced between a UK and US perspective.
One CD is primarily three movies from British wartime studios, the other CD is American.
The quality of each film is directly attributable to the quality of the original cellulite rolls, ""Spitfire"" possibly being the poorest of the group and ""Gung Ho"" marginally the best.

It was indicated I'd not listed the movies, so here they are:
The US side of the set contained ""A Walk In The Sun"", ""Gung Ho"" and ""Go For Broke""
The UK side of the set contained ""Spitfire"", ""One Of Our Aircraft Is Missing"" and ""We Dive At Dawn"".

Although ""Spitfire"" was the poorest quality, it was one of the better films. It covers the design of the aircraft and life of the designer. Iconic.
""One Of Our Aircraft"" had Williams and Ustinov trying to evade capture in occupied Holland, got an academy award nod in 1941.
""We Dive At Dawn"" - John Mills heads up the mini submarine crews in a suicide mission to Norway from Scotland.
""A Walk In The Sun"" followed an infantry company [US] from the beaches in Italy part way through the Italian campaign.
""Gung Ho"" is the story of Carlson's raiders in the far east
""Go For Broke"" is a good movie about Japanese Americans fighting for Uncle Sam and the prejudices they endured - couple of academy nods from that one.

For those with an interest all were very watchable.
As a history lesson, propaganda included, they are very valuable.
If you expect films of this era with the technology limits they had available during production you will not be disappointed, but if you must have colorized or digitally remastered this particular set might not be your best option.",1318982400,5,1976,4.688760806916426
8391284,1,B0038EG20M,"How can you expect people to purchase movies, when you do not even indicate the titles?

Is this too much to ask?

Absolutley unbelievable to think that people are expected to buy a movie without knowing the title or the major actors.",1104710400,8,234,4.5476190476190474
