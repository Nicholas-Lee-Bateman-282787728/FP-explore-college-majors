8718410,5,B00YIZWJ20,"This movie is very exciting and fascinating to see how Africa looked almost 100 years ago.  The Johnsons were able to get very good close up movies of the animals from their planes and the footage they took of Mount Kilamanjaro is better than any photos you can see from an online image search taken in our day although not in color, they got great shots of the peak of the mountain from their planes.",1471651200,,401,4.346666666666667
