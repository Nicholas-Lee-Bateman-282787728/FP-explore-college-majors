2423151,5,B000BKVL9I,Pompeii Buried Alive is a great DVD showing scenes of an ancient society that I had not seen before. I recommend this DVD to anyone who loves Ancient Historical Facts!,1288310400,2,167,4.6
2423152,5,B000BKVL9I,"BOUGHT IT AS PART OF MY RESEARCH BEFORE VISITING POMPEII LAST YEAR. FOUND IT VERY INFORMATIVE ESPECIALLY SINCE I LEARNED WHEN I DID VISIT THAT THERE AREN'T ANY SIGNS ON ANYTHING SO THE MORE YOU LEARN AHEAD OF TIME, THE BETTER!!",1271721600,7,227,4.560975609756097
2423153,2,B000BKVL9I,"I'm not sure why the other reviewers have given this DVD such high marks.  I received this DVD as a Christmas gift.  My family and I excitedly sat down to watch it the day after Christmas, and all of us felt let down afterwards.  First of all, you can't go into any real depth in just 50 minutes.  It's a really cursory overview - and not a very good one.  Second, they didn't even focus solely on the event itself!  There were pontificating ""experts"" going on about how horrible the Pompeiians were to own slaves and how women weren't treated equally.  Could someone please tell me what the &^#$^% that has to do with Pompeii being buried alive?  I was expecting some video and photos of the Pompeii ruins as they are today, with those being tied in to what happened on that fateful day.  No such luck.  I was hoping for some insight into the people of Pompeii whose remains were found - what might they have been doing at the time this happened?  What was the city of Pompeii like pre-eruption?  What would have been some of the daily activities of those people?  I know, given the short length of the documentary, that they couldn't have gone into any real detail; but couldn't they have then at least focused all of the time they did have to painting a real portrait of what happened that day?  Did we really need the preaching from modern-day historians about how un-enlightened the people were 2,000 years ago?  The crowning hallmark of any documentary is the viewer walking away from it knowing more about the subject than he/she did before.  In that, it failed miserably.",1269734400,34,1579,4.5265017667844525
2423154,4,B000BKVL9I,"I saw this documentary just before going to Pompeii.  It was very informative even though made several years ago (what the heck, the eruption was in 79AD.)

A good way to prepare yourself for visiting the real thing.",1247788800,5,216,4.657894736842105
2423155,5,B000BKVL9I,This is a well-done production using a lot of imagination with real facts and images.  I recently toured Pompeii and felt like I knew the people who died there.  This DVD worked well with my Latin students after we studied Pompeii.  I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in Pompeii's history.,1229990400,12,303,4.788461538461538
2423156,4,B000BKVL9I,This history has always interested me.  This DVD lives up to satisfy anyones curiosity.  Buy cheap and you will not be disappointed.,1213833600,4,132,4.954545454545454
2423157,5,B000BKVL9I,This realy happened and it was tragic. In those times there was no TV or Radio to warn people of a disaster coming. Good true story.,1171152000,7,132,4.115384615384615
2423158,3,B000BKVL9I,"Excellent in content, but the proliferation of erotic art make it unsuitable for classroom use (that is for 6th graders studying Ancient Roman Civilization). Recommended for mature viewers only.",1116460800,12,194,5.724137931034483

8088390,4,B000BKVL9I,"I got this DVD as an upgrade from the original VHS release.  As another reviewer noted, it's narrated by Leonard Nimoy, not Kathleen Turner.  For some reason (probably contracts and money), the Ancient Mysteries series was re-recorded with Nimoy's narration when re-released on DVD (we also have the Troy VHS & DVD in the same series).  I like Turner better, but the teachers who use the program don't care.  The 50-minute length may be unable to go into serious scholarly depth, but is just right for classroom use.",1386288000,,516,4.829545454545454
8088391,2,B000BKVL9I,"I was expecting better! This is NOT narrated by Kathleen Turner but Leonard Nimoy. Doesn,t really matter! I have been to Pompeii and think there was much more content that could have been included!",1382313600,,197,4.823529411764706
8088392,2,B000BKVL9I,I found this documentary very shallow. The interviews were not in depth and it would have been better to focus on specific topics and present such with more detail. I would recommend to get instead: Pompeii: Back from the Dead instead or Pompeii: The Last Day.,1349913600,,260,4.673913043478261
8088393,4,B000BKVL9I,order this video before you go and see it and you will appreciate it more. Learn more and know what to expect.,1332979200,,110,4.045454545454546
8088394,5,B000BKVL9I,I bought this along with a book on Pompeii for research for a report my son needed done from school. Both this movie and the book were very informative. I would recommend watching this even for entertainment purposes.,1325808000,,217,4.7368421052631575
