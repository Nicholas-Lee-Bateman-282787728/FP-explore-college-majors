He escapes with 6 other killers to exact vengeance on Sam Burgade(Charlton Heston) the lawman who not only captured him but was also responsible for the death of Provo's wife,at least in Provo's mind. Part of his plan is to kidnap Burgade's daughter,which prompts him to strap on his guns and go after him on horseback. Can Brugade who has been retired for sometime still have what it takes to track Provo down and kill him this time.............Heston and Coburn prove why they don't make them like this any longer,Heston and Coburn were legends.

747628,3,6303984266,"James Coburn plays a violent  mixed race outlaw who escapes from Yuma prison as part of a chain gang along with a group of other equally thuggish types .He persuades them to join him by recounting tales of a hidden cache of gold that will make them all rich men ;his primary motive is to use tham to help him gain revenge on his nemesis ,a retired lawman (Charlton Heston)responsible for his incarceration..He lures Heston away from town by feinting to rob a gold shipment being conveyed by train and while the lawman is engaged on this wild goose chase rides into town at the head of his gang and abductes Heston's daughter (Barbara Hershey).There  follows a sadistic ,violent denouement involving rape and a great deal of rather gloating violence
This is well acted by the stars and supporting cast .It has an excellent score and the photography is exemplary .The themes of violence and retribution are punched across with some vigour but for many the stumbling block here will be the lip-smacking violence and rape which feature heavily in the storyline .This is sad in a way because there are some thoughful elegaic moments as we witness the passing of an era -the trains have refrigeration and an automobile features prominently in one scene .This strain of the story  gets lost in the scenes of slow motion death and protracted revenge

This is strong meat and for me tipped over into the pornography of violence rather too often for comfort but many will not be troubled by this ansd will enjoy the spectacle of two considerable actors in a strong drama",1194307200,12,1560,4.724264705882353
747629,4,6303984266,"Easily one of the least-known western movies in history to pair two great actors against one another, THE LAST HARD MEN is a painfully underrated sagebrush saga that at first might seem old-fashioned but turns out to be a very timely meditation on the final days of the West.  It is on video now through Unicorn, but this 1976 film deserves to be released by its original distributor, 20th Century Fox, on video and DVD in its uncut form.  It only runs 97 minutes here; in its uncut form, it was 105 minutes.

Based on the 1972 novel ""Gun Down"" by Brian Garfield, who also wrote ""Death Wish"" and is a western enthusiast, THE LAST HARD MEN stars Charlton Heston as an aging lawman who had once been a proud member of the Arizona Territorial Police but now in 1908 has now turned the reins of law enforcement over to a reform-minded younger man (Michael Parks).  He laments about how the railroad changed the makeup of the West--that and, as Parks points out, the auto, the telegraph, and the telephone.

But before Heston can really call it quits, he has to contend with a vengeful half-breed outlaw (James Coburn) whom he put away fifteen years earlier for a train robbery near Santa Fe that killed Coburn's wife.  Coburn is out to settle the score with Heston; and to force Heston into a fatal confrontation, he kidnaps Heston's daughter (Barbara Hershey) and allows his sadistic gang to rape her.  The result is a jarring and frequently violent pursuit through the Arizona mountains and deserts.

Surprisingly, even though the film was directed by Andrew V. McLaglen, who worked with John Wayne on several of the Duke's later westerns and who normally modelled his directing style off of John Ford, THE LAST HARD MEN has the hard edge of a Sam Peckinpah film, right down to the themes of the demise of the Old West, unchanging men in changing times, and jarring bursts of bloodshed and violence sometimes rent in slow-motion (hence the 'R' rating).  McLaglen nevertheless directs the proceedings with professionalism.  Coburn makes for an absolutely chilling main villain, and his gang, which includes Jorge Rivero, John Quade, and Robert Donner, rank right up there with the bounty hunters of THE WILD BUNCH and the sadistic rednecks of DELIVERANCE for sheer nastiness.  Heston, meanwhile, gives probably the best performance of any that he gave during the 1970s as the aging lawman forced to put on the badge one more time.  Christopher Mitchum also does well as Hershey's soon-to-be husband.

The score by Jerry Goldsmith, though it is cribbed from his scores to the 1966 remake of STAGECOACH and 1969's 100 RIFLES, is flavorful enough (Leonard Rosenman was supposed to have done the original score).  Filmed entirely on location near Tucson, Arizona, THE LAST HARD MEN deserves to be seen, as it is a worthy, if frequently violent, saga, but hopefully it will one day be seen in its original 1976 cut.",1093305600,37,2907,4.799599198396794

748132,3,6303984266,"I saw this movie decades ago and remember it as terrific, though brutal, especially for the time it was made. Others have commented on the rape scene, which, while a believable outcome of a young woman being kidnapped and held for an extended period by outlaws, weakens the film. Of course, many times we've seen a young woman at the mercy of a sadistic madman, and think 'of course, he'd rape her,' but it doesn't happen. The woman escapes, the hero arrives etc. Sigh of relief. The Last Hard Men doesn't permit that release. But hey, this ain't Shakespeare, it's a western. Improbable or not, we want the her to escape; revenge alone isn't sufficient. So an otherwise very good film leaves a bad aftertaste.

In a way, this is similar to Charles Bronson's Chato's Land, also a very good movie that deserves to be better known. Bronson plays an Indian whose wife is raped by a posse that's out after him. The differences in Chato's Land are that we never get to spend time with and know the woman, and the assault is off screen. That doesn't mean it's any less a horrific crime, but it doesn't hit you on the same emotional level.

See The Last Hard Men if you enjoy tough, gritty action, but be prepared to not swagger out of the theater, so to speak, with that familiar ""the hero comes through again"" feeling.

A reviewer mentioned that the original version is 107 minutes and the VHS version 98. Anyone know what version's on this DVD? (Hey, maybe it deletes the rape scene and you can ignore my review.)",1361145600,,1508,4.516483516483516

It's a pure joy to see these two in their original aspect ratio of 2.35 (even though the cover says 1.78)! This comes from an era when they really made widescreen movies (such as other classics from the '70s: Chinatown, Jaws, to name a few). These movies really suffered over the years in poorly pan and scan videotape editions. Shout! just keeps releasing these classics that no other company would dare touch. They just keep outdoing themselves. The two movies on this disc aren't the greatest, but the five star rating is for the product and not the movies themselves. I am so tired of reading reviews of people bashing the films and not telling us the quality of the DVD. For a two on one disc, this looks amazing! There aren't too many compression problems that are too distracting. I prefer to have each movie on its own disc, but hey as long as its done right...
This is a great double feature that looks really good for the price you pay.

Coburn, fantastic just a year later in Cross of Iron is SO nasty & evil its over the top. Heston, equally fantastic in Major Dundee 10 years earlier, is too old in his role going after Coburn who kidnaps his daughter Hershey. Barbara Hershey is the only one worth watching here.

7857756,3,6303984266,"Released in 1976 and directed by Andrew V. McLaglen, The Last Hard Men is a Western starring Charlton Heston as Burgade, a retired law enforcement officer in Arizona, 1909. When a vicious half-breed outlaw, Provo (James Coburn), escapes from a Yuma prison with several other thugs Burgade gets back in the saddle, literally, because Provos coming after him and his daughter (Barbara Hershey). Michael Parks plays the sheriff who initially assists Burgade while Jorge Rivero plays Provos right hand man.

This movies an interesting cinematic study: It has all the right elements for a great Western, but its curiously mediocre in execution. The screenplay was taken from Brian Garfields 1971 novel Gundown and Garfield was on set for uncredited rewrites. If you're not familiar with him, he wrote the book that birthed the 1974 hit Death Wish. Add to this a proven Western director and a great cast (How can you go wrong with Heston and Coburn?). Furthermore, the movie features authentic Arizona locations (where Garfields from) with much of the story taking place in the rugged wilderness of the high country. Moreover, the film has a quality score. While Leonard Rosenman was supposed to compose an original score, it fell through and so the producers concocted a pastiche from four of Jerry Goldsmiths past compositions: 100 rifles (1969), Ro Conchos (1964), Morituri (1965) and Stagecoach (1966). This explains why the music sounds pleasantly familiar to those whove seen any of these movies. Lastly, this isn't a lame old-fashioned Western, it was shot in the gritty realistic style of Sam Peckinpah, one of Garfields favorite directors, and, as such, theres a lot of wicked violence, including a rape scene.

Unfortunately the movies only decent. There are some interesting bits interspersed throughout, but the characters come across as dull and the storys strangely un-compelling (your mind frequently wanders). Burgade (Heston) and Provo (Coburn) are two prime examples of the flat characters. The formers just an uninteresting person (the express opposite of Taylor in Planet of the Apes) while the latter comes across as a one-dimensional vengeful villain whom Ricardo Montalban probably used as a prototype for his cartoony portrayal of Khan in 1982s Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (which is in contrast to his fascinating portrayal of Khan in the 1966 episode Space Seed).

Garfield complained about the title of the movie on the grounds that it was originally set to be called Burgade (again, from his novel Gundown) and The Last Hard Men sounds like a porno flick, he argued. But both Gundown and Burgade are pretty dang generic sounding to me. At least The Last Hard Men ties into the theme of the film, which, incidentally, was nothing new at the time in light of Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), The Wild Bunch (1969), Big Jake (1971) and several others, not to mention The Shootist (1976), which came out a couple months after The Last Hard Men. So I don't have a problem with the title. That said, I asked my wife if she wanted to see a Western and she replied Which one? I said, The Last Hard Men. She responded, Ooh baby, yes!

The film runs 98 minutes and was shot in Arizona (too many places to cite).
