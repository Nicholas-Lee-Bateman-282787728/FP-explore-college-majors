7955862,1,B00005UWE8,"This is absolutely THE WORST movie that I have ever seen. Worse even than Pootie Tang, Freddie Got Fingered, or Hobo With a Shotgun. I would watch any of those on endless loops for the rest of eternity before ever sitting down and wasting the time, energy and brain cells that this absolute cinematic travesty cost me. In case it isn't obvious, I really didn't like this movie.",1421712000,,377,4.5588235294117645
7955863,1,B00005UWE8,"I bought this movie for $1.00 brand new... Worst $1.00 ever spent.  I would rather have used that money to buy a bottle of peroxide and poured it into my eyes.  I am a fan of bad movies but this isn't even watchable.  I couldn't even follow what was going on and the script...  I don't think there was a script.  For the ten minutes I saw, I could barely tell what what being said. It's just a bunch of friends who got together one night, picked up a VHS Camera and started filming random ideas they came up on the spur of the moment.",1297555200,,534,4.0476190476190474
7955864,1,B00005UWE8,"This has got to be THE WORST movie I have ever seen, besides the Hell 2 The Naw one by the same company.  This was a ""remix"" version of the stupid Blair Witch Project.  The women were screaming so much in this movie it had me BEGGING if my boyfriend could turn the stupid movie off.  The acting was horrible.  The DVD box had typos on it.  The graphics were not digital so the quality of the picture was AWFUL.  It deserves to be on HOTGHETTOMESS.com.  This was below B-Rated.  It was a waste of $4.99.",1107734400,3,502,4.15625
