It's heartwarming and wholesome and just leaves me feeling sort of happy and content, which doesn't happen much with the TV shows of today. Life was so much simpler then.",1437955200,,269,4.510204081632653
8098713,1,B000CEXG8C,My daughter is a big fan of Ozzie and Harriet. She loved The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet Vol. 1. I ordered volume 2 for her birthday and had to return it because inside the case was the DVD of volume 1.  I placed another order a few months later for volume 2 again and the same thing happened again. The DVD of volume 1 was inside the case of what should have been volume 2. Very disappointed.,1437696000,,397,4.089743589743589
