8594072,5,B000ACP9GS,"Critic's Choice Video has released 4 Digitally Restored episodes of the Classic 1950's TV Show Starring Edgar Buchanon as Judge Roy Bean. Other cast members include: Jack Beutel, Russell Hayden and Jackie Loughery. These episodes are top of the line in video quality. You sure can say that they were digitally restored as it shows. Edgar Buchanon portrays the famous Judge in an acting style like you have never seen before, Beholding the Truths & Upholding Law and Order West of the Pecos River. His acting is superb next to that of his future ""Uncle Joe"" fame as seen on the 1960's TV show Petticoat Junction.
The 4 episodes include the pilot in B&W ""The Judge of the Pecos Valley"" from 1955. Followed by 3 Color Episodes from 1956: ""The Eyes of Texas (Episode #19)"", ""Family Ties (Episode #2)"", ""Spirit of the Law (Episode # 28)""
This series only ran for 39 Episodes and does not currently (As of June 2007) have a complete episode collection release. Though it should have. At least 3/4 or more of all the episodes are available on numerous DVD Releases. So getting up a collection by making some internet purchases is not very costly. This is a must for fans who enjoy those good old western tv shows.",1183075200,,1206,4.640186915887851
