8555462,2,B00AOO5OLC,"This could have been a pretty good B movie had they did an English overdub like they did in the '70s.  It wouldn't have mattered at all if the lips didn't match the words.  Even the subtitles weren't done very well.  If they would have just put in a little more effort, I probably would have given it a 4 star",1422057600,,309,4.032786885245901
8555463,2,B00AOO5OLC,"""Mystikal"" a Spanish production, is a movie that has great aspirations, but falls woefully short in the budget and story line departments.  The plot is a mish-mash of ""Lord of the Rings,"" ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" with a touch of ""Return of the Jedi"" thrown in.  The story concerns a witch's young, klutzy apprentice who inadvertently frees a demon of Hell which resided in an urn the Witch was in charge of safekeeping.  With two more urns in danger of being opened before all Hell breaking loose, the apprentice, accompanied by a ""Tinkerbell""-like Nymph and a whining, effeminate Dragon, stumbles from one failed rescue to another before having to face the final Demon and somehow, despite showing no talent for being able to do so, save the day.

The movie looks like it was shot entirely on green-screen with everything added in post-production; the effects, while impressive for the sheer scope and amount used, are video-game quality at best, with choppy movements, flat rendering, and a dull, murky color palette used throughout.  The movie's subtitles (there is no English language track) are horrific, with terrible syncing, dreadfully poor translation, and occasionally, with entire scenes lacking any subtitles!  (The hero's first meeting with the aforementioned Dragon being a glaring example.)

That's not to say the movie is completely without merit - I was impressed with the scale attempted, and the design of the picture isn't half-bad.  (Well, the third Demon DID remind me strongly of a rabid hamster, when I think they were wanting something more wolf-like); but the flat characterizations, the ragged green-screen effects, and the inept subtitles pretty much sank this for me.

As far as ratings go, I would give this a PG - some fantasy violence and bloodless deaths, nothing offensive.",1363305600,3,1810,5.150170648464163
