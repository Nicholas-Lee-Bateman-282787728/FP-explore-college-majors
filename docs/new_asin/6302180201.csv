441945,4,6302180201,"If on one hand, ""La Sirne du Mississipi"" is not  Truffaut's best, on the other, it is much better than many films we see nowadays -- say, the quasi-remake of this, called ""Original Sin"", starring Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas. Both films are based on Willian Irish's --or, if you will, Cornell Woolrich's -- ""Waltz into Darkness"". But the similarities end here. While Truffaut is an exercise of style and good taste, the other, directed by Michael Cristofer, is so meaningless that is almost vulgar.
The plot is very simple, but at the same time catching. A man from Reunion Island orders a mail bride. When he meets her, she turns up to be more beautiful and dangerous than described in the letters and shown in the photos. He imedeately falls for her, and apparently so does she. We, and so does he, learn that she is not really what she meant to be. The film has some fine and exciting twists that keep you wondering what would come next.
Catherine Deneuve plays the femme fatale. She comes fresh from Buuel's ""La Belle du Jour"", where she has already exercised and improved her glacial blonde side. Here, she goes a bit further, including a bit more of dissimulantion. Not only is she beautiful, but also, very effective as the woman who can dissimulate love. Jean Paul Belmondo plays a very different character from those he had been cast for. He is a bit silly and weak. So the whole relationship is dominated by her, once she is very strong and persuasive. One clear example of this is when they are buying a car. He is sure he wants the silver one, that would be more discreet, but she wants  the red one... guess which one they buy! So, don't be fooled, this is a Catherine Deneuve's show. She is dazzingly in her Yves Saint-Laurent. She dominates the frames in every scene she is in! And even some she is out.
Another thing, many people may not understand the difference between ""tu"" and ""vous"" in this film. It is not a mistake! The writer meant to show different periods in their relationship. When they are close --things are fine-- they use `tu', but sometimes they use `vous', particulary, after spending a time apart-- this means how distant from each other --as a strange -- they became.
Truffaut's work is as always very effective and very creative. In the very beginning he does an homage to Jean Renoir, using some footage of his ""La Marseillase"" introducing Reunion Island. Although this film is meant to be a thriller, in the end, it is much more a love story. A tragic love story of a love that probably shouldn't have happened. We also have to notice how hidden and subtle the sexuality is, in this movie -- as in most of Truffaut's woks. Some of his films may be virtually sexless, but if you watch it very close, you will see sparkles of love everywhere.
As a devoted fan of Franois Truffaut, every film he made, interests me. This ""Mississipi Mermaid"" makes no exeception. It is intriguing, interesting and disturbing. ""Love hurts?"", somebody asks in the film. ""Yes, it does, when I look at you, you are so beautiful that hurts me. [...] it is a joy and a suffering"". As most of his movies: they are a joy, but they also hurt us, once they show  how human nature and love can be.",1013990400,31,3212,4.5344827586206895
441946,3,6302180201,"MISSISSIPPI MERMAID could be considered as an homage to Alfred Hitchcock. True if one appreciates the musical score of the movie very Bernard Herrmann-like or discreet little touches reminding of the english master touch. But that's all because there is any suspense in Truffaut's MISSISSIPPI MERMAID. As in THE BRIDE WORE BLACK, Truffaut kills carefully any tension that could arise in the viewer's mind.
Jean-Paul Belmondo is another variation of Antoine Doinel, the well-known Truffaut double, he is a romantic hero, speaks like a romantic hero and finally acts like a romantic hero of the french XXth century literature. On the contrary, Catherine Deneuve is the impersonation of a 1968 young woman - at least, in Truffaut's mind - egotistical, money hungry and materialistic. Their encounter cannot but produce a hiatus. Hence, the strange mood of the movie and the curious reactions of the characters almost unbelievable for the XXth century rational Truffaut fan. So if you don't know the movies of Franois Truffaut, begin your discovery with THE 400 BLOWS or THE SOFT SKIN and leave this movie for later, for the moment you will be ready to accept this peculiar love story.
Just a trailer as bonus features if one excepts the various subtitles with this MGM DVD. Images and sound no more than average.
A DVD zone make your choice.",1012694400,5,1338,5.004484304932736
441947,3,6302180201,"Both Francois Truffaut's ""Mississippi Mermaid"" and Michael Cristopher's ""Original Sin"" are based on the same Cornell Woolrich pot-boiler novel. Truffaut's version is a relatively bloodless affair especially since his stars, Catherine Deneuve and Jean Paul Belmondo play their roles as if they are slumming in ""meler-dramer"" country: they're much too polite and just plain cold, frigid even in their respective roles as Julie Roussel(really Julie Vergano) and Louis.  Deneuve, of course is woefully miscast as Julie but Belmondo, on paper at least, must have seemed ideal as the kind, sexy, considerate, obsessed Louis.  What happened? Though Truffaut was/is considered a director of the highest order, he doesn't have the requisite, particular passion to bring this very American story to life. For the same reason, if it were not for Jeanne Moreau's elegant, persuassive performance, his faux Hitchcock ""The Bride wore Black"" would have also been a failure.
In the new version ""Original Sin,"" both Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas make Julie and Louis breathe with a life force  that sets the screen on fire in a sexy, sweaty swirl of passion. These are not subtle roles....they need to played over-the-top. And this is what this material needs: not polite reverence but wild abandon.
Does this mean that Cristopher is a better director than Truffaut? No. Just better suited to the material, in this case.
On the other hand, Truffaut is a master and as such there are sublime passages in ""Mississippi Mermaid,"" especially the scenes of obsession involving Louis and Julie's under clothing. But... Mermaid is a fascinating, beautiful failure but a failure nonetheless.",1008460800,11,1671,5.321969696969697
441948,4,6302180201,"Begining rather unobtrusively, Louis (Belmondo) and Julie (Deneuve) meet for the first time after falling in love through the mail. It appears a rather normal French love tale, but soon Julie begins to show signs that there is more than meets the eye with her.
When she disappears one day, he discovers several things about her. He travels from his island off the coast of Africa to France to find her and falls ill on the journey. He finds her soon after and they begin again as if nothing happened. Louis falls effortlessly into her dark world, doing acts he would never have even thought about committing and soon they are on the run.
Truffaut shows us that under the right, or wrong circumstances any of us would do for the love of our life(especially if she is Catherine Deneuve). The thing I really loved about the film is Truffaut's subtle way of conveying the emotions of the charcters. When their love is going well it's bright and cheery, lots of yellows and sunshine, when it is going awry the colors are dark and the shadows are everywhere.
This is a unique film about love and redemption. Both Deneuve and Belmondo give wonderful performances in a classic piece of noire from the genuis that was Francios Truffaut.",1008460800,4,1227,4.658986175115207
441949,3,6302180201,"Catherine Deneuve's character is a mail-order bride who finds herself the wife of a handsome, sexy, rich plantation owner. He quickly falls in love with her. (Spoiler warning! Read no more if you can't see this coming.) Spends money like water. Pampers her. Most of us would kill to be in her pumps. Trouble is, she has. Once this becomes clear, the film, I think, starts to lose steam. I didn't find his behavior, after he tracks her down, believable. The first half-hour, as daydream material while at your desk in some death-like job, is terrific.",994896000,3,550,4.739583333333333
441950,4,6302180201,"It is hard for me to imagine a more gorgeous couple than Catherine Deneuve and Jean-Paul Belmondo.  He was also the lead in the marvelously sexy ""Breathless."" The strange thing is that two people so physically right for one another should have so much trouble staying together! Deneuve kills Belmondo's mail-order bride so she can take her place and marry him for his fortune. Belmondo's character is almost too naive but he is in love so we'll stretch a bit.  When this femme fatale takes off with his money, he pursues and finds her.  There is one setup after another with the two of them and they are forever doomed to come together, come apart.  This was Francois Truffaut's movie and I never met a movie of his I couldn't like.  This one is no exception.  Even though it is not his very best at the very peak of his powers, it is certainly very good and a good evening's entertainment for you.

441951,4,6302180201,"Although Mississippi Mermaid was considered one of Truffaut's losers,  it has charm and the personalities of the characters will stay with you.  It's clearly better than its reputation.  Said to be influenced by Hitchcock and  then rendered in the Truffautian style, it is a little off the beaten  track, and the coincidences are a little ridiculous.  Nonetheless Catherine  Deneuve is outstanding and strangely at home in a role considered by many  to be out of character for her, as though Grace Kelly might play Bonnie in  ""Bonnie and Clyde.""  This comes five years after Deneuve  charmed audiences in The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964), and two years after  her success in  Belle de Jour (1967).  She stars here as a skanky ex-home  girl with a murderous heart...  For  all her elegant beauty Deneuve does manage to look cheap and almost sleazy.  In some ways she comes to life in this role more than in any other I've  seen.  Certainly I've never seen her sexier.
Co-star Jean-Paul Belmondo  is engaging as a slightly sweet and naive tobacco farmer from Reunion  Island (near Madagascar) who gets Deneuve as a mail order bride, she and  her bad boyfriend having first dumped the real mail order bride overboard  en route.  If you've never seen Belmondo you should since he was a  sensation in his prime, something like a French Marlon Brando.",967248000,12,1346,4.845132743362832
441975,3,6302180201,"I got this film because Francois Truffaut directed it and Catherine Deneuve stars in it.  This film is OK, and Miss Deneuve does very good work in every film she is in- but it is still just a OK film.  I cannot recommend it too highly, but it is a pleasent way to spend a couple oh hours.",1357689600,2,288,3.9482758620689653
441976,5,6302180201,Any movie with Catherine Deneuve and Jean Paul Belmondo has to have a 5 star...and this one is no different.  They make such a sexy couple together...the plot is exciting...and love abounds between the two stars.  Romeo and Juliet...yes...but a little older...and sexier.  I enjoyed this movie a whole lot...highly recommended!,1354147200,,327,5.372549019607843
441977,4,6302180201,"A mystery film then a suspense film about a marriage built on lies and deceit (even moreso than most). Develops gradually increasing tension throughout and comes to a satisfying conclusion. Not great Truffaut, but a perfectly good movie.",1325376000,2,237,5.2631578947368425
441978,3,6302180201,"I think Original Sin - the rip off is much, much better.  It stars Angeline and Antonia Banderes.  Catherine Denuve - or whatever - CD is a boring actress.  And I think she's like an ice zombie - and I don't think she's beautiful - though all the males I know disagree.  I think Angelina (who is not a zombie) and Antonia are so very much better in Original Sin.  My reommendation?  Get both and compare",1299456000,2,403,4.2368421052631575
441979,2,6302180201,"This movie has two things in its favor (thus, my two* rating): 1. Great outdoor scenery (on the seldom-photographed Indian Ocean island of Reunion); 2. The opportunity to see both its stars (Deneuve and Belmondo) in their prime and without their shirts.

  Otherwise, forget it.

  The 2000 remake entitled Original Sin is less talky, more suspenseful, cheaper in cost (at least on Amazon), has an American (as opposed to a French) ending, and also features topless (and bottomless) stars (Jolie and Banderas). The novella to which both movies owe their inspiration, Waltz into Darkness (by the same guy who wrote Rear Window), is better than either movie, and has the best ending (truly noir) of all.  All three versions require a definite suspension of disbelief.  As a couple other reviewers of one or the other of the movie versions asked: ""How could anybody (i.e., the Belmondo/Banderas character) be so dumb?""",1274659200,,915,5.053333333333334
441980,4,6302180201,"""Mississippi Mermaid"" (1969), is a French film, written and directed by famed director Francois Truffaut(&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Francois-Truffaut-s-Adventures-of-Antoine-Doinel-The-400-Blows-Antoine-Collette-Stolen-Kisses-Bed-Board-Love-on-the-Run-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00008H2GR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Francois Truffaut's Adventures of Antoine Doinel (The 400 Blows / Antoine & Collette / Stolen Kisses / Bed & Board / Love on the Run) - Criterion Collection</a>).  It is an odd little noir melodrama, a crime/drama/romance, said to have been influenced by the famous British-American film director Alfred Hitchcock, that has the privilege of presenting two of the greatest stars of contemporary French cinema, Jean Paul Belmondo (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breathless-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000TXNDUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breathless - Criterion Collection</a>) and Catherine Deneuve(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Umbrellas-of-Cherbourg/dp/B0001BMLUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Umbrellas of Cherbourg</a>;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Belle-de-Jour/dp/B00005JKP9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Belle de Jour</a>) in its leading roles.  It is based on the novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Waltz-into-Darkness-Crime-Penguin/dp/0140239731/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Waltz into Darkness (Crime, Penguin)</a>&nbsp;by well-known American mystery/thriller author Cornell Woolrich, writing as William Irish, and was dedicated to famed French film director Jean Renoir.  It's not considered one of Truffaut's greatest pictures, but it has its moments.

The picture is set in the little-known French island of Reunion, near Madagascar, off Africa. Belmondo, who looks very uncomfortable in suit and tie, plays Louis Mahe, a sweet but slightly nave, successful businessman who owns tobacco fields and a cigar factory.  He is awaiting, when the picture opens, Julie Roussel as a mail order bride, whom he knows only from her letters.  When she arrives, aboard the ship ""Mississippi Mermaid,"" she arrives in the person of the stunning Deneuve, and is much more beautiful, and quite different, than he expected.  His life thereafter will take quite a few unexpected turns, most of them for the worst.

""Mississippi Mermaid"" gives us perhaps the best look we will ever get at the island of Reunion.  We also get to see some of southern France, the Riviera, Paris, and snowbound Switzerland.  It is a treat to look at the two stars in their gorgeous young primes, and their acting, as well as that of the rest of the cast, is quite acceptable.  Deneuve was less cold, and more sexy, certainly more skanky, than her usual persona. Belmondo, once freed of his earlier Reunion-bound persona, is able to loosen up and inhabit the emotions his character develops, as the pair develop a reality-based relationship.  Not the greatest French movie by a long shot, more a footnote curiosity, but worth seeing for fans of director or stars.",1263945600,5,3158,7.089974293059126
441981,3,6302180201,"A previous reviewer wrote that this movie is a ""beautiful failure"".  That assessment may be a bit harsh, although ""Mississippi Mermaid"" has its' faults. On the positive side, MM features solid chemistry `twixt Mr. Belmondo and Ms. Deneuve. There is some wonderful scenery from Reunion Island and parts of France.  Viewer interest is maintained throughout-few will be bored.  Yet, the negatives outweigh:  Credibility is cheerfully tossed aside.  Some egregious (!) ""loose ends"" are never tied together.  Two very serious crimes take place on camera, one murder and one embezzlement.  A second murder occurs off camera as a young woman is allegedly thrown overboard from an ocean liner! And then there is a vengeful, justice-seeking sister of the poor girl who alledgedly was deep sixed, hiring 50 per cent of a world-wise, smarmy private eye. Are any culprits brought to justice?  With those nefarious subplots, MM almost works.  This review will end here so as not to divulge any resolutions. This observer was unfamiliar with the work of the two leading stars. One suspects MM is not the best introduction to either. Questions and all, MM is still recommended, with the foregoing warning, to the intrepid movie lover.",1251763200,,1219,5.147208121827411

441984,4,6302180201,"I have not seen the DVD. I saw the classic Mermaid on its initial run in the theatres, and the impression continues to haunt me 30 years later.  I attribute the impact almost entirely to Mlle Deneuve's diabolical portrait of an utterly lost soul. Of her massive cannon of femme noir performances (spanning nearly half a century), her brilliant, ongoing exhibition of the dark side of the ""eternal feminine"", none is quite as disturbing, as that of the icily vapid Julie, the heartless, mindless, psychotic and inevitably homocidal/suicidal 'substitute' mail order bride.
In the Mermaid, which followed Belle de Jour and Repulsion in forming the foundation of Deneuve's introduction to an international audience (she'd been making films in France since the tender age of 13), Deneuve's character approaches the sub-human, becomming a sort of cosmic ""black-hole"" into which her victims (male) are helplessly drawn in a haze romantic self-asserting ignorance, an archeology of a long-lost maenidic fury, or prehensile feminist epistemology, which, under the mature Truffaut's direction and Deneuve's characteristic restraint is played out in grave measures, a ponderous, agonizing, inexorable procession through a slough of despair to dissolution.  If Mlle Deneuve et al. have succeeded in creating a character ""rotton to her xx chromosone core"", they have imparted something crucial about our humanity or lack thereof.  For this reason, I rate the Mermaid not as merely good, but great, albeit uncomfortably great, which is  perhaps why, it has always been consigned by critics to that dubious category of ""flawed masterpieces"".  But it's worth the price, if for nothing more than to see Deneuve as a flaming redhead.",1076112000,4,1715,5.384328358208955

At the beginning he's a rich planter on a glamorous tropical island and at the end he's a flat-broke pariah on the lam for a murder he did indeed commit.
