7340926,4,B011QAHFHS,"It is very interesting to see Otto Klemperer conducting the Choral Symphony, and to see his orchestra playing, and to hear his vocalists, including the great bass-baritone Gustav Neidlinger (PeaceBeUponHim).  There are only two flaws in this video presentation: first of all, the sound is staggered from the visual track--you hear the beginning of each note almost a full second after you see the singer start to sing or the violinist begin his stroke, which is disorienting and off-putting; secondly, soprano Agnes Giebel has a harsh, shrill, tinny, unlovely sound.  She's one of my least favorite opera singers.",1437177600,,613,5.244897959183674
7340927,5,B011QAHFHS,"I found this video in a used music store a while back and its one of those rare black pearls one cherishes with joyful exuberance!

From Oct. 27 1964 this is the only time Klemperer allowed a crew to film him in performance in order to be televised...and what performance it is!  Beethoven's 9th with the New Philharmonia featuring Giebel, Hoeffgen, Haefliger and Neidlinger along with Wilhelm Pitz's New Philharmonia Chorus give a performance that echos into eternity!

I just hope EMI decides to release this on DVD for all to cherish.

There is in fact a video biography on Klemperer on VHS and DVD called ""Otto Klemperer, A Journey through his Times"".  It is really something else, and I highly recommend it.  I found it miraculously by searching various web sites, and if you're a serious Klemp fan...you can find it too!  It's so worth it!",1098403200,2,845,4.707482993197279

8724903,5,B011QAHFHS,"This is a wonderful production of one of my favorite Bejart ballets. It hosts a an international cast of musical and dance talents, which is in touch with the humanitarian message of Beethoven's ""Ninth Symphony"". It is an ""Ode to Joy"" and wish for the fellowship of man.",1519862400,,270,4.645833333333333
8724904,5,B011QAHFHS,"Nothing can top the 9th.  Little can come close.  But this genuinely engaging ballet works very well with Beethoven.  The spirit is there.  The energy, the spectacle.  And it most definitely conveys the triumphant nature of the music.  As always, words don't suffice.  But try this out the next time you want to be lifted up by the 9th.  This will raise you a bit higher.",1489622400,,371,4.515151515151516

8724907,5,B011QAHFHS,"This work was first created and performed in 1964 and has since been a popular work performed by many ballet companies. This 2014 performance is excellent and really does this great justice. It is a magnificent choreographic work utilizing a large ensemble. It consists of many solos, pas de deux, pas de quatre, etc., mostly supported by the ensemble in the background. The technique is mostly classical ballet with plenty of modernisms(the dancing is done in ballet slippers, barefoot, and on pointe). The first movement is pretty much symbolic with very classical steps. The second movement is very lively with some novel and fun movements. The third movement is very romantic and lyrical. The last movement is very varied with lots of solos. All the choreography is very well suited to the music. It is hard to imagine steps that would be more musical. You almost get the sensation of ""hearing"" the choreography! The quality of the dancing and musical performance is outstanding. This is first and foremost an abstract ballet but it is hard not to form story concepts when viewing this. But Bejart assures us that his intention was to make this purely as an abstract ballet(his comments on this are included in the accompanying booklet). It is good to see Zubin Mehta again. This is a new performance of a modern ballet classic that should appeal to all lovers of ballet.",1458950400,2,1375,4.880341880341881

8724909,5,B011QAHFHS,"I don't care what critics have said about it or the responses of other viewers: I love this dance and completely embrace it. Usually I am alert and attentive to critics and other viewers because art is a communal experience. But from  the first moments of this performance I was drawn fully and deeply into its gestures and movements. Bejart's choreography does not over-interpret the music; he knows we know our Beethoven and are attuned to its nobility of message and performance. He builds on that; and what he builds with his Asian and Western dancers will be a joy forever. The sister city of my hometown St. Paul MN is Nagasaki Japan. A local artist designed a labyrinth overlooking a lake and called it Global Harmony. I walk that labyrinth several times a month, and repeated viewings of Bejart's dance fill me with the same calm and fulfillment.
The program opens with some elemental drumming while a former dancer recites Nietzsche's words with eloquence. At the end Zubin Mehta leaves the podium, walks to the center of the stage and places his folded hands to his forehead. According to Joseph Campbell, that Hindu gesture means, I greet the divinity within you. The evening is filled with such splendid moments.",1456617600,6,1224,4.828571428571428
8724910,5,B011QAHFHS,"Maurice Bjart (1927-2007) is well known for his enthralling staging of almost 250 dance works and more than 40 complete ballets, including the Rite of Spring (1959), Ravels Bolero (1961), and The Nutcracker (1998). Many of his works are not yet available on video and remain unknown, as it is his attractive Ring Around the Ring, which includes a variety of sequences presenting Wagnerian and contemporary characters (1990).  Less known by the American public is his fascinating rendition of Beethovens Ninth Symphony, which he created in 1964 for The Ballet of the 20th Century at the Thtre de la Monnaie in Brussels, the dance company he created in 1960. He was convinced that ballet could become as popular as cinema in the 20th century.  Bejarts father was the famous and controversial French philosopher Gaston Berger, who introduced him to the classics.
At present, unfortunately, in addition to the present video, there are only few other Bejarts pearls, The Nutcracker (Theatre Musical de Paris-Chatelet, 2000), and Bejart! Did you say Bejart? (a profile made in 2005). Some excerpts of his Bolero were included in Claude Lelouchs movie Les Uns et les Autres (1981, called Bolero in the US market). The Art of the 20th-Century Ballet is a collectors item in VHS and Lasser video (which includes Ravels Bolero and Mahlers Adagietto from the 5th Symphony, and other parts of the 3rd Symphony, performed by Jorge Donn).
His productions have been received around the world with great success, although derided in the US, where Arlene Croce (The New Yorker) dismissed him as a choreographer and called him Beige Art a purveyor of sensation.  Bejart was associated with many leading dancers who admired his talent, including Mikhail Baryshnikov, Suzanne Farrel and Maya Plisetskaya.  A constant traveller, he was always exploring the enormous diversity of artistic expressions and tried to incorporate them in his productions.
Bejart shared the Greek idea that a work of art should involve all the senses, idea that was championed by Richard Wagner in his concept, Gesamtkunstwerk or the total work of art, where staging plays a central role. The present rendition of Beethovens Choral Symphony is an excellent example. Gil Roman, a member of Bejarts company for more than 35 years, and currently the Artistic Director of the Bejart Ballet Lausannne, spent three years to remake the work, trying to be faithful to the original renditions (Brussels 1964 and La Scala 1973). Romans result is a combination of forces; the first movement is performed by the Tokyo Ballet, the second and third movements by the Lausanne team, and the two ensembles, together with a group of African dancers, are in charge of the apotheosis of the final movement. The vocal part is fairly executed by a group of acceptable soloists, and the monumental Ritsuyukai Choir (around 140 singers). The Israel Philharmonic Orchestra brings a crisp rendition under the overall musical direction of the experienced conductor Zubin Metha. The performance was filmed in 2014, in the majestic NHK Hall in Tokyo, which has a seating capacity of 3,800. The recording is outstanding, with all the advantages that Blu-Ray can offer today.
It is interesting to see the incorporation of different dancing expressions in each one of the four movements. And this trait is most observable in the fourth movement, where the dancers add their views to the words of Schillers Ode to Joy. The entire performance can be perceived as an anticipation to the middle of the last movement (1:05:20), where, after a long orchestral interlude, the chorus comes, with all its forces, singing Joy, bright spark of Divinity, daughter of Elysium, ..  the magic power re-unites all that custom has divided. All men become brothers under the sway of thy gentle wings. The group of 39 dancers, belonging to 15 different countries, march, hand in hand in a robust march for peace, joy and brotherhood.",1454198400,5,3938,5.089783281733746
