8482966,5,B005Q6KYPY,"Great film.  Very controversial for its time and and now as well.  Music, acting everything about this film is superb.
I have the VHS and had a DVD that I found at a flea market.  Unfortunately DVD got stolen. Looking to buy another one.
Yes, this film is that good and certainly worthy of any cinephile's collection.",1494028800,,317,4.526315789473684
8482967,4,B005Q6KYPY,"Thanks to my DVD player being a multi-region type, I was able to finally see (with English subtitles)
this film. Released years ago on a VHS tape under the title ""The Flavor of Corn""
it was only available on out of print used VHS tapes selling at inflated prices. This
film touches on a subject controversial to many.  The idea of an underage boy
increasingly attracted to his young 20-something male teacher.  Don't worry friends,
there is nothing offensive on screen. I don't think that the idea of the younger person
being the pursuer could be called pedophilia, unless it is supposed to be that if the
persued responds in kind. No spoilers here, except to say that I think this is well-handled
here. See it for yourself, please.

One more comment:  Why is this DVD called ""The Taste of Wheat""  when the film
itself still bears the title ""The Flavor of Corn"" ?",1373414400,,863,4.577922077922078
8482968,4,B005Q6KYPY,"While many films explore gay youth coming of age, none do so in the manner captured in ""il sapore del grano"" (also known as The Flavor of Corn and/or The Taste of Wheat).  This mid 1980's Italian film tells the touching story of a young boy Duilio and his intense (and somewhat coveted, even jealous affection) towards his young male teacher Lorenzo.  The film takes many interesting directions, but the primary focus is the intersection of life between Lorenzo and Duilio.

Remarkably tasteful, the main characters (along with those of the family) are rather well developed.  Keep in mind, the film is in Italian, so my entire viewing is based on reading subtitles.  Most of the story takes place at either Duilio's family home and farm, or at Lorenzo's apartment.  I have little experience with Italian films, so I cannot pass judgement on the acting or directing, but the film held my attention from start to finish.

The initial relationship appears to be a common one where a compassionate teacher reaches out to a quiet student seeking attention. I imagine this scenario occurs often between educators and students.  The difference here is the story is based in a small Italian village, and the relationship is quite personal.  By today's standards in America, there's not a chance this ""friendship"" would be acceptable.  Lorenzo visits the family home often, dining with the family and developing a close bond with Duilio.  When not with the family, Lorenzo has a sexual affair with a woman apparently engaged to be married.  It appears Lorenzo wants a partner in life, and the woman has no interest.  My observation is Lorenzo starts making a comparison between this woman unable to commit / show affection towards Lorenzo and Duilio, who desires to see Lorenzo daily, even making him gifts. This is by far a complicated twist on the story.  One might simply see a compassionate caring teacher offering guidance and support to a youth.  Others will see a darker meaning.

As the story progresses, Duilio (for lack of better terms) makes a move on Lorenzo. At this point, most would agree it was Lorenzo's responsibility to resist. The scene is brief, clean, and free of anything ""sexual"".  But it no doubt creates the controversy for which the film is based.  At no point do we delve into sexuality of the characters, but the viewer is left to make their own assumptions.

The ending is bitter-sweet. Lorenzo agonizes his confusion, and his passion for what Duilio represents, or is it more? Lorenzo makes a decision in the best interest of his potential career as a teacher, and quite possibly to protect Duilio.  In doing so, is either person better off?  You'll be left wondering exactly what thoughts are ravaging through the minds of Duilio and Lorenzo as the film comes to an end.

As I started watching, I was reminded of another controversial film (from 2000) on the same topic, only much more explicit,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eban-and-Charley/dp/B000067J4I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eban and Charley</a>. In both films, it is the younger person pursuing the older one.  In the end, they are both about the sometimes painful experience of coming of age or coming to terms with identifying sexuality. For these reasons alone, it's why we as a nation must learn to accept and support young people regardless of sexuality.",1362182400,,3388,5.064864864864865
