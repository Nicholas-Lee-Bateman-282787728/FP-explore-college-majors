8410472,5,B003ZJJ9CI,I loved this DVD. I used it when pregnant with all three of my kids. It leaves you feeling great physically and about being a mother to be. It really helped me get my body ready for labor and stay in shape.,1472774400,,206,3.9285714285714284
8410473,4,B003ZJJ9CI,"I love it. I'm in my first trimester with our third kid. I've done P90X yoga but it's been several months, and with morning sickness and bloating I was feeling gross and unhealthy. This is the perfect amount of work for a pregnancy workout, and it feels like I'm working muscles that will help me through the rest of pregnancy and in delivery.",1375142400,,343,4.4603174603174605
8410474,4,B003ZJJ9CI,The stretches that she does have worked wonders for my sciatica. I started when I was 20 weeks pregnant; I do it daily right before I go to sleep. The video is lengthy and even I wish it was quicker between transitions but as she states at the beginning: this video is for every tri-mester. I can only manage to do the first 30 min at night because it seems like forever but the stretches really work! I could not imagine my life without the stretches.,1314748800,2,452,4.267441860465116
8410475,2,B003ZJJ9CI,"There's a reason this DVD is so low-priced... it's not exceptionally easy to follow and it isn't that fun. I've done the main exersize on the video 3 times now only because I'm desparate to stay in shape during my pregnancy. Until I find a replacement I can do from the living room... I'll keep it.

This is my first time being pregnant and doing this video was my first attempt at following a yoga/pilates instructor. I'm more into running, hiking, soccer, racquetball, etc... pretty much a lot of things that I either can't do or must be careful with now that I'm expecting. I bring this up is because I have nothing to reference the calibur of the instructor. Perhaps someone who is used to following a yoga/pilates instructor would have something different to say.",1308009600,,768,4.647058823529412
