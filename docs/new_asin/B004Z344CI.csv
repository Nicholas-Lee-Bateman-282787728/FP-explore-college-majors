8519046,1,B004Z344CI,"I was so exited to finally find Danielle Steel's ""The Ring"" & ""Star"", on a disk with 17 more movies...I ordered it and at the same time, I ordered a Multi-Region DVD player, so (as advertised), it would play the movie for our region. (USA).  Well, the voice is not in sync with the people speaking and it is one of the most annoying things I've ever seen, also, the Dutch subtitles will not go off when you push the off button (they just stay on to make this even more aggravating) and there are 3-4 movies on each disk giving this very poor picture quality as well as maybe causing the voice to be off...I was told by a few electronics professionals, that this is do to the dvd not being manufactured properly (most likely one of a bad batch of dvds).  I have spent so much time on line, on the phone and in stores, not to mention, in front of the new multi region dvd player, just trying to make this work.  It is obvious that this is why this product seems to be somewhat inexpensive...it doesn't work and they burned all these dvds just to sell them for over 100.00 to take advantage of people like us.  (telling us it would work on a multi region dvd player).  WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY...I TRIED TO CONTACT THEM,THE MESSAGE SAID THEY'RE ONLY OPEN MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY FROM 10-2. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO REACH THEM FOR DAYS AND NO ONE ANSWERS THE PHONE!  Now I have to go through the trouble and expense of sending back the m.r. dvd player and the dvds.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Danielle-Steel-Collection-19-Films-6-DVD-Box-Set-Danielle-Steel-s-Changes-Danielle-Steel-s-Vanished-Danielle-Steel-s-Palomino-Danielle-Steel-s-A-Perfect-Stranger-Dani-NON-USA-FORMAT-PAL-Reg-2-Import-Netherlands/dp/B004Z344CI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Danielle Steel Collection (19 Films) - 6-DVD Box Set ( Danielle Steel's Changes / Danielle Steel's Vanished / Danielle Steel's Palomino / Danielle Steel's A Perfect Stranger / Dani [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 2 Import - Netherlands </a>]",1374883200,15,2019,5.333333333333333
