1170921,4,8373615768,We started watching this movie in my french class last year and we begged the teacher to let us watch it every day! I ended up buying it for my friend for her birthday and she loved it! The movie is hilarious to many people but it depends on personal prefernce.,1102118400,5,261,4.137254901960785
1170922,1,8373615768,"I can't believe I have to give it at least one star. There should be an option for no stars. I am a high school student who had to watch this terrible movie in my French class. Please save your students the pain of watching this!! I would have much rather done grammer exercises or translated sentences. I can't understand how the other people who wrote reviews could think it was hysterically funny. I didn't laugh once because it was so dumb. I DO NOT enjoy seeing animals being kicked or abandoned. I was bored out of my mind watching this movie. It was all I could to keep awake. After watching this, I can understand why the French watch dubbed American movies.",1014595200,5,666,4.4227642276422765
1170923,5,8373615768,"I saw this in a film festival years ago. I was in a lot of pain from laughing so much.
I tell all my friends about this movie but no one went to see it. Too bad. They are missing out big time...",945388800,7,194,3.5348837209302326
1170924,5,8373615768,"Fantastic approach of a certain third age spirit, just being capable but not willing to participate in others projects.  The need of care, the need of attention, the need to believe she is still in control and can control  others. Great Film! Fantastic actors.",944524800,8,260,4.886363636363637
1170925,4,8373615768,"I had been waiting to get a US format DVD of this hilarious movie,
one of my favorites. Unfortunately this version didnot have subtitles.",1401926400,,137,4.75
1170926,4,8373615768,"I finally bought a universal DVD player.  I'm not a whiz at these things, so I still don't know how to get things set up that aren't in the usual ""settings"" places.  This film was re-formatted ""to fit your screen"", but I'm not sure what screen they had in mind---it's certainly not a modern flat screen.  People are flat topped, and walk out of scenes while still in the same room.  It's not quite as bad as ""Sunset Boulevard"" where everyone is stretched sideways and looks like they're on the Wicked Witch's TV screen, but it's not a good adaptation.

The movie, on the other hand, is as good as I remember it.  Too bad we can't get a good modern US copy.  Subtitles are white but well placed and readable.  The French translation seems to be a bit better also---I remember the dog Gardez Vous being translated on VHS as ""Onyourmark"", here his name is more close to the original intent.  Tatie Danielle is as nasty and as selfish as ever.  Her Parisian nephew and family are perfect if baffled foils for her miserable behavior, until they go away on vacation and leave her with a woman every bit as selfish as she is.

For folks who like foreign films, and comedies, this one holds up well.",1391472000,,1191,4.41743119266055
1170927,5,8373615768,Have seen this movie when I was a child and impressed me so much. Very good movie that shows reality of life. Thanks,1388448000,,116,4.086956521739131
1170928,5,8373615768,"I'm not even sure I can objectively rate this movie. In fact, I not even going to try. It kind of has a NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION meets VERY BAD THINGS vibe. (end of review) I'm giving this 5 stars because I laughed so hard, yes. Because it's well put together, yes. Because the actors all play their parts perfectly, sure. But let's be honest; I gave this 5 stars because the central character IS my grandmother to a T. Sad to say, but I couldn't possibly be more serious! Someone who will cuss you out, and try to hit you, but then scream at the top of their lungs if you even suggest something they don't like. Someone who's only joy in life is manipulating people into currying her favor. Someone who can cause other people to practically come to blows with one another because they're sick to their eye-teeth of dealing with her but can't take it out on her. A person who's only happy making others miserable, accosting strangers with rude comments, embarrassing anyone within eye shot and blaming others for the precisely devious deeds she has committed herself. Yeah. I still had mild stereotypically generalized 'American' reservation about France and it's people, until I saw this film. Any country that has the guts to put this film out and give 3 of it's actresses Csar Awards has a clean slate in my book. Any country where the authorities would actually understand the situation, instead of laming out makes me want to move there. Heck, I might just go visit and let them abuse me for a while. I now realize, they couldn't say or do anything to me that hasn't already been done by my own blood. And I now notice this is hardly a film review... as much as a purging of emotion. I can't imagine this movie would be for anyone but the 'lucky' few (and maybe those with a healthy sense of humor), but for those who understand it could be a revelation. You're not alone.  VIVE LA FRANCE!!",1363219200,,1898,4.501449275362319
1170929,4,8373615768,"This is the character you NEVER want to have in your own family tree but we can all relate to certain aspects of her personality as she represents ALL that you detest.  ""Sandrine"" is a perfect character to sort of ""tame"" the obnoxious ""Tatie Danielle"".  Great fun but I always feel sorry for the little cocker spaniel!",1361232000,,318,4.56140350877193
1170930,5,8373615768,this is a hilarious film. I have no idea why it was never put out region 1.. I think it would take off and make a lot of $$ for someone.. this mean b_tch will have you in hysterics!!,1356652800,,182,3.6923076923076925
1170931,2,8373615768,"I feel sorry for the nice family of Tatie E, the victims of the nasty aunt; and i feel sorry for the dog that gets abandoned, and i feel sorry for myself for watching this questionable dark comedy.",1330473600,,197,4.2105263157894735
1170932,5,8373615768,a must see! Truly one of the best movies I've ever seen!  If this was on DVD I would own it.,1292198400,,92,3.380952380952381
1170933,5,8373615768,"At last! I saw this movie twenty years ago and have been periodically searching Netflix for it. When you were able to suggest movies to Netflix I wrote them and begged that they get it  but it was not available on dvd. I just decided to check today, it's still not available on Netlix, but when I googled it I was so happy to discover that it's on dvd and available to purchase. I don't want to give away the movie but it's a wonderfully dark comedy.",1291075200,2,450,4.172413793103448
1170934,5,8373615768,Absolutely loved this movie!!  I'm just sorry they haven't put this on a cd (in good quality).  I hate ruining movies or books by saying too much about them other than whether I like them or not.  This one I love!!,1266969600,,214,4.170731707317073
1170936,4,8373615768,This is one of the greatest foreign films around. It's a dark comedy with a typically French Flair. We first saw this film on the Sundance Channel and decided we had to own it. Finding a DVD of it in America is impossible so we purchased the used VHS version at Amazon and converted it to a DVD. If you can deal with subtitles.......you will love this film.,1258588800,2,357,4.264705882352941
1170937,5,8373615768,"My brother and I watched this film in horror, about 20 years ago...  With the impending thoughts that this is what our mother would turn into someday.  Thankfully, 20 years later?  We have things like oxycontin and xanix.  Ever wonder why people become addicted to their prescription meds and die?  It's because no one likes anyone who's mean. Really, it's better they have medication...

Tatie Danielle is manipulative, a trouble-maker.  She feigns to be dependent in her illness, sneaking and lurking around behind the scenes every chance she gets.  And she also gets a private charge out of hurting other people!  (This is what people do when they don't like themselves.)

The theme of this movie is psychological, satirical observation.  We get to witness Tatie, able to screw around, mess with people's heads, constantly hitting them under the belt and using her moods and financial leverage to control people's lives.  And people kow-tow to her...  Because she has a house, some money left from the death of her husband, and her pension.  She gets away with a lot of bad behavior just because she can! Casually watching her own house-sitter fall to her death, you can't help but wonder - what had Tatie's marriage been like?!  But that's just the beginning...  Surrounded by a quirky cast of characters, this film is funny and unnerving; sure to remind you of someone you know!",1237248000,7,1383,4.896551724137931
1170938,5,8373615768,"Hating everyone nearby, those caring after her especially, eighty two year old colonel's widow had sold a property, partitioned money between nieces and moved in to live with a younger one's family just to destroy family's apartment, bring a shame on this family and befriend an abusive carer short of everything but an urge on husband.

Lucky is a family of Parisians employed, looking after non-disabled physically person in France, where such a delusive cash-rich hug did not call police in, complain to a social worker or send any case manager to arrange a living hell for relatives in order to simplify transferring her possession to nursing home ""age care specialists"" she anyway had left for an abusive carer showered with expensive presents and, perhaps, with money on a trip to the Alps the producers ended in a story of untie Danielle.",1210982400,,845,4.950704225352113
1170939,5,8373615768,"This is one of my favorite movies ever.  Every character is deliciously crafted which adds to such a great mix of enjoyable interactions and fun.  Satire, warmth and folly are all blended nicely.  Everyone in the film, Tatie, the nephew, the wife, the sister-in-law, the kids, the care-giver, beauty-salon co-worker and nursing home staff are all favorites. Quite a gem indeed.  BRAVO!",1196380800,,385,5.161290322580645
1170940,5,8373615768,"I remembered this as being funny and hoping I lived to be an evil old bitch,

too, but watching it eight years later I don't feel the same way.  It's

tragic and makes me think I'd rather die an evil oldISH bitch.",1179100800,,213,4.023809523809524
1170941,5,8373615768,"From the very beginning you know this film is different. Granted, you don't know whether you should hate her or love her, Tatie Danielle will eventually become one of your favorite women of French Cinema. Yes, I may not know all that is said, considering the # of times I've seen this film - but yet I understand the character. You will laugh until you cry and, at the same time, sympathize with her - in spite of how cruel she may be to people around her. My only disappointment was that it had to end.",1159228800,10,503,4.25
1170942,5,8373615768,"""Tatie Danielle"" is a wickedly funny dark comedy.  Tatie Danielle pretends to be a needy geriatric, yet she upends the lives of well-meaning family members through her misanthropic plots.  Not someone I'd necessarily want to know, Tatie Danielle is a hoot to watch as she wreaks havoc on every Good Samaritan in her path.  Wish this were available on DVD for American audiences -- it's always hilarious no matter how many times I watch this.",1154131200,13,441,4.8533333333333335
1170943,4,8373615768,"Back in college I promoted a French film evening, and as such, raided the local foreign movie store on regular occasions.  I found this gem by accident (so to speak) and was thrilled to find an apporachable french comedy with wit and anguish--the ironic twists of an aged woman shut up by social norms who breaks norms as a way of breaking her enforced tedium, only to encounter further forms of social constraint, and comes of age in her octegenarian vitality.  Long winded yes, but folks, it is french film after all, and it takes the slapstick of a dumb and dumber variety and infuses the existentialist statism so dear to all of us yanks.

The acting is superb, and the characters are bright and invigorated.",1149033600,6,712,4.634920634920635

1170945,5,8373615768,"This is not a movie for the underaged or those insensitive to subtleties.  It is French cinema at its best, couldn't have been made here.  We are so programmed to think of old people as being nice, it's so refreshing to see a mean old b-tch who hates and uses her family.  However, what goes around, comes around, and she indeed has her eyes opened by a beautiful young caregiver.  I've had 2 copies of this for many years; people either loved it (as do I) or hated it.  It is a different type of humor than the simple-minded comedies to which we are accustomed in America, a more visual comedy.  I just wish it would come out in DVD!",1109462400,18,634,4.241666666666666
