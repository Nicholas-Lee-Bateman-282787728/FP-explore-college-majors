402450,4,6301977491,"I watch this film in the year 2005, and I am amazed.  Amazed at the kind of health care that can be taken for granted, and, on an adolescent-like  indulgent whim, petitioned for destruction. I think back of my uncle two years ago who couldn't die fast enough-to free up his hospital bed-from a DNR [without the family's consent BTW-which is exactly how euthanasia is consisitently proceeding in this country.] induced coma caused by a botched surgery, and I can't imagine a time where a chief of staff wanted a patient to inconveniently and expensively live, rather than be shuffled off to die!  But most of all I am amazed that this burgeoning story of a futilitarianism future generations are perhaps permanently sacrificed to is again and again presented as revolutionary and heroic and ""progressive.""  In films, why can't we see disabled people who fight to live against the resentful staffs who oblige and mentally pulverize them into throwing themselves away?  Why isn't a family or siginficant other who sacrifices to be there for someone and really love them positive, lauded and supported in any sense any more?  What about the natural self-esteem and appreciation of letting others take care of you sometimes necessary rather than a cause for a utilitarian guilt trip?  (We are all dependent and deprived of privacy at times-something the film in it's utilitarian and macho body prejudice won't consider.) These are the real stories that agonize to be told-just one cinematic expression would be nice!",1113696000,,1511,5.02
402451,3,6301977491,"This film could have been great, except for some serious scripting and characterization problems.  Many of the characters are stereotypical, wafer-thin portrayals, particularly the head doctor who wants to keep Dreyfuss's character alive.  The ""party scene in the hospital basement"" is not only cliched, but nobody got fired or got in trouble (the Jamaican nurse in particular) for smoking dope in a hospital, and taking a quadraplegic patient out of their bed without permission in the middle of the night?  Give me a break!
Finally, Dreyfuss's decision to ""remain in the hospital to die"" at the end... the judge's ruling was specifically that he be released (writ of Habeus Corpus), not that he be allowed to die without treatment in the hospital!
These serious problems (particularly the latter, where he decides to stay in the hospital) just about ruined the film for me.  Never mind that there's never much of a real sense of suspense or genuine emotion here, and everything plays far too liberally off (melo)drama generated by the Dreyfuss character's decision.  I'll give it 3 stars, and I feel like I'm being generous.  Comes dangerously close to trivializing the issues portrayed in the film, and occasionally crosses the line... if it weren't for much more honest films with subject matter just as difficult (like ""Dead Man Walking"") I might be more forgiving and just chalk it up to the best Hollywood can do with this sort of material, but I know better.",1076630400,3,1466,4.987704918032787
402452,5,6301977491,"I actually studied the play Whose Life is it Anyway? for a drama assignment at school. The movie really did justice to the original story by Brian Clark. Even though I was encouraged to do a different play, as this one is so hard to find information on, I stuck with this one because I loved it so much. The story really moved me, and I found myself crying at more than one point during the movie. This story brings up so many issues that are relevant to all humans... I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good story!",990316800,4,523,4.188118811881188
402453,5,6301977491,"This movie was excellent!!!!! I taped it years ago when it was on cable and I still take it out and watch it!!!!  Richard Dreyfuss protrays a successful artist that has it all.  Then, in a near fatal car crash becomes a quadrapalegic.  His hope of ever walking, using his arms, creating art or having an intimate relationship with his girlfriend dimishes.  While life goes on for everyone else, time for him stands still.  He then makes a crucial decision and is caught up in the legal battle of his life.
While it is heartbreaking to watch this happen to any human being, Richard Dreyfuss does an excellent job portraying the emotional and physical battle that ensues this poor soul.

The cast in this film is so  strong, they will bring you in and turn you everyway but loose. The story  of a man who had his life in his creations and sharing them with people  that were close to him, then in a flash his future changes with a  devastating car crash that strips him of his ability to create, his  manhood, and the hardship of having to adjust and make decisions about the  rest of his life. The interaction with the rest of the cast pulls this film  together to create a true heart string pull that will stay with you  forever. Dont miss this film!",946512000,4,757,4.244755244755245
402455,3,6301977491,"They don't make them like this anymore, folks.  See, there is a reason to rejoice!  Richard Dreyfuss as a quadriplegiac, unable to move from his hospital bed whilst whining and crying, preaching and pontificating,  thinking he is without a doubt putting in the performance of a lifetime.  Holy crump!  What was this guy thinking (or snorting, for that matter)?  However, this is not a film to be dismissed entirely, thanks to a solid  John Cassavetes who provides a perfect counterbalance as the doctor intent  upon saving the life of the malcontent, suicidal vegetable.  Pay special  attention to the scene when Cassavetes, the venerable warhorse, puts an  uppity med student in his place and gives him an off-the-cuff lecture on  the importance of the preservation of human life at any and all  cost(particularly the bit about the allotted three score and ten). As  Foghorn Leghorn would say, the message is ""about as subtle as a hand  grenade in a sack of oatmeal.""  Save this one for a rainy afternoon  when your spirits aren't too high to begin with.  But save it regardless.",928972800,6,1080,4.87292817679558

This is one of the better performances I've seen of Richard Dreyfuss.  I gave this four stars because it is not as good as an Indian movie I've seen that treated the ""torture"" of being unable to do things for yourself in a more vivid way. In this film the frustration has to be expressed verbally rather than more visually as in the Indian film.

Movie was done at a time when a persons right to die was just starting to be questioned.  Don't want to give away to much of the story but he is badly injured in a car accident which leaves him totally paralized. Because of his injuries he wants to be allowed to die in peace. Makes you think is he right in what he wants to do and  what would I do if I was in the same boat as this person.  Good acting  and story all the way around.

Appalled at the prospect of a life in which he has no control of anything, he pleads with hospital authorities to help him die. When they refuse, he takes them to court.

402694,5,6301977491,"The first time I saw this movie back in 1982 I cried.  Watching it again, after all these years, still touches me deeply.  There's a powerful message in this film, and the actors, script-writers, and director do it justice.

Ken Harrison is an artist, a sculptor, successful in his field and living with his beautiful girlfriend, when his life is changed forever by a horrible car accident.  While his life was saved, Ken becomes a quadriplegic.  Only able to move his shoulders and head, Ken feels helplessly out of control of his own life.  His life, he says, was all in his hands, not in his head.

Six months later, as his existence is truly sinking into reality and Ken has recognized his condition is not something that will magically disappear one day, he tells his girlfriend to stop coming to the hospital and that its completely over between them.  He also tells the hospital to stop their treatment, he's decided that his life should end.  In an extremely powerful and poignant scene, Ken has refused the valium his doctor ordered for him, because the doctor felt he was too ""riled up"".  The doctor injects him anyway, as Ken helplessly watches.  ""How dare you inject that into my body without my permission?"" he asks.  And I wondered, how dare he?  It's a significant moment, imagine yourself as Ken impotently watching as someone does something to your very own body against your wishes.

Ken hires a lawyer, and sues the hospital for ""Habeas Corpus"" (literally, ""give us the body"").  No matter what his requests for release from the hospital and cessation of treatment, including daily dialysis, Dr. Michael Emerson (John Cassavetes) ignores them.  Ken wants his treatment to stop so that he can die.  Despite his desire to end his life, Ken is amiable with the staff.  His funny, quirky personality has made him a favorite with the nurses and orderlies, and they are all saddened by his decision though they respect him enough to stand by him.

The question of human euthanasia is so controversial, especially after Dr. Kevorkian brought the subject out into the direct sunlight.  The movie does a good job of portraying each side; Ken's personal decision to die and those around him who are morally and personally against it.  It's a very touching story, one that will make you shed at least a tiny tear, even if your not prone to them.  There's no sappiness or preaching getting in the way of the story.  The acting, specifically Richard Dreyfuss, is terrific.  It's a movie that stirs you emotionally, morally, and intellectually.  Don't miss out on this great movie.  Enjoy!",1232582400,,2593,4.796839729119639
402695,4,6301977491,"This is truly a great film with great performances at every level. Made during a time that seemed flush with ""dying boy"" melodramas, ""Whose Life Is it Anyway?"" remains engaging and relevant today.  The economy of the dialogue gets right to the point for all characters, the physicians with their ideals, the girl friend who must deal with the loss of the man she loves, and the artist who lost the essence of who he is. It's refreshing and moving to see a script that spares us the sentimentality that so many similar stories indulge in. This makes the scenes of humor and warmth such as Ken's interaction with a young dialysis patient all the more meaningful.

The film digs deep into issues that we're still talking about today such as the physician's role in caring for the terminally ill and the patient's right to autonomy.

Dreyfuss and Cassavetes deliver solid performances, and while Cassavetes is our hero's adversary, he is by no means a villain, so regardless of where you stand on the issue, you will find your position fairly represented.

Well worth moving to the top of your netflix queue today or even as a title to own.",1230681600,,1136,4.665

The performances by Richard Dreyfus, John Cassavetes, Christine Lahti and the rest of the cast are brilliant and flawless, the direction is amazing, the story is timeless, and most importantly, it is bouyed up by one of life's greatest lessons: the choices we make in this life are sacred, because they are ours alone to make, and nothing and no one trumps that!

402762,4,6301977491,"Ken Harrison (Richard Dreyfuss) is an artist... His fingers make things of beauty...

When he lived through a car accident that left him paralyzed from the neck down, we understood why he wanted to be left alone to die...

Ken moved from a world of life and creation, to an empty world where he can't move even a single finger...

Lying under the white sheets of the hospital bed, he is subjected to stress under the shock of his another reality... The artist has gone... The creator of an art expressed in all its different dimensions, round in relief, imagery, symbolism, all vanished in seconds...

But his human spirit remains alive under the severity, the compulsion, the threats of his new reality...

Ken was a cunning sculptor, skillful, ingenious in the use of his mind and hands... He is now charming, capable to seduce the whole nursing staff by pillow talk...

The movie deals with many hypothesis about the right to die...

Does a patient have the right to choose to die? Does he have the right to refuse life-sustaining medical treatment, even if that means certain immediate or accelerated death?

Doctor Emerson (John Cassavetes) wants to prolong the life of Ken... He wants him to live his disability as quadriplegic even feeling so down... For him, everybody has their own struggles in life...

Richard Dreyfuss is superb as Ken Harrison, a quick moving mind, true and clever, who displays unpleasant, troublesome reality... He relies on his intelligence and energy rather than his looks and charisma to win his fight, his right to die...

John Cassavetes i excellent in his role, intense as Dr. Emerson, the Chief of Staff... He plays the role with personality, ability and style dealing with the problem with absolute professionalism...

Christine Lahti (Dr. Clare Scott) is very appealing, too powerful, tempting and charming, tolerant and understanding, along with big heart... She is convincing, closer than most to truth or at least to the subjective reality of her patient...

The film is extraordinary compelling, unforgettable, frequently painful, yet intriguing!

What we learn about ethics and how to make decisions may be useful in this real world... The path taken really does transform the meaning...",1168905600,14,2232,5.032608695652174

402764,5,6301977491,"Needed to take an elective college class many years ago.  I chose the ""Death and Dying"" class.  This film was suggested viewing but not manditory.  After viewing this film, I was deeply moved and also troubled.  We discussed this film in great detail and the class was torn on which was the moral or ethical rights of the patient versus the hospital and the doctors who were treating the patient.  Needless to say, we all learned a great deal about ourselves and how we see life.  It is a real shame that this film is not out on DVD and it is a real shame that the film studio is not releasing this at a lower cost to the public.  I do own a VHS copy which has been played many times over.  This film still gives me pause for thought and reflection everytime I see it.  I ask that the viewing public petition the studio to release this on DVD.",1153267200,8,843,4.186335403726708

402767,5,6301977491,"Richard Dreyfuss plays a young man who is paralyzed in a car accident, but with his mind fully intact; he wants to be discharged from the hospital in order to die. His chief nemesis, of course, is his doctor, played by John Cassavetes. Dreyfuss is such an animated actor that not even being confined to a bed as quadriplegic can take that quality of acting away from him. Just in talking and using his brain he exudes more energy than most actors do in a screen performance.

He hires a lawyer to fight his case in court, and he wins. At movie's end he leaves the hospital, and we don't know how to feel: good because he got what he fought for or bad because he's going to die now. Some scenes go straight for the heartstrings, but most of the movie is thought-provoking and intelligently done. Dreyfuss is too good here to completely believe him when he says he can't remember making the movie because of his drug habit at the time. Deserves a DVD release, and soon.

402770,5,6301977491,"I've been waiting for this film to come out on DVD for quite some time, but would also settle for a more reasonable price on VHS.  I am a nurse who has worked for many years with trauma patients and while some Hollywood liberalities were evident, the film/story overall is not far off.  I read the other reviews and had difficulty determining if W. Dickinson were reviewing Whose Life Is It Anyway, or if he were reviewing his personal experience involving his uncle's tragic story.  I can assure him however, that I've worked closely with more than one Chief of Staff and MD who fought for life over the expense!  I can also think of a number of films that depicted the bravery and fight by the afflicted individual as well as the loved ones who supported him/her through it all.  This particular film focuses on a different aspect.....the right of the patient to make the decision rather than medical staff who can ""keep someone going"" or the loved ones who can't bear to give the individual up.  It's a tough one!",1120435200,6,1016,4.554945054945055
402771,3,6301977491,"I watched ""Whose Life is it Anyway"" because I read about it in an essay on disability in film. Paul K. Longmore argues that ""Whose Life"" disregards social stigma and discrimination on the part of the able-bodied world and instead casts the able-bodied as reluctant mercy killers.

I am not a quadriplegic, my disability is cerebral palsy. If I wanted to kill myself I feel sure I could find a way, and I am disabled from birth. That is a little bit different than someone who LOSES his or her bodily-abilities in terms of the shock of the loss. My life with disability is all I have known, and I would imagine it would be worse to have been suddenly thrust into disabled life.

Still, I wouldn't want to force anyone to live my life, or force them to live at all. It's not my choice, or society's at large; it's up to the person living that life. I do believe that the issues raised in ""Whose Life"" are distressing, and I believe that the arguments in favor of sustaining Dreyfuss's life are sound and sincere, as are his against the idea.

Should I be more concerned with the issue as a disabled American? I hope not, especially now when there are many more advances in independence for people with all levels of disability. And yet, there is that distant fear that the choice will someday be taken from us and given to someone else who deems our existence miserable. Just look at the writings of Peter Singer for proof. He literally believes that animals are more aware of life than a human infant at 30-days old, and that parents of disabled infants should be given those 30-days to decide whether or not to let that baby continue to live.

So, I suppose it IS a slippery slope, but as for the film itself, it is well made and worth a rent.",1116806400,2,1743,4.403726708074534
