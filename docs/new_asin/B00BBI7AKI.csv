5570314,5,B00BBI7AKI,i saw an ad on hulu for this show for awhile before i watched it . one word awesome !!! my only regret is that it only ran one season and not very many episodes even then. i heard viewers tried to get it picked up again and i did find a petition with about nine thousand signatures. i wish the powers that be would reconsider their decision cuz this was one of the best shows ive seen,1367884800,13,384,3.9358974358974357
5570315,2,B00BBI7AKI,"I love the show, which is why I ordered the dvds, but it was disappointing that the disks would not play at all in the dvd player on my computer or my older dvd player.  They do play in a newer Panasonic dvd player, so I guess it's not a total loss.",1364515200,9,249,3.7884615384615383
5570316,2,B00BBI7AKI,"If I were remotely as arrogant and perfect as the lead character, I would write this review: there are a couple of interesting episodes but it quickly becomes dull and predictable. And of course a bunch of stereotypes -- hispanic maids, Russian chess players, Asian women and white guy hitting it off, token Indian character (must admit this is a new phenomenon), etc. etc., good looking women hanging on to every word of the protagonist while he continues to be rude, uncaring (except in a paternalistic way) and on and on. Watch it if you have nothing better to do -- and that too may the first two episodes. It devolves quickly.",1530230400,2,631,4.642857142857143
5570317,1,B00BBI7AKI,"I saw one episode. The first episode. I forced myself to finish it. I would have stopped watching after the first 10 minutes... in fact I did stop, because it felt dated in a bad way, the acting was awful and the writing worse. But I forged on, not wanting to be hasty. And yet, at the end of the pilot episode I concluded th my instinct was correct. I dislike everything about this first episode: the homophobia, the unbelievable Russian accent, the main character's bad dye job, all the peripheral characters... maybe the show improved as it went on, but I will never know.",1529971200,3,575,4.485714285714286
5570318,5,B00BBI7AKI,I am so disappointed that there was only one season of this show. Who do I need to contact to see about doing another season at Endgame. It makes no sense that you had the cliffhanger at the end and there is no more episodes.,1529884800,3,225,4.022222222222222

5570320,5,B00BBI7AKI,A brilliant and touching murder mystery series.  Well acted with excellent writing.  The only disappointment is that there is only one season.,1529712000,,142,5.409090909090909

5570322,3,B00BBI7AKI,"When it came out in 2012, it was released at the heels of ""House"" coming to an end. There's a reason House was on for 8 years and won numerous awards, while this only lasted for 1 season. ENDGAME is a flaccid attempt to portray a curmudgeon genius who successfully helps others solve their issues while simultaneously trying to solve his own. With that said, sure, endgame can be a fun watch, if you have nothing else to binge on and you knowingly watch this without any real expectations. It's not a good production by any means but there's a light heartedness that enables you to get through it.

Conceptually this definitely has potential, if done right (I suppose you could say this about anything though). What I really would have liked to have seen is chess strategy deeply written into the plot while centering around the philosophies of chess. The writing did attempt to do this in a few of the episodes, but when it did, it was at best sporadic and superficial. It did not seem like the writers really knew or understood chess outside of juvenile fact finding attempts on wikipedia.",1529625600,,1091,4.623711340206185

5570324,1,B00BBI7AKI,"Where do I start? Idiotic scripts, ""Balagan's"" terrible Russian accent, hideous dye job (or is it a bad wig?), and a ""luxury"" hotel that looks like a middlin' airport limited-service deplorables' idea of luxury.

Shawn Doyle has been so good elsewhere; the last time I recall his work was as a character in Billions. Endgame must have been a cash grab. Period.

5570325,2,B00BBI7AKI,"the plots are childishly written. No one with an ounce of understanding of forensic science will write these nonsense. But all that aside, I like the main character. He is well plaid and keep it interesting. but not enough to waste any more time on these series. No wonder this was cancelled .

5570328,5,B00BBI7AKI,"Love the characters ... Great show to watch when you're in a mystery mood. I think I saw it was listed as ""drama"" ... It's a bit light for a full fledged drama show in my opinion. I wish they made more seasons!",1529193600,,210,3.9069767441860463

5570331,3,B00BBI7AKI,The first episode was weak. The second episode had become too stupid to watch by 3 minutes into the show. Do these shows even have professional writers?,1528934400,,152,4.666666666666667

5570333,3,B00BBI7AKI,"This is a show in the tradition of stupid American TV shows like Psych and 90210 with pretty actors, poor acting, and see-through plots.  So nice to see the Canadians are just as shallow.  The Russian of course plays chess, can execute a perfect pirouette, and subsists on vodka and caviar.  The cleaner is of course hispanic and has 6 kids and 1 grandkid (while looking only 35).  All the men are dumb and bumbling.  All the women are fawn over the Russian no matter how rude he is.  The head of security is a gruff antagonist, but even he goes soft on the guy.  And of course the camera shakes when they're in his security office to remind us of NYPD Blue or something.  Lines are spoken as if they read them off a card.  There isn't even an attempt at acting here.  The interior shots of the hotel are really stylish at least.  Production values are high (hey, when you don't have to pay writers, you can spend a lot on production!).  Fun if you're not looking for anything challenging.  All happy endings.  Nothing bad ever happens.  No blood or sex or violence.  I wouldn't pay money for it, but it was free.",1528848000,2,1113,4.35609756097561
5570334,5,B00BBI7AKI,"Interesting and captivating plots, dialogue, and performances.  But, only one season.  Can't imagine why.  Must have been very inexpensive to produce since it takes place mostly in a hotel and a few other areas.  First show in awhile that kept my attention.  Clean language, no gratuitous sex or violence, lots of chess, and charming characters.  Maybe that's why one season.  Just wish there were more seasons.",1528848000,2,411,5.136363636363637

5570336,5,B00BBI7AKI,"This is a smart and creative series with a clever plotline. An agoraphobic chess player solves crimes from his hotel that he cannot leave due to a traumatic incident involving his late fiance.  The main actor is witty and amusing. Unfortunately, one season is all that's offered and filmed of this show. Why they keep renewing season after season of all the lame shows, I'll never understand. It's sad that I have to search for the few good shows, such as this one, among the multitude of terrible ones.....sigh.",1528761600,2,512,4.752808988764045

Witty play on the ""consulting detective"" motif. Great cast led by a brilliant Shawn Doyle. Not a flawless seasona couple of late episodes aren't very good, and it ends on a cliffhangerbut highly recommended anyway, especially to fans of mysteries.",1528416000,2,951,11.337662337662337
5570344,1,B00BBI7AKI,"Didn't make it through the first episode. Knowing in advance that it only lasted one season I don't understand why there are so many high reviews. I all fairness understand that I quit watching after I was introduced to the characters. The drink Russian chess player and the two gay men that adopted a son, one of which kidnapped the son. Now the chase is on to find the boy.

I can not stand the gay couples with kids are normal promo aspect. There is no need for it. Why cater to a minor/minute population? It is not normal. It exists of course, but it is nowhere near the norm. So why have them as characters? No doubt there is some subtext and I don't want to be subjected to it.",1528329600,5,683,4.213740458015267

5570351,5,B00BBI7AKI,"We loved this show. We binge watched it in prime. We really enjoyed the characters and Doyles lines. I was heartbroken to learn it only lasted one season. The first season ended in a hard place, leaving things where they were left off was just cruel. Clearly they were originally contemplating a second season that never happened. Too bad.

5570358,5,B00BBI7AKI,I saw this series on Hulu - it only lasted 1 season on Canadian TV. It's brilliant! A different  mystery-drama-crime solving plot with each hour episode. Great characters and character development. Fun to watch! No gratuitous sex or violence. I don't know why this didn't run for 5yrs.

8565420,4,B00BBI7AKI,"I think they cancelled it because the audience reacted warmly to the Russians. It angered me that they bashed Putin but the Russian culture overall was basically portrayed as intellectual and affectionate. Admittedly drunken as well, but every other culture was stereotyped too, so that didn't bother me. There were very few black thugs which was sort of refreshing. It would be nice to find a sane path for political correctness, but I'm not convinced that ""PC"" is a benevolent movement. Without a cultural outlet for fear how does this stuff get resolved? Are we supposed to lie to ourselves and repress everything? And I'm tired of being judged by the entertainment industry. I mean really.

I think the show was cancelled because the Russian image was too positive. We found it difficult to hate him, even with all of his faults. One reviewer mentioned that the state dept probably funded it. That's believable. I love the romance of Russian culture.

People mention it copying Sherlock Holmes, but I think it's more like Nero Wolfe, who hates to leave home and has a lot of well-defined recurring characters around him. Wolfe is obsessed with orchids and food, this guy with vodka and chess. The series was fun. I'm sorry there aren't more stories. Maybe if Trump's talks with Putin go well we will be allowed by Big Brother to fall in love with Russians again. It would do our hearts good after all those cold British fish.",1530835200,,1429,4.781376518218623

8565425,3,B00BBI7AKI,"On the plus side, the stereotypical curmudgeon genius (in this instance a tortured chess player) is at least sometimes polite and occasionally apologetic. Also, despite his painful Russian accent, the lead usually has one or two clever lines and uses a sophisticated vocabulary with nice comfortable ease. Which makes is it even weirder that the rest of the show is so dumbed down. Most of the dialogue is lame, the plot twists predictable and the characters trite. Particularly annoying is the Latina cleaning lady who seems to have a lot of time on her hands considering how hard hotel maids work in real life and is the only character (despite that fact that she is his peer in both age and intelligence) who has to call our protagonist Mr Balagon instead of by his first name. He throws her big tips which is supposed to make it ok that while they are all brainstorming and mystery solving, everyone else sits around drinking vodka shots while she's cleaning the toilet. Last thing is the weird lighting. Everyone has a misty glowy halo light around them pretty much 24/7.
