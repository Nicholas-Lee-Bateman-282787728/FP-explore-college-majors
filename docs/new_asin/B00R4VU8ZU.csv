6899063,5,B00R4VU8ZU,been watched several times,1425772800,,26,5.75

6899065,2,B00R4VU8ZU,"The video angles were terrible....,all from the sidelines. I expected better",1425340800,,76,6.0
6899066,1,B00R4VU8ZU,"Disappointed, no gamecast, no time, no down, no distance, just a narrator with a sprinkling of Paul Kiel radio coverage. Hearing Gus Johnson call TD to Devin Smith ""CAAR Daaaale Jonnes"" would have made it worth the price.",1425168000,6,221,4.842105263157895
6899067,5,B00R4VU8ZU,This is a perfect recap of what most Buckeye fans consider to be the greatest of all seasons. Kudos to the Channel 10 sports department.,1425081600,,136,4.48
6899068,5,B00R4VU8ZU,Great quality,1424908800,,13,6.0
6899069,2,B00R4VU8ZU,"I guess I was a little misled on this. I was expecting the ""entire"" season to be one big video highlight with music and narration that included the Big Ten Championship, The Sugar Bowl & The National Championship included. This was a short t.v. show interview with Urban along with some highlights of their games. I was disappointed. It just wasn't what I expected and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It would have been fine just to see this on t.v. but not to have spent the money for a dvd. A big letdown for me.",1423958400,18,517,4.34020618556701
6899070,3,B00R4VU8ZU,"They only show a single ""greatest play"" from each game and Dom talks about each game.  I guess I missed the whole ""Silver Bullet"" reference, I assume he is talking about the defense?  Pretty lame to consider this a season review.",1423440000,8,229,4.560975609756097
6899071,5,B00R4VU8ZU,"Great recap of the season. I would have loved more highlights, but I guess there isn't enough memory on the DVD.",1423094400,,112,4.380952380952381
6899072,5,B00R4VU8ZU,What fun to watch.  I recommend this anyone.  The team Up North may want to watch and take some notes.,1430697600,,102,4.05
6899073,4,B00R4VU8ZU,"Wished the DVD would have had the playoffs, too",1430352000,,47,4.333333333333333
6899074,5,B00R4VU8ZU,ALL YOU  NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE GREAT SEASON,1429574400,,44,3.888888888888889
6899075,5,B00R4VU8ZU,"i see all the negative reviews, I think mostly its people who didn't realize what they were buying. Game Time with Urban Meyer, is the weekly show recapping the game before and talking about the next opponent. It is taped on Thursday or Friday of the week following the previous game. Then it is televised the Saturday morning. This is done to recap last game and get everyone informed and excited about the game later in the day.

If I bought this expecting a season long highlight show and in depth review. I too would be disappointed. Because this is run through Ohio State Football & the athletic department. You are going to get the calls from the Ohio State radio booth, not national TV guys. I hope this review helps everyone understood what it is you are purchasing and if you buy it I believe you can enjoy it a lot because you will know what it is your buying. Have a great day and Go Bucks ",1428451200,10,901,4.357142857142857
