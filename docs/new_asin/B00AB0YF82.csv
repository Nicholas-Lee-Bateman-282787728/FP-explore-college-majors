5408389,2,B00AB0YF82,"There is a documentary out there called EARS, OPEN. EYEBALLS, CLICK.
This footage is from the exact same training platoon from the documentary I mentioned before.
They took the footage that they edited out on the first movie and threw it into this one. Really disappointed when I realized I was basically watching something I already did years ago.",1383004800,11,348,4.915254237288136
5408390,3,B00AB0YF82,"Although I came in with lowered expectations based on the fact that this was filmed at MCRD San Diego, and not Parris Island, I was still a bit let down by the overall quality of production. The light filter on the camera must not have been working during filming. That, or they used a toaster to capture the motion. While that is annoying enough, the sound quality is even worse. I don't think there is a continuous five-minute segment of the film that does not have serious clipping issues. That makes it hard to watch.

With all of the negatives, I would still recommend the film to those seeking to join our ranks, as it will offer a good insight to the softer, gentler ways of the new Corps. For those who have already earned the title, you will enjoy reliving the sights and sounds of recruit training. Semper Fidelis.",1382918400,,824,4.493333333333333
5408391,5,B00AB0YF82,"Wow! I was in Marine Corps bootcamp in 1977, and the drill instructors in this movie are just as intense when I was in. If you are a former Marine you will flashback to the day you stood on those yellow footprints. If you are contemplating joining our beloved Corps, this may scare the crap out of you! These guys with the campaign hats strike fear into the sloth recruits. Staff Sergeant Nichols is the kind of Senior Drill Instructor you would run through walls for. His speech on racism and sexism exemplifies his wisdom and discipline. And he demands no less!",1376524800,16,563,4.529411764705882
5408392,5,B00AB0YF82,"When I decided to buy this DVD I didn't know exactly how I would react reliving one of the most challenging tasks I've ever done in my life.  After watching, it brought me back to the 'yellow foot prints'.  SSgt Nichols and his Team exemplified the very essence of becoming a US Marine w/out any reservations.  I went through boot camp in Diego back in '79 and I must say things were much different.  I still remember SSgt Garcia who was our Sr DI was one of the most fiercest, intense man that ever walked this earth.  He had nothing but Letters on his chest w/ a Force Recon pin.  I heard he spent 3 tours in Nam all Recon related before he hit MCRD.  It was a different time and place when I went through boot camp because all the DIs would swear and cuss every other word when screaming at the top of their lungs to us 'recruits'.  It was loud, chaotic and a lot of running or moving fast.  No walking & no unnecessary movement; period otherwise the DIs will smell you out and before you know it you are on your face mountain climbing or push-ups until you can't feel your arms.
There would also be a lot more physical contact from what I remember than what is on this DVD.  May be they decided to edit those parts out and not scare away the children.
This DVD certainly brought back a special time in my life in setting the course of where I am today.

5408394,5,B00AB0YF82,"I highly recommend this film to any and all current, former, and future Marines. Also for any of you military and Marine Corps enthusiasts -- this film gives you a real deal, in-depth perspective, of what it's like to go from the civilian world to the Marine Corps world! That is something every Marine can attest too, and by watching this, now you can too. There is nothing like the real thing, but this gets ya pretty darn close! Get this film, it's well worth it.",1354492800,7,466,4.430232558139535

5408396,5,B00AB0YF82,"Brings me back old memories of my time at MCRD San Diego. I still remember everything as if it were yesterday; the cadence, the chaos, lack of sleep, attempting to keep my bearing while my DIs were screaming with their nasty spit spraying over my face or slaying recruits on the Quarter Deck in a hilarious manner.
I know this is an off-shoot of ""Ears Open Eyeballs Click"" but I always enjoy watching recruit training footage. Need to watch part 2 next!

5408402,2,B00AB0YF82,"I was pretty disappointed when I saw this DVD. As another review stated this is basically the b-roll footage of another much better documentary called ""Ears, Open, Eyeballs, Click"". Actually I'm positive about 75% of it I've seen on youtube already.

Don't expect any high quality production, most of it looks like it was filmed with a circa early 2000's home camera.

That being said, which I know is a little harsh, it did bring back some good memories and captured the essence of Black Friday. Keep that in mind, it doesn't show the entire training schedule throughout.",1386547200,,572,4.826530612244898

8549503,3,B00AB0YF82,"I watched Dark Dawn 1, 2, & 3. As a Marine veteran and viewer, I would have liked more. If you are looking for an uncut peek at the daily monotony of boot camp, this is what you want. It is raw footage with little to no context. It gives the feeling of a home movie as if someone carried around a handycam at boot camp and showed it to their friends and family while on boot leave. It is a very accurate reflection of daily life in boot camp, even though the good stuff that everybody wants to see, hit the cutting room floor.

I was disappointed that there was no footage of field training up north or the transformation from civilian to Marine that is so iconic with Marine Corps boot camp. It cuts off half-way through boot camp. I don't think that is what the producers intended. There must be more to the story with production issues. I would have liked some context such as drill instructor interviews or countdown to graduation calendar or something.

What I liked: It is accurate to a fault. This is what you should show someone before they ship to boot camp. It was a display of what I hated the most about boot camp, the mind numbing repetition and constant noise.

What I didn't like: No field training footage. Several minutes of repetitive footage of the boring stuff like field day, daily hygiene, and the like.",1461024000,,1325,4.4

8549506,2,B00AB0YF82,"I'll start off by saying that this is a review of the DVD itself not the documentary because the DVD I received and the replacement both didn't work.  One thing to keep in mind is that this is the longer version of the documentary of Ears Open Eyeballs Click so if you have that this one really isn't anything special.  Now for the DVD review.....

So when I first received the DVD I saw that box had a large crack on the front cover.  The box actually seemed really flimsy so that may have had something to do with it.  Then as I was holding it and trying to open it, it became apparent that the disc had fallen off of the prongs in the jewel case.  Since it had obviously moved around a lot in shipment the disc had a significant amount of scratches.  I didn't think it would work, but I tried to play it anyway and didn't get far before it froze up.  I called Amazon customer support for a replacement only to have the same problems so I just got a refund.

With all this in mind I can't recommend this for anyone at all but especially not if you have or have seen ""Ears Opens Eyeballs Click"".",1453161600,,1096,4.132075471698113

8549509,5,B00AB0YF82,"I have to disagree with the dissenters of this video, especially anyone who claims that this is ""B roll"" material"".  ""Ears, Open, Eyeballs, Click"" showed you snippets...the highlights...which will NOT convey to non-Marines and non-enlistees and the public-at-large what ""the life"" is like in the Marine Corps.  What you see HERE is the GRIND, the monotonous, frustrating stuff that that slowly eats away at patience, resolve, comfort, the actual 'process' of breaking down a recruit so that he can be rebuilt into a Marine..the process of weeding out the non-Marine material, which is no B.S.  The former edit of this footage was frankly, IMO, too entertainment-based.  Black Friday shows the monotony, the dull wear-down which IS the real deal.  Whether it's from the same cycle as the former edit or not, who cares?  Is your loved one in there?  No?  Then it doesn't matter.  I recommend this film to anyone wanting to catch a tiny glimpse into the reality of the pain that makes a Marine...or to any Marines who want to convey to civilians who might not appreciate it, just what it took to earn the title he or she earned.  Frankly, this video makes me miss the pain even more!  Wish I was still in.
