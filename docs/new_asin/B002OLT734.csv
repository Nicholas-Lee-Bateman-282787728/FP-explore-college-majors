8376121,5,B002OLT734,One of the best episodes!! I'm in it. I'm the German soldier firing the Panzerschreck at the Sherman tank. We had a great time filming it.,1423353600,,138,4.346153846153846
8376122,1,B002OLT734,"Why does A&E do such cheap DVDs? Can't anyone there do editing when they splice a series of episodes together? Apparently not. The overlapping few minutes of one episode to another is very annoying but they are too inept to do it right. And who thought ""actors"" who don't even resemble the subject to be adequate? Or do they think their audience is too stupid to notice? Probably the latter. Someone needs to tell A&E that occasionally people over the age of 10 watch these.",1357430400,,474,4.588235294117647
8376123,2,B002OLT734,"I've seen other movies of the Battle Of The Bulge that were much better.

This DVD seems like a put together of a weekly series, where each episode starts with the last few minutes of the previous episode.

Its mixsture of shots of Patton and shots of actors who played Patton but didn't resemble Patton was terrible.

The narrative mentions some of the short commings of the Sherman tank. These can be attributed to the designers and the overpriced help in Washington. It  didn't mention other worse problems. The tank had a very  high  profile, insufficient armour, inadequate artillery, and  worst of all it used an aircraft engine that used high octane gasoline. All the Germans had  to do was aim for the gas tank and BOOM!

I spite of his personal shortcomings, Patton was an outstanding General. Without him, the war in France would have lasted much longer.",1266451200,,864,4.74496644295302
