It manages in only 50 minutes to explain the profound complexity of the Mayan calendar - which is much more complex and advanced than our European calendar. This raises a number of questions: how could the ancient Mayan civilization possibly access such a profound knowledge, which our contemporary science can barely explain? How did the Mayans know so much about Astronomy? Did they truly receive this knowledge from some advanced extraterrestrial form of life? Truly, this documentary inspired me to research and learn more about this enigmatic Mayan culture! Outstanding documentary, thanks to A&E! When it comes to price - A&E sells it for $24.95. Beware of this seller ""forgetthegouge"" - they offer ""IN ADDITION TO THIS TITLE YOU GET 3 MORE SIMILAR EPISODES A TOTAL OF 4 SHOWS"" - I don't believe this is legal according to Amazon.com Rules & Regulations - such a cheap offer seems very suspicious as if perhaps all of these ""4 SHOWS"" are homemade bootlegs, which may not even play on a regular player. I would not risk to purchase from this seller for such a suspiciously cheap price.",1297641600,2,1214,4.926829268292683

I highly recommend this thought provoking look at the Mayan culture's obsession with time - but not at these prices.  You can buy this DVD new for $24.95 from the History Channel where it originally aired.",1237420800,3,275,4.269230769230769
