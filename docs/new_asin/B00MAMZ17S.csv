6565751,5,B00MAMZ17S,"This movie will change the way you look at coaches and how they interact with your kids. The values taught by Coach Lad to his players focused on being a perfect person, not just a perfect football player, and he stressed that the better you are at life the better you will be on the field. And it worked in a huge way. For over 30 years his players worked at being perfect sons, brothers, nephews, and trying to be perfect in all things in their lives which led to the greatest winning streak in the history of sports. Coach Lad said that his secret weapon is love. If you can love your teammates so deeply that you won't let them fail the results are astounding.
Any parent will tell you that coaches have a huge impact on their kids lives. For that very reason every coach and parent should see this movie so they can approach coaching from Lad's point of view and create better kids which in turn will create better players - not the other way around.",1414195200,48,955,4.311111111111111
6565752,4,B00MAMZ17S,Amazing movie went to the screening a few months back. Left me with a similar feeling that Remember the Titans did...definitely a movie I'd add to my collection once it comes out!,1413676800,5,179,4.625
6565753,5,B00MAMZ17S,"I loved it, which I really did not expect.  I was told that it was ""something about 'it's not all about winning, blah blah'"", so I had pretty low expectations.  VERY powerful movie!  It starts with the loss of the longest winning streak in the game of football, so how do you pull an entire movie after that?  But they did, and it was amazing.

It ISN'T all about winning.  It's also about HOW you win.  There are many Scriptural references, so if that bothers you, it may not be the movie for you.  I, however, left the pre-screening very thoughtful, and that happens very rarely.  If a movie makes you think about your life and how you can make better choices, it's a movie worth seeing.  I'll definitely watch it again.  Great for the entire family!",1409961600,123,752,4.416058394160584
6565754,5,B00MAMZ17S,"I now have a new favorite football movie! I enjoyed it so much, I'm thinking about going back to the theatre to see it a second time before waiting for the DVD to come out. I will say that the movie ambles out of the starting gate (rather than sprinting), but ""Game"" quickly gathers momentum and has you totally hooked. At first, I thought Jim Caviezel seemed a bit subdued in the lead role, until the film clips of the actual coach played during the credits. Then I realized that Caviezel had done a masterful job of faithfully reproducing the calm, understated style of Coach Ladouceur. Prior to ""Game,"" my all-time favorite football movie was ""Remember the Titans."" But ""Game"" has much more believable football footage and the story totally hooked me. I CAN'T WAIT to own this fabulous, family friendly movie! And I should add that even if you aren't a football fan, anyone who is interested in watching a great story about character standing tall will LOVE this story. I never watch horse racing, but loved ""Secretariat."" In the same way, non-fans of football, especially if you're parents, may well love ""Game"" as much as I did!",1409616000,76,1133,4.698492462311558
6565755,5,B00MAMZ17S,One of the best movies ever!,1409529600,10,28,3.8333333333333335

6565757,3,B00MAMZ17S,"This very heavy football-centric movie is a possibly worthwhile movie. Production quality and acting ranged from relatively decent to excellent. The football scenes in particular were very well shot and I thought quite impressive. I did think the movie jumped around a bit in a way that wasn't always helpful - it seemed liked it needed some better editing at times as it seemed to try to go several different directions.

This movie has some ""Christian"" components to it because the school in question is a Catholic school, however it is very toned down - and as a Christian, I didn't particularly think the little portrayal of Christianity they did show was particularly helpful (in fact, I think a case could even potentially be made that it was a negative). This is a very different type of football movie from ""Facing the Giants"", which has a much more positive Christian-centric focus.

The central theme of this movie was that individual glory isn't nearly as important as the team. But not just the team's glory, but truly being a ""brotherhood"" - really genuinely loving and caring for one another. First and foremost, the coach taught his players that they were to be a united brotherhood that genuinely unconditionally loved one another and supported one another. Although the team enjoyed great success, the coach made clear that that success was not the goal, but rather the goal was their own ""growing up"" in really becoming the type of men that would sacrifice one for another. The movie portrays the team enduring several challenges, including the death of a player, and a major defeat, on this journey.

I think most people, whether you like football or not, will be able to identify with the desire for a genuine ""brotherhood"" or ""sisterhood"" of people that genuinely love and care about you. We all really want that, and that's one of the reasons why I believe people (perhaps subconsciously) enjoy this movie so much. As I was watching it, as a Christian my thinking was that what the coach was trying to do with his football team is pretty much what the CHURCH is supposed to be. The Church is supposed to be a family where we are deeply committed to one another. It's actually kind of a shame that there are football teams out there with more genuine commitment to one another than some churches have. It's a basic human need to want to experience true acceptance and love - and to know that no matter what, there are people that will be with you through it all. We all want that. That's one of the reasons why gangs are so attractive - because it does - at least to a degree - meet this need. It isn't hard to see why a football team that really emphasized these things could be so successful too.

I must say I found it refreshing though to see a football team where they were actually encouraged to share their feelings with one another, demonstrate their love for one another, etc. It really countered a lot of the traditional male macho message that's out there. (I must admit though that at times, I felt this was a bit overdone/overly dramatic). Also, given this and some of the popular cultural messages in society today, I was glad they also showed these guys with girlfriends (though I didn't really care for the way that they showed/portrayed this).

There is a major tragedy where someone dies and questions of God's goodness are raised. As a Christian, one of my absolute pet-peaves is when a movie raises questions of God's goodness and then doesn't resolve those questions. Unfortunately, this movie fits the same trend of any number of other movies. The best answer the movie offers for the reason for why this person dies is that God for some reason must have wanted him. I think they were probably honest in that they really didn't know why, but it just rang hollow to me. When a movie raises questions like this of God's goodness but then doesn't resolve those questions, I believe it actually can end up pushing people away from God rather than to Him. It just serves to harden people that much more from ever wanting to come to God. Especially when the tragedy is portrayed in such a way that you really FEEL the pain of those involved. Further, the Christianity portrayed in the movie was nominal at best to very ""religious"" at worst. It frustrated me and I honestly think I would have rather they just left out ALL Christian references in this film rather than trying to insert some along with raising the ""why would God allow this?"" questions that aren't resolved.

There is some bad language in this film - it is generally of the milder variety, but it is there (though not overbearing). Because of the language and some mature themes in the movie, I do not recommend this movie for young children. Overall, I felt this movie was a bit of a mixed bag. It has some worthwhile things to say, but the lack of tying the Christianity to these worthwhile things in a positive way, and indeed portraying a kind of frustrating view of Christianity, was a turn-off to me, as was some of the language.

6565758,4,B00MAMZ17S,"""When the Game Stands Tall (2014 release; 115 min.) brings the story of De La Salle's 2004 high school football season. De La Salle is a Catholic high school in Concord, CA. As the movie opens, we get archive footage of how the team has build an amazing 150 game winning streak over an 11 year period. The Spartans win the 2003 Northern California Section title game, and the streak now stand at 151. During the off-season, the team is hit by several personal tragedies, and then must get ready for the 2004 football season. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, if you don't love high school football, save yourself the trouble and go see another movie. Much has been made about the faith/inspirational aspect of the movie, including in the trailer. I was rather surprised to see how the school's Catholic nature has been 'disguised' (I don't recall the word ""Catholic"" being mentioned a single time in the movie). Second, the game sequences are brought outstandingly, most of all the game De La Salle plays at that other powerhouse (in SoCal), Long Beach Poly, just terrific. Third, coach Bob Ladouceur (played with great restrain by Jim Caviezel, best known for his role as Jesus Christ in Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ) is by all means an outstanding football coach and an inspiration to his players, even as we see him at time struggling with 'doing right by' his family, including his wife (played by Laura Stern in her most ""mousy"" role ever) and his son Danny (played by Matthew Daddario), a WR on the team. When the streak is over, he implores his kids ""Don't let one football game define who you are!"". But bottom line: this mostly will speak most to you if you love high school football, which I do--my son (not a football player) attended a traditional football power house Catholic HS in the HS football rich area that is Cincinnati.

The movie opened this weekend, and the matinee screening where I saw this at today here in Cincinnati was not particularly well attended. It didn't surprise me, as the movie waffles between being an inspirational drama and an outright HS football movie. If you love HS football, I'd readily recommend last year's Oscar-winning documentary ""Undefeated"" (nothing to do with De La Salle). As a HS football enthusiast, I enjoyed ""When The Game Stands Tall"" quite a bit. The movie's final scenes gave me shivers.",1408838400,36,2463,4.738927738927739

_________________________________________________

A record thats yet to be beaten, Coach Bob Ladouceur inspired his De La Salle high school team to 151 victories before losing that record the next season. Based on true events, director Thomas Carter tells the story of one coach who regroups his team after a number of tragedies and re-enstilles the value of family. The team had always been remembered by fans and watchers that the streak meant everything. As Coach Ladouceur readies his team to face their biggest challenge to date, Polly High, the team-mates find courage and strength to pull off the biggest upset and honor the man that got them there in the first place.

Weve seen countless re-tellings of history in football films; including Remember The Titans and Gridiron Gang that possessed elements of inspiration. Here no less we see actor Jim Caviezel, as Bob Ladouceur, play the part of one man who builds his team around the idea of family and by their best efforts will lead them to glory. Ladouceur has a health scare after years of stress and history of smoking that makes him rethink about his life-style and how it affects his family. In a supporting role, Laura Dern, plays the wife of Ladouceur (Bev) and wants whats best for him; that including a position to coach at a university. More importantly, the opportunity for Bob to spend more time with his son Danny (Matthew Daddario) as the health scare has affected him the most.

Going in to see the movie I had expectations of jumping between timelines that showed how the team made it to 151 wins and what that achievement has done for them. Instead, the film took an interesting approach of not revisiting their streak but the events that happened after their streak was over. We followed some of the players who are in their final year of varsity and the decisions they make concerning playing for college teams. Their was one story involving T.K. Kelly (Stephan James) who after getting accepted to play for Oregon State, gets killed by a shooter. His closest friend Cam (SerDarius Blain) takes the brunt of the tragedy when he had just lost his mom and was supposed to go with T.K. and play in Oregon. This one story-line was the most effective to watch and had the emotional affect that the rest of the film lacked.

The direction of the film felt off as the 2nd act was more of everyone going about their business as the streak lived on. It wasn't until the 3rd act that De La Salle starts the season again and loses the streak on the first game. At this point it was something new I hadnt seen before in terms of the writing. I thought the streak would have ended closer to the beginning and then the fall-out with the tragedies and gaining their way back to championship status. As the movie came to a close the team would win against Poly and then jumped a number of games to them reaching the division title. Their battle against Poly would have been a more better movie closer then what we got in the end. If you stick around for the end credits we get to see footage of Coach Ladouceur and his team. Being able to watch him motivate his team by emphasizing effort over touchdowns or wins was effective in his coaching career. You cant help but feel inspired by his method of teaching his players the values that would slowly transform them into young men.

Compared to other films, again, this doesnt do justice or put a stamp on how a re-telling of history should be done. There were too many clichs of some of the struggles the players had off the field and what happens to a team after dealing with defeat. Not to get too political but there was one scene involving the players visiting a VA hospital. When you consider what has happened with the VA scandal and how VAs have been getting a bad wrap for a lack of support to veterans, you cant help but feel the movie was trying to show a positive light on the situation. Aside from that, there wasn't any stand-out performances to really boast about. Cutting to the chase lets just call it a generic film weve seen time and time again. Will When The Game Stands Tall be remembered after this weekend? More then likely itll convince you to watch Remember The Titans and relive a better experience.",1408752000,2,4295,4.601827676240209

6565769,3,B00MAMZ17S,"We love the movie - it was the poor quality of the picture that we have issues with.  We have a pretty new LG 4K television, so there should be no problem with that, but any scenes that involved action were a pixelled blur.  (That's why we got the snazzy TV, to avoid that.)  When I went to the troubleshooting guide on Amazon, one of the ways to solve the issue was to stop using every other device that uses our WiFi.  Really?  That's the best you can do?  I have ordered this video on Blu-Ray/DVD, so we won't have this problem with them, but how disappointing that the extra that I paid so that we could ""watch it now"" was such poor quality.

Laura Dern is a terrific actress, but has little to do in this movie. Perhaps that's a reflection of the true relationship that existed between the Coach and his long-suffering wife, Bev. Strange that the movie never acknowledges that he divorced her and remarried a much younger woman.

6565825,5,B00MAMZ17S,"Very  much enjoyed this movie. Watched it with my 13 year-old son and a couple of his friends. All of us were engaged, focused, and moved by this true story. Jim Caviezel is convincing as Coach Ladouceur and the relationships demonstrated with his on-film athletes is touching. I appreciated some laugh-out-loud moments, especially because there is some tragedy. There is a ""hollywood"" touch to this true story, especially since some of the on-film football players and their experiences are combinations of a couple of players over the years. I imagine this was done to protect identities. It is a fast paced movie and felt like it was over in a blink. It was a good film to watch with young teenagers because of the values portrayed and the unfortunate negative consequences of those not embraced and followed. I will enjoy watching this again.",1493856000,3,846,4.916083916083916

The actor's and the film makers had the sense to make a movie about an exceptional program and a great coach. And what that inspiration can do to change peoples ideals for life.
Playing a man of such character, a trait rare today. Was handled skillfully by an actor who is more careful about who he portrays, than what it pays.",1472515200,,571,4.296296296296297

6565968,4,B00MAMZ17S,"The one thing you can always count on when watching a football film, is that it's going to be exciting. It doesn't matter if it's a true story, like When The Game Stands Tall, or a made up one like Friday Night Lights. It doesn't matter if the team has won 100 straight games or lost 100 straight games. Every film about football is going to be exciting, so what makes one better than the other? The personalities involved, it all comes down to who the film is focused on and this film has it's eyes on the prize. Jim Caviezel stars as Bobby Ladouceur, one of the most successful high school football coaches of all-time. Ladouceur became a national celebrity, not only because of a big winning streak, but also because of the way he incorporated family values and religion into his coaching, trying to make his player more well-rounded individuals. Caviezel was outstanding, as he is in everything, but after watching six seasons of Person of Interest, it's almost disappointing seeing Caviezel in a role where he doesn't kill anyone. The other focus of the film is Alexander Ludwig, who portrays Chris Ryan, a kid who has all the talent in the world, but has to decide, if he's pushing himself toward greatness for himself or because of a psychotic father. Ludwig always gets second billing, but as with the Hunger Games, nothing would be as good without him. He is the unsung hero of this film as he rounds out the emotional roller-coaster. When The Game Stands Tall has action, emotion, conflict, religion, family, love, hate, a little bit of everything and believe it or not, at the heart of it all is a simple, stupid little game called football. This film was great, it reminded me a lot of the TV version of Friday Night Lights and it's an absolute can't miss for sports enthusiasts.",1472256000,,1791,4.617554858934169

6566217,4,B00MAMZ17S,"I gotta admit, even though When the Game Stands Tall is based on a true football story, the story presented on film didn't move me nearly as much as it did for others who've reviewed the movie and gave it high scores.  The first half is pretty boring.  That's about an hours worth of weak writing.  That's the problem right there- the writing takes an extremely long time to actually go somewhere interesting.  Jim Caviezel plays the coach of a high school football team who's on a huge roll.  They've won like 150 games in a row which is an amazing accomplishment when you think about it.  A man at one of the meetings questions this record and accuses the team of cheating, but he never backs up his claims with any proof which is unfortunate.  Why tease us like that?  They should have followed through with this.

There's other questionable moments in the writing.  Jim suffers a heart attack and it turns out that he won't be able to coach his team during his recovery.  This upsets his son, who's also a high school football player, to the point he disrespects his father and storms out of the hospital room angry.  Seriously?  What kind of kid would be selfish enough to care more about his football playing than his own father's health?  Also one of the characters gets shot and killed, but we never find out why this shooting occurred or what happened to the shooter.  It felt like an incomplete part of the story.

The weak writing affects the characters too.  Jim Caviezel is flat out boring as a coach.  He shows very little emotion and he's very bland.  While we see that his team respected him a great deal by constantly pointing at him on the football field, listening closely to his advice and even citing him as a big influence on their careers, we the viewers weren't seeing the same highly respected man due to the weak writing.  On a side note I find it interesting how much Jim resembles my old high school math teacher in both the same facial complexion and calm personality.  He was also a football coach.  The teammates occasionally show some personality such as the one student who has low self-esteem and thinks he's bad luck, and the other kid who has a strict demanding father (Clancy Brown) who expects nothing less than perfection from his son and basically threatens him to go out there and win the old man a trophy.

The second half of the movie, precisely after the shooting I mention above occurs, that's when the writing gets better.  The team visits a hospital for the handicapped and that seems to be the motivation they need to perform on the field and work better as a team.  They do just that.  The second half of When the Game Stands Tall is all about a couple lengthy football games and how the team perseveres/overcomes their equally talented opponents. The very last play is a special moment.  Best moment of the movie.  I won't spoil it, but it's unique and probably has never been done in a football drama before.  Because of the weak writing in the first half and lousy character development, I'd place this movie on the lesser end of the inspirational sports movie genre.  It needed more substance.  At least the second half improves enough for me to award the movie a pretty high rating.  Recommended but barely.",1440633600,,3261,4.559380378657487

His pressure on them to ""bring home the win"" was ruining not only their spirit but his relationship with them and his wife.  I bought them this movie and after watching it - they, once again and see the big picture of life.  I raised my sons and his two children in the Catholic faith, but they lost it along the way.  They have watched this movie a few times now and as this football season begins, I can see a positive change in their approach to the game.

6566299,4,B00MAMZ17S,"When the Game Stands Tall is a sports drama about the record-setting 151-game winning streak by the football team of the De La Salle High School of Concord,California from 1992 to 2003. This is an adaptation of the 2003 book by the same title by Neil Hayes. It stars Jim Caviezel as Bob Ladouceur,coach of De La Salle, together with Laura Dern, Michael Chiklis,Terry Eidson and Alexander Ludwig.

The story centers on the journey of Coach Bob Ladouceur. He took the coaching duties for De La Salle football team and took the Spartans from obscurity to a 151-game winning streak that shattered all records for any American sport. When the streak is broken, and tragedy strikes the team, Coach Lad must teach his players - and the entire town - that it's not about how you fall, but how you get back up.

Too bad that the movie tried too much to be an inspirational movie. Unfortunately,it ended up into becoming an over-sentimental movie that the dramatic scenes fall flat and simply lack authenticity and realism. In addition to that, the characters are somewhat lacking despite having great actors involved like Jim Caviezel to provide emotional honesty to the character that he is portraying. Finally, the film is just full of sports clich&eacute;s that one would feel bored by its lack of originality despite the fact that the story of De La Salle Spartans football team is interesting and compelling enough for the viewer.",1431388800,,1426,4.840163934426229

6566316,4,B00MAMZ17S,"This movie is one of those that I wasn't really sure I wanted to watch.  I like sports-centric inspirational kind of movies but I was a bit concerned that this might be a bit too preachy for my tastes.  But in reality the message has been toned down to the point so that it really doesnt try to push the concept of faith down your throat.  This movie is in the vein of other similar style of football movies but isn't quite as flashy as those and maybe not as strong overall but I really like the message that it tries to convey that sports is not the most important thing in life and whether you win or lose isn't what you will be remembered for but how you handle those situations in life.  Although this isn't my favorite football/sports type movie, the story is well done and based on real events and has a good message.

Of course the ""right"" way is basically recruiting gifted high school athletes from their local public high schools and ""paying"" them to attend the private school...and play football. The ""paying"" in the form of a giving these athlete/students a private education, which costs the families of non-athletically talented students $16,000 per year. Without a doubt, Lad is an outstanding teacher, mentor, and coach. But I wonder how many lower paid, public school coaches would flourish, given his advantages?",1424476800,,595,5.549450549450549

Remember the Titans and Miracle are two of my favorite movies, so this seemed like a no-brainer. But let me tell you it was more powerful of a story than I anticipated. I was crying within about 15 to 20 minutes, and it happened a few more times after that.

The acting was most definitely on point and the casting was incredible. It makes you think about your life, and the choices your making. It forced me to think about my priorities in life and what I should be putting more weight on.

The sports scenes were incredibly well done. It didn't look like a faked football movie at all, the hits and everything all looked realistic.

This movie tells the story of what a team does after losing a 151 game winning streak. I found the plot a little sloppy (probably trying to keep it close to the real story),This movie will not appeal to people who take their sports or a career in sports very seriously especially the ending which represents making a greater point about a team being a brotherhood and not about personal gain.

6566605,4,B00MAMZ17S,"We chose this for family movie night.  I was expecting a typical rising crescendo with a grand victory a la ""Remember the Titains"" or ""Coach Carter"", while their is the excitement of the games, that is just the icing, not the cake.  The cake is about a coach living the things he teaches, that the effort is the thing, mistakes will be made, failures will come, but it is the effort we put in our work, family, lives that makes it all worth while.

The story starts as a 151 game winning streak comes to a close, How does a team, a coach, a school, bounce back when they lose their feeling of invincibility.

There is some religion in this, as the school is a Catholic All boys High School, and Bob Ladouceur (coach) is a man of faith.  It his belief that football is a way to teach boys to be men.  That they may not always have perfect games, but they should always give perfect effort.

As the coach tries to rebuild his teams spirits, they are faced with set backs.  It is how they face these that make the story so inspirational.

As I do with all ""inspired by"" movies, I went on the net to see how close the movie was to the real life story.  I was surprised to found that most of it is true.  While a couple of the characters are actually compilations of several real people, and a few of the actions took place either before or after the 2004 season, most of the story is true to life.

To see a man live up to his teachings, to see young boys become honorable men because of his teaching/coaching; made of a nice movie night.

I recommend this movie.",1421107200,3,1559,4.2087542087542085

6566607,5,B00MAMZ17S,"Film is an excellent exposition of the true story of De La Salle High School football team, their coach Bob Ladouceur and assistant Terry Eldson. Inspirational message of the film is not so much in the success of their amazing 151 consecutive wins, but in the triumph of altruism and self-giving instilled within the athletes that helped form their character.  My daughter is a high school soccer coach who took her team to see this film hoping to implant these same charisms within her own players . . .  and each one of them came away challenged to be a better person.  She now owns the film and hopes it will to continue to inspire future players not only to be skilled athletes but giving and compassionate human beings.",1421020800,,724,4.596899224806202

I think it was a bit predictable, however it was based on a true story.  Well acted and I recommend it, especially for parents who have children that need an inspiring message without preaching to them.  The only reason I have this 4 out of 5 stars is because I personally always read the 4 and below star reviews first.",1421020800,,437,4.228915662650603
6566612,1,B00MAMZ17S,"I wish I could give this movie zero stars. The action sequences are choppy and the ""commentary"" during the games is so unrealistic and stiff, that it is beyond laughable.

The characters are what you'd expect. There's an overbearing father, a teammate dies, there's some strife within the team and the coach has a major life crisis.

Trying to portray a program that had won 151 straight games as an underdog just doesn't work. Losing at Bellevue, Washington, was not the monumental upset the movie portrayed it as. Bellevue won numerous state titles in a row -- it wasn't like De la Salle lost to Tiddlywink Valley.

The ""commentators"" then noted about how the team rallying from an 0-2 start to win a title was such an incredible comeback. Not hardly -- those were non-conference games.

I'd like to penalize the filmmakers 15 yards for this sappy schlock.",1421020800,2,858,4.777027027027027

6566638,4,B00MAMZ17S,"What bothered me the most was the actor who played the main character, the school coach.  I see that there was a good resemblance of this actor with the actual coach (watch the closing credits with footage of the team and coach), but I found the acting to be uninspired.  He really seemed bored in the role.  Now perhaps that is an accurate portrayal of the school's coach, but the job of the actor is not to imitate that real person but to bring to the screen the character's inspiration.  I didn't feel it.

I much more enjoyed the supporting characters especially the one who played his son and the one who was the star running back.  The film itself did a good job of demonstrating that the value of team work versus individualism.  Now that is a lesson that some might want to debate, but this isn't the movie that gives that discussion.  The movie character who is on the individualist track comes to mend his ways and he is shown little sympathy prior to conversion.  In that way the movie does come across as preaching.  I'm not arguing against its message, but it just wasn't subtle about it is all I'm saying.

For football fans, there are several scenes of intense game action and these were performed very well and with credible results.  Overall, it is a good family movie and mine enjoyed it.",1420588800,,1306,4.487288135593221

The back bone of this team and the glue that holds it together. Assistant coach Michael Chiklis is wonderful and the whole football team of kids are outstanding. The standout has to be Alexander Ludwig as Chris Ryan and he has one more cross to bear....his father who is living his life thru his son and is a horrid man. Why 4 stars especially since I loved the movie? This is a true story and I understand that some people are very religious but to me, it was being shoved in my face at every turn. Is it a true sports story or is it one of the Christian movies?

Where this movie expands that theme is that it also applies to the coaches, not just the players. If sports would focus on skills, teamwork and character and not worry about who ""wins"", we would be amazed at the young men and women that we would see being developed. This is a hard lesson to learn because our society has idolized sport stars. Hopefully this movie will speak to the hearts of the men and women, both young and old who watch it.

A glimpse at a guy who is making a difference for the good in the world through his faith in Christ and love of young people. His goal is simply to help young men become people who can be relied upon by the rest of society. Pay your bills and don't kick the dog. A bottom line, gospel-centric movie.

We first saw it in a movie theather and I had to admit that she was 100% correct. We eventually purchased the Blu-ray version which has first-rate video and audio.

Although you can certainly call this a ""football movie"", it's really a lot more about boys coming of age. Jim Caviezel does his usual fine acting job and Michael Chiklis could easily qualify for a ""Best Supporting Actor"" Oscar. Laura Dern's part is small but she also comes across as genuine.

The film crosses racial and economic boundries and some characters were a bit stereotyped. Yet, these same characters were all believable and elicited the appropriate emotional response from me. In other words, nothing was sugar coated

I bought this movie for my dad, a huge football buff and super fan of Remember The Titans (we thought this movie might compare....it didn't), expecting him to love it even more than I would. We both had a 'meh' experience. The movie didn't seem to have any real purpose to it and didn't ever really capture our interest in any big way. There were scenes that just didn't make sense to be in the movie and scenes that were so cringeworthing-ly predictable.

This movie was not enjoyable. The acting was alright. The storyline was all over the place. It's a movie that you should, if you must, rent. Don't buy.",1419724800,,752,4.562962962962963

6566832,4,B00MAMZ17S,"I don't even like football, but I love movies about football. I got this at Christmas and was excited because I love Jim Caviezel and Michael Chicklis. As with all sports movies, the game plays really stressed me out because I want 'my' team to win, but since it's based on a true story, they didn't always. One aspect I especially liked was that the coach teaches the team that it's more important to be good human beings.

They have a couple of tragedies which I hate, but again, it's a true story so what are they going to do but tell what really happened.

There were only two characters I didn't care much for. Chris's father (who is a class A jerk) and Ladouceur's wife. While played well by Laura Dern, there was just something about her... Maybe because it seemed like it was her dream for her husband to coach college ball instead of the high school ball he preferred.

As I said in the first sentence, I love Jim Caviezel and have watched Frequency more times than I can count. Will I watch this movie again? I don't know. It was good, and it held my interest. It touched my heart, made me tear up, and made me laugh and smile. But it still didn't pull me in like Field of Dreams, Remember the Titans, and a few others along those lines. Would I recommend it? Of course. If you like football, you may well love this one. I just liked it.",1419724800,,1347,4.2745098039215685

6566869,4,B00MAMZ17S,"There have been a number of movies based on true life tales that involve football. All of them are inspirational in their own way. It seems as movie goers we must love these tales because each one has done well at the box office, some becoming movie favorites that last forever in the hearts of those who view them. Just added to that list is WHEN THE GAME STANDS TALL. Does it deserve to be on that list? Indeed it does.

The movie is based around the De La Selle High School Spartans, a team that held an incredible winning streak of 151 games undefeated. No other football team, pro or high school, has held a streak to match. And yet the soul of the team is what makes it special. Coach Bob Ladouceur (Jim Caviezel) does want to have a winning team but for him the most important thing is the team itself, the men that these young boys will one day become. It striving for that goal the winning team follows suit.

The film begins with the team on their winning streak and a new season about to start soon. It offers us a glimpse into how the team comes together to form a bonding unit rather than single stars. At the same time we get a glimpse of how a rising star can fall short of the goals the coach sets out to achieve. Its not about that single player but about the team as a whole.

And then two crushing blows come to the team. The first is a heart attack suffered by the coach. Secret cigarette smoking has led him to this and it nearly costs him his life. Its a set back for the team as he works to recover from his illness while his backup coach puts them through the paces that summer as they prepare for next season.

Things go from bad to worse when one of their best players, a young man who has a bright future ahead of him is gunned down. The shooting is the result of his bragging attitude on a basketball court, a gunman who wants to show him hes not all that he thinks he is. The death of this player affects his best friend most, a player who feels that people are dying all around him and he doesnt deserve a chance at a better life. The pair had played together since grade school and been in line to start the next year at Oregon University. But the death also takes its toll on the rest of the team as well.

The coach recovers and takes control of the team once again prior to the new season. But something has happened to them in the meantime. The events of the past few months have become a burden on the team. Coupled with the extra burden of carrying on the tradition of no losses it becomes too much and the team is beaten in their first game. Distraught and disillusioned with the game, they now face a dilemma. Can they regain the glory they once had or are they doomed to failure? More importantly has it all boiled down to making records, to being victorious or is it about brotherhood, bonding together and becoming the men that the coach intended them to be from the start?

Fans of football will love this movie. There is more on field action here than in most movies Ive seen in this genre. At the same time there are the stories of those involved with the team. The coach who has put his family on the back burner for years while getting close with his teams. The son who only wants to have his father in his life as his coach. The young man who feels the weight of having no one left in his life but his little brother and now has the opportunity to move forward. The father who lives so vicariously through his sons achievements that he places more value on the prizes than he does the affections of his child. These characters and their stories make this movie more than just a football film.

Caviezel does a fine job in the lead, showing a maturity that has come with age and is on display in all his moves. Laura Dern as his loving and supportive wife who longs for more time with him is equal to his performance. Michael Chiklis as his right hand man and fellow coach comes through in a pinch when needed. Clancy Brown as the glory seeking father living through his sons achievements is the heel of the film and does it gloriously. And each of the young men playing the team members act as a team as much as the characters they portray. They don't stand out alone but work together to bring the story to life.

The movie is an inspiration as opposed to a look at how football is played. As I said, its about the team and the boys who make up that team on their way to manhood. Knowing that someone like coach Ladouceur was out there helping to form these boys this way gives you hope for the future. What more could you ask for?",1419292800,,4580,4.202502844141069

6566889,3,B00MAMZ17S,"I read the book a few years ago.  I've always been fascinated with the De La Salle football program.  I wanted this movie to be as interesting as the book, but they took way too much creative license with this movie.  A few issues some bad ones (I live about 2 miles from the school and I'm very familiar with the area):  1) The main player (and his father) going for the record isn't real, 2)  The burger hangout isn't in Concord or any of the nearby cities, 3) They briefly show the real school, but use some school in Louisiana for most of the movie, 4)  The Long Beach Poly game was in 2001 (at night) not 2004, and Maurice Jones Drew became a star that game (but isn't mentioned but has a cameo)  5) They show the main football player and his father at a Dick's Sporting goods that opened about a year ago here not 10 years ago it was a movie theater back then. 6)  They have the right team that breaks the streak, but they played it in the stadium where the Seahawks play not Bellevue Highschool.  7)  They should have shown what happened after the streak better.  They started the season 2-3-2 before they went on to win the section final.  That would have been more inspirational 8) They didn't lose to local and excellent program Clayton Valley (they tied).  With all that I really like the commentary and interviews about Coach Lad.  The movie is about a 2 for me and the interviews/insight are a 5.  They don't mention the coach retiring.
