5625214,5,B00BIYQPQU,"As I've discovered, there are myriad creative ways to integrate segments of these 'conversations' into group sessions that are exploring various dimensions of the Universe Story. The interviews serve to inform, inspire, evoke the questions and serve as springboard for yet more conversations of depth and meaning of 'who we are' 'where we've come from' 'how we might respond to the powers of the universe within us' and so on. 'Conversations' is a wonderful contribution to the Great Work unfolding! The DVD 'Journey of the Universe' is a definite prerequisite to 'Conversations' - and it's very helpful that excerpts from this DVD are woven into the thematic organization of 'Conversations.'",1368662400,5,692,5.3
5625215,5,B00BIYQPQU,"The complementary book and film--Journey of the Universe--tell a grand story of 14 billion years and over one hundred billion galaxies, situating Earth and its communities of life, including us humans. Their story weaves together fascinating new scientific discoveries with age-old wisdom that stimulate a desire to know more. I highly recommend this superb DVD series of conversations that help answer to that curiosity at the same time they encourage it to keep growing. I also recommend visiting the Journey of the Universe website where among many other helpful links you will find a curriculum guide with  discussion questions. This guide's bibliography sections are also useful for going deeper into this amazingly vast story: [...]",1368662400,3,738,5.417391304347826
5625216,5,B00BIYQPQU,"""Journey of the Universe"" (the film) is the point of a sword that delivers a message that we as a species need to understand. In the trajectory of great minds like Joseph Campbell, it can change the way you think... permanently.

""Journey of the Universe: Conversations"" is the handle of the the sword. This series takes you deep into the thought processes and understandings of how our universe began and evolved; how our planet came to be, how life took hold and how we as humans stand at an important crossroad. Mary Evelyn Tucker is a spectactular host who takes you through 10 hours of incredible interviews with some of the most insightful and brilliant minds of our time.

I would start with the film first (http://www.amazon.com/Journey-Universe-Film/dp/B00BIYQPVA/ref=sr_1_4?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1362095304&sr=1-4&keywords=journey+of+the+universe) and then after having Brian Swimme provide you with his incredible overview, jump into this interivew series.

It may well change your view of the universe forever.",1362009600,9,1024,5.636363636363637
8569220,5,B00BIYQPQU,"This series of interviews allowed me to experience hope as various speakers presented healthy alternatives to climate change. I found new ways to address my personal lifestyle choices which provide a more sustainable relationship with Earth. Viewing this with groups has led to constructive dialogue, challenging questions and enthusiasm for acting with other environmental groups . I recommend this series as an excellent way to engage a new consciousness of sustainability. It will help those who may be studying the encyclical of Pope Francis, to be released this summer.",1429747200,,574,5.46067415730337
8569221,3,B00BIYQPQU,"The conversations are good, to be sure.  But I was hoping for a little more hard science and a little less ""big picture"" philosophy type science.  Don't get me wrong.  I love a philosophical discussion based on the sciences.  But I wanted to hear about the actual nitty gritty scientific and mathematical details, too.  It can't be everything to everybody, I suppose.  These are more like the kinds of informal conversations people might have over a few beers or shots.",1405728000,,469,4.8
8569222,4,B00BIYQPQU,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this series. The conversations were hit and miss. The first half is wonderful. Mary Evelyn Tucker speaks with some smart scientists about where we all come from, and how exactly we got here. It's a mind-bending story and everyone would benefit from hearing it.

The second half doesn't match the first. In these conversations, Tucker speaks with some community activists about what their are doing to spread the message of the universe story. In most cases, their examples are not that inspiring, and frankly just more of what we've heard in the past. They dance around the really hard problems with vague, feel-good terms and too many references to Thomas Berry.

The Journey of the Universe movie was superb, but if we hope to do justice to that story with real human correction, it will require some serious social criticism. There was no mention of population control or the religious barriers that prevent a new planetary perspective. And perhaps human beings are not the special creatures that we presume ourselves to be. Maybe we are a temporary anomaly on the tree of life -- an accident of evolution and climate shifts. Maybe the journey isn't really about us. What then?",1394668800,,1214,4.859903381642512
8569223,5,B00BIYQPQU,"Journey of the Universe:Conversations comes off my shelf frequently. When I need to take heart at home, when I want to share something evocative with my civic association or faith community, when I visit family and want to entice them with hope and vision. For any of these occasions, I find something remarkable to offer from these Conversations.

There is something here for anyone who cares to be part of the magnificent turning of our human universe toward earth-human justice: inspired stories of work and accomplishment, wondrous discoveries from science, creative expressions of human ingenuity and artistry. I am amazed to find such diverse delights in one library of video conversations.

And Mary Evelyn Tucker is a remarkable interviewer, evoking both simplicity and grandeur from each person's narrative.

Get this for your video shelf and dedicate some time to watching segments: you will never again be at a loss for something to show at a meeting or event. Everyone in your circle will want to be part of Journey of the Universe: Conversations.",1379289600,3,1059,5.109826589595376
8569224,5,B00BIYQPQU,"I originally reviewed the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Journey-of-the-Universe-An-Epic-Story-of-Cosmic-Earth-and-Human-Transformation/dp/B00BIYQPVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Journey of the Universe: An Epic Story of Cosmic, Earth and Human Transformation</a>&nbsp;and raved about it, but at the time I hadn't seen the companion box set of 4 DVDs that constitutes ""Journey of the Universe: Conversations."" I bought it as soon as it came out earlier this month and it has been nightly viewing ever since (there's 10 hours to get through).

It's really an all-star cast of thinkers and academics discussing the many, many ideas crammed into the original film. I could listen to these folks every night for another few weeks, it's that captivating. Host Mary Evelyn Tucker is a great anchor for the series, keeping all of the people she talks with on target with the issues that are raised in the film (clips from the film are shown and then they discuss them).

Superb stuff, Highly Recommended, especially for educators.",1371772800,,1071,6.0394736842105265

8569227,5,B00BIYQPQU,"Five stars are not enough to express my appreciation for this resource.

Since 1977, I have sought to image, describe and conceptualize in easily understandable ways the evolutionary story of how the world came to be. I tried to do this first for myself, a non-scientist, and for other seekers who also longed to understand. The scientific discoveries of the evolution of the Universe are all encompassing, leaving no dimension of human experience unaffected. The writings of Thomas Berry became totally engaging, but there were so few resources for communicating their power. For decades at Genesis Farm, we literally ""cut and pasted"" drawings, charts, timelines, rituals, snippets of films, lectures and images in a constant attempt to grasp, understand and share the enormity of what this ""new cosmology"" was revealing.

At long last, this masterful resource provides the mind and heart with an understandable history of how everything came into being.  Through profound and accessible imagery and narration, it also illuminates the exceptional capacities of Brian Swimme, Mary Evelyn Tucker, John Grim and all their associates to grasp such enormous concepts of time and space as well as the intimacy of our very human selves, bound together in the marvel of existence.  Never do they lose sight of the mystery and meaning so necessary for our human community to take our part in the ongoing journey of life.  The Journey of the Universe film, book, and series of conversations are the vital tools we have needed for laying the foundations of a future worthy of our children.
