8218807,1,B000VI5BXC,The story and acting was very good.  However the quality of the recording was HORRIBLE!!!  The DVDs was burned directly from some damaged very old tape.  The video was extremely poor and the audio just as bad.  It was difficult to watch. WAY TOO MUCH MONEY TO PAY FOR  SUCH A POOR QUALITY DVD.,1468540800,,293,4.351851851851852
