7958560,5,B0000633SF,"Beginning with a very curious long shot and ending with Mishima's over-the-top final scene, Masumura's Afraid to Die is hot and stylish. Although not in the same league as Red Angel, this lively B-movie, which sports an uptempo jazz score and a wry sense of humor, takes you all the way from dealings with the Yakuza to communist rallies to pharmaceutical corruption to abortion clinics and back again. Certainly the legacy of Mishima carries a good deal of the film, and his acting is a bit out there. But, the success of the film I credit to Masumura. He takes so many plots and personalities and delivers them in a wholly entertaining package which at the end makes you want to burst into applause.",1362614400,,701,4.661290322580645
7958561,3,B0000633SF,"I bought this film to add to my collection of the few Mishima-related films that have English subtitles. I was satisfied with it for that purpose, but I would not buy this film as an outstanding example of yakuza films. Other reviews contain enough plot synopsis, in fact almost spoilers! I consider this film a satire in that the closing scene caused a reaction from me that really surprised me, but likely would have disappointed Yukio Mishima. A testament to the skill of the director and the scriptwriter.

If you are a fan of talented actress Ayako Wakao, the abbess in the 2005 film adaptation of Mishima's novel Spring Snow, you might want to acquire this film. The accompanying printed material and excellent transfer to dvd made this a good value.",1292803200,,756,4.770992366412214
7958562,4,B0000633SF,"Clearly, the main draw here is Mishima Yukio.  Famed author of books such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sailor-Who-Fell-From-Grace-with-the-Sea/dp/0679750150/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sailor Who Fell From Grace with the Sea</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spring-Snow/dp/0679722416/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spring Snow</a>; Famed nationalist who saw himself as the last representative of the Samurai spirit, subject of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mishima-A-Life-in-Four-Chapters/dp/B0016AKSOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters</a>&nbsp;and his own film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Patriotism/dp/B0016AKSOQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Patriotism</a>; Living forever in legend for his failed attempt to bravely die by hara-kiri, only to have his skill-less second botch the job.  And here he is in a yakuza flick.

We are all curious to see how well he can act, how well the violent and macho persona of Mishima translates to the screen under the direction of Masumura Yasuzo. Masumura himself, director of such great flicks as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Giants-Toys/dp/B0001A79BW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Giants & Toys</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blind-Beast/dp/B0001A79C6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blind Beast</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Manji/dp/B0001XAKR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Manji</a>, was apprehensive about the author's ability to pull it off.  He was reportedly quite harsh on Mishima, giving him no star treatment and demanding that he put his all into the role.  This thrilled Mishima, who loved both the challenge and the harsh treatment which played to his tough-guy sensibilities, and dove in enthusiastically.

As a movie, ""Afraid to Die"" (""Karakkaze yaro"" or ""The Cold-wind Punk""), isn't exactly a treasure.  Ostentatiously a satire of the yakuza genre, one wonder's if the satire was intentional or if that was tagged on later by advertising people.  The plot is your basic ""Yakuza released from jail needs to take his turf back"" -scenario played out so well in films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wolves/dp/B001B1875C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wolves</a>.  Mishima's character, Takeo, is just a jerk who inherited his position as boss from his father.  Takeo is one of the most unlikable protagonists ever to grace the screen, as he is at times a coward, a bully, a woman beater and a rapist.  Takeo's big plan involves kidnapping the young daughter of a rival and threatening to kill her if he doesn't pay up, and then sneaking abortion pills into his girlfriend's tea when he finds out she is pregnant.  Not exactly a character you are rooting for.

But Masumura is a talented director, however, and manages to pull a good story out of the lackluster script and his non-professional lead actor.  Mishima pulls off the role quite well, and it is interesting that his was willing to sink into such a low character.  He is not exactly a fluid actor, but by no means embarrasses himself.  Wakao Ayako, a regular Masumura actress in films such as Manji and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Angel/dp/B000GI430E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Angel</a>, is her usual beautiful and strong self, the very image of an idealized ""Japanese beauty"" who takes her suffering in silence and still keeps going.  Apparently, she suffered more than her character during her scenes with Mishima, who actually struck her during several scenes and bruised her up fairly badly.  She couldn't have held too much of a grudge however, as she later appeared in an adaptation of Mishima's ""Spring Snow"". Shimura Takashi (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ikiru/dp/B00005JLMU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ikiru</a>, Seven Samurai) lends the film some necessary credibility, and plays a rare tough-guy yakuza role.

Absolutely worth watching, ""Afraid to Die"" is an uneven film that overcomes most of its difficulties and has some real flashes of brilliance.  Masumura's European-influenced camera frames some really nice scenes, especially the climax which is worth the ticket price right there.",1220918400,9,4519,7.078994614003591
7958563,3,B0000633SF,"It's not _bad_, exactly, but I never would have sat through to the end if Mishima hadn't been in it. Overall, I think his performance is pretty solid, and so are the others in the film, but it's not really spectacular; there are better yakuza films out there. Any fan of Mishima should definitely see it, though, for novelty's sake, and bear witness to just how incredibly skinny his legs were.",1079395200,7,394,4.563380281690141
7958564,5,B0000633SF,"I was a bit skeptical of a movie featuring novelist Mishima as an actor, but he carries the lead with a swagger.  Think of a cross between Bogart and Sean Penn.  The story never misses a beat; you will be gripped by its gaudy brilliance right to the end.  Visually, this is an excellent transfer to DVD.  The sound can be a bit muddy at times, but it never distracts.  Great stuff!",1031011200,13,381,4.236111111111111
