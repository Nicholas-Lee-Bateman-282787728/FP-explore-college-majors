7859044,5,6303929516,"The hiilarious character from ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" returns in thre short cartoons wich has basically the same plot; Baby Herman getting into trouble and Roger must save him. But who's gonna save Roger?
Tummy Trouble (1989, Origanlly shown togetter with ""Honey, I shrunk The kids!"")

Trail Mix-up (1990 Shown togetter with ?)
Roger and Baby Herman explores the great pleasure of beign out doors, but when the baby runs away once igain, this time after a beaver, and Roger must rescue him from the dangers of bees, falling trees and a sawmill. [...]'
I highly recommend this video, it's very hard to find today, so thank goodness for Amazon.com for putting this item back on sale. I enjoyed all the three cartoons. It's a shame they don't make more of these cartoons anymore, cause a guy like Roger deserves his own TV series. executive producer Steven Speilberg also makes a funny reference to his famous ""Jaws"" in ""Trail Mix-up""",1034985600,5,1527,4.701492537313433
7859045,5,6303929516,"This three-toon set was issued in 1996 and was off the shelves almost before it landed there. As a Roger Rabbit fan, I missed the short-lived offer - they were gone when I checked the stores, so I bought mine used on an auction site. You are in the right place to buy your copy - you can get them now via Amazon's seller program. Yay!

My understanding is that Disney was getting flack in 1996 for these toons - for being ""non-Disney"" and too adult. Don't worry - who could not love Roger Rabbit and his lovely wife Jessica? Adults will laugh - but they are funny for everyone and nothing to blush over - much!

These are really great toons and worth looking for.",922665600,,663,4.253968253968254
