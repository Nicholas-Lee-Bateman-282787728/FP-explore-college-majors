8225116,5,B000WPJT0K,"Being a vintage collector of classic Television, and Movie productions, I came across these by accident. I first ordered ""Golden Age of Television, Volume 11, mainly for Charles Coburn, I loved it! Fantastic acting, scripts, and overall production, that I found these And more volumes of ""Golden Age of Television""--Both were produced mid 50""s. The main reason why I ordered The Golden Age of
Theater, is mainly my interest seeing Natalie Wood, in a television production, it turns out the same year she did this show was the same year, she did ""Rebel without a Cause"", with James Dean. But also some other greats of ""The 4 Star Theater"", Ronald Reagan, David Niven, Barbara Billingsley, Jack Benny, Ida Lupino, Joan Fontaine, Peter Graves, Ricardo Montalban, Angela Lansbury, Patty McCormack, Russell Johnson, Vincent Price, Charles Boyer, and many more!! I'm really surprised that the other reviewer gave such a poor review with these were superb and top notch talent for that time! To me, some of these stories re-tell historic events as: ""Pochantus"",  watching these, was like seeing an historical event take place, and done very, very well! Some of these shows, even include some of the original advertising! It's really like; going back in time! To me: The television of the past is so much more entertaining and I intellectual stimulating, it's too bad these shows are not aired now, and should be!! And although these shows were before my time, I'd say some of these would be family friendly of mature early teens, if explained and a lot better then much of today's programs, which many I don't understand why and how some of today's Televesion even gets aired?!!?
Anyway, In my opinion I might like the early volumes of ""Theater"", but so far, volume 11, of Golden Age of Televesion is one of the best so far! ""Theater"", as our 80""s US President WAS an actor, I'd say he was a better actor then any you see today! Overall great! And anyone in a television Industry should push for these shows to be aired again!! (Without commercials)!!-Especially shows with Charles Colburn!! He was fantastic!!",1502928000,,2103,4.907303370786517
8225117,3,B000WPJT0K,"24 teleplays from the 1950s, each lasting about 25 mins., are presented on 6 discs. The first disc is a waste of time, the video quality being very poor and the stories uninteresting, but the rest are worthwile with video quality ranging from acceptable to good and interesting stories with a wide range of themes from Pocohontas to being trapped in a room with an unexploded bomb, from a woman whose new hearing aid enables her to overhear private conversations, including that of her murderous husband to a Mexican villager hiding the secret of his unwillingness to work. Presumably a legacy of radio, where drama was popular, the productions have a certain stagey feel, which however does not detract from the excellence of their production, scripting and casting. The principal actors read like a Hollywood who's who including Angela Lansbury, David Niven, Howard Duff, Charles Boyer, Natalie Wood, Edmond O'Brien, Joanne Woodward, Ida Lupino, Vincent Price, Lon Chaney, Joan Fontaine, Macdonald Carey, Ricrado Montalban. The packaging is poor, each disc in it's own case, which takes up shelf space (couldn't they have used a multidisc case or better still slimline cases with a slipcase, which you don't get?). This collection would warrant 4 stars with a better selection on disc one and better packaging but even discounting disc one, you still get 5 discs for $30. PS: if you already have the Four Star Playhouse DVDs, you should note that a few films are duplicated: see list in other review.",1248998400,36,1502,5.012
