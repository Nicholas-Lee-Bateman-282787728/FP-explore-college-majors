1725225,1,B000068MF2,"My 5 year old eagerly awaited this video but was very disappointed when he watched it.  The villian was ""too scary"" for him and it seemed to drag on and on for me as an adult.  I don't recall the TV show as ever having villians like that.  It was always a light hearted sweet show.  Needless to say we won't be viewing this one more than once.",1031961600,,343,4.0
1725226,4,B000068MF2,My two daughters ( age 5 and 1) loved this movie. But for adults it does kind of seem to drag on forever. Thus the 4 instead of 5 star rating.,1030665600,,142,3.6129032258064515
1725227,3,B000068MF2,"This first feature-length Olie video will obviously please children who are fans of this show; it's reminiscent in its plotting of the old Rankin/Bass Christmas specials, with a bad guy who sings to explain the roots of his badness and really just needs cheering up.  (Instead of Paul Frees, he's voiced by no less  than James Woods.)
Adults may feel slightly disconcerted that the very qualities that make the show so suitable for toddlers-- the simple 3-D graphics (more geometric yet no less versatile than Toy Story), the child-sized cast of characters (the Polies live in a world of about 10 people, just like a child does), and the low-key, kid-manageable stories and conflicts-- have been blown up to Hollywood size in a story that's busier, noisier and just generally more dramatic than the TV series.  Rolie Polie Olie has often been a refuge for my family from that kind of kid video.  And then there's the truly bizarre fact (as several people have noted) that the studio dropped the animation's frame rate from a video 30 frames per second (like the TV series) to a film-like 24 fps-- a common enough trick for digital video independent films to make them look more like film, but something that will presumably be lost on most three year olds!  Unfortunately, it means that this video doesn't quite have the seamless look of the TV series itself.
If you're (the parent of) an Olie fan, you will surely add this to your video collection, but if you don't know the show, you're probably better off checking out some of the actual episodes before seeing this bigger, louder, Hollywoodized version.",1030579200,,1607,4.807971014492754
1725228,5,B000068MF2,"our whole family (daughter 12, son 2) thoroughly enjoyed ""the great defender of fun"".  we're long time olie fans  - the characters and animation style have always been favorites - and the movie didn't let us down one bit.  (we thought we recognized several names from the tv show.)  james woods was great.  thanks to all involved.",1030492800,,330,4.719298245614035
1725229,5,B000068MF2,"I disagree with the person who found the frames choppy.  I found the animation somewhat smoother and the 3D rendering more developed than the TV version.
We love Olie at our house.  The characters are vivid and unique, the old-fashioned/futuristic style is great, and the music is terrific.  Our daughter loves this and wants to see it every day.  She's 2 and a half and hasn't been scared by ""Gloomy"" as she calls him.  We think this film is excellent.",1030320000,4,453,4.6125
1725230,4,B000068MF2,"My 3.5 yr old daughter, who has loved Rolie Polie Olie forever, and who owns all the videos, loved the movie. It didn't scare her at all. I thought that Spookie Ookie was a more frightening character than Gloomius Maximus, but neither ever bothered her. This from child who won't watch Toy Story 2 because she's afraid of Zurg.
The quality of the graphics looks different, almost like they filmed it instead of using video - if that can make sense. It's not as crisp, but it's just fine for a toddler (remember, it's not made for us digital freaks!) :-)
I read comments regarding the style of the writing/story line. Nothing like that was readily apparent to me, just as it wasn't to my daughter (at least she didn't make any such observation - that'd really be something! and she can read some - so she's no dummy). :-)
I say that, if your child is a Rolie Polie Olie fan, they'll like the movie. You may not want to invest in a DVD since the quality isn't really as good as typical digital video, but you could also just keep that in mind.
Enjoy! :-)",1030233600,6,1052,4.345177664974619
1725231,3,B000068MF2,"My soon to be 3 year old loves Rolie Polie Olie since the first time he the show on Playhouse Disney.  The picture quality of the movie was great but the frames were too choppy and it gives your eyes a workout just to watch.  The evil gloomius didn't scare my son too much but he was wondering who he was because this character was not introduced before.  When he mentions him it is always who is the green scary guy?  Overall, I think this movie was ok.",1029888000,,454,4.125
1725232,5,B000068MF2,"My kids and i love to watch Playhouse Disney in the morning
were Rolie Polie is pretty much are morning entertainment. I
was happy to see Rolie Polie put to a full feature presentation.
I'm glad to see it was a hit with my kids, they've watched it at
least four times already.  I was at first a little worried It
would take a detour from the family qualities of the morning show, but it didn't in my opinion.  At times Gloomius could seem
frightening but it was done in a light hearted way. When happy
bubbles come from a gun to make you feel good inside is alright
with me...! Good Show",1029628800,6,587,4.185840707964601
1725233,2,B000068MF2,"If you are looking for what we've come to expect from the ""Rolie Polie"" gang, look again. My 2-1/2 year old is a big fan of ""Rolie Polie Olie"" and was very disappointed in this movie. The animation, for some reason, has lost its computer-generated fluidity and is a jittery headache to watch and the usual slow-paced and charming writing is gone and been replaced with your standard good guy/bad guy conflict and lots of frenetic racing around. Everytime ""Gloomius Maximus"" came on, my daughter asked me to fast forward it because he scared her. Eventually, my daughter picked up one of her books and wandered off... Hmm...",1029196800,,623,4.777777777777778

1725250,4,B000068MF2,"We like this, but there are things in it that are not good for young kids or five-year-olds who are very impressionable. The one line my 4 and 5year olds have picked up and keep saying to us now....I feel better when you feel worse....is not something you want your child to get into. It comes from the villain who is trying to take all the fun away...a fine principle, however kids pick up phrases like that really easily.

1725258,3,B000068MF2,"I absolutely adored the Rolie Polie Olie era of Playhouse Disney and watched it regularly with my older son.  I had hoped for the same great quality for my younger son's learning and entertainment but was sadly disappointed with the currently programming on Disney for toddlers.  I purchased this video to give the little one an opportunity to enjoy the show as my older son had, but was not aware of the introduction of another character, Gloomius Maximus.  My son has gotten used to him after watching several times, but it was certainly an adjustment period and I don't think any Mom likes hearing her little one say something is causing him to be scared.  He kept insisting that I play it because he really likes RPO, however.  Also, the fun-loving storyline in most of the Rolie Polie Olie episodes seems largely lost here as well as the usual setting which I found much more colorful and comforting.  In short, I would definitely purchase another RPO video for a younger child.  The only thing I really liked about this video was RPO himself!  If you are thinking of purchasing this video for the reasons that endeared you to the original series, I'd DEFINITELY suggest another video instead...",1313712000,,1200,4.763285024154589

The younger child did not have the joy of watching the series on TV, it had been lost in the shuffle of newer programming. :(  This film keeps his attention while he and his brother sit side by side, making comments and cheering for the good guys. It illustrates intolerance and understanding from a child's perspective.  Good film.",1239494400,,504,4.516483516483516

He watched it for the first time about six months ago and has been building ray guns to ""gloom"" and ""ungloom"" us ever since.  It has really engaged his imagination.  He pretends about rockets, pirates and robots.  It started him asking questions about space and real rockets.  One day he even organized his whole pre-school class to play ""galaxy"" - a game he made up about rockets and planets - while on the playground.  He can take or leave the TV show, but this is his favorite thing to watch on TV.",1161907200,,575,4.419047619047619
1725267,5,B000068MF2,"We bought this DVD in desperation while on a LONG road trip for our 20 month old.  We hooked up the laptop and played the DVD for her while on the road and it was a LIFESAVER!!  We bought 4 different movies and she wanted THIS one played over and over.  It really is a cute movie and I love the Olie family.
I love that the characters always remain positive and ""can-do"", there isn't any violence (the worst is when Gloomious takes a toy from a child), and it's all about having fun.
Now that we are home, I am limiting her to watching it once a day, but TRUST me...she could watch it completely mesmerized over and over and over....

1725271,5,B000068MF2,"I find this DVD to be ""cute"", but not in the sickening way that Barney or the freakin' Teletubbies are cute.  I was not surprised to learn that the Rolie Polie Olie series was made in Canada...things seem to be neater and cleaner north of the border (see 'Canadian Bacon' if you don't know what I mean).  for some reason the 'Leave It To Beaver' lifestyle still thrives up in the Great White North.
But the bottom line here folks is my 2 1/2-yr-old loves this DVD, and you can't trust an adult critic to understand what this movie is all about.  I am amazed at the accent James Woods puts on for Gloomy, I thought it was Bob Hoskins!  The characters are cute, the plot interesting enough to hold a young child's imagination and attention, and overall I think (and my youngest son seems to agree) that this is a great kids movie.  It just proves that you don't need to be sugary-sweet or overcompensate with glitzy special effects to win kids over.  A well thought out plot, a positive attitude, and some bright colors will do the trick.  Ranks up there with 'Veggie Tales' for family entertainment",1036972800,3,1097,4.482412060301508
