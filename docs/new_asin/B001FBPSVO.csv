3584188,5,B001FBPSVO,"self hypnosis is presented in a simple, yet detailed way that is understandable for people new to self hypnosis and those of us that have used it for many years. It gives you detailed information on what to expect and how to work with the program.",1287792000,3,247,4.391304347826087
3584189,5,B001FBPSVO,"I am impressed.
1st of all I started about 2 weeks ago listened for a couple days with possitve results.
Then stopped just because I didn't fit it into my busy life. I found my self having that craving to eat crazy at night coming back, But I wasn't eating junk at work.
Something negative happened in my life and I lost it! I had a total eat fest after everyone was in bed.
I have listened for 3 days now and what impresses me most is how the program works with the way you are using food to feel good. It is calming, helping you focus on your strengths, abilities as your comfort instead of food.
If I don't loose a ton of weight, I will still love this tape for the calm strength it helps me find within.

3584190,4,B001FBPSVO,"I'm a forming D1 jumper and runner who's metabolism has slowed in my later years. I'm currently finishing up my B.S. in psychology, and hope to become a hypnotherapist. I do find this video very relaxing, even with her accent. It does take some time when listening to any hypnotherapy video to get used to the people who try and make there voices deeper, but it comes off more calming than the guys who just creep me out. I actually enjoyed the information presented her about portions, and felt it necessary for people to understand that part before they can be hypnotized into doing that part. But i can see where someone who already understands this, would be put off. The dvd does allow you to skip the informative part and jump into the hypnosis, but if you don't have the knowledge of what your trying to do, it will not work, so you need to watch and understand the first part at least once. I do fault the dvd for having such a long start up. every time you put it in, it has a very long intro, that i have yet to be able to skip. So i have to start the dvd well before i want to use it.

After watching it just once, i ate less food, because i wanted to. I wanted to watch the video again, and did so. I even hit the gym harder than usual. I wouldn't say the video ""caused"" me to perform better, but it did help. after a few days however, i stopped watching the dvd, because of the stupid super long intro. I'm currently attempting to find a way to convert the hypnosis part to mp3 format. I would suggest that others buy the dvd, but use an audio track after that.",1266624000,11,1574,4.177631578947368

3584192,4,B001FBPSVO,"I founfd this helpful, relaxing and somewhat successful so far.  I wish the actual hypnosis part was longer. There are 5 sections, parts 1-4 being somewhat repetative in describing the program (and using the same video footage over and over).  Part 5 has been effective for will power and cravings and improved eating habits (about 10 minutes long).  I wish it also included motivation to exercise as the testimonial by some Brittish star on the cover implies.",1238198400,15,460,4.9480519480519485

8301835,3,B001FBPSVO,"This DVD does provide the power to lose weight but after growing up spiritually over the years, I've grown to believe that this is another form of supernatural forces that is not of the Most High Jesus Christ. If you research hypnosis, you will find that it is a work of the occult where spirit forces take over the mind, making one unconscious of what is happening which is almost like how witches casts spells upon people within the occult world. Therefore, I am very conscience and particular with what I put in my mind. However, if anyone wants to truly lose weight, I prefer reputable HCG shots which helps restructure the internal chemistry of the body to where you have a normal appetite, no uncontrollable cravings and lose about a pound a day throughout the process to where you reach your desired goal from which the weight does not come back for a long time. It can be expensive, but like with anything, you get what you pay for.",1428883200,,940,4.535294117647059
8301836,3,B001FBPSVO,"Not too bad, the voice is a female with a british accent, it does work if you listen to it daily, but not my favorite, I would perfer a male voice for this type of product. Makes you fall asleep, took a long time before I heard the whole thing.",1408752000,3,244,3.9
8301837,5,B001FBPSVO,"I started this off as a bit of a despirate attempt at dropping a few pounds before the big summer bash we are going to. When you start you may not think it is working but it is. I fell of the wagon for a week while we had visitors and found that once that happened I went backwards to my old habits. Yes it works, but you must stick at it and after a couple of weeks you will suddenly notice that you are not going for cookies but for water. Hang in there and watch the pounds melt.",1373328000,5,482,3.83
8301838,5,B001FBPSVO,"I originally checked this dvd out from my local library, and will buy it now. Susan Hepburn has a voice that is very easy to listen to, unlike some others I have tried. I find the program (or programme) quite helpful to me.

My only quibble is that I would like to put the 10 minute hypnosis session onto my iPod so I am not stuck sitting in front of my tv or computer while the dvd plays -- I don't need the visuals at that point. If I can figure that out, I'll be even happier.",1365552000,,479,3.9381443298969074
