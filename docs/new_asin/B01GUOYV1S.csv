8763579,4,B01GUOYV1S,"An absolutely unthinkable premise nearly destroys a person's sense of moral balance and offers no hope. The killer and his pursuers are doomed, the indignities are shocking, and the amazing soundtrack drowns everything in so many synthesizer stingers and drones and theramin dementia, you barely get out alive. Absolutely no restraint in the movie's offensive language and epithets. Those looking for ""Scream"" or any other gentrified police procedural look elsewhere.",1512604800,,467,5.685714285714286
