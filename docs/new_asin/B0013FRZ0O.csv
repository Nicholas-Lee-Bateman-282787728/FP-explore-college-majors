8306465,3,B0013FRZ0O,"I purchased this double feature as a fan of genre films, especially the kind of the so-called Nazisploitation genre and as such, I could not fail to get hold of the title which gives the name to this collection, Slave Girls of the SS, film of which I had never heard before.

I watched it as soon as the postman arrived and I must say that I was quite disconcerted: in practice is a pale excuse for a sex comedy in Nazi sauce, with a ludicrous plot and characters that are more like caricatures, stuffed every three by two paces with sex scenes that define ""hard"" according to today's standards is a mere utopia.

Among other things, when I realized that it was actually a little porn movie from the 70s, I was even more dumbfounded, especially because the actresses / models - which in a production like this should rightly be significant - are rather cheesy enough: they are nice girls, that's all, but far removed from the standards you would expect from adult entertainment's models.

Overall it is a fun little film but little more and to me that are not a native English speakers, the fact that it was devoid of subtitles made the vision even more difficult attempting to understand the dialogues (which oddly enough for a film of this kind, abound), especially because all the male characters, as good Nazis, show a terrible deutsche-like accent.

But what puzzled me was the use - at the beginning and end of the film - of original archive footage of World War II; I mean, a finesse such as this seems really out of place in a film that, for the rest, from the costumes to the settings, it seems (and probably is) pulled away and shot on a shoestring.",1358467200,,1659,4.483443708609271

8306468,1,B0013FRZ0O,"Being a huge fan of grindhouse cinema, cult, sex and exploitation flicks, I assumed this to be of essential viewing, and therein lays my grievous error. As a sub-genre of exploitation, nazisploitation has its merits as well, because most of it's so bad it's hysterical - not unlike 'Hogan's Heroes' with an absence of political correctness and copious amounts of nudity. Couple this character flaw with my appreciation of Rene Bond, and it appeared a no-brainer. This too, was true. No brains...

Well, 'Slave Girls of the SS' was abominable, but what made the horrid absolutely unwatchable was the print - it'll give you glaucoma before it's over, if not full-blown macro-degeneration. Be warned.

So, now I'm praying to the gods of all things perverse that the presence of Rene Bond will single-handedly (she can even use both hands - brother, can she...) salvage 'Woman of Vengeance' from the abyss I've just returned from after the first debacle and here too, I'm proven incorrect. When all your bets are hedged that the first family of free-love and fornication (Rene and real-life partner Rick Lutze) will save a made-in-one-day movie from the bowels of boredom, boy is that deck stacked against you. This one is a bore and complete disappointment, unfortunately.

The best thing about Retro-Seduction releases are the 'After Hours Trailer Vaults' - aside from these, each and every release I've suffered through was a complete waste of time and cash. But as bad as these old flicks are, the newer releases with 'stars' like Darian Caine and Misty Mundae (Mundane) are even worse, and that's hard to fathom. There's a ton of old-school grindhouse stuff to re-visit and enjoy with a teary eye, but none of this stuff on Amazon makes the grade - if you find one that does, contact me via my profile page - I'd love to be incorrect about something  beneficial for a change...",1285632000,3,1878,4.877742946708464
