2755078,5,B000N3STWA,"I really liked this doc because the filmmakers made themselves pretty transparent and really let the rider and riders come through. The music was also tasteful and excellent. One point about the bikes these guys were riding; others have commented that it's older equipment, which it is, but those are some gorgeous, classic bikes. And wool jerseys.",1329004800,2,348,5.12280701754386

2755080,4,B000N3STWA,I've run & biked (slowly) over the cobblestones in many areas of europe & they don't seem dangerous until a little slick. Made me appreciate the dangers the racers face when the conditions get bad & they have to go forward.,1285200000,,223,4.463414634146342
2755081,5,B000N3STWA,"Yes, this is one of the best cycling movies ever made.  Gives you an idea of the difficulty of the ride and the equipment used at that time.  Excitement, drama, social commentary.",1277683200,5,179,4.5625
2755082,5,B000N3STWA,"I first saw this movie at the theater.  It played at an art house theater.  The dark and gritty documentary appealed to the art house crowd as much as it did to cyclists.

This is a video about bicycle racing before million dollar contracts and the glamor and glitz we see today.  The bikes were made of steel as were the men who rode them.  Bike racers didn't jet all over the world with their rock star girlfriends back then; they had a job to do and earned every scrap of money and respect they got.  A brutal race over a brutal race course.

Watch this video if you want to see a snapshot of what professional bike racing was like back then.",1266969600,4,645,4.195121951219512
2755083,5,B000N3STWA,"Paris Boubaix is the most famous of the cyclings ""Spring Classics"" one day races.  What makes this race particularly amazing are the cobblestones that shake the the bike, the body and the mind.  This film is follows the 1976 race. Luckily for the riders and the film makers it was a beautiful, sunny, early spring day. You see Eddie Merchx (the greatest rider of the 20th Century), Roger De Vlaeminck in the famous Brooklyn Chewing Gum jersey, Martens and others. The photography, narration and most of all the music are absolutely brilliant. The scenes of the exhausted riders in the showers at the end of the race is both heartbreaking and inspirational. The film was make by the Dutch filmmaker Jorgen Leth and is a must for every rider's film library. RIDE HARD AND RIDE SMART.",1262390400,5,781,4.735294117647059

8174576,4,B000N3STWA,"Jorgen Leth's film takes us back to the 1976 Paris-Roubaix spring classic cycle race, notable for its cobbled streets which were seldom used - except for this race. The film concentrates on several of the stars of the time, including Eddy Merckx and the then up-and-coming star Freddy Maertens. With commentary provided by the late David Saunders, at the time the major figure in cycling journalism, A SUMMER Sunday IN HELL is a treat for cycling nostalgics. However Leth transforms the event into something more than just a race: through skillful use of different types of shot - close-ups, aerial shots of the pack of racers passing through chocolate-box French towns, slow-motion shots - he makes aware of the aesthetic beauty of the event. To watch racers passing through streets in geometric shapes, or to watch an individual cyclist pedaling so hard like an automaton, is to understand why the sport exerts such a fascination for mass audiences. Leth is also concerned with the race as a social occasion: we see several shots of spectators passing the time in bars by singing, drinking, or eating; or small groups of village people passing the time of day on a glorious summer's day; or panning shots of spectators lining the route and cheering as the cyclists speed by. The film is a social history of the time, showing the hair-styles, clothes and mannerisms characteristic of the mid-Seventies. Saunders' commentary is sparse; on several occasions all we hear are the cyclists, their team-members and other officials talking in a variety of languages - French, Flemish, Italian. No subtitles are provided; but this is deliberate, as Leth wants to emphasize the internationality of the occasion, that contrasts with the rural settings in which the race takes place. The world of professional cycling was (and still is) a self-enclosed world, whose riders move from race to race; they live in a sporting bubble, which takes little or no account of the different venues in which the events take place. Unlike the spectators watching the event, the cyclists themselves are divorced from the 'real' world of daily life. A SUMMER Sunday IN HELL is a fascinating sociological document that works on several levels. Definitely worth a look.",1405555200,3,2241,5.0431266846361185

8174578,5,B000N3STWA,"Filmmaker Jorgen Leth produced two cycling documentaries in the 70's: Stars and Watercarriers, which followed the 1974 Tour of Italy, and this one, A Sunday in Hell, which documents the 1976 Paris Roubaix one day 'Classic' race also known as ""The Hell of The North"".

Before Breaking Away and American Flyers, this documentary was the first movie to introduce the world of Professional Cycling to a wider audience, and the first to explain the many nuances that make up a bicycle race, from the racers all the way down to the support staff. There isn't a better race to follow than Paris Roubaix, which has been held since 1896.

These were the Racers of an earlier generation, who relied on strength and guile to carry them on mile after mile, alternately rolling between smooth road and the pav, the bread loaf sized cobblestoned roads that make up  of the race.

In the Cycling Community, this movie is legendary, for it has been the inspiration for thousands of cyclists, bike mechanics and cycling fans all over the world, and continues to be. Just watch the first three minutes of the movie, which has been called by many ""The most eloquent bike cleaning ever filmed""... and you'll see why.",1403827200,,1196,4.763285024154589
8174579,3,B000N3STWA,"I am a pretty die-hard cyclist.  I think this film was less exciting that watching an actual P-R race and probably overhyped b/c it's got Eddy Mercx in it.  per other comments, it doesn't really show the suffering that well (i expected it to be an epic ride with many exciting episodes - nope, just a four-up sprint finish, with very unexciting splits that develop in the race).  Very little excitement, very non-chalant updates on the race situation (monotone the whole time).  It was interesting on a few levels, but no comparison to Hell on Wheels, which was a much more in-depth film on riding the tour.  I'd rather watch a replay of a real paris-roubaix.",1393459200,,659,4.646551724137931

8174581,5,B000N3STWA,"Not much has changed in the Paris Roubaix race since the 1970's; this documentary of the 1976 Paris Roubaix race is still entertaining, & a must for any avid bike racing fan's library.",1364428800,,184,4.606060606060606
8174582,3,B000N3STWA,"this is a cyclists film. i have a lot of respect for serious cyclists and serious athletes of any kind. to the serious cyclist, no doubt it is compelling.  to the non-cyclist or casual cyclist it lacks power. considering every legit review here is 5 stars, it is unlikely my review will be appreciated but i will throw it in the ring.
documentary film and more broadly film, is a visual medium. you want to show as much as possible, you don't 'tell'.  when you try to tell a story where you have to constantly tell the viewer what is happening, you are going to lose something. the primary issues that detracted for me:
-primarily the 'hell' aspect of the title, repeated many times by the narrator (hell is on its way) builds an expectation of major suffering to be reckoned with.  i was never quite sure when it happened.  the case of a poor road condition/surface that is avoided whenever able may truly be hell for those riding it, but the film never really conveys that effectively.  if the road is the antagonist, i never felt it.  i have seen many roadraces where there are pileups,lacerations and bent cycles.  that can happen anywhere anytime. had the film not built this aspect of it up so much i likely would have not been waiting for 'it' to happen.
-the lack of subtitles when the actual folks talking speak is a huge loss.  that could actually be laid down in a re-edit and would improve the film
-narration style very dry, but that was par for the course for a very long time in older doc films.
-i was never given an opportunity to care about the riders ,because the documentary never allowed us to get to know a thing about most of them.  interviews conducted and inter-cut, replacing some of the narrator would have elevated the film many notches.  with that said, the fellow who's OCD regarding bike is an example, had it been extended to others would have been great
-it would have been more effective as a 1 hour show.
what i liked:
-vintage footage.  some of the cinematography was quite good.
-the cars/motorbikes give an incredibly chaotic and almost claustrophobic feel to the race.  i kept wanting to yell at the telly 'get the hell out of their way, and quit kicking all that dust up in their faces!' arrgh!
-the hardmen from a time gone by.  it wasn't about the bike or technology.  it was about the rider and the rid.
i know this i a film about this specific race, this year.  for committed cyclists no doubt it is a classic.  for the rest of us it is just a slow slog with a few good moments.  very little drama due to not allowing us to hitch our wagons to the subjects.  fwiw, i am a casual/moderate year round cyclist and have produced several doc films.
i am glad this film exists for the community, it was given to me to watch by a friend who is a bike shop owner/mens pro elite racer- he was very enthusiastic about it and i went into it with great expectations.  cheers.",1335312000,7,2907,4.410112359550562
