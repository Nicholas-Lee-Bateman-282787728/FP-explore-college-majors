2637832,5,B000HFKOBS,"I absolutely love this video.  It's a 20 minute video that targets only your upper body.  It is very challenging.  When I first began the video, I had to put down my weights for a couple of the excercises, but now I can make it all the way through.

This video begins with 10 minutes of pilates infused mat workout with either 1 or 2 lb weights, and 10 minutes of standing arm excercises.  I have seen a huge difference in my arms.  They are more toned and stronger.  I love this video!",1153094400,9,486,4.161290322580645
2637833,4,B000HFKOBS,"The DVD arrived quickly, and it appeared to be in excellent condition.  When I first played it, I noticed that it skips for a couple of seconds at the very beginning, but works well otherwise.  I like the workout!",1416268800,,213,4.435897435897436
2637834,5,B000HFKOBS,"I had been doing Lotte Berk and Core Fusion for a number or years, but not getting the results I wanted--long, lean muscles without a lot of strain. Well, this DVD delivers just that, plus you get to work your abs at the same time. At first when I did this DVD I was skeptical because I didn't feel the ""burn"", but after sticking to it for a couple months, I saw and felt the lean muscle develop. I also have sensitive wrists, and I found that using 2 lb hand weights didn't cause any problems. Definitely recommend this workout.",1415836800,2,529,4.3

I am not sure if it dramatically changed the appearance of my arms, but I think I will keep working on it.  It sure sweats me and I combine with 20 minutes Pilates or advanced body slimming DVD.  And I like it.",1409788800,,309,3.857142857142857

2637841,3,B000HFKOBS,"I was happy to find a good quality copy of this workout. It arrived quickly and in good condition.
The workout itself however was not really worth my quest for a good pilates style upper body workout. It almost seemed like some chintzy workout form a magazine using soup cans for weights. That's not what you do in this workout but you may as well.",1400457600,,348,4.369230769230769

2637845,5,B000HFKOBS,"I started with the Windsor abs DVD and love it, so I decided to try the upper body too.  It also incorporates ab work, or ""core"" work too.  A good, solid workout that won't bulk you up.  I like these because they are quick and you can pop them in and just get in a good workout, but not take up a lot of time.",1363737600,4,309,3.723076923076923
2637846,5,B000HFKOBS,"No issues with purchasing, shipping/packaging, and product. The video itself is okay. I would prefer to stick with the other DVDs in the series and work on my own for arm workouts. It does not feel like a workout even with 8# dumbbells.",1357516800,,236,4.511627906976744
2637847,4,B000HFKOBS,i found this to be a good buy and would purchase again. i am a beginner and found that it was challanging enough but not out of my league,1356566400,4,137,3.7586206896551726
2637848,5,B000HFKOBS,"I am not an exercise buff and neither do I spend an inordinate amount of time in the gym, in fact I do most of my workouts at home using dvds or going on the treadmill, I found Upper Body Sculpting to be functional ie. working the upper body area  for a relativley short duration, about 20 mins, not too easy to do but neither so difficult as to be frustrating and best of all you have a sense of improvement following each workout.",1355702400,3,432,4.142857142857143

2637850,5,B000HFKOBS,"I loveee this video.  It really has toned my arms.  I am not a fanatic of weight training at a gym;it's silly to me these days.  This video really sculpts your arms and MARI WINSOR;as always: ""DELIVERS."" She talks to you and counts the breathing so you don't have to be looking at the tv in case you missed or forgot a movement.  I love the music, I love how Mari Winsor guides you! I am so glad I purchased this! I purchased this awhile ago and I knew I needed to leave a review, a good one;for that matter.  If you do this 3 times a week;at least, plus exercise on a regular basis and moderate yourself with good healthy eating, you will be toned in no time.  Be consistent with this;it WORKS!",1321315200,4,695,4.149253731343284

2637852,5,B000HFKOBS,"Description from the back of the DVD, followed by my review...

""Mari Winsor's Upper Body Sculpting video is designed to help tone and shape your arms, shoulders and upper back, all while working your powerhouse at the same time.  Mari has helped some of Hollywood's biggest stars get arms and upper body and now you too can learn her secrets.  All you need to do this special workout is a set of dumbbells.

This workout is a series of choreographed movies, whether a beginner or advanced.  This modular workout system allows you to tailor your workout based upon your level of physical fitness, endurance and sensitivities, so you can build and get get stronger.  With only three consistent workouts a week, you will not only change your body, you will change your life.

Mari Winsor has taken proven Pilates moves to a whole new level using her exclusive dynamic sequencing technique.  A low intensity, calorie-burning workout that can help you lose unwanted pounds and inches, her dynamic sequencing technique firms, strengthens and tones more muscles than ordinary workouts.  The result is a sleeker, more sculpted body in just minutes a day.""

I really enjoy this workout.  Mari recommends 1 or 2 pound weights, but says even if you don't use weights you will see results.  I started out with no weights, and still worked up a sweat.  After a couple of weeks, I started using 1pounds, and started seeing results even quicker.  I love that the whole body is involved in the workout as opposed to moves like static bicep curls.  You keep your buttocks tight to maintain stability, you are stretching your back and legs, and you are working out the powerhouse.  Great quick workout!",1312848000,7,1685,4.839160839160839
2637853,5,B000HFKOBS,OMG! This workout is AMAZING! Not only has it made my upper body stronger BUT it has tightened my pectoral muscles (I'm a girl) and it lifted my breasts AMAZINGLY!

2637858,5,B000HFKOBS,"I own several Winsor Pilates DVDs and I love them!  Pilates gives you a great workout--you'll definitely feel it and you'll see a difference.  It works your entire upper body.  You use Pilates poses and light weights.

I used this DVD and one of the Winsor buns & thighs workouts every other day--and did the 20-minute workout on the other days. I not only built muscle and saw my body shape change but I felt much more relaxed and balanced througout the day. I noticed and missed it) on days I skipped. The breathing and simple nature of the exercises, although they're strenuous, are very calming. It also explains modifications for those of us who have sensitive areas or aren't quite as limber as the people on the DVD!

I've since switched to a different workout routine as I had an old injury that I was irritating with the daily core work.  I miss Pilates and am going to reincorporate it into my workouts--especially the Upper Body Sculpting workout.",1260316800,14,958,4.6390532544378695

2637862,5,B000HFKOBS,"I love these DVD's. Why? because I worked out so much that I was very toned every where except in my problem tummy area.  My thighs, calves, back, buttocks were extremely toned. People would always ask me how I got my legs so toned, when I told them I was careful to hold in my tummy. Nothing fully worked on my mid-section which I worked on for four years until I purchased this set and really concentrated on my abs with the Abs DVD (my powerhouse as Windsor Pilates calls it.) It is basic enough for the beginner but was not too basic for someone who works out 4 to 5 days per week. IT WORKED and I am no longer frustrated with my midsection, finally I saw results with Windsor Pilates.  It help tone those muscles that were weakened after having two babies.  I also got a lot of results with my inner thighs using the provided resistance band.

8139698,2,B000HFKOBS,This is too easy. Its not challenging enough to change your body. I did it over a number of weeks with no results. I think its gotten a lot of hype because Miley Cyrus goes to her classes. But Miley C.also has a nutritionist and personalized meals catered for her. Whatever. This is crap.,1502236800,,288,4.351851851851852

a simpler short program with just  floor pilates with no weights will enable you to gently tone and stretch out

8139700,5,B000HFKOBS,"Mari Windsor is my favorite form of exercise. I danced ballet for 11 years, so my body responds well to these types of exercises. Her sequences are well thought out and you can feel the difference after the first week or 2.",1471996800,,223,4.333333333333333

8139702,5,B000HFKOBS,"A great upper body workout.  I got into Windsor Pilates back in the early 00's off an infomercial.  I had a full set of her VHS.  LOL  They really work.  I re-bought everything in DVD format and keep going back to them as all-time faves.  These early videos (maybe her first videos) from Guthy-Renker are really the best.  No props, just mat Pilates choreographed into routines that will change the shape of your body if you do them consistently.  Lively instruction makes them easy to follow.  I fall in and out of working out regularly, but I always circle back to my old Windsor Pilates.

But back to t his workout...I was skeptical when I first started doing it.  It seems a bit easy and the weights are light.  But it does the job.  Worth noting is that although Mari says don't use more than 2lb weights, I use 3lbs for the mat part of this workout and then 5lb for the standing up part.  Makes it work quicker.  But don't even think about trying that until you're in shape and you've been doing it a while.  The heavier weights change your ergonomics and could cause injury if you're not very careful.",1455667200,2,1108,4.410891089108911
