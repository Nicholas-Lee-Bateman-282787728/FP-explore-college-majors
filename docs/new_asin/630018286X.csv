215669,5,630018286X,"A perfect horror film with a sexy,steamy side. The actors are great in their roles, the cat f/x are cool,the romance is haunting. A great twist at the end of the movie. Malcolm McDowell is disturbing and twisted but delivers a good role. Nastassja Is perfect for her part the setting is also perfect. Highly recommendable!",973123200,3,322,4.767857142857143
215670,4,630018286X,"""Cat People"" has two things going for it:  a creepy, intriguing story line; and Nastassia Kinski.  Kinski is absolutely mesmerizing in the  title role; an erotic, exotic presence awakening to her own sexuality and  discovering that she can only have a life with one of her own kind.  Paul  Schrader's direction lends a eerily spooky atmosphere to the film.  Malcolm  McDowell is excellent as Kinski's brother who sees her as his only  salvation, as she sees him as her destruction; John Heard is okay but  nothing special as Kinski's lover who finally realizes what she is and  commits the act that at once sets her free and imprisons her for the rest  of her life; and Ruby Dee has a small but haunting role as the landlady who  knows Kinski's secret and confronts her with the devastating reality of  what lies ahead for her.  There's plenty of blood and plenty of gore, but  it all fits in with the story.  It's not a great movie, but it's a very  good one that deserves a wider audience.",966988800,28,991,4.534090909090909
215671,5,630018286X,"Cat People was hit with comparisons to the 1942 original and that, as usual, is unfair. The two have barely a thing in common. Yes, the 80s version has plenty of sex and violence, but so be it, the film has a well-defined look and is certainly moody and atmospheric, which is all we can ask of a horror film so many times.

Unlike the original's psychological horror and hammy acting, Schrader is concerned with establishing New Orleans as a bizarre setting for this strange tale of a young woman's sexual awakening and subsequent rampage as a member of the title race. Kinski is perfect in the role as is Heard as Oliver, and McDowell is on hand for his patented creepiness. This film represents a clear vision of the horror only hinted at in the original screenplay by DeWitt Bodeen, and with Scarfioti and Moroder doing the visuals and the music, it's a slick, sexy film.

This '02 DVD finally gives us some extras, and cleans the picture and sound up for DVD, highlighting the camera work and the Moroder score.  A good horror film from an interesting director, I have no doubt Cat People will be revisited for another remake soon.",956534400,,1135,4.58128078817734
215672,5,630018286X,"Whener I am just fishing around for some film to kill the time, I often turn to my DVD of Cat People. I think it's really quite scary and Nataja Kinsky slinking around in the nude is somwthing else.  As a final touch,  she ends up tied up in bed with John Heard doing her the favor she asks  for.  What more could you ask?
Unforunately, the DVD has no special  features at all, not even the trailers.  But it is a high quality transfer.",950745600,3,436,4.070588235294117
215673,4,630018286X,"The sex scenes and violence may look tame by todays standards, but that doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the film. The ""cat people"" is different kind of horror movie. Think of ""an American  werewolf in London"" without the comedy. It is engoyable from the  opening credits to the end credits. (both are rolling while David Bowie's  fitting tital song plays)",949968000,,363,4.82258064516129
215674,4,630018286X,I first saw this movie when it released in theaters.  The movie made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end.  The storyline is very good and the camara work is excellant!  This is a movie that I watch almost every  time it comes on. The only negative (why I did not give five stars) is that  the movie did not delve deeper into how the Cat People came to be.  I would  have liked to have seen more about where they came from.  Otherwise I  highly recommend this movie.,948585600,,474,4.010752688172043
215675,5,630018286X,"One of the best of the 1940's era horror films highlighted by Val Lewton's use of shadow and understated horror.  Produced by Lewton, this film, the Wolf Man, and Dead of Night rank as the best horror films from the lean  1940's.  Directed by Jacquest Tourneur (Curse of the Demon) and starring  the sexy Simone Simon, this film is one of the few perfect horror films.  This VHS edition is in SP speed and gives a very clear picture and sound.  The black levels are good so night scenes (of which there are many) are  always nicely visible.

215707,5,630018286X,"Scary and unique, Cat People is one of my forever favorites from one of my favorite 'edge' directors, Paul Schrader (Blue Collar, Light Sleeper).  The first hour is excellent, beautifully photographed (the outstanding cat steals the show even from the goddess of sensuality Nastassja Kinski -- and that's saying something!) and skillfully directed to terrify.  The attack scenes are uniquely brutal and totally excellent.  In a heartbeat, I'd rather face a hungry Velociraptor than that cat!

Among all the eeriness and savagery, Schrader flashes a twisted sense of humor.  Humor?  In one attack scene, he borrows from the Three Stooges (the flipping tail scene).  In another horrifying attack, Schrader flashes a sight gag to make it comically obvious the poor guy is about to get shredded.

Cat People loses some of its momentum in the second hour and veers into triple-R rated strangeness, featuring Kinski's sensuality.  Do not let your kids anywhere near this film.  It's a good thing that Kinski and Malcolm McDowell never did have a child together because their baby would come out with three heads and a serpent's tail.  Always check  under your bed for black leopards before you go to sleep!",1504396800,2,1200,5.066326530612245
215708,4,630018286X,"This 1942 black and white film is a well-done horror tale for about 70 minutes based on ancient superstitions, about the fear of cats, especially black ones, and about the belief that evil can be transmitted from one person's body to another, especially by having a child, and about the power of the cross in protecting people from evil. In the film, a woman comes to the US from Serbia, a country many think is filled with monsters, invites a man to tea, forms a relationship with him and marries him. He soon hears that she is afraid that she can turn into a cat, specifically a panther. He thinks she is crazy because this is impossible. He sends her to a psychiatrist who doesn't believe her story and wants to kiss her. She warns him that if he does, she will turn into a panther. But he does not listen to her. She attacks her husband and his girlfriend after hearing from him that he no longer loves her and loves the other woman. Her husband saves himself and his girlfriend from the panther by raising a cross. The plot raises the question: what will happen to the Serbian woman?",1501718400,,1088,4.417910447761194

215738,5,630018286X,"I just caught the Criterion DVD of Cat People and wow! This one just keeps getting better with repeated viewings. The commercial success of Cat People upon its release delighted RKO and helped offset the box office failure of Orson Welless Citizen Kane. This is only just since, truth be told, Cat People may well be the better movie (but don't tell anyone I said so!). Certainly Cat People is arguably a more audience-friendly film than Kane. Its one of those moments of cinematic alchemy when all the elements come together to produce a near perfect whole, and is a classic example of the artistic dictum of doing more with less.

Anyhow the Val Lewton chillers produced for RKO in the early Forties  nine in total  are known for low-keyed terror and suggesting more than was actually shown on the screen. But in a kind of perverse irony its whats on the screen, i.e. the films incredibly atmospheric visual style, that makes them so compelling, and indeed places them in a unique historical niche: that of the first foreshadowing of the genre critics later dubbed film noir. In Cat People each scene is a masterpiece of visual composition in which the abstract and representational elements combine to form and sustain the dreamlike ambience which haunts the film.

Lewton was fortunate to have at his disposal then largely unknown but immensely talented directors, best of all Jacques Tourneur, who directed present film as well as The Leopard Man and I Walked with a Zombie. Are the Val Lewton RKO films, with their dark, sfumato look, truly exemplars of noir? If so, then Cat People may be the first true film noir.",1499558400,,1621,4.7785714285714285

215742,4,630018286X,"It was about sadness. Irena was miserable. Pitiably so. Caring, making friends, being in love doomed her. And was she, or wasn't she? You're left to draw your own conclusions

In contrast to Irena's misery, Oliver and Alice's relationship appeared selfish and self absorbed and Oliver simply dense. What. He never was unhappy? Pfft. His restraint toward Irena leaned more toward ""meh, she's my wife"" than ""I am so super caring that I shall endure and reject my painful desires.""

I liked that Alice was an intelligent woman, a skilled working girl. More clever than Oliver she convinced him he loved her because she loved him - dump Irena, I'm right for you. Oliver's character would settle for anything half decent. He wasn't even sure if he was in love with Irena. He's the type who cannot *love*. Which explains paragraph two.

Simone Simon was beautiful. Her acting career stalled in the USA due to misinformation given her early on. Act the diva, show them what you're worth. She was cast as leading ladies but fell ill (or was dismissed because of attitude depending on who tells it) and had to be replaced.

The very best aspect of the film were the minor characters, the cameos. The cleaning lady, the waitress, the desk girl. And of course the lighting.",1496534400,,1262,4.748858447488584

215744,3,630018286X,"There are pros and cons with this film. I love the look, mood and music score, but the story is confusing and not well written and does not follow it's own rules. This director even admits  in the commentary to the film being confusing and not following it's own rules. The reason I watched the commentary was because I was trying to make sense of this mess.  I've seen this film a few times including when it was originally released in the theater when I was a kid. Every time I watch this it leaves me with more questions than answers which really distracts from the film in my opinion. It could have been a much better film, but unfortunately it falls short and does not live up to it's potential. The plot holes prevent this beautiful film from being great.  I still enjoy parts of it, yet am irritated by the huge flaws. The Giorgio Moroder score and David Bowie song are excellent. On a side note, the score for the remake of ""Maniac"" is also excellent although it sounds like a rip off of the score from this film.",1495152000,,1021,4.335078534031414

215774,3,630018286X,"""American Gigolo"" writer & director Paul Schrader and ""Deranged: Confessions of a Necrophile"" scenarist Allen Ormsby remade director Jacques Tourneur's eerie, shape-shifting saga ""Cat People"" that DeWitt Bodeen wrote for RKO Pictures producer Val Lewton in 1942. By and large, these two films differ more often than they resemble each other. Tourneur's atmospheric, black and white, 73-minute original left much to the imagination since it was released while the Production Code Administration ruled Hollywood with an iron fist, and Schrader's 118-minute adaptation left little to the imagination. Comparably, the 1942 creature feature surpasses its remake. Nevertheless, Schrader and Ormsby have forged a horror film that is still stimulating to watch despite its many shortcomings. The two films show how much Hollywood changed between 1942 and 1982. Many things that the respective filmmakers dealt with changed in terms of the frankness of their depiction. Mind you, Simone Simon never disrobed in the original, whereas Nastassja Kinski had no qualms about cavorting about in the nude. Reportedly, the actress requested that her nude scenes be cut from the finished film, but the studio preserved them in tact in spite of her wishes. The two films deal with a virgin who leaves her native land and comes to America where she encounters situations that bring about changes in her demeanor. In the original, Irena is a refugee from a Middle-European country, and in the remake Irena hails from Africa. The chief difference between the two movies is the ending. Anybody who hasn't seen either film should stop reading this brief analysis at this point because the revelations may spoil your appreciation of the films. In the 1942 version, Irena is doomed to die because she is an evil creature, but the 1982 version displays greater optimism because Irena survives and lives out her life as a black leopard albeit confined to a zoo. Schrader's film changed the occupation of Oliver and Alice. Whereas they worked in a ship-building firm in the first film, Oliver and Alice work at the New Orleans Zoo in the second. Oliver and Irena were never allowed to consummate their marriage in the first film. Although Oliver and Irena never got married in Schrader's epic, they engaged in sex twice. Tom Conway's womanizing psychiatrist has no counterpart in Schrader's film. The two films do share similar scenes. For example, Schrader's film duplicates the scene with a woman who recognizes Irena and comments about their common origins. The scene in the swimming pool when Irena stalks Alice is staged with less atmosphere than the original. Oliver alone confronts Paul instead of Irena while wielding a drafting ruler in a manner similar to how Kent Smith did in the original.

Schrader's remake situates the story in New Orleans, and Irena arrives to be reunited with her long, lost brother Paul Gallier (Malcolm McDowell of ""A Clockwork Orange"") who has spent his life searching for her. Paul fails to consummate the incestuous relationship that he yearns for with the virginal Irena. We learn from expository dialogue sequences that their parents engaged in incest and ran their own circus. Nevertheless, Schrader and Ormsby leave out a lot regarding the origins of these characters. In the opening, we see tribesman tie a young woman to a tree as a sacrificial lamb for a black leopard to do with as the beast sees fit. Remarkably, the leopard doesn't shred the girl, but it seems to embrace her. Later, she is taken to the cave where the beast lives and enters it, but we see nothing that occurs thereafter between the two. Paul Gallier has led a secretive life and he has a mysterious African-American, Female (Ruby Dee of ""Do The Right Thing"") who serves as his housekeeper. When she meets Irena, Female explains her own orphaned origins and the nature of her name. All Paul wants is to have sex with Irena, but our heroine doesn't share either his inclination or his alacrity. She rebels and strikes out into the Crescent City. Meantime, Paul behaves like a serial killer of sorts who arranges clandestine rendezvous with women and kills them. He fails when he tries to eat a hooker and winds up trapped in a hotel room after the hooker, Ruthie (Lynn Lowry of ""The Crazies""), manages to escape from the premises. She tumbles down the stairs in the hotel and has a wardrobe malfunction. Paul transforms into a cat and leaves behind a placenta of sorts. Nobody can figure out how a black leopard came to be in the hotel room with the hooker. The authorities summon Oliver Yates from the New Orleans Zoo to capture the animal and remove it. Eventually, Irena discovers Paul's presence in the zoo and she has an encounter one evening after closing hours when Oliver confronts her. She was sketching a picture of the black leopard behind bars that she believes is her brother. Oliver and Irena met under similar circumstances in the original. They fall in love, but things become complicated.

Although Schrader's film isn't a classic like its Lewton produced predecessor, the ""Cat People"" remake is still a fascinating film. Actress Nastassja Kinski gives a memorable performance, and Malcolm McDowell is appropriately villainous as her brother.",1487894400,2,5245,5.027586206896552

215937,5,630018286X,"Cat People begins like a traditional romance with a couple that meets cute at a local zoo. Having trouble sketching the likeness of a black panther, Irena keeps on throwing away her unsatisfactory attempts but each time misses the trash can. Another zoogoer, Oliver Reed. disposes of her trash and jokingly chastises her. But after they strike up a conversation, this Oliver fellow seems less concerned that one of Irenas sketches, a badass image of a panther skewered on a sword, has slipped from her sketchbook and is left to muss up the city zoo. (This is before the EPA existed, so I guess people were a little looser about these things). Because we know this is a horror film, we also know that this relationship may not end well, and Cat People could be categorized as a horror-romance in the tradition of early gothic novels, The Mysteries of Udolpho, Wuthering Heights, and Jane Eyre, or later horror films like The Fly or Let the Right One In.

Irena and Oliver strike up a romance and eventually get married. Its not clear how long they were dating before marriage, but in the film it goes by quickly. It doesnt seem as if Oliver knows much about his bride before marriage, except that shes has a deep connection to her Serbian roots. In her apartment theres a statue of King John regally atop a horse with his sword held straight up impaling a large cat-like creature. This isn't Magna Carta King John, as Oliver first guesses; its actually Jovan Nenad, a sixteenth-century Serbian military commander who established the last independent Serbian state prior to the takeover by the Ottoman Empire. According to Irena, her village was captured by the Mamluk people, and soon after, the villagers started practicing witchcraft, which gave them the ability to turn into cat creatures. King John retook the village and killed those cat people who didn't flee into the neighboring wilderness.

Although my knowledge of Eastern European history is hardly encyclopedic, you can probably guess from the description Irena gives us that the King John was a Christian who drove out the Muslim Mamluks. (In fact, the Mamluks were a slave warrior caste that likely inspired George RR Martins The Unsullied). Like plenty of horror stories, Cat People is about fear of contamination. Irena symbolizes the immigrant to the United States who may not be as white and Christian as you think. The mismatch between Irena and her husband is further highlighted by Oliver Reeds absurdly Anglo sounding name.

Over time, Irena comes to fear that she herself is contaminated and may be one of the cat people. Another Serbian woman who bares a striking resemblance to a cat approaches Irena during her engagement dinner and speaks to her in her native tongue, calling her sister. According to legend, if a cat person kisses someone, she will transform into a cat and eat her mate. Cat People was made after the implementation of the Motion Picture Production Code, which established strict censorship over Hollywood cinema, so the film cant say this in so many words, but for the audience its pretty clear what kissing means in this context. In fact, Oliver even says something along the lines of, You know, its kind of weird were married and all and we haven't kissed yet.

Here it becomes clear the film also embodies the fear of female sexuality as well as racial difference. Even after he marries Irena, Oliver keeps up a flirtatious friendship with his coworker, Alice Moore, who expresses doubt early on about the viability of Olivers marriage. Like early film star and sex symbol, Rudolph Valentino, Irenas appeal comes from her darker complexion, which marks her as distinct from her blonde rival Alice. (Although he was Italian, Valentino also played Muslims, such as the title character in The Son of the Sheik). When Oliver, Irena, and Alice go on a museum trip, Alice should feel like the third wheel, but in fact Oliver suggests Irena explore other parts of the building because unlike him and Alice, she must be bored with these English ship models they're looking at. The implication, of course, is that Irena is racially, religiously, and culturally unsuited for Oliver.

Irena starts to become concerned that Oliver and Alice are having an affair, and at first it appears that the film is setting up Irena to be a paranoiac. When Olivers having a late night at the office, she tracks down her husband only to find him having a meal with Alice. She later stalks Alice late at night down starkly lit streets. This scene in particular is masterfully crafted, juxtaposing the sound of Irena and Alices increasingly frantic footsteps and ratcheting up tension until it is broken by the sound of a bus arriving at its stop. Anyone who has watched a horror film is familiar with the scene where we expect the killer to jump out of the shadows, but instead a friendly character or a cat jumps out instead. The technique apparently dates back to Cat People and is known as the Lewton Bus after producer Val Lewton. Theres also a scene where Alice jumps into a pool in order to escape from a large cat shes convinced is stalking her, and Im pretty certain this moment in the film inspired a similar scene in the indie horror film It Follows.

But Irena isn't as crazy as shes initially made out to be. In fact, Oliver is planning to leave his wife for Alice, and even gets the advice to annul the marriage, which is another indicator that the marriage was never consummated. In all honesty, Oliver is kind of a dick. I mean, dude, you married this woman who you barely knew and then won't step up when shes clearly having a difficult time. Whats more, you're ready to jump ship now that times are tough.

Thats not to say that Oliver doesnt try to help out his wife, but he does so in arguably the wrong ways. Hes convinced that Irenas cat person fears are only in her head, so he sends her to a psychiatrist. [Be warned. There are spoilers ahead]. When watching the film, I felt like there was something off about this psychiatrist dude. It turns out, like Irenas cat people phobia, this wasn't just in my head. The guys kind of a creep, and at the end of the film, he tries to kiss Irena, which I don't think would be looked kindly on by the APA. Until this moment, were not quite certain whether Irenas cat people fears are legitimate or not, but sure enough, she transforms into a leopard and mauls her therapist.

Its easy to see why Cat People has become a horror film classic. First off, director Jacques Tourneur drapes the film in shadows, a technique he would use in the film noir classic, Out of the Past. (If you ever wanted to watch Robert Mitchum walk into a room and knock out some schlub with just one punch, then you really should watch Out of the Past). Oliver works for an architecture agency, so Tourneur makes great use of underlit drafting tables to create incredibly stark, nearly abstract chiaroscuro. Second, the film is thematically rich. From issues of hybridity, race, religion, immigration, science and medievalism, Cat People contains a whole host of themes in its brisk seventy-three minute running time.

Ultimately, its difficult to reduce Cat People down to a single message. While it certainly embodies Americas fear of the other as present in our anxiety over immigration, it also seems more sympathetic towards Irena than not. After all, the men in the film, her husband and therapist, ultimately fail her. Shes a monster, but shes also the character whos easiest to identify with. Its not surprising that producer Val Lewton and director Jacques Tourneur, both of whom are immigrants, would take the point of view of Irena, and its unfortunately not surprising that the films exploration of Americas fear of immigrants who come from the Muslim world remains timely nearly seventy-five years later.",1477094400,2,7826,4.765486725663717

Like many others I'm hoping Criterion will release most of the famous ""poverty row"" productions that Lewton is famous for especially I Walked with a Zombie, The Seventh Victim and especially the underrated The Leopard Man. Those are my favorites but of course we will probably get Curse of the Cat People next. It's not really a horror film to me but a good film nonetheless. The Body Snatcher would be good also. One reviewer mentioned Hitchcock. I think the best of these cheap Lewton productions are, no matter how many times you see them, more moody and atmospheric than anything Hitchcock ever did. I suppose that's virtually a blasphemous statement but notice I didn't say better but the Lewton films evoked a dreamlike feeling better than anything I've experienced watching films over the past half century. Several years ago I purchased from Amazon the Lewton boxed set which I love. One Dvd has some excellent special features included. Hopefully, Criterion will be able to license the entire package and release them as a set or individually. It would be an automatic upgrade in a heartbeat for me with the possible exception that Criterion does one of it's rare mediocre upgrades. I've never been interested in detailed plot descriptions but the overall finished product. I give 5 stars for Criterion and yes, since I haven't seen it yet I'm going out on a limb but also 4 1/2 to 5 for the movie itself. Fans of modern horror will not like this in most cases. This movie is quiet, spooky, unpredictable and actually something of a tragic love story",1472774400,2,1615,4.81294964028777
216023,5,630018286X,"CAT PEOPLE (1942) was the first of a series of acclaimed, atmospheric low budget horror films that producer Val Lewton made for RKO Pictures during the 1940s.

It stars Simone Simon as a Serbian immigrant in New York who believes that, because of an ancient curse, any physical intimacy with the man she loves, will turn her into a feline predator.  Certainly this does not bode well for her new husband (Kent Smith), who ultimately loses his patience and seeks comfort from a co-worker (Jane Randolph).

In other words, the poor guy wants to get laid.

His action, of course, results in his wifes beliefs converting into a deadly reality.

Directed by Jacques Tourneur, CAT PEOPLE is an excellent example of how one can create an effective horror movie without the use of CGI or other special effects.  Indeed, all of the terrifying moments in this classic of the genre are brought about with the superb use of shadowy images and sound effects.  We never see the monster, because there was not enough money in the budget to create it.

Tom Conway, Jack Holt and Alan Napier co-star in the picture, released in a new Blu-ray edition  by The Criterion Collection.

This disc has a 2K digital restoration, with uncompressed monaural soundtrack, plus some terrific extras.  They include an excellent 2008 feature-length documentary on Val Lewton, audio commentary from 2005 by film historian Gregory Mank, with excerpts from an audio interview with Ms. Simon, a 1979 interview with director Jacques Tourneur, and a new interview with cinematographer John Bailey about the look of the film.  There is also a booklet that contains an essay by film critic Geoffrey OBrien.

For me ""Cat People"" the 1942 original is a real classic and was a daring film for its time. Moreover if you consider the powers and tenets of Hays Code (which covered all US film making at the time); which were meant to preserve public morality, from overzealous film makers. The film can truly be called daring and original.

This 1942 movie gets under your skin. ""Cat People"" is fabricated almost entirely out of fear. There wasn't a budget for much of anything else. With a narrative that has running time of just over one hour ten minutes. This is a film with little, if nothing, in the way of special effects. There are no major stars; the violence is indirect or to be implied - but not much seen. Yet the film, made as a B picture for only $135,000, became top earner for 1942, bringing in $4 million and staved off the studios debts.

Boy meets girl, where Irena is sketching a panther at the zoo when she meets the clean-cut architect Oliver Reed He walks her home, she asks him in for tea, and they fall in love. She talks of her village in Serbia, of the credence to a tale that shielded satanic cultists could take the form of cats. The good King tried to eradicate these cat people, but some fled into the mountains, where they are said to live to this day. Irena secretly fears she is one of those people. There is something subtly alarming about the oddly genteel good-girl behaviour. Irena is a beautiful woman who never sleeps with her new husband, not even a kiss, because she fears that her desire could turn her into a panther. There is the unearthly detachment of Kent Smith as her husband. It come as no surprise that Smith begins to work late at the office, where his co-worker Alice is all too sympathetico to his situation. For the rest you had better see the movie.

The sets that depict the rooms and streets do not look like places but like ideas of places. There is clear mastery of the use of light and shadow. Irena often placed in darkness, with the casted silhouettes of other characters on the wall behind her, they enclose her with shadows that work like a cage.

For me there something touching about Irena, who has never had a friend and she fears, she will kill the only person she loves, and is told she is insane. At the end, Oliver pays her a simple tribute: ""She never lied to us.

216192,5,630018286X,"The Cat People evolved way back in prehistory. As certain tribal groups sacrificed/offered up young women to leopards who seemed to have been deified, who then coupled with them. These Cat People look similar to humans (or can they be described as unwilling shape shifters?), however, they must mate with other Cat People before they transform into panthers. If they do not mate with their own kind, the results are bloody and terrible.

The initial narrative is Irene Gallier who was raised by adoptive parents and meets her older brother Paul for the first time since childhood. We follow brother and sister - who seem to be the only ones of their kind. It soon comes to the fore that for Paul to attain any physical relationship with a woman, he must contemplate an unpalatable truth.

The underlying principle in both the 1942 Cat People and the 1982 remake are the same: A striking Anglo-Saxon beauty is given to metamorphosing into a black panther when she is sexually aroused. The caveat here being that the remake also deals with a mans sexuality and his possible social transgressions from what is acceptable, and what is not in todays society, such as incest and violence.

For me the 1942 original is a real classic and was a daring film for its time. Moreover if you consider the powers and tenets of Hays Code; which were meant to preserve public morality, from overzealous film makers. The film can truly be called daring and original. The 1982 remake, in certain circles is much lampooned. Many site thematic inconsistencies in the plot, the non-cohesiveness of the narrative. A film that is more skin, then horror and then there is the growing misogyny that seems to go unfettered. I do not want to even try defending against these accusations. However, for me the combination of a good OST and David Bowies classic song made this film haunting and certain aspects a very cerebral experience, and hence my five star rating.",1447113600,,1939,4.799401197604791

216227,3,630018286X,"The mythology of this seems quite strange, and it seems as if clearing this up right at the start (which this film teases, but does not) might very well be the correct way to do it. After eating too many humans, some panthers have acquired human form and start living among humans. If they have sex with a human they revert to panther form, and when they kill (or maybe eat?) a human they can go back to human form. Not too illogical. Therefore they can only have sex with their own kind* (since a woman calls Irena 'sister' we are to assume that there are others out there, thus contradicting the later point that Irena is now the last one - with no choice for a mate once Paul is dead.)

Irena, one of these cat people, visiting New Orleans starts on a quest to find out the truth about her origins. Unfortunately for her she falls in love with a regular human, chooses not to kill and is doomed to live in a zoo in cat form (spoiler alert.)

There are some incogruities: Irena's brother Paul (McDowell) lives a serial killer life with a housekeeper (?) named Female (for some reason much is made of this fact, with no bearing on anything.) His dungeon is sorta found out in some unexplained manner (a dog barks, and all of a sudden we are shown it.) A whole movie could be made of this element, but here it is just kinda thrown out there. Most of the time Paul is in cat form (once before he has sex) or is on the lam.
In the meantime Irena gets a job at the zoo (and a sad excuse for a zoo it is with miniature cages and apes next to the cats.) She falls in love with a keeper (Heard,) finds out the truth from her brother in person (and in dreams, once Paul is killed.) Realizes she is doomed and leaves town with the last of her money (a scene later she is back in town with no explanation.) She stalks the other female interested in the zoo keeper (in cat form? - just what the hell is going on in this scene?), has sex with him, turns into a cat, kills, asks him to have sex again - to which he agrees!!! She turns into a cat again and is thrown in the pokey for the rest of her existence.

If Heard is not one of the most despicable characters in Horror film history I'll eat my hat.

Based on his performance on If.... (1968), one scene in particular, I can see why someone would think that Malcolm McDowell is perfectly cast for this movie. But even if he is fine in the part he seems weirdly out of place. Kinsky also seems well suited for the role of a foreigner or cat woman. John Heard has always seemed a slimy guy to me, and this may be the very movie where the feeling originated. Heard (decades before he was fighting Sharknados) is in what clearly is a thankless role.  Also with Ed Begley and John Larroquette.  Director Schrader seems to be going for a Joe Dante approach (cat cartoons, music, commercials, etc. are constantly in the fore and background, whether they have anything to do with the tone or not,) hammering the cat theme which is in direct contradiction of the subtlety of Torneur. Why bother even attempting to repeat whole sequences from the 1942 film?

All in all this movie seems like many potentially good things that might work, but ultimately do not quite jell into a whole.
This film might be enjoyed if seeked out as one of the more perverse & unusual fantastic films out there, but in terms of normal, straightforward horror it is an utter failure.

There are new interviews of the casts, but unfortunately 30 years later they no longer maintain their sexual tensions, and the price could be a little lower, but overall it is a great addition to my library.

The Cat People originated way back in time, when humans sacrificed their women to leopards, who mated with them. Cat People look similar to humans, but must mate with other Cat People before they transform into panthers, Irena Gallier was raised by adoptive parents and meets her older brother Paul for the first time since childhood. We follow brother and sister who seem to be the only ones of their kind left. Irena does not want to be like her brother and falls in love with another man, then the animal starts to show,

216386,5,630018286X,"This is Nastassja Kinski at the top of her game!

I first became a fan of Nastassja Kinski after watching ""Tess of the D'Urbervilles"".  Not only was she a very convincing, natural actress, but she was beautiful.  It really is too bad that her career took a downturn in the mid 1980s.  An actress of her talents should have won an Oscar or two by now.

This is a supernatural horror movie, make no mistake.  Blood and gore are aplenty.  However, it is also a movie about sexual awakening.  Before you jump to conclusions, this is not one of those typical 1980s sexual awakening kind of movie.  It is nothing like ""Sixteen Candles"" or ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"".  This is also not a bloody slasher like the Friday the 13th franchise.  The closest similarity that I can think of is ""The Howling"".  This, in my opinion, is in the same category, as that movie.

The movie takes place in New Orleans.  Irena Gallier has reached young womanhood and has come to the city to live with her brother, Paul.  Their parents died when both were young.  Irena grew up in an orphanage.  It has been many years since she has seen her brother, who has made a comfortable life for himself in New Orleans.

Unusual for a woman of about 18 years of age, Irena is a virgin.  Unaware of her family's secret, she falls in love with a zoo curator.  Her brother explains to her that they are a race of humans who transforms into panthers whenever they have sex with a regular human.  The only way to revert back into human form is to kill.  Paul also tells her that their parents were brother and sister.  The only way to avoid shape-shifting into a panther while having sex is to make sure the partner is also a ""cat people"".  He tells her that she will end up killing her future lover.  Irena refuses to accept this and resist Paul's sexual advances.  As her sexuality awakens, her primal nature starts to slowly come out.

I do not want to spoil the rest of this excellent movie for you.  Let me just say that the acting performances are superb.  Do yourself a favor and add this cult classic to your collection.",1417824000,,2092,4.403141361256544

216388,3,630018286X,"This is kind of a double review, since I figured that Id watch both the 1942 original and the 1982 remake back to back.  Both films serve as interesting examples of the way that film has evolved, and the way that the eras in which these films were released were shaped.  The 40s, consumed with the effective atmosphere of the film noir, were all about lurking in the shadows, creating a feeling of intensity relying more on the power of suggestion than anything else.  The 80s were a different story altogether.  The early 80s in particular seemed really intent on creating a sweaty, soap operatic tone everywhere, basting each film with this pulpy sexuality, and it shows in how much they were willing to show to make this remake salacious.

What I find so fascinating is that, despite their vastly different approach, both films were equally dull.

Yup, I said dull.

The faux sense of dread attempted in Jacques Tourneurs 1942 cult classic is shockingly ineffective.  I was really dumbfounded as to how little these moments worked, especially when you consider the effectiveness of so many beautifully woven noirs of the same time period.  The fact that this was, for all intents and purposes, a horror film also makes its overall feel and effect disappointing.  I wanted to feel shivers, chills even, but instead the only chill I got was from the overhead fan accidentally being kicked on high.  The moments (like the pool scene and the scene with the Dr.) all felt so staged and underdeveloped.  The atmosphere was lost on a plot that just didn't really come together.

I think that is an issue that both version share.  The plot just feels so unremarkable.  It is most obviously nonsensical and just plain stupid, but instead of taking that and running with it into the depths of absurdity, its almost not absurd enough to even be interesting.  Paul Schraders 1982 remake tries to take it a few (a lot) steps further, but it pushes it into tacky, campy ridiculousness instead of making it feel exciting and grounded in anything more than carnal stupidity.

The 1982 version was like too many fetishes thrown into one romp.

As camp classics, which lets face it, they both are, I can see some value in the remake (since its campy and theres some really bold themes like incest and bestiality floating around there) but the original is just a real bore from start to finish, which I didn't expect.  Simone Simon is so stale, as is Kent Smith.  At least Nastassja Kinski and John Heard were engaging actors (and Malcolm McDowell is all sorts of sexually intense), even if the chemistry was hard to swallow (but a lot of that has to do with the ridiculous idea that these men are drawn to such a dull creature).

The 1982 remake utilizes the visual effects that made werewolves all the craze the year prior, while the 1942 original fails to make shadows an object of fear.  The remake isn't scary either, but at least it looks cool (sometimes).",1414368000,,2946,4.690661478599222

in my opinion, shout factory have done it again with 1982 Thriller/Horror Cat people
which is a remake of the old 1940'S film Cat people
in 1981-1982 universal were doing remakes of some of their old films from the 1940'S and 1950'S
one of them was THE THING by John carpenter and the other was CAT PEOPLE by Paul Schrader

Shout factory got the rights from Universal to release Cat people on blu-ray
the new widescreen picture Looks Great in High Definition very clear and beautiful
the audio is average thou, the audio could've been boosted up bigtime i think.
but that's just my opinion. but the look of the film looks stunning.

there is also all new special features aswell that was not on the dvd release
all new interviews with Nastassia Kinski, Annette O'toole, Malcolm Mc Dowall
Lynn Lowry, Paul schrader and Giorgio Moroder
some of the interviews only go for about 5mins and some go for 10-15mins
unfortunately you can't play them altogether which is very annoying
they have to be watched seperatly
but if you could play them all, it would be about 1 hour of new interviews about the making of Cat people
all very interesting interviews aswell
Theatrical trailer and Photo/stills Gallery are included

so probably best to throw out the old dvd release and get this all new blu-ray release
it's Definitely time for an upgrade i gave it 5 stars for sure.",1390953600,2,1487,4.711538461538462
216538,4,630018286X,"As a big fan of Nastassja Kinski, I am well satisfied with the new Blu-Ray release of Cat People. The Blu-Ray is richer in color than the HD DVD version and the night scenes look sharper. As far as the movie is concerned, Nastassja Kinski carries this film throughout. She is aided by good performances by Malcolm McDowell, John Heard, and Annette O'Toole. One of the films major strengths is the soundtrack by Giorgio Moroder.  My only disappointment is the cast interviews. Would have liked more discussions  of the film. On the HD DVD release, there is a Commentary throughout by Director Paul Schrader which provides a lot of insight on the making of the film.  It should have been included.  Despite some criticism of the film transfer, I thought the film looks great on my set, and it's a worthwhile addition to my film library.",1390521600,10,834,4.691780821917808
216539,3,630018286X,"Paul Schrader's ""Cat People"" is an unusual remake of Val Lewton and Jacques Tourneur's classic 1940's film. It's unique and an equal in its own way to the moody original film. It's a pity that ""Cat People"" didn't get a bit more TLC in this Blu-ray transfer because, while the film source is quite good, this is an older HD transfer.

My complaint isn't with the film itself which is enjoyable and well made with strong performances from Nastassja Kinski, Malcolm McDowell and John Heard (plus a terrific title song performed by David Bowie) but with this substandard Blu-ray transfer.

Shout Factory has been doing some fine work for most of their releases (""The Howling"" was a tad overprocessed as well but acceptable) but this is an exception. The studios provide Shout (or Scream in this case)with the transfer and usually that's not a problem as a lot of them have been exceptionally good. When they get one that is substandard, however, the studio needs to push back--the images in ""Cat People"" are overprocess eliminating a lot of detail and textures creating plasticine people and smooth textures both an indication of an older less well done high definition transfer.

I suspect that this is the same original HD master used for the HD-DVD released ages ago with a new encoding with some tweaking.

Having said all of the above about this transfer, it isn't a horrible transfer just substandard. I suspect that Shout elected to release this substandard transfer without blinking an eye. Someone needs to tell Shout that grain and detail are good things. Their quality control is slipping.

There are some positives to the image--the colors are bold and the interpositive used for the transfer lacks any print damage and looks in very good shape so there are some positives.

We get the original stereo mix as well as a nice 5.1 mix. Subtitles are available in English.

Shout does a good job with the special features including a series of new interviews with Schrader, Kinski, Heard and McDowell. The interviews vary from 5 minutes to 9 in length. We also get an interview with composer Giorgio Moroder discussing working with Schrader and David Bowie. All of the interviews run around 50 minutes combined.

The special features are rounded out with photo and promotional galleries for the film as well as the original theatrical trailer. Finally we get a reversible cover art featuring the new art work commissioned for the film and one based on the theatrical one sheet on the opposite side (my preferred one--I don't care for the new art work myself).

I wouldn't give this version of the film 5 stars because of the substandard, older transfer of the film. The special features are quite good but Shout really needs to step up their game and demand up-to-date quality transfers for the films they release.",1390435200,8,2818,4.854166666666667

216542,4,630018286X,"The DVD itself is fantastic and is a collector's item. These older horror films are enjoyable, and this is the kind of story that I find worthwhile. Picture is very good, and the sound is fine, with a dark, menacing score by Moroder, and a color palette that is both sensual and troubling.
Schrader's version of this story, though, is intellectually aloof and not without passion. His camera seems to be more in love with Irena than with the plot details (not that this is a bad thing, as the original film's Simone Simon was also a knockout), and this leads to an overwhelming sense of voyeurism as opposed to a complete investigation of the film's characters. The film has been accused of being pornographic, but that's not a fair criticism, as we've seen much worse elsewhere. I don't really think this film was trying to be offensive in any way, despite the scenes of sexuality and nudity. So, in sum, not Schrader's best moment but, as with Universal's current DVD release of ""Dracula"" (1979), this is a keeper of a DVD. Whether or not you find it better than the Lewton version is insignificant because this film is both fun and disturbing in its own way, and not truly a contribution to the horror genre as it is academically defined.

Atmospheric, sensual, unnerving, and artistically shot and conceived, Cat People is a great thriller. And Nastassia Kinski pretty much steals every scene with her preternatural beauty. She's as feline as any actress ever, and affects a real sense of pathos and tragedy as Irina, a girl in the verge of her sexual awakening--one that she instinctively knows has dark consequences. Solid supporting performances from John Heard, Malcolm McDowell, and Annette O'Toole, although I found Ruby Dee's accent unconvincing.

216564,4,630018286X,"First things first. I have to confess to the fact that I have had a crush on Kinski since I saw her in either To The Devil a Daughter or Tess from the late 70's to the early 80's. Ok, my disclaimer has been addressed and confessed to and now to my review.
This was the first time that I've seen this movie and was somewhat surprised at how good it was. I was taken aback by how much younger McDowell, Heard and O'Toole all looked, but not by Nastassia's (21 at the time) who today still looks young for her age.
The location for this movie couldn't of been any better with New Orleans rich and flavorful history with its mixture of cultures, people, religions and beliefs. If there are cat people in the US thats where they'll be.  The residents that McDowell used as his lair came complete with a basement jail to keep him and or his victims from escaping and helped to address why he was never caught with any of his victims until? McDowell's care giver Dee played another key role in helping to sell this story as she covered up and fixed the feeding/mating messes that McDowell's character made while dinning in.
Heard plays the curator for the N O Zoo and is called out to capture a black Panther at a local house of ?? and with the help of O'Toole's character they bring the cat in alive. Heard and O'Toole both play their parts very well and they're characters are in some type of a relationship that will come into play during the movie. Begley jr. plays an assistant along with O'Toole at the zoo for Heard and together the they work to care and maintain the animals including the big cats.
The architectural beauty of the zoo with its patina rooftops, red brick, ornate iron work and the sculpted big cats perched atop the viewing areas are breathtaking and add so much flavor to this story.
The writing, acting, direction all compliment one another and combined tell a sad story of a twisted and tormented family that belong to a small group of cat human species that are struggling to survive. The twisted relationship that McDowell and Kinski have is bizarre. The two were separated at an early age and adopted out she lived in Europe and he in the US and after a long search McDowell's character finds his sister and brings her to N O. His mannerisms towards her have more of a sexual nature to them instead of a brothers love when they meet and continued until she put a stop to his advances. I'm not going to say any more about whats going on so I won't spoil it for you. The movie is well worth the time for its story, acting, directing and the locations.
My only issue and its a small one is why doesn't Heards character investigate just what this newly found species is and try do what should have come natural for a zoologist? That for me was what was missing from an otherwise great story and again its just a minor issue.
PLEASE NOTE; if you are a Ray Wise fan look for his maybe 10 second appearance in one unusual scene. Here's a hint listen for his voice. I'm sure when you see this weird scene you'll zero in on his voice. Good Luck!

This remake of the 1940's classic, is the cat's meow, literally, especially with beautiful Nastassja Kinski in the starring role! She has one problem though, when she gets sexually aroused, she becomes...well...lets just say, a tad feral.

Malcolm McDowell, as Nastassja's brother, always had a penchant for bizarre films & roles, this is no different, as he wants to mate & be mated to his sister for life. This is because their both of the same affliction, sexual arousal causes them to change, to kill, to become a cat! A BIG cat! The only way for them to have sex, & have their partner survive it, is to be an incestuous pair. Though this will repulse people, it makes sense in the film, for our morals don't apply here, & this makes for a unique film of surrealism, as Nastassja spurns her brother for another. The idea of incest repulses her too, but maybe for different reasons than normal. A portrait, a metaphor, of a young beautiful woman coming to grips with her growing sexuality.

""The Cat People"" is not for everyone, but those of you that are, will know it, as soon as the cat scratches you!

Curators John Heard and Annette O'Toole have the job of capturing a black panther trapped in a hotel room after the cat molests a prostitute. So, how did the panther get into the hotel room?

The Scream Factory is a division of The SHOUT Factory. Who I believe use to be Rhino Records. So, I am glad to see that a company like Rhino Records is getting into the Blu-Ray market.  And since The SHOUT Factory is showing so much attention towards movies from the eighties, and since Rhino use to be all about music, I wish that they would get into making Blu-Ray releases of 80's MTV videos. It would be fun to collect those.  Anyway, back to ""Cat People.""

I also noticed that This SCREAM Factory release of Cat People states that the film is PG-13. My DVD of this film says that it is Rated R, and it should be Rated R.  I hope that they are not going to release some sort of edited version of this film because that would truly be an atrocity. Anyway....

This is a Gothic cult classic from the eighties.  For years, the DVD of this fine film has been available as a muddy, grainy, silhouette-shadowy, version that is really no better than the VHS tape version.

But, this movie has a lot to offer for its cinematography and its music.  To see this film in high definition would make it one of my favorite films from the eighties.

It's got a fabulous backdrop scenery of many ancient and historic parts of New Orleans.

The leopard tree dream sequences are beautifully created and should be seen and heard in high definition for its color and beauty.

Giorgio Moroder's soundtrack score is some of the best terrifying background music ever put to a movie.

And, to me personally, to see Nastassia Kinski's beautiful eyes and lips and many of her nude scenes, in the best possible picture quality that can be remastered, would be a great source of eye candy to back up this film's story.  Her cat eyes are so mysterious and alluring.  She was so perfect for the role.

In the original, the erotic aspects are hinted at, while the 1982 version lays it on a bit too thick.  The main actress, Ms. Kinski does a fine job in this film, and we will probably never see John Heard look as fit and thin as he is here, but the rest of the acting is pretty atrocious.

Seems she knows she came from a line of ""Cat People"" and passion can bring out her claws. This is reinforced in a scene at a restaurant where another one of her kind (Elizabeth Russell) who recognizes Irena for what she is. Irena also suspects her new hubbie's female assistant Alice Moore (Jane Randolph) has designs on him. So we get a spooky scene at a swimming pool at night when Alice is alone in the gym.

There was not enough money or sufficient technology to show scary cat people. They tried people in cat suits, but they just looked cutesy. So they decided to just show shadows and sounds. The rest was up to your imagination. It is a psychological movie with a touch of film noir.

Jacques Tourneur directed for producer Val Lewton this classic work of terror in which an average American man (Kent Smith) marries an exotic Serbian beauty (Simone Simon) who believes that an ancient curse makes her transform into a bloodthirsty leopard whenever a man tries making love to her.

Oliver Reed sends troubled Irena to a shrink (Tom Conway). Meanwhile he confides in co-worker Alice Moore (Randolph). Irena's jealousy at their friendship leads to unexplainabe events, frightening encounters and eventual tragic results.

I first learned about this movie some years after it was released by reading an article in Cinefantastique magazine which praised the movie and its special effects. It had great atmosphere, a good cast, really great special effects and a musical score that worked at setting the mood.  It was a remake that did credit to the original.",1244592000,,407,4.814285714285714
216694,5,630018286X,"Very different remake from the original Val Lewton film of 1942 that stressed suggestion over graphic Horror. This remake is basically a re-imagining and with an infinitely higher libido. While not the Horror classic that the original was, this is still highly reccomended as one of the most intelligently handled of all of 80s Horror films.

The plot tells the story of a sexy young woman named Irena(Nastassja Kinski) who travels to the South to see her brother(Malcolm Mcdowell) and discover a secret about her family. It turns out that she is derived from a race of ""Cat people"", a group of shape-shifters who can only pro-create with there own kind, otherwise if they engage in sex with a human they change into a Black panther!
Problems ensue when Irena falls for a young Zookeeper(John Heard) and her brother makes advances on her....

The film is really a Thriller about sexual repression and it's consequences, a popular topic in the Classic Horror film. Kinski is perfect in the role, appearing both virginal and highly sexual. Her performance is first rate and is one of the sexiest in the Horror film. With her lithe body, green eyes and dark hair she makes quite an attractive image. This is made more evident by her many nude scenes in the movie,among the sexiest in film history. Kinski's nude stroll through the forest at night is both artistic and highly sexy to boot. And that infamous ""Bondage"" scene at the end of the film is one of the screen's classic sex scenes.

The rest of the cast are very adequate including under-used actor, John Heard as Kinski's love interest. Annette O Toole as the estranged girlfriend of Heard's character(who gets to do a topless swim echoing the 1942 ""pool"" scene from the original). And Mcdowell is both creepy and sympathetic in the role of Kinski's brother.

Schrader's direction is first rate and surreal with a nice emphasis on mood and atmosphere. This is highlighted by a great score by Giorrgio Moroder, whose theme is fittingly erotic and mysterious. The locations are wonderful and become there own character under the skilled eye of the director.

The film conforms to some typical 80s Horror film conventions with some effectively gory sequences supervised by make up artist, Tom Burman. These include several torn apart bodies. The image of Ed Begley Jr. getting his arm clawed off by a panther and the transformations of people into cats. This was a big thing in the early 80s, what with the success of films like ""An American Werewolf in London(1981)"" and ""The Howling(1980)"". Transformation effects got better and better, reaching a peak in two remakes with ""The Thing(1982)"" and ""The Fly(1986)"". This one's effects though are still first rate and disgusting. It certainly is shocking to see the perfectly formed Kinski transformed into a big ol' panther!

Certainly not a film for all tastes. This film should appeal to fans of erotically melded Horror and Thriller films and fans of the original curious to see it's remake. Of course, male film fans with a penchant for the female figure(um, isn't that most of us?) will want to own this to see the first rate nudity of Miss Kinski in her finest skin moment ever.(and possibly best performance of her career....possibly.)
(And more manly note about Kinski's figure: Get a load of this chick's backside. I mean alot of guys love to mention the ample backside of Ms. Kim Kardashian and her ilk, but man, get a load of Nastassja in this film! Whoa-man! Awesome! Now back to the review....)

The DVD features are plentiful including a mini-documentary on the film, behind the scenes footage, Theatrical Trailer and commentary by the director.

216695,4,630018286X,"Extremely bizarre, controversial and erotic, ""Cat People"" stars Natassia Kinski (daughter of European film legend Klaus Kinski) as Irena Gallier.  An orphan and a virgin, she arrives in New Orleans in search of her estranged brother Paul Gallier [Malcolm McDowell of ""Halloween"" (2007)].  Soon she learns many terrifying secrets.  Her parents were brother and sister who committed suicide.  Her ancestors sacrificed their children to black panthers.  If she makes loves, she will transform into a black panther that must kill in order to once again become human.  Her only hope of remaining human is to live a celibate life or have an incestuous relationship with her brother.  Neither one seems feasible to her, especially since she has fallen in love with Oliver Yates (John Heard of ""C.H.U.D.""), the curator at the New Orleans Zoological Park.

  Exterior shots for ""Cat People"" were filmed in and around beautiful, historical New Orleans.  Wonderful direction was provided by Paul Schrader who also directed ""Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist.""  Schrader gives great commentary on the making of this film.  He explained that he chose Natassia Kinski because she was believable as a virgin whereas all of the other candidates weren't.  New Orleans was chosen as a setting because of its mystical aura - anything supernatural could happen there.  It is interesting to learn that ""Cat People"" was co-scripted by Alan Ormsby who wrote the screenplays for such horror shockers as ""Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things,"" ""Deranged,"" and ""Deathdream.""  Furthermore, a very hip rock-n-roll theme song is provided by superstar David Bowie.

  A great cast, suspenseful action, creepy, gothic settings, and gory deaths make ""Cat People"" a must see for fans of all classic horror films.  It is a feast for the eyes and an emotional tour de force.  A young girl is torn between her instincts and her moral values.  Must she sacrifice her ability to physically love another human in order not to kill?  Or will she be forced to love from afar, imprisoned by physical bars and spiritual morals?  If you enjoy watching people turn into animals and monsters, then you must also see ""The Fly,"" ""An American Werewolf in London"" and ""The Beast Within.""",1239235200,,2241,5.110192837465565

216729,4,630018286X,"Despite having been young, semi-conscious (I was under five years old) and possessing few actual memories of the nineteen eighties, the decade has a certain personal eroticism for me. The powdery skin, shimmering camerawork, the outrageous kink and camp of the clothing, the archetypical section of dim-minded actresses performing with the joyful vacant-eyed faces of children: these all stir my heart. The film Cat People was a smarter film when compared to too much of the artistic output of the nineteen eighties but it also suffered from the strangeness of the times. First of all, Nastassja Kinski has a sublime beauty that would attract in any decade but was especially characteristic of ideal notions of sexiness for those years. Her eyebrow were that exquisite Madonna-esque thickness, her lips in a permanent state of partial openness with full-on pout, her hair cut to that boyish cute, and her shoulder pads speaking volumes about her feminine authority. Even her cat-like demeanor, connected to the premise of the film, was equivalent to popular depictions of women as sex kittens. In essence, her performances in the film can be interpreted as one of the finest expressions of the nineteen eighties soft-lit, softcore pornographic aesthetic.

Secondly, as a horror film, it managed to offer moments of decent creepiness in the vein of the times. Fear, of course, has been a universal and timeless emotion yet it can be provoked in a manner reflective of the era. The Germans of centuries ago used grim and blood-spattered folk tales to frighten, director Paul Schrader used shadow. Shadows were such a magnificent aspect of the nineteen eighties aesthetic because their perfect in lockstep with the soft-lit light (consider the Vogue video).  Schrader employed shadows in an eerie manner that kept the viewer guessing, achieving what few horror directors actual get from their audiences: fearful concern about what was in the dark. Consider two scenes: when Malcolm McDowell lunges from the shadows as the beast and when Nastassja Kinski has a passion moment in that darkened room. Schrader brilliance was to make the shadow both fearful and erotic: the dark has been traditional as fear-provoker and yet can be quite intimate as well. In mixing the two emotions successfully, Schrader made the film a unique creature for the horror genre.

Third, that soundtrack Giorgio Moroder and Bowie crafted must be one of the strangest in the history of film. Starting off on a campy note, the music over the reddish desert of the first scene ought to make a person either laugh or weep but it does get better. Listen to it; it goes with the images on screen like magic.",1231200000,3,2674,5.04524886877828

216732,5,630018286X,"This was quite an interesting gory horror flick with lots of graphic nudity & violence, especially with wildcats and people who become them, which in this case were German actress Nastassja Kinski(Irena) and British actor Malcolm McDowell(Paul)along with the fact that CAT PEOPLE had a lot of violence and nudity, especially since Natassja did quite a bit of skinteresting nude scenes starting off in her first mufftastic nude scene where Irena roams around buck-naked in the forrest for no apparent reason in the middle of the night eating animals showing off Nastassja's Womanhood which was similar to the scene in AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON when David(David Naughton)runs around stark-naked in the forest showing off his Manhood just before he kills and eats a deer and then when Irena finally loses her virginity getting animalistic in bed with her boyfriend Oliver(John Heard)in the middle of the movie just before she transforms into a panther for the very first time.

Therefore, Irena has Oliver make love to her again one last time in order to spare Irena from being killed so she can be set free once & for all with the rest of her feline ancestors.

What's kind of funny is this horror flick kind of reminded me of DRESSED TO KILL in a way, since DRESSED TO KILL was a violent errotic kind of movie too, since DRESSED TO KILL was a terror film with a lot of killing, sex, and graphic nudity, especially with full-frontal nudity like CAT PEOPLE has.

The one thing about this movie CAT PEOPLE that I don't understand is why would Paul try to get into Irena's pants if Irena was actually Paul's long lost sister and knew that he was Irena's long lost brother all along.

However this was my favorite flick with Nastassja Kinski and Nastassja definetly put the word ""Kinky"" in the middle of her last name Kinski in CAT PEOPLE too since Nastassja's nakedness in this flick themselves was enough to sell more than enough tickets at the box office back in the Spring of 1982 since Nastassja's sexy ta-tas and beautiful pubic hair brought out the animal in a lot of us including myself since Nastassja had more nude scenes than anybody else in this movie especially since Nastassja was the only co-star in CAT PEOPLE who had every bangable part of her body shown from head to toe shown in this flick as opposed to the rest of the co-stars in this flick which needless to say was another thing that made Nastassja Kinski the star attraction as well as the main attraction of CAT PEOPLE especially since Nastassja was the only co-star in this terror film to be shown in full-frontal nudity like a bitch-in-heat.

This movie also takes me back to memory lane to when I was still living in the Imperial Valley and to when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had in 1981-1982 when Ronald Reagan was president along with the fact that I was 9 years old in the 3rd grade at Rockwood Elementary School in Calexico, CA when this movie was released in theatres back in the Spring of 1982 when I was living in my hometown(El Centro, CA), but Nastasjja Kinski was definitely eyecandy in this movie, especially when they showed us Nastassja's sexy genitals and Nastassja never looked better than she ever did in CAT PEOPLE either along with the fact that CAT PEOPLE was a deliciously nasty movie as well as a violent one, especially because of Nastassja.",1218585600,4,3373,4.66218487394958

She also reminds us of that simpler time when a B cup was a gift from heaven and a joy to behold (or hold). I can't wait for that fashion to come around again.

Logic eludes us, for example at the end when Irena decides - well, I won't spoil it for you, but the words and the foreseeable result of her final decision just don't line up. Also, earlier on, she makes some eye-blink transition from sweet young thing (doesn't eat meat) to carnivorous vamp. I think that a 1950s trace of ""fallen woman"" morality somehow leaked into this flick. No matter. If the R-movie people in your house want something to watch that won't get in the way of good conversation, give it a shot.

216734,4,630018286X,"When this film came out in the 80's, many critics lashed out at this revisionist remaking of the Val Lewton/Jacques Tourneur horror classic--like too much sex, blood & gore. What Paul Schrader basically did in his screenplay to the DeWitt Boden story was add his own obsessions, psychologically and sexual, to this story. At the time, Schrader was obsessed with his lead actress, Natasia Kinski, to the point that they were having an affair during the filming. Kinski, by the way, has never been more appealing or sexual on film than she is here thanks to Schrader's direction.  Also Malcolm McDowell as her incestuous brother is also excellent as is the always under-rated John Heard as the zookeeper who falls for her (probably representing Schrader) and Annette O'Toole as Alice, Kinski's romantic rival.  Ed Begley Jr is seen unfortunately briefly in an early role as a fellow zookeeper and veteran Oscar nominee, Ruby Dee is on hand to provide mystery as McDowell's housekeeper.  The New Orleans locations lend an air of Gothic ness to the story and though the '43 version is the better of the two, this still remains a fascinating look into sexual obsession (a recurrent theme in lot of Schrader's films beginning with ""Taxi Driver"").  I've seen this version several times plus once in HD, and it still holds up very well. Do yourself a favor if you're a horror buff like myself and check this one out.

Is there a problem when Oliver sees Alice at the restaurant? What happened to that sheep? The film suggests fear and terror by lighting effects, and a torn robe. Is Irena becoming insane?

216759,5,630018286X,"Back when it was in the theater around 1982, and I was a mere 15 year old, I happened to find myself entering a very ""R"" rated film instead of the movie I bought a ticket for, and since, have been in love with Kinski.

Don't be put off on the films date of release, though.  ""The Exorcist"" was a 1973 release, yet the effects and theme are still very unsettling, and no one has replicated the intensity of that film since.  Neither have they with ""Cat People,"" and still all the animal morphing and gore seem super-realistic, even though there was no computer aided effects, as they didn't exist.

This film is a remake, but a very GOOD remake, of an old film that simply 'suggested' the reason for the animalistic transformations.  With Kinsky at the helm, and her non-issue with full frontal nudity, the viewer is able to see the dynamics of a woman struggling with her sexuality, the unresolved issues surrounding her brother and family, and her deflowering, only to find herself transformed into a black panther.

I was surprised the film had received an 'R' rating, to be honest.  At the time, I would have thought pseudo-fellatio, female genitalia, breasts, a little bit of S & M, and very graphic dismemberments would warrent an 'X,' but somehow the director, Paul Schrader, passed with an 'R.'  The film, itself, is truly about uninhibited sexual expression, likening it to that of an animal.  At times it may appear pornographic, but quickly, something horrific happens, so there isn't a margin for the viewer to find anything arousing, as it is clearly delineated within the boundries of cinema.  While it may vascillate into what appears like porn, the reason this film isn't a pornographic piece is that it has no intention of titillating the viewer.  Every explicit sex act on screen is followed immediately by dismantlement.

Siskel and Ebert both gave it a ""thumbs-up"" back then, and I figured if they found it fascinating, I'd feel the same.

Cat People is the story of a young woman raised in foster care, Irena (Natash Kinski, who's travelled to ominous New Orleans to meet her long lost brother (Malcom McDowell).  Poor Irena's joy soon turns to a nightmare as it becomes evident that there is more to her brother, and his motives, than meets the eye.  Irena's brother's impatience, after years of pent up desire and frustration, leads him to abrubptly demand of Irena that she not only confront her inner panther but embrace it.  Her brother warns Irena that if she does not live by the laws of thier ""kind"" she will kill - and kill the ones she loves - ""Let me spare you that horror. . . . "".  Among the laws she must live by is to mate as brother and sister the way her parents did.  Irena is not happy to find out her long held suspicions and worst fears about herself are true and she rejects both her true self and her brother. But, as her brother warned, Irena finds out the hard way that she she cannot disrespect the panther within.

This is a great fun movie. It's perfect for a cold, rainy, fall Friday evening and a six pack after a long work week. It's a good date movie too.  It's not laced with gratuitous, pointless sex.

216761,5,630018286X,"Cat People (Jacques Tourneur, 1942)

Cat People is not only the best horror film that sprang from the collaboration between Jacques Tourneur and Val Lewton, it's one of the best horror films ever made. Tourneur and writer DeWitt Bodeen (it's impossible to believe this was his first filmed script) took an out-of-the-way Eastern European legend, crossed it with the werewolf-mania that gripped the monster-movie crowd in the thirties and forties, added a stock love story, and whipped it all into a wonderfully frothy chiller that still holds up after sixty-five years in the can (and a bland, if titillating, Paul Schrader remake in 1982).

Irina (La Bete Humaine's Simone Simon) is a lovely Romanian girl who falls in love with, and marries, the dashing Oliver Reed (The Night Stalker's Kent Smith). However, despite the fact that they're married, Irina refuses to let her husband even kiss her; she is convinced that, if she gives in to the throes of passion, she will become a panther and tear her husband to pieces, which (as she would have it) was quite common back in the old country. Oliver, understandably, thinks her elevator's not going quite to the top floor, and he and his work associate Alice (In Fast Company's Jane Randolph) try to get Irina the help they think she needs. Oliver and Alice, though, have all sorts of sexual tension running between them, and to make matters worse, the therapist Irina ends up going to, Dr. Judd (Tom Conway, who also worked on the Lewton-Tourneur collaboration I Walked with a Zombie), quickly develops a thing for her. Meanwhile, Irina finds herself drawn to the Central Park Zoo and the majestic panther in its cage.

I'll leave it to others to examine the movie's underlying themes of fear of the other and it's presaging of the McCarthy era (all of which has been well-covered) and just talk about how a fine producer and director can make even Z-grade special effects into something really special (a lesson that all too many indie horror directors these days could stand to learn). Tourneur, constrained by Lewton's legendary budget crises, had to do the best he could to try and preserve the ambiguity that makes the script so strong, and he does show by repeatedly refusing to show the monster. We just get hints, and that's really all we need to make this work-- a shadow that may or may not be feline, rustling bushes. It's all atmosphere, and that's what makes it work. Even in the scenes the studio insisted on putting in to make it a ""proper"" horror film, Lewton and Tourneur conspired to make things as ambiguous as possible with lighting tricks and jump-cuts. As Lewton's vision was to never reveal whether the whole cat curse is real or just a figment of Irina's imagination, atmosphere was really all he had to work with, and he does it exceptionally well. (Imagine what this movie would have been like with a bigger budget and slightly more advanced special effects-- which is what Paul Schrader could have made, but didn't.) You don't need a million-dollar special effects budget to cast an ambiguous shadow and rattle some bushes, but Cat People is a lot creepier than many of the horror films that have come since. **** ",1193875200,,3191,4.796363636363636

216763,5,630018286X,"Producer Val Lewton was forced to work with a small budget during his time with RKO, but faced with financial contraints and lack of star power, he hooked up with director Jacques Tourneur to create several horror films that many decades later are still considered the finest ever made in the genre. ""Cat People"" is one of those films.

In this masterpiece of the genre Lewton and Tourneur let the imagination of the viewer make up the horror, as everything is in the unseen. It was a device they would use in several films and it always worked. Lewton and Tourneur new that what we could imagine in our minds through cinematic suggestion was far worse than anything they could graphically show on screen.

Simone Simon, small and elegant, is perfect as the sweet Yugoslavian girl Irena Dubrovna, living in New York City and trying to fit in. Even after she meets and marries Oliver (Kent Smith) there is a shadow on her life which stands eerily between the happiness she desires and the curse she feels inside her.

A scene in a restaurant when ""one of her own kind"" recognizes the panther inside her is particularly unsettleing. Tom Conway is the doctor who tries to help and Jane Randolph has a nice part as Oliver's friend Alice. As Irene wrestles with her fear, Oliver begins to confide in Alice and it becomes obvious to Irena that there could be more. Her jealously may awaken the panther inside her and put all their lives in danger.

A film that is full of atmosphere and dripping with doom, there are some genuinely scary moments here. A scene late at night as Irena walks alone down the street, and a terrifying scene by a pool are both legendary. Simone Simon brought a fragile, and yes, cat like grace to the role. Tourneur lets the audience sense her fear and feel sorry for her tortured soul.

Now she must try to find some way to balance what she feels in her heart with the curse she carries.  With the help of her new friend she comes up with what she feels is the only solution.

While this film manages to remain fairly true to the original, even duplicating some scenes, it seems more concerned with sex than it does with the original story.  Nastasha could go around topless throughout the movie and hardly reveal more than she does with all her transparent clothing.  She also has a confusing change of personality when she stalks another character.  But all in all it manages to be a pretty good film and a fine tribute.

216782,1,630018286X,"For those who don't believe in vampires, all one needs to do is look at the movie Cat People.  At one time, this had been a great 1940s horror movie, but someone (or something!) got a hold of it and drained all the life from it.  The lifeless remnants of the original movie became this 1980s version, which seems to believe that all the classic version was missing was some blood and some nudity.

After a nice-looking but rather slow prologue involving women mating with panthers in the distant past, we come to the present where Irena (played by Natasha Kinski) is arriving in New Orleans from some foreign land.  There she meets her brother, played by Malcolm McDowell, whose interest in her goes well beyond sibling love.

Both are under a curse of sorts that forces them to turn into cats if they are sexually aroused (although for Irena, it doesn't occur until she actually completes the act).  In cat-form, they must kill before they can be restored to humanity.  Of course, soon enough, Irena falls in love and must deal with her curse.

Where the original movie succeeded with implied horror - things lurking in the shadows and similar suspense-generating effects - this movie puts it all out in front of the viewer.  Comparisons with the original aren't really necessary, however:  this dud fails on its own merits, especially from the greatest of all crimes a horror movie can suffer from:  it's often boring.  Add to that a distinctly '80s style and soundtrack, and this movie also looks extremely dated.  Stick with the original.",1134691200,12,1542,4.7518796992481205

216807,3,630018286X,"Perhaps the best known and most often imitated ""B"" movie of the 40s or of all-time Jacques Tourneur's ""Cat People"" like the main character has a lot going on underneath its surface.

 Drenched in atmosphere and sexuality ""Cat People"" tells the story of Irena Dubrovna, a foreigner who has arrived in America and meets Oliver Reed (Kent Smith) an all-America boy, he even eats apple pie!.

 Irena believes in a myth (?) about her people who turn into cats when they express any strong feelings or desires. In this movie it is mostly used as a reference to sex. After the two are married Oliver is not even allowed to kiss her.

 Oliver finds out about Irena's past and suggest she go see a doctor, (Tom Conway). But no one believes her story.

 The movie is somewhat slow. There is not a lot of action going on mostly subtle psychological and cultural refernces. Two people from different cultures, the American telling his wife she is wrong to hold her beliefs. When the movie starts to build up to the action I think it works best. Wait for the swimming pool scene. But mostly everything is a set-up for the action.

 Some may think it was a great artistic move that the Irena is never shown turning into the panther. Maybe it is, but we never doubt, or at least I never doubted, what she says is true.

 Jacques Tourneur had a very long career making these ""B"" movies (""I Walked with a Zombie"") and they were quite popular at the time. In fact this movie was so popular it inspired a sequel ""The Curse of the Cat People"" which Tourneur did not directed (Robert Wise did) but starred the same people except for Conway.

 Bottom-line: Great atmosphere but little action. Worthwhile if you are a Tourneur fan or like Hollywood ""B"" movies.",1120348800,,1737,4.5256410256410255
216808,5,630018286X,"Producer Val Lewton was forced to work with a small budget during his time with RKO, but faced with financial contraints and lack of star power, he hooked up with director Jacques Tourneur to create several horror films that many decades later are still considered the finest ever made in the genre. Cat People is one of those films.

Lewton and Tourneur did this by letting the imagination of the viewer make up the horror, as everything is in the unseen. It was a device they would use in several films and it always worked. Lewton and Tourneur new that what we could imagine in our minds through cinematic suggestion was far worse than anything they could graphically show on screen.

Simone Simon, small and elegant, is perfect as the sweet Yugoslavian girl Irena Dubrovna, living in New York City and trying to fit in. Even after she meets and marries Oliver (Kent Smith) there is a shadow on her life which stands eerily between the happiness she desires and the curse she feels inside her.

A scene in a restaurant when ""one of her own kind"" recognizes the panther inside her is particularly unsettleing. Tom Conway is the doctor who tries to help and Jane Randolph has a nice part as Oliver's friend Alice. As Irene wrestles with her fear, Oliver begins to confide in Alice and it becomes obvious to Irena that there could be more. Irena's jealously may awaken the panther inside her and put all their lives in danger.

A film that is full of atmosphere and dripping with doom, there are some genuinely scary moments here. A scene late at night as Irena walks alone down the street,  and a terrifying scene by a pool are both legendary. Simone Simon brought a fragile, and yes, cat like grace to the role.  Tourneur lets the audience sense her fear and feel sorry for her tortured soul.

216827,4,630018286X,"There's a pivotal scene in Vincente Minelli's ""The Bad and the Beautiful"" where Kirk Douglas and Barry Sullivan, portraying a fledgling Hollywood producer and director are given the task of making a horror movie with little more than a title (and a silly one at that). In a flash of desperate inspiration, they eschew the typical men-in-suits method that never works anyway, relying instead on the two oldest and most reliable special effects in filmaking: the Dark and the Imagination. Needless to say their film is a hit. I have no doubt this scene was a direct tribute to the careers and films of an unjustly obscure pair of visionaries, producer Val Lewton and director Jaques Tourneur and their most ""famous"" film, 1942's ""Cat People.""
Shot at RKO in under a month for less than $140,000, this dark little gem stars Simone Simon as Irena, a Serbian woman (immigrant? refugee?) who is convinced that her blood carries the curse of a race of European Satanist druids, and that any hint of passion, love, desire, anger, jealousy will turn her into a murderous cat-creature. The tiny, lovely Simon plays the role beautifully, with a fragile, feline grace that hints at something very dark (kinky?) lurking just underneath her almond-shaped eyes and alluring smile. Kent Smith plays her husband Oliver Reed rather woodenly by comparison, but Tourneur is smart enough not to try making him any deeper than a typical all-American boy type - at one point he describes his life as ""swell"" and somehow we don't laugh...maybe you could say stuff like that in the 40s.
DeWitt Bodeen's script efficiently zips through the boy-meets-girl part, but not without giving us things to think about. After brazenly inviting (luring?) Oliver to her apartment for tea after having just met, we soon find Irena humming an exotically European lullaby in the darkened room as Oliver lays on her sofa...though both characters are fully dressed and on opposite sides of the room, the feeling that something did/will/should/wants to happen is palpable. Particularly chilling is a moment when Irena and Oliver enter a pet shop only to find every single animal in the room shrieking with horror, the din ceasing the moment Irena opts to stand by herself in a pouring rain while Oliver shops in the now peaceful establishment. I've seen more graphic depictions of the excluded outsider, but none more poigniant. At a party thrown in honor of their engagement, a mysterious and beautiful stranger who ""looks like a cat"" according to one guest greets Irena as a familiar, saying something in a language only the two of them understand. It's a simple moment, but a dark one...dark because the audience realizes that Irena truly is something other than what she seems, and because the people around her don't believe it, something bad is going to happen.
This is when Tourneur and photographer Nicholas Musuraca do their work, mixing our own expectation of something awful with shadows, sounds and silence, standing by as we push our own buttons. Utterly normal things like walking to a bus stop, answering the phone, taking a swim and even having coffee and pie morph from the common into hair raising incidents. As we watch we're more frightened each time something dosen't happen, convinced that it's going to be really awful when it finally does. It isn't until the film's bittersweet finale, that we realize that Tourneur and Bodeen have been toying with our very conception of what scary is...conning us into scaring ourselves because we already know how.",1080172800,25,3530,4.974619289340102
216828,5,630018286X,"More often than not, it's much better to show nothing than anything at all.  Hitchcock knew this, and that's how he essentially became known as The Master of Suspense.  Had he shown Norman's ""mother"" from ""Psycho"" killing the girl in the shower in greater detail, the horror of the scene would have been more greatly ineffective as compared to just how haunting it is today.
Jacques Tourneur obviously understood this idea and used it to his advantage in ""Cat People.""  An experienced director of cult horror films from the 30s and 40s, Tourneur's story of a woman with a mysterious background still works as a pinnacle thriller sixty years later.  Movies like this aren't made anymore--and I mean that in a literal sense.  A more modern director would use bad CGI effects to reveal the ""cat woman"" for what she is, and I can only imagine how an idea like this would translate to the screen nowadays.  But the key to ""Cat People"" is that we never even see the cat people.  We don't see anything.  We don't want to see anything.
""A Kiss Could Change Her Into a Monstrous Fang-and-Claw Killer!"" boasted the tagline in 1942.  Of course, this is an ancient filmmaking technique for that age--symbolic of the loss of one's virginity, the essential background of the tale is rooted deeply in the nature and misconceptions of sexuality at the time.
The monogamy of it all is very subtle and, at first glance, nonexistent--but the deeper you look into the hints the clearer the signs appear.  Irena is not allowed to kiss a man or she changes into a monstrous beast.  A metaphor for loss of virginity and the result stemming from this is old folklore, and the film's use of Irena's background is more than just an explanation for her genetic traits--it is a way of creating the central idea that she lives in fear of her own background of sexuality.  It's as subtle and effective as the entire film's approach to horror.
Irena Dubrovna (Simone Simon) is a fashion artist living in New York City.  Born from a Serbian background, she lives under the impression that her own family's roots lie in an ancient curse of the ""cat people"" that were thrown out of a city in Serbia hundreds of years before.
Animals do indeed react strangely to her.  She is unable to enter into a pet store, because the squawks of scared birds and the barks of sensitive dogs drown out the entire area.  It is almost as if she is truly an animal.  When she is given a pet kitten, she takes it back and exchanges it for a bird.  The bird dies from fright weeks later.
When she meets Oliver Reed (Kent Smith) downtown in the city, she falls desperately and hopelessly in love, but the depression of her own fear of unleashing the cat within prevents her from coming in close contact with her own boyfriend--and eventual husband.
Left untouched by his own wife, Oliver eventually turns to his co-worker Alice Moore (Jane Randolph) for satisfaction (only lightly hinted at by the film), which ends up sparking a terrifying anger and hatred within Irena.  Hounded by a curious psychiatrist (Tom Conway) and feeling like an outcast around her own husband, Irena's inner cat is indeed released and wreaks brief havoc upon those around her.
We never see the cat, and we never see Irena's transformation into another species.  But, as I said before, it's much better--and certainly more effective--this way, as the suspense and mystery of the film propels it towards repeat viewings.  The movie is even a bit like ""Ginger Snaps,"" in a way, only it's certainly more moody and suspenseful.  And there aren't any fake-looking dog puppets in this version of the tale.
It's always pleasant to watch classic movies late at night on a Friday or Saturday night. No one cares about them anymore--cheap straight-to-video movies air on television earlier than the classics.  But these are the staples of every existing genre--specifically horror, when it comes to films like ""Cat People.""  These types of films should be appreciated much more than they have been in the past, say, sixty years.
""Cat People"" is an amazing achievement with a distinct sense of classic horror and a good dose of suspense.  If you like horror--or if you don't--this is a must-see film, and it is certainly one of the most memorable cult horror classics of all time, led by some great performances and a very talented director behind the camera.  What a treat.",1075507200,,4385,4.723097112860892
216829,5,630018286X,"""Cat People"" came out in 1982 and is a modern take on the 1942 version.

There's something about this flick that makes it engrossing. It has style and pizzazz. For instance, the flashback scenes of the ancient panther tribe doing rituals in an orange desert are surreal and captivating; the accompanying atmospheric music adds to the mood nicely.

Nastassja Kinski and Malcolm McDowell are siblings cursed to become were-panthers if sexually aroused. The only way they can become human again is to kill a fellow human. The idea is absurd and fantastical, but ""Cat People"" takes the subject absolutely seriously. John Heard plays  a zoo manager who falls in love with Kinski, while Annette O'Toole plays the third person in the romantic triangle.

The casting is great. Both Kinski and McDowell are properly cat-like. McDowell has a fittingly wierd and diabolic air about him. John Heard is fine and O'Toole is simply gorgeous.

If nudity offends you then you might want to skip this one as many of the characters are shown totally nude or near nude.

Kinski is indeed quite attractive (be on the lookout for the scene of her fishing with Heard in hot pants and wader boots) but I'm a bit perplexed by Heard's decision to drop O'Toole for Kinski. Check it out and see if you share my confusion; pay particular attention to the pool sequence.

One thing I don't get about the story is that it is established that cat people can only safely have sex with other cat people; therefore because Kinski and McDowell are the only cat people left they can only have sexual relations with each other (shudder). The problem is that it is revealed that other cat people DO exist as Kinski obviously runs into another cat person in the diner. If there are other cat people out there why would McDowell insist on having incestuous relations with his sister? Is he just a sick bastage or am I giving this too much thought?

Keep in mind that this is indeed a horror flick and it can be pretty brutal at times.",1068854400,5,1993,4.6581196581196584

216831,2,630018286X,"I'm not opposed to the idea of remakes, although this film shows just why it's a better idea to remake bad films with unfulfilled potential than great ones that far exceeded theirs. Even ignoring comparisons with Val Lewton's classic, it's rare for a film to misfire on quite as many levels as this early Bruckheimer movie - and it's much more of a Bruckheimer movie than a Schrader one - but sadly, like all Bruckheimer movies, this promises much but then resolutely fails to deliver (after all, Bruckheimer is the guy who made a car chase movie and then forgot to include any car chases until the last reel). The sexual fantasies may be Schrader's, but the style is all Bruckheimer's - glossy visuals, marketable soundtrack, good-looking cast given little to work with, meandering script and a dogged refusal to make good on the hype.

However, even ignoring the fact that the producer is more interested in the marketing than the movies themselves, taken on its own merits, `Cat People' just doesn't work. For a film about a race of incestuous cat people, it's astonishingly boring. Nothing much happens in the most uninteresting way possible for 90 minutes until Kinski's character undergoes a sudden complete moral u-turn and the filmmakers try to wrap everything up in a hurry so they can get home before the pubs shut. As a film about sexuality, it has no insight. As a sex film, it has no sex or eroticism. As a thriller, it doesn't thrill. As a horror film, it has no atmosphere or menace. Worst of all, it's just so astonishingly dull. And don't expect much in the way of special effects or gore - most of what was shot hit the cutting room floor (and don't go looking for them on the DVD - no deleted scenes there). Suddenly the omens for `Exorcist IV' are looking very, very bad indeed...

The DVD itself is a good package - a new 25-minute interview with Schrader and a worrying one from 1982 where he's barely coherent and obviously under the influence; interview with make-up FX man Tom Burman; Robert Wise on Val Lewton; stills montage; trailer; and an audio commentary by Schrader. Absolutely none of which makes this film any better, but at least gives you some insight into how Schrader's admitted personal problems helped send it off the rails.

The gender role of women to be chaste and not at all sexual is taken to the extreme - if Irena gets hot and bothered, she'll turn into a ferocious cat and kill her husband. However, jealousy also triggers this transformation, leading the movie's most suspenseful and artistically shot sequences. While I love old horror movies, I know that by today's standards they aren't considered very scary or supsenseful.

Fans of THE HUNGER or VAMPYROS LESBOS will find themselves in familiar territory.  This is a sexy excercise in style over substance, but what a great fun ride it is.  Schrader gives us depth in a genere much maligned for being very dumbed down.  He pulls no punches as the graphic scenes of sex and violence push the envelope of any censors.  Shy about gore and full frontal nudity?  You should skip this title.

216837,4,630018286X,"A fun, hokey horror flick about a weird-looking Croatian gal (Simone Simon) who carries an old-world curse that prevents her from falling in love, lest her passion turn her into a man-eating were-panther. In case the plot's psychological ramifications were lost on you the first time around, the cast also includes a suave psychiatrist, who gets hired by the cat lady's frustrated newlywed husband, to tell her that these marital problems are all in her head. He finds out differently when her strange allure leads him into some rather unprofessional doctor-patient relations: kiss-kiss, claw-claw!! Naturally, this B-movie classic has plenty of screamingly hilarious MST3K-worthy moments, particularly around the strained domestic life of the newlywed couple. It also has some nice ""serious"" cinematic touches, particularly the moody B&W photography.
[NOTE: the sequel, ""Curse Of The Cat People,"" is even better, although the whole were-cat thing is pretty much left out of the plot.  Another cool, psychologically-oriented Val Lewton production... Also, this first film was remade in a more sexually explicit 1982 version starring Natassja Kinski as the cat lady. Meow!]

216838,4,630018286X,"""Cat People"" blends the eerie with the erotic, benefiting from a literate script and artsy production values. Universal, eager to mine its horror properties as the genre came back strong during the late 1970s, decided to remake some of its classics, notably ""The Thing"" (also in 1982). The studio turned to Paul Schrader for an update of Val Lewton's 1942 ""Cat People."" Universal has released the film as a widescreen DVD with plenty of extras...
Schrader, riding high on the success of ""American Gigolo,"" wasn't a fan of the original film and later tried to have the remake retitled. He saw the project as a chance to ""work on my control of the visual language."" The project ended up being ""as personal or more personal than any film I'd done,"" the director says in his excellent commentary.
Key to Schrader's vision was Italian production designer Ferdinando Scarfiotti (""The Last Emperor""). Schrader even tried to tag ""Cat People"" as ""A Film by Paul Schrader and Ferdinando Scarfiotti."" The detail-obsessed Italian ultimately was credited as a ""visual consultant"" because of his union status.
Shot largely in New Orleans, ""Cat People"" stars Malcolm McDowell and Nastassja Kinski as siblings cursed to live as half-leopards. The sensual and sometimes silly film ended up ""more skin than blood,"" Schrader admits. Kinski's nude scenes should bring out the animal in most male viewers -- including the one that inspired that poster with the snake.
Schrader spins some great yarns. Cocaine fueled much of the production. The director became obsessed with the young Kinski. Handlers wrangled dangerous leopards, losing one manic cat in the process. Scarfiotti hid his sets until shooting.
The director points out a lot that's not apparent, such as the ambitious sets and John Whitlock's beautiful matte paintings, created at the dawn of the CG era. The matte work's transformation of the sets is demonstrated on the disc. Other extras include Schrader's recent docu ""Cat People: An Intimate Portrait,"" a breakdown of Tom Burman's pre-CG special effects and director Robert Wise paying tribute to original ""Cat"" man Lewton.
Images are decent for a film of that era. Some outdoor shots have a MOW haze, but the set work looks fine. There is limited speckling. Giorgio Moroder's synth scores comes through strong and sure in Dolby Digital. The package says the audio is 2.0, but there is clearly surround encoding.",1032825600,4,2408,5.0987341772151895
216839,4,630018286X,"""Cat People"" is a nifty horror thriller that stands as a model of economy. Producer Val Lewton is said to have been given a miniscule budget for the movie. It was shot by director Jacques Tourneur in less than thirty days. It is a tribute to these men that the movie remains quite watchable sixty years later.
The story is simple: A young man named Oliver [Kent Smith] meets Irena [Simone Simon] at the big cat exhibit of a zoo. She's from a small Russian village. [Simon was, in fact, French.] They fall in love, but Irena is terrified of even kissing Oliver because of a legend that says passion could turn her into a leopard. Despite the obvious drawbacks of such a phobia, Oliver marries her. Eventually, he and his friend, Alice [Jane Randolph], who is secretly in love with him, convince the bride to see a psychiatrist, Dr. Judd [Tom Conway]. Naturally, all three characters believe Irena's problem is a psychological one. Her persistent rejection of the patient Oliver and her increasingly erratic behavior causes him to turn to Alice. This causes Irena to become increasingly jealous and paranoid. Soon enough we find out that her fears about what she can turn into are horrifyingly real.
As a horror film, ""Cat People"" is naturally tame by today's standards, but it is still creepier and more suspenseful than much of today's fare. The camera work and the lighting are first rate, as are the sets, all of which were probably recycled from other productions. Though none of the four leads ever became a star, they were very competent character actors who enjoyed successful careers. Tourneur continued to specialize in modestly budgeted suspense and horror movies and was well regarded in the industry. Lewton died of a heart attack in 1951 in his forties.
If you study the movie, you can see how many corners were cut, though these do not detract from one's enjoyment of it. A handful sets serve as the background for the bulk of the scenes. For example, when Oliver first meets Irena, she invites him into her apartment for tea. After they marry, he moves into her place. The only reason I can think of for his doing so is that no additional sets were needed for either his home or a new one for the couple.
Despite a few flaws, most of them related to its low budget, ""Cat People"" is both a fun movie and a thrilling one. Recommended. [Not to be confused with the 1982 version. Although the update has merits of its own, it in no way resembles the original in either tone or style.]",1026172800,11,2494,4.61936936936937

216843,5,630018286X,"This wonderful admixture of horror, irony , lust, and romance set against an unremarkable  and down tempo Louisiana background has Kinski and McDowell at the peak of their performing ability. Sterling performances  in secondary roles by O'toole and Heard round out a beguiling tale of unrequitable love against a beautifully pitched  Georgio Moroder soundtrack ( available on CD).
After 26 viewings of the movie , I'm still totally captivated by Kinski's subtle naivety, and total, total beauty. She only ever looked better in 'Hotel New Hampshire'. She gets some ironic lines like "" Oh, I don't eat meat"", and the opportunity to give us just enough exposure to invoke lustful thoughts for decades to come .
While the movie has some explicit content, there is much about it that is beautifully shot ( the crabbing scene with Kinski in waders and ultra high hot pants) and very, very sexy.
Cat people contains all the elements of a good thriller: People coming to the jolting realisation that everything they believed about the way the world is, is demonstrably wrong; powerful physical attraction that has consequences beyond the realm of human mortality ; the realisation that we are all to some extent prisoners of our own animal nature.
Cat people is in no way 'sensational' but builds the story as a slow investigation of the relationships between Zoo curator ( Heard  ) recent arrival to New Orleans ( Kinski ) and her tortured and seemingly demented brother ( McDowell).
Special effects are minimal and used with a necessary discretion, as the true nature of Irene ( Kinski) and her brother , Paul ( McDowell ) makes itself apparent.

216845,4,630018286X,"Producer Val Lewton is reknowned for the psychological subtlety of his horror films, and CAT PEOPLE is considered his earliest triumph.  The well-known story concerns a European beauty named Irena (Simone Simon) who reluctantly falls in love with All-American Oliver Reed (Kent Smith)--and after marriage confesses consumation will cause her to transform into a ravening beast.  Husband Oliver wastes little time in placing Irena under psychiatric care.  After all, she is clearly suffering from a mental illness brought on by [past] repression... CAT PEOPLE is particularly famous for several complex sequences that build suspense on indistinct shadows and faintly heard sound...
From a modern standpoint, the film's script, set-pieces, and performances are more than a little dated, and some scenes that set 1942 audiences screaming may actually pass unnoticed.  Although charming, Simone Simon lacks the sultry edge we expect of a ""cat woman""... and leading man Kent Smith is merely servicable; still, Jane Randolph, as Smith's business associate, and Tom Conway, as Irena's doctor, are very effective--as are the bit players, including Elizabeth Russell in a truly sinister cameo.  Because of the way in which the film has dated, I do not recommend it to the casual viewer--but Lewton fans and those interested in the development of horror and suspense genres cannot afford to miss one, and for them it is very highly recommended indeed.",1015027200,6,1441,5.386666666666667
216846,4,630018286X,"In general terms, the basic premise of both original 1942 CAT PEOPLE and the 1982 Paul Schrader remake are the same: an exotic European beauty is given to transforming into a black panther when sexually aroused.  But Schrader unravels this fantasy concept in some very Freudian directions, setting his version in against the decadent charm of New Orleans, introducing a theme of incest, and ramping up the original with a lot of nudity, a lot of sex, and some of the most graphic violence around.  The result is an American blood-and-gore horror film with a hypnotic European sensibility that equates both sexual frustration and orgasm with violent death.  The story line concerns two orphaned siblings (Natasha Kinski and Malcom McDowell) who are reunited in New Orleans as adults-but they are, unbeknownst to the sister, the descendents of a mutant race who can only mate with their own kind without transforming into ravening beasts who must then kill to regain their human form.  When sister Natasha rejects her brother's advances and then falls in love with a hunky zoo director all hell breaks loose.

In some respects the film is extremely, extremely frustrating, often sliding over the edge from a sexually provocative shocker into moments of annoying silliness-but on the whole it works extremely well as a both a sexual fantasy and the penultimate statement in gratuitous sex and violence.  Kinski is ideally cast as the sexy but virginal Irena; you can literally see the ""cat"" side of her nature emerge more and more as the film progresses.  McDowell is equally interesting as her mad brother, and John Heard, Annette O'Toole, and particularly Ruby Dee offer excellent performances in the supporting cast.  The New Orleans backdrop is extremely effective, and (speaking as one who has been there) the darker side of the city is perfectly captured; the Moroder score-which includes some sultry vocals by David Bowie-is also extremely good.

A great many people will loathe CAT PEOPLE, and the reasons will be diverse.  The film is extremely bloody, often to a can-you-stand-to-look-at-the-screen degree; there is tremendous nudity and considerably sexual activity; and the combination of sex and violence into a sadomasochistic eroticism is quite disturbing.  Beyond this, more critically inclined viewers may find themselves annoyed by the script's occasional silliness and the fact that it does not always go as far over the top as it leads you to expect, and the film's very literal depiction of fantasy elements will certainly not to be every taste.  But if you have a hunger to walk on the wild side, CAT PEOPLE (which is rapidly gaining status as a cult film) will suit your need as guilty pleasure.  A personal favorite.

216849,4,630018286X,"Cat People is the first of Val Lewton's celebrated horror series for RKO. The studio may have thought throw-away escapism for war time audiences, but Lewton had more ambitious designs. Results in this initial entry are uneven, brought down by obvious budget constraints and a lacklustre cast. Physically, Simone Simon is a good choice for cat woman with her kittenish features and seductive smile, but the demands of the role are simply beyond her thespic powers. The real cat woman, Elizabeth Russell, shows up in the cafe scene to scare the daylights out of everyone including the audience. Too bad we don't see her again.
Nonetheless, the hallmarks of the series are already in place -- imaginative scripts , literary prologues and epilogues, sudden shocks, creative use of sound , but above all, the use of atmosphere to imply horror without actually showing it (Lewton had to fight the studio on this one). Implied horror especially requires a high level of artistry , which helps explain why so few film makers of today even attempt it. All are present in Cat People, with results that are both entertaining and interesting despite the drawbacks. And, oh yes, for those interested in the more academic side of movies, whether intentional or not, there is a mother lode of symbolism lurking in the subtext of this film, which I'm happy to say doesn't detract from the entertainment value one whit.",1007856000,4,1402,4.919831223628692
216850,4,630018286X,"The original b&w Cat People (and it's sequel) are extremely tame compared with this erotic-charged version.  Indeed, the originals are downright boring compared to this.  The reason?  For one thing Kinski is absolutely striking and even distracting.  Sorry, but I'm a guy, and Nastassja Kinski was at her most sexy during this period.  With those big eyes, luscious lips and...ump, everything else, it's tough to keep up with the flow of the story without your eyes becoming transfixed on her loveliness.  What's here is beyond the obvious soft porn feel; but a fine horror outing in the same vein as AMERICAN WEREWOLVE IN LONDON.  Kinski is suitably virgin-esque and McDowell suitably slimy.  The visuals are very effective but surprisingly limited.  The black cats are amazing to watch throughout.  Scored by David Bowie and Giorgio Moroder, the music is sufficently creepy and memorable.
As for the DVD version, the picture is mostly good.  The sound is a little lacking.  There were times when I had to turn it all the way up to hear. Other time I'd get my eardrums blown off.

I felt such immense pity for the Serbian girl's plight, and very little sympathy for her American husband and future second wife, and so the movie struck me as incredibly sad rather than frightening.

The image and sound quality are pretty good, and the movie is an interesting remake of the 1942 Val Lewton classic, but this DVD version is not worth the money.  If you haven't yet seen this erotic thriller, I recommend you rent the DVD or VHS tape, or buy the cheaper VHS version.  One can only hope that this DVD is no longer available from the studio because they are reworking it to make a collectible DVD edition!
Paul Schrader's remake has the gorgeous 21 year old Nastassia Kinski as the troubled Irena, and she has several very nice nude scenes.  Too many, in fact, according to her.  She tried to get Schrader to cut some of them, but fortunately he didn't.  And there is also the lovely Annette O'Toole, whose nude scene in the locker room is one of the highlights of the movie.  And when the lights go out while she's alone in the swimming pool and she hears the growls of an unseen creature all around her--well, it's pretty spooky!
That scene and another, when the streetcar* stops in front of O'Toole with a loud cat-like snarl, are scary and reminiscent of the original moody and atmospheric film, where all was suggested but nothing was shown--everything was left to the imagination.  That was not just art, though--it was mostly because of the minuscule budget Lewton had!  Today everything is shown and nothing is left to the imagination--which is good, too.  Times change, and so do movies!

7804022,5,630018286X,"The Original CAT PEOPLE was a masterpiece of black and white atmospheric film work, where what you don't see is scarier than what you might. With a tough act like that to follow, Paul Schrader has made a masterpiece of (then) updated rework that takes elements of the original to places you simply couldn't back in the days of censorship. Because of that, the sexual tension in the air of this film is almost overwhelming, and the main reason why it works is because of Nastassja Kinski, who, undoubtedly, was simply one of the most beautiful women in the world at that time.

But in this case, she is aided and abetted by some formidable performances:  the incredible Malcolm McDowall , who, in all his movements in the film, makes you believe he is really a cat;  Ruby Dee , who on the surface smiles and laughs but underneath, knows the horror of what is going on, but is a trooper in what she does, as guardian of this strange beast.  John Heard, unfortunately, passed away today, with yet another great performance as the believable curator of the zoo, who, naturally, simply cannot resist the aura of Kinski, in spite of her strangeness and edginess.

Annette O'Toole, quite the beauty herself, who also radiates sexual charm, and hopelessly pines for John Heard, who is otherwise pre-occupied with the irresistible charms of Ms. Kinski...All of this supporting cast is finally buoyed by an incredible musical score by Giorgio Moroder, with some haunting melodies that I have listened to hundreds of time, and played on my keyboards that much more.
