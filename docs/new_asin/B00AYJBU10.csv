8559274,4,B00AYJBU10,"This obviously low budget movie has lots of good, funny and touching moments, all happening in a slice of the life of an aging couple confronted with the need to leave their long-term home. Much of the dialogue appears to be improvisation, well handled by Eliott Gould and the other old pros who make up the cast -- all excellent in their roles. Based, sort of, on the true story of the couple who actually owned the home the movie is filmed in -- and the home is, itself, a character in the movie, a period piece frozen in time.",1377216000,2,529,4.3
