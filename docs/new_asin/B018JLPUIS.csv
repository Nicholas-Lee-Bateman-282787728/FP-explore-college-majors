7553477,5,B018JLPUIS,"Really love this series. Bought this DVD so I could watch it at my leisure rather than staying up so late to see it on TV. Just received it recently and couldn't stop watching it. I have seen it all the way thru, but no spoiler alert here. It's a great series. Great writing, acting and character progression.",1461628800,9,309,4.344827586206897
7553478,5,B018JLPUIS,"This show keeps you on the edge of your seat for almost the entire hour. Dramatic, witty, funny and really good acting. The script is fantastic. It's  a perfect combination of good stuff! I'm disappointed in Alex for sleeping with her old boy friend. I guess she doesn't remember what he did to her before. Can't wait for the next episode.",1461369600,2,339,4.557377049180328
7553479,5,B018JLPUIS,"I love this show! I love the fact it's not just another medical drama, the ghost twist makes it stand out from the others. It's done in a way that is believable, and campy and silly! Truly enjoy it! I hope they never lose the twist other wise it will be just like the rest!",1461283200,5,273,3.981818181818182

7553491,5,B018JLPUIS,"Solid series - enjoy it immensely.  Most of the medical drama seems like it is really done well.  It's not too gory - Michael Shanks plays his role perfectly and just like in Smallville, sometimes you just want to ask where some people's brains are (obviously their pants) but for the most part - the characters are endearing and you care what happens to them.  I don't want to spoil anything but I'm still crying over the last episode even if it didn't do the research on how the damn thing worked.  One of the few medical dramas I can stomach because it is more drama than medical marvel gross just to be gross and please people who like gross and leave out people who might want to eat a sandwich in front of the TV.",1490400000,,719,4.264705882352941
7553492,5,B018JLPUIS,"*** SPOILERS ***

Wow, this season was a roller coaster.  Watching it live I remember being riled up after almost every episode and constantly changing my loyalties on the relationship front.  But after all is said and done I still think this was a solid season full of interesting medical cases and ghost stories and amazing performances from the actors.

What we didn't know heading into Season 3 was that the writers had two major curveballs thrown at them: Erica Durance would be 7-8 months pregnant by the end of the season and Daniel Gillies was not only leaving the show but requested that his character be killed off.  So looking back and rewatching the season, the tumultuous middle episodes aren't quite as rediculous or mind-boggling.  I really think the writers were trying to give Daniel/Joel a proper send off and Joel fans something to hope for and possibly remember him by.

The beautiful but tragic finale perfectly winds up this season and sets the stage for the next one.

The best feature on the DVD is definitely the Psychic Healing web series,which never found its way onto YouTube.  The Great Randall is a temporary resident at Hope Zion, and all the doctors pay him a visit for readings, hypnosis, and advice on their personal and professional lives.  Sometimes we see brief flashes of what's to come, other times we are treated to flashbacks of the characters' pasts.  The whole 12 episode series is around 45 minutes, and I dig out this DVD just to watch it now and then.",1488067200,,1497,4.719230769230769
7553493,5,B018JLPUIS,"Great show!  I love it. Yet the continual repeating of the episodes in a season becomes aggravating. The last new episode I saw was when Charlie underwent brain surgery to remove the ""ghosts"" he sees and speaks to. In the preview of the next episode, Alex and Charlie are at a special dinner. Before Alex goes to the podium to speak, Tom, I think his name is, the one Charlie believed did kill his wife, enters the room. He sees Charlie and goes to him whipping out a pistol and shoots him in the heart or the head. What happened?  Did Charlie die? I would like to see this episode. If Charlie did die is this the end of the series?",1487289600,,632,4.214876033057851

When my relative saw the serie in xion channel, called me and I started searching for it. I found it on Prime Video and bought it.

I just pray that the quality of the show lasts awhile. Great show and characters. Great writing. Most impressed with Alex character who could so easily be overwritten or who could over-act.

Season 3 continues the romantic entanglements of the staff at the Hope Zion hospital, along with some terrific medical stories. All with the added benefit of this being based in Canada, which means that we don't have to sit through heart-wrenching stories of everyday people and the financial gymnastics they have to go through to pay for life-saving procedures their insurance won't cover.

8742555,3,B018JLPUIS,"As a retired doc, the medical procedures etc on this show are the WORST I have EVER seen on a 'medical drama'. Besides BLATANTLY copying the patient types of Greys anatomy, the medical realism goes down-the-drain of the scrub sinks where the surgeons scrub with no scrub, no soap, a dash of water and use their hands wrung together instead of a brush. (You cannot TOUCH hands while scrubbing, you use a scrub brush) Te docs wear NURSING SCRUBS, long hems with pockets and tailored--docs wear scrubs tucked in. That was the most infuriating part. Then you watch them shock a flatline patient (you only shock arrhythmia (heart rhythm abnormalities)), 'bag' a patient without holding the mask to an airtight seal (it just sits on the face unattended)...REALLY BAD MEDICINE. why couldn't they have invested in a medical consultant? Geez.....

That said, i loved the premise of OOB (out of body) travel (they call them 'ghosts' however which is weird since they know they are not, usually) I have had this experience myself as well as many patients and I never discounted it as hallucinations.

I found the storyline really cool but the teary eyed women--all the female docs cry and cry watery eyed. As a female trauma surgeon myself? I found that DISGUSTING, a total stereotypical portrayal of a female in a male job shown to be NOT equal with her counterparts due to her emotional liability. Crap.

THE ORIGINAL IDEA? ORIGINAL! Too bad they could not have done better scripts, better portrayal of women in medicine (one is date-raped too and doesn't fight back at ALL and doesn't report it til WAY later)...and just make it smarter, less tearful, and more fun. They just needed better writers!!!",1534809600,,1692,4.8477508650519034
