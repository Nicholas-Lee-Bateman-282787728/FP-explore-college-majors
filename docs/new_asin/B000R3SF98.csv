8198763,2,B000R3SF98,"Not a bad production, if you don't mind having zero mystery in a Sherlock Holmes mystery. We know from the very beginning who committed the crime and why, which takes away a lot of the interest and makes Holmes's deductions seem behind the game instead of in front of it. Most of the story is sped up weirdly. Very nice production values though.",1523923200,,345,4.492063492063492

8198765,3,B000R3SF98,"To maintain my integrity I did not watch this edition all the way through, in fact I skipped to the end to notice if this production was inline with the book, and it was not. In the book Dr. Watson married Miss Morstan, therefore becoming Watson's first wife. In the book as Holmes and the Inspector were in the police boat chasing Mr. Small, Small had tossed the treasure in to the Thames therefore leaving Holmes and the Inspector with an empty box.",1521331200,,451,4.445783132530121
8198766,5,B000R3SF98,"My wife and I LOVED Ian Richardson, up there with Basil Rathbone and Benedict Cumberbatch. This is wonderfully done, perfectly set, am now looking for more of anything Ian Richardson did!",1521244800,4,187,5.064516129032258

8198768,5,B000R3SF98,Of course it is always said but for the hundreth time: Ian Richardson is perhaps the best of all Holmses on screen. The film shows a very colourful and amazing version of the classic by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. But no more  talking - watch it. The game is afoot!,953337600,13,261,4.22
8198769,5,B000R3SF98,"Brilliant! Ian Richardson really does bring Holmes to life in this entertaining and clever adaption of 'The Sign of Four'. A brilliant story of pygmies, jewels and wooden legs, plus the usual amazing deductions made  by Holmes with the help of Dr. Watson.  Great viewing!",948067200,11,271,5.0
