There's not an ounce of ego here, in fact, when Mercurio states the themes from his movie examples, he stresses that this is his interpretation, and yours may be different. He's more about looking at the dilemma and actions and then determining your theme from them. The zoo story was to underline a very important point that just flew way over his head.
Mercurio does suggest that it's for more advanced writers because as he states, ""Before getting to theme you have to be a polished storyteller, know and innovate the genre you're writing in."" Meaning, learn how to write good dialogue, tight scenes, dynamic characters etc. before addressing themes. I don't think this is far from what other writers would say in terms of having had to write a dozen screenplays before knowing what they were doing. Typically the Theme is discovered and developed after you have written the screenplay and this DVD does an excellent job of explaining how this is done by giving examples from such films as LA Confidential, Million Dollar Baby, Sophie's Choice, Eight Mile, etc. (vs. the beat to death use of Chinatown) and goes on to explain how subplots relate and can enhance the theme, which is a topic few if any instructors address.",1205798400,,1263,4.798165137614679
8100281,2,B000CQCAQY,"the lecturer turns off the listener by cryptically disuading you unless you've already completed and polished 5 screenplays.  Even if you've already done that -- you may be turned off by his fragmented train of thought (psychoanalysis -- his trip to the zoo -- his bad relationships...).  Somewhere in all this jargon are a few basic principles on theme,  but you have to put up with a lot of posturing to get to it.  Speaking too rapidly, the lecture does not necessarily  say alot.  I would stick to the better lecture by Michael Ray Brown,  and write from your heart.",1205366400,,570,4.64
8100282,5,B000CQCAQY,"I highly recommend this DVD to all serious writers in any field (even though it's primarily for screenwriters). As a writing student, one often hears instructors speak about theme, but it's always passed over in one or two sentences. Here, James Mercurio knowledgeably discusses and explains ""Theme"" at length. Mercurio speaks clearly and is easy to follow. It's a useful tool for writers who want an in depth look at theme.",1184025600,,424,4.985915492957746
