171154,5,0842375619,"Wow!!!! Since the commandments had been taken out of schools and public places, it is a delight to know there are ways to bring the laws of God to the hearts of the children. My family finds them a delight to watch. It reminds the children to keep Gods Laws in their heart. I loved every moment of them

Thank you",1168128000,20,313,4.131147540983607
171155,5,0842375619,"I knew this was a great series after reading some of the comments by Josh McDowell and other famous Christian writers. I was concerned about video-quality on a Hi-Definition set yet once I started the first DVD I was relieved. This set would probably be a great homeschooling tool for parents who want to introduce their kids to the fundamentals of God's Law.
The downside is the shortness of the episodes. All 5 (a little over 20 minutes each) should have easily fit on one single DVD instead of 5. But then the price would have been lower and what's good for the consumer may not be good for the studio.",1146441600,59,605,4.45945945945946

171158,2,0842375619,"I have watched these when I was younger and enjoyed them. My family owns them on VHS. I am the old-fashioned type who likes VHS's better than DVD's. I really wish VHS's were still being made.

I agree this is a good Chrisitan kid show that teaches important things about God's Ten Commandments. It is absolutely important to follow them in the correct way! I do feel sorry, though, for the life Seth has, with his dad dead, and living in the desert alone with his mother. He might have a sad life. Again, I think this is a good show for young Christian kids to learn from about God's Ten Commandments.

As a seventeen year old boy, my favorite tv show is Little House on the Prairie. It is a show a lot of Christians enjoy watching, and I recommend it.",1480118400,,752,4.288732394366197

171205,1,0842375619,"The story starts by using animal characters with biblical names. They have unbelievably bad behavior and are argumentative with each other. I get they are trying to build a story, but do we have to add talking animals with horrid behavior to tell the story?  Some of the voices for the people are done with strange accents, so hokey!  Stick to the Bible story, that's all we need!  My husband and I previewed the first 10 minutes and had to turn it off! Not for our kids. I'm surprised this got decent ratings;  in my opinion people watch so much garbage on TV they don't know a good show anymore.",1405987200,11,597,4.4

171209,3,0842375619,The story itself is great along with the singing.  The reason I am only giving it 3 stars is because it comes in a 3 disc set and two of them you have to flip over. They could have gotten all the stories on one DVD or bluray which would have made it a lot easier than switching out every 30 minutes or so.,1402617600,,305,3.765625

171213,5,0842375619,I purchased this to show my Pre-school sunday school class when we were going to start studying the 10 commandments. It has 3 DVDs (2 sided) and they are the perfect length for a sunday school class period. The kids loved this!,1396396800,,227,4.428571428571429
171214,3,0842375619,"The stories and animation are great. However, each little film is so short, there is no need for them to be on five separate discs. It's annoying (guess I'm lazy) to have to go change the discs out when they're over. Could have all been put on 1-2 discs.",1396137600,8,254,4.204081632653061
171215,5,0842375619,"We are Seventh-day Adventist and try to limit TV watching to Bible-related videos on Saturday the Sabbath each week.  This of course is not typically as fun to our kids as watching other things during the week, so I'm excited when I find something that's good quality AND teaches the Bible or about Jesus in a fun way that they enjoy.  Since buying this a couple of months ago, they wake up on Sabbath morning and the first thing they say is, ""Can we watch the 10 Commandments?""  Yay!  The songs are catchy and its put in a way that they can understand (although would be even better for 6-9 year olds).  It sure helps to explain to them why we keep the Sabbath when it's one of the 10 commandments they feature.

We also highly recommend The Jesus Movie and the related Bible story DVD set you can buy from that producer -- those are great too, although more appropriate for 2-6 year olds.  Ours loved those for the last couple of years.",1393977600,9,938,4.35632183908046

171217,5,0842375619,Great dvd to enhance the learning of the 10 commandments. It teaches the commandments by applying it to a story of the people who are with Moses.

I thought that after caerful search that i had the right one, the heading was titled ""super book"" but this is not the one that I was looking for.

I am a huge fan also......the stories are built around one little boy and told in a way that keeps my 3yr old grandsons attention completely!

171235,5,0842375619,"This is a great series that really explains the Ten Commandments to the children and gives them examples. Its fun and the songs are catchy. My girls love watching the whole thing all the way through. It opens the door for a lot of in depth conversations about sin and the consequences and also its give me opportunities to share the Gospel with them,how we are all born in sin,enemies to God without anyway to reconcile ourselves to Him. Jesus the Christ came from heaven to be born of a virgin,fully man and yet fully God,to live a perfect sinless life that through His death on Calvary's cross where God poured out His wrath onJesus that we deserved,and yet death could not hold Him and He rose victorious on the third day and sits at the right hand of the Father,our account would be settled with God. And those who repent of their sin(to turn away from and no longer take part in)and believe in Jesus for the salvation of their souls and forgiveness of sins,would be saved from Hell and eternal damnation.

I did not like the first episode because I felt the took an actual Scripture story and twisted it with their own ideas and added thing, but the other 4 episodes were just cute stories with Scriptural truths used for building character.

Hard to make out the theme song's lyrics...audio a bit unclear. Theme music a bit  dated. Released 2003 which makes sense why the animation reminds me of Disney's Aladdin. Great story lines of course; straight from bible. At times I wished the principles taught & the music were delivered in a livelier manner. Great for 3yrs old & up. A little slow (drags) for 3 & under. I would've given dvd 5 stars if it were a bit more engaging w/ viewer & livelier (upbeat in music & character personalities),",1359417600,3,629,4.616071428571429

171243,5,0842375619,I'm happy with my purchase and my toddler likes it too. I feel like my son needs some change in his entertainment so it's not all secular but also truths that will build up Godly Values in him and this dvd set is a good start. The cartoon intro is a bit cheesey but the cartoon it self is good. The price is good too :),1347062400,,319,3.8484848484848486
171244,5,0842375619,"This is one of the best purchases I have ever made on Amazon!  My kids love this series!  My 2 year old asks to watch Seth and Moses all of the time. It's entertaining, does a great job explaining the commandments for little kids and is a wonderful conversation starter.  The animation is really good ... I've seen other biblical dvds for kids and the animation was very poor.  I am very impressed with this series and wish there were more like this.",1341360000,,450,4.385542168674699

171246,5,0842375619,"I had wanted to show the Ten Commandments to children ages 5-10 but needed something on their level.  I don't usually use cartooned material in teaching but I read your positive reviews and took a chance.  I was so overwhelming satisfied with the Complete Collection Kids' Ten Commandments.  At first I ordered DVD and a week later found I needed a VCR set.  You shipped the VCR's in just a few days and I was able to cancel the DVD order with no trouble.  My husband and I have watched all 5 videos twice and I have ben able to make at least 10 questions for my movie class from each Commandment presented.  The subtle way in which ""life lessons"" are introduced through the animals in the stories are tremendous.  And the lessons are repeated in different forms throughout the series.  I couldn't have asked for a better product to show my small class.  They will know the Ten Commandments at the end of 5 weeks and they will know them by heart as well as what each one stands for.  Plus, along the way, we'll get to discuss selfishness, bullying, how important we each are to God, and so much more!  Thank you for this series.  I will order more of them.",1338249600,17,1156,4.375586854460094
171247,5,0842375619,"Each episode focuses on 2 of the commandments and creates a beautiful storyline to help everyone understand the concept.  For example, keeping the Sabbath day holy and not swearing/taking the Lord's name in vain are grouped together.  An older man forces a boy and his animals to work on the Sabbath and he continues to ""swear by God.""  The boy and the animals sing and remind him of the commandments.  Later Moses comes to the man and reprimands him.  It gets accross a serious message that children understand and then can apply to their lives.  The music is catchy and fun to sing along with.  I have 5 kids ages 2-10 and they love the videos.  We have watched them over and over in our home and gave them to cousins this year for Christmas.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kids-Ten-Commandments-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B004GGQMTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kids' Ten Commandments: The Complete Collection</a>",1325289600,16,952,5.608391608391608

7793088,2,0842375619,"First, I thought this series would teach kids how to follow the Ten Commandments -- meaning that each story would illustrate the applicability of a commandment to modern times.  I don't need an animated movie to tell my children the story of Moses and the burning bush, or what happened when Moses returned to the Israelites and discovered that they had fashioned an idol to worship:  there are illustrated children's bibles for that purpose.  But there are not many good resources to show children how to apply the commandments today, in modern situations.

Second, just because kids are young does not mean they are stupid and like stories that are idiotic and 'dumbed down.'  Accordingly, the talking animals really rubbed me the wrong way.  I also rolled my eyes at the inclusion of two 'Broadway production' numbers (first when the calf sings about how famous he is going to be and second when the 'evil doer' and a woman dressed like a harem girl sing a duet and (literally) do a soft-shoe dance in front of the golden idol.  Gag me.  Both are completely unnecessary for the telling of the story and weren't very interesting.

Parents:  get your children a nicely illustrated Children's Bible and skip this ridiculous series which is only LOOSELY based on the Bible.",1503964800,4,1272,4.820276497695852
