8329193,5,B001O3M36G,"Here's an interesting  and worthwhile Double Feature Film Set DVD. The films are ""Breach"" and ""The Chamber."" Both are serious drama and not a mere vehicle for  entertainment. Don't get me wrong. I tend to prefer entertaining films. ""Breach"" examines our security  system while ""The Chamber"" looks over our justice system. Both films are educational and thought provoking.

""Breach"" is based on a real case wherein our security system had a flaw that resulted in the deaths of about 50 U.S. agents who had infiltrated the Soviet KGB. Ryan Phillippe was assigned the task of keeping track of FBI agent Chris Cooper until his ultimate arrest. Most of the action is in the form of dialog in the office, car and home. Death and destruction are at a minimum for a spy saga.

""The Chamber"" is much the same way. Most of the action is in talking and dramatic court scenes with a lot of racial overtones. There's little in the way of fisticuffs and gunfire, although one dramatic and sickening explosion scene is repeated at least a half dozen times. It's a dramatic case in which there are no winners. My feelings are that it's probably true to the 60s times it depicts.

Both of these films tend to be  deep and thought provoking. They're not entertainment-only films. Both are well acted and directed. My favorite was ""The Chamber"" and I gave it  five stars. The ""Breach"" film was given a strong  four stars. With both of them together on the same package, I'd rate the package as five stars and one of the better double features available.
