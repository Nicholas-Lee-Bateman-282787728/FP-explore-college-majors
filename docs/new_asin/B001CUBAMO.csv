3520247,5,B001CUBAMO,"I knew, albeit vaguely, about the battle off Samar and how seven little warships attacked a vastly superior Japanese fleet.  I was not aware of the many acts of individual heroism that comprised that battle.  The vision of Capt. Evans standing on the fantail of his heavily damaged little destroyer, missing part of his left hand and shouting orders down an open hatchway to men working the rudder by hand is inspiring.  Every school child and especially native American school children should be taught his story.",1337299200,7,514,4.953488372093023
3520248,4,B001CUBAMO,"This was a good effort and I have enjoyed owning it, but I bought this DVD after having seen the presentation on TV....and my MAIN reason for wanting this DVD was that my father served in Taffy 2, on DE 412 Walter C. Wann, which was mentioned in the show.  The Wann, which was shown in graphic detailes in one part of the show, was the last escort in Taffy 2 to make it's turn away from the oncoming Japanese battleships and took fire as they turned.............however, those details were not mention, nor shown in the DVD that I recieved and this is the only reason that I was not totally delighted with my purchase.

3520249,3,B001CUBAMO,"This is a History Channel show about the semi-famous Battle of Leyte Gulf. Called the largest naval engagement in history, the show is specifically about the role played by 'Taffy 3', a group made up of six small escort carriers, three destroyers and four destroyer escorts. This force, with the aid of aircraft from Taffy 1 and 2, went toe to toe with a vastly superior Japanese force of battleships, cruisers and destroyers...and won.

The story itself is a good one and one worth retelling and covered pretty well in 46 minutes. It has some input from some of the survivors and the author of the book by the same name. However, it's obvious that the budget for this show was tight. The graphics are just pictures with fire, for example, superimposed over it to demonstrate a ship getting hit and burning. Pretty low by the standards for THC these days. Episode 8 of season 1 of Dogfights uses 3d graphics and looks much better. As does episode 9 of Battle 360, though that show doesn't devote much time to the Taffy 3 part of the battle.

This disc is made and distributed for THC by some company that makes discs for anybody, hence the plain black box. But it's a good copy and doesn't sport the H bug in the corner, which is nice. There are no extras of course.

You don't really need this show unless you want it for a collection like I did. And it's $25, the standard price for single episodes since the 90s but one I've always concidered too expensive. The show is good enough but for a few bucks more you can get the whole season 1 of Dogfights (11 episodes) or Battle 360 (10 episodes).",1229299200,9,1596,4.440273037542662

8289994,5,B001CUBAMO,"I have not viewed this yet, as I have not been able to find my father's copy of it, though I'm sure it's here in the house somewhere. My father served on the USS Marcus Island CVE, and I found a copy of an email he wrote to The History Channel in 2007, a little over a year before he died, and I thought I would share it with those reading these summaries so that they know there are errors in this particular show, though I'm sure it is spectacular!

Here is what he wrote on 9/14/2007: ""I've just watched the dramatized version of Hornfischer's 'The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors,' for maybe the third time. It is beautiful, but each time I'm frustrated that it claims that the Taffy 3 was the ONLY force guarding MacArthur's Leyte landing force.

""Although in the book Hornfischer gives credit to Taffy 2 and Taffy 3 aircraft, the Dogfights episode doesn't mention us until 35 minutes into the program. Without Taffy 2 and Taffy 1 aircraft, the battle might not have been won.

""I was catapult operator on USS Marcus Island, CVE 77, in Taffy 2, and we launched planes all morning. Our planes claimed several significant hits on Japanese ships, and our deck was a haven for several planes from Taffy 3 that had no other place to go. Undoubtedly, Taffy 1 escort carriers also served in those capacities.

""The program said Taffy 1 was about 30 miles south of Taffy 3, and I suspect my Taffy 2 was about 20 miles, as we did see gun splashes about half a mile abeam of us at one time. We were told our ship was doing 22 knots, about 6 more than it was rated for.

""So Taffy 3, which did put up a very valiant fight and may have saved the rest of us, was not the only group guarding MacArthur's landing. There was also no later mention of the Japanese southern force which tried to come up through the Surigao Strait, but Adm. Oldendorf's old battleships, some of them raised and refitted after Pearl Harbor, quickly defeated that force with the help of PT boats.

""If the southern force had gotten through, everything might have been different. I read Hornfischer's book two years ago. I hope future dramatizations of war stories will be more inclusive about critical facts and not eliminated to enhance the David vs. Goliath theme.""

I found this very interesting to read! So weather the History Channel had made this portion of the show like this purposefully to increase drama, or because they had completely missed the truth in the book, is beyond me. But when it comes to real and true battle scenes in a war, the truth needs to be portrayed, and that truth is just as dramatic as anything that can be doctored up. War is serious business, and my father loved his duty in what he did as a part of that, and he went to his grave with full honors of being a war hero in WWII in Dec. of 2008. I miss him very much!",1385510400,,2819,4.358095238095238
8289995,3,B001CUBAMO,"This is the History Channel's somewhat lame attempt to make a short documentary based on the excellent book by James D. Hornfischer about the Battle of Samar.  The author actually does a lot of the narration and some of the actual participants in the battle are interviewed.  That's the good part.  However, they did this documentary ""on the cheap"" and some of graphics and footage are below par.  For instance, in several scenes they take black and white still pictures of naval guns and add animated explosions and smoke, which looks really cheesy.  Read the book, but don't get the video unless you can find it very inexpensively.",1379203200,4,633,4.824074074074074

I haven't seen this documentary film, but I read the book. That and ""Valor at Samar"" - which is sadly out of print - and ""Sea of Thunder"" tell an astonishing story. The old ""Battlefield"" series of WWII documentaries included an episode on the Battle of Leyte Gulf, and it's worth looking for.

My father was a gunner's mate on the Kalinin Bay, so you can understand my interest in the Leyte Gulf campaign and the Battle of Samar in particular. But it's incomprehensible to me that almost no one has ever even heard of this epic battle. (Ken Burns' much-lauded documentary ""The War"" gives this battle just a cursory mention, which causes me to question his editing skills. Go figure - half the documentary focuses on the reminiscences of some woman who worked in a factory. Burns apparently thought Leyte Gulf and the subsequent fight for the Philippines wasn't as important as her experiences.)

The list of things that make Leyte Gulf hard to overlook is long: largest naval battle - EVER, first time Japanese Navy ""Kamikaze"" Special Forces are deployed, last classic battleship-to-battleship encounter, last chance Japan had of bringing about a turning point in the Pacific War, the Japanese Navy came within a whisker of pulling it off. And then there's the strange-but-true like: an Army general flagged in Navy planes on a captured airfield that Sea Bees re-surfaced after each plane landed, Japanese sailors on the greatest battleship ever built pelted American sailors adrift in the ocean with potatoes.

The only blessing I can think of in this event being largely ignored is that Hollywood hasn't made a movie ""based on true events"" that doesn't let the truth get in the way of what someone thinks is a better story. If this History Channel documentary gives a full and accurate account of the story told in the book, you'll be glad you got it. But read the book, and the others too. It's a story that blows away anything anybody made up. It's really that amazing. And it'll be that bad if and when some Hollywood clown makes it a movie.",1365033600,,2785,5.972431077694235
