2245815,4,B0007VNPEU,"Apollo 12 is the most obscure mission, in that the TV feed was stopped after Alan Bean inadvertently pointed the camera at the sun. This VHS seeks to correct that error by presenting the story of the mission. This includes interviews with all members of the crew, along with other key NASA controllers.
Unfortunately due to the lack of motion picture source, the majority of footage is from other Lunar missions. However, this does not really distract from the overall presentation, as all vision is in context with what is being described.
Overall a very informative documentary well worth the purchase price. My only beef is that it is not available on DVD, and thus the 4/5 rating.",1069804800,,684,4.805084745762712

8052259,2,B0007VNPEU,"Although I a big fan of Pete Conrad and Alan Bean, this is a poor DVD, at best. I would not recommend it to even the most hard core Apollo fan.",1369094400,,143,3.6451612903225805
8052260,3,B0007VNPEU,"Although the production values of this DVD are poor, the material itself contains little riches and facts not generally found elsewhere. For example the send-up video at the end plus anecdotes from the astronauts themselves about the accuracy of the landing, the destruction of the color video camera and Alan Bean's miss-hap on the splash down where he was hit on the head by a 16mm camera that is shaken loose. It is a pity that there is no supporting commentary or captions to let the audience know what missions the surface EVA footage is taken from. With Apollo 12's lunar surface video camera tube ruined by the sun, there was no footage of Conrad and Bean's EVAs at all. So all the EVA footage used in this production is from the later missions. There are a number of other high quality documentaries about the Apollo missions available, including the terrific ""In the Shadow of the Moon"" but this little number can sit on your shelf as a supplement quite well.",1365552000,,968,4.666666666666667
8052261,2,B0007VNPEU,"He or she who made this must be very ashamed. What a piece of !@#$%^

The DVD I received was a home burned one on a Verbatim DVD-R. The title page said the DVD contains a 'Bronze wedding'. Perhaps I would have enjoyed that better. The inlay was printed on a bubblejet printer on A4-sized paper and they used a very low resolution picture.

And don't get me started on video and especially audio. Editing was poor and I was really shocked that someone actually spent some time on audio post-production and during that time never noticed that all his switches were flipped to 'bypass'.

At least the crew was enjoying the shoot. I knew they had a great time during training and the actual flight, but seeing they're still having great fun made me smile.

Save your money and pick another title from this site. If you've seen this one you won't be disapointed.",1249084800,,857,4.509677419354839
8052262,1,B0007VNPEU,"There is a little real Apollo 12, some clips with the real astronauts AND
lots of video of fake ""training.""  This is a minor home movie",1243296000,4,135,4.1923076923076925
8052263,4,B0007VNPEU,"While it is true that the video quality is poor, the run time is short and I want to trim Capt. Conrad's eyebrow so bad it becomes distracting!! The DVD also gave me the feeling that I was watching more of a home movie than a documentary, which I've seen many, many of.  What really makes this ""movie"" worth the price is the back-up crews' hilarious film short at the end of the DVD.  The satirical tape was customarily made to show at the flight party.  It was the back-up crew's job to lighten the mood of the prime crew; though the Apollo 12 crew probably had little need for that since they were best friends. For those who don't know, Pete Conrad is the only astronaut with a multi-colored Christmas tree in his honor at the JSC; all other heroes' memorial trees are white.  After watching this you'll come closer to understanding why Pete believed ""when you can't be good, be colorful!""",1242691200,2,892,4.45398773006135
8052264,1,B0007VNPEU,"Very poor audio and video quality.  Very amateurish.  Problems playing it on my old DVD player.  Much of the content is silly and trivial.  Not what was expected.  I like anything Apollo, but not this.",1219622400,8,201,4.628571428571429
