Film =solid three (3) stars; music = five (5) stars; cinematography/lighting = four (4) stars; subtitles/translations = 3.5 stars.  Director Yoshitar Nomura again displays his fascination with crime mysteries, trains, and rural Japan (in a way, this film looks like a mini Honshu travelogue of many places tourists may never see).  The Director's tale primarily comprises a mash up of:  unrelenting, investigative work by homicide police detectives;  the creation and performance (by a 60-member symphony orchestra) of a piano concerto; and the lingering prejudice against noninfectious leprosy suffers.  Nomura uses a common plot device where seeming remote and unrelated events turn out to be tightly coupled.  The film is too long.  It loses it's dynamic punch when 20-30 minutes of symphonic music is inserted at the end of the film (it's just too much of a good thing and plot-point overkill).  This brings a suspenseful final police evidence review meeting (prior to an arrest warrant being authorized and issued for the concerto's creator/conductor) often to a stand still (there is much cross-cutting between the concert and the stalled review meeting).  A poorly executed contrivance that almost sinks a heretofore well crafted suspense movie! (And far removed from, say, Hitchcock's symphonic suspense scenes in THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH [1934, 1956].)  Acting is fine except for the histrionics of the fake conductor.  Distinguished character actor Chish Ry makes a welcomed cameo (albeit crucial) appearance.  Narrative in the form of on-screen text is surprisingly effective:  it adds value as opposed to being a ""quick and dirty"" way to link disparate scenes during the editing process.  Cinematography/lighting (wide screen, color) are excellent and include striking forward/reverse zoom shots.  Original/adapted music is outstanding.  Subtitles are occasionally a bit too long given their screen duration.  Writings (of which many are shown on screen) are usually not translated.  Same for many newspaper article subheadings.  A cinematic treat.  Highly recommended.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1482105600,,2303,5.543103448275862
8126012,5,B000FS9NZ0,"this is an old Japanese movie of 1974 .  I watched it over 30 years ago.  The quality of the video is still very good ( but not HD quality).
English and Chinese subtitle are available.  Base on the story of writer: Seicho Matsumoto (Japanese: ), this movie tells of the
investigation of a murder case.  The only surprise of this murder case is that the victim was murdered not because of any hatred between him
and the murderer.  How can someone wants to kill his benefactor  ( someone who helped him so much in the past).  The first 70% of the
movie is a mess, and you may become tired of it as it is talking about  the investigation only, but when the movie goes to the remaining 30%, when
the detectives start to review the whole story, the movie dramatically change to a very sensational movie, and at the end,  I think many
who watch it will start to cry.  It is a very good movie for those who love to see difficulties in life, and even has a little sympathy for the murderer.
The audio is in Japanese.  But English and Chinese subtitle are well done, and you can select which one to display too.",1453420800,2,1102,4.25
8126013,5,B000FS9NZ0,"For those who like procedural films, this is a dandy.  Will feel slow to some, but it all leads to a great pay off.",1443398400,,115,3.7916666666666665
8126014,1,B000FS9NZ0,"A sugary melodrama with the most unrealistic naive plot where even the suspense line cannot be held intact as the involvement of the evil genius composer becomes clear after his second ""accidental"" appearance in the movie.  The most laughable part is when a sensitive police detective runs a little presentation of the life story of the suspect and bursts into tears. Probably watched the Castle of Sand before that. ))) And it is accompanied by about 30 minutes of inserts of a performance of some mediocre musical piece.",1409097600,,522,4.931818181818182
8126015,5,B000FS9NZ0,"I've probably watched this movie 5 or 6 times.  It's a great detective story, a good example of plodding, methodical investigative work, and some of the best acting I've seen in a Japanese film.  There are some deeply moving scenes and the whole film is an excellent account of life in Japanese small towns and villages in the 1970s.  I highly recommend this film and especially Americans who are curious about Japanese culture.  The quality of the DVD I have is only adequate - about television quality -- but the story more than makes up for that.",1348531200,2,549,4.628865979381444
8126016,3,B000FS9NZ0,"The Movie is very good, even though sometimes you may feel stuffed for the last 40 minutes with endless flow of heavy music (Destiny). Still it does a great job as a touching human tale. (The acting is simply superb) The reason I cannot give this product more stars is the subtitle. This DVD comes with two subtitles (Chinese and English), which are usually OK, but in some part, there is no subtitle in any language for 3 or 4 lines. It happens two or three times throughout the movie. (So, it is not too bad and no problem in catching up with the story) Other than that, no complain for the transfer, and very recommendable movie. So, if you have no other way to see this movie, this is the best option and I recommend it. But, sincerely hope somebody make a better version of DVD of these excellent Nomura classics as they did for Zero Focus & Demon.",1329955200,4,853,4.3375
8126017,5,B000FS9NZ0,"This movie is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I'll tell you. Watch this, You'll never forget this film. Especially, you cannot watch the last part without tears.

This DVD seems to be from Hong Kong, so English subtitle is not so good; however, you'll be moved. If you can understand Japanese, buy the Japanese version. They have degital remaster version, which looks really beautiful and sound effects are much better than this.

The story is basically about 2 detectives' crime investigation relating to the murder of retired police officer, Kenichi Miki.

The plot seems to be suspense, but as you'll see later, it'll be totally different.

Why did this kind police officer have to be killed? 2 detectives cannot find any answers.

This movie is based on one of the best seller novels in Japan.

The truth will be told with a symphony ""Destiny"" in last 40 minutes.

You cannot watch without a handkerchief.

Awards: [...]

Believe me. It's worth to see this.",1177545600,15,968,4.783132530120482
