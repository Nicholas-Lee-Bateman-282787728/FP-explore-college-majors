5055209,5,B0074V781M,"First, let me say that not every film in this five film set is a five star movie.  Secondly, let me add that not every film here I would remotely consider Film Noir.  But with those two things out of the way, TCM with Columbia pictures have put out a solid set of films that are 'classics' in their own right and would probably be passed over or forgotten if not by their hard work on bringing these films to new audiences.

'My Name Is Julia Ross' (1945) is one of those movies that is remembered by anyone who has ever seen it.  Not quite a Noir, but a decent enough B-picture mystery that is enjoyable for such a small budget.

'The Mob' (1951)  has the great Broderick Crawford rattling off his snappy one-liners like a machine gun against the likes of Ernest Borgnine.  Another solid B-picture that is more Cops and Robbers than Noir (but love those black and white rain scenes in the beginning!)

The final three: 'Drive A Crooked Road', 'Tight Spot' and 'The Burglar' are the best three in the bunch, with 'Drive' and 'Burglar' being the real deal Noirs.

Picture quality and sound are very good on all films, and even Martin Scorsese introduces two of these.  I can see how this might be price prohibitive, but if you can catch this at a good deal then by all means do.",1421539200,29,1277,4.372881355932203
5055210,5,B0074V781M,"I love Noir films.  There are some gems here, particularly Julia Ross, Drive a Crooked Road and Burglar.  Tight Spot is also very good.  The Mob was not bad.  I had to pay quite a bit for the set due to the set being generally unavailable or out of print (?).  If you can get it reasonably priced I would highly recommend it, but it is not worth paying an arm and a leg, which might be required due to lack of availability.",1411948800,5,423,4.048192771084337
5055211,5,B0074V781M,"As always, Columbia scores big with these collections. Wonderful print quality and some valuable extras. Of this group of films, THE MOB and DRIVE A CROOKED ROAD are especially memorable. But, honestly, I enjoyed seeing them all. If you love Noir, this is a must have for your collection. (As, of course, are Classics I and II.)",1369872000,5,328,4.771929824561403
5055212,5,B0074V781M,Best films in Vol. 3 are MY NAME IS JULIA ROSS with Nina Foch and THE BURGLAR with Dan Duryea and Jayne Mansfield! Surprise role for her! Buy the whole series!,1367107200,3,159,4.161290322580645
5055213,5,B0074V781M,"As I don't wish to add anything to the excellent five starred review from Michael Stodgehill as he has pretty much covered everything and in great detail for which I am grateful.

I am however going to severely contradict the 'reviews' by Benny Quincy Shaft and Thomas L Boggio and state the following :

All five movies are presented correctly in their original aspect ratios as a cursory glance around the internet will confirm. Lets take them in order just to re-affirm this.

My Name Is Julia Ross is 1:33:1 Original Aspect Ratio with a run time of 1:04:56

The Mob is 1:33:1 Original Aspect Ratio with a run time of 1:26:06

Drive A Crooked Road is presented in 1:85 at 16x9 enhanced (anamorphic) and that is its OAR with a run time of 1:22:42

Tight Spot is presented in 1:78:1 at 16x9 enhanced (anamorphic) again its OAR with a run time of 1:36:03

The Burglar is presented in 1:85 at 16x9 enhanced (anamorphic) as its the OAR with a run time of 1:30:15

In other words no 'Butchering' or cutting has been carried out on any of the Films at all least of all the ones that were highlighted. I hope that people can now go on and order these beautifully presented classics worry free now.",1342051200,44,1192,4.460829493087558
5055214,5,B0074V781M,"Having purchased the first two volumes of the COLUMBIA FILM NOIR SERIES in 2009 and 2010, I had been hoping that another volume would be released. But when 2011 came and went I had pretty much given up hope of seeing anymore titles from the Columbia vaults. Imagine my surprise and delight when I found out about Volume III a few weeks ago. I immediately ordered it and just finished watching the fifth and final film of the series last night. I love film noir films ever since I saw ""LAURA"" and ""DOUBLE INDEMNITY""(both from 1944) years ago. Over the years, Warners Home Video, Universal, 20th Century-Fox and Columbia have each issued Box Sets and individual titles on home video. Although the flow of these releases as slowed, I'm happy that Columbia is still going through it's vaults and getting them out. For this third volume in their Film Noir Series they've partnered with TCM(probably for financial reasons) and other than a ten-second TCM logo at the beginning of each feature, nearly everything is the same as with the first two volumes once the SONY logo starts. That being said, the five new films cover the years 1945(MY NAME IS JULIA ROSS) TO 1957(THE BURGLAR). There are new stars too. In the first two volumes, Columbia contract players Glenn Ford, Gloria Grahame, Kim Novak, Vince Edwards and Brian Keith showed up in at least one film in Volumes One and Two. Only Brian Keith makes a third appearance in the excellent ""TIGHT SPOT"" along with it's director, Phil Karlson, who also makes a third director appearance with this new volume. Like the first two volumes, all five films have been restored and remastered and they're great to look at, especially ""THE MOB""(1951) and ""TIGHT SPOT""(1955). ""THE MOB"" features Broderick Crawford in one of his finest roles as a police detective who goes undercover to break up gangsters who have infiltrated the Longshoreman's Union. The supporting cast features Ernest Borgnine, Richard Kiley, Neville Brand and an uncredited and very young Charles Bronson(seen early in the film as a longshoreman). Compare Crawford's performance in this with his excellent performance in ""HUMAN DESIRE"" from Volume two and you'll see why he was underrated as an actor. Most people only know him from the 1950's TV show ""Highway Patrol"" but he did win an Oscar for ""ALL THE KING'S MEN"" in 1949. ""TIGHT SPOT"" features not only Brian Keith, but Edward G. Robinson, Ginger Rogers and Lorne Greene(as a vicious gangster kingpin). Personally, I think Ginger Rogers was miscast and the part should have been played by Gloria Grahame(one of my favorites). That being said, the picture moves along at a fast pace thanks in part to Phil Karlson's direction. The oldest film in this new volume is ""MY NAME IS JULIA ROSS"" which was released in 1945. It takes place in England and looks like it was filmed there. But after viewing the special features to the film it was filmed entirely on the Columbia back lot. It seems like a long movie but in reality is only 64 mins long! This is in no part to the great direction by Joseph H. Lewis. Nina Foch(""The Ten Commandments"",""Spartacus"" and more recently the TV series ""NCIS"") gives an excellent performance in one of her first Columbia film noir pictures. Hopfully we'll see her again if SONY decides to issue a Volume Four in this series next year. ""DRIVE A CROOKED ROAD""(1954) is probably a strange choice for this series but is well directed by Richard Quine whose ""PUSHOVER"" was included in Volume Two. It features an adult Mickey Rooney in a very touching performance. Kevin McCartey, Jack Kelly, and Dianne Foster round out the cast. ""THE BURGLAR"" has film noir written all over it not only in the writing but the atmosphere as well. Martin Scorese introduces the picture which was notable for the appearance of rising sex symbol Jayne Mansfield. She actually gives a very good accounting of herself in the acting department which will surprise many who watch the film. Those are the five new films for this excellent third addition to the Columbia Film Noir Series. Five stars again for this latest box set from SONY.",1339718400,42,4100,4.817021276595745
5055215,1,B0074V781M,"Warning: TCM butchered 3 of the 5 movies.

TCM chopped off the top and the bottom of the original Full Screen Image to reduce it from 1:33 (Full Screen) down to 1:85 (Widescreen).

Drive a Crooked Road (1954)

8510227,5,B0074V781M,These are some of the coolest movies.  If you like films from the 40ties and 50ties you will like these movies.  The actors really had to make you believe the story.  They spoke clearly and loud enough for us to hear them.  No mush mouth or leaving us guessing at the plot.  These are some of the best movies ever make in my opinion and they did it with out blowing up a bunch of stuff.  It is no wonder that people went to the movies.
