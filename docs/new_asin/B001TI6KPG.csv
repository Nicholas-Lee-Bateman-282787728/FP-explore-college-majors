8341510,1,B001TI6KPG,i have never ordered anything bad from amazon until now.  i shipped this to my daughter as a gift and when it was received ALL the food items were outdated.  and outdated by a lot.  Some of the food items and diet supplements expired in 2009 and 2010.  An embarrassment to me!  Please don't order this!,1364601600,,302,4.321428571428571
