8640645,5,B00IBKXTOA,"We've watched all except the Sinatra flick and each one has been excellent.  You may not have heard of all of these, but for lovers of noir, I can't imagine a better set of movies.",1493337600,5,180,4.142857142857143

8640649,3,B00IBKXTOA,"I ,ay have ordered the wrong version.  It's subtitled but only in Spanish.  Not good if you don't speak Spanish.",1412380800,10,112,4.55
8640650,3,B00IBKXTOA,"As the Film Chest suggests, these are from 35mm prints. Restored? I don't think so. Best image quality of the bunch is SUDDENLY. No complaints on that one, but the others all have a milky quality and are hot. Sometimes the faces look like ghosts. Both THE STRANGER and KANSAS CITY CONFIDENTIAL have been released by MGM and those are just fine. MARTHA IVERS was also professionally released, by Paramount I think, and although I haven't seen that one it's probably much better than you'll find here. All and all save your money.",1409961600,53,528,4.688172043010753
