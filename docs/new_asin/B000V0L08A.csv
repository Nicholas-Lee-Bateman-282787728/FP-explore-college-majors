2928152,5,B000V0L08A,"If you like old school Texas swing reminesent of Bob Wills, you must get this cd or better yet - the DVD. We saw these folks on Grand ole Opry. They are a goup of musicians who have been playing/singing with many of the nashville 'Elite'for many years and started getting together at a local Nashville 'honky tonk' and Monday nights to jam. We got the DVD for ourselves and the cd for my husbands father. My father in law has played fiddle most all his life and he was bowled over by these guys.  We ended up giving him the DVD also so he could show it to his friends and fellow musicians. The Time Jumpers are a musicians cup of tea because these guys are flawless. We will be getting another DVD for ourselves and keep it mind as a gift for others.",1215993600,,750,4.172413793103448
2928153,5,B000V0L08A,This a great  bunch the music.  The artist on the CD are the greatest we play the CD all the time.,1215648000,,98,3.619047619047619
2928154,5,B000V0L08A,"Where do Nashville musicians, singers and song writers go for entertainment when they have a night off? They go to The Station Inn to see and hear the Time Jumpers play these incredible musical arrangements! In addition to the music, this DVD includes interviews with some of the artists in the audience, as well as interviews with the Time Jumpers themselves.

The Time Jumpers represent modern western swing at its very best. I doubt that you will find any band anywhere that has as many highly skilled musicians in it as this one. These artists command top dollar as ""call"" musicians in the recording studios of Nashville, and they spend their days cranking out the kind of music that the recording company execs think will sell, but on Monday nights they gather at The Station Inn to play music that is fun to play--and fun to listen to! These musicians are capable of playing any type of music from Beethoven to Bach to Bob Wills, but when they get together to let their hair down and have fun they turn to western swing, with a few cowboy and traditional country songs added for variety.

This is not a touring band, and the musicians don't have that ""burned out"" look that you see on the faces of road musicians who play the same songs night after night. In fact, they stand up there grinning like Chessie cats for the entire two-hour concert on this DVD, clearly enjoying every minute of it. There is one exception: when Dawn Sears launches into ""Sweet Memories"" the smiles disappear as the band members begin to get pulled in by Dawn's beautiful, emotional rendition of the song. At the end, they are all struggling to hold back their tears--as you will be when you hear and see her great performance. The other female vocalist, Carolyn Martin, is also outstanding on her songs. If this were a rational world, both of these beautiful ladies would have several million-selling records on the market.

I won't take up more space reviewing each of the cuts on this DVD. They are all outstanding examples of musicianship. I feel so strongly about the quality of this DVD that I have bought three copies to give to friends, and will buy more. You need to try this one. You will then be anxiously awaiting the Time Jumpers' next release.",1215388800,6,2240,4.63727959697733
2928155,5,B000V0L08A,I ordered this after watching a clip on Youtube & was definitely not disappointed. It's quite difficult to find good CD's & DVD's of Country/Western Swing in Australia so finding this was great. The best brirthday present I've had in years!!!! A definite must for fans of great Fiddle & Pedal Steel playing.,1213660800,,307,4.811320754716981
2928156,5,B000V0L08A,One of the best I've heard in a long time. Each song done with so much feeling and they were having fun doing it.,1209427200,,113,3.75
2928157,5,B000V0L08A,"The Time Jumpers is probably the greatest music DVD I've ever heard. 11 players, and not a ringer in the bunch. Every song is a treat. I missed a chance to see The Time Jumpers while in Nashville. It was a well kept  secret! Unfortunately, I didn't find out about them until reading of John Hughey's passing. They will have a hard time finding a player to take his spot. He can never really be replaced. At least I have 2 hours and 26 songs to enjoy. If you like Western Swing, you'll never regret buying it.",1198195200,3,508,4.237113402061856
2928158,5,B000V0L08A,Nashville sessions musicians jam to perfection.  Great western swing music. Outstanding vocals by all.  You will watch this again and again.,1191196800,6,140,5.619047619047619

2928169,5,B000V0L08A,"I loved every minute of  it. I had been trying to buy same in the record shops here in Perth, but no one had it & some had never heard of it.  I only heard of it myself when whilst listening to the Radio one afternoon & they played a Dawn Sears song that I liked so that's when I began searching, & eventually got onto the Time Jumpers.",1376697600,,336,3.8550724637681157
2928170,5,B000V0L08A,"OK, these folks are primarily studio and backup guys and gals, but these musicians are Nashville Royalty and their music is top notch.  Ain't no millionaires on stage here, but you'll never hear better music.  Buy it.  You won't regret it!",1372118400,,239,4.780487804878049
2928171,5,B000V0L08A,"Listening to the cd is one thing, but watching the dvd is one hundred times better. They are all great musicians and talented singers. The only thing missing was Vince Gill as part of the performance. It was still fun to listen to and watch. A nice addition to my collection.",1371254400,,275,4.411764705882353

2928174,5,B000V0L08A,"Saw these guys live at a local bar in Nashville, couldn't believe I was sitting less than 10 feet away from Vince Gill. What an amazing guitarist. The other musicians totally blew me away at how goode they all are. Have seen many of them perform at the Opry with other bands too!",1356307200,,279,4.283018867924528
2928175,5,B000V0L08A,"This group is awesome-buy it and you will not regret it! They play American music from their hearts and obviously love doing it.
audio and video quality is very good. Papa John Hughey(steel guitar) is terrific!",1355443200,,210,4.861111111111111

2928177,5,B000V0L08A,"Saw the Time Jumpers first show at their new location at 3rd & Lindsley Bar and Grill on June 11th.  Vince Gill is now a member of the band and sang 4 songs with each of the musicians doing their solos.  What a band and musicians.  All excellent and great entertainment.  The cost was only $15 and the food is very good and inexpensive. A show not to be missed. Only on Monday nights.  Doors open at 7pm, show starts at 9pm and goes non stop for 2+ hours.",1340064000,,455,4.067415730337078
2928178,5,B000V0L08A,"This DVD was everything I expected and more.
Awesome instrumental's
Dawn is sooooo good. She def. has a God given gift for her awesome voice",1337558400,,140,4.64
2928179,5,B000V0L08A,"As a professional musician I have to admit that I was never much a fan of Country Music, but this is a huge exception!  I first saw this on PBS and was so amazed at the tremendous quality and absolute professionalism of these musicians, that I couldn't get this presentation out of my mind.  To say that the Time Jumpers is a superb listening experience is to do it an injustice.  Everyone involved with the group is a stand-alone first-rate musician, and when you put that many people in one room, the sky is the limit.  Never in my life have I heard any slide guitar player demonstrate absolute perfection as ""Papa John"" Hughey, who died about two years after this show, and just to hear his collaboration with the other musicians is only one example of an exciting live performance that you will never forget.  If anyone were to ask me if I had a favorite number on this fantastic DVD, I would be VERY hard pressed to come up with an answer - it's like asking someone which bite of their birthday cake tasted the best!  There simply is no piece in this entire two hour show that I can find fault with.

  This is truly Country Music in a country swing format at its very best.  I'm happy to be able to say that you will NOT be disappointed!!",1334188800,3,1244,4.323275862068965
2928180,5,B000V0L08A,Was told about this by a fellow steel player and though I'd heard John Hughey play I had no idea just how good he was on the C6th neck.  I'm not at all interested in playing on C6th but this is just mind blowing!!,1330992000,,213,3.840909090909091
2928181,5,B000V0L08A,"If you love country music then this is a MUST have video.  Our friend John Hughey is the steel guitar player and in the International Steel Guitar Hall of Fame (my husband is in there too) and he played with Conway Twitty, Vince Gill, and many, many others. The band really is awesome and the singers can't be beat.  Although we lost John a couple of years ago this is a wonderful memory!  You will Love this DVD!!!",1280534400,,415,4.294871794871795
2928182,5,B000V0L08A,This was a gift for my husband and he loved it.  The product arrived as advertised.  This was a group we originally saw on PBS.,1265328000,,127,4.04
2928183,5,B000V0L08A,Top musicians playing top tunes. A treat to the ears. Great vocals and musicians who are so laid back but at the top of their game. A must for any collection.,1258761600,,158,4.129032258064516
2928184,5,B000V0L08A,This is a great dvd with good old country music. Stuff you would hear at the Grand Ole Opry. This is what real country music sounds like and each one of the people in the band really interact well with each other and enjoy what the other one is doing. I am hoping they will put out another album!! Well worth the money and you feel like you are part of the audience! If you can't go to Nashville and listen to them live then buy this dvd. Not only is there great music on this dvd there are interviews with each artist. It took us several hours to watch the whole thing.,1258156800,,570,4.053097345132743
2928185,5,B000V0L08A,"This group is just phenomenal... do yourself a favor and get the video as well as the CD.  Watching them is more than double the pleasure.  They so obviously love playing this wonderful music and each member gives 100% support to make all the others look and sound fantastic.  It's a great pleasure to see such unselfish, genuine love of playing just for the pure joy of it!  Absolutely loved it!!",1250121600,,397,4.549295774647887
2928186,5,B000V0L08A,I bought the CD and then had to buy the DVD.  If it gets any better than this my heart won't stand it.  This group is about as tight as it gets.  Good professional musicians at the top of their game.  Buy it and you'll watch and listen over and over and over.  Good Stuff!!!  I hope it sells by the trainload and they do it again!!,1249171200,,331,3.8656716417910446
2928187,5,B000V0L08A,"What a group of talented musicians!  Their music is controlled, tight and with great sound.  It's our favorite DVD and we watch it often.  We can't wait for them to produce their next DVD!",1246060800,,188,4.470588235294118
2928188,5,B000V0L08A,In 2004 I went to the Station Inn to listen to this band upon a recommendation from my friend Jimmy C. Newman whose fiddler played in the band. I am so glad that this DVD was realized and I will treasure it very much. If you like this kind of country music it's among the best.,1224806400,,277,3.9642857142857144

8216134,5,B000V0L08A,"Although an old taping, this is a favorite in our home.  Own both the DVD and the CD.  In today's world, would miss seeing the ladies perform, as it appears the current performers  are all gentlemen.  And, of course, the loss of Dawn Sears would be an unfillable roll.",1469059200,,268,4.408163265306122
