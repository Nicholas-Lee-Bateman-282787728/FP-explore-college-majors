7914200,1,B00000K338,"this is a poorly put together vol. 1.  i have played vol. 1 at least 20 times and this is not it.  the vol. 1 i know starts out w/ the wonderful music and anna madrigal watering her plants on the patio first thing in the morning.  i feel dupped in rec'g this version.  i don't recognize most of it and dislike it intensly.

i feel so upset i'd like my money back.  i think you're selling this dishonestly.",1359504000,,405,4.063291139240507
