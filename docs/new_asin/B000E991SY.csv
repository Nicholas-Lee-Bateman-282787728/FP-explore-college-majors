2510367,4,B000E991SY,"If you love Doris Day, as I do, you'll love this DVD (No one's buying it to see Perry Como, I'm sure).  But truly, this CBS special is a mess if not an outright train wreck.  Doris is game and cheerful amid it all so it's easy to overlook the sloppy editing, tacky set and sleep-inducing guest star.  Conceptually (if there was a concept at all) it cannot compare to the slicker TV specials and variety shows that the networks produced later in the decade for Cher or Mary Tyler Moore.  This special epitomizes that late-Sixties/early-Seventies period when big band-era (or style) singers like Doris, Perry Como, Peggy Lee, Frank Sinatra, Steve & Eydie, etc., were struggling to stay contemporary by recording Joni Mitchell and Beatles songs.  They always got the melody right, of course, but something is so very, very wrong with those Percy Faith-style arrangements. In this special, Doris grooves to ""Both Sides Now"" and ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"" while sporting mini skirts, knee socks, crocheted poor boy caps and 3-pound false eyelashes.  As a circa 1970 fashion show, this special can't be beat but poor Doris is just a little long in the tooth for these mod looks, obviously dreamed up for Twiggy.  Still, despite its flaws, it's great watching Doris do her thing.  Many of the songs were clearly recorded live, and that's a treat.  The  production numbers are synched -- badly.  The outtakes included with the DVD are fun.  (Doris seems pretty lusty for Perry in the scenes they share and she lights up for the 15 seconds Rock Hudson's on screen.)  Make sure you check out the Rock Hudson outtake featuring Doris's most outrageously bad hairdo EVER -- not suprisingly missing from the aired show.  In closing, if you're a Doris fan, you can't not buy this DVD.  But it ain't art...or even ""Jumbo.""",1150675200,3,1800,4.798701298701299
2510368,4,B000E991SY,"Think about it: there is a LOT of records & movies from Ms Day out there. Thanks to the fine efforts of MPI Home Video, we finally have the chance to see again up to 3 seasons of the Day Show, but except for these marvelous items, not much visual stuff. (MPI adds some What's My Line episodes with her, and that is treasurable).

My only regret is to see her paired with the pretty dull-faced and bland Como. Near her sparkling smile and sound voice, he is easily forgotten... He always sings like he doesn't want to put his heart in it. I could have lived without him... But, with whom to pair her otherwise? Gordon Macrae wasn't at his best then, Dean Martin would have overacted...

This special is almost a course in 1971 fashion too. But not much is still "" la mode"" today, and it makes us smile to see the always perfectly groomed Day be so happy about them! However, with the last songs, she wears a white and silver embroided outfit that matches her beauty and marvelous voice.

I wish this special was on CD...

Any fan of Day should get this special Special, out there at a very affordable price too!

(Sigh!). We want more...",1150588800,2,1136,4.339622641509434
2510369,5,B000E991SY,"Doris Day made only two TV music specials and this one, which aired in 1971, was wonderful because it focused almost entirely on her singing -- both alone and with guest Perry Como. (There is a brief comedy bit reuniting Doris with her motion picture partner Rock Hudson.) Doris' voice was as warm and beautiful as ever singing some of her all-time classics like ""It's Magic"" and ""Sentimental Journey"" as well as more contemporary material like the stunning ""Both Sides Now"" and the playful ""Feelin' Groovy."" The show looks great -- rich colors and clear picture plus the DVD producers have supplied an hour of extra footage -- including many of the show's songs remixed to stereo and without studio laugh track -- plus behind-the-scenes glimpses of Doris and Perry between takes, a deleted Doris dance number, outtakes with Doris and an insightful interview with one of the special's producer. This is a treasure trove for anyone who admirers a great vocalist like Doris doing what comes naturally -- and it's an incredible bargain too. Doris Day is truly one of the most underrated of female singers. She is a delight and a totally natural talent.",1145145600,20,1149,4.86734693877551
2510370,5,B000E991SY,"No one..NO ONE can match this woman's talent.  Watching her ""do"" anything is facinating.  Listening to her sing is a mesmerizing experience and NO ONE can formulate or say anthing like she does.  It's just genious at work.  I know she doesn't understand it, it's second nature to her, but to us, it's sheer genious.  She opens her mouth and there is that awesome voice......

She decided to not sing anymore for whatever reason no one really knows (her voice was super!) and she walked away from films and TV at the top.  Those decisons were our loss, but at least we have these awesome pieces of genious to see and hear.

Doris Day's late son, Terry Melcher, said that ""When she decided she was one inch past her prime, she was gone.  Well, he also said that Doris' voice never sounded better, and that was in the late 80's!  If Terry couldn't get her to record, I guess no one could.  (remember he produced tons of gr8 recordings and acts, such as the Byrds, Paul Revere and the Raiders, etc.  He also revived many of the old guard singers and produced new sounds for them, giving them their last huge hits on the airwaves.  Those people include, Patti Page, Frankie Laine, Wayne Newton, to name a few.)

In 1985-1986 she made a pet care series out of Carmel, her home town now, called ""Doris Day's Best Friends"".  It was on CBN.  This is the series in which Rock Hudson appeared and was well advanced with HIV much to Doris' shock.  He told her ""I've got the flu and I just cannot shake it"".  But he promised Doris he would do the show first thing, and he did it.  The last appearance he did in his life.  Doris was really shook by his lack of health and appearance.  She told him to move into one of her cottages on her property and she'd force feed him if she had to in order to put weight on him.  In the series which only lasted one season, Doris sang up a storm, recorded like crazy under Terry's direction and those songs are stuffed away somewhere as is the series.  Hopefully, it will be released for us to enjoy sometime soon as well.  Really unique and fun songs from this series.  Some written by Terry!  One called ""My Heart"" is stunning, for example.  Singing the title theme to her films is a Doris Day trademark, and this series is no exception with a fun hyped up tune, ""Animals Are My Best Friends"".  Gr8 fun!!

This will be the best 10 bucks you will ever spend!  Thank God for sending us such a fine person and for allowing us to enjoy these intimate moments with her voice and presence.

Doris Day ROCKS!  And I wish we could clone her.  Can you blame me?

2510371,5,B000E991SY,"CBS had the perfect remedy for chasing away the late winter blues when, in 1971, they presented two hours of great musical entertainment one Sunday evening.

Composer Burt Bacharach starred in a major special with guest star Barbra Streisand and it was enjoyed by millions.  However, it was the second CBS Special of the evening that truly reminded viewers what the word Special meant when applied to musical entertainment. That's when Doris Day, then starring in the third season of her smash hit comedy series for the Tiffany Network, dusted off her vocal chords and dancing shoes and refreshed viewers as to why she was a legend in the musical department.

""The Doris Mary Anne Kappelhoff Special"" was a musical dream hour that allowed the gifted lady ample opportunity to sing, dance and charm with all the natural gifts that she alone possessed.

Filmed in a lush garden setting, based upon Miss Day's own backyard in Beverly Hills, there wasn't an instant in which the audience, judging by the staggering ratings, was not totally won over.

Miss Day began her musical journey on a bicycle, then her favorite mode of transport for getting around Beverly Hills. A medley including her mega-hit ""Secret Love"", ""Who Will Buy"" from ""Oliver"", a bit of the Beatles and some Simon and Garfunkel, made for a captivating opening and it only got better.

""Hurry It's Lovely Up Here"" from Streisand's then recent film, ""On a Clear Day"" was given new life by Doris Day's sparkling rendering. She introduces her dogs, sings to them and somehow manages to make it absolutely disarming.

During the breakneck hour, she models a score of fashions, sings and dances to ""Gypsy in My Soul"" and as a flapper to a Roger Miller tune.

Special guest star Perry Como scores a knockout and his chemistry with Miss Day is top-notch.  They make beautiful music together while engaging in playful banter. ""When You Were Sweet Sixteen"", ""Let Me Call You Sweetheart"" and ""If I Had My Life to Live Over"" are only a few of their songs.  They have some great fun built around Miss Day's hit recording of ""Everybody Loves a Lover"" and you'll hit a bit of ""Summertime"" by Gershwin, ""In the Summertime"" by Roger Miller and a couple of Latin American love songs sung to perfection by the delightufl duo.

A series of film clips from classic Day films leads to a delightful cameo appearance by frequent film co-star Rock Hudson but the best is saved for last. Miss Day ties it all together brilliantly with a classic rendering of the Judy Collins hit, ""Both Sides Now"" followed by flawless performances of two of her greatest hits - ""It's Magic"" and ""Sentimental Journey"".

Promised on the DVD, being released under the title, ""The Doris Day Special"" are an hour of extras including alternate takes, bloopers and commentary but the main reason to purchase this DVD is to see Doris Day in a rare musical foray.

Tens of millions tuned in to watch in 1971 and now, 35 years later, everyone has the opportunity to see what all the fuss was about. If you're not a fan, you are guaranteed to be after spending two hours with Doris Day and her vocal chords of gold.",1138665600,77,3126,4.713761467889908

It good to see her teamed with another sometimes forgotton performer, Perry Como....thay make an attractive couple, and the pity is that Doris did not do more Musical Spectaculars for television.

What a disappointment.

I find it hard to believe that even Doris Day fans (and I'm one) would look back on this show and be so glowing about it. ""Trite"" isn't the word for it: phony/stagy is more like it.

Day did not appear to be enjoying herself throughout this show. One too many rehearsals, perhaps, wore her down. Her lines, her behavior, her responses to Como and Hudson were patently staged and not heart-felt.

And to see this 40-something woman dressing up like Little Orphan Annie was flat out worthy of sneering. I'm sorry, folks, but ""older"" women did not dress like that in 1970s. High-schoolers, yes. 40-something women, NO.

One redeeming quality about this now out-of-print DVD is the alternate takes. Skip the broadcast show, and go directly to the alternate version.

The only thing I agree with regarding the other reviewers here is that she did a superb job with ""Lovely Up Here"", but only in the alternate, stereo take. The broadcast version was hacked to heck.

Doris and Perry Como's duet together was ok (but Perry seemed to not like Doris flirting with him.) Doris Day has always been under-rated as a singer. Her voice is sheer perfection.

If you're a Doris Day fan you will absolutely love it and even if you're not you will soon appreciate the huge talent this lady has in all areas of entertainment.  I loved the last 2 songs 'It's Magic' and especially the very lovely jazzed up version of 'Sentimental Journey' which was absolutely brilliant.  Miss Day was a vision in a white trouser suit with silver trim and looked and sounded like a million dollars.  What a voice! What a woman!

I also liked the guest star Perry Como singing duet with Doris and even though he seemed to be a bit shy as Doris was looking romantically at him while singing the incredibly beautiful 'Quiet Nights for Quiet Stars' they blended very well together.  Doris is obviously a very exuberant and affectionate woman and a wonderful actress and I think Perry couldn't quite keep up with her in all those departments.  However, in the outtakes he nearly makes up for it and was quite funny.

I also loved the dance scenes 'Good Old Days', and 'Its the Gypsy in My Soul'.  The scenes with her dogs was lovely and very natural.  The Rock Hudson cameo was quite funny but a bit short, it's a pity he didn't get to speak a bit more but he sure made a hit with the sexy kiss he gave Doris.  Doris is also a very good raconter and I enjoyed her little story about the TV sets and how she got her name changed from Kapplehoff to Day.

All in all this DVD is an absolute MUST.  It is very reasonably priced and will be a prized possession in anyone's DVD collection.",1151712000,11,1528,4.319298245614035

The teaming of Doris with Perry Como was pure magic as their voices blended beautifully. I loved her singing with her dogs, it was quite moving and funny ( I sing to my cats!), this was a case of not being outshined by the animals. When she sang ""It`s Magic"" it sent shivers down my spine, something that no other singer has ever been able to do. What a talented lady, if you don`t love Doris you either are not young at heart or you don`t appreciate the strength of her musical talent.

There aren't many entertainers you can say this about. She has charmed millions of people, for decades too. She is truly an American treasure and she shows why in this lavish musical special. Doris can do it all from singing to dancing to playing comedy or drama. In this special, we get to hear her velvety singing voice, singing some of her biggest hits. The teaming of Doris and Perry Como, was geniuous at work. They blend beautifully together and there was a lot of chemistry between the two of them. Doris has never looked more beautiful. Her personality shines through as she pokes fun at all of her crying scenes, in her films over the years. Her sweet and adorable segment with her dogs is also wonderful to see. The outtakes are fun to watch too. I highly recommend this for all of you Doris Day fans. As for what some said on here about blurry pictures and quality. They must have been watching a different dvd as I saw nothing wrong with the quality of this dvd. This is a rare treat for the eye and ear, of all of you Doris' fans. If you are new to her work and watch this for the first time, I guarantee you will become an instant Doris Day fan.

The ever-relaxed Perry Como was an appropriate guest star, and Rock Hudson provides a very funny cameo. But it is Doris's show, and this program uses all her talents brilliantly. Most people don't remember that she was not only the biggest female star in Hollywood throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, but one of the most popular recording stars of her generation.

We get to hear many of her signature tunes (""It's Magic,"" ""Sentimental Journey,"" ""Everybody Loves a Lover"" et al) sung as only Doris could (and her voice was still in its prime), share in her incredible love for animals (a great sequence with her many beloved dogs), see her dance and prance and model the many mod fashions of the day, and watch a number of her many crying scenes from the movies.

The outtakes are terrific too; a major highlight is a lovely waltz by Doris and the male dancers (if you know her history, you know she was a professional dancer who was in a terrible car accident as a teenager, when the car was hit by a train, which ended her dance career, and she became a singer, and here she is still dancing gracefully at 47!)But what is most surprising is her storytelling capabilities; her sense of humor is natural and engaging, and her patter (the outtake about how she got to Hollywood is hysterical) is terrific.

Do I love Doris? You bet, and so will you, whether it's for the first time or as an amazing rediscovery.",1150848000,4,1627,4.6

8107569,1,B000E991SY,"I tried to watch this show.  I use the term show very loosely.  First sit there and watch Mrs. Day ride around on a bicycle for about 10-15 minutes.  Next, enjoy a flash back moment to that time you sat down with your crazy neighbor lady.  As Doris Day introduces you to her dogs, telling you all about them, how much she loves them, and sit uncomfortably as she loves on them.  Following that is a seriously interesting banter between Doris and a gentleman she had invited to sing on the show as they recall the conversation they had on what he was to wear.
Be dazzled as Doris Day shares photos of herself in her favorite outfits... that was only the first half... I couldn't bear to watch any more.
Mrs. Day is a wonderful actress and will always be remembered for her iconic roles. But if you wish to preserve those wonderful memories, do not watch this special.",1435449600,2,866,4.3875
8107570,5,B000E991SY,Doris is joined by Perry Como and there is a special appearance by Rock Hudson.  You can easily see that Doris and Perry are great friends and they both sound fantastic.  The production appears to have been very high as the set was absolutely beautiful.  As the show moves along it is evident Doris is having a great time with this special.  If you are a Doris fan you should add this to you DVD collection.,1434412800,,407,4.315789473684211
