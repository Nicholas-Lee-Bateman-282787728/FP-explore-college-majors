8210927,5,B000F6ZBNA,"Director Oliver Stone is a master of deception in the way he manipulates the viewer of JFK to believe there was a conspiracy to kill President John F Kennedy.  This dvd systematically goes about disproving all the ""facts"" presented by Stone in JFK.  Highly recommended and for even greater detail the book by the same name is available as well.  The A&E Shop typically has this dvd in stock if it is unavailable from Amazon.",1349222400,,424,4.626666666666667
