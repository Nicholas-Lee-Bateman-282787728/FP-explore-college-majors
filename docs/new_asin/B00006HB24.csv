7968789,2,B00006HB24,"This DVD is not as bad as other reviewers make it out to be, but it really misses the mark.

The problem is the annoying hostess, Justine Shapiro. She wastes precious time giving us her personal insights on her stay instead of pointing out the major tourist attractions in the area.

No one cares where she is staying (a no-frills ""penthouse"" cabin on top of a roof, seriously??!!) and no one wants to sit through her cringe-inducing ""interviews"" with locals or watch her wait in line for the communal bathroom.

Honestly, 99.9999% of the people renting this DVD will stay at the Motel 6, Days Inn or Ramada and want to SEE the major tourist attractions. But Shapiro seems hellbent on finding the most obscure events possible and shining a spotlight on whomever crawls out from under a rock. Now, if this were called ""Unseen San Francisco"" that would be fine, but this is being marketed as a view of places tourists are likely to go.

At one point a map is shown (this is just before the Muir Woods section). That map would have been extremely helpful if it showed where things are in relation to others. It should have showed the entire Bay Area and highlighted North Beach, Chinatown, Castro District, Mission Street, Fisherman's Worf, Haight Ashbury, Golden Gate Bridge, and Golden Gate Park (which you would never learn from this DVD is not next to the Golden Gate Bridge), so we could see how things are connected and how to plan a day trip more efficiently.

The one highlight on this DVD is riding on a cable car and seeing how the driver works the levers.

But there's no mention of MUNI or BART (mass transit), and this video was made in 1997 (despite the 2004 copyright).

Is there live theater in San Francisco? You'd never know from watching this tour guide. Museums? Fine or casual dining? Wouldn't know by watching this. Shapiro also doesn't pay a toll and drive across the Bay Bridge or the Golden Gate Bridge or even mention the major sports teams or venues in the area. She kills the hour by hanging out with a hippie chick near Haight Ashbury, takes a gay history tour in the Castro District, interviews the last surviving Alcatraz inmate, and participates in an underground art event staging guerrilla style art attacks all around the city. Couldn't she have just called in sick and let the cameraman go to the hot tourist spots?

This is a real missed opportunity. But fast forward through anytime the hostess is speaking and you'll see a few things worth noting.",1250899200,,2483,4.640091116173121
7968790,2,B00006HB24,"The US is a big beautiful country of varying natural sightseeing in any destination imaginable as architecture and colourfulness of a human creativity.

New York City and San Francisco are two cities I recommend everyone to definitely visit in the USA, and this video-guide has evoked my personal memories with disappointedly short glimpse at SF hardly convincible for tourists investing substantial funds in a trance-continental journey especially.",1217635200,,449,5.701492537313433
7968791,1,B00006HB24,"If you want a brief, poorly executed tour of San Francisco counter-culture then this is the DVD for you.  However, if you actually want to learn about the city and/or plan your trip there, find something else.  A total disappointment.",1203206400,4,234,4.825
7968792,3,B00006HB24,"This profile does a good job of reinforcing the image of San Francisco as a  hippie mecca. If that's the San Francisco you're interested in then you'll enjoy this DVD. I found it, though, to be too outlandish and would have enjoyed a more conservative and mainstream take on the city by the Bay.

From a practical perspective most of the hotels and activities will likely be unsuited for backpackers: the hotels are too pricey and the activities too time consuming, seasonal, or too expensive. Also, a day trip to the wine country or Yosemite are curiously missing.

The price here on Amazon is excessive for a 45 minute video with little lasting appeal. I was lucky enough to find this at the library and borrowed it because I was interested in visiting the city. Unfortunately, the San Francisco shown here is not the one I'm interested in visiting.",1187308800,5,851,4.697986577181208
7968793,1,B00006HB24,"This video is less about the city of San Francisco and more about some oddball characters that live within its confines. I expected more of a travelogue style video that deals with the scenery and attractions. If I had never been to San Francisco and wanted a video to make my decision of whether to go or not, viewing this would make me not want to go. There is nothing in it to make me excited about wanting to go there. This is just not the case with San Francisco. It is an amazingly beautiful city with many, many attractions. No wonder it's my favorite American city (and I'm from the New York city area.) Get this video if you are curious about some of the odd people there or are a completist. Just don't expect a lot. I sold mine quickly after viewing it.",1111449600,2,764,4.275862068965517
