8621389,4,B00G8UVK5U,"What a hoot! This is a great animal, baseball, human film. There's a bit of everything. Love between humans and animals. Greedy bad guys. Baseball. What's not to like. The only reason I took off one star is it's a bit too long. Even so, the ending is worth waiting for. You'll just feel good when it's over. Other reviewers have told you the story and praised the animation and graphics. All I can add is a ditto from me. Good movie for the whole family.",1532217600,,454,4.290697674418604
8621390,4,B00G8UVK5U,"Directed by Yong-hwa Kim (200 Pounds Beauty Take Off), South Korean-Chinese family picture Mr. Go (Mi-seu-teo Go) is about a circus gorilla named Ling Ling, and his trainer, a 15-year old girl named Wei Wei (played by Xu Jiao, better known as the little boy in Stephen Chows CJ7.). But Wei Weis circus troupe is heavily in debt now because of the earthquake that hit China.

Wei Wei and Ling Ling travel to South Korea to join a professional baseball team, last years tail-ender Doosan Bears. With incredible power and bat-swinging skills, Ling Ling or Mr. Go becomes an instant sensation, but will their winning streak continue?

Dong-il Song (200 Pounds Beauty) plays an unscrupulous agent Sung Chung-su. Japanese actor J Odagiri (Shinobi) plays the owner of Chunichi Dragons with a unique haircut. But the best part of the film is of course the special effects, especially Ling Ling using performance capture, shot against the packed ballpark. The visual effects may not be the best, but still pretty impressive.

Based on a Korean comic The 7th Team, Mr. Go is basically a one-joke comedy extended over two hours. It is a bit too long, I think, but thanks to fine acting and effects, the comedy is enjoyable.",1400976000,2,1212,4.845410628019324
8621391,5,B00G8UVK5U,"What a super film! You've undoubtedly read the synopsis in the description. It doesn't even begin to do this film justice. Whether you're a baseball fan or an animal film lover, this movie is top-notch entertainment from the word ""Go"" (!). Young Weiwei travels to Korea with Mr Go, the baseball playing gorilla, to sign a contract with a Korean baseball team in an effort to raise money to pay off debts for the circus she performed with and later owned in China, and the film's entertainment never stops.

The animation in this film is outstanding, and Mr Go is one of the most sympathetic animated apes since King Kong. The entire cast is outstanding, with some fabulous humor, exciting game sequences, and an eye-popping final sequence as Mr Go saves the day in a battle against a surprise pitcher in the last inning of the final game of the championships.

Some sequences may be rather intense for the smallest of small-fry viewers, but 9-10 years and above will love this film. As there is no English dub soundtrack, youngsters should be of age to comfortably read the subtitles in order to be able to follow and enjoy the movie. (If they've never dealt with subtitles in a film before, this may be just the film to begin their exposure).

Spoken in both Chinese and Korean with English subtitles, I can't recommend this film highly enough. I'm ready to watch it a second time.",1397692800,2,1382,4.655737704918033
