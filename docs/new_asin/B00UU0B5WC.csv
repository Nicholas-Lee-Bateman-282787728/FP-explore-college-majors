7071179,5,B00UU0B5WC,"(Clown) was a movie I have been wanting to see since I heard about it! I'm a huge Eli Roth fan and he didn't disappoint with this .I found the story to be quite original and unique. The main character Kent played by (Andy Powers) finds an old clown suit ""that unbeknownst to him has
an evil and terrifying history"" he puts it on for his son's birthday party to play (Dummo The Clown)  and it actually starts taking root on and in his body.

He finds out the suit is cursed and is turning him into a demon that eats children. The transformation effects are really good especially when he is completely transformed,he looks really freaky and so cool. There's was a nice amount of gore but not as much as I expected, and it was all done extremely well. They don't shy away from showing children getting eaten or killed either.

The story got a little bogged down in a couple of places but that's such a small thing to complain about. There was a found Footage scene that was quite chilling as well.

The fact that they took the movie seriously said alot about the confidence they had in the story because it could have gone really wrong fast but it worked perfectly. All in all I think it's one of the best horror films I've seen in quite awhile.",1435536000,12,1243,4.3218884120171674

7071222,3,B00UU0B5WC,"Its a story as old as timeMan puts on clown suit, man cannot get clown suit off, man turns into a child-eating demon. Ok so its not as old as time but it is the plot behind Clown a film produced by Eli Roth and helmed by first-time Director Jon Watts. Now, why is Jon Watts significant? Well, somehow Jon Watts whose previous directorial credits include episodes of the Onion News Network has been tapped to direct Spider-Man: Homecoming, the latest reboot of the Marvel character since Marvel Studios and Sony reached an agreement to share the character who made his first (rebooted) appearance in Captain America: Civil War. Watts certainly impressed the right people although I cant say it was based upon this film alone.clown

Kent McCoy (Powers) is a real estate agent and loving father to his son, Jack. When the clown who was supposed to appear at Jacks birthday cancels at the last minute, Kent steps in after finding an old clown costume, complete with multi-color wig and big red nose, in the basement of a house he is selling. After falling asleep still wearing the costume, Kent finds that the next morning he is unable to remove the suit which has adhered to his skin. His wife uses pliers to pull off the nose as well as big chunk of Kents skin. Panicked, he tries to cut the suit off but only succeeds in giving himself a large gash. Even the rainbow wig has seemingly merged permanently with his own hair.

Kent tracks down Herbert Karlsson (Peter Stromare), the brother of the deceased man who owned the home where he found the costume. Karlsson relates that it is not a costume at all but the skin and hair of an ancient Scandinavian demon known as a Cloyne which needs to devour five children to survive. Karlsson attempts to kill Kent as the only means of stopping the demon. However, Kent manages to escape. But the demons hunger soon takes control as Kent can no longer hold off the urges to devour local children and sets his eyes on his own son.

We are used to seeing teenagers as victims in horror films but rarely do we see the targets to be kids this young (10 or under) and that makes Clown a typically brutal Eli Roth film even though the direct violence takes place off screen and we see only the gory results. Kents transformation into a demon is methodical and, at times, painfully slow as is the entire movie as a whole. The low energy tone of Watts direction makes me wonder how he will handle a superhero action film. One could overlook this if it were building suspense but there isn't a great deal of that outside of the climax and an earlier, harrowing seen in one of those play places as the clown stalks several kids.

Its a mostly unknown cast outside of Stromare who always brings his salacious brand of creepiness to every role he plays. Clown isn't a bad movie. However, its not riveting either. Watch it on a Friday night when you need a quick diversion.

7071256,3,B00UU0B5WC,"I had high hopes for this movie after seeing the trailer a year or so ago. Did not read much about it because I did not want to spoil anything. At first I thought it was going to be a sort of straight to the point campfire scary story. It had a great idea with actors that could pull it off and very scary imagery. The problem is is that it did not come across as a simple campfire story and it was not complex with a deep background  either.  Without getting into details that would spoil the movie, the Parts they touched on that were interesting like the origins of the suit could (which could have been built upon with a longer flashback) and really made it scary.  And the little clown sketch book that looks like a guide or bible - it could have had more background. Great idea, just not delivered with enough story.  Some scary imagery on top of a good idea with no meat.  I guess that's why it took awhile for it to come out. I saw the trailer at least a year or two ago.  They were probably trying to sell it and edit something out of it.",1472083200,,1047,4.082926829268293
7071257,4,B00UU0B5WC,"Not to be that guy, but after reading though the comments here I cant help but feel that most of the glowing 5-star reviews are from people who were already dedicated fans of Eli Roth and would take anything with his name attached to it at face value and rave regardless. I did enjoy the Hostel movies back in the day, but otherwise Im not terribly familiar with his work and have to look at Clown a bit more objectively. That said, I didn't dislike the film, but I did find it to be a bit uneven in tone, managing to elicit both unintentional chuckles and genuine suspense at different times.

I won't rehash the plot as many others have done already, but at least we can all agree the premise is unique and at no time did I find my attention wavering. I like how there was a bit of demonic lore involved instead of simply making it about yet another psychopath running around in a clown suit. (Dont worry, Im not really spoiling anything. A lot of background is established early on.) It took me a while to warm up to the acting; the first half hour or so had a very made-for-TV feel about it along with some eyeroll-inducing dialogue which had me worried about just what kind of movie I got myself into, but somewhere around the halfway point once the stakes get high and it sort of develops into the wifes story everyone becomes much more likeable/believable in their roles. The gore is fleeting but effectively used, and as the film progresses it manages to capture a certain overall eerie and unsettling tone that keeps you on your toes. In fact, the scene which takes place in the Chuck E. Cheese jungle gym is probably one of the most suspenseful and perfectly cinematographed scenes I have seen in a horror film in recent years, if not ever.

In the end I can see both sides of the coin. There are things to love about Clown, due in no small part to the inherent scary nature of the subject, but again, five stars might be a bit overzealous. I personally think it falls somewhere around three and a half stars but I will round up to four for the purposes of this review, giving it the benefit of the doubt. I realize this is a Canadian-made film but perhaps with a slightly bigger budget or more experienced or well-known cast some of the rough edges might have been smoothed out. However, mixed bag that it is, its still a solid enough effort and worth watching at least once for the curious.

About this bluray release specifically, the only included special feature is a short making of segment in which Eli Roth and some of the other filmmakers discuss the thought processes behind making the film and how it came to be, and we also get some insight on how the special effects were created. Its pretty interesting, actually, but be aware it only runs about 6 minutes.",1471996800,2,2780,4.436399217221135

7071262,5,B00UU0B5WC,"I just saw a preview for this movie over on YouTube, and I'm mad. I want to watch it, but how can I when its nor USA dvd player compatiable? I have plenty of players in my house, but what if NONE of them are compatiable if I bought this movie and none of my players can play it?

Can't some studio company reformat the dvds or something so that they WILL work on American made DVDs?",1457740800,,382,3.961038961038961
7071263,2,B00UU0B5WC,"Dont let the other reviewers fool you. This movie isn't really that great. I bought it for two reasons. One, because of all the controversy, and two, Eli Roth had a hand in producing it. Ever since the Hostel movies, I have made a point to watch anything he has a hand in. The reason for all the controversy is, not so much what is shown on the screen, but because of the overall theme of the movie. Its about a clown that eats young children. Seriously though, the movie isn't really that graphic. The Walking Dead is 100% MORE graphic than this movie. It NEVER shows him actually killing anybody. Whenever he wants to eat a kid, the camera pans away from the scene and you are left with just the sounds. Another thing too is there are several holes in the story. I won't say what they are because to do so would give you spoilers, but really there are several things that happen in this movie that makes no sense. Some scenes actually contradict others (for those of you who have seen this movie, Im referring to the meat cleaver in the shoulder scene). As far as how to watch a region B disc in the USA, well, there are ways around that if you know what you are doing. The safest way is to buy a region-free bluray player, but if you do that, be prepared to spend a couple two or three hundred dollars more than a standard region A player. Anyway, the movie Is worth a watch or two but thats about it. If you are a collector of rare and/or controversial movies like me, maybe youd want to buy a copy. I predict that this movie will eventually be released in the U.S. but as of now, it hasn't...",1457654400,8,1597,4.222222222222222
7071264,5,B00UU0B5WC,"This movie is amazing! Why isn't it out in the states???? Okay... the movie is in English. I really like all the main characters. The acting is really good. The story and back story are spine tingling. There are some really good scares, I like the music, and the special effects are brilliant. On a scale of 1-10 in horror, I would give this a solid 9. Why not ten? Because the story is so good and I ended up so deeply involved with the characters, especially the main guy, that there was a little sadness and compassion that stayed with me in even the most frightening moments. I don't think this was a bad thing, I think it's because the movie is complex and carefully planned-- a far cry from all these mainstream straight-up horror flix that are crapped out with little emphasis on anything but gore.",1457395200,2,805,4.445945945945946

7071267,5,B00UU0B5WC,loved this movie but why no USA release? It made it really hard to get and watch. With a such a great movie there should have been a USA format release since so many other countries got a release.,1451174400,,196,4.051282051282051
7071268,5,B00UU0B5WC,"Wow!  This is really terrific horror film that could have done solid business in the U.S.  I guess that the Chuck E, Cheese honchos may have had a little problem with the kiddie slaughter happening in one of their joints.  Just guessing.....but having no U.S. release at all seems odd.  Seek this treat out for a memorable, creepy good time.",1445990400,2,341,4.633333333333334

It's good Creepy fun, and kinda sad at  the same time. Lead actor was great. Which begs the question, ""How come most of the freshest and best movies nowadays are low to moderate budget""? Good on ya, Eli. Keep up the good work! Thanks.",1522886400,,403,4.597222222222222

8708289,4,B00UU0B5WC,"Definitely a film worth watching.  Early scenes have lots of gallows humor and sight giggles related to costume; however, things start getting VERY dark and scary from the 2nd act on.  My only complaint is that it took too long for clown to take on his most sinister incarnation and at that point we have too brief of a time spent with him (last 10 min of movie).",1508025600,,363,4.323529411764706
