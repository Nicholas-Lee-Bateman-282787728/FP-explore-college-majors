6156708,4,B00HEM9Q5W,"I am steering our 10 month old son towards this series since I like it's values and also like that it is not a typical mind-numbing, scene-flashing over-stimulating animated series. The series is about ""trainees"" who learn the value of friendship, telling the truth, listening carefully, persisting under adversity, completing tasks, resolving conflict and similar values. And yes - we limit his TV watching to short periods or when in the car.
From a mechanically-inclined engineering type adult's perspective, I actually get a kick out the great detail that is used in the animation (it's actually more computer-generated than traditionally animated). Things like the details of the switching mechanisms to the rubber-nubbed mats used along the edge of the platforms. Granted these are not required or important but add to it's quality and realism, in my opinion (did I say ""add to its realism"" about a talking train cartoon?). Anyway, this series is only run at limited times, so I purchased a few DVD's. All were very well priced - actually way cheaper than I would've guessed. At this age he mainly is interested in the colors and whimsical nature, but I think it's a wholesome program to grow with.

Update:  Our son is 17 months old now and still enjoys this series. At this age, he obviously understands things more, imitates the train sounds, points, etc.",1441670400,4,1364,5.004405286343612
6156709,5,B00HEM9Q5W,Such a great deal and value for your money. We travel a lot and this is so nice to have.  There are multiple episodes per DVD which are about an hour a piece and so happy with this.  My son is in a Chuggington phase where this is all he wants to watch so it is perfect for home and in the cars.  I would order again from this seller!,1441670400,3,333,3.7285714285714286
6156710,5,B00HEM9Q5W,"We have (2) Boys ages 3 and 1.5.  We were finally able to put this DVD pack to good use.

Our first lengthy trip in the car while waiting in a traffic line at the county fair, and we popped this DVD in.  Boys absolutely LOVED it, and we only had to use 1 DVD!  Great value for 4+ hours of entertainment.  We also noticed that the first 6 episodes on the only DVD we have watched so far, haven't been seen by our littles on TV.  We didn't recognize a single episode which is great, since it keeps our boys attention so well!

A+++ as I'm sure we will get plenty of use out of these DVD's on our upcoming Florida Trip!",1439769600,,616,3.959349593495935
