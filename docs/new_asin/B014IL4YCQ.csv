8730884,3,B014IL4YCQ,"Mostly intact.  These were advertised as remastered but with original dialogue etc and they were...mostly.  I'll admit that I don't know exactly what remastering involves but I'd have been satisfied with higher resolution and maybe a little color enhancement.  However, someone decided these old classics needed new titles.  To accomplish this they simply cut the opening scenes that included the old titles. Although there was no missing dialogue, there is footage missing none the less.  Ex. in Pippi on the Run, the title scene included Pippi riding at a gallop atop her horse at sunset.  No more.  Err. The scratchy old titles and the footage that accompanied them were as much a part of the charm of these films as the silly overdubs and whatever else you liked about these movies.  Adding insult to injury the font chosen for the new bits is...well lame. This will probably seem picky to most but I wanted to put it out there.

Having said that the unaltered portions look and sound as remembered and are still enjoyable.",1523923200,4,1027,4.85632183908046
