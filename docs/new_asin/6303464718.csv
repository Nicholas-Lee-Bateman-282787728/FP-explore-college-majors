650907,3,6303464718,"This comedy/musical extravaganza, set mostly aboard an ultra-modern luxury liner, does not hold up as well as most of W.C. Fields' films.  It is overlong and rather dull in spots, but several funny scenes (with Fields, of course) almost compensate.  Surpringly, the best scene is that in which Bob Hope sings, for the first time, the song that has become indelibly associated with him for the past 63 years, ""Thanks For the Memory"".  It is a duet with Shirley Ross, and it is done not as a funny novelty song, but as a poignant one.  Worth seeing.",999993600,14,547,4.608247422680412

7847478,5,6303464718,"The Big Broadcast of 1938 was the final entry in the Big Broadcast film series. Although Bob Hope only got fifth billing in the opening credits (W.C. Fields had star billing above the movie title), this musical comedy is a landmark film because it boasts Old Ski-Nose's debut in full length features. The flimsy plot involves an ocean liner race between the SS Gigantic and the SS Colossal, but that storyline serves merely as a staging area for the stale vaudevillian routines, the throwaway gags, the mostly forgettable songs, the dull specialty numbers, and one dubious cartoon sequence. Already with Fields and Hope's famous schnozzes on board, this movie only needed Jimmy Durante in it to achieve some kind of nasal trifecta. But, you know what? The routines and songs may be old and creaky, but this musical still has enough charm and the funny in it to be worth a gander.

W.C. Fields may have headlined, but his star power does not overwhelm here. It's Bob Hope who carries this movie - as much as an ensemble cast member can carry a movie. As radio broadcaster Buzz Fielding, Hope tries to put on a radio show while contending with three ex-wives and his new girl, Dorothy (Dorothy Lamour), who is on the verge of straying with the hunky inventor. This film offers other romantic entanglements, but the subplot that tugs best at the heartstrings is Buzz's amiable relationship with ex-wife Cleo (winsomely played by Shirley Ross). It's pretty obvious that sparks still may fly between the two. Hope and Ross have great chemistry together, and they make a fun couple as they joust verbally. The highlight of the film comes an hour into it when Buzz and Cleo reminisce at a bar and segue smoothly into a riveting, bittersweet rendition of ""Thanks for the Memories."" This number was carried out by Hope and Ross with conversational, off-the-cuff flair that was still very personal and emotional. Apparently, writer Damon Runyon was so taken with the performance of that song that he chose to review only that portion of the film. And, while I don't consider it to be a showstopper, Dorothy Lamour sweetly croons ""You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth.""

W.C. Fields had little moments here and there, most notably in the outrageous golf and pool sequences (hey, the man cheats!). Throughout the movie, he resorts to his patented mumbled insults and putdowns, although one lady does get one back when she impertinently asks, ""Is that a tomato he's eating? Or is that his nose?"" But I had a bigger chuckle over Martha Raye's bit where she raucously sings, ""Oh, Mama,"" whilst being tossed and flipped around by sailors.

Other negligible subplots revolve around a $50,000 bet, a bad luck daughter who cracks any mirror she gazes at, and an inventor unable to make his invention function. But all that is fluff. This film is mindless spools of fun that would otherwise be relegated to the back closets of Hollywood if not for its two saving graces: the debut of Hope as a feature film player and the introduction of his signature song ""Thanks for the Memories."" On a lesser note, this is also the first time Hope teams up on-screen with Martha Raye and, more importantly, with Dorothy Lamour. For those things, The Big Broadcast of 1938 must be considered a key cinematic event.

Lastly, for those interested, the SS Gigantic wins the race. Sorry for the spoiler.",1488240000,,3369,4.783505154639175

I knew only those that they recorded for sale and I got on cassette tape. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates Bob Hope. Of course it is quite dated which I do not have occasion to mind I am 89 years old going on a thousand!.
Shirley and Bob subsequently also recorded a song called: ""Two Sleepy People""",1404777600,,458,4.215909090909091

7847486,2,6303464718,"It's easy to see why W.C. Fields hated ""The Big Broadcast of 1938,"" since his unique talents were ill-suited for Paramount's musical-comedy revue. The few memorable moments in this 90-minute hodgepodge can be found during the first hour  highlighted by the Great Man's surreal golf routine and Bob Hope's ""Thanks for the Memory."" If director Mitchell Leisen was hoping to recapture the vaudevillian spirit of 1933's ""International House,"" he completely missed the mark.",1180742400,8,469,5.424657534246576
