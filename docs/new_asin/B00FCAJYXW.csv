8614416,4,B00FCAJYXW,"All of the material on this hour-long DVD has been released on home video before. It first saw life as Cinemax Sessions program on Cinemax cable. (Some folks may not remember HBOs cable partner in the 1980s. It was an hour long special. This was released shortly thereafter by HBO Home Video as Chet Atkins and Friends on VHS.  It never came out from HBO on DVD and the VHS copies bring a lot on ebay and Amazon. In 2010 it aired on PBS as an hour long special.  That same year a company named Digital Row LLC released it on DVD under the Title Chet Atkins: Certified Guitar Player. Ive not seen it by Amazon lists it as a 90 minute running time. This too is bringing pretty high prices on eBay and Amazon.

This newest version  from Laser Media  is the hour-long show with the opening and ending credits removed. This means that the finale Corrina, Corrina is missing too as the credits ran over this song.
The video and sound quality is fine since this was an HBO/Cinemax production and the entertainment value is high with Atkins performing with Emmy Lou Harris, The Everly Brothers, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings Mark Knopfler and Michael McDonald.  There may be copies going for less than the previous editions. But, if you already own one of the prior editions, you don't need this release; you already have it.

It gets FIVE Stars for entertainment but only three stars for the missing credits and finale. Net rating is 4 stars.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
