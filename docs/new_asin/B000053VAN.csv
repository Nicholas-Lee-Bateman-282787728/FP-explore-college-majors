1390589,5,B000053VAN,"""Cheaters"" is an interesting study of the differences between suburban and inner-city schools and the biases that exist when an ethnically diverse academic decathlon team from a poor neighborhood beats the reigning champions from a plush suburb.  The startling defeat is challenged without any proof of misconduct and as a viewer you really sympathize with the inner-city kids, even though they cheated.
The performances from Jeff Daniels and young Jena Malone ('Bastard out of Carolina' and 'Stepmom') really hold the film together and keeps you rooting for these kids against the hypocrisy of the school board and the rich kids who have everything handed to them.
This is one of the better HBO films to come out over the last year (in addition to the amazing 'The Corner') and will really make you think about the disparity and difference between socio-economic groups and the stigmatization some face when they triumph against the odds - no matter what the circumstances.",980208000,8,974,5.1257861635220126
1390590,5,B000053VAN,"Jena Malone stars in this movie about cheating on scholastic competition. Though she cheated, she is suppose to be the protagonist, and are we suppose to side with her? I think it is a bad theme, if it is meant to say cheating is okay. I like this movie because I like all Jena Malone movies. Scene where she was interogated, she seems to wear no bra, just a tight white T-shirt. You get to see her puffy nipples, so that was the highlight of the movie for me.",1202515200,,460,4.179775280898877
1390591,4,B000053VAN,"I'm not sure how this movie premiered.  I think it was on MTV, if I'm not mistaken!  Did it come out in theaters?

In any case, it was certainly a sleeper.  I had definitely heard of it, but it was not ""OVERHYPED"" as so many other films these days.  So I wasn't expecting much!  So imagine my delight, when I came across this DVD in the bargain bin at Walmart, and decided to take a chance!

Well, I'm glad I did!  This movie was incredibly good!  It really made you think about College (and high-school) life, and whether or not its worth it to cheat on an exam!  There was great music, great personality clashes, awesome dialogue, great storytelling from the main female character.

I have actually re-watched this movie 3 or 4 times (probably more, but don't want to exaggerate.), and never get tired of it.  It is a great lesson in ethics watching this movie.

Highly recommended!

1390592,5,B000053VAN,This movie presents a real moral dilemna..should students who have always been thought of as losers take a chance and cheat. The teacher has the toughest decision to make-weather to let his students cheat and what to do if they get caught. Jeff Daniels plays the part well-showing how he is torn-wanting his students to get recognition and wanting to teach them right from wrong. This movie has moral questions that we all face.,1129766400,4,428,4.797297297297297
1390593,4,B000053VAN,"I went to Steinmetz High School before this happened.  Steinmetz was not located in the poorer section of Chicago and not only poor kids attended Steinmetz.  I think this movie was good.  I'm a little disappointed though that Steinmetz is only recognized as the school that cheated.  I no longer live in Chicago, however, when I'm asked ""Where did you go to school?""  I reply ""Did you ever see that movie ""Cheaters""?""  or Hugh Hefner (Playboy) graduated from there.  (Betcha didn't know that!)  As for Whitney Young, yes at that time they were a bunch of crybabies.  I hope this movie goes as a lesson to the kids who feel compelled to cheat.  Who knows, they may make a sequel to this movie, eventually.",1112400000,4,704,4.604838709677419
1390594,5,B000053VAN,"It's amazing that this sort of thing really happens.  But as the movie went along, I could really feel for these charecters and wished they could beat the system.  Jena Malone and Dov Tiefenbach are wonderful in the movie...and I never knew Jeff Daniels could pull off such a serious role.",1108684800,3,289,4.647058823529412
1390595,5,B000053VAN,"Cheaters is about the 1995 Academic Decathlon team from Steinmetz High School. Steinmetz HS is an overcrowded, underfunded school located in a poorer section of Chicago. Most of the students appear to be from blue-collar backgrounds. Gerard Plecki, an English teacher (well played be Jeff Daniels) organizes the AD team to try to compete at regionals, particulary against favorite and rival, Whitney Young High School, portrayed as a magnet school. At first the morale and motivation is high amongst the Steinmetz team but as they severely lose to Whitney Young at regionals, they increasingly view their situation as hopeless and lack confidence to compete at the state finals. However an interesting dilemma comes up as one of the team members comes up with a copy of the test for the state finals. Should the team cheat or stay honest? If they cheat, will they get away with it?

I thought this movie was excellent and honest. Although it wasn't right for Steinmetz to cheat, the movie shows that the world is not a level playing field and that people from more white-collar walks of life have much higher advantages and potential for success than those from blue-collar walks of life.",1108684800,5,1188,4.94
1390596,5,B000053VAN,"Haven't we all been there? Wishing we could be better than someone else? Wishing that we had our turn in the spotlight? This is exactly how the movie ""Cheaters"" affected me. I found it truly amazing that this movie was made on a true story like this. The plot is really incredible and actually makes you ponder the question ""What would I do in this situation?"" Jeff Daniels and Jena Malone give such incredible performances in this movie. I believe that they are very convincing. If you are in the mood to be emotionally touched by a movie, ""Cheaters"" is the true direction for you to head in.",1104364800,2,593,4.5
1390597,5,B000053VAN,"Whether the movie is accurate or not makes no difference.  It was a interesting movie.  Anyone who watched this movie and was not reminded of something from their past, has done a good job of lying to themself.

1390598,5,B000053VAN,"I never tender reviews but I think that a reply to the already posted reviews is in order.
First, cheating is wrong.  Driving too fast is wrong.  The best applicant not getting the job, office, etc. is wrong.  Not paying your fair share of taxes is wrong.  Getting off by a legal technicality although you committed the crime is wrong.
My point is that cheating is wrong but that doesn't necessarily make it a bad choice.
A chasm exists between reality and the pithy moral/ethical aphorisms we were taught as children.
Have you ever told anyone when breaking up with them (or the other way around) ""it isn't you, it's my fault"" when you knew that it really was them, but you didn't want to hurt their feelings?
This is reality.  Reality is dirty, unfair, and it bites.
This is the lesson of this movie.  Don't pitty these students or hate them.  Just recall my paraphrase of the last lines of the flick, when one of the cheaters remarks:
  ""Yeah I got into college.  The admissions officer thought  my academic team experience built character...I learned more about life during the experience than any other time...If one of my students cheated, would I turn them the little bastards in?  You bet, because if they can get past me then just maybe they are ready for the real world"".
This is so familiar to me since, as a teacher, I see students all the time who are cheating or in the throes of the ethical dilemma about doing so.  I never tell them one way or the other, but I know that many of them do cheat because I'm fairly bright and aware, but I am sure that there are some who even get by me.
Life [is tough], just deal.
Thanks for reading :-B",1061683200,9,1650,4.405940594059406
1390599,5,B000053VAN,"The movie doesn't compare to ""Stand and Deliver"" because Jaime Escalante, the teacher in ""Stand and Deliver"" worked hard with his students teaching them mathematics and bolstering their self-esteem to pass the Advance Placement Calculus Test.  The students were of Latino descent and most of them were from the barrio and the media perception on them was negative.  He proved them wrong by standing by his students and delivering to the mainstream that these students weren't as stupid as they were made out to be.
In this movie, the teacher Gerald Plecki taught his students to cheat out of frustration with the school's lack of interest in promoting academics and the drastic budget cuts on the use of equipment (photocopier).  Plecki wanted to ensure the students that they were bright and could win the decathalon despite what was happening.  But disappointment came when they wer in fifth place.  To be first place and go on to nationals they would have to pump harder into their studies.  But some of the students had other responsibilities like an afterschool job or babysitting siblings when the parent had to work.  The only way for them to get into nationals was to cheat.  With help from a student in the group, they were set to win.  Through the exhilaration of being champions, they never counted on being thrusted into the other side of the spotlight.
""Stand and Deliver"" was a triumph for a teacher who didn't give up on his students and for the students who didn't give up on themselves.  ""Cheaters"" was a downfall for a teacher who was tired of being kicked around by the elitist, the school board, and the faculty and for the students, despite their academic abilities, were tired of being made to feel that they don't count.
Nobody likes a snitch as much as dishonesty, but Irwin was in his right to say what he had to say.  He watched as his fellow classmates were winning medals, while he was playing judge, which was tearing him up inside.  He wrote it down on paper in class, which he had to cover his tracks for the sake of the school and the teacher but it was too much to bear when he knew he wasn't a part of the group anymore.  He contacted a reporter and gave her the scoop.
Talk about honesty!  Despite what had happened, there are some people out there that put on a great show when they are doing far worse than the students and the teacher.  To sum it up, like ""Stand and Deliver"", the movie was great to watch.",1041206400,5,2444,4.573394495412844
1390600,2,B000053VAN,"I attend Whitney Young, the school that was effectively villianized in Cheaters.  I was incensed while reading the reviews that customers have given this movie.  There are a few common misconceptions that people seems to believe, and it's entirely the fault of irresponsible filmmakers seeking a better plot through sensationalism.  Prior to this film's release, the monitors in our lunchrooms advertised the movie because of our schools involvement.  However, after there was a screening to the staff of the school, we were told not to believe the film, that it was not all true.  Since no WY faculty was consulted for the film-- only Steinmetz faculty-- it's obvious why a bias existed.  Whitney Young is NOT a suburban school.  It is in the heart of Chicago.  We don't recieve any special funding.  Our bathroom stalls are written on,we have disciplinary problems, the usual.  True, maybe ours aren't as bad as Steinmetz', but we are in no way treated any differently by the Chicago PublicSchools.  The late Acadec coach who was shown betting in the movie was not the type of man who would do such a thing.  our cheerleaders don't go to acadec competitions!  we're not cocky, we don't think we're better than anyone else and we're one of the most diverse schools in chicago.  the acadec team alone probably represents at least 10 different races. So as far as accuracy, this film is for the birds.",1027555200,11,1400,4.852320675105485
1390601,5,B000053VAN,"I was lucky enough to catch Cheaters on HBO around two in the morning.  Though it might, at first, appear to be just another overly ""hip"" teen comedy, Cheaters is actually one of the best films about high school that I've ever seen.  Nicely blending comedy and coming-of-age drama, Cheaters tells the true story of how underdog Stienmetz High School won the 1995 Illinios Academic Decathalon just to then lose their accolades when it was revealed they'd cheated.  As someone who was a part of the whole AcDec subculture in high school, I can say that this film managed to perfectly capture the feeling and the atmosphere of that competition, showing not only how it often gives a much needed sense of purpose to students who, otherwise, don't have a place in the highly regimented caste system of high school but also how public, urban-based schools often face a great deal of elitist bias in favor of more exclusive private and magnet schools.  While the film never makes the mistake of excusing or trivializing the cheating, it also makes it clear that the students of Stienmetz and similar schools often are treated unfairly by a stagnant system that has decided to give up on them.  In the end, it's hard not to feel sympathetic to these students even as they cheat and it's also hard not to feel that, whatever mistakes were made, the actions taken as a result, by both the media and the Chicago School Board, were even worse.  The film perfectly captures the exhiliration of the student's initial victory and, just as perfectly, the terror of being judged in the mad feeding frenzy that grew out of the Stienmetz Scandal.  (In one of the film's best scenes, we watch as investigators tell lies of their own to trick the students into confessing just to then give a press conference where they tell reporters that the students are the ""coldest,"" most calculating bunch of liars they've ever experienced.)  The film benefits from a talented cast of mostly unknown young actors who manage to flawlessly blend into an always-watchable ensemble.  The stand-out amongst the younger actors is Jena Malone, showing a previously untapped range as the most unrepentant of the cheaters.  She manages to be chillingly single-minded in the way only a teenager can while at the same time displaying an appealing vulnerability.  Too smart for the world of teenagers yet to young for the world of adults, Malone gives a performance similar to Reese Whitherspoon's ground-breaking and brilliant work in Election (which, itself, makes a nice companion piece to this film) but at the same time claims this character as uniquely her own and establishes herself as an underrated actress to watch.  As the AcDec coach, Jeff Daniels gives probably his best performance since the Purple Rose of Cairo, bringing some wonderfully ambigous shadings to a character who, at first, just seems to be a stereotypical wimp.  After years of appearing in roles not up to his talent, Daniels reminds us that he is one of our most unpredictable actors and his performance here, bravely playing a character who isn't always likeable, will keep viewers guessing as to whether Daniels is the story's hero or its villian.  Amongst the other performances, mention should be made of Paul Sorvino who gives a brilliantly comical performance as the school's clueless principal.  Even as one is left to ponder the many issues raised by the film, it's hard not to smile at just the image of Sorvino, joyously and ineptly dancing at a school pep rally while the band plays a listless version of ""Gonna Fly Now.""  Its a small, almost cliched role but Sorvino brings a touch of inspired lunacy to both it and the film.
John Stockwell, who both directed and wrote the script, has made a name for himself by making films that deal with flawed human beings whose only real mistake is realizing that the world is made up of shades of gray even as everyone else insists that everything is black-and-white.  A former actor who, like the students of Stienmetz, never quite got the appreciation he deserved, Stockwell has shown with this film, his later Crazy/Beautiful, and his script for Breast Men to have a valuable and unique talent for catching the absurdities of everyday life, consistently crafting scenes that manage to be both surprising and true-to-life.  (Certainly one of the highlights here is a small but knowing scene where Daniels and his students plan their post-scandal damage control by watching Stand and Deliver, the prototype for the many dedicated-teacher-in-urban-school-films that this film both comments on and sends up).  With Cheaters, Stockwell maintains a perfect combination of the absurd and the realistic while keeping the story moving at just the right pace.  As well, Stockwell takes one of the most overused techniques of modern film -- the montage scored by an alternative top ten hit -- and actually manages to pull it off.  This alone makes him nearly unique amongst Hollywood's young directors.  Perhaps even more so than Crazy/Beautiful, Cheaters proves that John Stockwell is one of the most interesting unknown directors out there and stands as a glowing testament to both his talent and the talents of his unsung actors.  By all means, see this film.",1013990400,24,5243,4.926220204313281
1390602,5,B000053VAN,"I caught this movie by accident, and I'm glad I did.

Cheating is wrong, right? But, most of us have done it. I, too. Let's say there's a test. You don't cheat, but you study. You get a 90, a great grade. But everyone else doesn't study, cheats, and get's 100's. That's the side this movie shows.

It's based on a true story from 1995, in Steimetz high school. The smart kids from a couple high schools compete with either other, and the same school keeps winning over and over, in an unfair manner. Then one of the kids from Steinmetz finds the answers to the test they have to take. Only one girl has to even think about ""if"" they should cheat. The real question is how to get away with it. But obviously, problems arise, and the movie revolves about the group as they plan how to cheat, the media's attention, and the after-effects.

Of course, I was thinking, this is going to be an extremely cheesy movie barely hanging onto the concept of Academic Decathlon (Aca Deca).  What I got was quite a shocker.  It is an excellent movie in all points of view.  My personal favorite part is that it sticks very true to the concept of Aca Deca.  It is very realistic in that aspect and they did a lot of resaearch into how it works.  That to me is the most impressive part.  But you can't let that cover up the brilliant acting done by the entire cast.  It's a wonderful movie and I suggest it to anyone!",1001203200,4,632,4.08130081300813

Right away, you are sucked into the story and its characters, and it just made me so thankful for renting it! There is never a dull moment, and all throughout the film you glued to the screen. Even for a cast of teens, there is NEVER even remotely poor acting. And since the film goes into each character's life, you care so much for them and you really do not want them to get caught. In fact, I was so nervous for them, it was as if you don't know they do. When they do, they feel so bad for them, you almost can't stand it. I really wish I knew the real kids and Dr. Plecki of the Steinmetz scandel. I would love to just talk with them about their experiences, that's what the movie makes you do. Jena Malone, who plays the leader of the group, and Jeff Daniels, just steal the show. Each play their part with brilliance, and you remember them from this movie in my opinion.
Usually, I tell the bad parts of a movie, but I can't think of any for this film except one thing: They get caught. But we already know, so I can't say it counts.

To put it simply, the acting does not do the film justice. Sure, the coach is well played, by the students are feel more like children aspiring to be actors than actors aspiring to be children.
You would never think that a group of naive high school students would even attempt such a plot, or even that they are capable and calculating enough to hold out against the media and investigators for so long.
Welcome to life.  When where you're born is all that determines your future, and when you come to that realization in an hour long ceremony honoring those who have been destined to defeat you, you too would do anything, ANYTHING to turn the tables.
Still, the movie takes too indulgent a view of cheating.  Cheaters never prosper, and Jolie Fitch didn't really learn much.

7930186,5,B000053VAN,"I remember seeing this film for the first time back in 2000 when it first premiered on HBO. I, myself, was about the same age of the teenage characters.

Maybe I liked it and related to it so much cause I was the same age of the characters in the movie, and, had I seen it now being in my early thirties, I might have a slightly different reaction to it.

The film is based on a true story, and is about a group of inner city teens who, along with their Teacher and Coach, are discovered to have cheated to win during the second round of an Academic contest. The film stars Jeff Daniels as their Teacher and Academic contest coach and Jena Malone plays one of the teenage students on the team, both, along with the entire cast, are extremely good and perfectly cast.

As the film plays out, you find yourself rooting for the cheaters hoping that somehow they can get away with the act, which is a true testament to the acting, writing and most importantly the direction. This film is topnotch, even with good musical selections and score, as well as great editing, but unfortunately after HBO initially first aired it some years ago, they haven't replayed it much or revamped the DVD which is still available, but still pretty much bare-bones.

7930191,3,B000053VAN,"This movie is actually pretty good if you don't take into account actual facts as a basis for informing your opinion about the film.

I attended the ""evil"" school depicted in this film.  My senior year in high school was during the time depicted in the film when Steinmetz High School ""beat"" out perennial (they had won 22 of the past 23 years of Acadec competitions as depicted in the film) champs Whitney Young in the Illinois Academic Decathlon.  A bit of real background, Whitney Young is a Magnet high school within the Chicago Public School system.  It is a public school but has selective enrollment.  Whitney Young does not have ""unlimited income"" as portrayed in the film it receives funding just like other public schools in the city.  Certainly any ""extras"" the school receives are a result of fund raising.  Twice a year students are asked to sell items (e.g. candy bars) at about $200 a case to assist with tuition and fee costs.  We had as many problems with malfunctioning toilets, leaky ceilings (there was a perpetual leak in one of the hallways) as any other CPS.  The difference with WY is that the kids attending are considered academically gifted and must ""test into"" Whitney Young via a selective process.  So, it is not a neighborhood school that just anyone can attend.  Also, despite the film's portrayal the school is highly racially diverse 32% African-American, 28% White, 22% Hispanic and 17% Asian. About 1/3 of the kids attending Whitney Young are low income and as I one of those formerly low-income students I can tell you my Mom did not ""know"" anyone to pull any strings to get me into WY.  Now, in the film Whitney Young is shown as being highly elitist and the students are shown as snobby brats.  The statistics of who these kids are hardly bear this out.  In addition, Mr. Minkoff (the Whitney Young Acadec coach) is portrayed as a sleezy slimeball that not only taunts the other Acadec coaches but bets on the winning odds!  This portrayal is the exact opposite of who Mr. Minkoff was.  Although I was not on Acadec I was in one of Mr. Minkoff's classes and knew him as a wonderful teacher who would never stoop to such levels.  I also knew many of the students on Acadec and they were crushed to have lost and then when they were vilified in the local press as being sore losers when questions arose about Steinmetz's improbable scores it was a tough time for many of them.  Many do not realize that winning Acadec was a way to ensure scholarships for these students and these scholarships would have been wrongfully stripped from them despite their incredibly hard work to win the competition. Finally, the film attempts to insinuate that somehow the students of Whitney Young are complicit in a conspiracy with Acadec to win every year. One character even states that Whitney Young students probably cheated just like them but have not been caught because of its elite status.  This charge is disgusting and unfounded and really smears Mr. Minkoff (who passed away some years ago).  After this fraud Whitney Young went on to become the #2 national winners in the country which further validates that these kids really were the truly talented winners.  It must be said that to this day none of the Steinmetz students have expressed remorse about what they did.  The Steinmetz Acadec coach also never admitted any guilt or remorse until the film's release which was quite coincidental to say the least.

Another couple of things: The film makers went out of their way to portray as the privileged elite vs. hard-working working class.  The filmmakers did not request any insight or feedback from the students of Whitney Young, it Acadec team or its faculty.  Their information was gleaned from the Steinmetz students and Dr. Gerald Plecki the faculty advisor the Steinmetz Acadec team.

Now, about the film.  It is well-made and its protagonists are persuasive in their portrayal of the students.  Jeff Daniels plays Gerald Palecki very well, with just enough common man angst and sleaziness to make him a persuasive but creepy teacher.  With Daniels' portrayal you can see how persuasive a teacher can direct students looking for ""an out"" to collectively cheating.  As in real life the kids have been studying hard to qualify for the state Acadec competition.  They place but are 12,000 points behind the favored winners of the elite Whitney Young high school.  In the film WY is said to be a private school within the public school system with state of the (at the time) computers, a sleek modern facility on an open campus with students that appear to be straight out of a poster for model high school kids.  Steinmetz is shown from the beginning as having a ""poorer class"" of students.  The students are shown fighting, smoking, screaming, cursing and bored.  There is graffiti around and the neighborhood does not look particularly nice.  This in direct comparison to WY where the school is located on the near west side just near downtown Chicago and the students are dressed as preppy kids with what seems perpetual smiles on their faces.  Following their initial 5th place in the prelims which qualifies them to compete against WY and other schools at the state Acadec competition, the Steinmetz students are faced with a moral quandary.  One of the students procures an advance copy of the actual Acadec test.  Should they or shouldn't they use it to cheat and beat the smug WY team?  They decide to cheat and the story goes on from there.  It chronicles their win, the accusation of cheating, the media frenzy that erupts, the student's stubborn refusal to admit cheating and finally their downfall when a jealous team mate contacts the local newspaper to spill his guts and tell what happened.

The acting is well executed and the direction of the film is well-paced and the story is interesting.  The flaw of the film is in its handling of this dilemma.  According to this film because the ""system"" is stacked against the Steinmetz students their actions can be justified.  Why shouldn't they teach if the world thinks nothing of them anyway?  According to the film cheaters prosper more than the hard working joes of the world.  While this may be true to a certain extent I think this lets off the cheaters and the adult advisor.  The way the film portrays these kids it's as if there were no other circumstances under which they could have been recognized as successes other than cheating.  But this seems to go against the reality as portrayed in the film.  Case in point, when the Steinmetz kids finish in 5th place at the prelims to qualify for the state competition all of the students (but one) see this as an unqualified disaster.  I am not sure but, if this was their first time ever even qualifying at such a level why would this be a bad thing?  They finished 5th place in a competition with many other entrants including from schools considered more ""elite"" than Steinmetz.  This win directly defies the logic of the film that these kids were somehow huge underdogs that could never possibly compete in a system supposedly stacked against them.  Great acting and story telling but the logical leaps made in the film are too hard to swallow along with the shallow handling of the moral dilemma of cheating.  None of the students, the teacher (or it seems the film's writer/director) find fault with what they did (this is also true in real life).  The story ends with the main character portrayed by Jena Malone stating that she would do it all over again because she has learned how the world ""really' works.  Then on the radio a person calls in admitting to cheating all of his life but does not find this a moral issue.  He cheated in high school, college, and law school and is an unqualified success (he equates success with making $700K per year).  The film made a few parting concessions to the lack of morality such as when Dr. Palecki's mother states the obvious that nothing could make what he and the students did right no matter what they felt.  But this was undercut by so many other instances in the film where this is loudly disputed.",1252108800,4,8112,4.723525230987917

It is rated R, however if they hadn't used the little bit of words they used, it could have easily been a PG-13.

The story was there, it was good, and it moved quickly.

FYI~ In the last few minutes of the movie, there is a scene showing a classroom full of students.  The teacher sitting at his desk flipping through a magazine is the real Dr. Plecki that the story is about.",1250035200,,544,4.09433962264151
