7105650,5,B00VSHC4EE,American Dad keeps getting better !,1433289600,,35,5.0
7105651,5,B00VSHC4EE,Great set! Has some heartfelt episodes done American Dad style. Would buy again even with the MOD!,1433203200,,98,4.823529411764706
7105652,4,B00VSHC4EE,"I just got it today and only watched two episodes so far.  As mentioned in other posts the MOD disc art work is great, however a minor glitch in my set is the discs are numbered wrong.  I put in Disc One and after the disc loaded and went to the menu screen it comes up as Disc Two and the episodes listed are what is printed on the DVD case for Disc Two.  I thought I may have received two Disc Two's so I put in Disc Two to check it out and the menu screen comes up as Disc Three; do the same with Disc One and it comes up as Disc Two.  I got all three discs so I'm not going to return them.  I guess whoever burned the discs may have had a hangover that day and put them in the wrong order.",1433116800,,693,3.687074829931973
7105653,4,B00VSHC4EE,Not as funny as previous seasons...also no close captions,1432944000,2,57,5.444444444444445
7105654,4,B00VSHC4EE,"My second set of MOD DVDs. I'm not happy getting no extras, but at least I can buy the episodes. Still the 4 stars reflects this...and the fact that one disc holder was broken (plastic rattling around in the case before opening). Disc two had scratches on it, but it plays regardless...So, I'll keep it.",1432771200,2,303,4.527272727272727
7105655,1,B00VSHC4EE,This DVD set is crap! The bottom side of the discs are purple causing the disc forever to load and play. Once it does start every episode skips all the way through. I've not had a problem with any of the other seasons. This appears to be a manufacturing mistake. Seller was awesome and delivery was prompt.,1432598400,2,306,4.385964912280702
7105656,4,B00VSHC4EE,"A fine & fun collection of American Dad, with the latest episodes, uncensored.
Disc art (as mentioned elsewhere) is nice.
There are NO bonus features, & if there is an Easter Egg, I ain't found it.

Yet, I am happy. The Smiths are back.",1432598400,10,236,4.363636363636363
7105657,5,B00VSHC4EE,"Finally! The artwork on these MOD Discs look BEAUTIFUL (see photo) compared to every other MOD release I've ever bought from Amazon! Let's hope this trend continues! I'm not a fan of having to buy certain series I want or started collecting in MOD format now, but if they keep making them look like this, at least it lessens the blow! Keep it up!",1432080000,22,346,4.421875
7105658,2,B00VSHC4EE,"S1-9 Great, but Season 10 = Endless Gay Pedophilia & Gay Soft-Porn

Look, everyone knows Roger the Alien is gay, ok fine.  But season 10 is relentless, near every punchline or plot has some reference to man-on-man sex or man-on-boy sex.  Furthermore the writers berate America far beyond the typical seasons 1-9.

Examples:  (there are 100s of references and scenes, these are just a tiny fraction).

Episode 13Stans boss is obsessed with his first boy-boy experience.

Episode 14Stans boss and Stan talk about how they always wanted to hook-up

Episode 15Roger is giving Stans kid a sexual message.",1489708800,,599,5.040816326530612

Providing subtitles and/or captioning on home media releases has been adopted by most distribution companies. Not sure why Amazon feels it is necessary to produce a bootleg quality home media release and then ignore captioning and subtitle needs for people who enjoy this show. Really, amazon?

We figured we probably wouldn't be watching it again, so tried taking it to our local buy/sell/trade establishment. That's when we found out the copy we had purchased earlier in the year was a bootleg. We weren't terribly thrilled at this revelation, but I suppose that would explain why the dvd art was somewhat ghosty.",1473206400,,464,4.602409638554217

7105752,1,B00VSHC4EE,"Let me just begin this by saying I got this set as a gift, and I still feel ripped off.  The show is still funny, although the satire isn't as sharp as it was during the Bush administration.  The problem is the 'made on demand' DVD-R format that shows a complete lack of effort on the part of Fox.

Here's what you get:
- DVD-Rs with purple surface that proves these are little better than bootlegs
- LONG pauses in the middle of the dual layer DVD-R as your player switches between layers
- A single menu from which your only choice is what episode to watch, or to play all
- A cheap DVD case that will likely break, as mine did, leaving the center flap unhinged and likely to fall out and damage the discs or case even more
- No ability to easily skip opening credits as viewers had on earlier seasons
- No subtitles
- No deleted/extended scenes
- No commentary
- No special features of any kind

These really belong in the piles of DVDs at Big Lots, except at Big Lots it would only be about $8, and on actual DVDs (even if they were manufactured in Mexico).  I have no idea why this bargain-bin quality set is selling for nearly $30 on Amazon.  I think the people giving this rave reviews for how handsome the packaging and DVD's are must be Amazon/Fox employees.

Bottom Line:
For some reason the copy of Vol 9 I also received as a gift was on actual DVD's, even though the cover art looked like a cheap bootleg.  I was still disappointed with that, for similar reasons, but I let my enthusiasm for this show encourage me to request the next volume as a gift without looking into it.  I won't be fooled again.  I won't be paying more than $8 (if that) for this type of bare-bones set in the future, nor will I allow my family members to do so in buying it for me.

The show is still funny, and I still like it better than Family Guy, but it seems like Fox is giving it the shaft, and passing that along to us customers as well.",1452643200,17,1932,4.166666666666667

7105754,1,B00VSHC4EE,"This product is a collection of American Dad episodes created by Amazon. The case is a generic DVD case, with a poorly printed insert. The DVD-Rs that you receive contain the episodes, but the quality is sub-par. They look like someone recorded them. There is no normal home screen content, just a menu with the ability to select the episode you want.

This product is cheap and NOT a genuine product. I didn't notice that this was a cheap knockoff until I received the item, a basic DVD case and poorly printed insert, poorly shrinkwrapped to appear like a real, brand new, extra special item for people that don't know any better.

7105810,4,B00VSHC4EE,"The show is very much what it has been for a while.  The episode are, for the most part, self-contained stories, with the occasional throwback to a prior story.  Many of them revolve around Roger's and/or Steve's antics.  They continue with the inside jokes and jabs this season (there is a great line from Patrick Stewart about Star Trek in the Holodeck episode), and generally if you have liked the past few seasons and not become bored with the show, you will like this one.

The only drawback for those who get the discs, are they are again the made on demand DVD-R discs.  So you get no bonus features, no subtitles and no extras of any kind.  Given that it is one of the shows that Fox is no longer putting any effort into putting on DVD anymore, these are the best available.  Realistically most people will get the discs because they collected the prior seasons.  Otherwise, you are not missing anything if you stream it.",1438473600,12,929,4.520958083832335

8711109,3,B00VSHC4EE,"I have been having problems with V11 freezing on all three discs.  So I looked into making a personal backup and discovered something amazing!  V11's discs are purple, as is every brand/type of write-once DVD media that I've seen.  When I checked out V9, I found the discs are silver.  The same for V10.  Using the PC program ImgBurn, I looked at the specs for all three.  V11 is DVD+R-DL.  V9 and V10 are DVD_ROM.  I can only reason from this that V9 and V10 are pressed discs.  Maybe MOD sales were high enough that it was more financially prudent to run off some pressings.  Note that the content is exactly the same:  Simple menu; No subtitles, extras, commentary, etc.  I did make a backup of V11 to .ISO files on my PC using ImgBurn.  ImgBurn will NOT copy protected discs, so my V11 is not copy protected.  To the best of my knowledge, I am allowed to make one backup copy.  I am NOT allowed to circumvent copy protection to do so.  Since my V11 is not copy protected, there was nothing to circumvent.

  One content complaint that I've found.  V10's menu music is about 15db louder than the show audio.  I usually start the disc on mute and only turn it off when the show starts.  V9's menu and show audio (sadly stereo only) match, but are about the same level as V10's menu music.  V11's menu and show audio match, but are about the same level as V10's show audio.  You can tell they went out of their way to precision craft these discs. <BG>  I am not exaggerating about the sound.  I just metered all three discs' levels.  I set it so V9's menu music was showing around 0db.  Menu and show audio matched.  V10's menu music also is around 0db.  The show audio averages around -15db (quieter).  Both of V11's audios average around -15db.

  Note:  I have no affiliation with ImgBurn.  It's just the program I use.  Many other programs can report the type of disc and make backups.

  I gave it three stars because of no subtitles or extra features and the audio mismatch.",1514851200,2,1981,4.394444444444445
