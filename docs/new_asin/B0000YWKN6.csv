1960274,5,B0000YWKN6,"This anime is a very good one. The characters look like characters from Tenchi Muyo and that adds to the story. Its a bit more adult than tenchi muyo as there is nudity in the beginning. The innocence of the Photon makes the story interesting. At times you can tell that he has no idea what is really going on and then there are times, like when photon is fighting, that he seems to be so in control of things. The action that i have seen isn't corney and the comedy is very good. I have seen and own the english version and the dubbing is very good.",1095552000,4,550,4.101851851851852
1960275,5,B0000YWKN6,"A master piece, great characters,amazing backgrounds,an outstanding villan.  The strangness captures you.  Every night I pray to the anime gods that there will be more made.  This is definatly one to own!",1059868800,,204,5.3125
1960276,4,B0000YWKN6,"This is a very funny series.  The scenes in the spa where you just hear the woman talking is great.  It's a little over 3 hours long (6 episodes).  Although there is one major plot, there are several small ones throughout the series including stories about a ""holy object"" (very funny once you realize what it is), rock star, food, and even marriage.
The DVD-Rom features are also nice.  Not only do they have the full cast and credits, but several images from the series.  They even include the dialog for the series if you want to redub it.
There are a couple minor downsides, though.  First off, some of the technology is never fully explained.  The animation itself tapers very slightly as it progresses.  The big difference was the ""doodle"" (You'll learn a new word in japanese) that was on one characters forhead changed to just a couple of dots towards the end.  The ending is a little rushed and very confusing; I had to watch the last two episodes a couple times to understand it.
One important note I feel I should mention.  On the box it is labeled for 13 and up.  I really think this is too low.  There's nudity throughout the entire series and there are constant jokes about nudity and anatomy that really shouldn't be viewed by young children.  It is also very graphic (think nosebleed only 10 times worse)  Use your discretion.
This is one of those animes that you should get.  No collection should be without this.",1030752000,4,1430,4.552941176470588
1960277,3,B0000YWKN6,"Let me start off by saying the ending seemed rushed, and made little sense.  The emperor suddenly showing up, and the strange battle, as they tossed the words a-ho and una-ho around so much it made no sense what tehy were talkign abuot after a while.  But in teh end they get him.  It seemed like that series should have been longer, so the fight could make better sense.",1012089600,,371,4.3478260869565215
1960278,5,B0000YWKN6,"i saw this series in fansub format about 2 years ago... and loved it.  as soon as i found out that Central Park Media was going to release it, on DVD at that, i had to get it!  i have watched it about 5 times now and i still laugh at it.  but when i brought my girlfriend over to watch movies she picked this particular one out of all the rest.  she was a little... shocked at first (nudity i do believe) but then she was paying attention to what they was doing and saying to each other and she was laughing just as hard as i was.  this is a really great comedy anime, with the usual touch on risque subjects.
oh yea, the villan of the series, Poppachan, is so inept... he is just laughable.",1006646400,3,691,3.9782608695652173
1960279,1,B0000YWKN6,"That was pretty much what I said to myself throughout this series.  There seemed to be some kind of plot advances happening somewhere, but the viewer never gets clued in.  Characters act a certain way, and we don't know why.  No one seems to have any motivation to do the things they do.  And yes, I laughed.  But I laughed because I was so confused, I couldn't think of anything else to do.  This series makes no sense, and leaves the viewer with a profound sense of ""*blink?*  what just happened?  and WHY!?  WHY, GOD, WHY!?""",983750400,4,527,4.40625
1960280,5,B0000YWKN6,"Wow This show is awesome. don't even hesitate to buy it. If I could I would give it ten stars, not five. It's a story about how a young boy, and a rouge space pilot are mixed up with the conqueror, sir papacha nanadan.  This anime is so great in fact that not only do you wish there were more episodes , but you also wish that they would make a whole OAV devoted to the bad guy, since he is such a great and lovable character, and a whole twenty six episode tv series for Photon and his adventures.
  P.s.-I was watching anime for a year before I knew what an OAV(original animated video) was. It refers to the anime series which are released straight to video in japan, then,after they have made their money, some of the more succesful OAV's will be shown on japanese TV. Anime tv series are the opposite, going from Tv to video.  OAV's are also much shorter, and usually don't last more than 12 episodes, while a TV series can go on forever",976579200,10,942,4.216666666666667
1960281,5,B0000YWKN6,"I saw the entirety of Photon almost a year ago fansubbed, and I died laughing.  Every once in a while, an animation house needs time to let off steam after the more serious series, and Photon represents enough steam to melt the polar ice caps.  From AIC, the group behind Tenchi Muyo, El Hazard, and Dual, this series is so much more than a laugh a minute.  It is a bit short (only 6 episodes total), but considering you can now have it on one DVD, how could you pass that up?  Also, while extremely crack-addled for the most part, the ending has a moment of seriousness and is one of the best endings in anime, period.  If you love anime and bellylaughs, you owe it to yourself to buy this DVD yesterday!",972172800,10,705,4.2706766917293235
1960282,4,B0000YWKN6,"The series is quite short with only three hours total however, this is one of the funniest short series you'll ever seen. Photon has a lot of twists and turns especially during the last hour of the series. Overall, this series is a must see!",971049600,2,241,4.377777777777778
8004691,5,B0000YWKN6,"Brand new release. Maiden japan was gonna re-release this hot bubba, but the license was dropped. Luckily, it landed on Eastern Star Studios's watch and they have really rad customer service as well! Highly recommend this re-release. Buying this dvd is a piece of cake! On second thought, Brady Hartel and Reed Nelson are the only ones not part of the re-release. We want them back!",1513209600,,382,4.803030303030303

It is a short 6 episode story but packed with fun. It can get pricey obtaining this since it the DVD's aren't in production anymore but it is worth the money to get this one. Unfortunately the extras are web based and the site hosting them has been down for years.",1425081600,,355,4.220588235294118

8004697,5,B0000YWKN6,"Greetings;

My copy I bought from a blockbuster-one that had more recently been another video store and was one of the many previous rentals that was being sold off to make room for the new. No box art, just the disk, but it only ran me about $4.99. I knew about the series back then too, about 4 years ago and had checked it up on amazon then as I have now. As good as it is, I just can't see my way to paying $40-$120+ for six episodes, granting it was good, oh, but how it was. But in all seriousness, WTF? I hope that it is brought back, re-released. Something, maybe as a collection of some sort even would be great honestly.

All in all, a very awesome show, very funny, pretty hot at times too. Even better for me as I am a huge fan of Tenchi Muyo, as you may have noticed by now. Insanely so. Pretty similar in some ways, the concept of a marker pen being 'magic' in a way sort of reminds me of the Kurt Vonneget book 'Breakfast of Champions.' breaching the gap between the animated world and the real world that we live in. Awesome.

Thank you and take care...",1293580800,,1069,4.105263157894737
8004698,5,B0000YWKN6,"One of the most fun anime i've watched the ending gets a little serious but still a great ending.

I do have to say i actualy prefered it japanese language & subtitled, the english actors just dodn't convey some of the emotions that you get by listing to the japanese version.

Still a definate must for any anime lover!!",1258588800,,321,4.423728813559322
8004699,5,B0000YWKN6,"This movie is hilarious. The primary story is of a young boy who writes ""stupid"" on a woman's head. Too bad this woman is not from he same planet as he is and on her planet writing on someones head makes you their spouse! The movie contains cartoon nudity and some adult jokes, so keep the kids out if under the age of 13 or so. The animation quality is comparable to other top animations. The subtitles could have been a bit better, but overall they did a nice job with translations. If you are a fan of anime, this one is definitely worth it!",1218412800,,544,4.190476190476191
8004700,5,B0000YWKN6,"One of the most entertaining Animes out. It's story line is interesting and captivating from beginning to end. A must have for any older teen (Keep away from the Kids, this anime isn't for them)",1112572800,,194,4.571428571428571
