2886565,3,B000SINT4S,"Some very long and heart-felt reviews on Amazon testify to the strong psychological hold this show has on many viewers. I find their obvious identification with the characters in this series to be interesting, amusing, yet somewhat sad. Its cliche time: but a lot of viewers of this show seemingly need to get a life. The show does not stand up to all the analysis and projection by the viewers.  The show is very good only if you compare it to all the garbage that is on television. The actors who play Jim and Pam, and to a lesser degree Dwight, do a good job in their roles. Steve Carell just doesn't have it as the office manager. His acting is shallow, repetitious and you always know  he is ""acting.""  Actors playing ""over the top"" characters can succeed, but it is very difficult. Hugh Laurie, a superb actor, is able to make us believe in the ""over the top"" nasty, but genius doctor in House. I know I must seem condescending when I say that all the accolades given this series by viewers do not accurately  evaluate this series, but do validate the low standards and expectations that most television viewers have.",1187740800,7,1123,4.544554455445544
2886566,5,B000SINT4S,"It is pretty close to perfection the way The Office balances over-the-top hilarity, moments so awkward you have to watch them through your fingers, and poignant, subtle reflections of insecurity, inertia, regret and tenderness.  All of this is framed documentary style during a mundane day at the office or at an event of forced ""funtivities.""  It is bleak, and compelling, and tear-inducingly funny.  Attention to every tiny detail in direction, an amazing cast and unbelievably great writing make this the best comedy on television right now.",1186617600,3,544,5.3023255813953485
2886567,5,B000SINT4S,"I usually do not post many comments, but wanted to discuss how the character of Ryan is very interesting.  At first glance, you almost feel sorry for him being the office temp and the subject of Michael's harrassment, business school on the side, etc.  Go back and watch the shows again (focus on Ryan, I know, it's hard to concentrate on any character since the show is busy....); he is not that nice (not giving Jim his desk upon return, asking about former girlfriends,the scathing review of Dunder Miflin management at the business school lecture, etc) and you get the sense that he is biding his time, waiting to get ahead.  The last ten seconds of the season three finale show gave the writers a fantastic position to explore next season (not just about how Kelly will handle it).  Ryan is cold, and it will be a shock to the Pam and Jim followers of the show.  Just another reason to watch this multi-facet show.  IMHO, the show will get dark and reveal a different angle of business at Dunder-Mifflin.  The relationship between the corporate office and the local Scranton branch may become strained (especially if Michael think he taught Ryan everything to be successful!).  I wonder if Ryan will still have the hots for Karen??
The meltdown of Jan could be seen from Jupiter (you just knew her behavior was in decay), the rise of Ryan was not expected!
I love this show since the characters are so enjoyable.  You can see certain traits of people in your own environment.  I've never had a boss as clueless as Michael Scott, but his twisted loyalty to his troops is undeniable.
Post some comments, I'd love to know what other think.  At first I thought this show could not last for two years.  Now I'm starting to think five to seven could be realistic.  The whole ""mock-u-mentory"" style allows the audience to almost participate in the conversations, but to really observe.  You can also see the reactions of many charatcters at once by looking around the room.  They are almost always different and that contrasting style is what really makes this show work.
Just a quick update, I just watched the ""what happened over the summer"" trailer and it was hilarious!  All of snips were great.  Ryan is such a punk with that ""so-cool"" facial hair shadow and Kelly's critique was so much more than a scorned woman wishing her former lover well!  What was up with Karen's top........",1185321600,41,2385,4.6650717703349285
2886568,5,B000SINT4S,"This is a show that I didn't catch on to until I watched the first season on DVD in one sitting.  I watched the second season on TV, but I had to have the second season on DVD too, and when that came in, I sat down and watched the whole thing in one sitting.  Every season gets better and better.  This third season was great, I sat down every Thursday to watch and was never let down.

Other reviews cover in great depth the many story lines and characters, so I'll keep it short with a review of the features on the DVD.  Cast and crew commentaries and deleted scenes are fantastic as they were in the previous DVD sets.  There seem to be more of the cast participating in the commentaries than there was in Season 2, including John Krasinski who I remember being absent from the Season 2 commentaries.

Overall, a must have!  If you enjoyed watching a few episodes on TV, I'd go so far as to recommend you'd enjoy Seasons 1 & 2 and invest in all 3 seasons so you can watch everything develop in the way it was intended.

I'll leave you with my favorite season 3 quote: ""When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins. When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus. Do I regret this? No, I believe his tissue has made me stronger. I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby."" - Dwight Schrute, Season 3",1185148800,,1421,4.214022140221402

2886571,5,B000SINT4S,"Warning!  There are spoilers in the following review.

Briefly, the history of my response to the NBC version of THE OFFICE is as follows:  before it started horror that they were remaking a the BBC masterpiece, then surprise in Season One (at least after the first horrid episode, which I think all of us OFFICE fans would like to forget) that it was not only not horrid but actually pretty good, and then delight in Season Two as it got better and better.  Starting Season Three I was fearful, afraid that it was not going to be able to keep the show on the level of genius that it had maintained through the previous season.  But once again my expectations and fears were confounded.  It easily stayed as fresh and as brilliant as it had been in Season Three.

In terms of format I find THE OFFICE to be one of the most interesting shows on TV.  For the past twenty years most shows--well, at least almost all good ones--have struggled with a balance between standalone episodes (or the episodic format strictly speaking) and serial arcs.  THE X-FILES, one of the most important shows in the development of the modern story arc, alternated between rigidly standalone episodes and what they termed their ""mythology"" episodes.  But most shows have more and more come to adopt a hybrid format in which they will have episode elements while at the same time gradually moving forward their arcs.  THE OFFICE in most ways is an episode series, in that for most of the characters everything restarts each week and they are not really part of an evolving story.  For the most part THE OFFICE has maintained arcs built around office romances, most importantly Pam and Jim but also Michael and Jan, with Dwight and Angela as well as Ryan and Kelly in the background.  But they managed to work in a couple of other arcs in Season Three as well, most notably Andy's attempt to rebuild the structures of power in the office.  But nonetheless, the overwhelming ongoing story in THE OFFICE is that of Pam and Jim.

Season Two ended with Pam and Jim kissing during casino night.  In Season Three we learn that Jim transferred to the Stamford office of Dunder-Mifflin in order to distance himself from Pam, who ultimately rejected his overtures.  Ironically, shortly after Jim left she broke off her engagement to Roy.  Most of Season Three deals with Pam and Jim's ongoing and largely unresolved feelings about each other.  Things are complicated when in Stamford Jim begins dating the lovely and eventually likable Karen (played by the lovely Rashida Jones), which means he is unavailable to see Pam when he returns to Scranton when the Stamford office is closed.  Of course we all want Jim and Pam together, but we like Karen also.  The resulting situation is therefore somewhat the reverse of Season Two, when Jim spent the season pining over Pam.  This year Pam pines over Jim, but with one major difference.  While in Season Two Jim and Pam were best friends despite how Jim felt about Pam, in Season Three things are strained between them.  Pam, in fact, is quite alone most of the season.

One definitely senses that Jim and Pam are finally on the verge of getting together in Season Four.  Looking ahead for just a second, one wonders if the writers will truly allow this to happen.  One truism in contemporary TV writing is that you can never let the main romantic couple on a show get together for long.  This is known as the David and Maddie Problem, named for the lead couple in MOONLIGHTING.  As soon as Bruce Willis's David and Cybil Shepherd's Maddie made love, interest in the show disintegrated (though personally I think the irregular appearance of new episodes was as much to blame) and it gradually came to an end.  (This is also sometimes called the Lois and Clark Problem, since THE ADVENTURES OF LOIS AND CLARK saw a sharp decline in ratings as soon as the two of them became involved.)  Since then writers and producers have been terrified of getting couples together.  Generally when two people get together you can guess that something catastrophic is about to happen.  So, will Pam and Jim try to make a go of it in Season Four?  Will the writers attempt to overcome the jinx of David and Maddie?  Just one of the mysteries to be solved in Season Three.

I cannot express how much I love this cast.  I must confess that I side with a number of leading TV critics (like TV Guide's Matt Roush) in confessing that I'm not a huge fan of either Steve Carrell's Michael Scott or Rainn Wilson's Dwight Schrute.  I know they are hugely popular with many fans, but I find both of them a tad too hard to believe in.  I prefer the rest of the cast, which has expanded in importance over the course of the past two seasons.  I love the way we have been able to get to know all the regulars in the office, not merely Pam and Jim, but Ryan, Kelly, Phyllis, Kevin, Meredith, Toby, Angela, Oscar, Stanley, and Darryl.  And for the record, I don't always find Michael unentertaining.  It is merely that at times he does things that make me so uncomfortable that I squirm.  And Dwight is sometimes funny, though far too often he becomes so extreme that he passes over being funny to something else.  I find Dwight to be at his best when he is trying to help others instead of reacting to his own all embracing set of fears.

I will confess gratitude to Dwight's frequent and sometimes wonderful shout outs to my favorite show on TV, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.  One interesting aspect to television in the 2006-2007 season was the sheer number of references in various series to BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, which some observers has speculated may be the most avidly viewed series by TV and movie industry outsiders than any other (THE OFFICE might well be second; BSG creative genius Ron Moore confesses to be a huge fan).  THE GILMORE GIRLS, HEROES, VERONICA MARS, SOUTH PARK, THE O.C., and several other series all made nods towards BSG, but no show more frequently than THE OFFICE.  And Dwight may have had the best BSG line in any of the aforementioned shows in an episode when he confronted a somewhat older and very conservative looking gentleman at a Dunder-Mifflin part and asked him, ""Do you watch BATTLESTAR GALACTICA?""  ""No.""  ""You sir, are an idiot.""

Like the previous season, Season Three provided us with a host of unforgettable moments.  So many of them are hard to summarize because they are caught in a glance or a look, especially by Pam or Jim.  Some highlights include Michael's insistence at giving Oscar a kiss after learning he was gay.  Or Dwight's sly smile when Michael, speculating on the sexual preference of some of the office employees, asks Dwight, ""What about Angela?  I can imagine her with a woman.  Can't you?""  Or Kelly sprinting into Victoria's Secret after Michael offers to buy all of the women into the office a single item from their stock.  Or Michael being the only person from the office to show up at an art showing by Pam and his buying one of her paintings for the office.  Or Michael contemplating jumping off the top of the building onto a balloon that would certainly not keep him from dying.  Or Pam running across hot coals and then confronting Jim over ceasing to be her friend.  I'm sure that every fan has his or her own set of memories.

This was also the season when the show had a number of celebrity directors.  Harold Ramis directed several episodes.  J. J. Abrams directed one.  And Joss Whedon, the creator of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, directed ""Business School,"" in which Jim pretends to have been bitten by a bat that caught trapped inside the office.  Jim proceeds to distress Dwight into thinking that he might have been turned into a vampire, first rubbing a tooth as if it might be on the verge of growing into a fang and later complaining of how bright the light is.  Hopefully Season Four will bring additional well-known guest directors.

THE OFFICE proved so popular in Season Three that NBC briefly suggested that the show expand to an hour each week.  Every fan I talked to reacted to horror at this.  If we could be assured that the show would be a brilliant and as funny for an hour each week, then I'm sure everyone would be delighted with the prospect, but the fear is that the show would become diluted and there would be a watering down of ideas and humor.  Luckily NBC backed off the request, though it was agreed that there will be four hour-long episodes in Season Four.

Lastly, hopefully Jenna Fischer will be recovered from a terrible accident that she had this summer in New York during the Upfront Presentation.  According to what I have read, she slipped on a marble staircase and hit her back hard against the steps.  Luckily, although she broke several bones in her back she did not sustain any nerve damage.  Her recovery will evidently overlap with the beginning of shooting for the new season.  I'm hopeful that she will be feeling well enough to not miss any episodes or more importantly to be in any ongoing pain.",1183680000,74,8994,4.616498740554156

The Pam/Jim sub-plot comes to an interesting resolution, although the bizarre Michael Scott plot involving his relationship with Jan is troubling more than it is funny. I understand dark elements in comedy but that particular relationship just has an uncomfortable, almost sinister vibe to it. The story arch involving blending the offices was amusing, but you sort of figured out that it was just going to be a gradual elimination of most all of the new people as the series progressed, and so it was.
As with the first few seasons, the things Michael gets away with are just so patently ridiculous you really have to suspend disbelief that he hasn't lost his job by this point, but I guess that's just the main gag of this series.",1489449600,,789,4.683453237410072

2886601,5,B000SINT4S,"I think season two is probably the best season of The Office, quality wise, but season three is my favorite and I rewatch it whenever I am sad or bored or having a bad day. Sometimes, going about my life, I just think of one of the lines or jokes from this show and I have to stop what I'm doing and go hang out with these people for half an hour. This show is so heartfelt and genuine. I think if you haven't seen it, you are missing out on a great life experience. I adore TV, though, so I'm kind of biased. Season one had a lot of that British black humor heldover from the original show it's based on and season two had a little. It would sometimes slip into an awkward or cringe-worthy or sad place. Season three has not as much. It's more American mainstream comedy, not too many sad episodes except the stuff with Jim and Pam being estranged but clearly still in love. ""Gay Witch Hunt,"" the season opener, makes me laugh until my stomach hurts and I can't breathe or even hear what they are saying anymore. ""Initiatiom,"" episode five, is one of my favorite Office episodes of all time. ""Benihana Christmas"" I love to watch almost every Christmas. It is so solid- so much humor and feeling. ""Safety Training"" is actually a little sad and just a great episode for people who love Michael Scott. He is an amazing character. He is so, so complex- and underappreciated for that. Steve Carell deserves awards for the subtlety he brings to that role. ""Beach Day"" I adore. It is a fantastic Pam episode. Her character can come off self-righteous or passive, but she owns herself in this episode and it was a long time coming. ""The Job"" makes me tear up every time, when Jim walks into the conference room and interrupts Pam and she looks back at the camera and her eyes are watery but she's smiling so wide and she says, ""What was the question?"" This is the last great season. Season four is up and down, so is season five, and after that it's like scattered brilliance in my opinion. But this season is solid as anything.

2886627,5,B000SINT4S,"The Office is easily one of my favorite shows of all time. I have this weird problem with most sitcoms: I don't find most of them especially funny. The Office, though, totally works for my (admittedly sarcastic and slightly warped!) sense of humor. The jokes derive primarily from the characters' relatable flaws and from uncomfortably hilarious truths. Most of the wit is so dry and clever that you may need a couple of viewings to fully catch all the one liners, but there's some joyfully silly stuff here as well.  The show is more than just funny, though: I find it incredibly poignant, insightful, smart and unexpectedly sweet.

The first four seasons are all among my favorite seasons of any show ever, but this third season has emerged as my special favorite. As others have noted, while the six-episode Season 1 and the full-length Season 2 primarily focused on Jim's yearning to be with the engaged-to-the-wrong-guy Pam, Season 3 is about Pam growing into someone confident and courageous enough to finally confront her feelings for Jim. Pam Beesly isn't the more typical tough, hyper-competent, sassy and virtually invulnerable female character you see more often on TV these days. She's a little harder to admire, but (for me!) a lot more human, and therefore easier to love and root for. While sweet, sensitive, quietly insightful and witty, Pam is horribly unassertive, fearful of change and hopelessly out of touch with her own feelings. Watching her evolve into a slightly more secure and candid character while still retaining her quintessential Pam-ness makes this season especially gratifying for me.

Rest assured, though, that this season has more to offer than just the awkward and ultimately heartwarming relationship-related stuff about Jim and Pam! We get the usual amusing skewering of typical corporate office ridiculousness, learn more about the show's awesomely quirky minor characters while meeting a few new ones, and get to see the incomparable Michael Scott continue to be both hilariously clueless and insensitive while still showing surprising bursts of generosity and humanity. Any guesses on how Michael Scott reacts to learning that someone in the office is (gasp) gay? How about discovering that one of his employees is convicted criminal? Yes, he reacts with even more cringe-inducing ridiculousness than you might imagine, and it's incredibly clever and amusing :)

Some call the Office too ""dark"", but even as someone who doesn't generally care for darker and edgier programming, I love this show beyond the telling of it. The slightly darker aspects of it are so perfectly balanced out by well-earned moments of warmth and happiness.

I'm not usually too concerned with a DVDs extra (or lack thereof!) either way, but it's worth noting that the deleted scenes and gag reel on this set are among the most awesome I've ever seen. I can't recommend this purchase highly enough!",1413072000,,2916,5.117647058823529

2886642,1,B000SINT4S,"First of all, I love the office.  I am bombing the review for this Season-3 set of DVDs.  The Boxed set is comprised of four separate DVD jewel cases that look like the type of DVDs you'd pick-up in the $1.99 bin at your local drug store.

When I buy a DVD, I rip an archival copy and store it to my NAS for streaming to my media devices.  The track layout on these DVD's is the worst I've ever seen.  While I'm sure this DVD would possibly play fine in a player, getting data off the DVD to network storage was a horrendous effort.  The discs are clogged with redundant episodes, no clear labeling, and other crap and filler I didn't have time to explore.

For example, on disc 3 - there are six episodes totaling appx 160 mins (2 h 40m) of video.  My ripper located six episodes that are around 42 minutes in length, but three of these are the same episode (#12).

Then there's the 9 ""other"" tracks on the disc, of about 21 minutes with all but one episode - which is repeated on two tracks of 17 minutes of the same 50-minute episode (#12).

Confused yet?

Just find another box-set for season-3 and buy that one....you'll be much, much happier with the product quality.",1399420800,,1173,4.286363636363636

2886660,5,B000SINT4S,"I have been a huge fan of THE OFFICE ever since its first season. And, up to and including the very last episode, I am glad I did. The Series was original in its premise and execution, the pseudo-documentary format opening up numerous previously little explored avenues of storytelling. And it was great fun to watch.

The setting (the office of a small branch of paper-selling company) and the stories (everyday life of the people found working in such a low-prospects jobs) seem mundane at first. And there lies the magic of the creators. For (if the endless strings of CSIs are any indication) it not hard to create good TV with car chases, gadgets and explosions. It is extremely hard to make excellent TV with only the everyday grind to work with. It seems effortless only because they made it look easy.

The brief one-way interviews each character had with the camera functioned as either prefatory summaries of stories about to unfold (building up the anticipation) or as instances of pushing back, yet never breaking, the forth wall, and, thus, making the viewing experience more personal and involving. All without the show ever loosing its step.

Producing, directing and writing will only get you so far without the right cast. And THE OFFICE enjoyed such stellar cast. Steve Carell may have risked getting typecast by creating the unforgettable character of Michael Scott but it was worth it. Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) served first as the precarious love interest and then as the familiar friends you care about and the rest of the cast was one successful pick after another. From hypochondriac and hypercritical (not to mention hypocritical) Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) to perky Kelly Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), I could not imagine anyone else portraying these memorable characters. However, the show stealer has always been obsessive nerd Dwight Schrute, portrayed to perfection by Rainn Wilson.

Purists and snobs will try to argue that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-precursor-British-Series/dp/B0002W4P98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the precursor British Series</a>&nbsp;was better. Strangely for someone who usually finds Hollywood remakes watered down and bland, in this case I strongly disagree. The US version was much better. It had the perfect mix of familiar workday desperation and sweet quirkiness to make it a weekly craved addiction. In contrast, I found the BBC version too mean for my taste. Maybe one should have grown up in a cruel class system carved out by accent hues and prep-school rankings to appreciate it; however, during the handful of  episodes I managed to watch I found myself laughing at the characters, not with them, and then felt bad about it. Anyway, in all honesty, how could Gareth ever compare to Dwight!

The series is unique in another aspect as well: it respected its viewers. Every producer, director and writer wants to make his or hers memorable splash so we often end up with unnecessary cliffhangers, ambiguous endings or unsatisfying closures. Not so with THE OFFICE. No spoilers but I will just state that the show does not disappoint to the very end.

Now, how many reams of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dunder-Mifflin-Premium-acid-free-paper/dp/B006CDW35O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dunder Mifflin Premium acid-free paper</a>&nbsp;should I you down for?",1372550400,,3433,5.527619047619048

2886667,5,B000SINT4S,"""The Office"" quickly established itself as one of the funniest comedies on television, capturing the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series after its second season.  Season Three ran on NBC from September 2006 to May 2007, and this DVD set contains that season in its entirety.

The mockumentary looks at life at the Dunder Mifflin paper company in Scranton--Steve Carell plays Michael Scott, the hilariously clueless regional manager of the company's Scranton branch, and Rainn Wilson stars as Dwight Schrute, his zany assistant.  The American version of ""The Office"" also works in more good, funny characters than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/its-British-counterpart/dp/B0002W4P98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">its British counterpart</a>&nbsp;manages to do.

Amidst all of the awkward moments, jockeying for position, pranks, and romances in these episodes, one of the biggest happenings of the third season was the closure of the Stamford branch of the company, resulting in two more regular characters in the Scranton branch.  An especially funny episode was ""The Convict,"" in which Michael plays Prison Mike.

I can not believe I hesitate watching this show for so long because I thought it was going to be like ""Office Space"" which in my opinion was extremely boring. This is the best comedy show since ""Arrested Development"" there I said it! If you work in a cubicle, hell even if you don't work in one, there is no way you can not find this show funny. It's very rare where a show can keep me laughing days after I seen the episode. Unlike many sitcoms where jokes are written for the quick laugh and can be funny regardless of who said it. The Office builds the laughs around its characters and settings, and certain jokes only become funny when they are put into the context of what went on. Something I haven't seen since ""Arrested Development"" aired. Steve Carell is a genius by creating a character so stupid, rude, ignorant, yet fondly to the audience. The Pam and Jim relationship is so intensely cute that I can't help but smile idiotically at every glance the characters give to each other. Dwight fully develops as a character and its funny as ever. My suggestion, watch every episode in order from the beginning you won't regret it.

I went out and got Season 2 and 3 (I still have to see Season 1, 4, and subs) so I could enjoy the show in order.  Each and every character is so well-drawn.  Having spent my entire working life in an office (I'm 53 now), the premise of this show is near and dear to my heart.  There are so many great stories that we all have of office life, and this show is like a whirlwind of laughter and fun and rings so true.  Michael and Jan are amazingly good, Dwight, Angela, Toby, the guys in the warehouse, its just a ball to observe and laugh with and at them.  And Jim and Pam are priceless.  Office attractions, now that some of us are old enough to look back on them, are an amazing part of life.  The very end of Season 2 was just electric, and to see Pam's beautiful face at the very end of Season 3's last show is just transcendent.  She is, without question, portrayed so well by Jenna Fischer, and John Krasinski is equally good as Jim, that I feel a part of their world.

2886695,5,B000SINT4S,"This season of the office is probably the funniest and most creative season which I have seen. I do enjoy all of the seasons, but this season in particular seems to be the one that all of the characters most enjoy playing their roles. There is something to be said for the ability to come up with ridiculous, yet funny scenarios right on the spot. I say this because while watching the extras, it seemed that the characters had quite a bit of freedom to take the conversation where they wanted it to go. Some other details about the show which greatly add to its interest and creativity are the camera angles, facial expressions, interpersonal conflicts within the office, and Michael's complete inability, despite valiant efforts, to treat a ""politically incorrect"" topic with respect. I usually find myself saying...""He can not really be saying/doing that, can he?"" And that is why I find it funny.
 Who ever came up with the idea to interview each one of the office members individually really had a good idea. It appeals to people's desire to know what's ""really going on"" and helps you to better understand why certain characters act the way they do in their day to day activities. I think I would be much more confused as to what was going on and the sense of humor would not be as funny if they didn't explain some things before hand in the ""one on one interviews.""
 Every single one of the characters in the office makes very unique facial expressions. I don't know that the show would be even half as funny as it is without the facial expressions. Some scenes seem to consist of nothing but facial expressions and they really do say it all.
 I love the relationships within the office which seem to make no sense whatsoever. Who would have thought that Toby would be the most disdained employee in the office? What are Angela and Dwight all about? And why in the world do Dwight and Andy fight like small children to earn Michael's affection? Why do Jim and Pam deny the fact that they obviously love spending time together, and should probably just get together? None of it makes much sense, but it is quite entertaining to watch.
 Michael is probably the best example of political incorrectness that there is. It is funny how he not only butchers the topics that they discuss, but he also displays a bit of how tricky it becomes when we have to tip toe around so many topics in the work place these days. He says some things that many of us quietly wonder to ourselves at times, but that we know are just not ok to ask out loud, especially in a meeting at work. Even though Michael is completely outlandish and uncensored, there is still a soft heart behind his actions, which allows him to still be a likeable character.
 Even though The Office is a clean show over all, it still does incorporate many suggestive comments and scenarios. Although this is not uncommon today in our culture's media, I do believe it is still regrettable, and the show could be just as humorous without adding innuendos.
 I don't know that many people fifty years ago would understand this show at all, or appreciate it for that matter. Overall, The Office is a comical depiction of contemporary American culture, uncensored. The relationships within the office exemplify true to life scenarios including competition, deception, romance, and many others. I would recommend this season to anyone who is looking to kill a few brain cells and for a good laugh.",1265241600,,3448,4.644262295081967

2886714,5,B000SINT4S,"The US series continues in full force, perhaps even increasing in comedic brilliance, as it develops both lead and supporting characters to the point where we, the die-hard audience, know them like our kin.

Hilarious new character Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), a passive-aggressive sociopath transferred from the Stanford branch, makes many memorable appearances, several of these being personality clashes with Dwight (Rainn Wilson). As with Dwight, audience heroes Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) subject Andy to a variety of outlandish pranks.

Dwight himself ups the comedic ante almost tenfold; indeed, it is this series that made Rainn Wilson a superstar. A particular highlight is episode three, where Dwight and boss Michael (the mesmerizing cast lead Steve Carell) have an unforgettable run-in over Michael's job.

The budding romance between Michael and his boss Jan (the gorgeous Melora Hardin) begins in earnest, helped by the fact that Jan is sinking further into a nervous breakdown. Other office romances either run their course or are given a fresh perspective by the series' end.

While it's the first half of the series, up to the episode featuring Phyllis's wedding, where the comedy is truly cerebral and almost dazzling in its hilarity, the remainder is still very funny. At any price below US$40.00, this DVD is a bargain, especially since there are so many deleted scenes on each of the four discs. You can play these scenes back-to-back and create new pseudo-episodes that run for almost an hour per disc. And these aren't your average deleted scenes - for those who appreciate the blackest of black comedy, they are even better than the scenes that made the final cut.

2886717,4,B000SINT4S,"The Office, at it's best, is a complex, well-written, and subtle ensemble comedy with a bit of drama thrown in. Season 3, while not quite as consistent as Season 2, still manages to create some of the best individual episodes yet. My main qualm is the meddling by the powers that be with two of the best episodes in series history: ""Traveling Salesmen"" and ""The Return."" These episodes occur one after another, continue various plot threads seamlessly, and are incredibly well-written and clever. iTunes even released an extended, 28-minute cut of ""The Return,"" which was better than the original. I naturally expected it to appear on this set. However, instead of showcasing the two best episodes of the season, the corporate decision-makers condensed and merged them together, creating a single episode (called ""Traveling Salemen/The Return) which not only doesn't have the extended cut material, but also has scenes removed from the original cut, including the hilarious cold open from ""Traveling Salesmen."" To me, this is a mind-boggling decision: instead of giving two great episodes some breathing room, they've had them shortened and squished together. My question is this: why use a DVD to give Office fans less instead of more? The butchering of ""Traveling Salesmen"" and ""The Return"" alone has led me to side with iTunes and make a move for a video ipod--it's the only way I can watch the best episodes from this season!

I used to LIKE Pam.  She was so endearing.  Then, after Pam blows Jim off twice when Jim works up the courage to tell her his true feelings on her wedding day (for the sake of suspending the plot, no doubt), after three years of reticence on her part, when it would have taken no courage to tell HIM her feelings, since he was the single one; after blowing him off TWICE, she breaks up with Roy, then Jim returns happy with Karen (carbon copy of Pam, personality-wise), Pam gets back together with Roy, then a few days later dumps Roy, then finally sabotages Jim's happy relationship with Karen.  Pam turned out to be a bitch, and whichever screenwriter did that should be fired.

So Pam is either more erratic than Jan (who, btw, was in this season embarrassingly unstable and clingy and unprofessional...did some writer mix up the characters?).  Or Pam is just as mature as a 15 year old school girl.  She turns Jim away when he opens up and makes himself vulnerable beneath the stars at night; THEN she sabotages his relationship with Karen and his promotion, just because she can (or because, again, she's actually a 15 year old schoolgirl who can't stand to see a guy she's attracted to be happy with another girl).",1221523200,3,1361,4.545081967213115

2886724,5,B000SINT4S,"I was slow to catch on to The Office after season one, but then, Season 2 captured me entirely. The moment I finished watching the last episode of Season 2, I ran out and bought the third season. And I had to drive to another town to get it, and I was almost entirely broke. But I had to see it, and of course, it was all worth it.

The same things I admired so much about Season 2 I admire here. The Office is just about the only sitcom I can think of that has created such a meaningful and coherent storyline over several seasons. The Pam and Jim story is what drives this show, and the writers, producers, actors, and everyone else have outdone themselves in developing that story logically and meaningfully. The intrusion of Karen into that story has flipped things in a way that have allowed Pam and Jim to grow and learn to see their hearts. Really, this is a show that has more heart to it than any other currently on television.

The final two episodes of the season, especially, are wonderful. I can't tell you how many times I've watched Pam's speech at the end of ""Beach Games."" What a scene!

Of course, everything else is wonderful, too. Dwight has been brought along nicely, and the Michael and Jan relationship provides tons of laughs. I think that the writers made a smart move creating Andy. Dwight's become a little too likeable to be quite the goofy antagonist he was in the first couple of seasons. Andy handles some of that load well. The funniest moment of the whole series, in my opinion, is at the end of ""Cocktails"" when Andy reappears. I called about three people (who'd already seen the show) to talk about it afterward.

I also enjoyed a bit of the break in the monotony...I mean I love the Scranton branch, but only so much can happen, this brought in some new storylines to liven things up and keep the show fresh for viewers.

If you like The Office, I recommend buying a DVD, like I said, it's great to flip it on to a favorite episode when you're bored or bummed out.  Laughter is the best medicine, and how many shows out there lately can make you laugh out loud??  If you haven't watched the show yet- I recommend starting with Season 2, Season 1 was a bit slow...so you may want to skip to the good stuff.

Cheers to the cast and writers of this show, keep up the great work!!",1215648000,,1148,4.084821428571429

2886745,5,B000SINT4S,"Another great season of ""The Office"", though initially I experienced some trepidation when discovering, upon watching the first episode in this set, that the perfect little snowglobe/microcosm of comic perfection that was season two of ""The Office"" had apparently been scattered to the winds. You see, there was just something so, well... perfect about that small group of characters permanantly on display in that small office set, playing off one another.  Here- horrors!- we start off with Jim up in Connecticut interacting with a bunch of strangers, with the comic dynamic back in Scranton not having the same familiar flavor due to that change.  Ah, but it soon becomes clear that there is a method to the creators' and writers' madness.  Amid the funny stories (happily, just as weird and entertaining as usual), we slowly get to know and enjoy Jim's new colleagues, watch with interest as Jim's office slowly merges with the Scranton office, and watch with even more interest as the Jim/Pam dynamic slowly picks up again.  In other words, by stirring the pot a little and throwing some new seasonings into the mix, we still get the show we know and love but with a new freshness and a complete lack of repetitiveness.

Also enjoyable is that the character of Michael is allowed to further grow, with new complexities being added to the first glimmers of complexity seen in season two.  Happily, Michael is still given his moments of cluelessness (usually when he's talking about women), but it's fun to see him get one up on Dwight and new office buffoon Andy on occasion.  And it's also nice to see Pam and the other women in the office side with Michael when they feel he's being mistreated by Jan.  Good stuff, and- again- a nice combination of familiar and fresh.

The special features on these discs remain quite agreeable, too, especially the deleted scenes attached to most of the episodes.  Each deleted scenes segment runs from a few minutes to almost the length of an entire regular show, with each segment feeling like a polished, parallel, (as just as funny) version of the episode you just watched, letting you see the many hilarious scenes that happened in between the scenes of the ""official"" episode.  Don't miss 'em!

And now for the long wait for season four of ""The Office"" on DVD.  Sigh, I really should just start to watch these things on regular TV, commercials or not.

2886752,5,B000SINT4S,"At the risk of simply following the crowd of reviews, I think the third season on the Office is when the show managed to break away from the UK version and become a fantastic show in it's own right. The shows in this season grow in the entertainment value until the season finale. But you can read that in the other reviews, what about that DVD's themselves? Commentaries are to be found on most of the favourite episodes, and they are  entertaining without being indulgent from both the actors and writers (sometimes, the people are both). The DVD's are worth getting simply for the  deleted scenes themselves. Over three hours are to be found, most of which was simply removed for time and are as funny as anything else to be found in the episodes themselves. I still haven't managed to get through all of the features, but highly recommended is the clip from the 2006 Emmy's. To say to much would be to ruin it for those who haven't seen it, but when i first saw it i couldn't contain my laughter.

2886755,3,B000SINT4S,"**SPOILERS**
I know this review won't be popular, but I was very disappointed with Season 3 of ""The Office"". Other than seeing parts of a few episodes, I missed the show entirely on television and one day borrowed the season 1-3 DVDs from a friend. Over the course of several weeks I watched all the episodes sequentially, and this allowed me to get a feel for how the show was evolving over time. Season 1 was very good, but I got the sense that they were still finding their rhythm. Season 2, however, was fantastic. It had excellent writing and direction, the performers revealed just how well they had been cast in their parts, and they really made you care about the relationships between their characters. I was obviously excited to begin season 3, but was sad to discover half way through disc 1 that much of the magic from season 2 was gone. Michael Scott, who used to induce cringes of discomfort with his ignorant and inappropriate remarks, had been reduced to a mere buffoon who no one took seriously. The Pam-Jim-Karen love triangle fizzled and failed to build on the emotional finish of season 2. The idea that Jan would have any sustained interest in a relationship with Michael was completely unbelievable. Ryan, amusing as the wet-behind-the-ears temp who represented the detached viewers, became merely annoying after B.J. Novak increased his own role in the show. And don't get me started on the pointless expansion of the 'Kelly' character or John Krasinski's silly wig he wears during the last part of the season. Make no mistake - there are still some classic episodes in season 3 such as ""Gay Witch Hunt"" ""Phyllis' Wedding"" and ""Business School"" but there are way too many duds like ""Initiation"" ""Safety Training"" ""Diwali"" and ""The Convict"" ('Prison Mike' demonstrates how the Michael Scott character devolved from being a misguided but well-meaning dork to a borderline retarded moron). I also wish Ed Helms' role had been better utilized. There was so much potential to create hilarious office dynamics with Andy but they waste it for the most part. I haven't watched any of season 4, but I hear it is more of a return to form. There is a lot to like in season 3, but the humor misses more than hits and that is nothing but a disappointment for a show with as much potential as ""The Office"".",1205625600,3,2315,4.718518518518518

2886770,5,B000SINT4S,"This is by far one of the most clever and creative shows on television.  It delights in taking a politically incorrect stance about just about everything and, in so doing, shows how susceptible we all are to stereotypes and prejudice.  To say that this show is a sendup of corporate culture is really only discussing one aspect of the show.  It is a complex and colorful story whose characters continue to grow and to shock and amaze the viewer.  It also happens to be one of the funniest shows I have ever had the pleasure of viewing.

This season is a standout because of the continuing evolution of the characters.  Like real people, they sometimes act in ways that seem out of character but are the perfect example of the contrast between the face we put on in public and what really makes us who we are on the inside.

One of the best examples of the evolution of the character of Michael Scott can be seen in ""The Job"".  As always, Michael assumes too much and thinks too little.  He makes a terrible decision about a romantic relationship on the basis of some very sexist interests in a woman's appearance.  However, in the end, he proves that he is actually a stand-up guy who is loyal to those who are not always deserving of this loyalty.  His character has the mentality of an overgrown child in that he can be unforgivably cruel and petty one moment and then truly lovable the next.

One of my personal favorites was ""Beach Games"" because it exemplifies the development of Pam's character.  Pam has long been my favorite but she is almost pathological in allowing others to walk all over her and take advantage of her good nature.  Her outburst in this episode was great to watch because it shows how determined she is to finally take charge of her life.  Throughout the season, she remains the nice woman she has always been but she begins to grow a backbone and to learn that being nice doesn't mean pleasing everyone at all times at the expense of her own happiness.

""The Negotiation"" is also an excellent episode because it shows the petty side of Jim and the heroic side of Dwight.  Jim's pettiness becomes more and more evident throughout the season and his seeming determination to hold Pam responible for Roy's actions and his cutting comments to her in the aftermath underscore just how mean he can be at times.  As for Dwight, the season has served to show what a surprisingly great guy he can be and this episode exemplifies this as he refuses to allow Jim to thank him for something he considers to have been his duty.

Aside from the powerhouse main characters, the tertiary characters of this show continue to astonish.  There is the often silly Kelly with the cheer I simply can't get out of my head (""This day is bananas.  B-A-N-A-N-A-S"").  There is the creepy Creed whose encounter with a fish in ""Beach Games"" made my husband and I roar with laughter.  There's the rather pathetic Toby, who is constantly dumped on by Mike and who takes his lovelorn status to new levels in ""Cocktails"" where his act of kindness is brushed off by an oblivious Pam.  I could go on and on for hours but, really, the best thing to do is to witness the series for yourself.  You'll doubtless become every bit as hooked as my husband and I are.",1202169600,18,3253,4.51965811965812
2886771,5,B000SINT4S,"The Office is by far the best sitcom on TV today.

Honestly, I really enjoy watching ""The Office"".  The show overall is one of my favorites, and season two in particular if funny, a definite improvement over season one.  I give this season four stars, however, because I know that sometimes I enjoy the show when perhaps I shouldn't.  This show is certainly not a model of cleanliness that marked the bygone era when entertainment writers were concerned with offending moral sensibilities.

To be sure, compared to much of the entertainment found on TV these days, this show is fairly clean.  There is basically no nudity (in terms of nudity, season two is cleaner than season three) and virtually no violence.  The objectionable material, then, is basically the written content... the humor.  And it is in this area that there are basically two areas of concern.  First, the language.  It is more than a rare occasion that questionable language is used, though clearly explicit language is practically never used.  Second, the humor and innuendo, the subject matter of the humor, is often inappropriate.  The entire show is basically crass.  While I don't think that all crass humor is inappropriate, and neither do I think that all the crass humor in this show is inappropriate, sometimes the humor crosses the that unidentifiable line into the offensive.  Nevertheless, this show has some redeeming qualities.  Aside from the crass humor, the humor of the characters themselves is incredibly funny.  In fact, I think the best part about this show is the strength of the characters and the extent to which they complement each other.

Perhaps the most serious challenge this show poses to the Christian faith are the more subtle critiques.  For example, there is not one serious Christian character.  The one character that is purported to be a Christian is really portrayed as a hypocrite and a mockery.  And the few truly endearing characters are clearly not Christian as they live non-Christian lifestyles (namely sleeping with and living with their boyfriends/girlfriends).  Needless to say, there isn't anything in this show that supports Christian morals or displays Christianity in a favorable light.

I would hesitate to give this item to anyone younger than 18 (a hesitation I'm sure most of the people reading this will find to be absurd).  What is needed is a viewer who can understand the subtle difference between making light and fun of social indiscretions and endorsing them.  Nevertheless, I think you can generally watch this show as a Christian without compromising your faith.  Overall I think season three pushes the envelope more than seasons one and two.  In season three there is more overtly sexual content and there seems to be more examples of foul language.",1201478400,2,3359,4.996396396396396

My wife was really disappointed that this season had only a handful of cast commentaries included on the DVDs.  Some of the other extras were funny.

2886777,5,B000SINT4S,"For the romances.  In season two, Jim makes a final play for Pam.  Hedging his bets against rejection, Halpert escapes DM Scranton to DM Stamford.  There he finds a more competitive office with swankier digs.  However, Jim is a fish out of water because he is hazed by co-workers (""Big Tuna"") and flounders at the military video game that Stamford uses as a motivational tool.  Despite this, Karen finds him a good catch and follows Jim back to Scranton when Stamford is closed.  Karen and Jim's relationship provide a few laughs, but serves mainly as interference to Pam and Jim's finally getting together.
More laughs are found with the other relationships around the office.  Ryan continues to be bullied into dating motor mouthed Kelly.  Phyllis marries Bob Vance, from Vance Refrigeration.  Dwight and Angela continue their creepy clandestine love affair. Dwight shows that he truly loves Angela by choosing to quit his job rather than go public to the office with their affair.
Above all the most explosive and embarrassing romances are Michael's. Somehow this guy bumbled into a love triangle with two successful attractive women in Season Two.  Michael and Carol's peter out when Michael becomes too clingy and proposes to her at the Diwali party. We are surprised when Jan, hell bent on destruction, picks up the pieces after Michael is dumped.  In the season's final episode Karen, Jim, and Michael are seen competing for Jan's job. (Ryan interviews secretly.)  This job serves as an ending for Jim and Karen, and a real beginning for Jan and Michael.  In the final seconds of the show, we see Ryan, the new MBA, get the job and the courage to break up with Kelly.  Season 3 leaves us anticipating more romantic laughs in Season 4.",1201392000,,1741,4.857627118644068

Jenna Fischer and John Krasinski are great as the work place friends who are constantly fighting off sexual and emotional tensions between them.

2886781,5,B000SINT4S,"I've spent many an hour laughing myself silly while watching Seasons 1, 2, and now... Season 3 of the Office!  I absolutely adore Steve Carrell's portrayal of petulant, immature, whiny, disrespectful, completely oblivious ""boss"" Michael Scott... then only to have him do a complete 180 and show himself to be so endearing, not to mention competent (!) and talented as a salesman and manager.

Highlights of Season 3 (for me):
--The introduction of Stanford employee (and transfer to Scranton) Andy Bernard.  I am in love with this guy.  You have not seen a person truly experience a meltdown until you have seen Andy punch a hole in the wall because he can't find his cell phone.
--Michael's ""welcoming"" of the new employees...WOW.  All I can say is, it is pretty impressive when you have 6 people (including Jim) transfer to your office, only to have 1 get fired, 2 resign, and 1 sent to anger management training because he punched a hole in the wall (yes, that was Andy).
--Beach Day!  Very funny episode.  Pam doing a walk across hot coals and then declaring to Jim how she truly feels, Andy helplessly floating away in a sumo wrestling costume because Angela refuses to help him, Dwight choosing ""Griffyndor"" for his team's name and Jim choosing ""Voldemort"" just to annoy and frighten Dwight... and of course, there's more.
--Phyllis's wedding (which of course Michael nearly ruins)... a[...]
--That insane scene where Roy (Pam's ex-fiance) nearly attacks Jim, only to be stopped by ... Dwight!!
--Pam and Karen vs Angela when they decide to throw separate Christmas parties.  Funny, funny stuff.

We bought this Season 3 as here in Australia, they stopped showing this season on TV after half the episodes, as Christmas is our non-ratings period.  The surprise was the deleted scenes, as I did not realise how much is actually cut out of each episode.  And the stuff that is cut out generally is as good as what is left in. For example, in Phyllis' Wedding, the scene with Angela and the Vet was terrific.  That whole episode was great, and is typical of how Michael's character seems to be increasing the 'cringe factor' as time goes on, and is almost too embarassing to watch (almost!).  I don't know how season 4 pans out, but would love to see more of Creed Bratton, as I think his character has plenty of unexplored creepiness.",1200268800,,795,4.387755102040816

New arrivals give the show a bit more energy, but really its all down to the core cast again, who make this show worth watching.

2886825,5,B000SINT4S,"Two reviewers made an observation many casual viewers of The Office would glance over: that Jim Halpert and Ryan Howard are darker inside than they appear on the outside. Another character that has escaped criticism is Pam Beesly; she has a dark heart that is veiled by her playful ""Girl Next Door"" exterior. First, in seasons one and two she was living together with Roy Anderson during their engagement period but before their marriage. In ""The Fire"" Pam became jealous and grabbed Roy and kissed him when she saw Jim flirting with Katy-this was done to hurt Jim. In ""Gay Witch Hunt"" it is revealed that Pam has broke her engagement with Roy. (Roy was a pig, also a one-dimensional character whose only purpose was to prevent a Jim/Pam relationship in seasons one and two. Still, breaking the wedding was cruel.) In the episode ""The Return"" Pam conspired with Jim in stealing Andy Bernard's cell phone in a prank that caused Bernard to ""fall down"". (I will not spoil the surprise for future viewers.) This was funny of course, but what happened afterwards was cruel, even though Andy is a pain. Last, in ""Phyllis' Wedding"" Pam became so depressed and jealous in watching Jim and Karen dance/flirt that she ""hooked-up"" with her old flame Roy for a one-night-stand.

And what comes next is definitely worth it.

Although every episode of a comedy show does not necessarily have to be connected with previous episodes (this is not a soap), some things about the characters can only be understood if you paid careful attention to passages over the first two seasons.

The classic blend of awkward situations with Michael, the craziness from Dwight and the love story between Jim and Pam creates a tasty concoction that I find my self craving between episodes.  While season three will not disappoint, I wanted to take the opportunity to discuss the character of the main man, Jim Halpert.  Jim Halpert, the knight in shining armor of every female who's ever followed The Office is beloved among many for being the ""nice guy"" who is head over heels for Pam.  In season three Jim's character takes another side, and he begins to be the guys who will play two girls before he decides which one he likes more.
  When Jim decides to come back to the Scranton branch he knows the reason he is returning, and no its probably not because he misses Dwight.
He's coming back to see Pam.  Yet even though he knows that that is his basis of motivation for returning he still tells Karen that if offered she should take the job up down in Scranton with him.  Upon return to his ""family"" Jim receives a Christmas present from Pam and turns her down.  He insists on visiting her at her desk in his every spare moment during season three, but still dating Karen at the same time for a safety net.  These examples make me a little wary that the ""nice guy"" that Jim is made out to be may not hold true in season four.",1192665600,,1447,4.345724907063197
2886832,5,B000SINT4S,"Few ""comedies"" anymore have me setting aside time to catch them week after week like this show.  What gives it this appeal is how unordinary a show The Office is.

Where as the last season focused mainly on Jim and Pam's budding relationship, there are several other office relationships this time around to keep it interesting.  This season also sees the addition of Karen and Andy to the cast as new employees from another branch of the company that got shut down.  By this point Karen and Jim have started seeing each other, which gives a shot of new life into the Pam/Jim storyline.  It's a pretty much the opposite of last season where Pam was engaged and Jim was secretly in love with her.  In the meantime Andy becomes Dwight's competition for the office suck up.

This season without a doubt piles on the drama, but that's not to say that it forgets to be funny.  A lot of the best comedic moment stem from the dramatic stuff and there are plenty of laugh out loud moments.  The writing is just as sharp as it ever was and the tone of the show never falters.  If you liked this show previously, there's no doubt that you'll continue to love it.  And those who haven't seen it... start at the beggining because all the storylines carry over from season to season.  The cliffhanger ending here isn't as good as last seasons (a really tough one to top)  but still leaves you wanting more.  Watch this show, it's too good to pass over.",1192665600,,1614,4.460750853242321

The boss, Michael Scott (Steve Carrel) believes (fantasy view) that his employees just cherish him and think of him as a father figure, but in fact Michael Scott finds always the wrong words to say at almost every occasion.  The show also revolves around a love triangle well written characters, Pam, Jim & Karen.  Jim of course still is in denial of Pam and how he feels while he dates Karen.  Believable, great characters makes for a great tv show.  Of course there is the tale of Dwight & Angela...bizarre relationship.

Plus, there are always the extras that the writers add such as the Toby Wraparounds and ""Kevin Cooks Stuff in the Office.""  I can't even look at pudding without thinking crme brle.

2886842,5,B000SINT4S,"What can I say about one of the most popular shows on television? Season 3 of The Office picks up right where Season 2 left off, continuing to deliver stellar comic performances. The introduction of the Stanford branch office of Dunder Mifflin adds such great characters as Ed Helms to the cast, as the ""preppy freak"" who ""went to Cornell...ever heard of it?"" We also get to witness the tragically hilarious breakdown of Jan Levinson, as she turns from the woman in charge to the cosmetically-enhanced emotional mess who, unbelievably, chooses Michael to be her rock. Jim and Pam continue their romantic game of cat and mouse, with Jim's new girlfriend Karen there to add a little spice to the equation.  And of coruse, Michael never fails to dissapoint.  His good-natured ineptitude leads to such wastes of time as a bird funeral, and a trip with the girls of the office to Victoria's Secret to celebrate Women's Appreciation Day.

When I started watching the American version I was hugely disappointed .... I thought it could never compete with the UK version which was hugely original and brilliantly put together.

The supporting characters are wonderfully real and flawed. Not to single any one of them out, as they're all worth watching (and how often can you say that about such a big cast), but Creed is a scream. How many layers of creepiness can one guy have? I haven't mentioned Michael Scott (Steve Carell) because his obvious comic brilliance is sort of compromised for me by the pain of watching his character in action.

Mike and Dwight can still make me shudder, even though I know in advance that they will do or say something horribly inappropriate. This is usually followed by a pause, while everyone looks at the camera.  It is a strange mix between sitcom and documentary, but it works.

The turning point for me was the Dwight Shrute music video. It is tucked away in the extra material, and you simply should not miss it. Words cannot describe this....thing.

As each character stumbles through life, they go to ridiculous extremes. Eventually all of their flaws are exposed, their pain revealed. This is a comedy, but sometimes it is so sad that you feel guilty for laughing. The characters are so self absorbed that they cannot even console each other. Their suffering is done in solitude, even if it is public solitude. Still, I couldn't stop myself from laughing out loud. It is over the top, but it is a lot like life in America today.

Abrams(Lost, Alias) and Harold Raims(Multiplicity, Bedazzled) the third Season of ""The Office"" is a very good season of a very good show.

2886872,2,B000SINT4S,"I find it highly interesting that Angela, the one Christian character on this show, is almost always portrayed in a negative light.  I understand that Angela is a bit judgemental of those who do not share her faith.  I know that rubs a lot of people the wrong way.  But they do not have to make her out to be a total shrew.

Do I laugh at times while watching this often sleazy show?  Of course, there are many clever and laugh-out-loud moments.  I like laughing at male idiots as much as my neo-femme sisters out there (unite!).  Michael Scott is a pathetic waste of life and Dwight Schrute is an even nerdier piece of garbage.  But unfortunately the females aren't really much better, suggesting an overall distain for humanity that isn't very becoming of the show's creative ""talents.""

Take Kelly for instance - pathetically dependant upon the affection of Ryan (who doesn't even like her, that rat!).  She's an airhead.

What about Jan Levinson?  You must truly be kidding me if you think she represents a headstrong feminist presence.  Her and Michael's troubled romance is a joke, if you ask me.  In this one rare instance, I actually do have some sympathy for the male - though Michael shouldn't allow himself to be so used and taken advantage of.

I guess most women, especially the young and inexperienced among you, relate the most to Jenna Fischer's Pam Beasley.  Heaven help me, that woman is the worst of the bunch.  Her artwork is beyond hopeless (and yes, I do know what I'm talking about thank you).  And her idea of a career appears to be sitting behind a front desk and answering phones.  How every fulfilling.  Look, I may not have kids either (not yet anyway), but I have dealt with them for years.  Parenting takes discipline, but it is one of the truest ""labors of love"" I know.  Pam has neither the maturity nor the intelligence to even consider becoming a mother.  Come to think of it, I believe only Stanley is a parent of all the people on the show.  What a shame.

Watch it for what it does best: portraying the utter cluelessness of the men who run our society.  But please don't think about it too much - treat it like a no-brainer and you will laugh.",1191369600,7,2181,4.514066496163683

2886882,3,B000SINT4S,"The third season of The Office lives up to the promise of the second season but - viewer beware - offers a much darker and, dare I say, creepier brand of humor than season 2, which may turn some viewers off. The Office has always taken delight in the kind of jokes and irony that will make you squirm, but this season is relentless in this kind of offbeat laugh.

As the season opens, Jim, rejected by Pam, transfers to the Stamford Branch and encounters a wacky group of co-workers there, including the sycophantic Andy and the ambitious Karen, with whom he strikes up a romanticv relationship. Back at Scranton, the usual Shenanigans are ongoing, until the Stamford branch closes and Scranton absorbs its workers, including Jim. What follows is a cold war between Pan (nominally back with Roy) and Karen for Jim's affections, Michael's continued on-again/off-again relationship with Jan, and more craziness than you can shake a stick at.

This season boasts a number of triumphs: ""Diwali,"" in which the office crew attends a Hindu festival and Michael makes a big mistake with his current ladyfriend; ""The Convict,"" in which the Scranton office is thrown into panic (especially Dwight) when it is discovered one of the Stamford employees once did time; ""Ben Franklin,"" in which simultaneous bachelor and bachelorette parties go horribly wrong; ""Business School,"" in which Michael is asked to lecture at a business school class and a bat is on the loose in the Scranton office; ""Beach Games,"" in which the Scranton crew goes to the beach for a day of fun - but Michael uses it as a chance to pick out his successor; and the season finale, ""The Job,"" in which Michael and Jan's relationship undergoes some extensive changes, Jim considers his future, and Dwight gives a sneak peek of how he would run the Scranton branch.

What I didn't like about this season is the near-absence of belly-laughs. The second season, with Jim's endless antagonism of Dwight, Jim and Pam's romantic flirtation, and the general insaniy of the Scranton crew, was a delight and will surely end up on the list of one of the greatest television seasons of all time. This season gets off to a slow start - Jims absense from Scranton is deeply felt and the season doesn't get going until about eight episodes in (although the season opener is pretty brilliant). Also, while Pam comes into her own as a character, her chemistry with Jim is missing due to his relationship with Karen, and the show thus loses one of its most valuable assets. This show functions best when everyone works as an ensemble - Steve Carell, for all his brilliance, cannot carry this show.

Additionally, as I mention above, the humor in this season tends towards the dark and creepy - characters show new sides that weren't there before, and it becomes rather unsettling (this becomes abundantly clear in the deleted scenes). Overall, however, a good season.",1191110400,13,2907,4.831325301204819
2886883,5,B000SINT4S,"Once this series got past the awkward first couple of episodes in Season One and the inevitable comparisons to the original British series, the American version of The Office has grown and grown into one of the funniest comedy shows in the last decade.

This Season has multiple classic episodes and some great new characters added into the mix of this near perfect comedy series.

But the happy fact of the matter is that this show is PACKED with great extras.  After virtually each episode, we're treated to at least 5 more minutes of deleted scenes.  Most of them are nearly as funny as the ""real"" scenes...time just didn't allow for everything to fit into the 30 minute format, or occasionally a totally new plot thread was obviously cast aside.  I'd give the discs 6 stars if they would also have the episodes with the delete scenes restored into the episodes...but that's just crazy wishful thinking.

Anyway, there are lots of other fun items...music videos, random appearances and promos, stuff from the Emmy awards, etc. etc.  For a fan of the show...these items are MUST SEE...not just filler.  So often, I find bonus materials hardly worth the trouble...but in THE OFFICE...they are essential.  So, in case it hasn't been emphasized enough before...this series is worth buying not just for the episodes you've probably seen before...but for the huge piles of extras!!",1190678400,,1245,4.722222222222222

Michael Scott is more unaware of how he is perceived than ever before and is more rude and insensitive than ever before. All the characters contribute greatly with their own little quirks and bizarre behavior. The only sane ones in the bunch are Jim and Pam. Everyone in this show is quirky and likeable and grow on you with each episode. The psuedo-documentary style is unusual but really makes this show happen. Sometimes just the look the characters give the camera says more than a page of dialogue. This is arguably this best sitcom on TV today. I hope to see many more seasons.

2886898,5,B000SINT4S,"...it get so much better! The storylines are still fresh. The acting is completely convincing and it leaves the viewer just wanting more and more (especially for Rainn Wilson).

I found myself asking ""what else can they do with this premise?"" One would think that being confined to an office setting, the storylines would get stagnant, but that is not the case. As the series progresses, the characters become more and more developed.

I'm amazed how the writers are able to weave all of these dynamic characters into a cohesive narrative, but they do it so successfully. The actors have great intuition and they play-off of each other very well.

In the third season, Jim has transferred to D-M's Stamford branch in Connecticut. They cleverly bounce back and forth between Scranton and Stamford establishing parallel narratives which intersect from time to time.

It's just a real treat to see the series progress. You think you know a certain character and their aspirations, but then you are surprised by revelations that arise throughout the show. All of the actors are superb and really understand their characters, but Rainn Wilson and Steve Carell really shine. Their performances are extraordinary because they are so multi-dimensional and will have you laughing, shocked, and empathetic all within a 21 minute episode and that's what makes a great television show.",1190160000,2,1373,5.116071428571429

2886902,5,B000SINT4S,"The Office is this awesome show about some cool, hip, good-looking people--Jim, Pam and Karen--who stick it to less attractive, socially awkward nerds.  I LOVE watching this show because I know that Jim (who's superawesome and funny and goodloking like me) is going to mock everyone because HE'S COOLER!!!  He even SLAPS DWIGHT IN THE FACE UNPROVOKED at one point and I'm like ""oh hells yeah, aweseom!""  Cause some people think I'm a jerk for belting on nerds but just look at THE OFFICE:  Nerds deserve to be made to feel small.  Not being cool IS A CRIME and jim halpert is like JUDGE DREDGE of a little state called PENNSYLVANIA--ever heard of it?

Besides nerds getting their comeuppance, the other great thing about the office is CORPORATE SPONSORSHIP!!!  A billion years ago it was uncool to take corporate sponsorships.  Take a hike, GRAMPS, time for THE OFFICE to get paid.  Corporations like HP and Microsoft and Staples are giant rich SUCCESSFUL corporations.  GUess what else is rich and successful?  Me!!!  So no suprise Microsoft and I both support the Office.

Plus, corporate sponsorship means MORE REALISM!!!  In real life people don't say ""Let's go to Office Supply Store X""--nope, they say Staples or whatever.  Ok, in the real world people might talk crap about Staples or Hooters or CHili's and obviously you can't do that to the people giving your show millions of dollars.  But so what?  Once you get big enough and powerful enough, IT'S ALL BUT AGAINST THE LAW TO CRITICIZE THEM IN PUBLIC!!!  I'd like to be that big and rich some day.  Sure the office is unrealistic in some ways like, I dunno, an office of 20 middle-aged people and only one of them (Stanley) is married.  Or neither Dwight nor Jim having ever been to a strip club.

But are family dynamics and sexual desire the integral components of reality?  Hell no!  THE UNCRITICAL USE OF BRAND NAMES is what makes reality so sprite-drinking-inducingly REAL!!  Guess what?  This second of reality is brought to by Coca-Cola, BENEVOLENT CORPORATE OVERLORD!!

2886903,5,B000SINT4S,"As I each watched each episode last season, I was in constant awe that a television series could maintain this amazing level of excellence.  My wife and son knew to avoid me when I was watching ""The Office"" since I would laugh hysterically and actually feel my stomach hurt.  Each episode added another piece to the puzzle and really did a number on fleshing out secondary characters (Jan, Kelly, Angela, etc.).  Even more amazing is the fact that the actors who play Ryan and Kelly wrote and directed some of this season.  When the season ended, I was so excited to get all episodes in one place, I began counting down the days to September.  With the Ryan angle set up during the last 10 seconds of the season, I am waiting anxiously for Season 4.  We should all rejoice that a show of this high quality is on right now for us to enjoy!!!!!

2886904,5,B000SINT4S,"This is an excellent DVD set for a number of reasons.

First, is just the quality of the show.  I think this show will go down in TV history as one of the best.  I watched them as aired on the network and the episodes were just as funny and entertaining the second time around.  Also, there were quite a few things that I missed the first time around.

The extras are great, especially the deleted scenes.  Most episodes are around 20 minutes and each show has 5-10 minutes of deleted scenes, all new and as funny as what was aired.

This is what a DVD set of a TV show should be and I give my highest recommendation-worth every penny!",1189382400,4,635,4.198347107438017
2886905,5,B000SINT4S,"Not too long ago, Arrested Development had me laughing hysterically, dropping my jaw in shock, and then laughing even more hysterically every episode.  Until, of course, it got canned.

I went through all 5 stages of grief.  Denial: another network will pick it up!  Anger: why this show?  WHY?  It is so funny!  Bargaining: Cancel my other favorite shows, I don't care, just don't take this one!  Depression: A show this funny will never come again!  NEVER! *Cries*

It wasn't until I saw The Office, specifically season 3, that I finally reached stage 5 with acceptance.  This show is not only as hilarious and shocking as Arrested Development, it actually has a sweet sprinkle of heart that Arrested Development never really had.

The Pam/Jim struggle has always been compelling, and season 2 left off with a frustrating cliff hanger.  But this time, the romance is switched from Jim chasing Pam to Pam chasing Jim.  It's truly compelling TV, watching Pam try to win Jim back, while trying to break into the art scene, all while keeping the whole Office family together.

While Michael and Dwight may provide the most laughs, Pam is who made me watch all of season 3 in just one weekend.  I just had to see what she was going to do; whether she would give up and be back with Roy again, or if she would have the courage to stand up and fight for what she really wants.

Season 1 was good, Season 2, despite the frustrating cliff hanger, was great.  Season 3?  Fantastic.  And this particular cliff hanger has to be the sweetest in television history.  You'll see what I mean.

There's also several other surprises in store.  I won't ruin them for you.  Must watch TV, my highest recommendations!",1189296000,14,1698,4.658783783783784

2886907,3,B000SINT4S,"I was so psyched to buy this. I have become a huge fan of ""The Office"" and have grown to love the characters. Expectations were high, and I must say, now, after having watched all of it, it didn't totally do it for me.
  The third season is almost like one continuous story; almost every episode is linked so that you have to watch them in order, or it won't make sense. I missed the randomness of season 2 (which will probably be the show's magnum opus); instead, the show became extremely personal and deep as the character's relationships are fleshed out. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it was almost too much. Too much over-the-top awkwardness, too much sexual innuendo, too much heartbreak. One thing the show is excellent at is making you a part of it so that you feel like you're part of the group of peope at Dunder-Mifflin. So when heartbreaking things happen (and believe me, they happen a lot in this season), you can totally relate. There's hardly a light moment, and when they come, they're welcomed. I felt the episode ""Traveling Salesman"" was the only one that felt true to the spirit of the show. But I found that after watching the whole season, I had a deeper caring for the people (notably Jim and Pam), which was very rewarding.
I will say I enjoyed the addition of Andy Bernard and Karen Filippelli. Andy is very well-played by Ed Helms, using Andy's annoying personality to create hilarious moments of outburst. Rashida Jones as Karen is probably the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, and I was shocked at times at how her relationship with Jim was often joyless. This is where the heartbreak comes in. Jim is dating Karen, Karen feels awkward with Pam, Jim has to balance out his friendship. Decisions, decisions.

MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD: There was a very touching moment at the last episode where we think Jim will get the job at corporate and continue his relationship with Karen. However, when he is in his interview, he finds a note that Pam slipped in, and his entire focus changes. He realizes that he still loves her, regardless of how much a beautiful woman like Karen likes him. And he goes back to Scranton without her, and suddenly, Pam and Jim are back. Sorry, Karen, Pam and Jim were meant to be.

The season does have some very touching scenes that will stay with you. But on the whole, I'll choose season 2 over this. Let's hope season 4 will be a return to form for the workers of Dunder-Mifflin Scranton we all love.",1189209600,9,2465,4.557562076749436
2886908,5,B000SINT4S,"Despite the fact it received tons of comparisons to the UK version, I always found the US version to be way better done. The show has finally felt like its own show and not just a simple offshoot like the other versions I've seen out there. While it does follow similar plot ideas, it kind of takes them and makes them feel fresh and not just simply ""well the Brits did it so we have to do it too"".

The start of the show centers on the fallout after Jim's big confession to Pam at the end of season 2. Having rejected him, twice, he has to make a change and moves to the Stamford branch. Of course, that branch closes and brings with it most of the personnel, leaving new office employees Andy and Karen. Meanwhile, Michael's still in the love/hate relationship between himself and his superior Jan while Roy is trying to get Pam back.

I tried to be intentionally small in describing the big events of this season because that's the fun out of it, in seeing how it develops and thankfully it's not handled in that unrealistic way I've seen in other shows (Grey's Anatomy fans, sorry). For example the Jim/Pam storyline has little moments to suggest their care they have still yet not fully say it such as a funny joke that no one else will get. The only one I'm not completely sold on is Andy since, while given many funny scenes or lines, he seems to be more noticeable from the other employees like he was put on the show specifically to be that wacky co-worker.

As for the comedy, there's definately elements of situation comedy where people can relate, there's just outright funny moments or lines and then of course there's that uncomfortable awkwardness that the UK did but at times I felt the British version relied on it too much, as well as their boss, David Brent. Brent was kind of an intentionally annoying and often mean-spirited guy whereas Michael Scott is just so oblivious to it.

I find it to be one of the more funnier shows on TV but also one with an actual sense of heart and characters that were endearing (unlike Tim, Dawn and Brent and a bunch of no-name people from the UK), I find it to be one of the more better-written comedies.",1188950400,5,2159,4.417085427135678
2886909,5,B000SINT4S,This show is the reason Thursdays feel like a holiday for me. This DVD is a must have for any fan of the show. The bonus features are awesome and watching the romantic passiob between Dwight and Angela is the best! haha... GO SCHRUTE!!!,1188864000,2,236,4.386363636363637
2886910,5,B000SINT4S,"Season 3 of ""The Office"" not only hilariously distinguishes itself from other generic comedies, but further extends the identity of the US version of ""The Office"" beyond the UK version.  In fact, i dare say that future reviewers shouldn't even bother with any comparisons.

When it comes to balance, ""The Office"" shows undeniable poise.  The format of the show with its pseudo-documentary camera work with the talking heads sections gives the show an aire of seriousness countered by the witty onscreen action and dialogue.  Also, while Michael (Steve Carell) and Dwight (Rainn Wilson) and their interaction with other characters provide the bulk of the awkward humor (i.e. Michael's obvious discomfort with topics like Oscar's out'ed homosexuality and being dominated in his relationship with Jan), the sweetness and sentimentality of Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) anchor the action with a love story caught in the lines of inevitability.

Sometimes characters seem to be one dimensional, but solid writing breaks them into instantly relatable people.  The forever strangeness of Dwight, but a sense of humanity in his relationship with Angela.  The everyman quality in Jim and his back and forth with the girl of his dreams.  The clueless boss in Michael that really just wants attention just like everyone else.

Overall, the third season of ""The Office"" comes highly recommended even without the additional special features and deleted scenes.  The humor may seem a bit slow for newcomers, but after a couple episodes its personality and humor is infectious.  ""Bears, Beets, Battlestar Galactica.""",1188777600,6,1616,5.3478260869565215
2886911,4,B000SINT4S,"The Office series for me would be something like saying 'You had me at episode four.' That was the first season.
If I was rating the second seaon, this review would probably have 5 stars above.
The third season was awesome; but it left me hoping for a little bit more. It did, however, contained some of the best episodes I have seen in a romantic comedy series ever.
I really thought Seinfeld was unbeatable as a comedy and for those of you who still do so please watch 'The Breakup' on this DVD set.
In a sense reviewing the Office Season Three is fruitless in that you have to see the first two seasons first; there is no way around it.
For a commedy that portrays characters so shallow and single minded, there are extremely important core values at the workplace portrayed thoughtout the season. You also have your cliffhangers and character development, and plot points so beautifully coordinated that it only takes a few short scenes to sum up episodes worth of build up. Now what surprises you the most is the fact that most episodes include scenes and passages that you really don't pay much attention to; scenes that build up to a season cliffhanger that really surprises the heck our of you.
I have not seen the BBC version of The Office nor would I ever understand how is that important to the US version. I don't see where you can get a BBC channel other than a 5 star hotel so WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO COMPARE IT?
The Office (US Version) is one heck of a TV series. Do watch it for fun, you'll laugh all the way to the end.",1188259200,10,1535,4.351916376306621
2886912,5,B000SINT4S,"I watched this show to see what all the fuss was about and I have to say it was dissapointing.

I didn't think the jokes were very funny. The show is mostly yelling. Just because it is loud doesn't mean it is funny.

Also. Why does the camera move around so much? It makes me dizzy.

I'd rather watch great TV comedies like Yes Dear or King of Queens which are shows that will be remembered as great TV comedies whereas this noisey drivel will fade into nothing.

I'm surprised it's been on TV this long and yet great shows like Dharma and Greg and Everybody Loves Raymond are off the air.

2886913,5,B000SINT4S,"I don't have HBO or anything premium, so I can't say for sure if this is the best comedy on television.  But without question it's the best network comedy and in the top three in network shows.

A lot of The Office UK purists trash the US version and I don't think that's fair.  First of all, I don't think they've watched enough episodes to pass judgment.  Second, even if they had watched several, I doubt they'll give it a fair chance.  I personally think Ricky Gervais is hilarious and I liked the UK version.  Unfortunately, the fact that this is a remake of a beloved show in the UK will make it instantly unappealing in many eyes.  But let's remember that Gervais has his blessing on this show as an executive producer.

As far as the third season goes, it's superb.  The Michael and Jan storyline progresses quite a bit, much more so than the Pam-and-Jim saga.  The passive-aggressive Ryan character gets some further development.  The addition of Ed Helms as goofball Andy Bernard, like him or hate him, adds another dimension of humor to the ridiculously talented cast.  Rashida Jones plays it effectively straight as Karen.

In all, this is another great chapter in The Office series.  I have to say Season Two is still my favorite.  But Season Three does not disappoint.",1188172800,,1282,4.635555555555555

Season one was met with mixed reviews, while season two slowly witnessed the show separating itself from its British counterpart. Enter season three and the show comes around full circle.

In addition to the introduction of new faces and cast regulars, the audience will get the feeling that the original characters and their personalities are finally being developed. The first half of the season focuses on company downsizing; the second half focuses on office relationships, particularly the heightening tension between the two most normal Dunder Mifflon employees, Jim Halpert and Pam Beesly.

From beginning to end, this season is packed with some of the show's finest, most comedic-gold moments. Unfortunately, as with most great shows, the quality diminished with every new season and the plots became more outlandish and implausible. Let's put that aside for a moment.
