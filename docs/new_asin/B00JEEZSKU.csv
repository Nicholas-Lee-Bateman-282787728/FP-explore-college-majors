6355877,2,B00JEEZSKU,"OK - well, first off, this isn't a horror movie, or scary in any way at any point - it's a really bad comedy horror film. At first, I thought the acting was so bad (the lead is a nerdy guy who talks like he's reading directly from the script) that it was actually really GOOD acting and I had a glimmer of hope that they were going someplace with this one. But, no. It's just a terrible film. But, if you enjoy watching really bad ""found footage"" c-movies, you may actually get a kick out of this one. It's more like a community college ""Introduction to Filmmaking 101"" production than anything else (and I think it might be, actually). There are scene so bad that you'll actually LOL (like the scene in which they are in their tent sleeping and the monster is just outside making all kinds of noise and grunts and the lead character, who is about 5 feet from the roaring monster, still acts like he can't hear anything and his buddy just kinda gives up on waking him and goes back to sleep)... Bottom line: if you can see this for 0.99 or free, it's worth it just for the LOLZ. Oh and the monster is hysterically, laughably badly costumed with fake fangs and a ghillie suit. Great movie if you have the flu and need some laughs.",1413504000,4,1229,4.278969957081545

6355881,5,B00JEEZSKU,"The Legend of Six Fingers is a great horror film about a pair of crypto-zoologist scientists that enter a remote wooded area in search of a legendary creature that has been killing local animals.  They begin interviewing people in the area of the woods and embark on an investigation into the woods with the information that they received from the witnesses that they interviewed.  Little do they realize that they are walking into a nightmare.  The Six Fingers monster is huge and frightening and has absolutely no regard for human life.  This is not your average bigfoot type creature. It is much larger and different looking. It is almost a combination of a large bear and a gorilla but different. It walks on hind legs and has a hideous growl. If this movie does not shock you, you'd better see a psychiatrist, QUICK.  A great cast includes Sam Qualiana and Andrew Elias as the scientists, Bill Brown and Lynn Lowrey play the couple who reveal the legend of Six Fingers. The actors are excellent and bring this story to life.  While different in overall story, it is reminiscent of The Ruins or Cherynoble Diaries in that the case is drawn into a living nightmare.  I enjoyed this movie very much and highly recommend it. Gary Evans",1407542400,3,1236,4.694444444444445

8650237,4,B00JEEZSKU,"I have been collecting Bigfoot related movies for a while.  I finally picked this one up despite the negative reviews.  I have to say there are a lot worse movies out there. This one was obviously low budget, (IMDB estimates $5000.00) but it is not at all unwatchable. Yet another in the deluge of found footage entries of the genre. There are rough spots that I attribute to direction, or maybe not following direction. However, the director is one of the better actors, I enjoyed his characters sarcasm and wit.
The story content and dialog were fairly well written. Unfortunately the dialog was frequently poorly executed. The pronunciation of the word documentary caught me by surprise. This must be a regional thing, as everyone pronounces it the same way. Many of the bit parts are acceptably acted, but the main character really struggles. I thought he was attempting to play a nerdy character, but after watching him in the extra features Im not so sure.  Ill give him credit for the best tee shirts though.  Even the gratuitous Snow Shark plug.
The nature shots at first seemed out of place but the photography was impressive. Some older Bigfoot movies dedicate time to nature, so this could be in homage. The camera must have been decent quality because the picture was great for a DVD. The sound quality was decent but the volume occasionally shifted. The dialog in the vehicle was quite loud, while some exterior shot dialog was attenuated. It seemed more noticeable in the first half of the movie.
For a low budget film, the creature effects work fairly well. (except for his dental issues  Im not sure what is going on with the tusks) He gets quite a bit of screen time. I didn't care for the texture of the creatures hair, but I suspect that too is a cost decision. His growls and roars are quite believable. It has a nice deep pitch. The best shots are when the creature is motionless.  Unfortunately he moves like a man sweating his butt off in a heavy suit. The suit may have contributed to the creatures lackluster movements, certainly better motion would add a great deal of authenticity. As well, some of the camera angles reveal he is no taller than most of the humans he gets close to.
I haven't researched the Native American Ya-Yahk Osnuhsa lore in the Lake Ontario region but I suspect there was more that could have been discussed or brought out which would add to the interest factor of the story. As is, the backstory presented was sufficient.

As long as you are not expecting much, and realize the shoestring budget, this is a nice early effort for a young director with some talent.",1460764800,,2614,4.657266811279826

8650240,2,B00JEEZSKU,I don't have high expectations when i go into a bigfoot movie but somehow I was still disappointed. This movie gave me an peek into the director's mind and I didn't like what i saw,1432252800,,180,4.171428571428572
8650241,1,B00JEEZSKU,"I wish I would have read the reviews before renting.  This is a horrible movie.  It looks more like a high schooler's film project.  The lead has some type of lisp that is really annoying.  I should have known, when there was no trailer.  Even a short trailer would have made me run away from this.  Lesson learned.  I am nut sure if this is suppose to be a comedy or what.  Heed everyone's warning DON'T rent this.",1428019200,3,415,4.230769230769231

8650243,3,B00JEEZSKU,"This is a very fun movie. First off, it is a parody of classic Bigfoot movies like ""Barbaric Beast (Legend) of Boggy Creek"", ""Legend of Bigfoot"", and ""Creature from Black Lake""; not to mention more recent movies including ""Blair Witch Project"", and ""Pursuit of/ In Search of a Legend"". Andrew Elias as Neal is perfectly cast as the self-conscious, geeky goofball all the way to the end! Director Sam Qualiana is very funny/excellent as Andrew. Don't miss the first appearance of Six Fingers! It's drop-dead hilarious, with an air of deposed royalty! The key to this movie is the tongue-in-cheek humor, all the way to the bloody end...Enjoy!",1423785600,,640,4.935185185185185
8650244,2,B00JEEZSKU,"Normally I like low-budget crap but this was downright awful. The acting was horrendous and felt very weird and awkward at times. There were random shots of tons of trees, bugs, just walking around the woods in general that made no sense. The overall creature was hilarious to look at and the interactions between the two characters and the monster was laughable. Glad I rented it instead of buying it. Very very bad movie.",1414800000,2,423,4.72972972972973
