4862413,5,B005S9ELM6,"The Iranian Hostage Crisis has been over for more than 30 years, and for those who don't remember that time in history, it was a prominent domino on the path that led to 9/11.  Ben Affleck's direction of this true story is a compelling look back at that important time in U.S. history.  Mixing in news broadcasts, newspapers, magazines, and real-life people along with the actors in this movie, the film delivers a suspenseful and fast-moving 2 hours (an estimate only, don't harp if I'm off by a few minutes) that seem to go by in about an hour.  Affleck himself is at the center of the movie, but downplays his role and goes into the character without glamour or fanfare.

This was an excellent movie, and one that I recommend strongly to just about anyone.",1350172800,4,759,4.5588235294117645
4862414,5,B005S9ELM6,"It's hard to believe it's already been 33 years since the Iran hostage crisis, and Ben Affleck's ""Argo"" makes it seem like it's all happening now. Chris Terrio's script, based on the memoirs of CIA agent Antonio J. Mendez, has the urgency of today's headlines. This true story of how Mendez (Affleck), working with a real-life Hollywood producer (Alan Arkin) and special effects wizard (John Goodman), created a ruse to get six American diplomats out of Tehran is amazing stuff, and Affleck keeps us on the edge of our seats, with very few sequences that lag even slightly.

In its urgency and topicality, ""Argo"" is reminiscent of ""Charlie Wilson's War."" In its breathtaking suspense in recreating an historical incident whose outcome is well-known, it resembles ""Apollo 13."" This is high praise indeed, and totally deserved. Affleck gives a solid, sympathetic performance as Mendez (he also looks great in his hippie hair and beard, once you get over the initial shock). Even more, he fulfills the abundant promise as a director that he demonstrated in his first two films, ""Gone Baby Gone"" and ""The Town."" (Interestingly, one of ""Argo's"" producers in George Clooney, another leading man who became a fine director.) Affleck assembled a wonderful crew, including photographer Rodrigo Prieto, editor William Goldenberg, composer Alexandre Desplat and production designer Sharon Seymour. He also has wonderful actors: Arkin and Goodman give delightful, Oscar-worthy comic performances, and there is also fine work by Bryan Cranston as Mendez's boss, Victor Garber as the Canadian ambassador, and literally dozens of others. (The end credits demonstrate that the actors playing the American diplomats bear an astonishing resemblance to the historical characters they play.) Clean, swift, and straightforward, ""Argo"" is a state-of-the-art historical/political thriller.",1350172800,3,1866,5.501742160278746
4862415,5,B005S9ELM6,"While Ben Affleck's acting career has its share of hits and mostly misses, he's now 3 for 3 as a director.  Here he recreates a real life rescue which only came to light in 1997.  If you were around in 1979 or have knowledge of history you are already familiar with what is known as the ""Iranian Hostage Crisis.""

When the deposed Shah was allowed to enter the U. S., Iranians were none too happy.  They wanted his head in a noose.  As a result, they stormed the American embassy, imprisoning the ambassador and his staff for more than 400 days.  What didn't come to light until later is that 6 staff members were able to escape through a back door.  In this film they were secretly taken in by the Canadian ambassador (Victor Garber).

CIA ""exfiltration"" specialist Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) came up with a plan to bring them out by passing them off as a Canadian film crew scouting shooting locations for a faux film called ""Argo.""  Mendez gets the authorization from his boss (Bryan Cranston) and enlists John Chambers (John Goodman) and Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) who were real life movie-makers to create the background for the film.

Affleck could be fairly criticized for casting himself in the lead, but he is spot-on with the rest of the cast including those mentioned above.  All could be up for Oscars in a few months, especially Arkin.  They add some needed snarky humor to the serious events in which they are involved.  This helps ease the tension Affleck masterfully creates in this gripping film.  He manages to take a true story of great importance and give an audience 2 hours of exhilarating entertainment.  The final act found me with a white knuckle grip on the armrest, although I did think the last second chase of a rumbling 747 was more theatrical hyperbole than actual events.  That minor quibble aside, ""Argo"" is one of the best films of the year.",1350172800,,1874,4.633333333333334
4862416,5,B005S9ELM6,"It was only a few weeks ago that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated the threat of a Nuclear Iran with his undistinguished cardboard bomb chart. At this delicate time, it would seem a film about the 1979 Hostage Crisis could add fuel to the fire of an aggressive position on Iran. At least, it would seem that Argo would be a film to anger or frustrate one side of the political spectrum. Yet, it miraculously doesn't. And for that, it cements Ben Affleck's reputation as a top director.

Argo tries to understand the 1979 Hostage Crisis in which 52 Americans were taken hostage for over a year. The film centers on the six people who secretly fled to the Canadian Embassy. The film focuses on the attempts of the American government to bring back these six through a myriad of unusual and strange tactics. Their best ""bad idea"" is to set a fake film production, Argo, in Iran, and guise these individuals as part of the crew. Supplied with fake credentials, the hope is to get these people on a plane back home.

Argo is simply bizarre for the standards of Hollywood political thrillers. The film starts by establishing the reasons for Anti-American sentiment in Iran and reinforces these sentiments throughout the film. It also shows the anger of Americans without resulting to exaggeration. The most impressive thing about the film is Affleck's eye for detail. Either he researched a lot about Iran or had good researches on his side, as his film showcases a very realistic revolutionary Iran. Filmed in Mclean, Virginia, Washington D.C. and Istanbul, one still get the sense of being in Tehran in those historic days. However, a criticism can be made that Argo shows a more conservative Iran that would have been seen in 1979. The conservative, Islamic image may be appropriate for early 80's Iran, but may be a little too drastic for the eve of the revolution.

Affleck has made two movies: one amidst a revolution and the other in Hollywood. The fake film, Argo, eats away a portion of the time duration but not enough to be intrusive to the flow of the movie. Affleck makes some insider Hollywood jokes, but quickly phases back in to the hostage crisis. He avoids the damning curse of actually filming anything with his fake crew when his character arrives in Iran. He smoothly transitions between the frustrations of Iranians, the fear of the hostages, the artificial Hollywood atmosphere, and the unpredictable mood in Tehran.
Argo is better than the vast majority of this or the past decade's political movies. It avoids the obtrusive political jargon and leftist positions of films like Syriana. Even though George Clooney is one of the producers, the film succeeds by not becoming another Clooney-like political thriller. That is, a movie so simple in its philosophy yet so complex in its execution. Simply but, Argo is a magnificent achievement for Affleck. Though Gone Baby Gone showed his potential, Argo establishes him as a true auteur. At the end of the film, we don't really hate the Iranians or root for the hostages because their Americans. We want them to escape because their innocent bystanders caught in a political game.",1350086400,2,3163,4.8645640074211505
4862417,5,B005S9ELM6,"""Argo"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: The true story of the life-or-death covert operation to rescue six Americans, which unfolded behind the scenes of the Iran hostage crisis--the truth of which was unknown by the public for decades.

The cast led by Ben Affleck (also produced and directed) (as Tony Mendez), Bryan Cranston (as Jack O'Connell), Alan Arkin (as Lester Siegel) & John Goodman (as John Chambers) is brilliant. The (Oscar-winning) screenplay by Chris Terrio (based on the article ""Escape From Tehran"" by Joshuah Bearman) is brilliant.

The music by Alexandre Desplat is brilliant. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is brilliant. The (Oscar-winning) film editing by William Goldenberg is brilliant. The casting by Lora Kennedy is brilliant. The production design by Sharon Seymour is brilliant. The art direction by Peter Borck & Deniz Gokturk is brilliant. The set decoration by Jan Pascale, set dressings by Michael Keith Aleshire-Rezendez, Doug Devine, Justin Freibrun, Selin Gungor, Mark Kwiatkowski, Gordon McVay, Cynthia C. Rebman & Michael A. Watt, set designs by Daniel R. Jennings & Barbara Mesney is brilliant. The costume design by Jacqueline West is brilliant. The visual effects supervised by Matt Dessero, Bryan Godwin, Lubo Hristov, Don Lee, Gregory L. McMurry & Thomas J. Smith, coordinated by Lauren Guerard, Rachel Faith Hanson, Shane Strickman & Mark Van Ee is brilliant. The special effects coordinated by Barry McQueary is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by Gary Hymes, Mark Henson & J.J. Perry is brilliant.

This is a brilliant and well-made, well-acted film that is entertaining. This is another true story tale that has been done (filmed) well. This is another brilliant movie from Ben Affleck, right in league with ""Gone Baby Gone"" & ""The Town"". He also leads a well-acted ensemble, filled out with solid performances by Cranston, Arkin & Goodman, also Affleck himself, too. This is one of the best films of the fall season and of the year, with Oscar consideration talk on the plate. And it was, of course, the Oscar winner for Best Picture of the Year.",1350086400,2,2109,5.178885630498534
4862418,5,B005S9ELM6,"Despite knowing the outcome, the viewer can feel the tension ratchet up. All the actors hit the real notes. No foolish acting, just real scared people, in deadly situations. And when the real photos flash at the end, those without knowledge of the events will marvel at the recreations. Ben is not afraid to treat his audience with intelligence. He deserves any awards available.",1350000000,3,379,4.9375
4862419,5,B005S9ELM6,"Argo, not to be confused with Fargo or with Esso, the gas station, is one hell of a timely as hell movie. If you do not understand what the word timely means, it is defined by the Free Dictionary as ""something that occurs or happens to occur in a relevant period of time."" That describes Argo to a tee because we Americans just experienced the national tragedy known as the Death of Ambassador Christopher Stevens (who might have been g/a/y, too) because Obama and Hillary Clinton were too busy ignoring the requests of the U.S. embassy in Libya for added security. That certainly explains why everyone in the Obama administration first tried to insult the intelligence of all Americans by getting everyone to believe that a harmless, little YouTube video was behind the terrorism! Needless to say, everyone in the Obama administration now looks like a bunch of lying liars who told a bunch of...lies as they laughably try to walk back their original blame of the YouTube video.

In this context, Ben Affleck's--who's greatest movie role was Daredevil, by far--Argo is unbelievably...timely! It's like Gigli himself somehow saw the future and made a movie about current events...before they happened.

In Argo, the plot revolves around the Iranian revolution exploding, and how a CIA specialist comes up with a daring plot to liberate some Americans who have been hiding at the bachelor pad of the Canadian ambassador. Excuse me, now: At this point, I have to leave to get up to go to the bathroom. I will be back in about 20 minutes. (20 minutes later). Okay, I'm back. I'm awfully sorry, but I had a lot of Fresca to drink a while ago.

It's clear what Ben Affleck's point with Argo is. He is clearly saying that all Americans should pretend to be Canadians if they are traveling abroad, especially in Iran, just like when the Iraq War was going on and Dubya was in office. See, Affleck's point is that even though Canadians look, act and sound just like Americans (except for their mispronunciation of words like ""out"" and ""about""), the whole world loves them because they are very dull people who secretly hate all Americans. In Affleck's film, this theme is brought to the forefront when the ""evil"" Americans are persecuted by the Islamonazi Iranians and take refuge in the apartment of the canuck ambassador. The movie, in my humble opinion, takes an outlandish turn when the Americans are secretly smuggled out of Iran by hiding in maple syrup jars that Iran happened to be exporting to North Korea.

Still, this movie was very riveting and highly intelligent. I can't believe that Ben Affleck is such a mature filmmaker now, especially when he was such a massive box-office star with his monster hits like Gigli and Daredevil just a few years back! Oh well, if he is now able to produce such sharply insightful films like this--where the main message is how Canadians are loved by the whole world for nothing more than hating Americans while failing to produce anything of significance in their whole country's history--then I want to nominate Ben for best director at next year's Tonys.",1350000000,4,3095,4.81203007518797
4862420,2,B005S9ELM6,"""Argo f*** yourself."" You can go ahead and pack up your things; you've just experienced the most enjoyable part of Ben Affleck's ""Argo."" In all seriousness, ""Argo"" has the precise formula to be a sure fire Oscar winner. Affleck went to great lengths to make the film look aged and grainy while there were plenty of bad 70s hairstyles, bushy porn star moustaches, and unbuttoned shirts with huge collars that scream ""in case of emergency disco dancing pop up."" The camera work deserves some accolades, as well. Near the beginning of the film, there's a scene with a helicopter where you feel like you're riding right along with the pilot. The shot starts at ground level and then slowly shoots up into the air.

The performances are pretty strong all around. Affleck portrays a man in purgatory; not only is he in charge of six people's lives but he's also separated from his wife who has custody of their son. Affleck's Tony Mendez character seems mostly emotionally absent the entire film and rightfully so. The six Americans stranded in Iran all portray panic and anxiousness very well. John Goodman as make-up effects artist John Chambers is fantastic as is Alan Arkin as movie director Lester Siegel. Goodman is funny and charming right from the start while Arkin has this no BS type of humor that comes with all his years in the movie business. His quick wit, particularly during the meeting him and Affleck have regarding the rights to ""Argo,"" instantly makes him the highlight of the film.

Ever since Bryan Cranston became a household name in ""Breaking Bad,"" he's been popping up in a lot of movies; ""Red Tails,"" ""John Carter,"" ""Madagascar 3,"" ""Rock of Ages,"" ""Total Recall,"" and now ""Argo"" in 2012 alone. He usually brings that same intensity you love him for in ""Breaking Bad"" to every role he has even if the project he's a part of isn't very good. ""Argo"" may be his best effort film-wise so far. He's just so good as a man who has no other options; when his character is at the end of his rope. His form of frustrated panic is outstanding and thanks to the magic of R-rated films has a chance to be completely unfiltered here.

What's disappointing about ""Argo"" is that it's really dull. Speaking as someone who isn't really interested in the subject matter of the film, any interest at all was solely based on the feedback it's received. Any scenes revolving around developing the fake movie and that include John Chambers or Lester Siegel are immediately entertaining, but that's obviously secondary. There's a lot of sitting around and waiting and drinking. How Tony Mendez drinks so much without showing any signs of feeling it is kind of astounding.

Seeing the mechanics of it all as it's happening gets pretty redundant. There's this blue balls mentality to the film where it teases so many things that could happen but then they don't or it strings you along for so long and then is just like ""Oh, nevermind."" You can only watch people talking, having things go wrong, and them scrambling to figure out a last minute solution so many times before you figure out where things are headed. It really seems difficult having knowledge of the events the film is based on and how everything turns out and still being able to enjoy the film. It seems like knowing the answer to the riddle beforehand would make it less enjoyable.

While ""Argo"" will more than likely be nominated for best picture at The Academy Awards that doesn't mean it's going to cater to everyone or that anyone who sees it is going to fall in love with it. If it wasn't for the performances of John Goodman, Alan Arkin, and Bryan Cranston, it would actually be pretty boring. How bad the fake sci-fi movie seems pulls you in more than the horrible events going on in Iran.

Some moments are tense, but many are portraying it as this overwhelming sensation that never lets up during its two hour duration and that just isn't the case; whether or not you're interested in politics or the history surrounding the events of the film will play or big role in your enjoyment of the film itself. ""Argo"" may be a good film that was just viewed by someone who isn't its target audience, but in the meantime just seems like another Ben Affleck related project that's being over praised because of who's attached to it and its bureaucratic subject matter.",1350000000,20,4328,4.680683311432326

It's an important detail that seems to get left out of the Western conversation of how modern day tensions arose and is important to be addressed for future improved relations. That said, it also made me appreciate Canada more and felt a sense of pride that someone like Mendez was willing to take such a huge risk for his fellow countrymen.

Would Ben Affleck succeed in getting the six embassy staff out of Iran?  A very serious and emotional story was handled with finesse.  Like George Clooney in ""Michael Clayton"" Affleck was the fix it man of the day and knew what had to be done with a self assurance that should be a primer for youth.  There was also a good deal of humour from the Hollywood connection which provided some much needed relief from the tension of the plot but in no way distracted or detracted from the seriousness of it all.

4863002,5,B005S9ELM6,"Argo is the Academy Award-winning (Best Picture, 2012) spy movie thats based upon the true story of one of the most implausible  and successful  operations in the history of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). This was the daring rescue of six American embassy workers who escaped from the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Iran when the embassy was taken over by militants in November 1979. (At that time, the militants captured 52 other Americans and held them hostage for 444 days. The six who escaped found shelter in the Canadian embassy, where they stayed for eleven weeks before being rescued.)

Argo tells the story of that daring rescue. The film opens with carefully reconstructed scenes that show hundreds of Iranian militants demonstrating at the gates of the embassy. Eventually they swarm through the gates, climb the walls, and invade the compound. Six American embassy workers  four men and two women  are located in an outer building with direct access to a street. They realize that if they don't leave  right now  they will be captured. They depart into a hostile city, and eventually end up as houseguests at the Canadian Ambassadors residence.

American government officials don't become aware of the six escaped Americans plight for weeks. The Canadians want them out, but they won't abandon them to the Iranians. They begin pressuring U.S. State Department to do something. That something turns out to be a seemingly preposterous plan concocted by CIA operative Antonio Mendez (Ben Affleck). His idea is to set up a fake movie production team looking for shooting locations inside Iran. Posing as the fake films producer, Mendez would enter Iran, pick up the six houseguests, and introduce them as members of his advance team. If all goes according to script, everyone would simply fly out of Iran in broad daylight, right under the noses of the Iranian police

History tells us that the rescue was successful, but how well does Mendez plan work, and what obstacles does he face? Watch Argo and find out.

Argo has a great cast that includes Ben Affleck (who also directed the film and received a Best Director Academy Award nomination for it), Alan Arkin, John Goodman, Bryan Cranston, and Kyle Chandler. Lesser-known character actors played the parts of the six houseguests. All of them did a wonderful job. Chris Terrios Academy Award-winning screenplay, which is primarily based on Mendez memoir Master of Disguise, sparkles with witty dialogue, and contains a nice blend of humor and tense drama.

 Argo does take some dramatic license with historical facts that has earned it some deserved criticism. Nevertheless, it remains a reasonably accurate portrayal of how the six houseguests were rescued from Tehran at a particularly precarious time. Argo is a wonderfully entertaining movie. Highly recommended.",1470614400,2,2828,5.123913043478261

Mendez in conjunction with a selected wired magazine article ""The Great Escape"" by Joshua Bearman, magnificently on the big-screen portrays this electrifying, now declassified, true story of a daring and heroic plight to freedom. This cast includes Academy Award winning Actor - Alan Arkin and Emmy Award winners - John Goodman and Bryan Cranston. This compelling, suspenseful, thriller will have you on the edge of your seat. As you watch... one man - Tony Mendez (Affleck), lead 6 American hostages out of harms way and back to their homes, in the United States of America. This brilliant, brave and cunning, CIA Agent who specialized in dangerous and supposedly impossible escapes, especially... from enemy territory, ingeniously incorporated movie-making into his plan of escape. The 6 hostages posed as a Canadian film crew complete with Canadian Passports, that was shopping for a location in Iran for the filming of their 'science fiction' movie. With the Iranian Revolution in full swing and the American Embassy there... being invaded and subsequently entirely seized by irrate Iranians, 6 Americans ran for cover to the neighboring Canadian Embassy which shielded and assisted them, until their daring recovery rescue by the courageous, CIA Agent - Tony Mendez. As a born Canadian residing within the United States, I am truly grateful that the United States and Canada are on friendly border terms, both here and abroad. This incredible, true-life, big-screen depiction will have you weeping with tears of joy, that two Great Nations - the United States and Canada, whose governments adhere to Democracy, united and successfully retrieved 6 American hostages, from a hostile country on another continent. This powerful movie will inspire, enlighten, historically educate and have you flying both American and Canadian flags..., High!! It's amazing what two Allied Countries (US & Canada) can do together..., ""in pursuit of life, liberty and happiness!"" God Bless the United States of America and God Bless, Canada. This film is absolutely superb and you can't help but be..., very deeply, moved! A definite keeper for your DVD collection. Nina Kish",1470096000,,2830,5.361797752808989

This was a fascinating recount of the cooperative, clandestine process to move these Americans safely out of Iran from where they were sheltered at the Canadian ambassador's residence. The recreation of the U.S. embassy takeover in Teheran is chilling, and brings back the feelings of frustration that we could not protect our citizens abroad from such terror and humiliation, and that it took 444 days to free them. Yet the determination of Ben Affleck's character to create and sustain a ruse to rescue his fellow Americans with the help of the Canadian government is truly inspiring.",1464134400,3,777,5.0310077519379846

4863251,4,B005S9ELM6,"After the shah (their king), Reza Pahlavi, was given asylum in the U.S. for his terminal cancer treatment, the Iranian people erupted  in protest outside the U.S. Embassy. They demanded that the shah be returned and tried and hanged. The shah was despised because he lived in lavish excess and opulence while his people starved. The shah maintained ruthless power through his internal police force, the SAVAK. Under his dictatorship, an era of torture and fear reigned as he campaigned to westernize Iran. This enraged the mostly traditional Shiite population. In 1979, the Iranians overthrew the shah, and the exiled cleric, Ayatollah Khomeini, returned to rule Iran. Iran was a nation of 35 million where many of the people looked forward to martyrdom at that time. They seized the embassy in Iran, on November 4, 1979, and held 50 Americans hostage and were not going to release them until the shah was returned to Iran. They accused the American ambassadors of being spies controlled by large U.S. oil companies. Six Americans escaped the embassy and took refuge at the Canadian Ambassador's residence in Tehran. Tony, a CIA operative with a wife and 10-year-old son, had an unshakable confidence in himself such that he could get others to believe in him, too. Tony volunteered to go to Iran with the alias of Kevin Harkins, a Canadian film producer. To rescue the six Americans, he devised a plan of pretending to be a Canadian film crew on a location scout for a science-fiction movie. They had to walk a minefield, on pins and needles throughout the entire episode in hopes of making it home alive. The Carter Administration, got cold feet at one point, and nearly pulled the rug out from under Tony and the six ambassadors in midstream no less, fearing national disgrace and public outrage if the CIA-backed scheme was foiled and the truth came out. The Canadian embassy cooperated with the CIA in freeing the six hostages in Tehran. It wouldn't have been possible without the Canadian government protecting them and assisting in their safe passage out of Iran. President Carter awarded Tony Mendez with the Intelligence Star, the highest award of merit of Clandestine Services of these U.S. The Iranian Hostage Crisis ended on January 20, 1981, when all remaining hostages were released. They spent 444 days in captivity.",1459036800,,2331,4.961636828644501

4863295,4,B005S9ELM6,"Most people, myself included, really enjoyed ""Argo"". If you don't already own the film, this Extended Edition might be the way to go. But if you already own the original blu-ray release, then is it worth an upgrade? Well, hopefully the details below will help you make a decision.

Included on the blu-rays:
- Theatrical Edition of the movie
- Extended Edition of the movie (an extra 10 minutes added to the film)
- 3 New Special Features + all the special features from the previous blu-ray release

Included in the box set:
- 40-page book premium featuring behind the scenes photos, production notes, bios and more
- Argo One-Sheet Poster (you know they are going to fold it to fit it in the box, so it will have creases right down the middle)
- Map of Tehran movie locations (14"" x 20"")
- Reproduction of Tony Mendez's CIA ID card

So if you enjoyed the movie, then you might want to consider picking this up. I'm interested in seeing if the extra 10 minutes of footage improves the film (not that it needs improvement); and with three all-new special features and the book/memorabilia from the film, this set might be worth it.

He did it in the movie ""The Town"" where he is sitting outside and they talk about a clear blue sky or a clear day makes the girl sad. Ben Affleck isn't just another pretty face, there is a deep soul under that. Don't hate him because he's beautiful. :D  His brother Casey is also very talented.

4863806,4,B005S9ELM6,"The film, ""Argo,"" is a very entertaining adventure ride about the escape of six American diplomats hiding at the Canadian Embassy in Tehran, Iran while the American Embassy was invaded and the other diplomats became hostages.

Ben Affleck plays Tony Mendez, the CIA agent, and directs the film. The cast includes Victor Garber as the Canadian Ambassador Paul Taylor; John Goodman as Hollywood makeup artist John Chambers; Alan Arkin as Hollywood producer Lester Siegel; Bryan Cranston as Tony's CIA boss; and other familiar faces as well.

The film uses archive footage like President Jimmy Carter, Ted Koppel, and others. The film is set during 1979 and 1980. Mendez devises s plan to film scouts in Iran on a scouting location. The film does a terrific job in recreating the escape.

The DVD features one notable feature including the actual people who lived through the great escape from Tehran. Even President Jimmy Carter and Canadian Ambassador Paul Taylor appear to explain the situation. I enjoyed this feature very much.

4863842,5,B005S9ELM6,I love this movie. All the characters are well played and fascinating. I especially liked Alan Arkin and John Goodman. They were great. The film is based on the true story of the American Embassy takeover by Iranian students in 1979. I also remember when these American Embassy employees arrived back in America. What a shock to learn that they were in hiding in the Canadian Embassy all this time. Ben Affleck directed this and he did an excellent job. The tension at the end is palpable. It was a great look into what actually happened to these people. I highly recommend it.,1438128000,,577,4.611650485436893

Proof that truth is stranger than fiction, Argo is a dramatization of the rescue of the Canadian Six from Iran during the revolutionary uprising of 1979. With radical alternatives to save the group dismissed, the best worst idea is employed: pretend the fugitives are shooting a science fiction movie.

What did I think?

This fast-paced thriller puts you, then keeps you, on the edge of your seat  a high accomplishment as we know how it ends. Affleck, cleverly, doesnt identify a specific villain, instead focusing on the retributive predisposition of a people finally freed from their tyrannical ruler, only to inflict their own brand of terror. When faced with a nation of hatred, it makes the planning and execution of this escape even more nail biting. Some are upset the film wavers from the true story but don't worry about that. A highly enjoyable film that dramatizes an already astonishing story.",1431820800,,924,4.98051948051948

4864324,3,B005S9ELM6,"Had to know how to rate this. On the one hand, I'd would like to give it 3.5 stars. It's entertaining. Not great, but as movie-making from the Hollywood cookbook goes, tastier than average. Has a couple of memorable lines, like ""This is the best bad plan we've got.""

On the other hand, I'd like to give it NEGATIVE 3 stars, because it doesn't have the nerve to tell more than about 49% of the truth.

For one thing, while they were remarkably successful in casting actors who look (or were made to look) like their real-life counterparts, Ben Affleck cast himself as Tony Mendez, despite the fact that he doesn't look a thing like Tony Mendez. It's almost a perfect example of the difference between American and British film making: a good British filmmaker would have cast some great actor who has the same troll-doll look that the real Tony Mendez had. A hero who doesn't look like a hero: now THERE's an idea ahead of its time! (The exchange in the movie where the Canadian ambassador is surprised that the Mendez character doesn't look like a ""G-Man"" is amusing Affleck responds politely, ""I think you're thinking of the FBI"" but it's not as funny as it could be, because ""G-Man"" is kind of a synonym of ""hero"" and Affleck looks exactly like a hero. The beard doesn't make him any less of a model and he simply isn't a good enough actor to act as ordinary as the real Mendez must have done.

And they do the same thing with the story. The truth is not so much more complicated that they couldn't have stuck to it  if they'd been willing to jettison the absurd chase scene at the end. I hardly knew how I was supposed to react to the chase scene. Did Affleck know that I already know that it didn't happen and is he cleverly poking fun at himself, as if to say, ""I know this is utterly false but let's do it anyway and we'll all have a good laugh?"" It didn't FEEL that way. Instead it felt to me like the writers thought that, without a final scene with soldiers in a couple of jeeps chasing a jet on the runway, the story just wouldn't be interesting enough, wouldn't ring true. It's an insult to viewers. And to me, it's a sign that the writers have no imagination, that they can't actually take a great story and tell it well. Remember, they didn't have to make this story up at all: they had it handed to them, and then they set about ""improving"" it. They don't even have the basic judgment to recognize a fantastic story when they see it. They even added a totally superfluous, time-wasting clich love story (about the estrangement of Mendez and his wife at the time).

The movie also creates the false impression that the contribution of the Canadians consisted mainly in the ambassador's allowing the six Americans to hide out in his house for a couple of months, when in fact, the Canadians were very actively involved in conning the Iranians. There's almost no hint of that, and that's a shame.

So the facts are wrong, but the scenery and costuming are authentic, and hey, it's goes good with popcorn. Why is it in Hollywood that the only people who actually care about the truth are the makeup artists, set builders and costumers? It's because most of the audience doesn't care about the truth any more than the directors and the writers.",1427155200,5,3254,4.460504201680672

What I didn't realize (or remember), was that 6 of them had escaped, by the Grace of God...  'Argo,' tells the story of those 6 who escaped, and tells how they escaped.  CIA operative, Tony Mendez, placed his life on the line, by making up an elaborate and brilliant scheme, to get the 6 escapees out of Iran.  A husband and wife, from the Canadian Embassy, hid the 6 escapees in their home, for approximately 3 months, also placed their lives on the line.  The movie, as you will see in the end, is very realistic.  It has the same scenes in the movie, as it does in photographs, from that time.  In some of the photographs, I can't tell who is the actor, and who is the escapee, because the makeup was that well done.  I, also, watched the Special Features, which interview some of the real escapees, Tony Mendez and President Jimmy Carter.  I would recommend purchasing this DVD, and I give it 5 Stars (I would give it 10 Stars, but it won't let me)!  It's one of the best films I've seen in a very long time.  It's brilliant...",1426809600,,1476,4.351648351648351

4864645,4,B005S9ELM6,"It's not often a film gets a 5* review from me; there's usually something not quite right or room for improvement. Argo nearly warrants a top star rating. I'm always sceptical about movies nominated for loads of Oscars as often they're just jingoistic flavour-of-the-month or hyped by a well funded PR campaign (witness `The Hurt Locker'). In the case of Argo the recognition of a job well done is mostly deserved. Ben Affleck the actor seems to be improving & maturing with each successive movie, but in his return to directing since the disappointing `The Town' he has taken a refreshingly un-Hollywood approach to attention to detail and production values.

I'm old enough to remember the events first-hand (though admittedly it was a long time and a lot of wine ago) but I was pretty shaky on the detail but the introductory `history lesson' using real and cleverly faked footage from the time made sure that we were fully aware of the context of the crisis. What we, and everybody else at the time, were unaware of was the CIA's and Hollywood's improbable involvement in the repatriation (or `exfiltration' as they seem to call it) of a group of escaped hostages. However, the alleged historical veracity has suffered, as usual, at the hands of the Hollywood machine. Just a brief bit of Google'ing shows how actual events have been subverted by the convenient `based on a true story' subtitle. The role of the British was completely ignored (just what have the Yanks got against us?) and the role of the Canadians was downplayed significantly.

This could have easily been one of those slow, stodgy films that take themselves far too seriously but there's just the right undercurrent of light humour in the Hollywood proceedings and the casting of Alan Arkin and the irrepressibly good humoured John Goodman was inspired. Despite the American penchant for re-writing history for their own shallow glorification this is still a splendidly watchable film and we shall undoubtedly re-watch it many times.",1421452800,,2007,4.970238095238095

4864835,4,B005S9ELM6,"The role of artistic camouflage was central to Ben Affleck's film Argo and the history on which it was based.  Argo is based on the true story of the rescue of six American hostages from the Canadian ambassador's residence in Tehran during the Iranian hostage crisis of the later Carter years.  The central character, portrayed by Ben Affleck, is Tony Mendez, a CIA operative who helped to exfiltrate six Americans from Iran by posing as a film crew scouting out locations for a cheesy science fiction movie called Argo.  Art imitates life, imitating art all for the sake of life.  The heroic and indispensable role of Ambassador Ken Taylor and the Canadians is duly saluted.  The courage of the Canadian Ambassador's Iranian housekeeper, Sahar, provides a welcome counterpoint to the hysterical fervor of the Iranians caught up in their Islamic revolution.  Sahar's role, played by Sheila Vand, is suggestive of millions of Iranians longing for peace and real reform in their benighted country today.

Confronted by the challenge of how to come up with a credible plan to extract six Americans from Iran under the noses of the Iranian Revolutionary guard during the height of the hostage crisis, Tony Mendez turned to an acknowledged expert in camouflage -- Hollywood make-up and design artist John Chambers (1923 -2001). Mendez engaged the Hollywood professional Chambers, played by John Goodman in this film, who created special visual effects for The Outer Limits and Star Trek television series.  John Chambers was  a master of illusion who won the first Oscar ever awarded to a make-up artist for his work on Planet of the Apes.  After serving as a medical technician during World War II, Chambers found employment repairing faces and making prosthetic limbs for wounded veterans at the United States Department of Veterans Affairs hospital in Hines, Illinois.  Chambers, like S.J. Solomon in WWI, made a study of nature in order to perfect his artistic craft.

Affleck's movie is ""based on true events"" but is a work of historic fiction rather than a documentary.  The tarmac chase scene, the tense moments at the airport and the bazaar sequence were all Hollywood additions designed to add dramatic interest to the film--and they succeed.  The Lester Siegel character, played with panache by Alan Arkin, is a fictional character invented wholly invented for the film.

Mendez chose to deploy a strategy of  high-difference, dazzle camouflage that is explicitly NOT about invisibility.  It was about disruption and confusion.  His American hostages would not try to fit in, but rather to be so outlandish that the Iranians would accept the premise of those crazy Canadian/Hollywood types trying to rip off a new Star Wars Persian-style.  If you want to baffle them with bulls__t, then Hollywood is always your very best option.  The Revolutionary Guards' heads are indeed muffled by illusion.

Actors are routinely asked to deceive the public with makeup, costumes and special effects for the purpose of selling tickets or filling seats in a theater.  These are the tricks of the trade.  What an unadulterated joy it is for the Chapman and Siegel characters to have an opportunity to practice their art on the side of the angels in the service of human liberty!

Argo also depicts multiple cultural collisions on several different levels.  America's open democratic society is contrasted with the closed fear-based society of the Ayatollahs' Iran, but the film also features the collision of the buttoned-up CIA and loose-living Hollywood and the collision of the public/political domain with the private world of children and families.

Argo works as a taut well-crafted caper movie.  It is exciting to see those unsung heroes in the shadow world of intelligence receiving some of the recognition that they so richly deserve and to see how the artistry of movie magic or camouflage can sometimes be used for a noble cause.  The MGM slogan was Ars Gratia Artis --""Art for Art's Sake"", in Argo we see ""Art for Man's sake"".

I thought the movie was good, however, I give it a 4 star because you really cant watch it twice.  Many films you can watch the movie several times and still enjoy it but with some films like ARGO and flight-plan once you know the ending, then it takes the excitement out of it.  Through-out the whole film, I kept wondering what will happen to the hostages in IRAN..and that was the main focus of the film.

So overall, if your watching the movie for the first time, then you will enjoy it but I feel watching again kills the intensity.  Its like chewing gum, when you first chew the gum, its has that sweet taste but after 5 minutes or so, the taste goes away.",1414108800,,784,4.091503267973856

4865090,5,B005S9ELM6,"Argo
 Ben Affleck has truly grown into the promise of his spectacular Hollywood debut in the 1997 hit Goodwill Hunting for which he shared an Oscar for writing with his pal Matt Damon.  In the four saw blade Argo Affleck continues his success with The Town (2010) which he also both stared and directed.  Affleck completes the hat trick by also producing Argo, along with George Clooney and others.
 This R rated drama is a true life thriller.  Younger audience members will not personally remember the now historical events depicted in the film.  The Islamic revolution that swept over Iran in 1979 also swept over the US embassy resulting in the illegal captivity of the personal there for over a year.  Argo tells the story of six staffers that fled the embassy and went into hiding at the home of the Canadian Ambassador.  When the staffers escaped we were told only that the Canadians got them out of Iran.  Argo tells the rest of the story.
 CIA man Tony Mendez-whose life and writing forms the basis for the mildly fictionalized movie-has the idea to make a fake Science Fiction movie as a front to slip the staffers out of Iran.  Affleck plays Mendez.  Alan Arkin and John Goodman play the actual Hollywood pros that agree to help make the fake film seem real by setting up a fake office, doing fake publicity events-complete with actors in costume- and otherwise doing what a real film company would be doing.  I love it when Hollywood can make fun of itself which Arkin and Goodman do with gusto.
 The scenes set in the chaos of post revolution Iran are tense, frightening and haunting.  The revolutionaries strung up opponents from construction cranes in the streets of Teheran and left them to dangle, the better to impress the public.  In the post picture credits Affleck shows actual news photos of this and some other events in the film to demonstrate his historical accuracy.  His scene set in the crowded, emotionally electric bazaar is as scary as anything I have seen on film.  It seems that any horror is possible at the drop of a hat and Affleck does it using only tightly packed people and noise, great directing.
 The real life Tony Mendez had a kind of genius and tremendous courage to pull this operation off and this film is a proper tribute to him.  It is also an indictment of those many  places in the world where emotions run amok and life is held to be very cheap.  The film is R rated for some language and horrifyingly realistic street murders by the revolutionaries.
 This movie runs exactly two hours.  With a budget of $44.5 million and an opening weekend take of $20 million word of mouth testimony will have to work well for producer Affleck to make his money back.  My showing was jammed.  This is a worthwhile movie experience for adults and deserves a large audience.",1410739200,2,2808,4.633603238866397

4865126,5,B005S9ELM6,"Argo is based on a true story of the Iranian hostage crisis that took place in late 1979 thru 1981.  Ben Affleck plays the part of Tony Mendez who led the rescue of 6 embassy staff members who were able to escape being taken as hostage.  Affleck also directed the movie.  The cast was in the hundreds.  Though this story took place at a time in my life where I was clueless about what was going on in any part of the world except my own, I was able to follow along with the story because of the brief background leading up to the crisis which is given at the start of the movie.  If you fail to understand this part, you may want to restart the movie and listen to it again as it does help to understand the whole.  I definitely had to listen to it a couple of times.

Affleck was very brave to take upon himself the directing of the show, because to make it interesting to the audience, he had to take some liberties with the exact facts of the event.  He was dealing with a number of countries whose feelings could get bent out of shape if they were projected inaccurately.  I thought Affleck did an incredible job as director.  I see why the movie deserved best picture and feel that Affleck should have also rec'd best director.  Since the movie was only based on a true story, I went to Wikipedia after viewing the movie to read more about the details of the event.  While there I also read about Argo, the movie, where the name came from, and other such details.  This article gave many of the differences between the actual events of the crisis and the movie.  It will be worth your time to read the article also as there really are lots of differences.  I still consider the movie excellent as giving only truth to us would require a lengthy documentary or a book and would not reach such a mass audience.

4865158,2,B005S9ELM6,"This movie combines lazy anti-Muslim stereotyping with Hollywood narcissism and with some really contrived action sequences. In all, it's an unengaging film that is hard to care about.

The movie is about the wildly creative plot by the CIA to evacuate American hostages in Iran by posing them as members of a film crew. While Hollywood just loves to talk about their life on set, I personally hate it because it isn't escapism to hear about the day to day of a film crew, which precious few people across the world work as. Instead, it comes across as navel-gazing.

They spin up the plan, there are a bunch of big swinging dick bureaucrats in the halls of the pentagon or whatever talking tough, which again, is hard to care about. They go to Iran. They deal with the unruly natives, who are going Islamic revolution apes***, and who thus are fanatical and have lost their core of humanity. Then it's a long slog to the airport. Like, if this were a normal person's day, you would have the dark fear music kick in when like he forgets his keys and has to spend twenty minutes searching for it while looking at the clock and hoping that traffic won't be too bad so he isn't late to work. What I mean is that you get the fear music in this movie at the check in counter when they have to race back in Washington at just a seconds' worth of wait to get approval for the tickets, they get talked to by the Islamic TSA, and wonder of wonders, their alibi back in the United States is held up by a B-movie scene, which oh no, is almost lost, they get on the tarmac and literally the fear music kicks in when THE DRIVER HAS TO FIGHT WITH THE TRUCK'S TRANSMISSION.

In short, the dumbest, pettiest events are blown up out of proportion, with the most amazing of coincidences and narrow escapes because...driving to the airport and getting on a plane has to be made exciting somehow.

I heard good reviews, but the critics are wrong. This movie stinks. Stay away.",1409961600,,1956,4.425

In 1980, the tensions between Iran and The United States began, and the U.S. embassy in Tehran was overrun. Hundreds were held hostage for over a year, but six did manage to escape and went into hiding. Knowing that their lives were even more in danger than those of the hostages, the C.I.A. developed a unique plan to get them out of Iran. They sent in one of their top agents, with credentials claiming that he was part of a Canadian film crew. Armed with fake documents, he would smuggled the six out of the country. The film was intense and featured one close call after another, but in reality, getting them out was almost too easy. They were never stopped or questioned, and slipped out under the cover of early morning, without a hitch, but what kind of a movie would that be? Once these classified files were released by the U.S. Government, Hollywood saw the chance to tell this story in an extreme manor, and did so much to the delight of audiences and much to the chagrin of the other countries involved. Ben Affleck both stars and directs this film, and while everyone raves about his performance, I thought it was typically cold and flat. Ben Affleck wasn't interesting, the character he played was. Affleck wasn't any more likeable or skillful here than he was in any other role and that's why he didn't win best actor. I've said it before and I'll say it again, the man is a fantastic Director, but a very mediocre actor. That being said, the extreme locations and huge cast, were his biggest challenge to date as a Director, and I was very impressed by the way he managed to pull it off. Argo is based on a true story, it's fast paced, and even though we all know what happened before seeing the film, it's still an edge of your seat thriller that really shouldn't be missed.",1408838400,,1927,4.4772727272727275

4865480,2,B005S9ELM6,"I honestly don't see the appeal here. Every year I like to see the best picture winner though I haven't seen one in theaters since LOTR: the return of the king. They usually either leave me really impressed or disappointed. This one left me with mixed feelings and just very underwhelmed. This whole idea that this is a comeback for Ben Affleck is just pointless. He's not some sort of top tier actor whose filmography needs to be analyzed and held up high. He's done some decent stuff and some not so decent stuff.

Moving on I find this time period and this incident to be largely uninteresting. Or at least the way it's presented. Nothing about the time period or setting is presented in any memorable way. There's no atmosphere or tone to this film. The characters are all uninteresting and undeveloped. I don't care about any of the characters being held hostage because we don't get to know a single one of them. There's some good actors here but even Affleck is lacking as a leading man. Take a look at his performance. He shows very little emotion. He just seems to be doing business as usual, making me not care about his mission even more. I don't know I just found this to be very boring. The language was also completely unnecessary, tasteless, and not funny.

In closing if this is your type of movie power to you but I need a little more action or a story that's interesting. There are many movies that are driven by dialogue and they don't need action cause they are interesting and character driven. This is not one of those movies to me. It has some good actors, the production is sky high but it lacks soul. I also think it's a mistake to take this movie as the literal truth of the events that took place. Everyone knows Hollywood tends to blow things out of proportion and history should always be questioned and not taken as the complete truth just because someone told you it is. If this story is absolutely true I suppose it's fairly interesting but not in the way it's presented in this movie.",1405209600,,2017,4.478260869565218

4865540,5,B005S9ELM6,"This is my first review of the year 2014. Not the first film I watched this year but the first film I reviewed this year. To a good year in film! I'll say to you that when I heard about this film it was getting praised nonstop from critics. I truly was doubtful, myself that the film was actually anything to gloat about. Sadly, I hadn't had a chance to view the film until the other day. I was completely wrong with my pre-thoughts on the film. It is and will be a masterpiece among modern film. I've already bought a copy of it as well. I guess you could call me a bias person, as when I read 'Ben Affleck' as the lead as well as the director for the film, I was kinda repelled. It's kinda hard to like the dude who brought us 'Daredevil', and a heaping of other pretty bad movies. But now I've gotta say that I'm sorry Ben, I should of stuck in there for you. I mean if Tom Hanks can make a few bad movies and then come back with a bunch of good ones, well so can you Ben. Anyhow onto my review of 'Argo'.

'Argo' follows C.I.A exfiltration specialist Tony Mendez (Played by Ben Affleck) as he creates a fake film to get six embassy staff members out of the country of Iran, during a large Iranian Protest, which resulted in the takeover of the U.S Embassy in Tehran.

The cast of the film is excellent, featuring a turning point in 'Ben Affleck' career. Among the supporting cast we get a solid performance from 'Alan Arkin' playing a character that always seems to be irritated, but as always that kind of character is the perfect fit for Alan. 'John Goodman' plays a makeup artist who assists Tony Mendez creating the fake film, and gives a performance, in which you know John's having fun. And 'Bryan Cranston' is a good fit in the role of Tony's supporter, and supervisor.

The script by 'Chris Terrio' is very intelligent. In that, I mean it finds ways to sneak in darker jokes while managing to not come off as odd and or un-necessary, they provide a small smile, but nothing that would change the ever increasing tension the film presents. The dialogue the script has, never comes off as corny, or cringe worthy, everything sounds as if it was stuff people would actually say, not just words put down to explain what's going on. That's something I liked about the script as well. It never explained the main idea of the plot; it just gave suggestions and let you fill in the rest as the film progressed.

I have to give attention to 'Ben Affleck' for his outstanding directing in the film, if the Academy Awards don't do it. He found an effective way to not only headline the film but direct it as well, which I feel he did a wonderful job doing so, especially for the opening scenes, which were complete madness.

The character development was pretty solid, considering all the madness going on, you'd think you'd never really get to know your characters as anything more than damsel's in distress. But as the film cut to the six embassy people, it showed all their emotions and panic as they slowly broke down. By the end of the day, when the film ends, you really feel for those stranded people, you want them to make it out of that country. And when you start thinking about Tony Mendez, you most definitely want him to make it back to his family, and his lovable kid.

The film expresses a strong sense of urgency and tension. I was seriously at the end of my seat as I watched the six embassy people walk into that airport at the end. Knowing that in a flash they could be discovered and imprisoned, or even worse hanged. I was yelling for somebody to pick up that phone when the Guard makes a call to the fake studio Tony Mendez created. The whole film will have you at the end of your seat, not knowing whether or not the six embassy people will make it back to America or not. All together it makes the film even more exciting then the film already is.

The plot is great. It's never bland or dull. It's always exciting and original, and keeps you watching, as you never know what's happening until it's happened. The plot, is more sophisticated than most popcorn movies but it will never the less entertain you.

If I'd ever seen anything so unique in film it would have to be during the opening protest scenes in this film. When the film starts cutting through the protesters it blends real footage of the actual event into the film, and I found that to be really neat, even if a bit distracting.

The editing was pretty good, not choppy, and it didn't cut from one thing to another in the blink of an eye, it gave you a good 10 seconds or so, then it would move on. It all was easy on you.

The pacing is actually decent; the film takes a rather slow pace to increase tension in the film. Instead of a high paced film, we get a slow one, which spends a lot more time leading up to the final instead of just jumping to it at any chance possible.

All an All 'Argo' is one of those films you just have to love. A film that works hard, and in the end, achieves its goal. 'Argo' is a great film, and deserved the Best Picture award it got at the academy. It just goes to show you not to underestimate someone's credentials on previous failures. Judge a film on its own merits not on previous films. A+

P.S: Ben Affleck has two upcoming features. The first 'Gone Girl' and the second 'Batman vs. Superman'. While I somewhat disagree with Ben's casting on the latter film as Batman, as this film has shown, you can't judge until you see the finished project, so I'll just have to wait for that one until July 2015.",1404691200,,5532,4.308653846153846

It was okay, but the story it is telling is very inaccurate when compared with the actual historical events - responses to this criticism, which said, ""It's meant to be entertainment"" open it up to the other criticism, which is that only the tertiary characters are compelling and Ben Affleck appears to be playing himself, albeit in an unusual situation.

I had great difficulty caring about the main characters. The scenes I thought were strongest were the ones featuring the two Hollywood directors who collaborated in setting up the artificial film - they were excellent!!  And the scenes with the Iranian housekeeper - until the end, you do not know if she is protecting her employers or about to turn them in. I nearly cried at the end, but it was because of the actions of the housekeeper, and not the characters I was supposed to be engaged with.

4865882,5,B005S9ELM6,"The recent attack on the American Consulate in Benghazi Libya gave rise to memories of the siege of our embassy in Tehran in 1979 and the 444 day hostage crisis which ensued. There is a thrilling backstory to that siege that not everyone remembers, when six of the Embassy staffers managed to escape to the streets before the marauding mob was able to fully occupy the Embassy. Those six people took refuge at the home of the Canadian Ambassador to Iran, Ken Taylor, where they stayed hidden, while a desperate and seemingly impossible plot was hatched within the CIA to get them out of Iran safely.

Argo is that story, deftly directed by Ben Affleck, who also stars as the real-life rescuer, Tony Mendez. We have seen Affleck evolve over the years, from when he and his then-unknown screenwriting sidekick, Matt Damon, first gained a foothold in Hollywood with their screenplay for Good Will Hunting, which remains, in my opinion, Damon's best work to date. Affleck's career sputtered during various dalliances, resulting in screen work so mediocre that he won The Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor four years in a row, and deservedly so. But he began to regain his footing in 2010's The Company Men and The Town, and now, with Argo, he has achieved brilliant maturity, both as an actor, and also as a first-rate director.

He took full command as lead actor due mostly due to his looks, referring not to his physical features alone, but also, his silent presence in several scenes in which not a word was spoken, as he ""looked"" out upon the situation and conveyed the full meaning with those ""looks"" alone  superb acting in itself. George C. Scott pulled off that same talent marvelously in one brief scene in a tent in Oklahoma Crude, and James Mason, with a simple passing glance at a cohort, summed up the full intent of why he assigned George Peppard to fly the new untried monoplane in the concluding scene of The Blue Max. It is a rare talent and the mark of a great actor. Ben Affleck now inhabits those ranks.

The cast of Argo is rounded out with the Hollywood insider savvy of Alan Arkin, who takes on agent Richard Kind slap-for-slap in an insult contest, Victor Garber as the venerable Canadian ambassador, reaffirming, in my estimation, why Canada is one of the most civilized nations on Earth.

I liked fiction and non-fiction, but these true stories gave me a view of the world I lived in, not the one I hoped for. Argo gave that treat. The dangerous times of hatred and fear were detailed. Every step was detailed. The eyes of strangers were detailed and their seeming innocuous nature, but yet... Suspense was gripping. Lives of ordinary people just doing their jobs but dropped into a maelstrom not of their making made the terrifying nature of fear and trust and consequences come very real. I wish people would just get along, but they don't always; I wish that the kinder nature of religion would help us rise, but sometimes it doesn't.

4866168,4,B005S9ELM6,"Despite being told I just have to see Argo back when it came out in 2012, I bought it on DVD a month ago when it was on sale and didn't crack the wrapper to watch it until last weekend. I hadnt forgotten about it and thought, Score! I totally have something to watch now.
Not really. I was just too lazy to leave my apartment to go to the Family Video. But after all, Argo couldn't be too bad. It won three Oscars and was nominated for several other awards.
I started the movie, and as the previews were playing, I was expecting it to be action packed with lots of computer-generated imagery--a movie my boyfriend would have eventually begged me to watch anyway. However, Argo was not at all what I had expected, and soon I was no longer so captivated by the two-day-old Chinese food I had been scarfing.
Of course, Ben Affleck just had to be the star of a movie he directed. Not to discredit Afflecks acting, because he certainly appeared to be a good fit for the role of CIA agent Tony Mendez. In the movie, Mendez is recently separated from his wife, living a bachelor lifestyle, and trying to keep in touch with his son.
The film is set in 1979 during the time of the Iranian Hostage Crisis. After the American Embassy was invaded, six embassy employees escaped and came under the care of the Canadian Ambassador, Ken Taylor, played by Victor Garber.
Mendez concocts a plan to bring them home by forming a movie production company to scout out a site for a film in Iran. The escapees will pretend to be a part of the production companys troupe. Mendez recruits the help of film veterans John Chambers (John Goodman) and Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) to run the production company and form the alias the escapees will have to play to escape Iran.
The movie they are pretending to shoot is entitled, Argo, a sci-fi set in the Middle East. Although the plan has little chance of succeeding, Mendez CIA superiors give it the go ahead.
After Mendez has traveled to Iran and trained the six escapees, teaching them what they will have to do and who they will have to pretend to be, the CIA aborts the mission. But Mendez decides to go ahead with the plan anyway. Before leaving to pick up the escapees and head to the airport, he makes a call to his supervisor (Brian Cranston) and tells him that he will not leave the escapees in Iran. He plans to continue with the mission.
There is a lot of edge-of your-seat drama and great acting in this movie, making it difficult to take your eyes off the screen. While Mendez is telling the escapees what they must do, there is a lot of intensity. The escapees think the plan is half-baked and they may never return home.
One particularly exciting scene was one in which Mendez takes the escapees to a film festival in Iran where they are to act their new alias. A protest in the street holds them up, and protesters bang on the car and yell at the Americans. The scene depicts the feelings of the escapees well. The fear is shown on their faces as they try not to look at the people pounding their fists into the car. Mendez does his best to get through the crowd and reassure the escapees.
There is also great chemistry between Chambers (Goodman) and Siegel (Arkin). They play great humanitarians, and their parts, although small, make a huge impact in the film. These characters also provide some comic relief to an otherwise serious movie.
Brian Cranston, who plays a CIA supervisor to Mendez, also gives a great performance in this movie. At the end of the movie, before Mendez gets to the airport with the escapees, Cranston is in a mad dash to get the tickets for the reserved airline so they will not be held up at the airport and found out.
From what I read about this movie, it was not completely accurate historically, but it is still worth watching. Argo puts a story to the brief synopsis of the Iranian Hostage Crisis that everyone got in their high school history curriculum. The dramatization of the event shows the emotions of those in America and the people taken hostage in Iran.",1396310400,,4034,4.467479674796748

I don't think you'll give a rats ass about any of them.  It that sort of film.  Americans good, Iranians bad.

4866269,5,B005S9ELM6,"I am a sort of a movie buff but no guru by any means. I've never been a huge fan of Ben Affleck, but he can definitely direct; from ""Good Will Hunting,"" to ""The Town,"" and now this, he's definitely showed he knows what he's doing behind the camera. The suspense and pace of the movie keep up throughout, and you really get a good feel for the dark, disturbing atmosphere those poor souls went through when it really happened. Alan Arkin is always a joy to have in a movie, and John Goodman is an incredible actor. Not to mention ""Breaking Bad"" star Bryan Cranston, who, though not having tons of screen time, still manages to knock it out of the park. The movie isn't totally action-packed, but it is incredibly suspenseful and absolutely worth watching. I can't recommend buying the movie though simply because it was a little disturbing, so watching it multiple times just isn't appealing. ""Argo"" falls into that category with movies such as ""Platoon"" or ""The Kingdom,"" in that at the end you go, ""Wow, that was a really powerful film and amazingly well done. I never want to watch it again."" So to recap, the movie is a fantastic film, but not completely worth purchasing.",1393891200,,1175,4.57345971563981

Less any factual discrepancies, this film is brilliantly done. The acting, directing, production, and writing is spot on! Ben Affleck shines in his lead role! There is enough historical information for a viewer to understand the gist of the events and what occurred to free the hostages. Though it was undoubtedly done with a swing to the American efforts, as well as the United States' role in getting the hostages home safely, it is accurate enough to deduce the timeline of events that actually occurred.

From the truth-is-stranger-than-fiction file comes Argo, a movie based on a true-life story so unlikely and improbable that it could never have sprung full-blown from the mind of a screenwriter. And if it did, it would certainly never have been green-lit by any self-respecting studio. That it WAS based on a true story made it possible for director Ben Affleck to bring it to the screen and to win a Best Picture Oscar for his efforts.

The saga of Argo begins in the fall of 1979, when, in response to President Carters providing sanctuary for the deposed Shah, anti-Western demonstrators stormed the American embassy in Tehran, capturing and holding sixty-some-odd foreign service workers there as hostages for 444 days. However, unbeknownst to the Iranians - and virtually everyone else in the world - six of the people working in the compound managed to escape to the Canadian embassy, where they spent the next several months in hiding. When the state department finally learned of their presence there, a plot was hatched to get them out and to safety. And this is where things really got weird. It was CIA operative Tony Mendez (played by Affleck) who came up with the bizarre, longest-of-long-shots plan to pose as a Hollywood filmmaker scouting locations for a sci-fi epic he hoped to shoot in that country, passing off the six embassy staff as his crew. In order to pull off the ruse - one fraught with untold risk and peril for all concerned - Mendez enlisted members of the movie industry as co-conspirators and allies, some cognizant of the truth but most not. Argo was the actual script that Mendez found lying in a pile of discards and around which he wove an elaborate hoax, even going so far as to take out ads in the trade papers in case the Iranians needed a little convincing that everything was indeed on the up-and-up. Like a modern-day Henry Higgins with the lives of six innocent people at stake, Mendez had to train these bureaucrats to act, speak and behave like a movie crew or face possible execution if their true identities were discovered. It was truly a special op to end all special ops, though the full truth of it remained hidden until the mission was finally declassified in 1997.

The screenplay by Chris Terrio mines a rich vein of dark humor as it juxtaposes the kitschiness and cheesiness of early 80s moviemaking against the backdrop of a life-and-death real-world event. John Goodman plays makeup artist John Chambers and Alan Arkin portrays film producer Lester Siegel, two of the Hollywood bigwigs whose professional expertise was instrumental in securing freedom for the group. Bryan Cranston (with a full head of hair) and the seemingly ubiquitous Kyle Chandler (having also appeared in the similar Zero Dark Thirty) provide some of the more familiar faces in a large and impressive cast.

Theres breath-bating suspense as Mendez shepherds his crew past one security checkpoint after another with the Iranian authorities in hot pursuit. Will they make it to the plane on time, and, once aboard, will they be able to reach freedom or will they be somehow thwarted in their effort?

As with most movies based on true events, Argo faced its share of criticism from a predictable chorus of nitpicking naysayers for fudging some of the facts and for over-dramatizing the beat-the-clock nature of the narrative. Well, get over it, folks; this is a movie, and, as such, a certain amount of dramatic license must be afforded the storytellers in pursuit of their art. And art it turns out to be, a canny combination of social drama and pulse-pounding thriller than never fails to astonish and entertain.",1393459200,,3650,4.880645161290323

4866314,5,B005S9ELM6,"Before I watched the movie I read a review that said You know exactly what will happen at the end but you are still anxious with uncertainty. This turned out to be very true. I love period pieces that happen in our recent past, a time that I can vaguely recall, because it invokes a sense of nostalgia. Argo takes place at the end of 1979 and the beginning of 1980 when Iran had their revolution and removed the Shah that the U.S. put in place with a ruler of their own choosing. Iran was extremely upset with the U.S. and U.K. because they believed we were exporting their oil and leaving them a ruler who cared only for his own lavish lifestyle and nothing for the poor that composed the majority of the country. The movie sheds light on our current problems with Iran and the bitter animosity their people holds for our country.

The movie begins with Iranians overrunning the U.S. embassy and taking hostage most of the works but 5 were able to flee and hide in the Canadian embassy. The U.S. were afraid that if these 5 were found out that they would be killed and hatched a farfetched plot to have Tony Mendez extract them by posing as a scout for a science fiction film. The acting was superb by Afflect and the 5 hostages. They were able to capture the tension of the place and time as well, as well as the struggle to get out of the country. The dialogue was realistic and the music and set design made the whole thing feel very real.",1392595200,,1443,4.305147058823529

Notable are the humorous moments by the two movie producers played by John Goodman and Alan Arkin.  Alfred Hitchcock often observed that the audience is entitled to some humorous relief as was often the case in his many fine pictures.

The suspense of the finale of ""Argo"" is almost unbearable.  The spectacular side shot of the 747 airliner rotating for takeoff with the authorities in their ground vehicles chasing it in the foreground must have been a process shot, but it is most convincing and exciting.

This is film that can be enjoyed repeatedly and benefits greatly from the visual and audio benefits of  Blu-ray.",1392508800,,705,4.882352941176471

And, as in Argo, when it's based on a true story it makes it even more suspenseful. I don't know what the Academy was thinking in 2012 when they did not elect Ben Affleck as best director. And the movie won an Academy Award.

Especially interesting to me was how well they matched all the suits, styles, and even furniture of the day.

4866397,5,B005S9ELM6,"If I could give this movie 10 stars I certainly would.  It is excellent entertainment based on real events which were finally de-classified by President Clinton. The story has been fictionalized for purposes of entertainment, dramatic effect, simplification of too many complex details but gives the viewer a great film with historic significance.  Ben Affleck co-produced, directed, and stars in this film and I certainly have an increased appreciation for his skills. He plays CIA agent Tony Mendez who is able to get 6 US embassy employees out of Iran in the early stages of the Islamic revolution that overthrew the Shah. The scenes of the revolutionary crowds invading the US embassy are hair-raising. These 6 individuals found shelter in the home of the Canadian ambassador.  He and his wife were incredibly brave souls to risk their lives in such a way. Alan Arkin and John Goodman are superb as Hollywood veteran film-makers who assist in the charade that must be constructed to convince the Iranians that a Canadian film crew has come to Iran to scout out the locations of a science fiction film. Akin and Goodman have the best lines in the film and offer great comic relief throughout this intense drama. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and White House Chief of Staff Hamilton Jordan are also portrayed for the roles they took in this drama. There are so many films being made today with completely over-the-top computer generated special effects and yet this film succeeds wildly by using the time proven strategies of character development and identification, increased tension with primary characters overcoming one barrier after another, and periodic breaking of the tension with comic relief.

There's almost nothing new to be found here, everything seems a little bit forced, artificial, thus the experience becomes artificial and forced. It's a been there seen that kind of situation.
The performances are solid and the direction is if nothing steady but nothing daring like for example Munich which is a masterpiece and Argo obviously drew inspiration from that superior film by Steven Spielberg (telling is the acceptance speech by Affleck that mentioned Spielberg).
I certainly don't understand how this film could've become such a phenomenon because for me there are far more interesting and captivating films in this genre.
Argo is an O.K. film, don't get me wrong, but not by any chance is it a memorable, lasting film. It was the huge pressure by the studio in my opinion that this movie got the best film Oscar. Because it's mediocre at best.

How indeed!  It was a clandestine operation that shows true genius and incredible courage on the part of all involved - and it plays out on the screen with such precision the viewer is totally caught up in the drama.

It's a plot unlike any other you have ever seen - and highlights the great exploits of the CIA (Christians In Action) in the name of freedom and liberty.

4866645,4,B005S9ELM6,"What makes this movie such an interesting watch for my generation is that it revisits the Iranian hostage taking incident of 1980 and completes the story from the US perspective. Up till now, we were led to understand that it was by Canadian Ambassador Taylor's initiative that six American diplomats were secreted out to safety through its ambassadorial channels. That was only part of the bigger story that Hollywood got around to telling long after the CIA Iranian file was declassified in the late nineties. While Canada's role is still acknowledged as critical to the success of the plan, the filmmaker felt that it was time Americans got to learn about its contribution to the mission. Sure, there was a lot of chest-thumping in the movie as Hollywood and the CIA collaborated to set up a phony movie shoot that would take a small crew inside Iran to effect the escape. The film covers the main events of this venture from the original hostage-taking, to the designing and hatching of the plan, to the role the Canadians played, to the many close calls at the airport before the Swissair jet finally took off. This was one CIA mission that achieved what it set out to do: outsmart the enemy in their own backyard. As a Canadian, I am still proud, after these many years, of the role Taylor and his colleagues had in delivering these men and women from imminent danger during some very volatile times when being an American could cost you your life. This is a movie made for those whose interest lies in making sense of geopolitical intrigues",1388534400,,1547,4.712177121771218

I remember the pictures that they showed on the news of the hostages being paraded through the streets when this event occured.

Brilliant plan even if it was the best bad plan they had.  As a rule I don't watch a lot of the special features that are included with movies I purchase.  This one I did watch the special features.

4866758,5,B005S9ELM6,"Argo is a great example of how out of the box thinking can sometimes succeed.  Having served two tours as a defense attach (Dhaka and New Delhi) and thus knowing how an embassy works, I found the movie to be engaging and entertaining.
I do have a few minor criticisms, however.  When I heard during the movie that the Brits and Kiwis had turned away the six Americans, I could not believe it and later learned that assertion was factually incorrect.  I thought the language was over the top.  As a senior officer, I attended a lot of high level meetings in which participants would occasionally use earthy language but never anything approaching the F-bombs that were routinely dropped by senior officials in the movie.  I also thought it was highly unrealistic that Tony Mendez would be driving in Tehran, a city he hardly knew.
If I had it do all over again, I would have watched the special feature on the DVD, Rescued from Terror, We Were There.  It gave important background information that would have enhanced my viewing of the movie.",1387324800,,1041,4.66120218579235

4866763,4,B005S9ELM6,"Starring Ben Affleck, directed by Ben Affleck, music by Alexandre Desplate and produced by Grant Heslov, George Clooney and Ben Affleck.

Winner of three Academy Awards and over thirty prestigious awards across the world, the film portrays a real event that took place in 1979-80 wherein six American diplomats are rescued in a dramatic way, from Iran, under the disguise of a film unit, said to be making an imaginary science fiction movie named Argo.

Iranian revolutionaries in 1979, hold all American nationals from its embassy as hostages, killing some of them, demanding extradition of the Shah, the former tyrant ruler of Iran, taking refuge in USA. Six of the embassy diplomats escape and hide in Canadian ambassadors residence.
Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), a CIA consultant, is deputed to Iran, to rescue the six American diplomats. Tony designs a plot to extradite the diplomats claiming them as a film production unit, exploring the location, to make a science fiction film. Their passports are faked with Canadian identities, with the help of Canadian ambassador, and all necessary arrangements of floating a fake production unit for the film is done meticulously, with the help of Hollywood studios and of course aided by the US Government. The tension mounts when they are stopped by the Iranian revolutionaries in the airport and thoroughly questioned about their identities. The last second clearance of their departure and the final take off of their flight from the Iranian territory back home safely ends the movie with a happy note. Tony gets the highest Excellence award from the CIA for his daring efforts and gets back to his family.

The movie pumps adrenaline in the second half when the diplomats leave the Canadian ambassadors home to airport. The audience gets really tensed to see how Tony gets them out of the Revolutionary controlled international airport of Iran. The huge relief obtained after the safe take off after a highly nerve cracking security check at the airport is absolutely mind blowing. But none of the six, except one, is shown to thank Tony, for his deadly rescue operation.

The negative part of the film is that the activists and the movement in Iran at that time is shown as extremism and highly unsafe for any American national in the country, which may not be the actual scenario. The basic movement and sentiment of the country seems to have been degraded and fear creating for any potential foreign visitor.

My rating is 3.75/5",1386979200,,2481,4.9975786924939465

4866823,2,B005S9ELM6,"man you can literally hear Hollywood patting itself on the back in this movie.

Technically, it's a good movie. Good shots, well paced, does a good job with showing a complicated idea and issue into an exciting thriller. EXCEPT ALMOST NONE OF IT HAPPENED THAT WAY IN REAL LIFE.

They got the basic frame of the story and then jazzed it up with typical Hollywood hoopla. I wasn't thrilled that they whitewashed the main character (growing a beard does not make you Hispanic, Affleck), but fine, that's Hollywood. It's irritating though, especially *Spoiler alert after this* at the end where we have the ""big scary bearded"" Iranian police smelling a rat in their identities. BUT WAIT! It's up to Hollywood, (again) to save them by covering for them when the police call the main characters production company. Arrgh. Oh, and Affleck has to tell the policemen the plot of their fake! movie which is a pretty much direct rip off of Star Wars and the movie really hammers in the Iranian's emotional connection to a story of an oppressed (gasp) people who rose up and overthrew their evil overlord. JUST LIKE YOUR SHAH!!11 DO YOU GET IT? Super frustrated when I looked up how things really went down and it turned out that they left the country without incident, first of all. Plus they skipped over completely on the team that wrote the script (awesome legends like Ray Bradbury btw) and instead of ~*dramatic tension*~ shots of an angry mob of Iranians pounding on the nice white CIA agent's van, I would have preferred to see more about how those guys actually worked their butts off to make the Argo production a success.

Oh well. It made money, it won the oscar. You'll enjoy it if you turn your brain off and just want an high-quality produced popcorn movie. As for me, personally, I thought the actual events were a lot more exciting and interesting and this film doesn't do those people's lives justice. Guess I'll just read the book.",1385942400,2,1938,4.694117647058824
4866824,4,B005S9ELM6,"In spite of some significant deviations from historical fact, none of which change the basic story, this film well-cast film is both suspenseful and exciting. It's refreshing to see Federal employees portrayed as competent professionals rather than the dupes or villains in some ridiculous conspiracy. Ben Affleck's understated performance as a CIA operative offers a rare look at the real world of overseas intelligence work, rather than the Mission Impossible fantasy world so loved by Hollywood. All in all, this is a fine film that creates a real sense of the period and a crisis that shaped America for the last decade of the Cold War.",1385942400,,640,5.047169811320755

4866857,2,B005S9ELM6,"Argo is a work of fiction and as such is entertaining and worth watching..........

However Argo travels far from the truth or actual facts of this dangerous mission to rescue American citizens who were hiding out and under the protection of the ""Canadian Ambassador"" in Iran, Ken Taylor.

 Risking his life, he requested and received full co-operation from the Primeminister of Canada Joe Clark, who in spite of the extreme dangers that the Canadian Government and their people in Iran would be placed under during the hostage crisis in IRAN gave the ""GO A HEAD."" The Canadians played more than a major role in this dramatic rescue....

President Jimmy Carter President of the United States at the time, praised Ken Taylor and the Canadian Government for their actions stating that, ""Taylor orchestrated the entire process. Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor was the true heroe and that ""Ben Affleck's"" character in Argo, was only in Iran a day and a half.""

President Ronald Reagan who followed President Carter in the White house, presented the Congressional Gold Medal to Kenneth Taylor the above mentioned former Canadian Ambassador to Iran. for his bravery and help. ""

""Mrs. Taylor is also here"" continued The President, ""and was directly involved with her husband in this deed,"" .

President Reagan went on to outline the story of those dangerous days and expressed repeated thanks to Ken Taylor and the Canadian Government for the major role they played.... President Reagan gave a blow by blow very true historic discription of the Hostage crisis. It did not resemble Ben Affleck's ""Argo.""

You may wish to look up the true facts of this story as articulated by both President Jimmy Carter and President Ronald Reagan...

 google--- Canadian rescue Iran Hostage crisis--- Look for the remarks of both Carter and Reagan......

4866860,3,B005S9ELM6,"As some have pointed out, this is a fairly good movie although it is difficult to understand how it won so many awards and received such acclaim.
Perhaps it is the politics of Hollywood that helped this film win so many awards.
Perhaps the most dissapointing aspect of the the film is how some viewers may be misled to think this is an accurate telling of the Canadian Caper.
Yes, being a movie it is understood that some creative license will be used, but as far as historically accurate, ARGO is loosely, loosely based on real events.
2 big historical errors - The 6 escapees were never in great risk where they were hiding. They were in a relatively safe home with access to an outdoor courtyard and when they actually went to fly out of the country, no Iran security even gave them a second look.
Ben Affleck's character in real life was actually only in Iran for about 1 day as an assistant to the Canadian Ambasador.
The Canadians actually spearheaded most of this mission, but the movie makes it look like it was a super secret CIA led operation.

So it one watches the movie and keeps in mind it is loosely, loosely, loosely based on real events and is not an attempt to tell a historically accurate version of what happened, it is entertaining",1385596800,,1252,4.491228070175438

4866920,4,B005S9ELM6,"I found ""Argo"" to be well-directed and acted, satisfying in a technical sense but oddly flat emotionally. Perhaps what is missing is a clear sense of the totalitarian ruthlessness of the Ayatollah Khomeni regime and the extent of the danger threatening the escapes should they be caught. Were the producers concerned lest they ""offend"" certain parties? Whatever the case, even with the outcome known in advance ""Argo"" should have delivered more suspense.",1384905600,,454,5.319444444444445

However, this is an amazing piece of film-making that is totally worth watching over and over again (I've already watched it twice since getting this DVD a week ago.)  And the film is accurate enough to get me interested in researching the whole Canadian Caper.  Whether this picture would motivate you to be studious like that or not is ultimately irrelevant.  I am recommending this DVD because the story is inspiring and the film is amazing...it totally earned that Best Picture Oscar, especially considering its stiff competition.

To some degree, that's the benefit of a film like Argo - it tells a great story, in the context of a recent event, and leaves you with some insight into what actually happened around it.  Ben Affleck is great as Tony Mendez, the CIA extraction specialist with nerves of steel.  Bryan Cranston is also excellent as his mercurial boss, but his Hollywood allies, played by Alan Arkin and John Goodman, make this improbable story believable.  Definitely the Best Picture of 2012.",1384300800,,640,4.738738738738738

This is an important movie about what can be done even when hope seems distant. Man's powers of thought and creativity are often amazing.
Good location feel, pics are good, acting is done well and the lines are good. As I do not know the full true story so I can only surmise that the movie does a good replication of the event without giving away too many state secrets.

4867018,5,B005S9ELM6,"Ben Affleck elevates himself to a director of substance with Argo who can deliver a heartelt and plot-driven story without skipping the human drama. Affleck's direction makes us really emphasize will all the emotions the Americans endure throughout the movie: the boredom, the helplessness, the desire to show themselves and get it over with just to escape the tension -- all these give the main character, Mendez, a ticking clock in addition to providing natural suspense that Affleck knows how to heighten at exactly the right moments. The real key to the movie's (and Affleck's) success here is that he manages to lay out a story of surprising complexity in a simple way that anyone can follow.

The Blu-ray brings with it the strong picture and sound clarity that are only fitting for a Best Picture winner. The package also contains special features including a Picture-in-Picture feature containing interviews from most of the major players (including Mendez, then-President Jimmy Carter and former hostages), a documentary with more interviews, and two additional documentaries covering the films devotion to authenticity.

I remember watching ""The Jackal"" about the assassination attempt of Charles De Gaulle, and feeling equally empty. Whenever a movie attempts to create a thriller about events already played, the result is a shell of events that cannot be convincing towards whatever theme intended. We already know the outcome, so why are the creators pretending to surprise us? How harrowing can known events be? I think a more creative way of designing this movie would be to re-design it like a documentary, almost like an ongoing news cast with the events and players being swept up in the timeline. This movie was just plain anemic. I suppose if you're a really dumb, uninformed and manipulable person, your brain might be slightly charged, and if so, then I blame you for providing inspiration for those who made this piece of crap.

I have no idea why such a bad movie got 7 points on imdb. Possibly, due to patriotic feelings gently patting  our subconscious  and reminding us how much our enemies hated us back at those times. This movie is bad. Why? The movie is full of fictious mistakes; such as a revolutionary guard running to inform his comrades at the airport instead simply given them a call or a character entering the blue mosque in istanbul but then ending up inside hagiasophia. Flight tickets ordered from cia headquarter appears at a computer screen at the tehran airport just  at the moment a staff searches for passenger names a second time (year 1980)... Moreover, Ben Affleck, being the director, spent at least 10 minutes to show his own face (close shots) and occasional few  shots revealing his upper body.  You will see too many unnecessary and childish in the nick of time events, too. Although, the story is nice and based on a real event, the screenplay is like high school play. It's full of cliches.

Out of four of us who agreed to rent this together, NONE of us had the energy to sit through more than 30 minutes.  I don't typically just turn off movies I rent, but this one was THAT annoying.  Please, DO NOT believe this movie as history.  It's a sensational desperate attempt for Affleck to reinvigorate his otherwise sad career.

The acting is good but the film structure has a lot to answer for. I think they put in the standard character conflicts to punch up the story.

It is the Iranian revolution. In the chaos six U.S. Embassy people escape to the Canadian embassy. Now the problem is how to extricate them before they are detected and dispatched. ""To this day, this story stands as an enduring model for international cooperation between governments.""

So an ersatz movie company for a film called ""Argo"" is formed. We listen to lots of talk and a few dispatches. Yet the story progresses ever so slowly.

As Tom Stoppard, author of ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead"" writes ""In a tragedy even minor characters die.""",1379721600,,813,4.704225352112676

4867105,4,B005S9ELM6,"Based on true facts from the takeover of the American embassy in Iran in which hostages were held for 444 days!  Six Americans managed to sneak out of the embassy during the takeover.  They approached the embassy's of two other countries (being turned away by each) before being taken in and hidden by the Canadians.  Their lives are still in danger, however, because pictures of them which had been shredded were slowly being taped back together and soon their identities would be known by the Iranians.  Ben Affleck plays Tony Menendez, a CIA operative, who comes up with an idea on how to get them out (""the least bad idea"")...by making up a phony movie being produced by a real movie production company and sending over ""location scouts"" to Iran.  Tensions run so high in so many different ways.  Will the Americans be able to memorize every detail of their cover stories in one day?  Will they be stopped because of the faulty paperwork at the airport?  Will their identities be discovered?

The pacing of the movie is so well done.  Bryan Cranston, Ben Affleck, John Goodman and many others give great performances while the pacing of the movie keeps tension levels high.  A FUN movie!",1379635200,,1191,4.733009708737864

I could accept the mind numbing sameness of this venture if it didn't play so fast and loose with the truth.  It's a totally disingenuous diatribe whose clear intent is to exonerate the bumbling Carter administration whose impotence was never more apparent than in the Iran hostage crisis.  The makers many sins include diminishing the role of the Canadians in facilitating the escape of the six hostages, slandering the Australian government, and omitting that on the day the remaining hostages were released was when Ronald Reagan was sworn in.

4867107,5,B005S9ELM6,"I first saw this movie when it was released to the pay-per-view channels & I thought........ehh it's OK. Then it hit HBO & I watched it again. And again. AND again. Each time I saw more & more layers to the plot, the acting,the Directing, the wardrobe, the music.........it's a very enjoyable movie about a very horrible event. Is it completely historically accurate? No. But it captures the mood & the emotions that surronded this hostage drama. It would be difficult to make a movie about a group of people trapped in a house for months, hoping they won;t be caught or executed (or kill each other from the closeness & tension).So scenes were added & conjecture has its place. Ben is supposed to be a low key but intense kind of guy. You don;t do what he did for the CIA if you are an emotional showy kinda guy. That gets you killed. That gets your people killed. So his acting was spot on for the role. All of the supporting actors are good. And there is a surprising amount of humor in the movie -- as in real life you cannot deal with such awfulness without some sense of humor or the absurd. So the movie felt ""real"". Many such stories leave out all humor and that simply isn;t how people survive. It may be ""black"" humor but it is humor nonetheless. Of course the HollyWood scenes lend themselves best to the humor & the Political scenes lend themselves best to the absurd (that hasn't changed)but even with the hostages -- a simple line here and there makes the case for how people use humor to cope. So I went from thinking this would be a 3 star review to a 5 star because it got better w/ each viewing.

4867135,1,B005S9ELM6,"I didn't get Argo at all.  I'm aware of the situation involving 6 Americans being held hostage in the late 70's by the Iranian hostage crisis, but what I either didn't know or what is most likely false for the sake of Hollywood movie writing exaggeration, are the segments about film making concerning science fiction and in particular, Planet of the Apes, robots and aliens.  This portion of the movie -which incidentally dominates the entire first half- was really hard to understand.  Totally downright confusing, in fact.  Its inclusion is really perplexing and odd.  I certainly don't remember reading about any of *this* in the history books, haha.  Argo makes viewers unsure if they're supposed to learn about a real incident that took place, or take the entire movie as tongue in cheek.  At least we don't actually SEE aliens and robots.  Imagine how unbelievably awkward that would have been.

At least it begins to make sense near the end when the group of Americans disguise themselves as Canadians to try and rescue the 6 American hostages.  That makes sense.  Nice touch when the group learns about Canada enough to make their Canadian portrayal seem believable.  Not sure how much of this film is total exaggeration though- that's the biggest problem I have with the film.  I don't like being played a fool trying and figure out what is realistic and what is not, of course.  If this is supposed to be some kind of sophisticated version of Abe Lincoln: Vampire Hunter by combining reality with fantasy, please Hollywood, go away forever.

The biggest problem however, is that Argo never even tries to be captivating or tell an interesting story.  Instead it goes for short bits of information that goes by without any suspense or drama, and makes the entire movie feel more like a news broadcast. That kills any momentum the movie tries to build right there, and makes Argo an incredibly overrated movie.  Not worthy of all the accolades it has won over the year.  It's only regarded so highly because of the many big name actors and actresses that star in it.",1378512000,7,2074,4.794366197183098

But if you already own the original blu-ray release, then is it worth an upgrade? Well, hopefully the details below will help you make a decision.

Included on the blu-rays:
- Theatrical Edition of the movie
- Extended Edition of the movie (an extra 10 minutes added to the film)
- 3 New Special Features + all the special features from the previous blu-ray release

Included in the box set:
- 40-page book premium featuring behind the scenes photos, production notes, bios and more
- Argo One-Sheet Poster (you know they are going to fold it to fit it in the box, so it will have creases right down the middle)
- Map of Tehran movie locations (14"" x 20"")
- Reproduction of Tony Mendez's CIA ID card

So if you enjoyed the movie, then you might want to consider picking this up. I'm interested in seeing if the extra 10 minutes of footage improves the film (not that it needs improvement); and with three all-new special features and the book/memorabilia from the film, this set might be worth it.

I guess you need a Bond movie budget like ""Casino Royale"" later Miami Airport scenes to get that right. Nonetheless, Ben Affleck at his best with a lesser known cast all convincing in their roles.

This movie needlessly ignored/diminished Canada's role, and it added some scenes for dramatic effect that weren't true- but the story was dramatic enough as it actually unfolded! I guess I'd rather put historical realism before making a few extra dollars....",1377475200,,360,5.333333333333333

4867253,4,B005S9ELM6,"On November 4, 1979, the American embassy in Iran is stormed and held hostage by a large group of activists, all of whom are upset that the Iranian shah, a man with little support in Iran, was held asylum in the United States during the Iranian Revolution. This was a time that led to major anti-American sentiment in Iran, and it was not a safe place to be. Thanks to the Canadian government, six of the members of the embassy were granted a chance to stay safely within the home of ambassador Ken Taylor while the American CIA (and I believe Canadian government) tried to find a way to get these six people out safely. What follows is a tense thriller, one where the audience is left on the edge of their seat despite knowing the way it all ends (surprise, surprise, non-historians, they do get saved). ""Argo"" is a movie that can be argued to deserve the Best Picture award.

Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) is a CIA ex-filtration specialist, assigned to evacuate six U.S. citizens out of Iran. After failing to come up with many ideas, he gets a sudden inspiration thanks to his son and ""Battle for the Planet of the Apes"". His idea is to create a fake sci-fi movie called ""Argo"", and that him and the six citizens would all be members of the crew going to Iran on a location scout. He gains the assistance of award-winning make-up artist John Chambers (John Goodman) and director Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), as well as fellow CIA worker Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston). Eventually, he brings this to the six members (played by Tate Donovan, Clea DuVall, Christopher Denham, Scoot McNairy, Kerry Bish, and Rory Cochrane), who must learn their characters within a day so they can escape believably through the heavily guarded airport.

This is a film that definitely rides on its cast. ""Argo"" contains a large ensemble cast, filled with famous actors playing a variety of roles. Affleck, Cranston, Goodman, and Arkin are just a few of the big names tied to this film, and part of the fun in the movie is seeing what famous actor will show up in the movie. This cast is famous for a reason, too, as every actor plays their part well, even the possibly less known actors. Affleck works very well as a trustworthy character (which is in fact one of the major themes of the movie) thanks to his performance, and some of the movie's greatest moments are because of him and his character. The six civilians all are well-acted, too, with their character arc and success at the end of the movie creating not only much of the tension, but a thoroughly heartwarming ending. Sure, the ending isn't a surprise, and it shouldn't be, but the acting and writing of the characters into a likeable group go a long way towards you becoming invested in their success. John Chambers and Lester Siegel are just a delight to the movie (played excellently by Goodman and Arkin), providing a much needed humor to the mix. Lastly, Bryan Cranston gets a moment, too, making viewers familiar with his role on Breaking Bad feel like he's channeling Heisenberg.

The plot is well paced, too, and well crafted. The movie begins with an excellent montage that sets the scene for the film, followed by the building of the plan (which is a lot more humorous than it is thrilling, but that helps balance the movie well), then the rescuing of the hostages. The emotion and direction of all of these moments do very well to complement the right tone and the right time. The tense nature of the events and plot of the movie are also excellently crafted. The movie isn't too historically accurate, and shouldn't be taken as such. Still, the setting is expertly crafted to create a tense atmosphere, one that compliments the action of the movie perfectly. Everything about it adds to the thrill: the civilians' struggle to learn their roles, the heated protests and chaotic nature of Iran at the time, the constant close-calls, all of it is technical excellence in making a thrilling movie. It never once matters that they are inevitably saved. Instead, you are worried from moment to moment. The themes of the movie are great as well, with the theme of trust being an especially engaging one throughout the movie.

The soundtrack and cinematography also deserve a good mention. The soundtrack is not one of the greatest, but it does well to create the tone of several scenes, especially with a few of the quieter moments at the end. On the other hand, the cinematography is often great. For example, the scene in the bazaar works well due to the way the camera captures the craziness and chaos of the crowded area, and the way the film often recreates famous scenes and pictures helps give the film a bit more believability (in fact, stay for the credits; it shows a side-by-side comparison).

""Argo"" is a movie well-deserving of its praise. It is not historically perfect, but in this case, the use of history creates an excellent back drop and complements the drama and thriller aspects of the movie superbly. This movie is engaging to watch and can go down as a highlight of 2012 (at least among non-superhero fans).",1377302400,,5077,4.674496644295302

4867276,5,B005S9ELM6,Ben Affleck definitely nailed this movie.  His acting was first rate and the movie was also first rate.  I started watching it and was captivated from the first moment.  I have since watched it several times and would encourage anyone who has not seen it yet to view it.  It is that good.,1377216000,,288,4.377358490566038

4867278,1,B005S9ELM6,"Good god this movie is a mess. If this were a 45-minute short documentary on HBO or History Channel, then it would be interesting. As a movie, it came across as fake, boring and contrived. I was not too well aquatinted with the details of the actual events before seeing this and they seemed fake while watching it. After reading about what really happened, I am even more blown away that people fawn over this turd so much. Outside of Brian Cranston, the acting in this is terrible. Can we stop thinking Ben Crapfleck is good? He's C-Tates if Channing Tatum never grew as an actor. Easily the worst movie to win best picture since crash and there have been some clunkers.",1377129600,4,672,4.516393442622951

Ben Affleck does a fine job, the support cast is very effective ensemble work, but why do I get a feeling that Hollywood was congratulating itself for their contribution to solving a major international crisis?

4867306,5,B005S9ELM6,Great movie.  Argo is one of the best written and fimed in the last 20 years.  Affleck's acting and directing increased my opinion of his abilities. It's one of our favorites.,1376956800,,175,4.612903225806452
4867307,4,B005S9ELM6,"Great job of acting by Affleck.  You forgot it was him at times.  He wasn't playing his usual character.  The most amazing thing was that this was a true story.  It was crazy at the end when they showed pictures from the actual events alongside the pictures from scenes of the movie.  There were scenes I was sure were embellished or made up in the movie that actually happened.

Nothing ground-breaking here, and definitely sensationalized by Hollywood a bit.  But still an entertaining movie.",1376956800,,494,4.809523809523809

4867362,4,B005S9ELM6,"A good retelling of a true story of hostages escaping Iran back in the years of President Carter. Well acted, good sequencing, by people who wanted to pay tribute to the brave people involved.  The hostages had escaped from the embassy to a ""neutral"" location, but were far from safe, needing a rescue.

Like most movies, some characters were combined, some dialog was invented, some complexities were simplified.  For my wife and I the most obvious fictionalization came near the end when dramatic formula demands a tension-release climax.

SEMI-SPOILER ALERT -----

The movie was made for U.S. consumption. An important part of Canada's help IS shown, but I can't help believe there was a stronger role than that.",1376092800,,715,5.02542372881356

4867538,3,B005S9ELM6,"The best part of Argo is the story. It is true and I believe Argo really caught the feel of the times.  I was an undergrad at Indiana University at the time and remember this episode in our nation's history very clearly, even though I am now 53. I witnessed pro-US rallies there, as well as events put on by Iranian students in favor of the revolution.

I do not feel this film deserved an Academy Award for Best Picture, however.  The acting was good, but not great.  Ben Affleck has never impressed me as a very good actor in his previous works, and he did nothing to change my mind with this effort.  Character development was mediocre at best. By the end of the film, I really did not identify with any of the characters.  That is a problem for me.  I want to feel some kind of kinship or emotion for at least one or two characters in a film.  Argo did not achieve that for me.

I was also disappointed in the aspect ratio of this movie: 2.35 : 1.  I did not buy a large screen Samsung HDTV to watch BluRays with a large black strip on the top and bottom of the screen.  I can understand it to a degree in older movies that have been adapted to BluRay, but not movies produced in the last four or five years.  Unacceptable.

My wife and I have now watched Les Miserables (2012) twice--once in the theater last year, and last weekend in our home theater.  It left us speechless both times.  It is an epic film.  Why Argo won Best Picture over Les Miserables is inexplicable.  If you ask me about Argo 15 years from now, I might remember it....maybe.  If you ask me about Les Meserables 15 years from now, it will be emblazoned on my memory, God willing.

Instead of buying this movie, save a few bucks and rent this movie on Netflix, Amazon or Vudu.",1374364800,4,1752,4.22289156626506

4867588,1,B005S9ELM6,"So once upon a time, Ben Affleck, along with Matt Damon, won an Oscar for  Best Original Screenplay for ""Good Will Hunting.""  That was light years ago.  Now Affleck's abysmally terrible movie ""Argo"" has won the Oscar for Best Picture.  ""Good Will Hunting"" was a decent movie, I guess, but ""Argo"" is the most boring, misleading, inaccurate piece of lame, leftist propaganda ever to come down the pike.  How it ever beat out ANY of the other movies in the Best Picture category is beyond me.  Somebody with deep pockets must have purchased that gold statuette -- there's no other way to explain it.  Affleck and his other liberal, left-wing pal, George Clooney, were producers of this clunker, made worse by Affleck's catatonic acting.  I am old enough to remember the actual events depicted in the film, and even as fiction, this movie bites.  Nowhere near what really happened, which would be fine except that Affleck himself tried to use its historical basis as some sort of selling point.  Even worse were Affleck's comments about this film (as quoted in The Hollywood Reporter):  ""And it's the same regime, it was Khomeni, now it's Khamenei -- there's still this Islamist, this Stalinist regime, and that makes me sad. That makes me feel like, yeah, we had this wonderful thing that happened in our movie, where America really did something right, but that we haven't figured out how to navigate our relationship with countries in the Middle East.""  Dear Mr. Affleck:  You are just an actor.  You are not a statesman or an ambassador or a politician or a world leader -- who really gives a rip what you perceive to be our problems in the Middle East?  Bottom line, this movie is rotten film in and of itself.  It's even worse as a political statement, which Affleck clearly intended it to be.  Nauseating.

than any other country in the world. My heart is sad for all those people and what they have

4867733,5,B005S9ELM6,"Argo was a brilliant fast-paced thriller all the way through, even without the historical context. The relatively recent history added to what was already a great movie, and yes, I'm aware that would be Hollywoodized)

It seemed reasonable from the Iranian perspective to point out that the US installed the brutal secular dictator that the Islamic fundamentalists overthrew. Middle Eastern politics often seems to be a choice between those two unpleasant options. I already knew that, but the film reminded me of it.

I noticed that the Farsi was sometimes subtitled and sometimes not, probably to illustrate whether an English-speaking character understood, an effective tactic. I wonder if turning on the BluRay's subtitles would have translated the rest as well. (I'm reminded of Game Of Thrones, which created a fictional foreign language for similar purposes, and that dialogue _was_ translated in the DVD subtitles)

I figured the military personnel were Marines since the USMC typically provides security detachments for US diplomatic facilities. It seems they were simply overwhelmed by the massive numbers of the mob.

I was amused by the sarcasm about Hollywood in the scenes relating to setting up the fake film production. I wonder if it was self-deprecating humor or rants about what the creators had to deal with when interacting with other Hollywood types.

I noticed the media cover story was indeed necessary, to get them past the last layer of airport security.

The changes from real life sometimes imperiled the film as a historical document, but did not hurt and sometimes even helped it as art and entertainment. I've learned from fiction adaptations that sometimes changes have to be made to maintain the story's effectiveness in a different format or account for practical production concerns.

Many changes heightened the drama yet further, which seems reasonable. The six Americans had actually stayed in two Canadian diplomats' houses, and simplifying that seems reasonable. However, Canada's contribution to the planning was downplayed, and Britain and New Zealand were inaccurately disparaged. That's an annoying habit of American media, to downplay the contributions of even other Western countries.",1373155200,,2230,5.409221902017291
4867734,1,B005S9ELM6,"Like many people, I really wanted to enjoy Argo. In fact, on first viewing, I did enjoy it... although only moderately. The problem with Argo is whether or not we should judge it as entertainment or history, fact or fiction.

If you fall into the 'entertainment' camp, then Argo is just another political thriller... and a mediocre one at that. The fictional story is only moderately paced, extremely predictable, and packed to the limit with clichs. You will enjoy yourself for a couple hours then go about your life. You won't feel cheated but you also won't have any real reason to ever see the movie again.

The big problem (for me at least) is for those people who are hoping to get a little history out of their entertainment. And in that aspect, Argo is a total failure, a true crime. The cardinal sin of historical fiction (imo) is when you literally change the hero of a story into a villain. The biggest offender of recent years that I can recall is the movie Big Miracle (about saving the whales in Alaska, starring Drew Barrymore, sp). I have lived in Alaska for almost four decades and was here during the REAL event of the whales being trapped. It made front page news and caught the publics' heart strings. In the REAL world, the whales were saved by the charity of an oil services company named VECO. In the movie, however, the story told the EXACT OPPOSITE; the villain of the film was an oil company - literally a lie. Of course, we all understand why this blatant lie was told. It fits the narrative of certain political factions which essentially control the film industry. Don't get me wrong, the point of telling you this is not to slam the movie business. They have the right to produce any story they wish. They are not historians, they are entertainers. However, anyone who wishes to get history from Argo should ignore the picture completely. Argo is guilty of the cardinal sin; it turns the extremely heroic actions of both British and New Zealand citizens (who bravely supported and hid the Americans) into cowardly appeasement. Would you risk torture and hanging to help people from another country, knowing that if you are caught your family could also be tortured and killed? We should be celebrating people who do something so truly heroic... NOT turning them into villains.

Argo is mediocre as entertainment but worth a rent on movie night when there is nothing else to do. As history, however, it is disgraceful and, I would go so far as to say, perhaps even evil.",1373155200,16,2499,4.649321266968326

Notice at the Academy Awards and Golden Globe Awards how nervous and incoherent Aflick was with Clooney whom he forgot to acknowledge at both events. Clooney said later that the film's award belonged to many other people. I think Aflick knew that the award for best Picture at the Academy Awards was from left field, way left, and he felt the embarassment, the lack of deservedness. He acted like a loser.

Even with the Clooney guidance, the film is very bad and it is a shame that it received any awards at all. The competion was way above this TV Nex Flick.

4867905,5,B005S9ELM6,"I am not a critic, I don't go out to movies anymore, and I'm not even a big fan of Ben Affleck.  But, I found this movie enormously rewarding and entertaining.  I suspect some literary license was taken to heighten the suspense and some facets were obviously glossed over to reduce embarrassment to the politicians involved, but overall the accounting merged well with my memory of events.  It wasn't an Oliver Stone movie, but I don't think it intended to be.  I have recommended the movie to most of my friends, and have even hosted a couple movie nights at my house because I was so excited to share the experience and observe the various reactions.",1372118400,,652,4.594827586206897
4867906,3,B005S9ELM6,"This movie claims to be based on a true story, but everything about it is such cliched hokum it seems more of a typical Hollywood adventure story (but an entertaining one). I don't mind a ""last-second save"" every now and then, but do we need three of them (the reservation on the computer at the last possible second, the crucial phone picked up just as the caller is about to hang up, the cars on the field just as the planer is taking off) in the space of fifteen or so minutes? It's all typical Hollywood stuff, as is the scene where Ben Affleck hatches his scheme while watching ""Planet of the Apes"" (just the way Newton conceived of gravity when an apple fell on his head!) And of course we have to see Aflleck return to his estranged wife to  make the happy ending complete. There are no really interesting characters here and the acting is stiff. (Alan Arkin and John Goodman are added to give a little desperately-needed color to the cast.) Still it was entertaining, though the critical acclaim is hard to comprehend.",1372118400,,1026,4.516129032258065

If you haven't seen it yet, or if you enjoyed it in theaters, but didn't buy it yet, definitely splurge and get the bluray version.",1371945600,,446,4.385542168674699

Yes, there are a few positive attributes, and I suppose it's worth a watch (if you can rent it cheap), but I would NEVER pay movie theater rates for this. It was barely worth the $3.99 rental fee.

I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 simply because I didn't HATE it, it just thought it was kinda sucky (is that a real word???).",1371772800,,448,4.209302325581396

4868002,5,B005S9ELM6,"Having been alive during the Iranian Hostage Crisis, and remembering the sentiment at the time, this was an excellent movie. I was not aware (or don't recall the news stories) of the 6 Americans smuggled out, so there was some historical significance to me. Ironically, I knew of Tony Mendes from hearing about his book and his legendary status at the CIA. The boldness of the mission itself and the behind the scenes political and administrative machinations were intriguing. Adding to the drama was the ridiculousness of Hollywood in the late 70's (or of Hollywood in general) where a few good men did what their government needed them to without blowing it. Thankfully, there was no TMZ or Perez Hilton back then. Once in Iran, the suspense and feeling of claustrophobia for the 6 Americans are palpable. They're stuck in a house for months, unable to go outside, waiting to be saved or to die. When they're days away from escaping, will the maid sell them out? Will the Iranian citizens storm the ambassador's house? Will the citizens sense that they're not who they claim to be? Will they make it through the airport? Affleck did a tremendous job with this project and it deserves all the accolades it has received.",1371686400,,1220,4.786729857819905
4868003,4,B005S9ELM6,I liked the movie. It was very interesting getting a glimpse of recent history. I was a little put off that every male Iranian character in the movie was portrayed as intensely aggressive and on edge. Just wonder if that was true.,1371686400,,230,4.5

 Saw this in the theater ,equaling as appealing to my date as myself.  Noticed no one got up to go to concession stand or restroom! Sometimes ,so quiet with audience so enthralled, it felt like no one was breathing!--- FYI-don't take out or stop this film, before credits at the end --Anyone over the age of 45 will recognize the only( and I mean only flaw) to the movie. where a famous person so involved and perhaps cause of events-TRIES TO REWRITE HISTORY - by  verbal statement after film is over, but before credits run.

4868098,2,B005S9ELM6,"Ben Affleck may be the worst big-name actor I've ever encountered... This movie is Choppy and confusing, not emotion-evoking in the slightest.  I don't see how I made it thru this movie--painstakingly, with the help of an alcoholic drink or 2, I'll say that.  I would not have made it thru if I was truly looking to be entertained. I have sat thru many hollywood movies lately that severely disappoint me--I keep waiting for them to get better.

This movie, I knew, was doomed from the beginning.  One that I just want to turn off immediately, and I wouldn't feel bad about it, whereas I'll usually give a movie a chance to get better.  Really starting to hate these movies that have a decent last 20 minutees or so, maybe more so than those that are horrible all the way thru.

""Edge of your seat"" is exactly the Opposite of what this movie was.  The only tense moments were in the marketplace and in the airport at the end (If you made it that far I'd be surprised).  Such a disappointment at what could have been a great historical rendition, based on such an interesting story.

4868131,3,B005S9ELM6,"This is a taut and gripping thriller. Well made and acted about extricating diplomats from Iran under the guise of a departing science fiction film crew.

The tension builds up nicely with some good humorous moments, mainly from John Goodman. I have to say that the numerous cliff hangers makes for superb viewing!

Like a lot of movies, the facts are often victims of the drama. In the film the CIA states that the hostages were rejected by the Brits and the Kiwis. That is not true. The Brits did take them in and it was only when the British embassy itself faced being stormed that they were moved to the Canadians. Why so many movies select to distort facts unnecessarily is a mystery? it debases the film.

Likewise, we had some Canadian guests who had refused to see the film on the basis that most of the work was done by the Canadians, for which the credit was hi jacked by the CIA in the movie. So, what's new? But it remains a gripping movie.",1371081600,,952,4.3977272727272725

4868136,3,B005S9ELM6,"I watched this AFTER it won numerous awards, so my expectations may have been unrealistically high. To me, it was just an OK movie. Not great and not award-winning. Also, it didn't help that I'd already read the magazine article and book that the movie is based on and so I knew the true story and knew that the movie strays far from the truth. Essentially, the movie is what COULD have happened, but in reality didn't. One of the few factual events in the movie also is one of the most far-fetched. Yes, they did all get drunk the night before they left for the airport. My wife said, ""That's just silly."" But according to all accounts, it did happen. But very little else in this movie really happened the way it is portrayed. Stuff like that irks me. Just promote it as an action thriller loosely based on true events.

4868180,3,B005S9ELM6,"It's an interesting story of how we... umm, the Canadians rescued the American hostages from Iran, but it plays out too much like Zero Dark Thirty did - too close to being a documentary than an action or drama flick.",1370736000,,216,4.425

Excellent movie the one thing that I thought of while watching this movie was that a few very smart people came up with a non violent way to save these 6 (State Department) personal.

4868288,5,B005S9ELM6,We watched this movie on a very stormy night and it made us forget about the tornado sirens going off all around us. Lucky for us the tornado did not touch down in our neighborhood because we were so involved with the movie I'm not sure we would have heard it.  Others were not as lucky I'm sad to say. The movie had humor and excitement plus it was based on real events which brought back many memories of that time. I liked the fact that they used some actual footage at the start of the movie. I wish they had been a little clearer on how the people ended up at the Canadian embassy. Other than that one small gripe I loves the movie.,1370390400,,637,4.096

4868339,5,B005S9ELM6,"A great suspenseful movie,you will be on the edge of your couch. I'm not a big Affleck fan, but I'll give him 2 thumbs up on this one, plus I never realized about the others trapped in Iran other than the hostages the Iranians had.

4868341,2,B005S9ELM6,"This movie fell down completely for me.
Arkin and Goodman were just caricatures, though intended to be satirical of Hollywood.
As far as ""taut, suspenseful movie-making"" goes there are many in this genre that are superior.
It never left Hitchcock behind.
And the unfortunate tendency of script writers in our era to use so many four letter words is a reflection of their inability to write intelligent dialogue.
If everyone tosses out profanity in every situation, men and women alike, from those in the White House to those down on the ground, that is just a way NOT to write a literate, involving script for me.
It's formulaic and hardly makes the characters seem grittier or more sympathetic.
Do all tough guys swear so much?
What if Bourne or Bond tossed off so many lines with the obligatory profanity?
At best this is just generic film-making I am afraid, displaying no originality and utilizes the cliches of other recent and popular films to underwhelming effect.",1370217600,,971,4.890909090909091
4868342,5,B005S9ELM6,I would give it 10 stars if I could.  No wonder it won for best picture! Definitely brought justice to the true story,1370217600,,117,4.086956521739131

4868386,3,B005S9ELM6,"Worth seeing especially after all the hype, but I had thought the six who escaped did use disguises, and I don't believe the events depicted at the airport during their departure were factually accurate.

Thanks to Ben and the production team for making almost a flawless, historic movie about a horrible event.  These people were many of the pawns that big government uses then cast aside.  Thank goodness for the few people like Tony Mendez.  He's a hero and now everyone knows it.",1369958400,,405,4.647887323943662

But the movie was choppy, boring...you never had any character development so you really didn't care whether or not the characters ever got out!  And the interesting part, where they were actually making their escape, took place in just a few minutes.  Not recommended....cannot understand how it won any awards.",1369785600,11,480,4.8765432098765435

4868515,1,B005S9ELM6,"Argo begins well. A brief history, depicted graphic-novel style, reveals how the CIA managed to undermine the will of the people of Iran and install the Shah as a greedy despot. The rest of the film serves to contradict this position as the CIA is made virtuous, and the Iranian people are portrayed as a nation of bumbling evil-doers.

Argo never quite figures out what it wants to do - besides make money, and make Ben Affleck look gorgeous amidst a sea of 70s dorkiness and bad hairdos. If you are looking to waste a Saturday night with a mashup of trite Hollywood fodder, Argo may satisfy you. If, on the other hand, you seek a political thriller, stay far away from this phony movie about a phony movie.",1369699200,4,708,4.488372093023256

4868593,5,B005S9ELM6,I didn't know much about this era and the amazing story of how the 6 Americans who had fled the Embassy prior to the takeover escaped.  Very well done - acting and directing.,1369526400,,174,4.2727272727272725
4868594,5,B005S9ELM6,"I'm sure you have heard all the great things said about this movie so I don't know what I can add.
But I didn't know the history of this story so I was held in suspense. I enjoyed the wardrobe, Ben Affleck was everything he has been said to be.

I will admit I thought it was going to be boring but I was pleasantly surprised. It was very entertaining and it helped me have a better understanding of why there still is not peace in the middle east.

I recommend this for people over 16 yrs of age.",1369440000,,497,4.01010101010101
4868595,2,B005S9ELM6,"To me, the movie has no thrilling moments, no suspense.  I've seen much better acting from Ben Affleck.  And I noticed in the credits that one of the advisors was Huma Abedin, advisor to Hillary Clinton and wife of disgraced NY mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner, who has a long history of involvement in the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood/Sisterhood, as do her parents.  I've had my fill of Muslim infiltration, propaganda and viewpoint.",1369440000,2,433,5.070422535211268
4868596,3,B005S9ELM6,"Argo is the interesting, if not exceptionally engaging, true story of a CIA operation to recover six American hostages in Iran during the 1980s. While the details of the mission are often surprising and interesting, history is against this film, as we all know today that everything worked out fine.

This leads to many scenes filled with obstacles that we know the characters will overcome. They go through an Iranian bazaar, struggle to get past airport security, and eventually onto the plane to take them out of the country. During all of these scenes, the tension feels very forced; rather than focus on the more interesting part of the story (the fake movie they are supposed to be producing and the actions taken by the US government), we are given lots of 5-minute problems.

For example, the hostages are forced to take on new identities in a very short time. What? There's no way it can be done. What? Okay, we'll do it.

Argo is full of scenes like this, which by the end become exhausting. There's not going to be much tension or uncertainty as to the outcome of this mission, so I don't know why director Ben Affeck wastes his time and ours on trying to draw that out in the audience.

The worst offense is when the hostages and CIA operative are on the plane as it is leaving Iran, and Iranian police cars chase after a plane as it is taking off...surprisingly, the police are unable to stop it. I laughed out loud, wondering if the moment was supposed to be funny or if we aren't supposed to know that cars can't outrun airplanes.

One scene I particularly enjoyed was a moment when the hostages' airplane tickets had to be re-sent to the airport; I appreciated seeing the coordination between Affleck's actions (in Iran) with those of Washington DC officials. It's too easy for Hollywood movies to focus on the achievements of one individual, so I welcomed this glimpse of how missions like this requires cooperation from all parties.

This movie was an entertaining one, though unfortunately misguided. It's as though Affleck misread what would make a good movie about this fascinating story.",1369440000,,2109,4.732970027247957
4868597,5,B005S9ELM6,The movie is excellent in all respects. I thinkthat Mr. Affleck should have been entered as a movie dirctor for the Oscar's.,1369440000,,124,4.681818181818182
4868598,4,B005S9ELM6,"Argo was an excellent story, and revealed new information about the Iran hostage crisis and the Carter administration. I didn't give it a five star rating because I'm not sure this is a movie I would watch a second time, but only because I now know the story and it would have the same impact.

There is some irony in the fact that a movie about making a fake movie won the Best Picture Oscar. Perhaps next year's formula will be to make movies about the best pictures never made, but I think this is a one time, fluke occurrence.

I don't know how much dramatic license was taken in the making of the movie; however, I suspect that the dramatic scene at the airport was overplayed in the movie to build to the climax, but I'm not sure the movie could have won best picture without the added excitement as most of the movie develops slowly in order for the audience to understand the role of the various characters.

I know that Ben Affleck has some amazing talents, but I think he would have been better off in casting someone else to play his role while he worked behind the camera. Casting his friend Matt Damon might have been too obvious, and George Clooney might have been over the top; however, I can think of several males that would have been more interesting choices (Matthew Fox, Paul Giamatti, Tom Hanks, and Johnny Depp to mention a few 'A' list actors.)

Still, it won Best Picture, so that makes Ben the winner.",1369440000,,1426,4.431297709923665

4868602,5,B005S9ELM6,This true life conflict felt utterly contemporary to me. The scenes in Iran and Washington rang true. Sometimes it was more like a documentary than an adventure film. The acting was excellent and the characters believable. A chilling commentary on decision making in the government.  It seems like little has changed in the years since the Iran hostage crisis.

4868626,3,B005S9ELM6,"As a ""historical drama"" entertainment, it worked, but with some fatal flaws.
The film started with a brief recap of Iranian's recent history in an effective graphic/comic book fashion.
It then showed the seige of the US Embassy in Iran at the height of US/Iranian conflicts of the 70's
with hostages taken and a small group escaped.
This is the film about the rescue and escape of that small group with the aid of an American CIA agent
and crucial assistance from the Canadian government and diplomats.
It is an entertaining ride with straightforward narrative and engaging acting by the large cast headlined
by the subdued Ben Affleck, a new creation from the real Tony Mendez.
The major flaw that stretched credibility is the missing copies of the required immigration slips for each passenger.
Only one was checked and let go even without the slip.  How about the rest?  The film just let it slide.
The cardboard nasty portrails of the Iranian border guards and the chasing after the plane were so old-schooled
that that diluted the credibility and quality of the film.
It could that this is an easier film to follow than ""Zero Dark Thirty"" to be awarded the Oscar Best Film by the
Academy members.",1369267200,,1201,4.769230769230769
4868627,5,B005S9ELM6,"This film was everything that I hoped it would be and more. I very much enjoyed Ben Affleck's other directing endeavors, and this one did not disappoint. Sure, it was stretching the truth... But when has Hollywood ever made a movie that didn't stretch the truth at some point in a nonfiction film? I thought it was gritty, very real, the suspense was unnerving, and the acting superb. Cinematography, set design -  the feel of the 70s was Fantastic.  I liked it very much and ended up watching it two times back to back... thanks Ben",1369267200,,533,4.541666666666667

It's got a good visual impact, though, and the acting is above par across the board.  Who doesn't love Alan Arkin?  I expected more, and perhaps that's why I didn't enjoy it.

It's a mildly suspenseful story of the extrication from Iran of the hostages who had fled the U.S. Embassy and sought refuge in the Canadian Embassy when Iranians stormed the battlements demanding the return of the cancer-stricken Shah. Affleck uses the pretense that the hostages are a film crew working on a flick called ""Argo"" to smuggle them out of the country to safety in Canada.

It's a well written movie.,1368576000,,370,4.537313432835821

4868822,5,B005S9ELM6,"This movie defenitly did deserve that Oscar and much more, this was defenitly a thriller. I was at the edge of my seat. Ben Affleck, did an amazing job, I was able to feel the fear that the characters felt, I got sucked in and it literally felt like I was there with them. This movie is one of the best movies I have ever watched, the movie should have gotten more praise then the ""amazing  Silver Linings Playbook"". You just really wanted the characters to get out of this situation, the acting was very believable and amazing, you will enjoy this movie, I almost didn't buy it, and boy am I glad I did, I have watched this movie 5 times and it has never failed to make me feel the fear and other emotions these characters had.",1368576000,,728,4.237410071942446
4868863,5,B005S9ELM6,"Outstanding and compelling. The last 20 minutes is the most exciting. All the actors
played there parts very well. This should be required viewing",1368576000,,146,5.125
4868864,4,B005S9ELM6,It was a good movie. I wasn't sure about the quality. I didn't know if it was supposed to be grainy since it was a period piece.,1368576000,,128,3.7777777777777777

4868868,4,B005S9ELM6,"Awesome movie.  However, I did find out that it some of the facts were altered, like usual, to entertain us more.  Why can't we just stick to the facts?  Is a real life hostage situation not intense enough?",1368576000,,206,4.368421052631579

Anyway I was profoundly affected with the story, although the introduction purposely or not leaves out some salient facts about the Shaw that was exiled.  Another cliffhanger about that time and people who had to find a way out based on a couple of Ross Perot's staff who were instrumental in installing Social Security for Iranians, the book is by Ken Follett, the movie I believe was made for TV, both called, ""On Wings Of Eagles"".

4871848,5,B005S9ELM6,"I can only imagine the great and wonderful reviews that are in the Amazon system for this movie, so I won't add too much. I will say that I just recently watched this when I had some family come over and we all loved it. For me, I generally pick up on the filmography and angles of a film. The team did a wonderful job cutting to and from original footage that was taken during this crisis. There are scenes in which there are a screen full of people and it is not easy to have everything work as planned to truly give off the feeling of suspense and being nervous for those in danger.

The movie really paints a beautiful picture of an otherwise sad and gloomy event. Any movie that captures an event and shoots from ways which make you feel like you are a fly on the wall is chilling, to say the least. If you have not seen this yet, I strongly suggest it. After viewing, I had no doubt as to why it won best picture of the year, as it 100% is deserving of such an award.",1368144000,,973,4.041450777202073

4871865,3,B005S9ELM6,"As far as movie making goes I suppose it is good. But the last act is so preposterous and none of it (chase scenes, interrigations, phone calls, scramblingfor tickets, etc etc. ) even happened. Zero Dark Thirty...much, much better.

My need for more conection to the individuals held in the house limited my care and I wish he would have taken more time to explore more of these people lives! Still a good movie experience just not a great film for me! Thanks,1368057600,,334,4.0

The beginning of the story was gripping; didn't like the way the movie was shot, emphasized facial closeups, which I don't particularly like in film, but I'm still a fan of Bens, so maybe I'll like his next better.

Ben Affleck did a great job as a Director as well as portraying this nothing but amazing CIA operative in the movie.  I'd like to meet the real character he played as only someone as low key, determined, and unflappable could ever have pulled this crazy life saving adventure off.  Truly a miracle that these people got out of such a crazy and scary situation in Iran.

4872021,4,B005S9ELM6,"""Argo"" is Ben Affleck's third and most decorated directorial effort, winning an Academy Award for Best Picture and BAFTAs for Best Director and Best Film. It is a thriller based on the rescue of six American diplomats who escaped the occupation of the US embassy in Tehran, Iran in 1979. Following the Islamic Revolution, the US embassy is raided by protesters who demand that the United States return the ousted Shah to Iran to face trial. They held the embassy staff hostage for 444 days, but six of the staff escaped to the home of the Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor (Victor Garber). A CIA agent named Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) plans to exfiltrate the six Americans from Iran under the guise of a film crew. He enlists the help of Hollywood make-up artist John Chambers (John Goodman) who, along with producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), create a film production that will serve as cover.

""Argo"" is essentially a competenet period thriller with a very conventional structure, but it has been praised to the heavens by some critics and criticized by others who see its timing as suspicious. ""Argo"" features some bad Iranians and was released around the time that Western rhetoric against Iran reached a level of belligerence not seen since 1980. Both the film's quality and its politics have been overstated, however. ""Argo"" is not anti-Iranian. It is sympathetic to the Islamic Revolution, though not to its methods, and it places the blame for Iran's troubles on Operation Ajax, the British and American effort that overthrew the elected government of Iran in 1953 and forcibly installed an unpopular Shah to protect Britain's oil interests in that country. ""Argo"" does not focus on Iranians, except to demonstrate the climate of fear, suspicion, and lawlessness that followed the Revolution. Based on what people who were there have said, this seems to be accurate.

The facts of the rescue operation have been altered considerably, however, in order to create suspense. In reality, the six, accompanied by Mendez, sailed through the airport in Tehran without incident. There was no last-minute recall of the mission. The fake film crew never scouted locations. The role of the CIA was also enhanced. Those familiar with the operation, including former President Jimmy Carter, have said that the operation was primarily Canadian. The CIA played a junior role. Perhaps these changes are artistic license, taken in order to make the story more focused and suspenseful. But the film claims that the governments of Great Britain and New Zealand snubbed the six Americans, when actually those governments provided much assistance. Why lie about that when the issue is superfluous anyway? The result was condemnation from the New Zealand House of Representatives and Sir John Graham, Britain's ambassador to Iran at the time.

There will always be different opinions on how accurate films should be if they purport to represent historical events. Affleck and screenwriter Chris Terrio also took the opportunity to take some light-hearted jabs at Hollywood in the scenes in which Mendez works with Chambers and Siegel to create the illusion of a genuine sci-fi action film entitled ""Argo"". This is the film's comic relief. The producer, Lester Siegel, is a fictional character, a stereotype of the world-weary Hollywood player, presumably included to give John Goodman someone to play off of. I like the period qualities of the film. It has good pacing and kept my interest. But I couldn't help but cringe a little every time I noticed this story being straight-jacketed into a very conventional formula with a lot of stock characters and looseness with facts that aren't always a good fit.",1367452800,,3689,5.084158415841584

  The story was based (very loosely, I would guess) on an historical event, although they must have used half a tankerload of white wash in giving Washington's side of the action.  Seems that covering incompetency with bull wasn't confined to Benghazi or limited to the current administration, I did see some parallels.

  I would suggest renting it, keeping the kiddies away from the screen when you watch it, unless you want the little cherubs to go around saying ""ARGO **bleep** yourself"" for the next couple of weeks.",1367280000,,790,4.772058823529412

4872123,5,B005S9ELM6,"This movie received the Academy Award in 2012 for the best picture, but I was really impressed by Ben Affleck.  He is director and main character in this film and delivers on both fronts.  Affleck plays CIA agent in active duty in Washington, DC during Jimmy Carter's administration.  From the start of the movie, his character, Tony Mendez, is weary man, living alone in a small apartment apparently in a lot of personal, emotional pain.

This is also time when great political changes are happening in Iran.  Former Shah Reza Pahlawi is exiled from Iran in the US and the new conservative religious leader Khomeini takes the power.  Iran is in dis-array and one day civilian riot breaks in.  Crowd decides to break into American Embassy and take its employees hostages.  Only six Americans manage to escape and find temporary shelter with Canadian Ambasador's home.  Their time in hiding is running out and American government creates a secret mission (Argo) to rescue them all from Iran.

I was touched by Tony's role in a mission.  He volunteers to save civilians who served US Foreign Service in Ran.  He puts his life on the line.  It all makes sense.  After all, he has nothing to loose.  His separation from his wife and son is obviously devastating for him.  Reasons for their estrangement are unimportant.  It is emptiness and loneliness that is the pivot point of his life.  A man like that is a perfect candidate for the suicide mission.  Regardless if he makes it alive or not, he wins.  If he dies, his pain will finally go away, and so will his isolation and loneliness.  If he lives, he is a hero who has a chance ot reclaim his old life and finally redeem himself.

And so the story goes about one man's mission to save lives of six people serving the American government who are stranded in a hostile foreign contry.  I really enjoyed Alan Arkin's role in a movie.  He plays a Hollywood producer who pulls the strings to make a difference simply out of his patriotic feelings for the country and no monetary payoff.  At the end of the film we even hear the voice of the former President Jimmy Carter who explains the secrecy around this mission that kept mission classified for nearly 10 years before public became aware of it.

In any case, it is a wonderful film showing the humanity at its best and its worst.  It showcases important part of American history when the Iranian hostage crises took place and how it influenced the following events inthe American political history.  I have enjoyed every moment of this film - from start to finish.",1367280000,,2565,4.652561247216036
4872124,3,B005S9ELM6,"A good film although perhaps not quite worthy of the title Picture of the Year.
The performances are fine  but the story-telling technique and direction of this historical event feel uninspired.
And since the audience is already aware that the people are actually rescued, a more imaginative approach to the storytelling itself
might have made it more engaging .
A good example would be Alan J. Pakula's Oscar winning film ""All the Presidents Men,"" wherein an historical event became a fascinating, engaging piece of cinema.
As it stands, ""Argo"" is an entertaining first attempt from an unexperienced director that's just a notch above most thriller/action/ style films.",1367280000,,670,5.261682242990654

4872355,3,B005S9ELM6,"I think I know why ""Argo"" won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Hollywood loves itself. It loves movies about itself. And it really loves movies where Hollywood helps the CIA save the day.

In fact, you can practically hear the producers squealing whenever cynical Hollywoodites appear in ""Argo,"" helping set up a sensitive operation to rescue innocent Americans from peril. The movie itself is a fairly decent dramatization of a real-life rescue from Iran, but ironically the halfhearted Hollywood qualities are also what bogs down the story.

When the United States gives asylum to the dying Shah of Iran, a militant mob retaliates by attacking the American Embassy in Tehran. Six people escape to the Canadian ambassador's house, but they have no way of getting home -- if they even try to step outside, they will be recognized and killed.

So the State Department calls on Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), a CIA specialist who immediately shoots down all their idiotic ideas. He has the kind of idiotic idea that you seriously think Hollywood made up: pretend to be a team of Canadian filmmakers scouting for locations for a sci-fi/fantasy movie. Yes, seriously. With no better ideas on the table, the government reluctantly gives approval.

With the help of film producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) and make-up artist John Chambers (John Goodman), Mendez sets up a fake studio, fake casting, and a terrible script called ""Argo."" Posing as a producer, Mendez infiltrates Iran with a bunch of fake Canadian passports -- but one slip could mean death for him and the hostages.

I admit to knowing very little about the real-life hostage situation, because it happened long before I was born. But even before being dramatized by Hollywood, it's a pretty bizarre story -- and I doubt Hollywood could have found a more ideal movie to lavish praise on. After all, it's about Hollywood helping save the day from Evil Middle-Easterners!

And the movie is genuinely well-done, especially once we get to Tehran -- there is a palpable sense of tension, as if Mendez and the hostages are dancing over tripwires. You really feel the delicate situations that are arising, and how the slightest mistake could get everyone killed. And despite the truly ridiculous ""making a movie"" idea (complete with costumes!), director/actor Ben Affleck does manage to handle it with a straight face.

However, it also suffers from some excessively cheesy dialogue (""No, I was screaming his name 'cause I was f***ing him""), and some hideously awkward attempts at character development. The whole ""absentee daddy"" subplot is just so painfully Hollywood, as is the scene where the plane tickets are approved JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME, or when the Iranian guards chase them all the way to the plane.

And while it attempts to show that the greatest victims of tyranny in Iran are its people, almost all the Iranians we see are either beady-eyed, bearded thugs or ravening rage-zombie mobs. It's just one of many hoary old cliches that are trotted out here.

Ben Affleck was starring as well as directing here, and he does an excellent job job -- he's subtle and low-key, especially during the scenes where they try to sneak through an airport. Most of the other notable performances are from the Hollywood ""characters,"" namely Arkin and Goodman; the government suits are honestly hard to tell apart, and rarely do much except bluster.

""Argo"" is a solid thriller with a quietly compelling, intense style, and Affleck does a good job juggling direction and acting. But the onslaught of cliches leaves you acutely aware that this is a Hollywood movie, and the kind they love best.",1366761600,,3644,4.959016393442623

4872422,4,B005S9ELM6,"Right up front, lets be clear... this one isn't for the kids.  The script is laced with profanity.  No rants, just plenty of salt.  Even if parents can get past that, the MPAA warnings about violence and disturbing images are very well-deserved here.  Beyond that, this is compelling, intriguing and at times confusing viewing for someone in their late 20's, who narrowly missed living through such a turbulent period in US-Iran relations.  These events are pulled from a long and tense history between the two countries, and undoubtedly form part of the knotty international relations challenge that my generation will inherit.  Particularly in the wake of Arab Spring, I found this movie insightful and eerily relevant.  It made me realize just how ignorant of that tangled history I--like many Americans, perhaps-- am.

Affleck manages to deliver the central story with immediacy but without politicking, and always lets the drama of the events drive the story rather than trying to stage drama around the characters and risk clouding the bigger picture.  The hostage rescue attempt plays out in context, instead of subverting the gut-wrenching results of a clash of political wills to fit Hollywood cliches.  There are, nonetheless, moments of levity.  I can't comment on just how historically accurate the screenplay is, but it has certainly incited my curiosity to research these events for myself.  Despite the understated performance of the lead character (portrayed by a self-effacing Affleck), who is often ""outplayed"" by the actors/actresses he shares the screen with (purposefully, I believe), you are slowly drawn into sympathizing with him and rooting for his success...not only in an epic international rescue effort, but in the face of great personal struggles.  The filming, like the actor, is artful but subtle, never getting in the way of the momentum of the story.  Overall, the scenes feel gritty and real, not stylized.

I didn't realize how invested in the film I was until the last ten minutes, when I spontaneously (and audibly) joined in the central characters' expression of emotion.  Not wanting to spoil the outcome for anyone, I'll leave it there.  But be forewarned, this is neither an easy nor a relaxing watch.  Reluctantly, I gave it 4 stars for that reason.  There is not quite enough character content and a little too much language to make this worthy of adding to my library.  That said, I think that it should be recommended viewing for youngish adults who, like me, missed the crisis but live with the fall-out.",1366761600,,2551,5.086538461538462
4872423,5,B005S9ELM6,"Viewed online via Comcast. I enjoyed this more than I expected. What an ordeal for the CIA operative played by Ben Affleck. The thread of history --- awesome! The CIA coined the word 'blowback' to describe situations resulting from previous covert operations. Here, I reference the overthrow of the democratically elected Iranian Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh in 1953 by US and British operatives.

Mossadegh's removal allowed the US and the UK to seat the Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in the position of authority. Twenty-six years later the Ayatollah appeared and American embassy personnel were held captive over 400 days. ARGO tells the story of the efforts of unknown Americans and Canadians determined to assist Americans not yet hostages to flee Iran. I keep the comments very general in hopes of preventing 'spoiler' slips of tongue.

Kudos, once again, to Ben Affleck.",1366675200,,879,5.226950354609929

Argo is flat lifts of media clips of the operation, only simplified Disney-fashion cardboard to become dull renditions of the story.(THE KINGDOM showed
a very different aspect of how the Mid East works). Showed it elegantly and entertainingly too.

Argo is stolid description, not drama. R-rated? It's
far more G-rated for its flat antiseptic presentation.

THE KINGDOM is Real, scary, involving, believable, impact-ful, being beautifully produced (with authentic plot/people/motivations, acting, situations, frustrations, action and true to life Saudi attitudes and locations. It's so much better than ARGO.

I do agree that they did not make full use of the supporting actors, i.e. John Goodman and Victor Garber. The only other details they left out was that the escapees didn't just leave the day after showing up in a bazaar in the middle of town. They should have taken another half hour to go in a little more detail of when Mendez landed in Iran to how he actually got them out.

Otherwise, I think with the time of the movie, they developed the details with a good intro into the events leading to the hostage situation, playing out the hostage situation and how to get the 6 out. The day of escape left me at the edge of my seat. The only implausible event was how the Iranians didn't figure out what was going on underneath their noses.",1366588800,,858,4.263803680981595

4872489,4,B005S9ELM6,"""Argo"" is a movie trying to decide what kind of movie it wants to be. Political thriller? A satire that compares Hollywood with Washington D.C. (like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Shot/dp/B003Y19E4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Shot</a>"")? Or straight based on a true story historical film? It has elements of all but fails to commit to any of them and comes up with a patchwork movie not sure of where it wants to go.

After the Iranian revolutionary guard took over the American Embassy in Tehran in 1979, six embassy employees were able to make it to the Canadian Embassy where they were given asylum. Sooner or later the Iranians would discover some Americans made it out of the embassy, so they have to be smuggled out of Iran before they're discovered.

Ben Affleck plays (and directs `Argo') Tony Mendez, a CIA operative whose job it is to extricate Americans from foreign countries. His idea is to go into Iran and walk the Americans out in plain sight. He comes up with a cover story that he's a producer of an American movie titled Argo (because the whole world loves American movies), which is a Star Wars science fiction type movie. He enlists make-up man John Chambers (John Goodman, playing another good over the top role since ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flight/dp/B00BB8RKH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flight</a>""), and Alan Arkin playing a movie producer. They set up a phony production company in L.A., run phony notices of the impending production, and Mendez heads off to Iran. Once in Iran, Mendez faces the Americans, some of whom are skeptical of the plan and are restitant to it. Mendez convinces them it's the only chance they have and takes them to `scout' Iranian locations for the movie, and then walk them out through the airport under the noses of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.

Affleck does a good job handling the dual role of actor/director. There's no splashy performances, the acting is uniformly good. There's some tension at the expected moments in the film such as will the Americans be recognized and/or identified as the missing American Embassy employees? Will their identities be compromised by Iraninan employees of the Canadian embassy? And will they make it safely past the Iranian Revolutionary Guard? Even though `Argo' is based on historical events that (in theory) we already know the outcome of, Affleck ably manifests the tension.

`Argo' is a good movie, that is enjoyable and has good acting, but could have been a whole lot better if it had decided early on what kind of picture it wanted to be.",1366502400,,2652,5.247641509433962

Tony Mendez is a CIA agent chosen to get them out any way he can, but to do that, he needs a plan, a good one, since the job seems almost impossible. While watching television,the plan comes to him, one that is both audacious and bold, one worthy of Hollywood, and so ""Argo"" is born. Disguised as a film crew, he finally leads the six through the streets of Teheran and finally to the airport, but it is a race both against time and the Iranians, who have pieced together who was missing from the Embassy and are hot on their trail, so hot, in fact, that they are literally trying to chase down the plane as it is taxiing down the runway.

4872681,4,B005S9ELM6,"Finally On Demanded Argo this past weekend. The movie certainly deserved all of the high acclaim it received from the critics and the film award associations. It was well written, entertaining and quite thrilling.

The movie is the depiction of how CIA operative Tony Mendez led the rescue of a group of U.S. Embassy employees out of a hostile Tehran during the 1979 Iran Hostage Crisis. I understand that there is some controversy over how some of these actual events were portrayed for the sake of dramatic effect in the film versus how the events played out in reality. But look...it wasn't supposed to be a documentary; it's a Hollywood movie. So of course true to form there were some times where Director Ben Affleck self indulgently seemed to make his character the only logical voice in the room while portraying the CIA brass as obtuse and indifferent emotionally to what was being suffered by the hostages. That's Hollywood.

Argo is a fine telling of the story of how 6 US diplomats were rescued and brought home from what must have been absolute Hell at the time. Don't skip Argo. Great movie.",1365984000,,1105,4.75

4872684,2,B005S9ELM6,"A big disappointment.  I expected a good movie about the hostage rescue attempt.  Even though Affleck seems to have made sure a late-1970s setting was used he failed to make a nonfiction movie with any action.  Actors were obviously told to use the F word over and over.  It became ridiculous and boring.  If you want to increase the commonality of such nonsensical movies and listen to lines full of foul language, watch it.

The characters were generally well developed, and the 1979 pictures versus the actors and cinematography gave an amazing insight into the lengths the producers went to ensure that the film was reasonably true to the events.  While there was certain cinematic license and elements around both chase scenes and dialogue that could be criticized from a historical perspective, as a thriller based on historical events, this movie was a non-stop, edge of the seat, entertaining way to spend a few hours on a flight to London (thank you Delta).

4872700,4,B005S9ELM6,"For those of us alive when the hostage crisis took place in the seventies we've not forgotten what tensions in the Middle East were like at that time. We had a president who showed a weak America and that was played upon by terrorists who had captured and held captive American hostages for 444 days in 1979 through 1981. Most born since those dates have little or no idea that it happened. It's become a forgotten page in history. Not so any longer.

ARGO tells the story not of those particular hostages but of 6 Americans who escaped from the Embassy before it was taken. Hidden in the home of the Canadian ambassador, a team of CIA operatives worked on plans to help them escape. With streets to overflowing with hostile protestors and terrorists the straight and easy methods were out. There was little that could be done and no plan seemed fool proof. But one might do the trick.

Ben Affleck (who also directed) stars as Tony Mendez, a CIA agent who has planned escapes before. A chance look at a trade magazine and a plot forms in his head: pretend that a Hollywood production company is making a science fiction movie and take the 6 people out as members of the crew scouting locations. All it takes is finding a way to make it appear they came into the country so they can be taken out. With nothing but bad ideas on how to rescue these 6 people, this becomes the best worst idea.

Mendez sets about by recruiting a friend in John Chambers (John Goodman), the special effects man responsible for the make up in PLANET OF THE APES. He in turn helps Mendez connect with Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), a producer of note in the past who agrees to help them set up a fake production company and to find the right script. Everything has to appear on the up and up to convince the Iranian government. A script is found, an office opened, ads posted in the trade magazines and a party with a reading of the movie is even held all to make it seem legit.

Backgrounds for each of the ""crew"" members are formed and set up for Mendez to provide each of the 6 still in Iran. They will have to know their cover stories to the letter if the plan is to work. Once Mendez gets the okay and lands in country, this becomes a point of contention among the 6. While their options are non-existent, a few have a problem coming to terms with this plan. Mendez assures them he will get them out.

The majority of the film involves the set up of the escape of the 6. The planning, the bureaucracy and the involvement of so many people with so many possibilities of the plan failing are covered. What is amazing is that these details are spun here in such a way as to never be boring or seem like the film lasts too long, unlike ZERO DARK THIRTY. Instead, Affleck has the pacing of the film done to perfection.

The last portion of the film involves the group as they finally leave the ambassador's home and head for the airport. Affleck again does a magnificent job as the tension mounts from minute to minute. Whether you know the results of this mission or not you soon find your palms sweating and heart racing as you wait to see if they escape or not.

ARGO was nominated for and won the Best Picture Oscar this past year. For once I have to agree with a win in that category. This is truly a movie worth watching more than once. The only sad note is that Affleck was overlooked when it came to direction. That award went to Ang Lee for LIFE OF PI. While I enjoyed that movie as well, I think perhaps Affleck should have edged out Lee. Perhaps one day Hollywood will recognize his talents behind the camera as well as in front.",1365897600,,3614,4.329394387001477

I love the Amazon Prime 2 day shipping, I don't even have to shop for the best price at the Target, Wal-Mart, Sam's, Costco, and burn up gas (which in California, is HUGE) running around.  Everyone competes on the first week of release, the first day prices are really nice, when the movies come out on DVD.  Amazon puts those prices to shame.

4872830,1,B005S9ELM6,"Definitely not the movie I was expecting to see.  I actually thought this movie was going to offer exposure to people who were ignorant to Iran, but instead it only confirmed and reinforced any prejudices one might have about the country and it's people.  There were many scenes of Iran in the movie (actually shot in Turkey) and in almost every scene the Iranians are depicted as one giant mob of frowning, belligerent, lifeless-zombies.  Their mouths are literally drooping over as they crowd the streets in search of flags to burn and people to hang.  It's like night of the living dead.

Along with that there are more subtle, totally unnecessary depictions of Iranians.  For example, the rule is, if you are an Iranian and you are in a rush and running somewhere, you must find a random woman to shove to the ground on the way to get where you are going.

But all is good in the end, when the heroic Americans escape and are informed on the plane that they can now begin drinking their booz again.",1365638400,4,1002,4.533333333333333
4872831,5,B005S9ELM6,"Doing a movie on a real life situation is always difficult but they really pulled it off here. You could feel the fear, tension and the unknowingness the people were going through. Just a very well made movie something you would believe could happen and it was amazing how all angles were looked at to make sure their plan worked as best it could. The fear of failure was always there but Ben Affleck kept it together for the sake of the group even though he feared it may not work. It gives you a gimps into the life of the people who do these missions that don't exist and how much they are giving up to protect others even though they may die in the process. I was on the edge of my seat even though I knew the final result the not knowing what was going to happen next kept the movie flowing.",1365638400,,796,4.141935483870967
4872832,5,B005S9ELM6,"I loved Argo.  As someone who lived during the time of the events depicted in the film, I can testify that the feeling of the film -- the costumes, the film quality, the dialogue of the characters -- completely immersed me in the late '70's.  It was an incredibly tense time for Americans in the Middle East, and the thought that anyone would actually go into that setting to save others is mind-blowing.  To see how he did it is amazing.  I went into this movie knowing the outcome, but that didn't diminish the intensity at all.  In fact, in order to be able to stand the tension, there were times I had to chant to myself, ""They're going to make it out alright.  They're going to make it out alright.""  That being the case, however, I still couldn't imagine HOW they were going to make it out alright.  Absolutely awesome!",1365638400,,825,4.417218543046357
4872833,4,B005S9ELM6,"truth be told, because i don't like to read too much about such a highly acclaimed film, i honestly thought this film was about the americans being held hostage in the american embassy/consulate. the ones that had the unsuccessful rescue attempt that ultimately sank president carter's prospects for re-election in 1980. instead, this film is about a successful and unconventional rescue attempt for a separate group of americans whom were hiding in the canadian consulate. whether the suspense-related elements of the plot were historical accurate or poetic license added for story-telling purposes, i'm not sure. but by contrast to the failed military rescue attempt, this story highlights a successful, non-violent rescue attempt made possible by the creativity of american ingenuity. the film has a great cast and a few unexpected moments of humour to boot.",1365638400,,861,5.385185185185185

4872878,4,B005S9ELM6,"One cannot know how accurate the representations of the real characters and actions were -- representations of what really happened in Iran at that time.  Ben Affleck's character and the Hollywood characters were actually more believable than the six escapees.  The six embassy workers were not especially convincing.  I suspect that more of those six actual embassy workers would have been cooperative and ready to be helped in escaping.  There is always a lot of an ""I know better"" or ""prove it to me - before I can go along with this"" attitude from people in the real world, but I am nave enough to doubt that there could be so much of this in all six of those embassy workers.  Whether that was the writing or the directing, it seemed distorted.",1365552000,,749,4.643939393939394

Not to mention, Ben Affleck looked like he was trying too hard to be a serious actor and that beard he had makes him look like a pervert.  The way it was filmed was not original.  It was filmed in the same style as Babel and A Mighty Heart, the only difference was those 2 movies I mentioned were excellent films.  believe the hype, The Oscars are going down hill and they have been for the last 5 years.",1365552000,2,514,4.11

However, the story's real high points were more than predictable and in the end, I do not subscribe to this film having been placed so high for the year, especially when it was on the same short list as ""Lincoln""! Whereas this film had its spare moments one kept looking for the Run Pee spaces. Lincoln, on the other hand placed you squarely in the center of the piece and DDL provided a human look at what the man Lincoln endured at the end of the Civil War. Argo was certainly an entertaining piece but surely not worthy of the award.

I literally had no idea what was going to happen from one moment to the next and it just keeps building the pressure on these characters.

The performances were good, although I don't know that they were great. The movie is shot kind of like a gritty 70s cop show with crazy zooms and shaky camera work. Will Arnett and John Goodman are briefly in it but highly under utilized.

I really recommend this movie, it's just a really great study of a messed up event from our history and how luck and a bit of ol' fashioned American ingenuity might just save the day....but will that be enough?",1365465600,,757,4.142857142857143

4873005,4,B005S9ELM6,"The shock heard around the world happened when Ben Affleck wound up UN-nominated for the Director Oscar this past year.  I had yet to see `Argo' but I was wholly convinced that Affleck and the film were going all the way with Oscar.  It just seemed like his time.  The film wound up winning the big award, but Affleck obviously couldn't win for Best Director.  Having seen the film now, I can understand why the directors branch didn't nominate Affleck (of his three films this is the more conventional and awards friendly but it is also the least inspired from a directorial perspective).  Can't say that I understand why this film swept through the awards season though.

That isn't to say that `Argo' isn't a good film.  It's a fine film, but it's just that...a fine film.  It's rather generic and formulaic and it doesn't really do anything new or special.  The intensity that is carried through in certain scenes carries an air of staginess that doesn't truly lift the film.  In fact, Affleck held better form in both his previous efforts, and while he utilized his editor to better effect than in his previous films (whose primary faults were that they were too long) he failed to build something that felt fresh.

Based on actual events, `Argo' is a thriller that chronicles a covert operation to rescue six American's who are hiding out in Iran after the American Embassy was taken hostage by Iranian fanatics.  Tony Mendez, CIA operative, is asked to find a way to get the six out of Iran.  Coming up with the `best bad idea' possible, Tony enlists the help of Hollywood to help him fake a movie as a disguise to sneak the American's out of the country.

The look and feel of the film is pretty great.  I loved the way they completely recaptured old Hollywood, from the costumes to the sets.  The dialog is sharp and moves the film along really well (even if it feels forced in parts) and the performances, while none extraordinary, are uniformly fine.  Arkin is funny, Cranston is hard edged (until he gets all paranoid and starts to growl at everyone) and Victor Garber makes everything better.  Affleck is in fine form, and the rousing finale almost had me in tears.  I can see why AMPAS loved this, for it is a very good film, but I don't think I'll be thinking about this much in a few months.  It's just kind of there; a good film and serves a purpose and then leaves you.  Some of the facts were shifted, and some of the tension is completely manufactured (the ending plane chase doesn't work as well as they want it to) but at the end of the day one can't deny that `Argo' is very entertaining.",1365379200,,2611,4.512765957446809

4873073,5,B005S9ELM6,"Hollywood did itself proud to award this perfectly-crafted thriller the Academy Award for 2012.  It's guaranteed to have you at seat's edge, so knotted up that you'll be constantly looking at your watch not out of boredom but to be assured that the unbearable tension can't go on forever.

Graham Greene was a writer who distinguished between his deep, soul-searching works and his who-dunnit-style mysteries, calling the former ""literature"" and the latter ""entertainments.""  ""Argo"" definitely shines as a stellar example of the latter.  Unlike the socio-theological examination of life that we get from ""There Will Be Blood"" or ""No Country for Old Men"" (or, for that matter, Shakespeare's tragedies), ""Argo"" pieces together an historical moment with such resourceful precision that we can only marvel at the craft of the director, which manifests a restraint, patience and attention to detail comparable to that of the Iranian children whom we witness piecing together the evidence of what we're seeing from the thousands of strips that have been confiscated from the overrun American  Embassy.

In the script John Goodman, while helping Affleck construct the ruse that will permit him to free six Americans, calls directors stupid know-nothings, assuring Affleck that the American posing as a director has the easiest role of all.  At the end of the film, when the plane is finally off the ground, that individual playing a film director approaches the real director, Affleck, and extends his hand as a gesture of thanks and admiration.  As viewers we might do the same.  However it was done, ""Argo"" is at once a delicate balance and an infinitely complex mosaic of small pieces.  Yet, in the grand Hitchcock manner, nothing is wasted, nothing is gratuitous.  Every piece fits so well that for two hours we return to a moment in Iran in 1979.  If we leave the theater none the wiser, we also leave it marveling at where we have just been and what we have just seen.  Acting, spectacle, film scoring--all of these components of a movie are strangely irrelevant in ""Argo."" All we're left with is the film.  There is absolutely no room for clutter.

We knew going in that Jason's journey was sheer fantasy and that the movie within the movie (""Argo"") was a sheer ruse.  Yet we need no convincing that the ""Argo"" we've just experienced was as real and believable as a film can be.  If Affleck's Argo played somewhat loose with the facts, it proves no less compelling than the mythological Argo--or the deception that proved successful to the mission.  In fact, the film succeeds because of the believability of 3 Argo's: the mythological story that has captivated readers for many centuries; the film fantasy concocted to contrive a release of the prisoners; the film we have just viewed and experienced for two breathless hours.

There are three definitions of film that in my experience account for the compelling power of this art form to strike the sparks of truth from the stuff of imagination.  Orson Welles' ""Ribbon of Dreams"" is not nearly as flimsy and fantastical as it may initially appear.  From the scenario proposed by Affleck's character to the blocking out of characters and action, the entire project hung explicitly on cinema's hold on the imagination, its power to engage the viewer in a willing suspension of disbelief no less ""real"" than the most vivid dream or nightmare.  Second is Jean Luc Godard's definition, ""film is truth 24 times a second,"" reminding us that film in our post-Einstein quantum-mechanical world of the ""dynamic"" comes closer to representing a reality that is always changing, capturing our present experience more accurately than any form that restricts meaning to a ""Bergsonian, knife-edge instant.""

But it finally is Siegfried Krackauer's definition of film that brings to film its moral compass while emphasizing the awesome responsibility of the filmmaker. At its best, film has the potential, beyond any other visual form, of being a ""redemption of physical reality.""  The very last words of the film, some of the first from a recognizable public figure, are those of Jimmy Carter, who validates all that we have just seen, providing that final piece of evidence (while satisfying Krackhauer's requirement) that we need to make Argo more than a myth, a story, even a movie.  It's an historical experience, one that has been saved from all the competing ""noise"" in politics, war and history to resonate in our imaginations long beyond the lives of any of its participants, creators, and possibly even later participants.

Post-script: seeing ""Argo"" during the Easter season and in view of Krackauer's contention, I couldn't help but muse over film's redemptive quality in relation to the Incarnation and Resurrection.  Conclusion: film can preserve the miracle of the Incarnation, representing figures who appear to represent a supernatural, or spiritual, ancestry.  It cannot however work in the reverse direction, however, suspending the physical and temporal world of experience for the sake of representing the supernatural.  The same lens that verifies the fleshliness of the spiritual is powerless to demonstrate the spiritual component of the physical world.  In fact, there is no film director, no medium, no church, no creed, no book, no tradition capable of making the case for the divine in the material world.  As Tennyson puts in, ""There lives more faith in honest doubt than in half the creeds.""  Proof of the resurrection, in fact, demands doubt in the evidence of the eye, the ear, the mind--with respect to the existence of the divine the material world is a dark veil of ignorance penetrable only by the individual's spiritual eye of belief.",1365206400,,5706,5.076017130620985

4873167,4,B005S9ELM6,"This is a solid, suspenseful film, with lots of interesting historical background. Most people are probably familiar with the premise by now - 6 Americans manage to escape the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in the 70s when it is taken over (which led to the Iranian hostage crises). Hiding out in the Canadian embassy, they have few options for escape. Ben Affleck's character plays the CIA agent who hatches a plan to extract them - they are scouting locations for a film to be shot there. To make it plausible they have to hire a real director and special effects coordinator in Hollywood, use a real script, and get some press. The premise is loosely based on an actual escape that took place, but the facts are much different than portrayed in this film - the Canadians did most of the work in the real case, with the CIA in a supporting role, and there wasn't as much drama involved in the actual escape.
But if you watch this as fiction, and don't get caught up in that, it's a good film. I thought the opening sequence, where the embassy is taken over, was masterful, really capturing the chaos and fear of the scene, as well as the time period. That is really the strength of the film throughout, as well as the building of suspense. Less successful for me were the attempts at character development, both Affleck's and the hostages. But overall, I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1365033600,,1371,4.554655870445344

4873226,3,B005S9ELM6,"A great story and we could have learned more about the 6 Americans but instead we get Ben Affleck brooding about something or other with a few scenes that go nowhere. Affleck could have been a good actor but you couldn't tell from this film. He can neither show fear, sadness, anxiety, joy, excitement or any of the other human emotions people have from time to time. He remains this aloof menopausal James Bond character whose only acting dimension is to look sullen and forelorn. When he speaks he mumbles. If you really are out to save six people one should get fired up about it and thereby instill some hope and life in the people he is rescuing. Naturally John Goodman and Alan Arkin breath some life into this film with some good scripting and acting but they couldn't carry the whole show. Mr. Affleck continues to be a one dimensional actor taking his cue from the old Charles Bronson movies. I wanted to know more about the six Americans and how they got separated from the Embassy and what was going on with their lives, their hopes, their dreams and their struggles. There could have been some real drama portrayed there but they never got the chance. They had to be very important else why would so many do so much for so few?",1364947200,,1239,4.486725663716814

Argo is a good, entertaining movie, but nothing out of the ordinary. Nothing that puts you on the edge of your seat, or dredges up any emotions really.
Zero dark thirty on the other hand, was intense and dramatic from start to finish, with an Oscar worthy performance from the lead.
Just goes to show you that the oscars are a joke, hollywood basically voted for itself in this one, because the movie was about how hollywood people helped the CIA get their people out of Iran. Self appreciation at its worst.",1364947200,,686,4.4523809523809526
4873255,4,B005S9ELM6,"I had no idea this actually occurred. All the talk back then was about the hostages. Of course I was stationed in Germany at the time, so there was not that much stateside news. Good movie, well directed supspense thriller.",1364947200,,223,4.6
4873256,4,B005S9ELM6,"I got the feeling that this movie accurately reflected the clash and chaos that prevailed in much of Iran just before and after the Shah was deposed. An acquaintance of mine who had travelled to the Middle East during this period, showed me the dictionary she had had been given to help her translate from English to Farsi. The book had the usual section of ""Commonly Used Phrases."" Next to the standard inquiries helping tourists find a bathroom and get something to eat, there appeared the presumably equally likely question of, ""What time are the executions?""

While the apparent need to know how to ask such a question in Iran seemed comical when viewed on the page - there was nothing comical about the reality. The atmosphere that made such a question standard is vividly captured in ""Argo."" We see the tension, the cruelty, and the horror of those days.

However, other aspects of ""Argo"" left me somewhat unsatisfied. We don't really get to know the people involved in this fictionalized account of the hostage rescue that took place at the end of the Carter administration and the beginning of the Reagan administration. There are too many individuals represented too briefly on the screen.

John Goodman's character is one of the few whose personality does come through in this hectic barrage. Goodman performs the same role here that he performed in ""Flight,"" the almost simultaneously released movie. Goodman is again the lovably cocky go-to guy with a specialized talent. His skill at transforming people with make-up doesn't actually seem to be needed though. So ultimately, his character also gets overtaken by the quick-cut, fast-shuffle pace of the movie.

The choppy briefness of each scene recalled the slapping blades of a helicopter - and so actually put me more in mind of the Viet Nam evacuations than of Iran rescues, although no helicopters were actually shown as being involved in this operation. Director Ben Affleck might have done well to learn from the appeal of movies such as ""Fargo."" The Coen brothers aren't as relentlessly driven to ""get on with it."" They understand the value of pausing for seemingly irrelevant anecdote about each of their characters. With ""Argo"" since we don't get to know the people involved, we don't care as much as we might have.

Nevertheless, ""Argo"" deserves a high rating for putting the viewer in the kind of heart-pounding, breath-catching situation that all the hostages, their rescuers, and many average citizens were in during this turbulence.",1364947200,,2509,5.0071942446043165

It's an incredible story, certainly very dramatic, but the telling of it lacked the emotional tug I thought it would have. I'm not sure that Ben Affleck should have been the one to play the key role...he's a talented director and did a fine job with a complicated story, but I found his understated performance left a bit to be desired.

4873281,4,B005S9ELM6,"Not a movie buff, myself ... a topic will bring me to rarely see a dramatization of real events or public figures in film. I actually loved this movie for its glossy overdramatization in grand Hollywood style. This is truly an adaptation and not reflective of all the facts but that's expected. Yet, it was fun and so ""Hollywood"" in a charmingly formulaic way. How to turn a hostage crisis into a feel good flick -- only Hollywood and especially Ben Affeck can do so well! Being a patriot I tend to appreciate any interpretation of history long needing to be revealed. I would have given 10 stars if available for the bonus mini-documentary of interviews with the real players in this rescue mission -- and also the credits that closed the film beautifully with a dedication to Tony Mendez's deceased son, IAN who passed away in 2010 of cancer. Enveloping in now: a quote from a Washington Post article including an interview with Tony Mendez (the real operative.) Here's a quote from the man himself! ...""Oh, absolutely, it brought back the emotions,"" said Tony Mendez, a retired disguise specialist in the CIA's office of technical service. ""I went to screenings in [Los Angeles] and Toronto, and it was just like being there again. Both times. ""There's nothing so final as `Wheels up.' [On missions], we always were waiting for that wheels-up feeling before we broke out the Bloody Marys."" ...

It's a great premise and offers a lot of natural tension and drama, and for that I appreciate them making a narrative from it.  But then on top of that, they chose to make it in this understated way with that shoestring budget aesthetic and it becomes a little bit like, ""maybe this should've just been a lifetime movie.""  It didn't help that I wasn't quite sure why I was supposed to have sympathy for the six ""protagonists"" who were whiny and inexplicably mistrusting of their only option.  And to see the actual performances after their nominations I was sort of like, ""eh?""  This was a classic case of overhype as a result of an indie film winning awards by far exceeding its wildly low expectations.",1364860800,,810,4.482993197278912
4873316,4,B005S9ELM6,"Argo begins with a comic-book style sequence imparting the basics of modern Iranian history.  I was pretty impressed, because if there is one thing I've learned from FLCL, comic-book style sequences are hard to animate.

The Argo leaps into a riveting sequence, when a mob of students breaks into the US Embassy in Tehran - and six employees in a side building manage to escape the hostage situation.  They find refuge with the Canadian ambassador and the CIA decides extracting them isn't a priority.  Then the situation changes.  And no one has a clue how to get them out.  Their best idea?  Create a fake movie and say the six are a film crew scouting locations.

Argo does a good job of keeping the tension high, but not so high that the movie is a pain to watch.  There are spots to breathe.  Even before Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) goes to Hollywood, there's humor in the scene where the State Department presents their ideas for extraction to the CIA.  But the majority of the humor does come from the Hollywood scenes.

I particularly enjoyed how Argo used period music.  Films set in the seventies tend to go for the same songs.  It's a storytelling crutch nowadays.  Those recognizable bits of classic rock are there, but they tend to punctuate a scene instead of playing out over an action montage.  Late in the movie one song is allowed to play on, and I'm not sure whether I like it or not.  The song is perfect for the scene, but the lyrics are so on the nose that it's hard not to feel like you're being nudged with the clue hammer.

I find the real story behind Argo fascinating.  I knew about the Iranian Hostage Crisis from school - and my mom from being alive in 1979 - but I'd never heard about the six.  I enjoyed reading up on the situation and finding out what was real and what was invented to make the movie more dramatic.  Honestly, I think the movie could've dialed back on the invention a hair and been even better.  Many of the added bits stuck out as artificial, messing with the movie's realistic tone.

I liked Argo because it's a fascinating story and it was told with style, humor, and urgency.  I can't say whether it deserved to win the statue since I haven't seen many of its competitors yet, but I don't think it's a film someone would regret watching.  And it's kind of sad that the Argo cover film was never to be because it sounds like something I would love.",1364860800,,2398,4.432494279176201

ARGO was a pretty good movie... Never mind that the whole rescue deal was a Canadian effort, not American... and that it wasn't THAT close... and the Shaw the movie said the US ""installed"" in 1953 had actually been Shaw since 1941... the real movie script wasn't a sci fi... there was no ""last minute approval"" by Carter, he'd already greenlighted it... there was no chase at the airport, and even if there were it would be highly unlikely the Iranians would be driving AMERICAN MOTORS MATADOR model police cars, and even if that were true they would never have kept up with the airliner on the runway which would have been doing about 185mph to achieve takeoff...

Having said this, I would like to stress that this is my personal opinion ONLY and therfore I may say that I was utterly bored.

Ben Affleck's masterpiece has every right to go down in history as a film with a controversial subject (US-Iranian relations), set in period (1979-80), that still managed to be funny and edge-of-your-seat intense.  And that doesn't happen by accident.  The Academy honored all of the right individuals, except for Ben.  It won for screenwriting and editing.  Great story, and great pace.  Those guys were at the top of their game.  Anyway, I highly recommend this film.

4873402,4,B005S9ELM6,"Ben Affleck acts as Tony Mendez a CIA agent who is instrumental in helping six Americans escape from Iran in 1980. In a volatile Iran, Iranian youths have stormed the American embassy compound, six embassy officials have secretly escaped and are hiding at the American ambassador's house, all they need is a plan to escape Iran. In the film,  we are witness to one of the most dramatic escape operations in the history of espionage, this was a relatively closed chapter until the Clinton Administration declassified the CIA operation. Ben Affleck who made his directorial effort worthy of the Oscars instantly becomes a worthy successor to Clint Eastwood as one of the most years.successful actor turned directors in years.

Argo is a tight well written and acted drama about a CIA operative who must hatch a plan to smuggle out the Americans that is believable to the fanatical revolutionaries. In order to gain access to Iran and credibility with the fanatics, Mendez uses his hollywood contacts with the help of Lester Siegel, a film producer and John Chambers, a makeup artist to create a fake science fiction film production. A production that will certainly seem believable, so a fake science fiction film is concocted with the name Argo.

Argo creates tension at the right places and is evenly paced. Even though the story of the film plot is ridiculous, the CIA had no trouble fooling the Iranians. The acting is great thanks to a great cast comprising John Goodman, Alan Arkin and Bryan Cranston. five stars 3/28/2013",1364774400,,1526,4.929961089494164

I was a teenager when this event was happening so this movie brought back some memories and reminded me that in many ways, we are still at war. Some things never change, I guess. Anyway, for the rental price I found it to be a great value in entertainment. If I had paid $12-$15 to see it at a theater, I would not have felt the same value.

Everyone knows Iran is a lovely place to visit and the people are still warm and friendly towards Americans, especially in the summer.

4873450,2,B005S9ELM6,"ARGO, directed by and starring Ben Affleck, receiving rave reviews all across the board, has the makings of a great story - not only because it's a true one.

Declassified by the CIA since the nineties, dealing with the 1979 Iran Hostage Crisis, it's not the Embassy hostages we're centering on. There were six people who stealthily escaped the takeover, hiding in the Canadian ambassador's house. The CIA is at a loss - they have only one idea concerning bicycles and it's not very bright.

Enter Affleck's Tony Mendez: we first see him waking up with an empty beer can on his dresser, so he's got the makings of the typical maverick hero. While watching BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES on TV, Tony has an idea - become a producer of a bogus science fiction movie and, scouting a location in Iran, get the Americans out.

A fantastic premise and an opportunity to blend classic cult films with a modern thriller... And with John Goodman (as a makeup artist) and Alan Arkin (as a wry producer) on board the Hollywood end, ARGO just can't miss... but it does. The six people that need saving have zero personality, making it hard to feel for their plight.

Although we see clips of hangings and executions in Iran, there's hardly a vibe of impending danger or threat. While the clever aspects, mixing a fake press conference for the sci-fi flick with Iranians making real demands, are edited nicely, the movie-making scheme, which had so much potential, feels rushed. And Affleck himself lacks the edge of a central character, much less a heroic one.

The best part is the last half hour as the seven (including Mendez), using fake passports as a Canadian production crew, move through an Iranian airport for the departing plane. Despite every ""last minute"" clich&eacute; thrown in the pot, as least there's some urgency. But with a lack of interesting or involving characters leading to the escape, ARGO falls short of the immense hype.",1364688000,,1938,4.755952380952381

4873508,5,B005S9ELM6,"I really did not remember much of the actual story- i was maybe 30 when it happened and enmeshed in personal problems. so I kind of had to take the movie as it was, barely remembering that there was a 'positive' results of sorts. I know that a lot may have been fictionalized as other reviewers mentioned, however as those people lived through those days and even if a scene was 'exaggerated', it helped recreate how tense they may have actually felt.  I had to look at what I may have been like if it affected me- as any of the characters- the Iranian women on the street- the captives- the captors. somehow they portrayed people as people and that was fascinating.
It wasn't a movie that took me to a fairy tale world of escape- but I escaped my world for a while and will be thinking about that world for a while. and that is a good thing.",1364601600,,842,4.2625

The event took place in 1978. Was Honda introducing their new high performance motorcycle to the world via a country that was in the Stone Age?????,1364601600,,477,4.266666666666667

Plenty of action and suspense that made it very hard to look away. The fact the plot was ""based"" on a true story that was the ""best bad idea of the lot"" provided a comedic element to what was an incredibly tense global situation that if it failed could have led to a severe catastrophic response.

Some tremendous acting, especially by the 6 ""escapees"" as they lived with the daily fear of disclosure. Affleck continues to improve as an actor and did marvellously considering he also was director.

I so enjoyed going back to the late 70s/early 80s too with those haircuts, clothes and clunky cars.

4873541,5,B005S9ELM6,"This movie, Oscar aside, really surprised me with how well done it was. I won't say much about the movie itself, because even though it's a historical account of an actual event, it's not a well known event (at least on the personal level as this is).

This could have been chock full of violence and profanity (which I'm not saying I DON'T like by any means), but drives the message home in a far more unique way - creating a false sense of paranoia and making every other moment feel like the group is completely going to fail.

Even if you call the ending from a mile away or know what happens, it's safe to say you knew there wasn't going to be a twist. That's what was so good about this movie, I knew everything that was going to happen - but it still stressed me out beyond belief and that is what made this movie so impressive to me.

Generally 2 hours of dialogue with hardly any action would put me right to sleep, but Argo manages to break that barrier and present a great historical account in a way that makes you really feel like you were there a few decades ago. On an end note, the comparison at the end with the real people against Afflak's cast just made it all the more real.

Spectacular! Definitely worth a watch... I purchased it on release date, but it probably will be a long time to come before I watch it again - it's one of those amazing one-shot films, so a rent may be worth your money... but I do support purchasing it by all means!",1364515200,,1462,4.210714285714285

Other actors deliver 'cute' one-liners with all the timing of a T.V. sitcom. The end of the film is a series of ""cliffhangers"" of monumental artlessness. The mean airport guards scrutinize passports while the heroes sweat. The mean guards call the heroes into rooms to interrogate them while the plane is on ""final boarding"".

4873686,3,B005S9ELM6,"Argo is a feel-good actioner and as such suffers(despite opening sequence story boards describing how the present situation,the Ayotallian Revolution came to be)playing fast and loose with historical truth,grossly down playing Canadian involvement,portraying Iranian officials as childish and easily duped,distorting the rescue mission to make it seem far more nail-bitingly precarious and in the nick of time than it was. In the historical department Zero Dark Thirty stood as the year's pre-eminent political lightning rod film saddled with the burden of responsibility. The pill it was asking us to take was the torture. One film suffered the other rose,because there was no ambiguity in the portrayal of its hero,while the other introduces very dark moral ambiguities. Affleck swallowed accuracy in favour of easy-to-swallow heroics. Bigelow swallowed accuracy in favour of hard-to-swallow anti-heroics. The wider context of brutal and ignomious manipulation belongs to both films. In global power stakes America's empire since Vietnam,Iraq and Afghanistan is in decline. Argo's infelicities are conventional,creating a serviceable,feel-good cinematic narrative,telling Americans something great about themselves.

However Iranian radicals are seen as a seething rabble unjustified in its insurgence against American emissaries who helped architect the nation's slide into monarchical decadence(a scene in which the six American hostages, and Affleck,trek across Tehran in a minibus and are assailed by the Iranian protestors,rendered as an amorphous tide of generalized hostility, is head-shakingly ludicrous.)The film is brilliantly balanced between the Hollywood sections,John Goodman and Alan Arkin bringing wit and humour,concocting the faked production through Mendez of a sci-fi movie in order to rescue the 6 US diplomats from Tehran during the hostage crisis,with Affleck playing the straight man with bright ideas and daring and Hollywood contacts. On the other hand if the mission goes wrong it could lead to humiliation and death. There is great pacing and we get to know the hostages as individuals.

The Canadians took a lot of the risk of housing the hostages,drawing up faked passports,suffering the brunt of the PR flak when the hostages' liberation became headline news. Americans didn't just arrive in the nick of time to bail out the distressed,ineffectual Canadians. This is a wet dream of buccaneering foreign-policy intervention based on the pluck and gallantry of a doughty individual. Affleck is an intelligent,shrewdly commercial film-maker and has proved(if not as an actor) that he has a second life as a director with his two previous works before this. There are afterwords postscript to the film by Ken Taylor and a feature Rescued from Tehran with interviews with Jimmy Carter,Tony Mendez and the houseguests recounting their harrowing experience. Inconspicuous pop-corn flick or insidious in it breezy pleasure? Best summed up by the Hollywood's buzzwords,""Aah,go f*** yourself!""",1364428800,,3016,5.775280898876405

For me I wish they would have give a little more detail of what 'Ben Afleck's' background was before he just woke up and here we go.  All of the characters were 5-star performances and I understand completely why there were so many awards given out for this movie.
This will have you on the edge of your seats during the final episode worrying about what is going to happen.  It is to much of a cliff-hanger to divulge.  This is worth every cent you will spend.",1364342400,,631,4.26890756302521
4873753,4,B005S9ELM6,"As the parent of two children, I rarely get a chance to watch films made for adults so I was glad to find a few hours to watch this on DVD.  This based-on-a-true-story film provides fascinating insight into the real-life events that occurred when six American employees of the embassy in Iran were forced to hide out after the Iran hostage crisis of 1979-1980.

I'm old enough to remember the crisis itself when 52 employees of the American embassy in Iran were taken hostage.  What I had not heard about was the six Americans who escaped and were provided with refuge by the Canadian ambassador.  This is the story of how the CIA helped them escape from Iran by passing them off as a Hollywood film crew.

Truly, this is a story worthy of the big screen.  I strongly suspect that quite a bit of dramatic license was added to create more tension and suspense throughout the film.  In fact, a quick internet search confirms those suspicions.  Still, this is a pleasant way to pass a couple of hours . . . and learn a little history at the same time.",1364342400,,1048,4.450261780104712

This picture takes a look at the lives of six Americans who managed to distance themselves from the Iranian takeover of the US Embassy during the Revolution in 1979.

What a stunning movie.  It is unbearably tense and the ending left me breathless and in tears.  Director/Star Ben Affleck does a wonderful job and it's all the more harrowing because it's a true story.  John Goodman and Alan Arkin play Hollywood insiders and add a bit of much-needed humor in small roles.  Argo won the 2013 Best Picture Oscar and I enjoyed it very much.",1364256000,,606,4.616822429906542
4873796,3,B005S9ELM6,"Hollywood definitely likes Argo more than I do.  Don't get me wrong - I think it is a fine film with some impressive aspects, chief among them the recreation of the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Iran and the street scenes within Tehran, which is a city that few Americans ever see.  But I wouldn't rank it among the best films of the year, and I doubt that it will achieve the title of ""classic"".  Years from now, the film Argo will likely pale in comparison to other more substantial films, just as the events portrayed in Argo are but a footnote to the overall Iranian hostage crisis.

There is a simple, plausible explanation for why Hollywood is so enamored with Argo: the Hollywood filmmaking industry plays a crucial role in the storyline, and it is a role in which Hollywood literally gets a chance to save the day (and lives) and have a direct influence on political events.  In other words, Hollywood (for once) gets a chance to do some unalloyed real-world good.  But the CIA and other spy organizations create many cover stories for their agents, and the one portrayed in Argo happens to be the best alternative for the circumstances, so I felt it to be fairly logical, all things considered.

Like all movies that are ""based on a true story"", the filmmakers have a certain degree of freedom to enhance events to increase the drama, and my impression is that director Ben Affleck took advantage of that.  There are several scenes at the climax of the movie that are a bit hard to believe, two of which involve the incredibly fortunate simultaneous timing of events on opposite sides of the world, and a final chase sequence on an airport runway that is quite ludicrous.  If these events actually happened exactly as portrayed then I retract all these comments, but I think the odds are in my favor.

Argo is worth a viewing if you are at all interested in the subject matter, and in particular if you can remember the Iranian hostage crisis, but don't expect it to make your list of all-time classics.",1364256000,,2022,4.591666666666667

I know it has been out for a long time and it won awards, but I was probably one of the few people left that had not heard about it and did not know what it was about.

The beginning was very interesting but as the movie unfolded it seemed very average and formula-matic. Everyone was acting except Affleck. Seems his preparation was to grow a 70's beard and keep it after post production. If he would stop casting himself as a star in his movies perhaps the public wil pay to see it domestically. His presence really hampered my enjoyment of the film. Don't know how this average directorial piece won Oscars's best picture. Seems the Academy felt he was ""knocked down?"" Um, Knocked by whom?

As a writer I am a sucker for a good story, and this was a great story about storytelling, and the power of storytelling to enchant and manipulate. I think Louis Armstrong's quote about there being two kinds of music (good and bad) works with movies, too. They either draw you in or they don't. And each one of us is drawn by different types of stories. Is this the ""best"" picture? Who knows? But is was well written and well told in my book...",1364169600,,571,4.39622641509434

Viewing their escape was spine-tingling as they rode through the streets, while the mob literally rocked their vehicle. Even though I knew they made it out, I held my breath with them while trying to board the jet, and then while the jet raced down the runway. Even then there was fear they would be shot down over Iranian airspace. I loved it.",1364169600,,418,4.441558441558442

4874029,4,B005S9ELM6,"Way better than 0crap30 - hated that movie !
Great cast/acting and smooth storytelling. Ben ya doin good !

The only part that bothers me is that I feel this was made & released to provoke
new american anger towards Iran for current political war mongering agendas.
It's over 30 years ago, so don't let this story affect your current judgment.

Any American currently in the Mid East is asking for trouble.
They don't want us there, we have no right to be there, and we should leave.
The whole oil thing should of and could of been resolved decades ago as far as I'm concerned.
People please wake up ! get informed - research the petro dollar.
Don't let our corrupt corporate controlled government damage our country any more !",1364169600,,727,4.541984732824427

I remember the news when they came home and the reports about how Canada had brought them out of hiding so this was very interesting to me to see the behind the scenes. The Canadians put themselves in a lot of danger for our people back then just keeping them for the six weeks or so before we got our act together and got them out.

4874059,4,B005S9ELM6,"I have looked forward to watching Argo. Ben Affleck's latest film is a memorable dramatisation of the CIA's rescue of six diplomats from Iran and does a great job at providing tense dramatic action with some dark humor thrown in. Although there a few mistakes from the era that aren't totally accurate, I think Affleck does a good job at recreating the situation in the late 70's with Iran. Some with say that there is some dramatization of the CIA's role and I won't argue that, but for the most part I think it provides a good feel of the situation at that time. What true story movie doesn't take a dramatic license in story telling? The acting in this is solid and the characters look very true to the original people from the real situation. Maybe not in the league of other Oscar winners but still a good movie nonetheless.",1364083200,,829,4.496688741721854

4874091,5,B005S9ELM6,Ben Affleck did a great job in this movie.  I watched it on direct tv and had to have it.  It depicted alot of the actions that happen behind close doors of our government. These people were truly lucky that a few people in our government didn't give up on them.,1364083200,,262,4.117647058823529

4874093,2,B005S9ELM6,"A great idea for a movie, but difficult to execute.  All the ""action"" takes place largely indoors through dialogue, scary and fearful dialogue.  The screenplay has to be well written, as, say, ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" This one is not well-written.  John Houseman and Alan Arkin mail in their nearly irrelevant cameo performances.  And Ben Affleck does what handsome male leads are expected to do--appear strong, confident, yet sensitive, and courageous.  How can the Iranians not be foiled and the Americans rescued with such a hero within their borders?  Don't waste your time and money.",1364083200,,597,5.166666666666667

4874095,4,B005S9ELM6,We enjoyed Argo for the reality and information it provided.  The only reason I did not give it a 5 was the sound was irritating.  It went from high pitched to low pitch too often and we found ourselves putting the sound up and down constantly which interfered with the enjoyment.,1364083200,,280,4.470588235294118

What isn't so acceptable, though, is the video quality from amazon via Roku. It's definitely the fuzziest movie I've ever watched. Not a huge deal for me, an old timer who remembers when the best quality was so bad it made your eyes water. But, there were subtitles in it, and they were pretty close to illegible. Most of the credits at the end were completely illegible. I paid for the HD version, at that.

4874268,2,B005S9ELM6,"SOME SPOILERS - may want to read after viewing film.

Although the film is well crafted I think it does a disservice to the public understanding of the event that is the foundation of the movie. The movie is largely fiction. Jimmy Carter has said that the Canadians did 90% of the work and took 90% of the risk and he also said that he was disappointed in the movie for misrepresenting the major role of the Canadians. Too many people (especially young people) are taking this movie as a history lesson.  Some examples of rewritten history include -

The airport sequences and the visit to the bazaar are total fiction.

The passports were prepared by the Canadians after receiving special authorization from a secret meeting of the Canadian Parliament.  They were delivered by diplomatic pouch, not by Mendez.

The visas Mendez brought were badly prepared by the CIA and were corrected by the Canadians in Iran.  The mission would have failed had the corrections not been made.

The fake movie ""Argo"" was not a major factor in the mission outcome.

The airline tickets were purchased by the Canadians and there was no retraction of approval for the mission as portrayed in the movie.

The best thing I can say about the movie is that it inspired me to investigate what really happened.  I now know more than before viewing the film - so in a sense it was a positive experience.",1363910400,,1378,4.652892561983471

4874293,5,B005S9ELM6,"Based on true events of Americans who were hiding out at the Canadian Embassy.  Ben Affleck played the CIA agent who orchestrated a fictitious movie called ""Argo"" to enable these hostages to gain freedom to come back to the U.S.",1363910400,,228,4.7

4874295,2,B005S9ELM6,"I found ""Argo"" tedious. Affleck largely underplayed his part or perhaps played it in ""director mode."" He should have chosen between playing the lead and directing. There are few who are talented enough to do both well. Not until the tense scene at the end, when the fleeing ""cast"" almost misses their plane, did the movie gather some steam. But by then, if I hadn't paid to rent the movie, I would have already abandoned it.

As one who is old enough to remember the Iran hostage crisis, I was haunted by the fate of the hostages who were captured and held for so long by the Iranians. The story of ""Argo"" seemed inconsequential in comparison. The hostage crisis itself would make better subject matter for a film.",1363824000,2,714,4.578125
4874296,4,B005S9ELM6,"Anti-Spoiler: If you are unfamiliar with the story of the six American citizens who escaped from the U.S. Embassy during the hostage crisis in Tehran, 1980, it might work better if you do not read any more beforehand in order to save some element of surprise. Either way, however, ARGO is quite gripping, and the information declassified in 1997 should be significantly interesting to all. Even those who already know how the basic story comes out should find human interest and a compelling narrative in the details of how it all apparently occurred.

Many have complained that ARGO has a made-for-television feel to it. I agree, and consider that one of the film's strongest points. It's easy to understand why many who are used to today's expertly hypertech film production are disappointed or at least dismayed by ARGO's atmosphere. Its subject is neither ""current"" nor what most of us consider ""history."" Ergo, the straightforward and unsensationalized cinematography helps to capture the mood of these events and also contributes to the time setting, i.e., really harks back to 1980.

Excellent script: Especially insofar as the CIA and State Department are concerned, it made me think, ""That's how the talks must have gone."" The news bits and reenactments of the demonstrations in Tehran are equally mesmerizing. There were times when I wished for subtitles of all the chanting and other Iranian dialogue, but at the same time, I like the way ARGO allows room for anyone not fluent in Farsi to sense the gist of it all.

Though his acting performance is plastic indeed, Affleck's direction of this film is truly fine, and the acting by most of the other major players, particularly those who play the would-be hostages and those who play the various Iranians, is good and often great.",1363824000,,1791,4.983277591973244

4874322,2,B005S9ELM6,"The movie was just okay. We have all seen this script before in a thousand other movies. Although the movie's real life premise was indeed interesting, the script and directing was just unable to harness this dramatic and emotional narrative. Camera work was shaky to force tension; I hate it when novice directors do this -- it just makes viewers motion sick. Also, Ben is simply a terrible actor. He emotes nothing, and with a beard it's less than nothing. I almost felt as if there was a movie being filmed and he was silently photo-bombing every seen. They sold us this directorial masterpiece and we bought it. It just didn't even come close to a masterpiece and someone must have ""bought"" them the Oscar. Life of Pie should have been Best Picture; it out ranks this bar-none.

Altho the facts were declassified several years ago, there have always been rumors of help from our good friends, the Canadians.  To be fair, it IS possible that not all of the details were declassified, and hence the fictionalized story or even that the Canadians did not want to be put on the spot for helping us.  As we all know serving in the middle east is a dangerous place to be assigned and perhaps some secrets need to be kept.  The fault that we found was in the language, particularly with Ben Affleck.  He has been in a number of movies, beginning with ""Good Will Hunting"" and each movie has contains the F word.  It is hard to believe that Ben Affleck cannot find another word to express himself, other than the F word.  I find this a shame that I would even assume that this is a word in his daily life, exposing his little girls to such language. I would respect him more if that word was deleted.  Have we come so far as to be only be able to express ourselves in foul language?

At the time of the event depicted in Argo I was off shore in the Arabian sea on a carrier as a member of the carrier airwing fighter squadron. It was my first deployment.

Affleck and the rest of the cast put me ""there"" in the moment, moment to moment. I was again living an experience from the 70's that is still vivid in my mind today.

4874397,5,B005S9ELM6,"Argo is a fast paced thriller, but never mindless. Affleck generates the kind of sustained suspense that one associates with a caper movie, which in one sense it is. Set during the Iranian Hostage Crisis, Argo is the story of just one of the many exploits of Tony Mendez, CIA master of disguise. Mendez (Affleck) is charged with creating a cover story for the seven hostages that have managed to escape from the American Embassy during the first few minutes of the crisis. He must spirit them out of Iran under the noses of the regime, and Affleck manages to hold the tension for most of the film. Like ZDT, the final half hour is a series of synchronized moves, each of which must work. Argo is so different from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zero-Dark-Thirty/dp/B00BF11STU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zero Dark Thirty</a>&nbsp;that comparisons are useless.

My heart was even racing the last fifteen minutes of the film.  Argo is, by far, the best movie that I have seen in several years. Alan Arkin and John Goodman were fun to watch, and Ben Affleck's performance as an actor and a director was nothing short of spectacular.

Despite the bad reviews for several films he's made,  I think he has evolved into a wonderful actor and this film was no different.  Plus, he directed.  It was intense and kept my attention.  Additionally, it was a true story (not just some make believe adaptation of a ""true"" story), one I did not know had occurred (I knew the other hostages were freed at the 11th hour of President Carter's presidency, by military action from the USA, something Carter was never acknowledged for doing.)

4874533,3,B005S9ELM6,"Ben Affleck has given us a pretty good representation of a really interesting story. I watch his movies and often feel he has written his films for someone who lacks curiosity, has less than a high school education, and harbors insecurities about being an American and needs reassurance. I live in Boston, and when I watch his films about Boston, I feel like he is writing for people who harbor insecurities about being from Boston AND being from America, and need extra reassurance.

The opening narrative spoken while cartoons and a few snaps from the press sounded like it was from a seneth grade history text.

The movie is suspenseful, but dumbing down a story that begs for nuance and subtlety was too bad. Affleck does a nice turn as the lead. Alan Srkin and John Goodman are great as well.",1363651200,,797,4.6453900709219855

I highly recommend it.  I only rented the movie via Amazon Instant Video, I didn't purchase it.  Segue... I've been very pleased with Amazon Instant Video.  I have an Amazon Prime account so I watch a lot of TV shows and movies for free, but I think the $4.99 to $5.99 I pay for movie rentals is more than fair.  I normally stream through my TV, but occasionally I stream movies on my iPad.  Every once in a while I have a problem with bandwidth but that may be more of an issue with Comcast Xfinity that with Amazon.

It was action packed and it kept one guessing at what just happened. That is why I purchased the movie so as I could put it all together and understand better of how the 6 U.S. men and woman wormed their way through the area and how they narrowly got out of Iran. It was probably fictional in the response of the ending by flying out, but I do not really remember how they got out. The movie seem to of kept my mind wanting to understand the events unfolding. So much happened so fast in this true life event and then the rest of the other people spent their remaining 444 days in captivity in Iran before being released. It gives the feeling that this can happen anytime and anywhere in the world without warning. It shows you what happens to a people emotionally stable, as to what terror can do to you as time moves on with uncertainty. it shows that idle threats can be devastating to ones well being. It shows how someone, anyone with confidence can do what seems impossible. That is the American way",1363651200,,1154,4.32258064516129

4874552,1,B005S9ELM6,"Revisionist history at its worst.  The Shah of Iran was America's best ally in the Middle East.  A great reformer, among other things he took one of the most illiterate countries in the world and made it one of most educated.  He sent 100,000s of Iranians to the best schools around the world.  You could meet Iranians at almost any university.  The American Left hated the Shah.  My lefty friends were always telling me that the Shah's secret police beat up students.  'Mr. Human Rights' Jimmy Carter despised the Shah, too.  Carter famously told his Cabinet that the U.S. had nothing to fear from a non-aligned Iran.  So Carter threw the Shah under the bus, paving the way for Ayatollah Khomeini and Islamic dictatorship.  It was the happiest day of my lefty friends lives when Khomeini took over.  First the revolution killed 50,000.  Then the Islamists executed 6,000 political prisoners.  Then the Kurds tried to break free and that killed 20,000.  Then Iraq attacked and Khomeini gave the students 'Go to Heaven' passports and marched them by the 10,000s thru Iraqi minefields ahead of the Iranian army.  Every evil alluded to in this movie has Jimmy Carter's bloody fingerprints.  So when his voice-over at the end of the movie claims this partially factual story is a victory of his administration I wanted to throw up.  The Left fought for years for the overthrow of the Shah.  Spinning the resultant disaster as Jimmy Carter hero is pure Hollywood whitewash.",1363651200,18,1468,4.850806451612903

4874557,5,B005S9ELM6,"Argo is a significant film. The most important part of the film is the beginning. In the very beginning of the film, before any action starts,  the narration gives an unvarnished, brief synopsis of Iranian history for the last sixty years. The narration relates how the elected government of Mohammed Mossadegh was overthrown by American and British interests following the nationalization of Iran's oil industry. The narration also relates how the Shah of Iran was installed at the behest of the same governments, and how the Iranian peoples were violently oppressed by SAVAC, the Shah's secret police. For people in the Progressive Community this knowledge is well known and is historically undisputed. This knowledge was certainly not know by the vast majority of people outside of Iran, and most certainly not known to American citizens at the time of the Iranian Hostage Crisis. Bringing this knowledge to the open as Argo has done was a bold, if somewhat academic, move, designed to foster some degree of understanding to a misunderstood country.

While the beginning was promising, the movie quickly degenerates into a standard Hollywood political thriller. A good thriller, but one which drowns out, unfortunately, the attempt at understanding the mentality of nation which was so greatly wronged by Western powers. While the movie attempts to explain a previously unknown historical background of an important country, that message is trivialized by what is really a standard Hollywood thriller.

This movie accurately depicts the atmosphere in Teheran during the overthrow of the Shah. Speaking as someone who was passing through Teheran as a tourist on the way to India, while the movie goes a long way in giving a snapshot of the city at the time, the reality was much, much worse. Teheran  was very much a city caught in the grips of great tension, apprehension and revolutionary zeal.

The movies probably more accurately portrays the vagaries of life in the intelligence community. A telling portion of the movie is at the last portion of the film where Mendez (Afflect) is informed that he is about to receive the highest award in recognition of his work in the operation. Mendez informs his chief that he is not available on the date appointed for the ceremony. It really didn't matter, the chief indicates. Because Mendez did not officially participate in the operation which was highly confidential, indeed, since the operation did not officially exist, he would have to return the medal anyway. Such is the surreal world of intelligence work.

Unsettling, but not surprising considering the other entrants for best picture in 2013 (Zero Dark Thirty), is the degree to which the spy agencies work hand in glove with Hollywood. The entire operation which engineered the release of the embassy workers depicted in the film was the result of the real-life participation of Hollywood producers, represented by the actors Alan Arkin and John Goodman.

All things being equal, this movie conveys a better message than Zero Dark Thirty, which appears to have been scripted by the Defense Department. If the movie viewing public does not get mesmerized by the standard Hollywood shtick which is undeniably present in the film, Argo will go a long way towards creating understanding between this country and Iran.",1363651200,,3323,5.131238447319778

The Affleck character takes this task upon himself, not knowing whether or not he can pull it off; and the six Americans not knowing if the Affleck character can really get them out.  This film cuts to our own emotions of whether to trust ourselves and someone else with our lives--whether we should follow someone else's directives during a crisis or not.

4874573,5,B005S9ELM6,"Argo is Ben Affleck's third movie he has directed and he is 3 for 3. This movie deals with the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis in which Iranian revolutionaries stormed the American Embassy and took everyone hostage, but six managed to escape. The movie focuses on  getting those six out before they are captured and executed.

The movie begins with a brief history of the region, and how the US and British government had controlled the country and its resources for decades until Iran revolted and forced the Western designated Shah out, but now demanded he return and face punishment. After taking the embassy the CIA comes up with a plan to get the six out. Tony Mendez, the operative who orchestrated the plan, comes up with an idea to create a fake movie and have the six pose as film crew and ultimately get out of the country.

The acting is very solid, Ben Affleck and Bryan Cranston do great jobs as the CIA agents fronting this mission. John Goodman and Alan Arkin are also great as the movie producers fronting the fake movie.

The last half hour of this film is very intense and nerve wracking, and it will have you on the edge of your seat. All said and done this is a fast two hour movie that is never boring. Do give this movie a view if you want to watch a great thriller.",1363564800,7,1284,4.405063291139241

I've heard comments made on TV about how this movie was historically inaccurate and how it was the Canadians who did 90% of the work of getting the hostages back from Iran.  While this may be true, I say to those people - WHO CARES?  This movie is fast-paced, exciting, funny, and riveting.

Ben Affleck does a great job of acting in and directing the movie, and the plot is great.  I just loved the performances by John Goodman and Alan Arkin, and wished they had larger parts.  The scenes in Iran were striking and kept you on the edge of your seat.  How could anyone argue that the final portion of the movie, as the hostages were leaving Iran, wasn't utterly engrossing?  I guess you knew in the end what was going to happen, but it was a great ride getting there.

In the age of historically-based films, and especially those that rely on recent events (Zero Dark Thirty is another one that fits this bill), it is really nice to go to theater, watch a movie, and get genuine, unadulterated entertainment.  And that's what Argo gives you.  If I had been an Academy Award voter, this one would have gotten my vote - hands down.

If you are a person who revels in the details of a movie, and enjoys picking apart the plot, don't see this one.  But if you are just out for fun and entertainment, make Argo the top of your list.",1363478400,,1380,4.34375

However, I can easily understand why the Iranians were pissed at us.  Nonetheless, this was a great movie, and I can easily see why it won Best Picture.  Too bad Ben Affleck didn't get Best Director, but this was still a coup for him as well as George Clooney.  The story is well written and the suspense is awesome.

4874804,1,B005S9ELM6,"This from TV3 News in New Zealand

""Movie star Ben Affleck's latest role in a film about the Iranian hostage crisis paints an untrue picture of New Zealand history.

Argo  documents the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis where six US embassy staff were smuggled out of Tehran disguised as a film crew.

New Zealand's ambassador in Iran at the time, Chris Beeby, and second secretary Richard Sewell secretly helped the staff escape by providing food and entertainment as they sheltered at the Canadian embassy. They also provided a safe house.

However, the film depicts New Zealand as turning away the US diplomats, something which has troubled Affleck.

""I struggled with this long and hard because it casts Britain and New Zealand in a way that is not totally fair,"" he told Time Out.

The film also says the British embassy turned away the US when in fact they were initially sheltered there before being moved to the Canadian embassy.

The hostage crisis began in November 1979 after a group of militants and students took over the US embassy, holding 52 Americans hostage for more than a year.

Failed negotiations and a failed rescue mission ensued the following year before a deal was reached in January 1981 and the hostages were released.

However, six US diplomats evaded the crisis and were smuggled out to the Canadian embassy, given Canadian passports and flown to Switzerland.

Mr Beeby and Mr Sewell played an important role in getting the diplomats to Switzerland.

Mr Sewell drove the group to the airport to catch the plane to get them out of Iran.

Mr Beeby also rented a property which could serve as a safe house if the US diplomats were discovered at the Canadian embassy.

The actions of the Kiwi diplomats are chronicled in a book by Robert Wright about the ordeal called Our Man In Tehran.

New Zealand's role was kept quiet because Iran was the biggest market for lamb exports at the time.""",1363478400,20,1909,4.777439024390244
4874805,1,B005S9ELM6,"Review contains spoilers:

People tend to believe at least some of what they see at a movie ""based on a true story"", especially when Ben Affleck was telling anyone and everyone that Argo was based on a true story, or ""a true story""  while promoting this film.  Please read ""The House Guests"" to get an accurate account of the 6 refugees that hid at the Canadian ambassador's house during the Iranian hostage crisis. If you want to watch a movie about this event, try to find a copy of The Canadian Caper"", it was a made for TV movie put out  in 81(?) and far more accurate, better and interesting than Argo was.

 Yes. the fake movie Argo was the cover story for the refugees being in Iran. The 6 house guests never had to use this cover story at the airport. The refugees also had 2 sets of airline tickets, one for the final destination of Canada, and one for England, There were no last minute computer checks to verify airline tickets. There is no evidence that the Iranians spent massive amounts of time putting together shredded documents found at the U.S. embassy. The Brits did not turn the 6 away, they kept them safe for as long as possible.  The flight took off smoothly, with no police cars chasing  the airplane and shooting at it. If you're flying a plane and people start shooting at that plane, what will you do, land? Even in the land of make believe any sane pilot would continue to fly out. Perhaps a better way of producing this fiction would be to have the control tower call the plane back to the ground. There was no evidence that the  Iranians spent any time putting together shredded documents showing faces of the refugees.

The fact is, had the U.S. not been involved at all, the outcome would have been exactly the same for the 6 house guests. Canada, and New Zealand (mostly Canada)  did everything of consequence to get the refugees out of Iran.  Everything the U.S. did in the movie Argo to get the hostages out was either  a complete fabrication, or at the end of the day made no difference in getting the refugees out of Iran.

There are so many interesting facts that could have been put into the movie to make it more realistic. For example, one of the check points at the airport was unmanned. The refugees could have claimed ignorance that they were supposed to go to 2 counters  and moved straight to the departure lounge,  They even discussed doing that. How would they know an unmanned counter would be important, or even notice it? They decided not to do that, and waited for a sleepy old clerk  to come out from his back office where he was making himself tea. This man didn't match up the yellow slips with the white slips, and sent the refugees to the departure lounge without incident. That would have made the movie much more ""human"",  believable and interesting. But no, Ben Affleck and the people who wrote the screenplay  would have none of that.

These are only some of the reasons I think the screenplay is for this movie is extremely bad.",1363392000,20,2990,4.481549815498155

John Houseman and Alan Arkin deserve the pre-Oscar buzz, but it is a Ben Affleck triumph.  I had almost forgotten how frightening the hostage-taking was, but the movie brought back the country's frustration, fear of reprisal, and burgeoning re-birth of patriotism While justified in their minds, I found it sad that the new powers in Iran adopted the brutality of the deposed Shah.  His long history of abuse and inhumanity needed to be exposed to the world.  Unfortunately, while our leaders had a moment in time to condemn his behavior, they turned their backs and laid the foundation for the existing hatred for the US that fuels Middle Eastern terrorists.

4875039,3,B005S9ELM6,"This film was really overhyped. Why did this win Best Picture instead of Life of Pi? It's a moderately interesting action flic, laced with inside-baseball joking references to the Hollywood scene - presumably the members of the academy found those to be immensely amusing, though I just found them to be tiresome distractions in the dialog. The hostages come across as complete twits not deserving of being saved - why the hell did they let the intruders enter without a fight? They then proceed to whine and quake in their boots when a way out is offered - one that might actually have an element of risk to their worthless persons. Aside from the protagonists being totally unsympathetic, the action was slow and unengaging. The makers of this films should have studied the Bourne movies to see how to do an action scene.

I also found the political spin irritating. At the end the message scrolls that the hostages were released on Jan 20, 1981 as if Carter finally achieved success. It was not mentioned that that date was the inauguration day of Reagan as the new US president and the Iranians were afraid to antagonize the new man who might actually have cajones, unlike the sniveling Carter.",1363219200,,1198,4.759615384615385

In the movie, Ben Affleck and George Clooney show their audience how the CIA devised a covert operation to retrieve 6 diplomats who were able to escape during an Iranian raid on the U.S. Embassy.  The head of the operate was privately recognized within the CIA for his intelligence and commitment to serving the United States without harming diplomatic relations.

4875043,5,B005S9ELM6,"I watched this movie with my family and we all LOVED it!  It's a movie version of the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis.  I remember that event very well, having lived through that period.  Critics have complained that Ben Afflect demonized the Iranian people in this movie.  I disagree.  I thought he did a pretty accurate picture of the people in Tehran at that time.  The Iranian people's anger at the U.S. for allowing their former King, the Shah of Iran, to be in our country for medical reason came through the nightly news exactly as shown.  (Of course, the Iranian people had their reason for being angry with the Shah, but that's another story.)

Ben Afflect did a wonderful job directing this movie.  The script moved and the casting was great, but keep in mind that this is a movie.  The concept of creating a fake movie to be carried out by the CIA agent, Tony Mendez (Ben Afflect), was real.  All the other stuff (i.e. procuring the passports at the last minute, the airport chase, etc, etc) never happened.  But it made for a good thriller and kept us at the edge of our seats!  This DVD also has a special feature with the REAL 1979 hostages alongside the actors recalling their experiences.  It was fun to see them side-by-side.

This covert operation was classified until much later when the information was released to the public and was picked up Joshua Bearman from the WIRED magazine in 2007.  We now know that we owe our gratitude for the safe return of the American hostages to Tony Mendez and to the courageous people who worked in the Canadian Embassy in Iran.  This movie does not take away from that fact.

I read in the news that the CURRENT Iranian government is considering suing Argo for making them look bad.  If they want to sue anyone for making them look bad, then they need to sue themselves.  Most of the Iranian people are intelligent, kind, and hard working.  They are not all religious fanatics.  (I know this for a fact.)

Since my family and I spent two years in Iran just before the fall of the Embassy, this was very real to me.  There is no surprise in it being the Oscar picture.",1363219200,,466,4.202247191011236
4875247,2,B005S9ELM6,"I must admit that I have not yet seen this film - not of all it. After half an hour of nauseating unhistorical propaganda, I felt that I had had enough. Despite the forty million or so budget, it appears that the film was set in controlled locations - reminiscent of  the typical stage sets supposed to represent 'hostile middle Eastern' countries that are shown in a typical episode of the TV series NCIS Los Angeles.
  Apart from the fact that this film insults allies of the U.S (Britain and Canada- by misrepresenting their roles in the affair), there are other inaccuracies. The USA has often made a point that its embassy everywhere in the world is the same as US soil. Nobody could refute this. Indeed, this principle well applies to all embassies everywhere. However, history has made some Iranians (and other people) think that certain guest nations in their countries have gone beyond this. They have not only regarded  their embassy as native soil - but rather, they have sometimes regarded the country in which their embassy is situated as American soil as well.
  Although America is often dependant on British support, there is no country more 'fanatical' in its celebration of independence than America when it comes to celebrating its independence from British sovereign rule. The Americans were completely right to want independence from a British monarch. So why,then, two centuries later, should they impose a monarch on the Iranian people! The oppressed Iranian people had a right not to want the shah and the brutal western-backed SAVAK that supported him.
  Extreme situations have often precipitated extreme responses. There were many who were against the storming of the American Embassy (including the current prime minister of Iran). It is possible that the interference of  the CIA against the Iranian Revolution made some Iranians distrust the American presence - as if it were some kind of Trojan Horse. They did not bomb the embassy; they stormed it and took hostages. Perhaps the cynic would remark that many countries also make hostages out of their OWN citizens - whenever and wherever there is poverty and injustice. A person with the 'wrong' skin colour, who is deprived of social welfare, education, state benefits and free health care is also a hostage! And this kind of hostage has a worse predicament - as there is no possibility of ransom.
  Although I can understand the motivation behind the Iranian revolutionaries, I condemn their taking of hostages. However, it is a sad irony to postulate that those hostages actually guaranteed Iran's safety. No sooner had the hostages been released than America incited Saddam Husein to wage war. Enough misery was caused as a result of this war and films like this do not contribute anything positive by misinterpreting history. Perhaps,however, there will be one good outcome of this film: The Iranians have promised to respond with their own version. I shall look forward immensely to a film which will provide a completely different treatment of these sad events. Like many masterpieces of the Iranian cinema, I expect it to be art - a work of art (not low-quality entertainment) that will deal with a painful episode of history with the sensitivity it deserves.",1363219200,,3248,4.996296296296296

Well we were excited to watch it at home but glad to only pay the rental rather than waste the price of tickets.  The acting was pathetic and the story line predictable.  It was not worthy of an academy award.  Both Lincoln and Silver Linings Playbook were much better movies.",1363132800,,433,4.3625
4875295,5,B005S9ELM6,"This film is a complex and complicated story.

The first thing to say is that the acting is good, very good, contrasting the tense situation, nerve-breaking actually, and the very calm behavior of most of the six hostages and the placid looking behavior of the CIA agent. Not to speak of the tremendous mental tension of most of Iranian people at the airport and the extreme excitation of some in the bazaar and most of the revolutionary guards. That is well done and very effective for us to believe we are in a real situation and not in some James Bond film.

Then the story itself is a very sorry episode of Iranian history, when the Islamic revolution succeeded against the corrupted regime of the Shah who had taken over after the ousting of Mossadegh who had nationalized Iranian oil. The film forgets to insist on the fact the CIA had heavily helped in the coup d'&eacute;tat that ousted the elected Prime Minister. That would have shown how there was a time before 1975 and another after 1975. Before 1975 the US played the cop of the world and after the defeat in Vietnam they became more humble, though not that long. Reagan brought the pride out again. That's what is more or less forgotten in the film that pretends to speak of real events.

The film though is quite good at showing the enormous change that started after 1975. In twenty years the world was to be completely transformed. The defeat in Vietnam caused the emergence of strong movements negating imperialism. Iran was one of these though it was hijacked by the hyper fundamentalist clerics of Iranian Islam who imposed a violent revolution with all kinds of coercion against the people who resisted the strict application of Islamic laws, and of course against Americans.

The strangest evolution was still to come yet since all those who stuck to a non-market economy were to fall down the historical chute, the flushing chute. The Soviet Union and all their Eastern European block were the first victims and they just fell into the free market economy with a great splash in the world's attentive tension. China felt the trend and changed their policy at the end of the 1970s and we know what happened next. The world was to be completely restructured and economic power was to be completely reshuffled and redistributed.

That's in these transitory years of 1979 to 1981 that the hostage crisis in Iran took place. The US embassy was taken over by the revolutionaries and the American personnel was taken hostage, but six had escaped and found refuge at the Canadian Ambassador's residence. The film concerns these six who were in great danger. They were retrieved by a CIA agent sent there as a film producer with the complicity and help of some Hollywood people. That's another change taking place in the USA this time: Americans were ready to serve, even if it was not exactly very good for their public images. Hollywood was on the patriotic side after having been widely against the Vietnam war.

That's what I like in this period and in this film. You feel the world is tilting in a different direction though the film does not explain which one since the past is not examined and the future is not even hinted at. But we feel more than perfectly that in-between spirit and atmosphere. The Americans are on the run but they are no longer defeated. They are pulling back in order to revamp their forces. But fear is their basic emotion and that too is a good thing about this period. Fear had changed sides and the USA have had to reconquer their stamina and to try to start getting rid of their arrogance and absolute certainty to be right above all others.

Just to see the ""Burbank Studios"" logo on the Warner Brothers water tower was a brilliant piece of time travel.  And what about those scenes at Zsa Zsa's house!  It's like Hal Ashby and Sydney Pollock meet the Coen Brothers-- and it works.  (Alan Arkin deserved the Oscar more than did the film itself.)  Of course the climactic airport scene with its 1940s South Asian goons chasing our Yankee heroes is vomit-worthy (not to mention one of the worst examples of jingoism since Kermit Roosevelt toppled the Mossedeq regime!)  But who cares when we're pulling out of Afghanistan having saved the Hindu Kush for the gipper and want to pretend that our foreign policy of the past 60 years hasn't really been any worse than...say...that of Genghis Khan.

A great film?  Hardly.  A great film is ""Pather Panchali (the greatest perhaps),""  ""Vertigo,""  ""Rules of the Game,""  ""Divorce Italian Style,""  ""Stagecoach,""  ""2001,""  ""Walkabout,""  ""Nights of Cabiria,""  ""Persona,""  ""Notorious,""  ""His Girl Friday,""  ""Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie,""  ""Ran,""  ""On the Waterfront,""  ""Empire Strikes Back,""  ""Apocalypse Now,""  ""Murmur of the Heart""  or David Lean's ""Great Expectations.""

Likewise, the voice-over bit with Jimmy Carter just before the credits made no mention that the 52 embassy hostages were released on the day that Ronald Reagan became President -- Carter seems to take credit for their release.  Hardly.  The complete fiction of the airport scene (none of this ever happened -- the six ""Argonauts"" simply boarded the airliner without threat, delay or further incident) is an insult to history that was added by the film-makers for dramatic effect.  Puh-leeze.  This story could have been told honestly, with better drama centered on the reality of the situation in Iran, with better acting and more intelligent dialog.  Instead, we get a puerile political lecture, thinly-drawn characters and fictional chase scene (cars vs. a Swissair 747).  Academy award for best film?  Really?",1363046400,,921,5.347222222222222

4875405,4,B005S9ELM6,"Well, this really will be a needle in a haystack of reviews. On the whole, the film isn't bad -- it's well produced, with an eye for period detail and excellent casting. The actors are all fine, with Bryan Cranston and the six diplomatic escapees-in-hiding turning in particularly excellent performances. Kyle Chandler bears a remarkable resemblance to Hamilton Jordan. The sense of constant but not always nail-biting tension is maintained expertly, even though you know they're all going to get out. There are a couple of flaws, in my estimation: First, as an historical film the movie ignores or distorts real events and people. Second, the hairbreadth escape at the very end is, I'm sure, manufactured just for the sake of the film and strikes me as quite artificial and overly melodramatic. To be honest, I don't think this deserved the Oscar for Best Picture. Still, it's a good picture and worth seeing.",1363046400,,910,4.954248366013072

4875450,3,B005S9ELM6,"Relatively good acting and compelling story. My problem is the infusion of political spin to minimally criticize the total ineptitude of the Carter administration in handling the situation.  Moreover, the end of the movie includes dialog by Carter on how wonderful his diplomacy was to allow the release of the hostages.  Simply, the hostages were released on Reagan's inauguration day 1981 because the Iranians knew that the proper methods would be used to extract our citizens!  Moreover, the filmmakers try to denigrate the Shah to somehow justify the takeover of the embassy.  I look forward to Affleck's future movie on Benghazi!",1363046400,,634,5.247524752475248

4875452,4,B005S9ELM6,I'm OK with the loose treatment of the facts of the actual event.  Affleck's direction of the reluctant hostage and the hangtime of the phone call from the airport to Hollywood were keys to the stress level.,1363046400,,207,4.594594594594595

I'm old enough to remember the era first hand, so I expected to have a deep understanding of the respective time and culture.  I did.  But, there was just no visceral connection on any emotional level.  Although the tempo is paced nicely the plot seems very predictable and ""rehearsed.""  There is no meat on the bone.  Affleck walks through the film without any significant emotional display, failing to ramp up the fear and dread that the captives must have experienced.  The actors playing the captives do a good job of expressing their tension, and the woman playing the Iranian housekeeper does a good job in her one good scene.  Why weren't these characters explored on a deeper level?  Alan Arkin and John Goodman in support keep the tale interesting and entertaining and Bryan Cranston gives an outstanding performance, providing the film's only moments of genuine pathos. To me this typical of Ben Affleck's work:  slick, handsomely produced and well-crafted, but lacking any emotional core or raw energy.

4875855,1,B005S9ELM6,"I was looking for a little more than what this movie was about.  Being old enough to remember all of this situation and following it through my younger years, this movie was totally incomplete. The story about how the entrance into Iran was OK, but the rest of the movie left little to be desired.

The Quality of the Blu-ray was grainy and terribly produced. I don't know if I got a bad disc, but I have DVDs that have better quality than this Blu-ray. Additionally, the movie had a very bad lip sync problem.  Even with my DVDO, I could not get the lip sync right. I was near right at a + 5ms, in my OPPO BD-93, but still bad enough, that I took it out of my OPPO BD-93 and put it in my Pioneer Elite Blu-ray player, to no avail. The picture was still grainy and the lip sync still bad enough that it took a + 6ms increase in the audio delay from my DVDO to make it watchable. That is still an ongoing issue with blu-ray movies, and you would think after all the years blu-ray has been out, they would finally be able to sync the sound with the movies. Most of the time it is OK, but every now and then, you get one like this. That is why I am still angry that HD DVD lost that format war, because the HD DVD was a much better format.

Back to the movie; if you want to see this movie, wait till yo can get it in the Wal-Mart $5 bin, or buy the DVD or stream it, but not only would I not recommend this to a friend, I would not even recommend it to my enemies.

Update: went back to Best Buy and exchanged it.  Same problem.  Lip sync terrible and grainy picture. Took it back and got the DVD, and it was better than the Blu-Ray. Lip sync to only+ 1 Ms to sync, but Blu -ray has a problem.",1362873600,8,1691,3.941348973607038

4875898,4,B005S9ELM6,"Why you shouldn't see it:

The strength of Argo also happens to be its weakness. More so than a lot of modern Hollywood fare, this is a film about its story, and that story is about people in a not envious situation. It has been branded as a ""thriller,"" but despite a riot at the beginning and some brief ""action"" at the end, the majority of this movie's ""thrills"" and plot advancement are presented in the form of dialog and tense expressions. Accordingly, if you aren't one to care about the story of a hostage crisis in the early 80's, you probably won't care about this movie, since there isn't much in the way of real exciting set pieces or even off-color moments to take your mind off of the tension of it all.

As I'm sure you're aware, Argo is based on true events. I can't speak for everyone, but movies that are supposed to have any relation to true events can make me uncomfortable. Did you know that Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Silence of the Lambs were both ""inspired by"" the same events? I'm a big fan of getting things right if you're going to try to tackle actual history, or you may as well just make up your own story and let it succeed (Silence of the Lambs) or fail (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) on its own merits. I can't speak for the veracity of any of these true events, since they're based on a top secret operation that no one even knew about until 20 years after it happened. Even now most people just remember the events surrounding this movie and not the events of the movie itself. That can be a smart move by a filmmaker, as it means you can tell the story how you think it needs to be told. On the other hand, it can be a risk, because you're telling a story about which no one necessarily cares.

Why you should see it:

Ben Affleck. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, ""Blake, I've seen Ben Affleck, and I've seen enough Ben Affleck."" Well you're kind of missing the point. Honestly, he does a fine job acting in Argo, though I wouldn't say his work is anything special. But did you know that Affleck also directs movies? He has only directed two movies (Gone Baby Gone and The Town) previous to this one, but I wouldn't rate either of them below ""very good,"" and this one follows in their quality footsteps.

I just finished saying that Argo is about very little other than its story about people talking about a stressful situation. To further complicate the task for the filmmaker, everyone already knows how the story ends. And yet, despite these handicaps, Affleck somehow makes a suspenseful movie! There was a woman next to me in the theater, saying things aloud to the screen, along the lines of, ""No, don't go through that door!"" It's hard to explain how exactly this suspense is pulled off, but I think it has mostly to do with skilled actors playing identifiable characters in intimate settings. When the embassy gets stormed, you feel like you're about to get blindfolded and gagged by the mob yourself. When Affleck's Mendes is talking to Cranston's O'Donnell about how six Americans are about to get lynched for no good reason (depending on your viewpoint, I guess), you feel like you're standing right there next to them.

Speaking of Affleck and Cranston, it's possible I didn't give enough credit to the former earlier. The role of Mendes as a character is to be the steadying force for the rest of the characters and story, and he performs that role admirably. Because Affleck is able to pull this off, the character actors like Cranston, Goodman, and Arkin are able to present their own characters as the film's much needed engaging changes of pace. That being said, the highlights of the movie as far as entertainment factor goes are definitely those very same character actors. Their interplay with each other and Affleck is always worthy of screen time, and I spent a good deal of the movie waiting for the next time one of them would pop up.

In Short:

As you may remember me saying before, this movie isn't about anything more than a fairly straightforward story, so you're left at the end of it wondering in part what the point was. But I will say that the ability of the filmmakers to take a story that everyone knows the ending to and turn it into a suspense thriller is, well, impressive. Honestly, Ben Affleck as a capable storyteller doesn't come as a surprise, as he has a - admittedly limited - pedigree of making quality films. To make this particular quality film, he successfully turns an otherwise straightforward story into one of entertaining and empathetic characters in a surprisingly suspenseful situation. As far as talking movies go, I rate this one as an 8 out of 10, and I recommend it for anyone who can appreciate a good historical suspense/thriller/drama.

Exceptions to the recommendation:
- if you have had too much Ben Affleck;
- if you positively identify with revolutionary Iran;
- if you have incredibly sensitive ears;
- anyone for whom suspenseful situations lead to nothing more than stress and high blood pressure;
- individuals who would like to go on thinking that the ""Canadian Caper"" was, in fact, Canadian;
- if you prefer to keep Hollywood as far as possible away from your understanding of historical events;
- people who would like to remain blissfully unaware that Ben Affleck is a worthwhile Hollywood type when placed safely behind the camera.",1362873600,,5353,4.620399579390115

The dialogue is clever and very entertaining.
Ben Affleck is intense and riveting. I can't stop watching him as he calmly takes six hostages through a maze of dangerous and life-threatening situations. The script is perfect. Not a wasted word. Alan Arkin and John Goodman are hilarious as the two movie moguls who help Tony create a fake movie as a cover for the six hostages. The six Americans are to become a Canadian film crew as Tony leads the through the maze of Iranian soldiers with guns who hate Americans and want to kill all of them. This is a film not to be missed.

4875921,5,B005S9ELM6,"Ben Affleck's reputation as a director continues to rise. This time he has tackled a story based on an amazing true event: The audacious rescue of six Americans who found shelter in the Tehran home of the Canadian Ambassador at the height of the Iranian Revolution in 1979. An outrageous scheme involving a fake movie with a fake Canadian crew sent to scout fake locations for a fake sci-fi film, ""Argo,"" was cooked up by a CIA disguise and exfiltration specialist, who, by the way, served as a real-life consultant on this R-rated thriller.

These guys make this a nail-biter:
  * Ben Affleck (""The Town"") is Tony Mendez, the actual hero of this outlandish story, so unbelievable it has to be true. Affleck almost overdoes the way he underplays his role.
  * Bryan Cranston (""Drive"") is Jack O'Donnell, the profane boss back at Langley, trying to bridge the divide between the needs of his agent in the field and the incredulity of his superior officers.
  * Alan Arkin (""City Island"") is Lester Siegel, a product of Hollywood: caustic wit, jaundiced world-view, and a world-class BS artist.
  * John Goodman (""The Artist"") is make-up expert John Chambers, ever the sarcastic conniver, he is Mendez's link to the make-believe world that is essential to the success of this haywire idea.
  * Victor Garber (LOTS of TV) is Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor who, along with his courageous wife, shelters these terrified refugees week after week. You may be sure the American press remembered to thank Canada for this one!

The cast is full of familiar faces, but the six hostages look distractingly real. Director Affleck's flawless blend of newsreel footage, video clips and staged riots make for a white-knuckle experience. Our exhausted screening audience applauded the end, but stayed for the VERY welcome postscripts about the participants.

This is an excellent film based on a painful time in the recent past that many of us remember very, very well. I found the rioting populace to be particularly upsetting. To me, any gathering of fifty or more people is only half-a-zealot away from being a mob, so Affleck had me right where he wanted me! This one is confidently directed and capably acted; who could ask for anything more!

Movie like this usually do not score more then a 2 stars as a ""mathematical average"" 4 here?... Why?  Full of inaccuracies, boring, self-referential.

The directors, producers, script writers etc of this movie just proved that great movies can be made without all the cursing, sex, occultism and gory violence that is pushed down our throats everytime we look for entertainment...Why can't 90% or more of our movies inspire our families like this instead of the other way around?

our freedom so highly, but these people think nothing of GIVING THEIR OWN LIVES for their country.  When you meet up with

In my opinion Affleck's directing is far above his acting in his ability to present an compelling story over a feature length time span. However, audience investment in character is lacking and we are left with a simple suspense drama, albeit entertaining but not at all worthy of an Oscar. Argo is definitely worth watching but not worth adding to a feature film library.",1362787200,,576,4.948453608247423

4876100,1,B005S9ELM6,"I probably would have never watched this movie if it had not won the 2013 Oscar for Best Picture, since for me ""Les Miserables"" was by far the most deserving movie.  Even ""Lincoln"" would have been more deserving.

So I downloaded this movie via eMule.  That's right, I wasn't going to give up any real money to watch this fraud of a movie, I just wanted to see what the hoopla was all about.  And I do believe in supporting movies that I really like, often buying all the DVD/Blu-ray, high definition etc., versions of the movies that I truly love.  ""Les Mis"" is going to get my money.

The biggest strike against ""Argo"" is that it is a completely false re-write of the real history of what happened.  Yes, Hollywood does that, and it is called artistic license, but the clear cut self-congratulatory effort to hugely inflate the role of Hollywood in the story, while downplaying the role of the Canadians and inserting false slams against some of our allies made this movie unworthy to even be considered as a Best Picture candidate.

Entertainment value?  Meh.  Just another caper movie.  Not one of my favorite kinds of movies.  Again, unworthy of a Best Picture nomination.

OK, so maybe this movie doesn't deserve a one star rating just on its merits as a mildly interesting caper movie with a terrible distortion of history, but it deserves its one star for having campaigned to get an Oscar for Best Picture.

It is simply beyond my understanding why Hollywood keeps doing this - all it does is totally discredit the Oscar award as a legitimate award with any meaning.

A previous example of the Oscar going to an undeserving picture was when ""Shakespeare in Love"" won Best Picture over  ""Saving Private Ryan"" for Best Picture in 1999.

Now, I did sort of like ""Shakespeare in Love"", but seriously, ""Saving Private Ryan""  will go down in history as a landmark war movie, one of the best of all time, whereas nobody will remember the lightweight fluff of ""Shakespeare in Love"".

A worse fate awaits ""Argo"", an utterly forgettable caper movie filled with badly re-written history, winning the Oscar for Best Picture only because of the internal politicking of the Academy and its propensity for self-congratulation.",1362787200,20,2220,4.7643979057591626

While I don't argue with the addition of dramatic flair (like police cars chasing a plane down the Tarmac--which didn't actually occur), I was offended that the very significant roles of the Canadians and British were not only minimized, but the film suggests that the Canadians only provided a ""cover"" for covert CIA action!

If you do a bit of research, you find they took A LOT of liberties with the facts of the story, and outright made up many parts. Not uncommon of course for a movie, but they really sold this a more truth than fiction. The opposite is true. But Ben Affleck is a good director, batting 3 for 3 now with each of his films.

This movie does nothing, in my estimation, to suggest Ben Affleck will ever be more than a pathetic actor with a pretty face. The scenes are rushed, barely believable, and, with the exception of a couple of scenes (short enough to nearly be considered cameos)  by Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, and very limited scenes by the lesser known actors making up the group of hostages, this movie could just as easily been performed by a B movie cast with a similar or better outcome.  The money spent for production is barely visible but enough so that it would not be considered a pure B movie.  Academy award worthy?  You have to be kidding me.

With Affleck Having directed, produced and acted in the movie I can safely say that I don't think he did a bad job at any one of them. Ok, so he has made a few duds in the past but lets not forget that Affleck has also wrote or co-wrote an Oscar winning screenplay and starred in some pretty good movies too. This movie just proves that Mr Affleck does have talent no matter what his knockers say.

The Premise

----

Argo is a dramatization of the 1980 joint CIA-Canadian secret operation to extract six fugitive American diplomatic personnel out of Iran at the height of the revolution. In 1979, the American embassy in Iran was invaded by Iranian revolutionaries and a group of Americans were taken hostage. However, six of them managed to escape in the melee and made it to the official residence of the Canadian Ambassador. Canada got in touch with the American President and he got in touch with the CIA. Many of the top brass could think of no way of getting the six Americans out of Iran safely without alerting the Iranians to their whereabouts. Tony Mendez devised a daring plan. He had worked many exfils or exfiltration exercises to great success in the past, but none quite like this one.

He came up with the idea of creating a phony Canadian film project looking to shoot in Iran and then smuggling the Americans out as part of its production crew. With the help of some trusted Hollywood contacts, Mendez created a fake promotion for a movie that didn't even exist, including actors, a screenplay and storyboards. Posters where even placed in an Iranian newspaper. Tony then proceeded to Iran as the movies associate producer. Tony was not only working against the clock but the six Americans did not think the plan could work and neither did Mendezs colleagues at the CIA.
With his plan falling down all around him Tony decides to go for broke and tries to get the six Americans off Iranian soil. He would have to fool customs and soldiers at checkpoints and the airport and hope that his colleagues back home would back up his plan.

My Thoughts

----

The direction is crisp and accomplished and not overly weighted in trying to be clever for the sake of it. There are moments when you could argue that this was the case but I think these moments work and pan out (forgive the pun). For instance, there is a steady cam shot which follows a waiter through a service hall into a kitchen that many would say he stole from Scorseses Goodfellas but the shot ends on a TV set as an Iranian woman is giving a speech relevant to that part of the movie. It is poignant and the scene delivers. It is also shot really well, so who cares if Scorsese did it first? I don't and I am a Scorsese fan; and lets make no bones about it, hundreds of directors have stolen that shot if not outright then at least in essence. The atmosphere of the movie is spot on and you would believe it is the beginning of the eighties. The cinematography is top notch and well captured by Rodrigo Prieto and the photography is faultless. Fresh from his work on Water for Elephants and We Bought a Zoo he brings a neatness to the picture that is mesmerising as well as good to look at.

So for me as a director, Affleck absolutely nailed it with this movie and he deserves every single bit of credit he gets. I felt that he almost had to apologetically receive his awards for this movie but did so in a dignified manner when inside he must have been screaming Argo **** yourself (pun intended).

That is actually a line from the movie and a joke between three of the central characters.

Affleck plays Tony Mendez who wrote the book the film was based on and also contributed to the screenplay. The book was titled The Master of Disguise and was written as Antonio J Mendez. Chris Terrio wrote the main bulk of the screenplay, using Mendezs book for reference and it was also loosely based on Joshua Berman's article in 'Wired' magazine, which was entitled 'The Great Escape'. The story was hidden from the public under the official secrets act for years but was finally declassified and written about in nineteen ninety-seven. Mendez was given the highest accolade or award possible by the CIA, the 'Intelligence Star'. Having been awarded the star in nineteen eighty-one, he was unable to receive it properly until the declassification in nineteen ninety-seven. Affleck plays the role of Mendez with an almost stoic rigidity. He is missing his son in the movie and the chance that he may not make it out of the situation alive is always hanging over the character. Many will quip at my comment and say that he is always rigid but I think he portrays Mendez perfectly and lets not forget that he is also directing this movie as well.

Jon Goodman and Allan Arkin play great parts in the movie and Arkin is his usual sarcastic character, who is almost belligerent in his fight against the suits. He plays Lester Seigel, an actor, who along with Goodmans John Chambers, a movie make-up artist, agrees to fake the movie for Mendez. These three come up with the line Argo **** yourself and use it whenever they get the chance. One of my favourite scenes in the movie is near the end when Lester turns to John and says.

Lester Siegel: The saying goes, ""What starts in farce ends in tragedy.""

John Chambers: No, it's the other way around.
Lester Siegel: Who said that exactly?

John Chambers: Marx.
Lester Siegel: Groucho said that?

The principle cast or shall we say the six hostages and the two Canadians and their maid, who shelter them from the Iranians are all good in their prospective roles. All the acting is believable and the, at times, almost documentary type feel adds even more to the realism.

It is quite ironic that you get the feeling that here is Affleck, possibly filming in Iran and having to ask permission to film about a guy who has to ask permission to film a movie in Iran. We all know that that is not true though as filming in Iran would cause problems that they could probably make a movie out of; after asking for permission of course. The movie was filmed on location in California but they did manage to shoot Afflecks visit to Istanbul in Turkey itself.

The movie worked so well for me. A lot of people will say the first hour is slow but for me, it is one of those movies that you have to pay attention to and take in every word to get it. The last 45 minutes of the movie is superb and real edge of your seat stuff. I found it captivating and knowing that it is a true story and that it really happened makes it even more remarkable.
The title 'Argo' is said to allude to Jason and his ship the Argo who went in search of the golden fleece against insurmountable odds. Most of you will know of the story, either through Greek mythology or from the movie 'Jason and the Argonauts'.

The end credits are quite poignant in the fact that the real fake passports that were used for the six Americans are shown alongside each of the actors who played the part. It is amazing how similar they look and kudos should go to the make-up and wardrobe departments for that. Then we are shown many scenes from the movie alongside actual photographs and newspaper stills that they depicted.

Due to the nature of the fake movie within the film being a science fiction movie there are a lot of references to movies from that genre. These include Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Planet of the Apes, Doctor Strange and The Valley of Gwanji.

The soundtrack is a mix of Iranian music and music that you would expect from the early eighties in America at that time. March to the Dead City from Battle For the Planet of the Apes from nineteen seventy-three is included. The Rolling Stones, Dire Straits and Van Halen make an appearance as does Concrete Jungle by The Specials. Abwoon Call to Prayer by Jahanara Laura Mangus , ""Al Adhan"" by Pat Jabbar, ""Hace Tuto Guagua"" by Tato Gomez and ""Adhan - Call to Prayer"" by Shaam make for a haunting back drop.

The movie was also known as Escape From Tehran in the US (Working Title) and as Operation Argo in Denmark, Poland, Norway and Turkey.

Its budget was forty-four million dollars and to date it has grossed about one hundred and forty and is well on the way to quadrupling its expenditure. The DVD sales will make it an even further success.

It was made at Warner Bros Pictures and runs for exactly two hours. The extended version runs for an extra ten minutes and will be made available on a special edition DVD and on Blue-ray.

George Clooney, David Klawans and Grant Heslov initially put the idea together before getting Ben Affleck to sign up as director. Alan Arkin was the first actor to be approached to star in the movie. Arkin would be nominated for an Oscar and a British Academy award for best supporting actor, although he would not be a winner. The movie did however win Oscars for the best picture, best screenplay and best editing by William Goldberg. It also won best editing, best film and Best director for Affleck at the British Academy Awards. So by definition, you could say the movie was a tad successful.

It was widely argued (mostly by Canadians) that the movie put too much emphasis on the CIA in the rescue of the six Americans and by doing so belittled the Canadians role in the operation. I think this is a ludicrous view to take as in the first place it was Mendez who dreamed this up and put it into place with the Canadian governments co-operation. Canada came out of the whole thing with glowing reports when it was declassified and the Americans took a back seat and let them basque in the glory as they were just happy that their people were safe. It is very rare that you can say the Americans took a back seat in anything but on this occasion I thought they gave great credit to the Canadians for their part in the rescue. They did indeed give refuge and a hideaway to the six Americans but it was Mendez who risked everything to get them out. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I think it is a shame that it will be lost on some without them really giving it a chance. It will also be passed over by the Affleck hate brigade without giving it much thought. All I can say to those people is that jealousy is an awful trait to own.

I think Affleck did a wonderful job on this intelligent and engaging movie and I salute him for his great effort. I hope he continues to direct as well as act because I think he will make some damn fine movies if Argo is anything to go by.

A massive thumbs up from me and I give it five out of five stars. I would recommend it to anyone who likes an intelligent movie with a little edge to it.

4876336,3,B005S9ELM6,"There is something to be said for a 'based on a true story' movie that feels like a good movie in its own right, while still hewing close to the factual truths.  'Argo' walks that line well, with good casting, plotting, humor, and suspense.  Yes, 'suspense', for, like 'Lincoln', the idea that you are caught up in rooting for a side, as if you do not know how it all comes out, is the sign of a well-told tale.

So, why 3 stars?  I'd do 3.5 if available, but here's the real thing:  I would do four if the movie was not already so hyped.  I know a review shouldn't be based on other reviews,  but, when 'Argo' was over, I thought, ""Hmm...that was a decent flick, especially since Carter got to talk at the end.""  And that is not the mark of a movie I run out and tell people to watch.
  Goodman and Arkin dancing around was stupid, the last-second phone ringing trite,  and the ending smelled of a Hollywood massage for the masses.  (""Keep it tense, or we lose them!"")

Of course real stories sometimes limit the development of the story. In a film like Zero Dark Thirty there were two stories. One was non-fiction and the other fiction. So liberties could be taken.

THe editing was disjointed, but the Hollywood scenes and satire on Hollywood was quite funny and fine, Alan Arkin and John Goodman were superb, for the rest of the international scenes, stay home and watch Homeland.
Why it won the best picture is beyond me, other than because it was so self congratulatory on America or because it was among some of the most mediocre films made in 012.",1362614400,,636,4.6875

Clock is ticking! Someone innocent is going to DIE if we don't move and move fast. The enemy: walking around with big scarey looking guns. Then the enemy is running with big scarey looking guns.

4876606,4,B005S9ELM6,Told a story that was unknown and overlooked later that needed to be told. It also brought to light the US policy (suppoert of a corrupt Shah) that justified the Iranian people to do what they did. These were stories never told in the 1980's.,1362614400,,242,4.4

I don't know what is so great about the movie, unless everyone is talking about the fact that it is a true story. The movie itself is boring to me.

I've seen most of them all. Netflix Amazon Vodo Direct etc, not to mention Redbox. So I may see three movies in a day. It helps to know what I like in order to be fair. Movies that come to mind are , Heat, tombstone, Galaxy quest, Transformers, butter, Bag of hammers, Bridesmaids, Hangover, Knuckles, Food inc, What stays in Vegas, Along came Polly. Love Ben stiller, Owen Wilson, Al Pacino, Jack Nichols, Huge Jackman, etc. I like scify I like Disney. I have a wide range of likes. Shrek, Babe, Mars needs Moms etc etc. If its done well and keeps my interest I will rate it a 3. Starts well and ends bad, (like end of watch) I will still give it a 3. Starts well keeps me in the show and ends well I will rate it a 4. If I don't remember it, then I cant recommend it. I waited for this movie due to the publicity it revived during the Oscars.

The dialouge is stellar, the acting is superb, and the direction, also by Ben Affleck was unmatched. He has come a long way in his career, and I feel that he will continue to grow as an actor, and a director of cinema.
The costumes were spot on, and I loved the historic material that was in the film. Every actor, no matter how small of a part did an excellent job with the material.
The best movie of 2012....no doubt!!!

4876833,5,B005S9ELM6,"Great story, incredible cast-Alan Arkin and John Goodman are amazing. Well done and it did not have a load full of special effects.",1362441600,,131,4.739130434782608
4876834,2,B005S9ELM6,"The ""story"" how to get the Americans hiding in the Canadian Embassy out of a very dangerous situation is interesting enough. But no, of course Hollywood has to throw in cheap tricks to keep you on the edge of your seat that was waaaaaay overplayed. Really...the ""fake"" Hollywood men were kept on the edge of a set due to a picture being shot at the SAME time some Iranian A-hole was calling to verify the movie story? Really? Coz ya kinda lost me there. Oh, sure, Hollywood gets to show off it's edgy chops but it pissed me off. And if that wasn't enough...at the exact same moment, a very young child pieces together the shredded docs to reveal the pic of one of the Americans, rushes it to the Head A-Hole in charge, who within a matter of seconds sends a team out to the Canadian Embassy and then to the airport...the Iranian A-Hole guards are now storming thru the airport and tarmac with blood in their eyes and a vengence while our heroes are sitting nervously and the pilot is calmly announcing the flight ready for departure. All that's left is to cut to the marauding horde of Iranian guards chasing the airplane as it's literally taxi-ing  for takeoff...

Oh, wait. That's the very next scene. For all the work they went into to get the details right (the actors look remarkably like the people they're portraying) ya have to go and muck it all up by being Hollywood. Sorry, the ending ruined it.

Props to the story, it is a great story but if this was picture of the year...I'm going back to reading books.",1362441600,,1518,4.453237410071942
4876835,5,B005S9ELM6,Ben Affleck truly does a great job telling this true story of the other Iranian hostages.  You will not regret the time spent watching.,1362441600,,135,4.625
4876836,5,B005S9ELM6,"Ben Affleck's Argo is a smart political drama, an exhilarating espionage thriller and a sharp Hollywood satire, that  not only is a successes at all three, but manages to be among the very best of it's various genres.  Detailing American's first encounter with political Islam, it is also a love letter to the enchantment of the movies and the power that is yielded  the world over by people's fascination and dreams of movie magic.
 Right from the beginning showing the old studio logo for Warner Bros., circa 79-80, the fastidious detail to the period and the extremes that Affleck and his talented cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto went to to achieve an ""authentic"" look to the film are astonishing. The movie was filmed on celluloid, blown up two hundred times as to allow it a natural graininess. Prieto also manages to successfully duplicate camera movements from pictures of the particular time and era.
 Taking place in that moment when cinema of the 1970's, when ""movies mattered"" and where cherished personal statements, and the 1980's, when entering the post Star Wars era of special effects and endless sequels. Argo manages to resemble a lost film from the late Sydney Pollack, a movie from that moment in time that like the classics of the era in which it depicts, manages to successfully cross meaningful moviemaking with thoroughly entertaining amusement. It has been cheekily called the last great movie of the 1970's.
 The strengths in Argo are many, including the way the movie is able to  effectively blend historical fact along with Hollywood fiction, to make an intelligent, electrifying remarkably engaging and funny movie. Working from the crisp and knowledgeable screenplay of Chris Terrio, based in part on a magazine article by Joshua Bearman and on Tony Mendez's autobiographical book ""the Master of Disguise"" Argo chronicles a true life tale that is stranger than fiction, as the clich goes.
 Mendez was a CIA ""exfiltration"" specialist, who  brainstorms an idea that would help free six American diplomats placed in harms way during the Iranian revolution after managing to flee the American embassy before the terrorist takeover. They have found temporary refuge at the Canadian ambassador's home. The CIA's plan  is to send in bicycles for the American's to ride three hundred miles to safety, an operative will be sent in to train them to use said bikes if necessary.
 Mendez has a better bad idea, using a former agent now working in Hollywood he will set up a fake sci-fi movie, called ""Argo""  and smuggle the Americans out of Tehran as members of the crew claiming that they were on a location scouting trip. To pull this off he must set everything up as fractural as possible, which seems to be the whole feel of the movie, both the fictional and real Argo.
 The idea comes to Mendez from watching a Planet of the Apes movie, a true life case of monkey see, no? It's hard to distinguishes the facts from the artistic license because we know that the truth is so often this way. I am reminded that after the events of September 11, 2001 that the government did meet with Hollywood screenwriters to ask
for their input on terrorist scenarios, to possibly avoid further attacks. I don't wish to know the differences between the reality and the movie reality. I am confident that much of the third act is indeed movie formula, it feels as such, but I don't think that anyone is really going to care because it is so cleverly done and amusing in the process.
 Argo is one of the funniest and most droll films this year. It understands the absurdity of it's situation, but never resorts to cheap shots or descends into parody. The two major performances here are those of John Goodman as real life make-up effects artist John Chambers, Mendez's contact in Hollywood. Even better though is the great Alan Arkin, as Lester Siegel, a past his prime movie producer with  an abundance of (bad) attitude and sarcastic remarks to easily steal the show and make off like a bandit with it . His foul mouthed, cantankerous geriatric will remind audiences of his Oscar winning role from Little Miss Sunshine. Although I think he is funnier here and gets one of the year's great lines of comic dialogue, it's the one that involves the film`s title, for those who`ll be curious later.
 The rest of the cast is remarkably fine as well, with numerous strong performances from an abundance of familiar faces including Bryan Cranston, an unbilled Philip Baker Hall, Clea DuVall, Tate Donovan, Rory Cochran, Victor Garber, Michael Parks, Bob Gunton, Richard Kind and a delicious role for Scream Queen Adrienne Barbeau, who was a star in the era which this is set. Affleck is nothing if not a generous director when it comes to his actors.
 Affleck has had an amazing comeback in recent years, now excepted as a first rate filmmaker, among the finest actors turned directors with his name mentioned amongst giants such as Clint Eastwood, Warren Beatty and Robert Redford. Argo offers Affleck the chance to yet again shine as a leading man, his recent roles have been parts of ensembles like excellent the Company Men and his own terrific achievement the Town. Here Affleck is the star and the anchor to this thrilling and suspenseful true life drama. I'm sure many stars could have played the part, but Affleck is a good actor with movie star charisma and once more is allowed to shine in that capacity. Affleck has earned the right to star in his movie, where many actors direct their favorite star, being themselves,
this is Affleck`s first time shining the spotlight on himself.
 Argo is so accomplished that one never really notices that the story is little more than a routine movie thriller. Or that we already know the outcome of the events. The plot unfolds so captivatingly and Affleck's direction is so masterful that the few weaknesses of the picture are never apparent and easily ignorable.
 Aided in no small measure because Argo is a gripping story with a concrete strong human center. For two exhilarating hours it manages to serves up a well spun yarn, At time the tension is breathtaking, exhilarating to a point of apprehension. The history plays in such a way to mirror current events and enlighten those of us too young to recall these events as they happened. It is also a very funny and good natured movie full of deserved uplift and celebration of heroes, both real and invented.

4876879,5,B005S9ELM6,Argo is a really well made and elegantly acted movie. My only critique would be that I wish it more closely matched the historical facts.,1362441600,,137,4.52
4876880,5,B005S9ELM6,All the characters were well played.  The story line hung together throughout the movie.  I especially liked the synopsis that followed the movie.

4876882,4,B005S9ELM6,The movie did justice to the situation as depicted by the media at the time. There were many things that were not known at the time that the movie enlightens us. It is commendable that the true and complete story is brought to light of day. Very entertaining.,1362441600,,259,4.416666666666667

4876886,3,B005S9ELM6,"A good try to make the Carter administration look like they were responsible for the release of the rest of the hostages held by Iran at the end of the movie.  The real truth was that Iran was in fear of Ronald Reagan and and on the day of Reagan's inauguration 1/20/1981, Iran released the hostages and the crisis was over.

By 1980, Carter's popularity had eroded. He survived a primary challenge against Ted Kennedy for the Democratic Party nomination in the 1980 election, but lost the election to Ronald Reagan, the Republican candidate. On January 20, 1981, minutes after Carter's term in office ended, the 52 U.S. captives held at the U.S. embassy in Iran were released, ending the 444-day Iran hostage crisis",1362441600,,716,4.766129032258065
4876887,5,B005S9ELM6,"Do not expect this movie to be a documentary. Although it does use a lot of references to what has happened in the hostage crisis, it is far from reality. A captivating, well directed movie with great acting... Must see...",1362441600,,222,4.575

I could tell that it was filmed in Istanbul because the streets and residences weren't quite the same. The screenplay provided a thrilling ride. Were they going to get out or weren't they? -- a ridiculous question since we already know the answer! All the same, I was on the edge of my seat wondering what could go wrong. I remember the joy and relief we all felt when we left Iranian air space, and the joy the six ""film makers"" demonstrated was so evocative. Tony Mendez was very brave and creative.

4876915,5,B005S9ELM6,"While this movie is based on actual events; a little dramatic license was taken to make this an exciting film.  Ben Afflecks character, (Tony Mendez) was a rising star in the C.I. A.  and has to find a plan to get six hostages out of Tehran.  While hes changing TV channels, his character is talking to his son on the phone. He switches on the same channel his son is watching.  One of the last Planet of the Apes movies was on TV.  It shows Cornelius going to the Forbidden City to find the secret tapes that proved the existence of his parents.

This gave him an outlandish idea.  To pose as  a movie producer of a science fiction epic.  The hostages would pretend to be part of the film crew.

The movie is anchored by the fine performances of John Goodman, Allan Arkin and  Bryan Cranston.  If it wasn't for these veteran actors, the film wouldnt have been as good as it was.  The events were a fantastic plan that actually worked in real life. It took a very long time before this story was declassified by the government.  Its  ironic, because President Carter was criticized and labeled as ineffective.  It was Carter that sanctioned this plan that saved the hostages.

Theres a brief documentary at the end of this film that shows us how the plan was carried out.  There were fake publicity, press releases and art produced especially for this mission.",1362441600,,1360,4.504098360655738

4877058,2,B005S9ELM6,"As soon as my viewing of the movie was over, I went straight into fact-checking mode after some events raised a red flag in my mind.  As a British citizen, I was taken aback by the mention that the British had apparently refused refuge for the American Diplomats.  Of course, upon checking the real events, this was in fact further from the truth--in reality, the British embassy in Iran was actually the first place to host the Americans.  It was decided, because of safety to then move them on to the Canadian ambassador's house and the Swedish embassy.  Ben Affleck admits that he changed this to make the movie more dramatic: ""I struggled with this long and hard, because it casts Britain and New Zealand in a way that is not totally fair. But I was setting up a situation where you needed to get a sense that these six people had nowhere else to go. It does not mean to diminish anyone.""  One of the diplomats, Bob Anders, has said of the British that hosted him and the other five diplomats: ""They put their lives on the line for us. We were all at risk. I hope no one in Britain will be offended by what's said in the film. The British were good to us and we're forever grateful.""

Unfortunately, when giving a movie review, I have a huge problem with pushing historical inaccuracies like this aside and rating it for it's other aspects.  The acting was fantastic, the sense of realism was amazing (apart from the airplane chase, which I found ridiculous) and I think the script (aside from the inaccuracies) was good.  However, two-stars off from the four I would have given if they had not played with history.  Plus, this was better than Lincoln?  I don't think so.",1362355200,19,1675,4.4983498349834985

4877060,5,B005S9ELM6,"This film was brilliant and fully deserving of the best picture. Although my brain new from history what was going to happen, this movie nevertheless taunt and engrossing all the way through. Affleck did a marvelous directing job in this film and it is very unjust that he was not nominated for best director. This film is very tense and exciting in places, but there are a lot of funny scenes that satirize Hollywood.

Although many have criticized this film as presenting all Iranians as evil, that is simply not true. Affleck includes a number of ""nice"" Iranian characters, including:

1. The Iranians waiting for visas in the American Embassy at the beginning of the film.
2. The maid at the house of the Canadian ambassador who does not betray them.
3. The information minister who talks about how most Iranian movie theaters showed pornography before the revolution.
4. The guide during the scene in the bazaar who explains what a ""foreign bride"" film is.

The prologue also helpfully explains why the Iranian people were do angry at the Shah. This does not legitimize the violent storming of an Embassy, whose personnel are protected by international law, and taking the personnel hostage. Although Affleck does take some historical liberties, the essential truths of the horror of the storming and hostage taking and the cruel treatment of the hostages are portrayed accurately. For example, the scene where the Iranians mock-execute some hostages really happened.

The hostage taking in Iran was very popular at the time, but soon after and certainly by now many Iranians are having second thoughts about the conservative, theocratic regime the hostage-taking helped install. The ""Green Movement"" protests after the 2009 Iranian presidential election certainly show this.

I highly recommend this film to everyone.",1362355200,,1823,5.14527027027027

Usually, it takes action sequences, big important monologues, courageous heroes, amazing CGI special effects, stellar performances, etc., to get today's audiences interested in a movie.  But this one attracted lots of positive attention from viewers and critics, despite not having those things.  To Ben Affleck's credit, it's much more difficult to craft an interesting movie when the subject matter is a handful of ordinary people trying to get out of a tight spot.

The best parts of the film for me were the carefully-choreographed crowd scenes that vividly captured the fervor and near-insanity of the Iranian revolution.  I remember those times and they made me anxious.  Affleck's re-creation of the time was as I remember it.

However, for my money, there are four films this year that I would place ahead of Argo.  Films that (IMHO) DID dazzle me:  In order-- Life of Pi, Silver Linings Playbook, Django, and Lincoln.",1362355200,3,1097,5.0

4877111,4,B005S9ELM6,"I really enjoyed it, but it's a simple caper film with period piece clothing and appliances (the number of phones with cords was really disconcerting).  Good acting and directing, but the scope of it is small.  In the end, it is entertainment and not much more.  I was not inspired, moved or need to think about it after I turned it off.  Had it not been given the Academy Award for Best Picture I'd be rooting for it as a smaller picture that should be seen.  It's fun and tense.  Instead, if you're only seeing it because of the award, you should take your expectations down a notch; then you'll get a kick out of it.",1362355200,,619,4.293103448275862

4877114,5,B005S9ELM6,"Argo certainly deserved the accolades (including the Best Picture Oscar) that it received. The prologue was succinct and set up the reason for the anger that erupted in Iran after the Shah's fall. Just enough history to keep those of us who lived through the 444 day siege of our embassy refreshed and not so much to keep the 30 and under crowd from getting bored. Clever scripting , nice use of hsitroical photo overlays to authenticate the semi-fictional action. My only questions - were the last 20 minutes or so of the film enhanced for dramatic effect? Were all the coincidences and near misses a figment of the screenwriter's imagination or were the six escapees and their CIA shephard that lucky? In any case, the final minutes of the film were edge of the seat intense. Definitely worth the rental! I rented this after seeing ""Zero Dark Thirty"" in the theater the night before. Together they made a thematically sizziling and emotionally ripping double bill!",1362355200,,966,4.825301204819277

4877116,1,B005S9ELM6,"The Academy Awards have always been, at best, a high school popularity contest.  What Argo represents with its Hollywood kudos and awards is a precipitous descent to the same in the lower grades.  Many one hour TV serials are far more deftly scripted, scored, filmed, edited, and acted than this sophomoric fiction.

The characters, the primary characters (except the CIA operative), are all sniveling and unsympathetic...(an accurate depiction of State Department personnel, but poor protagonists for a heroic tale). The only tension came in the final scene which, by all accounts, never happened. Hollywood's role with this story was more prominent than the Canadians, which WAS heroic. Why?

Thus, what was the agenda of the makers?",1362355200,3,735,5.310344827586207

I had a hard time separating the cheesy '70s sets from the plot.  Luckily, most of the film took place in  a grim Iran.
Argo did not deserve Best Picture at the Oscars.

It would be unfair to view the film and judge the Iranians as oblivious.  Hollywood is known the world over where stars are born.  Egos would love to be part of that moment of fame.  It is--what made the obvious oversights of the Iranian people believable.  The colorful language I could do without, it did not add to the story-line; just made me cringe.

The acting was amazing and everyone kept their egos in check. Ben Affleck's outstanding direction was apparent in every aspect of the movie. It was not only a great re-telling of one of the most important rescue operations in American history but it finally gave Tony Mendez, the CIA operative who conducted the rescue, the credit he deserved for standing up to bureaucracy in the name of human lives. Ben Affleck deserved Best Director or, at the very least, a nomination but the Academy isn't ready for such greatness. It only took them 5 nominations to finally realize Scorsese deserved an award so Ben should be getting his first directing Oscar sometime in the late 2020s. It's truly hard to believe that Ben wone the Golden Globe and Critic's Choice Award for Best Director yet the Academy failed to even nominate him.

More importantly, it reminds us all of a spectacular, scary and sad event that took place greatly affecting 3 nations and more than 70+ people.  It will hopefully encourage those of us who remember the real event as well as younger generations to seek out the real story and learn about the real people that were involved.  We need to take a moment and remember everyone who suffered as a hostage and those who made the effort to rescue them.  Thanks Ben Affleck for reminding me.  I had forgot but now you've motivated me to dig a little deeper into the 'real story'.",1362355200,,732,4.761904761904762

4877614,5,B005S9ELM6,"I don't want to repeat everything that's already been said by other reviewers, so this will be short.  I love movies that are based on fact and this is one of the best (if not THE best) I've ever seen.  I remember when the Shah was overthrown in Iran and when the American Embassy was taken over.  I remember all the yellow ribbons and the heart-wrenching wait to get the hostages home, which might be part of the reason I enjoyed this movie so much, but I also think it will be very much appreciated by younger viewers.  Ben Affleck and everyone involved with the production of Argo did such an excellent job of re-creating the look and feel of 1979.  I didn't notice a single word or shot that wasn't consistent with the times and, as you will see at the end of the movie, the actors actually looked like the real people they portrayed.  I was amazed by the scenes that brought to life the historical newspaper and TV photos that are burned into the memories of so many Americans. Yes, there were scenes that weren't exactly historically accurate, but they were necessary to convey the fear, tension and apprehension felt by those involved in the grand scheme that was hatched to save the lives of six American diplomats and get them back home to their families.  Stellar performances by Ben Affleck, John Goodman, Alan Arkin, Bryan Cranston and the rest of the cast, the excellent period scenery, the script and the amazing directorial talent made this a movie that will be remembered and loved for many years to come.",1362268800,,1521,4.569852941176471
4877615,4,B005S9ELM6,"I viewed this the night before the Oscars 2013 and I really enjoyed the movie in many respects.  I thought depiction of the story was very well done.  It brought back a lot of memories of those times for me, as I had just joined the Navy and this was a very tense time.  I thought the character development could have been deeper, but overall this was a fine movie indeed.",1362268800,,372,4.211267605633803

4877638,4,B005S9ELM6,This movie was slow to begin with but picked up and intensity after 'the group' went out into the streets for a trial run of being movie makers.  Did it deserve to be best picture? Can't say as I haven't seen the rest of the movies.,1362268800,,232,4.043478260869565

4877640,4,B005S9ELM6,Well here we have Ben Affleck all grown up as director/actor. The movie is good entertainment but flexes the story line against the truth at times. I did find Ben's performance good in the movie but I am not a huge Affleck fan. At times it felt they tried to create suspense rather than letting it happen through the story line. Don't misunderstand me I did thoroughly enjoy the movie and would recommend it. Just go into it knowing it is Ben Affleck acting and directoring along with the primary purpose of entertainment. Definitely a good watch though!,1362268800,,554,4.663265306122449

Isn't it too bad Hollywood no longer brings great movies like this to the screen. Instead it is mostly just junk stuff. There are so many good stories out there to be told - WHY CAN'T WE GET BETTER MOVIES LIKE THIS ONE ???? - ANYMORE -

It was very anticlimactic and the characters were never developed enough to make you even care if they made it home or were taken captive in the airport (of course because it is based on a true story I am very happy they made it home unharmed!). I did not see anything Oscar worthy, or $4.99 rental fee worthy for that matter, in this movie.

I was never political or belong to any organization but they still gave me hard time in air port just because I was young with long & Christian having a different name. I was about to loose my flight and finally they gave me my boarding pass back and I ran to the doors and took the bus heading to the plain for boarding. I was the last passenger sitting in the plain.
I went back to Iran recently to visit my family and friends expecting the same type of problems but that didn't happen and I was treated equally among the others.

4877682,4,B005S9ELM6,"too bad that there wasn't a better actor to play the lead role of Tony Mendez.  And while I read that Mendez doesn't consider himself to be a Mexican-American, in fact he looks very much Mexican-American so perhaps having an Hispanic play the lead would have been more suitable.  But frankly I don't care if they had Denzel Washington play the lead, just have someone who can act and that is not Affleck.  He played it as if he suffered from hemorrhoids.

As for the film, it was gripping and exciting.  I saw it in the theatre and I'm not surprised with the Oscar award, although, I also liked Lincoln.  I strongly recommend the movie especially to those who believe that the U.S. can't do anything correct.",1362268800,,708,4.535433070866142

Maybe Affleck uses Argo to take a shot at Hollywood's pandering to often infantile/juvenile tastes rather than making serious films--like Argo. There are many great comic relief lines, particularly the Hollywood bashing lines from the characters played by Arkin and Goodman.  For example, listen for Goodman's character stating that the intended audience for a SciFi movie will not like it, and then identifying the intended audience.

Affleck did a dynamite job directing this, with perfect nuance and compelling action at every turn. My only gripe -- and I made a mental note of this -- was the foreshadowing of the guy hanging from the construction crane leading to a character later talking about such incidences. This is unrealistic. There would have been other things to complain about and other ways bodies were disposed of or presented before the public. At the very least, in real life someone would say ""and they're hanging bodies outside"".

CIA agent that this film was based on - it would be great if the directors cut of this film had that interview with it or one like it.  It didn't spoil the movie at all it just made it ten times better.  So here's a two thumbs up - I suggest that you have a watch party and invite friends over to see it.  Make sure to include adult that remember the event and have them talk about their ""Flash bulb memories"" of what they were doing when they heard the US embassy had been taken.

CANADA saved those Americans (with minor help from Britain) and the CIA did very little in reality.  The guy that Affleck plays was there only a day and and half, the main character should have been the head of the Canadian Consul as he was the real hero of this affair.

It is Oscar material, kept me suspended, even though I knew the outcome.",1362182400,,367,4.183098591549296
4877909,4,B005S9ELM6,"I must first say without reservation that Argo is a very well crafted, powerful, tension filled political thriller, and certainly one of the best movies of the year. Did it deserve to win the Oscar for best picture? I suppose that depends on a lot of different variables. By today's standards it certainly is a memorable movie, perhaps even an instant classic. But when you start examining it and comparing it to other political thrillers of the past it's still quite good but not as good as some, not not nearly as good as others. Just off the top of my head I can name several that are far more intense, far more nail biting, and far more slick and powerful. The first one that comes to mind is Spielberg's 'Munich' or maybe Oliver Stone's 'JFK'. Two others that are more recent 'Carlos', or 'The Baader Meinhof Complex' are simply much better movies.

All four of those films maybe are not the best comparison, because they have the advantage of lots of tense action, powerful moments of suspense that go above and beyond what Argo can promise to deliver, and of course those films have tons of hair raising violent moments, which Argo has almost none of. But maybe that is one of Argo's best attributes. It's thrilling, exciting, and nail biting without the need for much any violence at all. There is the ever present threat of violence, but except for one short moment the movie literally has no violence at all.

What the film does have is a lot of great actors who know how to act and know their characters well. Ben Affleck has shown here that there is no doubt he has become one outstanding director, and the vibe of the late 70's is caught in time perfectly due to excellent productions values. The script is without question superb, and as much as I love Tarantino as a writer, I believe Argo should have earned the Oscar for the screenplay as well.

If I were to compare Argo to another film that would be it's best similar comparison, it would probably be 'All the Presidents Men'. A slow paced, non violent political thriller, with tense situations, interesting dialogue, great acting and characters, and a good script. All the Presidents Men is the superior movie as far as I am concerned but not by great measure. Political thrillers are  still often very good even today, which is why 'Argo', though it deserves the best picture Oscar this year, and it is an excellent movie, I still found my self wishing it was as monumental as some of the other political thrillers I have seen that really are better. In the end Argo is truly great movie making, it's just lacking something more I was hoping for.",1362182400,,2617,4.573560767590618

These six americans managed to nescape when the Iranians were taking over the American embassy. They were able to find refuge at the home of the Canadian ambassador's home. The Iranians were able to place shredded documents together and discover that they hadn't captured all of the Americans. The lead character played by Ben Afleck comes up with an off the wall plan to film a movie in Iran.
 They are sucessful ib selling this plan to the U. S. government and to Hollywood. They use the time that they gain to secure false documentation and other paperwork that they will need to get out of Iran. They are able to devise a plan to actually escape Iran. A short time ahead of the escape the Carter administration comes up with a plan to use the military to rescue the American citizens. Mendez,played by Afleck decidea to go ahead with escaping. It is a good thing because the military plan was a total failure. The final scenes will scare you to death Be sure to watch this movie,it is outstanding.",1362182400,,1168,4.588516746411483

I knew nothing about this movie before watching it, but I was attracted by the rating and all of the top-notch actors (Bryan Cranston, John Goodman, etc) whom I have enjoyed in other things. This movie was predictable and poorly written. Zero character development; what was provided in the way of rounding out even the main roles was SO ham-handed. I remember being bored and disgusted when Affleck gets one of the hostages to trust him simply by telling him his real name, and that he has a wife and son. Really? We are supposed to believe that this is all it takes to solve that problem? I know time was limited but c'mon. BO-ring! The chase scene at the end is supposed to be epic but by that point I was just glad the movie was ending.

4877934,3,B005S9ELM6,"Lately, most Best Picture winners don't live up to the award and 'Argo' is yet another film to make that list.

I have to begin by saying that I really appreciated all of the detail paid to the storyboard process.  As a top-of-the-line, bona fide, USDA Certified, Grade A STUD storyboard artist myself, it was nice to see that we have the power to pre-visualize productions AND save lives in the process.  That's a what an artist at the pinnacle of his/her profession can do.

It was just disappointing that the Hollywood Hotshots who made this film didn't contact me for the actual boards because I have been involved with some of the greatest ad campaigns and feature films that have graced your VISIO flatscreen and the big screens at the cineplex picture show.  Perhaps you've heard of the Dell kid who always ended the commercials with 'Dude, you're getting a Dell' (prior to his arrest and banishment from the industry after marijuana possession, anyway)?  Maybe you've seen some Cialis commercials where the older couples end up knockin' the boots and end up in separate bathtubs in a exotic location?  'Corky Romano', anybody?  All blockbusters and all pretty much successful due to me.

Let's just say the Producers  (Benjamin Afflent, George Cooney and that squirly sidekick to Schwarzenegger and Thomas Arnold in 'True Lies') dropped the ball by not hiring me.

Anywho, I think the getaway sequence in this film ruined it overall for me.  Even if it is the early 1980's, instead of running through an entire airport, there are communication devices called telephones where one party can contact another party to overt, I don't know, a plane from taking off.  I mean, just call the air traffic control tower and ground Swiss Air from taking off as opposed to running miles and miles, breaking locked doors and ripping through fences to get down to jetway.  I was surprised the Iranians even used cars to chase after the 747 as it began to taxi because they are depicted as such incompetents that you would think they would chase after them on camels.

I liked that Marissa's dad from 'The OC' was in it.  Great, great show and sorely missed to these keen eyes, let me tell you.

Not a bad movie.  Worth watching but too much focus on the bizarre 'plan' to rescue these guys and not enough actual rescue.  Plus, we know how it ends, anyway...so how much 'on the edge of my seat' could I get.",1362182400,2,2400,4.684964200477327

4877977,4,B005S9ELM6,"This enjoyable film hits all the standard plot turns.  It is a ""formula"" film, but when you do the formula right (which ain't easy, or everyone could do it), it usually turns out to be a successful film.  We might think of sweeping epics such as Lawrence of Arabia or The Godfather or Gandhi when we think of Oscar-winning films.  But a number of ordinary studio pictures have won the Oscar, pictures whose scope, style, and ambitions did not shout ""Oscar!"" when they went into production.  I think of Marty or The French Connection or Casablanca.  I can't recall a single a-unit exterior shot in all of Casablanca.  The picture was a potboiler melodrama, a Warner Bros assembly line film made entirely indoors at Burbank with a cast assembled at the last moment, and produced by craftsmen who were working at a pace we now associate with scripted TV production--weeks, not years.  But who would want to argue that Casablanca is a lesser film for any of that?  Not me.  I say Argo is in fine company.",1362182400,,1000,4.604519774011299

Indeed the only reality in this film is there were six American hostages that got out of Iran on a Swiss airline everything else has been totally fabricated right down to Mendez's family life,(his son was actually 17 at the time).  The part Canadians played in actual events is so trivialized that it is insulting.

4877983,5,B005S9ELM6,"Argo, the SciFi movie never really made.  But then it was never intended to be.  After all it was faked by the CIA to try and get six hostages in Iran out of the country.  For those that didn't live it, it was a time fraught with tension and high anxiety.  The eighty plus other hostages weren't so lucky, nor were their families.  Those hostages endured horrible conditions and treatment for over a year before their release.  This movie centers around an agent that came up with the daring plan to get a handful of hostages out.  It would not have even stood a chance if the Canadians had not been so brave that they had taken them into their embassy during the American embassy takeover.

Ben Afleck did a great job in producing, directing, and acting in this movie.  His excellent support cast, locations, camera work, and music make it a memorable drama.  I am glad the story was finally declassified and was made into a movie.  The story alone is well worth seeing, but the production values and the acting make it something you will never forget.  Let us hope we have learned something from that incident and that it never happens again.

The attention to detail was fantastic and the way the movie truly pulls you into the anxiety and strain and terror the hostages must have felt during that time really impacts you emotionally as you watch it. In addition, I really liked the intro, which outlines the events which led up to the hostage situation-- you understand the motivation behind the event and, most importantly, you understand how the US's desire for oil pitched an entire country into an age of oppression & terror. You fully understand why things unfolded the way they did, but you still feel sorry for the individuals who get caught in the cross-fire....on both sides.",1362096000,,888,4.810457516339869

4878074,5,B005S9ELM6,"Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but to all those who love to leave negative reviews because a movie is not completely ""factual"", you're really wasting the fingers you're using, and probably some under-the-breath muttering, as you're typing your review.  Any time you see a movie that says ""based on real events"" doesn't mean it's going to be 100% factual.  Why oh why does anyone EVER expect ANY Hollywood movie to be?  I've said it before, and I'll say it again.  IT'S JUST A MOVIE FOLKS!!!

If you can go into this movie with that in mind, then you just might enjoy it, or at the least, be interested in the content enough to seek out a documentary about the actual Iran hostage crisis the movie's based on to learn the historical facts if you don't already know them.  Then again, there are those out there who can never be pleased and have to pick apart and tear down a movie based on either one scene or every little nit-picking thing they can about it.  All I can say to that is you must not be much of a movie lover if you have to do that in my view.

This movie was TERRIFIC!.  It moved along at a perfect pace with impeccable timing of each scene as the story unfolded, and it was extremely tenacious, tensely dramatic, and very, very well acted and depicted.  The musical score was perfect as well as everything about the '79-80 backdrop (back when I was in my early 20's).  If you hadn't known that this was a 2012 production, you might have thought you were watching a movie made in the late 70's, as the cinematography could not have been more realistic.  I felt like I was there throughout the entire movie.

I was especially impressed with the ""underplayed"" characterization by Ben Affleck (otherwise referred to as ""emotionless"" by another reviewer), which I actually found quite refreshing in all honesty.  I thought the restraint that he probably had to exercise as an actor to portray this CIA operative was exactly what was called for, and that is was, in all likelihood, accurate in keeping with the real-life person he portrayed.  He was neither unemotional nor too emotional; which made his acting nothing less than brilliant to me.

Contrary to what others might say, I didn't think anything was over-the-top in this movie either; not even the scene which negative reviewers are eluding to about the run-way scene.  How else would you expect that scene to play out?  It was completely and totally necessary to the suspense, IMHO, therefore complimenting the scene as it should without dragging on forever.  I thought I would have a heart attack before that plane got off the ground, and I burst into tears when the ""all clear"" finally came.  To pull that off in a movie where the viewer knows what the outcome is going to be speaks volumes to me!

The entire film was perfectly built up, played out, and extremely riveting, thrilling, and suspenseful in the final scenes.  The acting was spot-on at every turn, from all the leads to everyone cast as extras in the crowd of chanting Iranians and droves of supporting actors.  You could really feel the crowd's totally understandable ire (from their perspective at least) from the very beginning until the end, as well as the angst of the hostages being rescued and their reservations about pulling off a terrifying feat necessary to their escape.  The comedic portions, most especially with John Goodman and Alan Arkin of course, are priceless too. And you've GOT to love Bryan Cranston; especially if you know him from ""Breaking Bad"".

I watched the Oscars recently and hadn't seen any of the movies nominated for best film of the year.  This is the first, and I will try to see the others ASAP, but I do believe it will be difficult to top this one; which really leads me to believe that this film truly deserved the Academy Award that Ben Affleck, George Clooney, and Grant Heslov (all as producers of the movie) received for it.  I might add that Affleck has also really come into his own as a director which is clearly evident in this film.  I think it's probably one of the most well-made movies I've seen in a very long time, so I can't recommend it any higher.",1362009600,,4153,4.605978260869565

I have lots of friends from Iran who came before and some after that time and their stories about the times and the country were much different. I know lots of Americans who lived and worked there during the 60s and 70s, and Iran was a great place, with mostly happy people and lots of business and commerce.

Love the voice over at movie's end where former President Carter tells us everything came out alright in the end as ""we"" rescued all the hostages.  The inconvenient truth is that he failed in his boggled operation to rescue the other hostages and only when President Reagan was sworn in did the Iranians release them without any military or covert action.

The bravery of the Canadian Ambassador and his wife put tears in my eyes, as well as  the bravery of the Americans who stood up and were willing to put it all on the line to rescue just a few of these hostages.  Ben Affleck played his role perfectly, as did everyone else.

It is always heartwarming to see that there are still some profiles in courage.  Too often  special heroes in the armed forces are never given their proper due....we need more stories like this to show how people are not willing to leave anyone behind if there is even a slim chance of rescue.",1362009600,,738,4.2214285714285715

4878322,4,B005S9ELM6,"I don't usually go out of my way to see political thrillers. If I catch them on a lazy Sunday afternoon, I'll end up liking most of the ones I watch. ""Argo"" is one of those movies I would have passed up watching had it not been for one catch. The idea of the government using the making of a fake space / fantasy film to free hostages from Iran intrigued me. Once again, I'm very glad I listened to my instincts and took it in.

In 1979, six Americans are put in hiding by the Canadian Embassy when the U.S. Embassy is raided in Iran by militants. Everyone else in the building is taken hostage. The U.S. government decides to take the unconventional advice of CIA operative Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) to get the six diplomats out of the country. He will enter Iran and smuggle them out as a group of filmmakers scouting for shooting locations for a fake science fiction / fantasy film entitled ""Argo.""

Ben Affleck continues to surprise me. He's always done his own thing in Hollywood. He'll do smaller films playing less conventional characters like ""Dazed and Confused,"" ""Mallrats,"" and ""Chasing Amy."" The next thing you know he's taking the lead in blockbusters and popcorn flicks such as ""Armageddon,"" ""Daredevil,"" ""Pearl Harbor,"" and ""The Sum of All Fears."" Affleck's had his share of stinkers and received some unwanted attention in the tabloids as well. What actor hasn't?

One thing Affleck has done is prove he's a versatile talent in Tinseltown and isn't going away any time soon. He won an Oscar for his ""Good Will Hunting"" script and continues to collect awards for ""Argo."" The movie is nominated for an Oscar for ""Best Picture"" and it deserves the honor.

""Argo"" appealed to me in so many ways. I was born in 1972 and was completely caught up in ""Star Wars,"" ""Star Trek,"" and ""Planet of the Apes"" fevers. A movie based in that time period about people making a fake sci-fi movie as a front to save hostages is captivating.

Add to that the fact that award-winning ""Planet of the Apes"" makeup artist John Chambers helped the government get the hostages out of Iran. I remember seeing the news broadcasts about the hostage situation as a boy, but I didn't understand what was going on at the time. The whole event is interesting to learn about.

The audio and video transfer for the Blu-ray version of ""Argo"" will please consumers. The picture is clean with well-balanced color. The 5.1 surround sound mix immerses the viewer in the atmosphere of each scene.

There are quite a few interesting bonus features included. Audio commentary for the feature is provided by director Ben Affleck and writer Chris Terrio. ""Picture in Picture: Eyewitness Account"" contains interviews with the survivors of the Iran hostage crisis, President Jimmy Carter, Tony Mendez, Mark Lijek, Bob Anders, Cora Lijek, Kathy Stafford, Lee Schatz, USMC hostage Al Golacinski, and others involved in the events. Four featurettes entitled ""Rescued from Tehran: We Were There,"" ""Absolute Authenticity,"" ""The CIA and Hollywood Connection,"" and ""Escape from Iran: The Hollywood Option"" are included as well.

""Argo"" is an exciting political thriller which will have you white-knuckled and gripping the edge of your seat. Director Ben Affleck did a great job keeping up the suspense and pacing in the film. Even though you know how it's going to end, you are still nervous for the characters as you watch. That's just good filmmaking in my book.",1361923200,,3424,4.811224489795919

Everyone knows that in the end, they will be safe, but it is such a good movie, that, even though I know what is going to happen, it still makes me nervous and tense.

4878368,2,B005S9ELM6,"It is difficult to understand how this movie could be the ""Walk-away favorite"" of the 2013 Oscars, as I read in an AP story.  My husband and I watched it that same day.  He has a real interest in the story as he was in Military Intelligence at the time and has real knowledge of international affairs at that time.  Little remembered is that in the same year the Iranians took over our embassy in Tehran, a total of NINE such facilities were overrun by ""students"" and occupied, in most cases for only about a week, whereas this case was 444 days of imprisonment for the hostages, but the bad guys STIll hold our Embassy.  He can (and did) list at least a dozen other serious international incidents of that year.  (No secrets divulged here, all of the info he shared was publicized in the US and world press.) Well, back to the movie:

As movies go, it was well made and acted, directed etc.  It might have been a good movie if the facts didn't get in the way.  The Hollywood connection was hitherto unknown to me or my husband, and was interesting.  The movie fails to give appropriate credit to the Canadians for their involvement, and seems to emphasize the part of the American appointees under Carter.  This whole thing, including the special features on the disc, seems to be a project to put an heroic face on Carter and his administration, when in truth this was really another ""Benghazi"" that went a different direction, but still proved to be a smear on the presidential record.  In each situation, the CIF (Commander-in-Chief) was not adequately aware of the situation in advance, nor were adequate preparations made to deal with such an occurrence, for which many forewarnings existed.  This is an effort to whitewash that which should not have ever happened.",1361923200,,1771,4.641025641025641

I'm sure he played the role very stiff and straight intentionally but for me that was distracting and a bit unreal.  The movie did want me to find out more about what happened and make me more interested in the subject.  I know it is a great story but I worry about the timing also on something like this as a movie like Argo can exacerbate an otherwise mild conflict.  Someone is trying to make a conflict with Iran to give the US/UN an excuse to move in and there are good people on both sides of the pond that would otherwise get along.",1361923200,,876,4.209580838323354

However, he is the director of this movie and he did an excellent job of it -- he needs to abandon being an actor and devote his time to directing.

And the fact that it won a best-picture Oscar over Zero Dark Thirty, which was so suspenseful I could barely breath in the last 20 minutes, proves once and for all that Hollywood and its ""Academy"" is nothing but cheap politics.

4878482,5,B005S9ELM6,"I felt Argo was a great movie in that it tells the true story of the difference one man can make in the lives of others.  Stories like this should inspire us, usually not in the grand way of this situation, but in our own small ways, to think beyond ourselves and impact the lives of others.  I was also impressed with the acting, and that such closely resembling actors were chosen to portray the six hostages.  I lived through this whole ordeal while in college and being friends with foreign exchange students from Iran, whose fathers worked in the embassy of the Shah.  While they were on our campus, the Shah was overturned, and their lives were dramatically changed.  It was very eye-opening to see what was happening on the other side at this time.

It was well written, the acting was believable, and the direction was great.  Ben Aflec did a superb job.  What I liked most, was that this was a true story.  This was a story that needed to come out.  Our country needs heroes, And this picture fits the bill.  We owe a debt of gratitude to Canada that can never be repaid.

4878587,3,B005S9ELM6,"Argo was decent up till the end when it deviated from the historical record into repeated Hollywood contrivance.  IMO, travesty is not a strong enough word for Argo winning Best Picture over Zero Dark Thirty and, in particular, Lincoln.",1361836800,2,236,5.051282051282051

Highly recommend the film as it is well cast with big-name players but they don't overshadow one another in this movie.  The fact it is based on a true story is fascinating and for those of you that remember the overthrow of the Shah and the rise of Komeni, recreated footage is chilling and well-done.
Great edge-of-your seat thriller, no sex and very little bad language.  Well Done Ben Affleck!",1361836800,3,606,4.592592592592593
4878592,5,B005S9ELM6,"At this point in time, there's not much to say about this film that hasn't been said yet. It's brilliantly acted, directed, written, shot, etc. Much like Zero Dark Thirty, the audience knows how the film will end, but Affleck manages to keep us on the edge of our seat until the very last shot. Affleck has really become something of a Hollywood icon. After years of being known as that one ""pretty boy"" in horrible romantic comedies or stupid blockbusters, he now has three phenomenal films under his belt. Gone Baby Gone, The Town, and now Argo. I was a little worried when I first heard of this film because I was worried he peaked with The Town, but boy I was wrong. Although it wasn't my favorite film of 2012, I'm more than happy that it took home Best Picture at the Oscars. After a couple years, in my opinion, of ""Oscar bait"" films winning the top prize, here comes a smaller film that manages to provide hope for this country we live in. Recommended for anyone looking for a good story peppered with drama, humor, and tense moments. Sorry, I'm rambling and barely anyone will read this, but to those who do...BRAVO.",1361836800,3,1125,4.492682926829269
4878593,4,B005S9ELM6,"Yes, it was a good movie, but immediately after reading the credits (where it admitted it had been dramatized), I had to get on the internet and read up on the IRANIAN HOSTAGE CRISIS to put it in historical focus re: Carter and Reagan. At least it made me ""do my homework.""  So for that I gave it a ""liked it"" rating.  I was mostly interested in Affleck's character's background that reportedly made him the best ""exfil.""  (ex-filtration versus infiltration specialist), and then about the rest of his character's life afterward.  I was reminded at the end just how different our country is from foreign countries, and so far how lucky and relatively safe we are to live here and not there.",1361836800,2,690,4.631147540983607

Ben Affleck is a topic I could write a lot about.  His career has been very interesting - it is starting to add up to a top tier of the ""A"" list.  He has always been an A list star... but has effectively separated to an elite tier.  For several years I thought of Matt and Ben together of course because of Good Will Hunting as well as other films.  After seeing the subsequent post GWH Oscar path Matt took (Rounders, Talented Mr Ripley, Finding Forrester, Bourne, Syriana) vs Ben (Phantoms, Armageddon, Reindeer Games, Pearl Harbor, Surviving Christmas, Gigli), it fell into the ignorant position that Matt was the brains of the GWH outfit.  Now as I examine Ben's entire list of work, what he has been part of, directed, produced, etc, it is extraordinary and fully recognize that GWH was a totally shared collaboration.

Agro itself, good.  Is it classic, I don't think so right now.  I felt sometimes the period music segues were a bit forced, the dramatic music theme a bit forced.

The movie than ran for about 10 minutes and again went into a buffering mode for 10 minutes!  We turned it off and felt that this was a total failure and clearly a waste of money and TIME!

4878690,2,B005S9ELM6,"I cannot believe this movie won Best Picture. Yes the story is compelling as it is rooted in truth however the acting is completely flat. I don't think Ben changes his facial expression the entire movie. Plus at no point do we really care about any of the characters. Sure, Ben throws in a estranged relationship with his wife and 10yo son that is more like a foot note then anything else. We barely meet the hostages and when they had the chance to show any real emotional scenes they end up being short and contrite.

Pro: Most people watching the movie already know the ending but the film still manages to be suspensful and interesting.  Glad to see this critical point in history being highlighted for a new generation.  If the movie was intriguing to you, check out the book ""Guests of the Ayatollah"".

[...]

Obviously, Affleck is a decent director, but his attention to detail is sorely lacking, and that's one reason why I feel he didn't get a best director nomination.

4878911,2,B005S9ELM6,"I could see Argo being made during the W years. After all, Mendez wrote of his exploits in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Master-of-Disguise/dp/1567407099/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Master of Disguise</a>&nbsp;back in 1999, an officially sanctioned book after the cagey Mendez was honored as one of the 50 Trailblazers of the CIA. But, in this day and age one expects a little bit more than a homage to Mendez as played by an utterly humorless Ben Affleck.

The film had a nice look and feel, and there were some good performances by Goodman and Arkin as Mendez's LA connections, but you don't really get anything beyond an ""exfiltration"" movie here. The cartoonish introduction of the history of Iran and the Islamic revolution was totally unnecessary, but then most of the persons in this film were presented as little more than caricatures, with the overarching story wrapping tightly back on itself in an all too typical Hollywood ending.

We jump from the events of the hostage taking to 69 days later when the CIA has finally been called in to get 6 American ""Houseguests"" out of the Canadian ambassador's residence. Instead of a ""good bad book,"" we have a ""good bad plan,"" which sounded like something the CIA would have concocted back in the 60s when Lansdale was the king of ""psy-ops."" Maybe Mendez studied under Lansdale? Mendez has a couple weeks to make a cover for a movie set in Iran, which the CIA used to pull the 6 Americans, who had escaped from the embassy during the siege, out of the country.

Affleck reflects little remorse in his characters for having enjoyed a pretty good 80+ days as Canadian houseguests, while their 50 compatriots suffered the indignities of being the Ayatollah's houseguests. In fact, they seem to doubt the whole scheme (understandably), relatively content to hang out with Ambassador&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ken-Taylor/dp/B004CFAZQS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ken Taylor</a>&nbsp;and his wife. The only really tense scene is when the Revolutionary Guard questions the Iranian housekeeper at the gate. The scene in the market, where Mendez takes his fake film crew, felt contrived, as did much of the movie for that matter.

Either Mendez had a flair for the dramatic or Affleck couldn't resist jazzing it up a little. Whichever the case, the film felt a day late and a dollar short. There was no real understanding of the situation, no fresh insights. It was like Tony Mendez and the CIA could no longer stand Canada getting all the credit for pulling those 6 Americans out of Tehran, and after 20 years decided to tell the ""real story,"" and Ben Affleck was all too willing to oblige by building a movie around Mendez' memoirs.",1361836800,,2778,5.292517006802721

4878914,3,B005S9ELM6,"Argo is a competent little film that's definitely enjoyable in a fluffy way as a TV movie. The premise is ludicrous but factual so everything that's a stretch is backed by the ""it really happened"" tagline though much of what's in the film probably didn't really happen. It's got a great cast of talented folk most of whom do very little throughout the movie.

The big disappointment here is that it's just not an Oscar-winning, great film. The good performances from Arkin and Goodman are brief and then gone. The main characters have no presence or depth in any way whatsoever, especially Ben Affleck who is almost invisible in the whole file. And there's no effective tension beyond the first act, to the point where <SPOILERS> the final scene is reminiscent of any generic 80s film where bad guys chase the heroes onto a plane </SPOILERS>.

It's a shame since the premise is intriguing. But it starts with a lecturing 2-minute voiceover about how the US/UK screwed over Iran and doesn't really get much of a unique narrative beyond that. It's relatively entertaining but, fundamentally, I'd never watch it again because it has nothing that would make you interested the second time around (compared with great Oscar winners/contenders such as Goodfellas or Schindler's List).",1361750400,2,1278,4.9672897196261685

Generations ago actors were esteemed less than your average peasant. Today however, they are glorified and exalted as demigods to our youth from even the steps of The White House by ""star-struck"" media and politicians who have forgotten the true character of heroes, public service, and Virtue.

We weren't sure if we would like it, not remembering too much about that situation, but much to our surprise as the movie progressed our interest did also.  Once in Iran and with all the orignal TV film clips here and there shown, it refreshed our memories of that time and how terrifying it must of been for all those hostages, but especially for the six that were hiding in the Canadian ambassador's house. The movie kept us on the edge of our seats once they headed for the airport in Iran. We think if you watch this movie you will agree it is very good and will make you proud of what the real people involved in this did way back then and just how they pulled it off.  Just amazing.....

It was a classified mission and it is amazing that events like this do take place to save Americans, only until they are declassified do we know any of the details as we do in Argo. The ending is touching as it tells the updated story of the real six Americans along with the real Tony Mendez. The cooperation between the USA and Canada was not at all a surprise since our two countries live side by side in peace, two of the few that do in this world.

Job well done by everyone involved with the making of this movie, which is why I gave it five stars......",1361750400,2,1335,4.19921875
4878942,5,B005S9ELM6,"With two wildly gripping yet commercially underperforming movies under his belt (Gone Baby Gone and The Town), Ben Affleck finally gets his breakout hit with ""Argo"", a smart and tense thriller that boasts a terrific cast and intensely engaging story.

First of all, the cast here is amazing. Say what you want about Affleck's ""Gigli"" days but the actor continues to prove he has what it takes to pull off a challenging role. Affleck's Mendez is meticulous and intelligent yet comfortable in not being recognized for the true hero that he was. The actor/director surrounds himself with great talent as well, such as the men who helped make his plan possible including Alan Arkin, John Goodman, and Bryan Cranston.

The direction is this film is so good and once and for all proves that, though I enjoy his roles, Affleck is a much better director than actor. The story never waivers or lingers longer than it should and the introductory scene, as well as the white-knuckle finale are some of the most tense moments in recent movie history. The film also contains a lot of comedic moments, mainly as it pokes fun of the movie industry it's portraying. There's a real dark comedy feel to the film and Arkin and Goodman especially have some great lines.

While I can't vouch for the validity of the historical accuracy behind the story, the film presented is engaging, political, and hard to forget. The movie is more than deserving of the plethora of awards it received and the hype it's obtained. Any pundits who claimed Affleck didn't have the chops to make it as a director in Hollywood can finally be silenced. With one of the best movies of the year and the Academy Award for Best Picture in his hand, Mr. Affleck will be able to make any movie he chooses from this point forward, and that is something to look forward to.",1361750400,4,1824,4.67601246105919

After all, there was no Shah as a bone of contention in 2009 or the Ayatollah Khomeini, either.  There was no revolution going on, get real, get a grip.  Go compare apples to it.  The oranges aren't working.  They walked their dim witted behinds on their own over that border and were not representing their country like these 6 and the other hostages.

4878996,4,B005S9ELM6,"Argo is the true account (though plenty of artistic license is taken) of six American embassy workers in Tehran who avoided being taken as hostages in the 1979 Iranian revolution. Instead they managed to escape the embassy as it was being overrun and sought refuge in the Canadian ambassador's private residence.

Not knowing how to safely extract the Americans, the CIA struggles to come up with a plausible plan. Finally, CIA agent Tony Mendez (Affleck) hatches an extraordinary plan: He'll enter Iran disguised as a Canadian filmmaker filming Argo, a cheesy sci-fi screenplay that has been repeatedly shelved by Hollywood studios for years, and have the escaped American embassy workers play his Canadian film crew. When they're done ""filming the movie"" the plan is for all of them to simply fly out of the country.

The rest of the movie is one thrilling moment after another. A trip to the bazaar by the fictitious film crew turns ugly when the hostile Iranian crowd turns on the white Westerners. The final intense scene at the airport sees the Americans suffer one setback after another as they try to board their plane before the Iranians uncover their true identities.

The scene depicting the embassy being overrun on the beginning of the movie was especially chilling because the movie was released just weeks after the Benghazi attack.

Affleck should be given tons of credit for his directing abilities and incredible pacing of the movie. He also deserves kudos for not taking this opportunity to preach a sermon based on his liberal leanings (the opportunity was there) or allowing the fiction of the movie to outweigh the facts.",1361664000,3,1643,4.985401459854015

Some of that is creating subterfuge that is designed to be valid and believable.
New identities that were given to the six in hiding.
On the other hand, it's better not to read an actual account of the escapade via Mendez, since the actual exit from Iran was quite boring, with the Iranians suspecting nothing.
Perhaps Iranians who do not have access to actual accounts will feel better about themselves because of the fictional version.
Mendez was one of the CIA people capable of creating passports and identities out of nothing, allowing them to walk through customs checkpoints with relative ease.
The fact that Affleck played up the Argo F Y was really unnecessary, and perhaps pleased the writers or producers who think this is clever or funny.
I think it would have been a better movie without it - and most of the White House profanity as well.
It could easily have been rated PG-13.
Mendez has written a book about his exploits, with much more detail.

4879049,5,B005S9ELM6,"Argo is a thriller spy movie in which Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) is a CIA agent who develops a plan to rescue six American diplomatic agents that are hiding in the Canadian embassy in Tehran during the Iranian Hostage Crisis. If they are captured they will be killed as spies. The plan is risky and dangerous and getting into the country and back out is very difficult.

Tony is asked to review all of the plans put forth by the CIA and they are simply a joke and he rips them apart. He comes up with a plan that he thinks is brilliant but his bosses think his ideas are crazier than their own plans. With things escalating in Iran and every second counting they agree to go ahead with his plan but there is one caveat. He has to lead and be the front man in the mission and go into Iran.....

This is a very good film and it provides an insight into some of the secret missions that our government and the CIA are involved in. Ben Affleck just shines in this movie and he is truly becoming a great lead actor. He also directed the movie and it is quite an achievement. If you like suspense and dramatic movies then this one is for you.

As you know the movie is based on a true story and it is nice to hear the truth (As Hollywood likes to tell it) about how the six diplomats got out of Iran. In summary this is a good movie with a good cast and I recommend it to you. You should enjoy it as it is an interesting and gripping story.

I do think that the cooperation and bravery of the Canadian government and of the Canadian Embassy was downplayed a lot and they should have been more recognized in the film as real heroes and supporters of America during those tough times.",1361664000,,1675,4.160493827160494

4879081,3,B005S9ELM6,"What do these have in common?

Both generated great gobs of money, both represent a dramatic distortion of the truth, both take another significant chunk out of American credibility.

It is bad enough that a majority of America receives its education (17th or lower in world ranking) from movies, in Argo's case  ""based on a declassified true story"". When Ben claimed, in a recent interview, that the reason the Canadians integral role (90% Canada/ 10% USA - according to president Jimmy Carter and those actually involved) in freeing the hostages was not represented truthfully, he brushed it off quickly by commenting that ""there was not enough time to fit it all in"".

In other words, for Ben, making the Americans ""centre of the universe"" even under the guise of docudrama, trumps truth. The reality is that the small role the CIA did actually play, had the real potential of getting the hostages killed on their way out of Iran. Historically (pun intended) the CIA espionage folk put a wrong date on the passport stamp - which if not detected, and altered (again by a Canadian) would have meant instant detection, and potentially certain death on their way out of the airport - not to mention what would have happened to the Canadian embassy personnel.

Dramatic license must be extended to any historical account for time constraints or the inevitable lapse in research, however, when the focus is to distort and or pervert the truth, everyone involved suffers.

Ben in recent award shows, still attempts to use his youthful ignorance and surprised-face to pass off this travesty of history. I don't buy that, or the movie - nor should anyone interested in the truth. Historical accuracy can be every bit as dramatic and entertaining as BS with the added bonus of attracting a wider audience and staying on the charts for many more years.

No doubt, all those, who have or will receive monetary gain from this schlock will rally to its defense, somehow. There is no defense, however, for the damage inflicted on the historical record, those who buy into that distortion, or the Canadians, and the lives of six US hostages whose lives depended on real intervention by real people.

My only complaints are the introduction's sappy, college-level narration of recent Iranian history, and the final 20 or so minutes in which the movie reverted to stock, Hollywood-style formulas: the seconds counting down, the wild-eyed Middle Eastern stereotypes, and the protagonist's touching family homecoming complete with violin strings.

4879348,4,B005S9ELM6,"With one day remaining before the Oscars, Argo looks set to claim the award for Best Picture. The only reason there is any doubt is Ben Affleck's omission in the Best Director category.

Is the acclaim deserved?

Well, it's certainly a good film. The subject matter and the ultimate resolution will please many viewers. The acting is hard to fault at any point. But despite all those good qualities, Argo leaves me feeling a little underwhelmed. Perhaps it's because my expectations were so high?

The film focuses on the struggle to free six American citizens from Iran, after the US embassy had been stormed in 1979. The six were given refuge inside the Canadian embassy, at great risk to all involved. That's the basis for an engaging story. The reason it falls a bit flat is due to the opening half. We see the hostages escape, but they are not a major part of the story. We are shown a few scenes where one hostage might console another, but there's not enough depth to see them as individuals. We want them to be rescued, because it is the right thing to do, but they could be six random people we happened to pass in a supermarket.

Argo is more about the process involved in mounting a rescue attempt than about the hostages themselves, and that process is fascinating. CIA agent, Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), comes up with the idea of entering Iran posing as filmmakers scouting for a location. His preparation is thorough, and involves creating storyboards, hiring director Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), and John Chambers (John Goodman), who was to be responsible for makeup. The two set up a fake studio and actually go through the motions of filming scenes.

I felt like I was back in 1979 due to the clothing, hairstyles, and generally muted color palette. But, unlike a movie such as Apollo 13 (where the outcome was also known), I was not gripped by the events on the screen for the duration of the film. I appreciate the effort, but I was only truly riveted during the second part of the story and the actual escape attempt itself. There is no need to reveal any more details, because it's better to see events unfold for yourself, even if you know the eventual outcome.

I'm probably making Argo sound like a disappointing failure, and that's not the case at all. I just don't think it is the best film of 2012. It would probably creep into my Top 10, and I'm glad I own it, but I was not fully invested in the plight of the hostages until they were shown trying to escape. It's an important film in terms of subject matter, and I do appreciate the efforts made to free the six American citizens, but I won't be trying to persuade my friends that Argo is an unmissable thriller.",1361577600,,2691,4.549586776859504

4879431,5,B005S9ELM6,"Argo follows Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) as he plans and leads a CIA rescue mission during the 1979 Iran hostage. Argo is an intense, suspenseful, and entertaining thriller.

Argo's story and storytelling are great. I was not familiar with the actual events prior to watching this film, but this film managed to spark an interest on the subject. The story in this film mostly relies on its extremely suspenseful situations; I suppose it's even more suspenseful for those unfamiliar with the real story. Along with the suspense, the film also uses drama, action, and even some comedy in a well-balanced and consistent manner; plenty of memorable characters and dialogue. Argo begins with an intense, unforgettable raid, as you can see the fear and worry in all of the characters preparing for the inevitable. The ending of the film, the last 30 or so minutes, is the definition of ""suspenseful.""; it's a dreadful edge-of-your seat finale. The storytelling is tight and smooth; as in, it's easy to follow and doesn't have much filler content. The performances were great. The music really helped create the atmosphere, tone, and authenticity of the film. Also, the credits of this film has a comparison between the film and actual photographs of the events/people, this segment really showed the attention to detail and the aesthetic authenticity; I really liked this. The pacing was fast, in my opinion, and I was fully immersed throughout the full runtime. Ben Affleck's direction was also superb, like in his other two films.

Overall, Argo is a beatifully crafted, perfectly executed thriller; the film is suspenseful, thrilling, unique and, most importantly, very entertaining. I HIGHLY recommend a purchase, if you already have strong doubts about it because it is a critically-acclaimed film or because it may not be 100% accurate then I recommend a rental.

Argo has some strong violence and blood.",1361577600,3,1902,5.109324758842444

4879435,3,B005S9ELM6,"Of the Oscar nominees I have seen, this one is the most entertaining although its also the least ambitious on account of the fact that its pretty much a suspense-thriller. The film is a highly fictionalized version of a real-life hostage rescue operation that allows Affleck to direct himself playing a hero. Its like a really good television drama like Raid on Entebbe (1976) but with slighly higher production values and an excellent soundtrack (Stones, Van Halen, Led Zep). I think it wants to be Dog Day Afternoon or All the Presidents Men but neither the characters nor any of their individual stories are particularly interesting, the gimmicky operation (a cheesy space epic with an Orientalist twist) is the star of the film. Affleck doesn't act so much as play straight man to zany John Goodman and zanier Alan Arkin (who really provide much of the entertainment value). The film succeeds at capturing the time period (by seamlessly joining historical and pseudo-historical footage of the actual revolution and storming of the embassy), and it succeeds in manufacturing just the right amount of suspense to keep viewers on the edge of their seats without wearing them out with too much political complication. Hence, its the perfect antidote to Lincoln. Its a perfectly competent film about a very outlandish CIA operation but it doesn't try to make any kind of comment on terrorism. Hence, its the perfect antidote to Zero Dark Thirty. Its the perfect film for people tired of politics and of thinking (if the film wins Best Pic on Sunday, its probably because thats the mood of the country right now). But if you want an even better film about terrorism in the Seventies, I'd recommend the award-winning HBO miniseries Carlos (Olivier Assayas, 2010).",1361491200,8,1760,4.989795918367347

There were better performances by his collaborators back home.  While I enjoyed learning the inside story about these 6 people, for the suspense and drama that took place surrounding the real story, this film could have done a better job of conveying that.  It left me kind of lukewarm.  Considering the big haul this film made in terms of awards, I think it was overrated.  When I really enjoy a movie, I can have fun watching it several times.

4879502,3,B005S9ELM6,"This is one of those films that gets a lot of hype but ultimately fails to live up to it. Here are a few reasons why:

- Very little character development in this story. Take the embassy employees, for example. Other than sitting around and looking scared and doubting whether Affleck could pull this thing off, the film does little to let me know anything about them. One scene had a guy voicing regrets about staying there too long and endangering his wife, while another had a guy with his camera turned around backwards in the marketplace. And yeah... that was about it.

- Ben Affleck, while not the worst actor in the world, wore the same wooden expression throughout the movie, said or did very little of substance emotionally, and like the Embassy staff did almost nothing to make me care about him whatsoever. Other than waking up in his suit in the first scene of the film (suggesting he's a workaholic, or worse, an alcoholic), I saw little else that told us anything about his life other than the fact that he's working for the CIA and is separated from his wife and son.

- Alan Arkin, a superb actor, had mediocre lines in the movie and was on camera barely ten minutes, if that. A real pity, that. He tried his best with what he was given, though, but I'm not sure it came off all that well.

- The early scene of the intelligence briefing felt a little too much like The Hunt for Red October, except HFRO had better writing, not to mention better acting from Baldwin. When ""This is the best bad idea we have"" is your greatest line in a scene, you know something is wrong.

- Bryan Cranston, easily the best actor sharing the screen, should have taken Affleck's role in this movie. He's so watchable, and an infinitely better performer than Affleck. Relegating him to such a small role with even smaller writing was truly painful to watch. He managed to act his way out of that corral, though, which is a testament to the man's skills when faced with mediocrity.

- The historical clips, while setting a nice back-drop for the film, did not succeed in reproducing the incessant pain and suffering the country was going through at the time. I lived through the hostage crisis, felt it every night on t.v. and every day in my classroom, and experienced none of that in the film.

- The so-called dramatic tension that had people ""sitting on the edge of the seats"" felt more like paint by numbers suspense. At no time did I feel uneasy or doubt a situation would resolve itself. And even though I didn't know the outcome of these specific individuals historically, I never second-guessed that plane would take off in the end.

- If there was anything in this film that contributed to a feeling of mounting tension it was the recurring scene of the children putting together the shredded paper in the warehouse. That was a nice touch, even if it never really happened... so chalk one up for Hollywood, I guess.

- Oh, and that bit about the housekeeper realizing that the Canadian ambassador's guests were more than they seemed... yeah, that wasn't bad, either.

- And then there's the writing, if you could call it that. ""Argo F*** Yourself""? As a catch phrase? Seriously? I'm just glad that one guy who shook Affleck's hand at the end of the movie did so without saying anything at all. Better to keep your character's mouth shut and be thought a fool than open it and remove all doubt.

- The fact that many of the actors compensated for bad writing by overacting didn't help much, either.

- And now, the good stuff. The direction and cinematography were perhaps the only redeemable qualities of this film... so too bad it wasn't nominated in those categories.  Some wonderful shots of Tehran that made me wish I could get over there and take a look around.

So... to sum up: 3 stars at best.

And is it better than Lincoln?

Hardly.

Django Unchained?

Not by a long shot.

4879515,5,B005S9ELM6,"Often a much hyped critically worshipped film fails to meet such acclaim.  It's easy to see why ARGO has achieved its elevated status and why it probably will win a Best Picture Oscar this Sunday.
ARGO is one of those flag-waving God Bless America movies that has you rooting for the heroes and gets you emotionally involved.  And that's why Ben Affleck's directing snub is so ridiculous because it's Affleck who is responsible for ARGO's effectiveness.  Affleck keeps the movie moving, preventing it from being dry and pompous, allowing the audience to share in the victims' plight.  Affleck guides his talented cast quite efficiently, including himself and avoids useless histrionics and/or celebrity posturing.  While Alan Arkin is always fun to watch, his performance IMO is not Oscar worthy---Bryan Cranston would have been a stronger nominee.  But the entire ensemble is top-notch:  John Goodman, Rory Cochrane, Christopher Denham, Chris Messina, Kyle Chandler, Zelkjo Ivanic, Victor Garber, Clea DuVal et al.
Although chastised for some historical inaccuracies, ARGO's dramatic license heightens the movie's cinematic experience and in no way diminishes the integrity of the real situation.  After all, wasn't that climactic plane chase an exhilarating climax?

4879555,4,B005S9ELM6,"Although it does play a bit loose and fast with some of the facts, ""Argo"" remains an entertaining drama about a real event that occurred in 1980.

SPOILERS:

Set in 1980, five members of the U.S. Embassy are trapped in post-revolution Iran hiding in the Canadian Embassy, the Canadian government and the CIA must figure out a plan to retrieve them safety. A CIA agent (Ben Affleck who also directed) proposes the absurd--he will go in pretending to be a film producer for a science fiction movie and the group will leave the country as part of his film team.

Those bothered by historical inaccuracies in a dramatic film BASED on real events may dislike the fact that 1) the sequence in the bazaar never happened (it does add nicely to the suspense and Affleck admits as such in his commentary track), the entire conclusion in the airport never happened (again, Affleck in the director's commentary admits he was trying to increase the suspense)and that the Canadians aren't recognized enough for their efforts in assisting the Americans to escape (Affleck added a postscript recognizing them but admits in the commentary track that he had to simplify the plotline a bit to make it work within the proscripted time limit for the film).

If you can look at this as a dramatic event based on a real one and accept that it doesn't adhere to history 100%, you will enjoy the film.

END OF SPOILERS:

""Argo"" is, in many respects, a throwback to earlier style thrillers. Affleck chose to eschew the ADD rapid cutting and shakey cam of contemporary thrillers echoing the style of a thriller from the time the film is set in.

The grainy and somewhat harsh look of the film is intentional--Affleck deliberately mimicked the look of late 70's/early 80's thrillers right down to the lighting of the film. Detail is exceptionally good and there aren't any noticeable digital artifacts in the presentation. Colors are rock solid throughout. ""Argo"" receives a sharp, detailed and strong presentation on Blu-ray.

The audio is exceptional as well with an active 5.1 mix although keep in mind that much of the film is dialogue driven.

The special features are quite nice as well with a commentary track from star/director Affleck and writer Chris Terrio that provides us with quite a bit of detail on the shoot as well as some changes that occurred during the scripting vs. shooting of the film.

We also get a picture-in-picture option that allows you to watch interviews with those who lived through the incident discuss as we're watching the action. It's a terrific special feature.

We also get a very good featurette featuring the people who lived through the events portrayed in ""Argo"" including former President Jimmy Carter.

""Absolute Authenticy"" focuses on how detailed the production was at recreating the look of the time.

""Escape from Iran-The Hollywood Option"" is the only special feature presented in standard definition running about 48 minutes. It features plenty of interviews and vintage footage that contrasts nicely with the ficitional account.

Although the film has been criticized for its lack of fidelity to the facts, the fictionalized version of what occurred in 1979 is a terrific thriller that nicely recaptures the feel of the time.

4879557,5,B005S9ELM6,"There is so much hype regarding the Oscars now that viewing any of the contenders is met with confusion. That is unfair to each of the films because it automatically places each in a police lineup for who is going to win. ARGO is a solid film based on a true incident and the significance of that very important mission to free hostages is one equally share with our good friends the Canadians. That is what makes this film important - the courage and fortitude shared in freeing 6 American citizens form a near hopeless situation. But on to the film itself.

In 1979, the American embassy in Iran was invaded by Iranian revolutionaries and several Americans were taken hostage. However, six managed to escape to the official residence of the Canadian Ambassador and the CIA was eventually ordered to get them out of the country. With few options, exfiltration expert Tony Mendez (played by Ben Affleck) devised a daring plan: to create a phony Canadian film project looking to shoot in Iran and smuggle the Americans out as its production crew. With the help of some trusted Hollywood contacts (John Goodman and Alan Arkin, both brilliant in their comedic roles), Mendez created the ruse and proceed to Iran as its associate producer. However, time was running out with the Iranian security forces closing in on the truth while both his charges and the White House had grave doubts about the operation themselves.

The film opens with a brief but well edited history of the fall of the Shah of Iran and the rise of the Khomeini, actual footage that lends a sense of credibility form the start. For the first hour of the film the plans are set into motion - plans that seem absurdly Hollywood but the options are non-existent. Once the actual exfil mission is begun the film become tense and suspenseful and the cast of characters selected to show both the resistance of the home front and the terrifying situation happening to the hostages in the shelter of the home of the Canadian ambassador makes this a finely tuned thriller.

The cast of actors includes, in addition to Affleck, Arkin and Goodman, strong work from Victor Garber who plays the Canadian ambassador, and Bryan Cranston, Tate Donovan, Clea DuVall, Scoot McNairy, Rory Cochrane, Christopher Denham, Kerry Bish&eacute;, Kyle Chandler, and Chris Messina. Though the film was basically shot here in the US (with a bit of footage in Istanbul, Turkey) the action appears authentic. The film was written by Chris Terrio but based on the book ""The Master of Disguise by Antonio J. Mendez and Escape for Tehran by Joshuah Bearman. Affleck directs, produces and stars. ARGO is an important film to see, a slid movie on its own rights, but is it the best film of the year?  Check the competition. Grady Harp, February 13",1361318400,,2778,4.78125
4879558,4,B005S9ELM6,"Biggest problem is Affleck.  He is not a great actor.  It often seems like he is just reading lines.  Some of the other parts should have developed to a greater degree.

Overall good movie. Not as good as the hype",1361318400,,213,4.25
4879559,5,B005S9ELM6,"They say that truth is stranger than fiction, which is difficult to believe, as fiction is meant to be an escape from reality to enter into a new world altogether. For instance, what if I told you that a CIA agent disguised himself as a Hollywood movie producer to rescue a group of Americans from a mob of bloodthirsty Iranian citizens, and succeeded? What if I also said that it was something that actually happened? My guess is that you'd probably slap me in the face and call for the men in white suits. As a matter of fact, President Clinton officially declassified the operation, codenamed ""Argo"", in 1999. Now, ironically, this critical event in American history has been adapted for the screen and directed by, of all people, Ben Affleck.

  Now, take a step back and examine this scenario. Ben Affleck, an actor who has starred in a seemingly endless amount of unbelievably awful films (Gigli, Daredevil, and Surviving Christmas to name a few),is not only starring in a film with serious undertones, but is also directing it at the same time. If you hadn't paid attention to Affleck for the past 5 years, you'd most likely dismiss the entire movie at face value. Fortunately for him (and us), he's actually a pretty competent director, doling out the excellent Gone Baby Gone in 2007, and the decent 2010 film, The Town. The bi-polarity in both of his talents is almost incomprehensible in this day and age, but if he keeps this up, he might actually be taken seriously for once.

  The premise of the film is already hard to believe as it is, but not only does Affleck have to weave enough tension, emotion, horror, and some dry humor to convince to audience, he also has to ask us a troubling question: Can conflicts or crises be fought without weapons and violence? When a film has to add this many ingredients into one pot, the result is usually  a pretentious mess of a film that suffers from the ""too many cooks spoil the broth"" syndrome, yet Affleck somehow manages to balance out these ideas and themes, as well as the pacing, almost to perfection. Nothing seems unnecessary or out of place, the length of the film never comes to mind; everything fits as it should. Not many films accomplish this feat, so it's all the more surprising coming from an actor that was the rear end of every joke in Hollywood.

  So the more important question is: Does this film have any relevance in our current generation? Throughout the decades, the general public has seen an increase of corruption and injustice resulting in unwanted violence, and this film seeks to speak out to those who've had enough and seen enough. More importantly, the film unabashedly states that no matter how desperate or hostile a certain situation is, the pen is always mightier than the sword. You know what they say, truth is stranger than fiction....",1361318400,,2834,4.695564516129032
4879580,4,B005S9ELM6,"Its hard to believe a mission of this complexity in a hostile environment could have been organized and carried out in such a short time, but the movie convinces you it happened.

4879581,1,B005S9ELM6,"This was a most twisted, propagandistic piece of garbage! The truth of the story of the rescue of these six people was suspenseful enough to make a good movie without resorting to cheap Hollywood maneuvers such as the police cars chasing out on the tarmac at the Teheran airport, trying to stop the plane carrying the Americans to safety. (There  were many other cheap, sensationalistic tricks, too, but you get the point -- and the level to which film makers will sink to sell their product.)

4879582,5,B005S9ELM6,"Ben Affleck is masterful as the director of this historic drama and also does quite well playing the lead character, CIA operative, Tony Mendez. While I have always thought Affleck had excellent talent behind the camera, I have new respect for his acting talent after watching this. This is the dramatization of the CIA rescue mission to free six American embassy employees, who had escaped from their embassy during the Iranian Hostage Crisis of 1979; and were given protection in the home of the Canadian ambassador. Unlike the botched rescue mission to free the hostages being held by the Iranians, this one was successful. The cover story Mendez chooses for the rescue involves the Canadian production of a movie set in Iran...with the embassy employees playing the roles of the production team. The name of the bogus movie is ""Argo"", thus the title of the film...and the code name for the operation. Mendez is assisted by a Hollywood makeup artist and producer; both played superbly by John Goodman and Allan Arkin. While based on actual historical events, the story has been embellished for dramatic effect...the Allan Arkin character, for example is totally fictional; the last minute cancellation of the mission by the Carter administration did not take place; and the story of the rise and fall of the Shah of Iran is not accurately told. But in the main, this is an accurate portrayal of the rescue attempt; and a powerful telling by Affleck...my highest recommendation.",1361232000,,1480,5.020325203252033
4879583,4,B005S9ELM6,"Considered by both (American) movie goers and critics as one of the best movies of 2012, it is something of a propaganda piece but then a pretty good/honest one, reminding viewers American grievances against the Islamic regime in Iran over the last generation -- the taking of diplomats as hostages was something simply unheard of in the modern era until Iranian hostage crisis of October 1979- January 1981.

Though remembered largely in the United States as a time of, above all, humiliation, this film focuses on one of the few ""bright spots"" in this terrible episode ... the successful extraction of 7 American diplomats who weren't captured by the Iranian government organized mob that stormed the U.S. embassy but took refuge in the Canadian Ambassador's residence.

How to get the seven out?  Well it wasn't easy.  A cover story had to be concocted.  The story that the CIA settled on was having an agent Tony Mendez (played by Ben Affleck) come to Tehran posing as Canadian film-maker looking to scout locations for a fake science-fiction movie called ""Argo.""  The seven Americans would then be pulled out of Tehran under the guise of belonging to his ""film crew.""  Was it a ""lousy plan?""  Yes, but it was the ""best lousy plan"" that the CIA had and it played on the Iranian regime's desire to portray itself as ""normal,"" that is, eager to accept foreigners, if _not_ Americans, coming to their country ""do business"" even perhaps ""making films.""

Anyway, the film's based a true story and it offers a bright spot in an episode in American history that most of us Americans would probably want to forget.",1361232000,,1610,4.825454545454545
4879584,5,B005S9ELM6,"It's a story so crazy it has to be true: when the American Embassy in Tehran was overtaken in 1979, six Americans managed to escape.  They holed up in the Canadian ambassador's house, while the Canadian government and the CIA thought about how best to get them out.  Enter Tony Mendez, a CIA op who's specialty is extracting people.  Tony has a crazy idea, the ""best bad idea"" of the whole bunch: why not fake a Canadian film crew, scouting locations for a STAR WARS rip-off?

Ben Affleck has so far limited his directing career to intimate projects: GONE BABY GONE and THE TOWN, crime thrillers set in his hometown of Boston.  What made both films so brilliant was how personal they were to the writer/director.  Surprisingly, Affleck manages to bring this personal touch to ARGO: it's still an intimate film, centered around the people who made this grand scheme happen.  And what a cast of characters we have: Affleck's Mendez, a solid performance, if not quite enough to anchor the film.  (As evidenced by the film's second act, where the weight of the film is thrust onto Affleck's shoulders, and the movie flounders for a moment.)  The supporting cast far outshines the star: Alan Arkin as a film producer willing to back the whole thing; John Goodman as a makeup artist with CIA ties; and especially Bryan Cranston, chewing his way through his role as Mendez's superior.  There's also a whole host of cameos, in the great Hollywood tradition: Michael Parks, Bob Gunton, Richard Kind, Adrienne Barbeau, and others make blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearances.

This comes off not as a novelty, but as an act of love.  Because ARGO isn't just a spy story; in a way, it's an affection note to Hollywood history.  Screenwriter Chris Terrio gives us a multi-layered script full of all things movie lovers enjoy: action; humor; heart; allusions; intrigue.  Basically all that's missing is the romance, but that's okay--this film is romantic enough, in the old tradition of great spy films, to suit anyone's needs.  ARGO may not be a masterpiece; perhaps it's not even Affleck's best directorial effort (that's a matter of taste).  But it's one of the best movies of 2012, a year filled with good titles, and it's sure to become a favorite for many film buffs.",1361232000,,2257,4.838541666666667
4879585,4,B005S9ELM6,"I'll admit, when I first saw that the film Argo was ""based on a declassified true story"", my expectations fell slightly.  Even leaving aside films that clearly aren't actually ""true stories"" (sorry, Haunting in Connecticut), Hollywood very rarely produces films that are true to real events.  I was somewhat skeptical that this one would be any different, but I was happily proven wrong.

The historical backdrop for the film is late 1979 and early 1980, during the Iranian Hostage Crisis, and we're immediately immersed in the time period.  Stock footage is used to great effect early on, and ropes you into the film's setting instantly.  Given the `80's were not that long ago, the ability to recreate them may not immediately impress every viewer, but the sheer dedication to recreating the world of a generation ago is amazing.  The paranoia of the Cold War is still clearly felt, and the news reels from the era drip with frustration with at the impotency of the Carter administration.

The story focuses not on the hostages in the embassy, but on a footnote in the history books: six Americans managed to escape to the streets before the embassy was overrun, and took shelter at the Canadian ambassador's house.  The difficulty is extracting them from the country before the Iranian militants discover them.  The plot moves at a brisk clip, never staying in one place too long, as we meet the people responsible for getting them out:  Tony Mendez (played by Ben Affleck) is a CIA agent brought in to consult the State Department on how to deal with the situation.  Despite his skill and experience, he gives little chance of success for the default plans the State Department has come up with, the main one being to simply give the six refugees bikes and pray they make it the 300 miles to the border.

With the help of Jack O'Donnell (Played by Bryan Cranston), Mendez puts together what sounds like an outrageous plan: extract the refugees under the pretense of being a film crew scouting locations for a science-fiction film.  With the help of John Chambers (John Goodman) and Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) to provide the Hollywood credibility, Mendez sets to work getting his ""film"" ready to go.  There's a very appealing tongue-in-cheek portrayal of Hollywood here, depicting most filmmakers as artists either compelled or outright eager to sell-out to the system for a bit more cash.  Given Affleck is a fairly big person in Hollywood, it's hard to tell if he meant for this to be satire, or just a playful elbow at his colleagues, but it's appealing nonetheless.
The actors put in solid, but unmemorable performances, with Goodman and Cranston doing most of the heavy lifting.  The real focus here is on the story itself, which is told with appealing restraint.

Argo is a very believable political thriller, replacing bombs and countdown timers with people who are simply very scared and just want to get home.  Given how complicated the politics were at the time, it's a credit to the film that it doesn't point fingers.  To do otherwise would take away from the fact that this is really just a film about human ingenuity and decency.  I highly recommend it.",1361232000,,3170,4.8351851851851855

4879589,4,B005S9ELM6,"I remember a ranking list from The Onion's AV Club from several months back about which films of 2012 have the best chance to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. One of the main reasons they felt that ARGO was one of the strongest picks (the strongest being LINCOLN, at that time) was that film award voters have a lot of love for a filmmaker who came up through The System. If you recall, Robert Redford's very good directorial debut ORDINARY PEOPLE beat out better films in 1980 (the most memorable being Martin Scorsese's brilliant RAGING BULL) and the same thing happened again in 1990 with Kevin Costner's excellent directorial debut DANCES WITH WOLVES beating out Scorsese once again in his genre-defining GOODFELLAS. And it's beginning to look more and more like Ben Affleck's ARGO is the film to beat this year at the Oscars, despite Affleck himself not being nominated for Best Director, and there being superior films nominated once again (ZERO DARK THIRTY, DJANGO UNCHAINED to name the other nominated films that are superior that I've seen). Don't get me wrong; ARGO is a very good film, but whether or not it's the BEST film of this year is something else entirely.

ARGO is essentially the recently declassified tale of the CIA's project to get six American embassy workers out of Iran during the hostage crisis of 1979. Tony Mendez (Affleck, doing double-duty again as the film's director and star as he did in his previous effort THE TOWN) is one of the best exfiltration people the CIA has, and he's been tasked by his superiors (one of them being the great Bryan Cranston) with coming up with a convincing cover to get himself there and get the six escaped hostages back. With the help of Mendez's friend Jack Chambers (John Goodman), an Oscar-winning Hollywood effects man who's helped him in the past, the enlistment of a cranky old-school producer (a wonderful Alan Arkin) and a lot of smoke and mirrors, they plan to use a low-budget sci-fi script for a film called ""Argo"" to create the proper cover, with Mendez as an executive producer and the escapees as the scouting crew for this film they plan to make in the deserts of Iran. The plan is put in place, but getting these folks out of Iran in the midst of a great deal of anti-American sentiment may prove much more deadly than anyone hoped.

While there is a lot to enjoy about ARGO, there doesn't feel like there's much to remember about any of the characters. Mendez, as portrayed by Affleck, is a man of few flaws (aside from being an absentee father) and is played to be the unassailable hero of the piece, and has all of the typical beats of this character. He plays the calming voice to soothe the anxiety of the hostages; he plays the self-righteous anger when it appears that the mission is falling apart; he plays the wounded warrior when the mission does fall apart; etc. Affleck has shown with films like GONE BABY GONE and THE TOWN that he has great talent behind the camera, but has rarely been particularly compelling in front of it. The script by Chris Terrio shows that this is his first real film. It has beats of fun and solid entertainment, and there's a lot of nice behind-the-scenes tradecraft being shown here, but when all is said and done, there isn't much gravity to the film. The most entertaining the film gets is during the Hollywood sequences, when Arkin as Lester Siegel and Goodman as Chambers take full control of the narrative, and it gives Arkin easily one of the best and most memorable lines of a film all year. If the film had been two hours of this level of examination, it would have been a much more fulfilling experience, but not as typically Hollywood-level exciting or dramatic. The characters of the hostages (played by the likes of Tate Donovan, Clea DuVall, and Rory Cochrane to name a few) are all very one-note; they're either riddled with anxiety or they're angered over the absurdity of the escape plan until everything finally coalesces in the final sequence of the film where they overcome their fears and step up in typical Hollywood fashion.

Speaking of the final sequence, THAT deserves all the accolades it gets because there were very few climactic sequences that were able to build and maintain the tension that Affleck succeeds in creating.

ARGO, despite its release date of late Summer, strangely had the legs to really intrigue Oscar voters, and has been a real surprise dark horse, even though after seeing the film, it seems almost custom-made to be the safe choice for Best Picture. Films like ZERO DARK THIRTY and DJANGO UNCHAINED are too controversial to be good bets for Best Picture. LES MISERABLES just doesn't seem to be good enough; BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD and AMOUR are too obscure, and LIFE OF PI and SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK just don't seem to have the big push. At this point, it really feels like the only two films that are in play for Best Picture are LINCOLN and ARGO. LINCOLN certainly seems like the safer choice, but ARGO is likely to pull the upset.

Again, don't get me wrong; ARGO is a very very good film, but it's just not great.",1361145600,3,5102,4.658157602663707

4880049,5,B005S9ELM6,"I'm old enough to remember the hostage situation - the beginning of the 444 days of captivity of the ""other"" Americans who were unable to get out of the embassy - and how that situation was one of the causative elements that drove Jimmy Carter out of his Presidency, and Ronald Reagan in.

And I, like most people on the planet, had never heard of the six who escaped.  Until now.

I should alert you that while this is a thrilling movie, with tension you can cut like pieces of cake, it is not an action movie.  No car chases.  No precipitous cliffs.  No fisticuffs.  No sex.  Yet it will retain your attention as if all four were present, and much more.

It's a dry production, with little fanfare, little glitz, and little showboating.  But it scores high on tension and focuses its energies on the realities of the situation, letting glances serve as bullets, and angry words serve as explosions.  You WILL be caught up in the tension and emotion by film's end.  And you'll laugh as well, when you least expect it.

Part of the reason for the strengths in this film come from, of course, the actual situation.  One doesn't have to travel very far in time or location to picture a dense Muslim world with ugly Americans walking a tightrope in between our world and theirs.

When a situation like this WAS foreign, in fact, was the 1970s, right before as all of this became everyday language to non political science majors.  To give you an idea, I was in London that very summer, in fact, in Hyde Park's ""Speakers' Corner"", when a group of angry protesters caught my eye.  They were marching within the park, gathering protesters by the minute, and I was fascinated by the situation.

Being the optimistic airhead that I was, I walked over to the protesters to get a closer look.  I couldn't tell what their posters said, and even their flag--held with pride by several men and women--was foreign to me, so I began inspecting.

BY the time I realized friends saw me, I puzzled over why they were so energetically waving at me and calling me over.  When I returned--to their relieved shouts--I began to realize it was my time to learn a little about the growing tension between our cultures.

About this film: Not only is Affleck wonderful when it comes to directing this taut, suspenseful and economic thriller, but he is equally terrific as ""exfiltration expert"" Tony Mendez, the CIA man who came up with the daunting plan to fake a film project that was looking to shoot in Iran.  It was his job to import faked documents and distribute them, making sure to drill the six on the particulars of their new identity in order that not even the smallest mistake would befall them.

Affleck supplies the movie with a steely resolve that typified what Mendez provided: for it was Mendez who was the backbone of the operation...it was his plan, his neck, his name, his character, his planning, that meant life or death to these six individuals.  His was not the only neck on the block, and those roles are also characterized well -- Bryan Cranston as his supervisor, Jack O'Donnell; Alan Arkin as film producer Lester Siegel; John Goodman as Hollywood makeup artist John Chambers; and rising star Scoot McNairy as Joe Stafford, the most vocal and skeptical member of the six Americans being rescued.  All of these roles -- and many others -- are handled skillfully.  They make it an intelligent -- and occasionally darkly funny -- escape movie.

The movie has been nominated for scores of awards: it's up for seven Oscars, and has already won Best Picture (Drama) and Best Director at the Globes; it won Outstanding Cast Performance in  a Motion Picture as the 19th Screen Actors Guild Awards; and Best Film Best Edition, and Best Director at the British Academy Film Awards; and well over a dozen other awards by major film societies across the country.

The movie came about after the information concerning the rescue became declassified, and in 2007 published an article entitled ""How the CIA Used a Fake Sci-Fi Flick To Rescue Americans from Tehran."" for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wired-1-year-auto-renewal/dp/B001U5SPME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wired (1-year auto-renewal)</a>&nbsp;magazine.  (The rescue had, however, served as the plot to a 1981 TV movie.)  Having read the article, Ben Affleck, George Clooney, and Grant Heslov formed a production team and quickly snatched it up, securing distribution rights from Warner Brothers.  Shot for almost $45 million, it took in almost half of that on its opening weekend, and three times that as of the date of this review.",1360627200,,4625,4.880921895006402

Unfortunately, after watching it I found that I was right.  Why do so many Hollywood movies have to preach the actors and producers political views?  What happened to the movies, where actors, directors and producers main object was to entertain the masses, and earn the big bucks they are paid?  Isn't this what Hitler did to Germany's movies before WW2?  Personally, most of the movies I now watch comes from Canada, Europe, South America and Asia, where they rely on better scripts and actors who know their craft, and not make a movie with someone just because they may have a pretty face, or in Hollywood's case, a bearded face. Argo did not meet the standards that they promised in the trailers.

4880079,4,B005S9ELM6,"I enjoyed watching the movie. Good acting, crisp dialogue, and gripping
plot - what else do we need from a movie that supposed to entertain us? Argo
has it all.

The film is based on actual events and tells the story of the 1980 joint
CIA-Canadian secret operation to extract six fugitive American diplomatic
personnel out of revolutionary Iran. Tony Mendez, a CIA operative, sets up a
phony film studio that announces a film project looking to shoot in Iran.
Mendez pretends to be a film producer, he goes to Teheran and struggles to
rescue six American diplomats by posing them as production crew.

While watching the movie, you feel that some scenes are pure fiction. For
example, it's unbelievable that the airport security guy trusts Mendez's
business card and calls his production company to find out if Mendez really
works there. It's a joke. When you suspect someone to be a spy, you do not
trust his business card, do you? How did the Iranian secret service know
that the American diplomats were hiding in the Canadian Ambassador's
residence? Why did they suspect it but never took measures to arrest the
Americans? At least at the airport? Isn't it too suspicious for the
immigration officers when they can't find immigration cards of 6 Canadians
who entered Iran two days ago? How come the immigration cards are missing?
If Iranian secret service knew that 6 American diplomats had escaped, why
didn't they inform their immigration department and airport security about
that? A friend of mine, who is a professional pilot, says that the scenes
of police cars chasing the Boeing 747 down the runway were nuts. It's
impossible for a police car to catch up a Boeing. One more unbelievable
thing is the 'instant update' on the reservation computer screen in the
Tehran airport. How could it happen in 1980?

The answer is that there were no such things. It's pure fiction for
the sake of storytelling and entertainment.

""In reality, the diplomats never appeared to be in imminent danger: the six
never went to a bazaar, Taylor's wife bought three sets of plane tickets from
three different airlines ahead of time, there was no confrontation with
security officials at the departure gate, and there was no runway chase at
the airport... Canadian Ambassador Taylor noted that, ""In reality, Canada was
responsible for the six and the CIA was a junior partner. But I realize this is
a movie and you have to keep the audience on the edge of their seats."" Taylor is
also shown threatening to close the Canadian embassy in the movie; in reality,
this never happened."" (Wikipedia).

There are other historical inaccuracies. Besides, the film suffers from poor
characterization, but it's a modern thriller. The authors have to follow the law of
genre to keep young audience glued to their seats. Though they should not have mixed
two or even three genres in a ""serious movie"" that turned out to be neither real
comedy nor serious drama. It's definitely a thriller since ""a thriller thrills"",
but not an intellectual one since plausibility is sacrificed for the sake of tension
and suspense.

Generally, Argo is a good movie, or at least - entertaining. The story is cooked up,
but it is fun to watch. Does is deserve an Oscar? I do not think so. It's good,
but not great. Though it's much better than Life of Pi and Silver Linings Playbook.",1360540800,,3339,4.808362369337979

4880102,5,B005S9ELM6,"Ben Affleck's latest bit of Oscar bait effectively balls up the tension, drama and political tripwires of the Iranian hostage crisis without feeling overly dense or inapproachable. An impressive, authentic collection of '70s wardrobe and scenery is partially to thank, with bad hair and cigarette smoke billowing about freely, and goes a long ways toward immersing its audience in the era. The abundance of distinct, colorful characters and speedy editing, though, are what I found most appreciable. At times it almost feels like one long montage, with a short attention span and lots of quick cuts, but a nose for pertinent info and several key performances from its cast add enough substance to flesh things out nicely. Although Affleck's grim, game-faced leading character is often subdued to a fault, his Hollywood contacts (Alan Arkin and John Goodman), Washington supervisor (Bryan Cranston) and scared-stiff American refugees make up for those inadequacies with vigor. Alternatingly funny, adventurous, powerful and intense, it's a melting pot of emotion with a hectic, exhilarating third act.",1360540800,,1100,5.476470588235294

It is still a good movie which shows a very historical crisis in US history but to give Affleck any kind of award for best director or any other nomination is a total joke.

4880105,5,B005S9ELM6,"It was bound to happen.  Water on the moon.  Video footage of a live giant squid.  A Ben Affleck movie that didn't make me want to curse Matt Damon for birthing him into the celluloid world.  ""Argo"" is probably the best movie I've seen this year (har, har), and one of those films -- perhaps because it is a period piece that more than the usual marginally gets a lot of the historical and customary details right -- that is much more mature than many films today.  Well, just about any American film today, where the best we can come up with is teenage girls putting arrows into their less Olympian peers for Donald Sutherland's beardedly sadistic amusement.  Or Hobbits . . . #@!@ HObbits.  Getting out for a movie, let alone a Ben Affleck movie, was not something I'd planned, but the two hours or so of ""Argo"" took me to another world, and that alone was worth the trip.  Affleck directs and stars in this ""based on a true story"" drama about a ballsy joint-Canadian and CIA operation to rescue six American hostages after the fall of the U.S. embassy in Tehran in 1979.  Those of us who know the actual story know how it turns out, but it really doesn't matter, as ""Argo"" ramps up the tension better than most fictional stories.  You'll recognize almost none of the actors playing the hostages, but that's tempered with scene-stealing moments from Affleck, Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, and John Goodman.  Although some CGI of a 747 is dodgy, the film's only real weakness is a desire to wield silly Hollywood-esque F-bomb dialogue that is too frequently a distraction, the major exception being one time when it is used rip-snortingly to describe the two old guys on ""The Muppet Show.""  I can't say too much  more about ""Argo"" without revealing the whole enchilada, but suffice it to say, I'm actually hoping Affleck will direct another movie soon.  Heck, he can even be in it.

The action sequences are extremely well handled, with a nicely judged opening to the film, building up to a tense climax as the hostages are successfully extricated, despite the attentions of the Iranian military. However the film's effect is reduced somewhat by sentimental plot-lines (the sequences involving Affleck's family are spurious, to say the least), plus an orientalist perspective that continues to portray all members of Muslim nations as fanatics or religious obsessives. The sequence taking place in the Blue Mosque in Istanbul is a good example of this. Affleck directs well, but perhaps remains a little colorless in the central role. Worth watching, but could have been better.",1360454400,3,884,5.225352112676056
4880121,5,B005S9ELM6,"I loved this movie.  Without giving away too much, I call this a rare jewel of a film because, it is one of the most heart pounding thrillers in years, and contains almost no action.  How did the filmmakers of 'Argo' achieve this?  A good question.  This is a very rare feat indeed.

Credit must go to Ben Affleck of course.  What a Director this fellow is.  He manages to draw the viewer into a situation where the viewer feels the helplessness of the individuals, and pulls them into the question of whether these people will escape, never once offering any suggestion of whether they will.  It isn't easy to craft a film where the viewer is forced to feel sympathy with the subjects of the film in question - Ben Affleck ensures we live every moment with these people.

I said in the subject title of this film this is one of the best thrillers in years.  I say this because, at roughly the halfway mark of this movie, the tension starts, and I felt my heart thumping out of my chest ; this continued for the remainder of the film, through to the movie's staggering climax.  1 hour!  I can't recall a recent thriller that has held such tension at such high levels, for such a large portion of the movie.  Normally your typical film, even your great ones, have the character development, and middle section, and (if they're lucky), a great climax.  'Argo' quickly tells us the story as development, to draw us in, and then rapidly focuses straight on the subjects of the film in question and offers the viewer the question (without any answers) of 'how can they escape?'

The film is also quite funny.  John Goodman and Alan Arkin have some great dialogue and are natural comedians.  Those scenes are always with just the right amount of 'funny' though - not to distract us from the situation the subjects of the film find themselves in.

I haven't seen ""Lincoln"" yet but, it would be a just result if Argo took away the Best Picture Oscar (if 'Lincoln' doesn't).  I say this because the other nominees, while great, are just films that you see made any given year - a good drama here and there.  I think Argo deserves the nod because it achieves something that hasn't been seen in years - a heart pounding thriller that manages this with no action.  Such a rare commodity, and as such, should be awarded the highest of accolades I believe.  I rest my qualification of this latter statement though until I see ""Lincoln"" which, I'm catching this week =).  If you only see one of the Oscar's Best Picture nominees though, make it Argo.  It is a rare thriller - one of the best in years.",1360368000,,2586,4.464818763326226

4880124,5,B005S9ELM6,"I have never seen any of the previous films Ben Affleck made as a director, but if this movie is any indication, then I should. A masterful job telling an incredible story that I (among many other people) never even knew about. It's an incredible story. One that many would assume was Hollywood fiction because it's so crazy. But it's real, and it makes for one heck of a movie.

""Argo"" takes place between 1979/1980, and deals with the Iranian hostage crisis. When the American embassy is stormed, 52 Americans were taken hostage, but six lucky ones were able to escape. They find a safe haven in the home of the canadian ambassador (played by Victor Garber). An amazing scheme is concocted between the CIA and Hollywood to get the six out and back to America. Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) is sent in to get the 6 safely out, posing as a Canadian film crew who were just in town to scout locations for a fake up and coming science fiction movie called 'Argo'. Mendez gets the help from Film Producer Lester (Alan Arkin), and make-up man John Chambers (John Goodman).

I didn't know this story previous to the movie, so I am not going to pretend I know all the history or what they got right or got wrong. Although, one senses that the breathtaking climax with the plane may of been 'Hollywood'. Still, what we have here is a great film. Even if you already knew the story, knew how it ends, it doesn't make the movie any less suspenseful, tense, and entertaining. That's the mark of good writing and direction, both of which is exceptional. As director, Affleck solidly sets up the situation and lets the tension build. You are as tense as they are on the screen. Like I said, I haven't seen Affleck's past directorial efforts, so I can't compare his directing or style here. I just know that he shows immense skill behind the camera, and that I will be interested in seeing where he goes from here.

Cast-wise, this is a good one and there is great work here. Even though this is a real showcase for Affleck as a filmmaker, his cast runs circles around him. Affleck (taller, thinner, and better looking than the real Mendez. Hollywood!) is there to get the proceedings going. Nothing splashy. However, his Hollywood partners, Alan Arkin and John Goodman, steal the show and every scene they are in. I would go see a movie with just those two characters in 70s-80s Hollywood. They are perfectly cast in their roles and Arkin is deserving of his Oscar nomination. Bryan Cranston is very good (and Oscar-worthy in my opinion). The movie has a number of appearances from familiar faces - Adrienne Barbeau, Kyle Chandler, Bob Gunton, Philip Baker Hall, and Tate Donovan as one of the six hostages. This really feels more like an ensemble piece than a Ben Affleck starring vehicle, and everyone here shines.

""Argo"" gets the detail of the era down well too. The clothing, hair, etc. I personally loved the detail of Affleck's sons room. The posters and action figures. It wonderfully cuts in real footage of the crisis as well as vintage news clips. It's a hoot seeing a young Tom Brokaw, Ted Koppell and others.

The movie is just sensational. Normally, I see these big Oscar movies after the fact. I'm glad I saw this one before the show. ""Argo"" is great filmmaking that is deserving of every accolade it gets. Not only is it suspenseful, dramatic and tense, but it is also genuinely funny in places too. It's a movie that is both hailed by critics and general movie going audiences alike and Oscar. Those don't come too often anymore. It's a winner all the way around.",1360368000,,3564,4.59748427672956

Worried their lives will be in danger when the hostage takers find out the launch a rescue effort. The best bad idea they had was to set up a fake movie and fly them out as part of the crew. The movie is fake but the drama and story is real. Sometimes seeing a movie after it's been hyped up you are disappointed.

At the time the Embassy was taken, six Americans managed to escape, unnoticed. They found shelter in the home of the Canadian Ambassador, where they stayed, hidden, for a year. This movie tells the story of how they were rescued. It is a thrilling story and all the more so because it is all true - every wacky silliness along with every harrowing fear.

The only way out is the airport which unfortunately is being guarded by military forces searching for the remaining embassy personnel.

I know that many liberties were taken in the production of this film. These include but not limited to the part that the Canadian officials took, the dramatic airport escape, and the fact that several other embassies took some of the Americans.

4880149,5,B005S9ELM6,"""Argo,"" among the nominees for the 2012 Best Picture Academy Awards, may very well be the best film of 2012, and Ben Affleck may very well be the best director. Unlike other frontrunners, ""Lincoln"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" ""Argo"" is a movie-movie. Like those other two films, it tells a true story, but unlike those other two, disappointing films, ""Argo"" is not a starchy and lumpy docudrama. ""Argo"" is a smoothly running machine.

""Argo"" tells a gripping story in a gripping way, never preaching (""Lincoln""), never getting too caught up in one aspect of the story to distort the narrative line (""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""Lincoln."") ""Argo"" wants to entertain you, and it does. It's a thriller. My palms were sweating as much while watching this movie as while watching an old-fashioned suspense flick by Alfred Hitchcock, even though, like most viewers, I know how the story ends. I found the opening scene of the storming of the US embassy in Tehran so frightening I could hardly watch it. This is all the  more remarkable given that I'd heard a radio interview in which Affleck joked about finding only older actors to perform the part of the ""students"" storming the embassy.

""Argo""'s cast is full of actors I know well, have seen in many other films, and whom I like a lot: Affleck, John Goodman, Alan Arkin, Victor Garber, Bryan Cranston. It's testimony to the film's power that I stopped thinking about these actors and got lost in the characters they were playing.

""Argo"" tells the true story of a CIA plot to release six Americans from Iran during the hostage crisis. The plot: pretend that the six Americans are Canadians there to scout locations for an upcoming Sci-Fi flick.

John Goodman and Alan Arkin are utterly believable, funny, and moving as the Hollywood part of the team. There's a brilliant, throwaway scene in which Alan Arkin and Richard Kind bargain over the price of a movie script. The scene doesn't advance the plot, but the dialogue is perfect and fast. It's just a witty respite in a tense movie about a life-and-death situation. Ben Affleck is perfect as a CIA operative. He keeps his cards very close to his chest.

Farshad Farahat plays an amazingly hairy airport guard. He screams in Farsi. Most audience members, not speaking Farsi, will have no idea what this man is saying - there are no subtitles. Even so, we are terrified. Farahat deserves an award for his brief but pivotal performance as the face and voice of the enemy the entire world now confronts, an enemy driven by incoherent, focused, murderous rage.

""Argo"" has a little bit of heartwarming family drama, a little bit of arcane CIA in-shop detail, a little bit of Hollywood behind-the-scenes banter, a very little bit of nightmarish torture. It never lingers in one type of scene too long; it just glides along, telling its story as economically and movingly as possible.",1359849600,18,2868,4.805273833671399
4880150,5,B005S9ELM6,"Towards the beginning of Ben Affleck's latest film, Argo, make-up artist John Chambers, played by John Goodman, says to CIA specialist Tony Mendez (Affleck), ""Even a Rhesus Monkey can direct a movie."" This type of tongue-in-cheek word play signifies a new, and deserved, confidence from the actor turned auteur. Argo is formulaic at best in terms of Chris Terrio's screenplay, but its Affleck's direction and the performances from his cast that raise Argo above the bar he set with his previous film, The Town.

Argo is set during the Iranian Hostage Crisis, when a group of Iranian militant revolutionaries storm the US embassy in 1979. However, this film actually recounts a previously unknown and confidential story of six Americans who escaped the embassy and were given sanctuary by the Canadian ambassador. These six are in a unique and treacherous situation of being unknown escapees who, if caught, could be made examples of by irate militants without complicating the heavily observed hostage crisis at the US embassy. Their story becomes the focal point of Argo as the White House, State Department, and CIA all spitball ideas on how to rescue these six trapped Americans before they are discovered by the Iranians. Eventually they settle on a long-shot idea from Mendez, which involves posing the escapees as a film crew scouting locations in Iran for a fake movie by the name of Argo. Terrio's screenplay does a great job of building tension in all the right places, but it does so in a sort of Screenwriting-101 kind of way. In other words, it's predictable.

Regardless of predictability, Argo is a deeply involving film. Just because we laugh when we're supposed to laugh, and we cry when we're supposed to cry, it doesn't mean it's a bad film. Instead, Argo is a perfect team effort. At its heart, there is a tremendously powerful and amazing story told in an uncomplicated way, which is just what every good movie needs at its core. Additionally, it is expertly cast with terrific performances from John Goodman, Bryan Cranston, and Alan Arkin who steals scenes as the cantankerous Lester Siegel. Arkin and Goodman head up the fake film studio needed to validate Mendez's plan to disguise the escaped hostages as a film crew. Here, the film adds an enjoyable layer of film-geek enthusiasm. Finally, Affleck outdoes himself as director. Argo has a deliberate and even pace, some historically iconic staging, and camera work that enhances the tone of the film. In fact, Affleck even shows some side-by-side comparisons between historical photos and some shots from his film in the closing credits. His attention to detail brings dimension and realism to the film in a time where real decisions had to be made without the luxury of our modern digital age.

Argo is the first great movie of the fall season and delivers as both a historical snapshot and an edge-of-your-seat thriller. This is a very strong effort that succeeds beyond any Rhesus Monkey's wildest expectations. A-

The intensity starts from the very beginning when the embassy is being invaded and the Americans are rushing to figure out what to do.  It's not always edge of your seat action, but there is plenty.  The angle from the CIA scenes are pretty interesting in that they seem so out of touch about what would work to free the six Americans.  Ben Affleck plays it cool most of the time and truly believes in the zany story of pretending they are a film crew from Canada.  Some of the things that happened on the Iranian side were improbable in my opinion, yet it certainly added to the suspense of having to get the Americans out of there before it was too late.  Victor Garber played the Canadian ambassador full of graciousness.  It was a suitable aspect of the story to have such a calm character in the whole thing.

The ""story"" starts out with the American Embassy being overrun by a mob in 1979. Six diplomats escape and hide in the Canadian Embassy while talking heads in the State Department at Foggy Bottom try to figure a way to extract them. Enter Ben Affleck as Tony Mendez, a CIA agent, who hatches a scheme to go into Iran under the guise of a Canadian crew looking for locations to shoot a sci-fi film. It has to be realistic so he seeks out a costume and make-up designer played by John Goodman with whom Mendez had a real life friendship. They manage to enlist the aid of a Hollywood producer played by Allan Arkin. They also need press, so they throw a party for their movie, Argo. It gets written up in Variety.

Armed with magazine articles, cartoons, phony biographies, business cards and a fake Canadian passport, he spirits his way into Iran and to the Canadian ambassador's residence. We see photos of citizens not true to the revolution being hung from crane equipment and in other modes of terminated wellness conditions. This is to build the suspense along with the one diplomat who doesn't like the idea and he gives the audience the impression of the one who will blow it if anyone does.

Using a VW microbus they scout the streets of Tehran in their roles. They drive their way slowly through a march in the streets and past the screams of citizens who all seem to have had aspirins with ""Cafe Loco"" chasers of the strongest bean. When they get to the airport, all airport staff from customs inspectors to local revolutionary enforcers licensed to kill, seem to be in suspicion lock-down mode, as if they can sniff out any American behind a Canadian passport. The drama heightens here, and the whole airport scene is what is created ""based on true events."" I suspect it is the same when the American government decided to nix the operation which will practically guarantee the capture of her citizens and blow the operation in progress.

One reviewer describes the adverse Canadian reaction to this picture, which places them in a minor role when they had a much more pivotal one.  He describes the Canadian ambassador appearing as nothing more than an innkeeper. Actually it appeared as a very nice Bed n' Breakfast-Lunch-and-Dinner, eh?

The good news was that Affleck's acting seems to have matured. He creates a taut and gripping film thanks to his direction, cast and license that ""it's based on true events."" John Goodman's performance is subtle where Allan Arkin is better at being prickly--""Argo (blank) yourself!"" he says. It became the challenge and password of the film. The beginning of the film provides an essential ""docu-background"" of historical events that led to seizure of the embassy.

4880164,1,B005S9ELM6,"Ben Affleck is one of the worst directors in Hollywood today. Go see anything he makes, and it's guaranteed to be derivative and cliched. The Town is a heist movie. There is absolutely nothing original about it. Affleck ripped off scores of movies to come up with the characters and plot of that film.  Even if you can't remember the names of the films, you can remember the familiar plot elements, even the mood. It's the same with Argo. It's basically your typical ""crash land"" movie. A group of people end up in a hostile land populated by ignorant savages and have to figure out how to escape. The ignorant savages in this film are the Iranians, whom Affleck refuses to give any sort of proper motivations for their actions, history or backstory. He leaves it for self-righteous American audiences to determine these people are subhuman and hate progress. Which is absolutely wrong and indicative of a propaganda film.

It is hard to connect to any of the film's characters and by the end, the film loses all credibility with the chase scene on the airport tarmac that never actually happened. You see, these Iranian savages apparently have a modern airport, but can't figure out how to call the tower and tell a plane to stop. It's hard to believe this film ever got nominated and awarded for many awards. While I have made it apparent that I thought the film was propaganda, it certainly didn't help matters when the First Lady just happened to show up to announce the Best Picture award. Seriously, when does that EVER happen?

Propaganda movies, even for causes I support, are generally an insult to my intelligence. That is exactly what Argo was. Even if I ignored that, the movie was very mediocre. Better movies with this same plot have been ignored or even deemed terrible? Why does this one get so much attention, especially when the story is altered and fictionalized for jingoistic and entertainment reasons?

I enjoyed 'Argo', but some people are talking this flick up as an Oscar winner for best picture. That I cannot see. However, it is definitely a story worth telling as it's a fascinating tale and reminds Americans about the dangers of a country like Iran.

Perhaps the most gripping part of the film is the opening, as the US embassy is about to be taken over by fanatical 'students' and supporters of the Ayatollah Khomeini, who just returned to Iran as a result of the 1979 revolution. Ben Affleck does a great job in chronicling how US embassy staff members went about shredding classified documents, minutes before the embassy compound is taken over by the fanatics. Equally fascinating is the way in which the six US staff members make their escape, as they simply walk out on to the street from an adjoining building, while the crazed Iranians are focusing on attacking the main part of the compound.

When I first heard about 'Argo', I thought the whole operation was much more extensive, involving a whole film crew entering Iran and actually beginning to film a phony movie there. It wasn't quite that complicated. CIA operative Tony Mendez's plan was simply to create the illusion that a movie was going to be made in Hollywood, by taking out an ad in a trade paper and holding a 'table read' of the script, which was covered by the press. Interestingly enough, the producer played by Alan Arkin is a fictional construct; only John Goodman's character, John Chambers, the Hollywood make-up artist, actually existed.

As the Argo story develops, with Mendez flying to Iran posing as a Canadian film producer and establishing contact with the Iranian film board, it all seemed quite plausible. And when Mendez takes the six members to a bazaar in the city, where their cover is almost blown when confronted by an angry crowd, that also seemed quite real. But when we finally arrive at the crucial scene, where the six must get past an Iranian ticket taker at the airport, without any proof that they actually came into the country, I wondered if that happened the way it's depicted in the film. It turns out that in reality, the Canadian ambassador's wife purchased three separate sets of tickets on three different airlines for the six embassy staff members.

Even more historically inaccurate is the suspenseful scene in the film, in which the Carter administration cancels the mission just as Mendez is about to attempt to whisk his charges out of Iran. In reality, the mission was canceled for only thirty minutes and that occurred BEFORE Mendez left the United States.

Finally, perhaps the most suspenseful part of the film, the confrontation with the Revolutionary guards at the departure gate, the call to Hollywood to confirm Mendez's cover and big chase out on the runway--none of that ever happened. Even without prior knowledge of the true history of the events depicted here, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that the chase on the runway was pure Hollywood.

Does Affleck's 'dramatic license', diminish the film's overall impact? Frankly, yes. Too much of what goes on, seems a bit far-fetched. Nonetheless, 'Argo' is still quite entertaining and is worth the price of admission. More credit should have gone to the Canadian ambassador Taylor, in his role in saving the US embassy staff members (the closing credits merely allude to the great co-operation between the US and Canada and say nothing specifically of Taylor's heroics).

Finally, I was most impressed by the casting choices for the six embassy staff members. The ID cards of the actual escapees are shown during the closing credits, juxtaposed with the actors playing them. Take a look at the resemblance between the real and the fictional characters. It's uncanny!",1357084800,19,3811,4.8885448916408665

Based on a true story about a CIA operation during the Iran hostage crisis, the film hits all the right notes. It features edgy camerawork, period detail, and tense moments. The opening voiceover explains the history and sources of anti-American sentiment without downplaying the destructive state of the revolution.

If you are interested in a mostly unknown stint in which a CIA agent posed as a filmmaker, check it out. Prepare to recognize a host of faces. Still, the movie feels a bit pat.

All the cast, main roles, bit roles, and extras do an  excellent job. John Goodman and Alan Arkin do a great job providing most of the comic relief in this film to the tenseness that was existent during the 1979-1981 Iranian Hostage Crisis. Kudos to Bryan Cranston, Bob Gunton, Philip Baker Hall, Ben Affleck, Kyle Chandler, Victor Garber, Clea DuVall, Scoot McNairy, Kerry Bishe, Tate Donovan, Christopher Denham, Rory Cochrane, Zeljko Ivanek, Richard Kind as well as all of the other recognizable faces in this production.  Affleck, Arkin, Goodman, & chandler carry the movie very well along with Garber and the 6 ""House Guest"" actors, not to mention the actors who portray the Canadian Ambassador's Housekeeper & Iranian Students of the revolutionary ""Komiteh"".  There are actual news clips woven into the film.  Many of the characters portrayed are real life people. I was a very young US Airman stationed in Europe during this whole period from 1979-81 and this film brought it all back to me about what was going at the time in Europe and the Middle East. My wing's mission was as a strike fighter unit and we took turns with our sister wing taking deployments to Southern Turkey not far from Syria and Northern Iran during this entire period. I'm not defending the man, but there was really nothing that President Carter could do. This was 4 years after the end of the Vietnam War & our Armed Services were totally unprepared for this type of situation. The one operation, Operation Eagle Claw, they did try (which was referenced in the film as being in the preparation stage by the Delta Force teams) ended in abject failure. I remember a lot of this because Major Richard Bakke was from my home town of Long Beach, California. As a navigator, he was one of the Air Force MC-130 aircrew members to die in April 1980 at the Desert One site near Tehran, .  Ben Affleck and company did a really fine job in this film of portraying the state of the world at this point in time.

  Thanks to the U.S. allowing their deposed leader to seek refuge in America, the Iranian people storm the American embassy on November 4, 1979. The staff is rushing to shred or burn all their confidential files. The majority of the staff are held hostage while a small percentage escape unnoticed. The State Department begins planning a rescue and asks the CIA to consult. It's abundantly clear to the Agency's ""exfiltration"" specialist, Tony Mendez (played by Ben Affleck), that the State Department is in over their heads. With such plans as having the embassy workers ride to the border disguised as teachers on bicycles in winter. It was back in his hotel watching Battle for the Planet of the Apes and talking to the son Ian (played by Aidan Sussman) that Tony (Affleck) has an idea. Disguise the hostages as a film crew and sneak them out right under the enemy's nose. After bringing the idea to his boss, Jack O'Donnell (played by Bryan Cranston) the plan gets the go-ahead. Later, they approach the make-up specialist who worked on The Planet of the Apes who has also done work for the Agency in the past, John Chambers (played by John Goodman). Chambers in turn introduces Mendez to a well-known producer named Lester Siegel (played by Alan Arkin). Once they've chosen a script, Argo, a science-fiction fantasy in the style of Star Wars, they go the extra mile in establishing it as a legitimate enterprise. Where it was simply a poster in the beginning, Siegel organizes a table-reading with known actors, press, and studio staff. While all this is going on, the Iranian government has sweatshop labor assembling the shredded photos so that they can identify anyone who they failed to capture. Also, our six escapees become increasingly fearful that they will be discovered.

  I'm kind of a sucker for movies based on factual events, no matter how much the narrative diverges from history. A Beautiful Mind, The Insider, some that don't have Russell Crowe as the lead actor. That said, it doesn't guarantee I will like it. Case in point, I found J. Edgar unbelievably dissatisfying. Argo, on the other hand, is brilliant, in my opinion. The story is gripping, the comic relief is hilarious, and the suspense has me on the edge of my seat. As a lead actor, Affleck has had some notable flops. Gigli and Surviving Christmas among them.

4880186,5,B005S9ELM6,"Very entertaining, suspenseful movie about how in 1979 the CIA exfiltrated six American diplomats who have escaped the takeover of the American embassy by supporters of the Ayatullah Khomeini and taken refuge in the Canadian embassy, without the knowledge of the Iranian authorities (the historical and political background is shown in an attractive animated segment at the beginning of the film - and is the only part in the movie where the Americans set themselves for criticism for their previous support of the deposed Shah). For that endeavor, the CIA sent an exfiltration expert, Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck, who is very good and who also directed). After conventional escape plans were explored and looked like they wouldn't work out, Mendez thought up a bizarre plan: go to Iran and leave with the six diplomats pretending that they belong to a Canadian film crew planning to film a B type Sci Fi film named Argo in Iran. To give credibility to the story, Mendez had two film producers (played by John Goodman and Alan Arkin) set up an office in Hollywood as if the planned movie was for real. Surprisingly, the ploy worked (since this story is public knowledge, I don't think saying this is much of a spoiler).

Great recreation of an era and a place (Istanbul and Los Angeles are a believable stand-in for Tehran, along with some digital graphics playing the mountains in the background). Interesting and gripping throughout, even if some details were obviously added for dramatic effect (almost certainly the Iranians didn't chase the leaving plane in the runway).

4880187,4,B005S9ELM6,"I agree that Ben Affleck is proving himself as a director to be reckoned with in the years ahead. This isn't as surprising as one might at first think.  Affleck has already won the Oscar as a writer, not as an actor.  The public, however, knows him best as an actor (and as the disastrous romantic counterpart to J-Lo in earlier years).  It is not at all unusual for a writer to move into directing because he already understands how to move a story forward conceptually, visually, thematically and technically.  I personally preferred his earlier film as director, GONE BABY GONE, because he had his brother play the leading man.  I think Casey is the better actor of the two of them.  When they work together they are an unbeatable combination and five stars all the way. If you have not seen that film, see that one first.

So although this movie is very good, I doubt if it is the best one we will see from Affleck. He does an ok job as the leading man, a CIA operative who extricates people from places. The best part of the movie is his crackpot idea to call hostages in Iran part of a film crew from Canada and extract them from Iran on that basis.  In order to do this he has to go to Hollywood, get a producer, a script and so forth.  Alan Arkin and John Goodman help him put it together as his producers.  Those two are the best part of the movie, especially Alan Arkin, who works fiercely to make it a go deal.

There are problems doing the extraction of course and Affleck gets overly get caught up in chase scene gimmicks.  But all in all this film is very good but if it wins the Oscar, as is being noised about, then I can only conclude it is a year weak in feature films.

4880188,4,B005S9ELM6,"Ben Affleck has been a leading man with credibility behind the camera as the Oscar-winning co-writer (with Matt Damon) of Good Will Hunting.  Having shown promise as a director in Gone Baby Gone and then excelling in The Town, he has peaked in his craft with Argo, a thoroughly engaging, real life thriller grounded in historic fact and abetted by a superior screenplay (Chris Terrio from a news article).

On November 4, 1979 in revolutionary Iran, angry students storm the US embassy and take civilian and military hostages, but unknown to the public, six Americans escape to a nearby Canadian's home where they remain stranded with no hope of rescue.  Despite a myriad of standard tactics to spirit them out of Iran, every plan has a serious flaw, and each passing day heightens the probability of the Americans' discovery, capture, and possible execution as spies.  Enter Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), an expert at ex-filtration or the liberating of valuable government assets for the CIA.  His plan is a bold, imaginative conceit: a Hollywood movie crew scouting locations in Iran while sneaking the Americans out as part of the film crew.  Despite the misgivings of highly skeptical State Department and CIA officials led by Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston), the mission is given a `go' with little hope of success.  Compounding things is the fact that the Iranians are painstakingly sifting through the embassy's hastily shredded documents.  With the assistance of an Oscar winning makeup artist, John Chambers (John Goodman), and producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), Mendez creates an elaborate, fake science fiction movie named Argo complete with a script and cast.  Will this movie cover work and can Mendez get the six Americans to freedom in time?  As a true story only recently declassified by the US government, these actual events lead to a breathtaking finish.

The authentic reenactment of the embassy takeover is expertly, vividly intercut seamlessly with real news footage.  Affleck has a keen eye for detail, and he convincingly captures the chaos and paranoia that grips the trapped Americans.  Good use of handheld camerawork adds to the authentic feel of this quasi-documentary narrative.  It's like an episode of TV's Mission Impossible, and, in fact, this could easily have been a made-for-TV movie, but it works better on the big screen where it has maximum impact.  There are more than passing similarities to Wag the Dog and its phony movie ruse.

The Anti-American sentiment and mistrust fosters a claustrophobic atmosphere as the six Americans are under great pressure. The film depicts the real threats and atrocities in the city streets including random executions.  Not knowing who to trust, the Americans bicker amongst themselves with some expressing serious reservations about this unusual rescue premise while others are feeling despondent.  Their fear is not unlike those of pursued Holocaust civilians in World War II.

Mendez, who risks his life to save these strangers, is also a father, and it is that relationship that frames his character in the film emotionally.  Chambers and Siegel (a composite character) are patriots with big egos, and while their comic relief is welcome (including a running gag: an off-color play on the word Argo,) in an otherwise suspense-filled narrative, one wonders what truly motivates them?

The final airport sequence is unbearably tense as it ratchets up the threat, and such a relatively basic situation is executed to great effect.  We know how the story will end yet it affects us in a visceral way.  If the filmmakers take some dramatic license at the end, the film has earned the right to embellish the facts a bit further.  After seeing their story, to see the images of the actors and their real life counterparts in the closing credits adds poignancy and credibility.

One can only hope that Affleck can excel to loftier heights with his next project.  He is already in rarified air, and an Oscar nomination awaits.  In Argo, he has fashioned a nail-biter that never ignores the humanity that binds us together, whether it be father and son, husband and wife, or a rescuer and his newly found friends.",1354665600,2,4182,5.076023391812866

""ACT, GARY!""

This is a solidly constructed and handsomely directed picture, and its attention to detail, even to the extent of a period-correct crackly Warner brothers title card, is consistently wondrous. The seventies `taches and comb-overs are spot on. The cinematography is impressive: the grainy, orangey colours look like real original seventies newsreel footage, and you only realise they can't be when a 747 flies overhead tracked on a static camera which must be a couple of thousand feet in midair. That is very, very sympathetically rendered CGI indeed.

Ben Affleck has his hands full, co-producing and directing as well as taking the lead role: he is Tony Mendez, a CIA field agent who specialises in ""exfiltration"" of vulnerable American nationals from iffy foreign situations. They don't get iffier than the Iran hostage crisis of 1979. In a frenetic dramatisation of the initial storming we see embassy staff dumbfounded that their walls could possibly be breached (""but we're technically on American soil!"") and stunned that the Iranian police wouldn't come to sort the situation out for them.

Ultimately 52 of the American Embassy staff were caught and held hostage for 444 days. What is less well-known is that six others had the bright idea of scarpering out the back door as the students stormed the front, escaping to the questionable sanctuary of a foreign city of 4 million people whom would like nothing better than ""to pour American blood on their cornflakes"".

Having been turned away by the Brits, the Swedes and the Kiwis they wind up as reluctant house guests of the only westerners who'll take them in: the Canadian ambassador and his wife.

Meanwhile, back in Quantico, CIA subsection chief Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston) is put in charge of working out what to do now. His best guy is Mendez. Mendez' idea, even though the best by a long shot, is a total stinker: have the six pretend to be a Canadian film crew scouting for locations for a sci fi movie, in revolutionary Iran. It beat ""cycling 300 mountainous miles to the Turkish border in the middle of winter"", which was the other option.

Early stages are worked as a skilful drama: There is a clever juxtaposition of the Iranian students' trumped up show trial of the American hostages on spying against a public script reading in Hollywood for the titular sci fi film. The preparation for the phoney film is a comedy masterclass from John Goodman and Alan Arkin as a pair of Hollywood old hands brought in to make a credible backstory.

Affleck is the epitome of the no nonsense, unflappable field agent. He also rocks superb facial hair that he really should keep.

Despite the machinations of the State Department, the film caper never quite gets nixed, and Mendez goes in to Tehran. Now the film enters overdrive: the Iranians have twigged that six diplomats are missing and are running down every angle. We fret that the Canadians' domestic help may have twigged too, and spilled beans. It becomes a race against the clock, with a couple of great set pieces, one of which is in Tehran's grand bazaar (deputised for by Istanbul's bazaar, which with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taken-2/dp/B0083UHZK2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taken 2</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Skyfall/dp/B006X040NY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Skyfall</a>&nbsp;has hosted its fair share of blockbusters recently).

Affleck's depiction of the Iranian revolutionaries is sympathetic (that is, more ""Arrec Barwin"" than Spottiswood), it being made clear at the outset that the real villain was the Shah, his presence on American soil being what precipitated the situation in the first place.

There are the odd unnecessary tropes: a daybreak shot of the grand mosque as the Muezzin calls the faithful to prayer makes an uncalled-for appearance, and Affleck can't resist the temptation to over-cheese the ending, but these small faults aside, with a fine ensemble cast ably supported by Goodman and Arkin's comic relief, and assured directing and cinematography, this is well worth its two hours' running time.

Hanged?  Tortured?) is always hovering over everything.  This movie accomplishes that!  It's based on real history, so the story has that extra edge of truth to ground the plot.

Ben Affleck plays a very charismatic yet realistic member of the CIA, an ""Exfil"" specialist, who is trying to exfiltrate 6 Americans who escaped from the doomed American embassy in Iran and are hiding out in the house of a Canadian ambassador.  I really like Affleck's no-BS performance.  (I think that he's maturing as an actor and, like Dicaprio and Tom Cruise, is getting very good at playing more serious and realistic roles these days.)

Affleck's character (Tony Mendez) comes up with a cockamanie idea to gin up a fake movie production based upon a real script (""Argo"", a cheesy sci-fi film), get some publicity for it from his Hollywood co-conspirators, and go over to Iran as a Canadian film producer.  His idea is to hoodwink the totalitarian Iranian government apparatus that 6 Canadian members of his film crew are on-site with him to scout the film, and then they'll just return to Canada by air.  Audacious, crazy, full of weaknesses, but as the dialogue says, ""It's the best Bad Idea that we have.""  Mendez's Hollywood willing co-conspirators (played delightfully by John Goodman and Alan Arkin) are willing to go along 100% with the ruse, to make it seem as though Argo is legit.  That's the fun part of the film.

It's when you are ""in"" Iran that the film really hits home.  It makes you really think that you are there.  The initial scenes of the American embassy getting over-run and the 6 people escaping is gripping.  The scenes of terror in the post-Shah Islamic Republic of Iran effectively convey the chaos, hatred, mob dynamics and fear of a fanatical, America-hating foreign country under Jihadish revolution.  But the movie really kicks into gear when Mendez goes there and actually starts implementing his plan.  The tension kicks up a notch when the 6 escapees realize that they have to do this, kicks up another notch when they start executing their plan, and kicks waaaay up as they are actually trying to get out!  You understand all the time that there is no guarantee of success (and that the odds of escaping are actually against them).

I really like the ride that this movie gives.  Kudos to Affleck for directing it and in his portrayal of a true American hero, Tony Mendez of the CIA!",1354406400,,2819,4.73155737704918
4880201,4,B005S9ELM6,"Ben Affleck is improving as a director while his early and present success will lay down a foundation in future AFI history. Argo doesn't have the makings of  a 'Mission Impossible' or '007', but the intense ""non-action"" works just as well",1353888000,,239,4.829268292682927
4880202,5,B005S9ELM6,"I remember this time period well. I was in college with many Iranian friends. Everyday in the college campus' free speech area, there were tables manned by pro Ayatollah Khomeini and also pro Shah Reza Pahlavi groups.

Interesting and tense times for these students here. For the U.S., there was a hostage crisis on hand.

Such is the backdrop for this movie, Argo. I heard so much about it (all positive) the last couple of months that finally I just had to go and see it for myself.

I came away very impressed with Ben Affleck's work, directing this movie and acting in it, both done brilliantly. Gone are the days when he was good materials for the tabloid fodder and nothing more. I've heard he directed a few other very good flicks, ""Town"" being one of them.

Argo is a highly entertaining movie, suspenseful and kept me on the edge of my seat.

For me, easily the best movie of 2012.",1353888000,,890,4.469135802469136
4880203,4,B005S9ELM6,"Ben Affleck continues to prove himself one of Hollywood'd  best, most intelligent 'mainstream' film-makers. In Argo he manages to combine nail-biting suspense created with a minimum of violence or standard movie action, a sharp, dark sense of humor about the weirdness of both espionage and Hollywood, and makes a film about getting American hostages released from Iran without giving in to jingoism.

Affleck even takes the time at the beginning of the film to put the Iranian revolution into a larger context of prior American involvement and manipulation in Iran's politics, thus making the Iranians' hostage taking horribly wrong, but also somewhat human and understandable.

The story itself is a doozey, and definitely fits into the `you'd never believe it if it weren't true' mold.  Using a fake movie as a cover-up for a long- shot rescue operation sounds like a bad episode of `Mission Impossible' (or even `Get Smart').  But here it is, a part of history.

I have only two small complaints about the film.  First, other than Alan Arkin's and John Goodman's deliciously funny performances as the Hollywood end of the deal, not many of the other characters are given as much texture as they might, especially considering how strong the cast is.  Perhaps the fear was slowing down the film with character details, but I would have gladly watched a few minutes more to know these people better on a human level.

More problematically there are a number of key moments where the suspense is trumped up needlessly by throwing in some very ""Hollywood"" conceits (coincidences, physical impossibilities, the real story of the climax being abandoned in favor of more overt dramatics,  etc) in a film that didn't need them, a film where the whole point is how real world spy operations are miles from what we usually see in films.

Neither of these flaws seriously damage a very, very good film, but I couldn't help some minor disappointment when I felt the film go for the `movie moment' over truth.  But this is still a highly entertaining and intelligent thriller, and that's to be applauded.",1353715200,141,2094,4.951428571428571
4880204,4,B005S9ELM6,"Hats off to Ben Affleck for directing and starring in one of the most nail biting, suspenseful, heartwarming movies of the year. In 1979 52 U.S. citizens were captured in the American Embassy in Tehran and held captive for 14 months. Thirty three years later, Ben Affleck directs an exciting suspenseful thrilling movie titled ARGO,focusing on the escape of 6 embassy personnel that fled out the back door of the Embassy Building before Iranians who were pretending to be students over took the Embassy.

Ben Affleck who plays the part of CIA agent,Tony Mendez, has been called in by the top dogs of CIA to figure out a plan how to get the 6 out of Iran safely without jeopardizing his life and the life's of the 6 embassy personnel. While CIA attempts to come up with a plan, the 6 embassy personnel find refuge in the home of the Canadian Ambassador, where they stay safe until help arrives. Tony Mendez come up with a plan to produce a movie in the Middle East called ARGO by flying there himself, bringing false identities to the 6 embassy personnel, claiming they are part of a casting crew for a science fiction movie. When CIA Mendez gets to the Ambassador's house, he asks the 6 to put their trust in him, but they are terrified, fearing for their lives knowing if they were caught escaping they would be killed. After much encouragement on Mendez part, the 6 agree to put their fate in the hands of of the CIA agent. As the 6 quickly, with no time to waste, learn to memorize there new identities, past present and future, the Iranians are realizing that there may be 6 more embassy personnel out there besides the 52 that they knew of. Time is running out and Mendez has to work fast. The day before Mendez is to pick up the 6 and bring them to the airport returning them safely to U.S., CIA officials pull the plug, telling him to get out, that they can't back up the pretend movie idea anymore. Mendez takes it upon himself to show his heroic side and continue to go through with his plan. As he picks up the 6 form the Canadian Ambassadors home, he fled with them to the airport hoping they can get past all the security.

The scenes in the movie were very realistic, a 70's look. Hair styles, big rimmed eye glasses, older cars, even a scene of Ted Koppel as a young reporter bringing us first hand news through a console television. The airport scene is thrilling, exciting, had me at the edge of my seat truly not knowing how this would all work out. Would all 7 of them make it? Would some make it and not the rest? Very exciting and thrilling, a must see! I won't tell you the end,...""AR----GO"" see it yourself!!",1353628800,3,2630,4.420618556701031
4880205,5,B005S9ELM6,"""Argo"" is what happens when real life is more bizarre than any movie plot -- which is why it makes for such a good film.  The death of our American ambassador in Libya is a reminder that the geopolitical instability of yesteryear is still an ever-present threat today.

Ben Affleck succinctly sums up the state of affairs in Iran: the United States backed a brutal Shah who seeks asylum in the U.S. amidst a revolution and the rise of the Ayatollah Khomeini.  The U.S. embassy is subsequently overrun by an angry mob, and we experience every nail-biting moment as the crowd smashes through the American embassy's defenses and takes everyone hostage. Everyone, that is, except for six terrified employees who decide to make a run for it.  Part of the thrill of ""Argo"" is determining whether or not the six refugees were better off as a result.

The subsequent daring escape plan that ensues is nothing less than a full propaganda assault.  Communication professionals know how this works and it's clear Affleck does too -- the CIA isn't just creating the illusion of a film crew, it's projecting the cynicism of a decaying Hollywood (so aptly on display in the wrecked iconic sign) that lures secret police and foreign ministers with the possibility of money and fame.

And so the plot unfolds: a fake director, a fake producer, a fake film crew, and very real stakes. Part of the film within a film's reveal is the appeal of its plot: ""Argo"" is not just a space opera ripping off ""Star Wars,"" it's about the will of the people rising up against a brutal dictator to preserve their way of life. The secret of Hollywood is that every lie is grounded in a basic truth, and it's upon that tiny truth that balances the lives of six refugees and one CIA agent.

Ironically, that plot was actually drawn from another film entirely that never made it into ""Argo.'"" Titled ""Lords of Light,"" it was a screenplay by Barry Ira Geller based on sci-fi author Roger Zelazny's award-winning novel of the same name.  But Geller had even bigger plans, enlisting famous comic book artist Jack Kirby to create plans for a sci-fi theme park called Science Fiction Land.

In short, even fiction is stranger than fiction. Although ""Argo"" certainly dramatizes the events, it's a compelling and entertaining reminder that the world is a complicated place.",1353196800,,2330,4.759305210918114

Ben Affleck is a genius. This movie had us on the edge of our seats, literally grabbing each other during the many tense scenes. I loved the comic relief in the scenes with the great John Goodman and Alan Arkin too. Everyone's performance was stellar.

Be sure to watch to the very end to see the pictures of the real people portrayed in this excellent movie. Kudos to Ben Affleck on his performance and directing!",1353110400,,589,4.241071428571429
4880207,5,B005S9ELM6,"Every story needs a good storyteller, especially when it is a true story. For sometimes a true story can be so incredible. A thriller ""Argo,"" based on true events recorded in recently declassified CIA documents, is one such example. And Hollywood chose a right person to direct it: Ben Affleck, who, after ""The Town"" and ""Gone Baby Gone,"" once again shows his talent as an accomplished film director.

On January 25, 1980, a CIA ""extractor"" Tony Mendez traveled to Iran, where about two month before a group of young Islamists invaded the US embassy in Tehran. During the confusion six embassy workers managed to escape the building without being seen by the revolutionary guards, and they took refuge in the private house of Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor, who was well aware of the great risk he was running.

Tony Mendez's mission was unique, something that was never done before. Mendez poses as a Canadian producer scouting exotic location for a Hollywood sci-fi film ""Argo"" - a film project that does not exist. And he disguises the trapped American embassy workers as Canadian film crew members so that they can get out of Iran safely. This is his ""best bad idea"" - but will that ""bad idea"" really work?

Set in the middle of the Iranian Revolution (of which background is briefly shown in the opening), ""Argo"" is a tense and fast-paced thriller that never lets up. With top-notch acting from the cast and vivid details that convey the social climate of the period, ""Argo"" is an engrossing experience throughout. Believe me or not, the film is also funny at times.

Like most films ""based on true events,"" ""Argo"" sometimes seems taking liberties with the facts, especially in its second half. Still, with its interesting storyline and suspenseful moments, ""Argo"" is a first-rate thriller.",1353110400,,1795,4.914191419141914
4880208,5,B005S9ELM6,"This is a dramatization of a true story.  That's one of the reasons I loved it.  Another is because of fine acting and high tension throughout.

In 1980 Iran was exploding.  I remember that era well.  At the time some American diplomats were trapped there.  How they eventually got out with the help of the Canadian embassy is a thrilling story and this film tells it well with just the right amount of intrigue and excitement.

Ben Afflick stars in the film as one of the diplomats. He also directed it.  It is a masterful job.

I don't go to the movies much but this film is worth seeing.",1353024000,2,590,4.339449541284404
4880209,5,B005S9ELM6,thank you everyone involved in the making of this film. I  wish I could shake your hand and thank each of you personally. Thank you also President Carter and our Canadian friends.,1352592000,,179,4.59375
4880210,5,B005S9ELM6,"Six years ago, I never would've imagined I would utter ""I'm really looking forward to the new Ben Affleck film"". But after directing ""Gone Baby Gone"" and ""The Town"", I found myself uttering those very words after watching the trailer for ""Argo"", his newest film. Each of these films demonstrates his skill and craftsmanship in creating films that are emotional and intensely watchable. The side benefit is that he has also acted in two of these films, turning in some of his best work as an actor as well. It almost seems as thought each is making the other side of his talents better.

In 1979, just as the Iranian protesters storm the gates at the American Embassy, six American workers manage to escape and they find refuge at the Canadian Ambassador's residence. The CIA quickly learns of the escape and tries to come up with a plan to get them out of the hostile country. Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston) calls in Tony Mendez (Affleck) to help them out and throw some ideas around. Tony stares at the group incredulously as someone suggests they send in bikes and maps, another suggests they pose as child aid workers and shows a picture of a starving child in Africa. Tony comes up with the idea to have them pose as a Canadian film crew scouting sights for a new sci-fi film. He gets the greenlight to go ahead and contacts John Chambers (John Goodman), a make-up artist who has helped the CIA in the past. He takes Tony to Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), a producer who is trying to stay relevant in a younger Hollywood. The fake movie they will make is called ""Argo"".

Based on a true story, ""Argo"" is a nifty piece of filmmaking. If someone had just come up with this idea, you probably wouldn't last ten minutes in the film because the story would seem too implausible. But because it is 'based on a true story', your interest is heightened and the incredulity of the events carries you along. This only works to a certain extent. The film has to be well-made in order for it to work for two hours. And ""Argo"" is very well-made.

Affleck has accomplished a fairly remarkable feat as an actor. Considered a joke for a while, and appearing in one bomb after the other, he started to do really good work in really good films. ""Hollywoodland"" heralded the beginning of a renaissance of sorts for the actor. A few years later, he directed his first film ""Gone Baby Gone"".  It seems like he turned on a switch and suddenly became a good actor and a good director in one fell swoop. I think his ability to use his talents as a director also helped him to mature as an actor. He is now doing some of his best work as both. Sure, he still seems drawn to the big-budget Hollywood blockbuster, iffy projects that could just as easily be bad, but these seem to be the exception to the norm.

In ""Argo"", Affleck's major accomplishment is that he shows restraint. The story is so far out of left field, it naturally captures your attention and Affleck tells it in a straight forward way, eschewing weird and unusual camera angles of filmmaking tricks, both of which might hamper a less-talented filmmaker's efforts. As the film draws to its suspenseful climax, he doesn't need to add any cinematic flourishes because we are already on the edge of our seats.

He has assembled a fine collection of actors to bring the story to life. John Goodman and Alan Arkin are the standouts as two grizzled Hollywood veterans who wholeheartedly agree to help and make the fake film. Their characters also serve as comic relief, offering many memorable zingers about Hollywood and the people who make films for a living. They also help to keep us clued in to how ludicrous the plan is. If it works, it will be a miracle.

Bryan Cranston is good as O'Donnell, the CIA official who brings Tony into the fold. If Goodman and Arkin are the comic relief, Cranston is around to provide the gravitas. When the plan experiences hiccups, he stares at the camera with a pained expression. This may sound like a rudimentary, even unnecessary addition to the film. But Cranston's performance does two things; it provides a nice counterpoint to Goodman and Arkin and helps us stay focused on the seriousness of the situation.

Tate Donavan, Clea Duvall and Victor Garber play some of the people, Americans and Canadians, stuck in Iran. It is interesting to watch their characters as they deal with the always present threat of danger. Throughout the film, the narrative shifts back to them to give us a sort of update, showing us how they are dealing with the isolation of their situation. These moments also help us get to know them, which is particularly important in the final moments, as we find ourselves rooting for them, hoping they will escape to safety.

Affleck's performance as Tony Gomez, the brains behind the plan to rescue these six individuals, is understated. He plays the character without a lot of emotion and there are a lot of shots of Affleck listening to and watching other things happen. This makes him our conduit to the story. And this concept works really well.

Normally, we might see one of the six workers as our guide into this story, allowing us to feel what the prisoners are feeling, making us feel their pain, their imprisonment, feel everything they are experiencing. It might seem odd for Affleck's character to serve this purpose, but because he does, it seems to intensify the feelings the individual characters are experiencing. We spend some time with them, watching them deal with everything. But when Gomez arrives, there is a marked change. They feel some hope and because of this, the stakes have also gone up exponentially. This also explains why Gomez is rather stoic throughout. If he shows any emotion, the six people he is trying to save will instantly pick up on this and amplify it ten-fold causing all sorts of problems.

Both Affleck the actor and Affleck the director recognize the best way to tell this incredibly gripping story is to let it unfold naturally. This is the first sign of the actor and director's maturity. So many others would try to fool around, add flourishes, dramatic touches, etc. Because he doesn't, Affleck reveals the natural drama and excitement in the story.

It is a remarkably accomplished film all around.",1352592000,,6254,4.675454545454546
4880211,4,B005S9ELM6,"Based on the actual historical events from 33 years ago, new Ben Affleck's film ""Argo"" which he produced, directed and starred in, is an excellent picture and a gorgeous thriller. The film recreates the episode associated with the rescue of six American diplomats, who managed to escape from the U.S. Embassy in Tehran during the assault and seizure of the embassy by Iranian militant students-rebels on Nov. 4, 1979, and who found refuge in the residence of the Canadian Ambassador at the time, Ken Taylor. CIA in conjunction with Canadian government had come up with an ingenious and risky operation in saving and extracting the six from Tehran from which even a bird would not be able to fly undetected. The film depicts in details the operation that for long 18 years remained classified. I would not argue that ""Argo"" may not be historically absolutely accurate but am not going to blame its creators for that. ""Argo"" turns to be a fascinating piece of cinema and a very timely film, despite the fact that the story it tells took place over 30 years ago.

For many years, Ben Affleck was for me a lesser part of the creative and friendly alliance with Matt Damon. Matt was ""Talented Mr. Damon,"" and Ben - mostly, a pretty boy whose acting career hit the rock bottom with ""Gigli"", and who became famous as the first syllable in the created by media frenzy compound word Bennifer. I am happy to admit that I was wrong about Benjamin Geza Affleck. Well, he is still the first syllable in the compound word Bennifer, with the different Jennifer though, but he's got real talent as the film director with the sharp clear vision, undeniable craft, and confident style of directing. Ben Affleck is gradually becoming one of my favorite American directors: ""Gone Baby Gone"", ""The Town"", and now - ""Argo."" The latter is without doubt his best work so far and I highly recommend it. I would not be surprised at all that when the awards season arrives, both ""Argo"" and Affleck will be mentioned as the nominees for several prestigious awards. The film has a lot going for it. One remarkable scene follows another. From the first frames, ""Argo's director creates unbearable tension, pulls the viewer inside the screen and holds them there until the end. One of my favorite scenes has Tony Mendes (Affleck) riding a cab from the Airport upon his arrival to Tehran. Pay close attention to what he sees and how short cuts form the streets of Tehran intertwined. For this scene alone, I believe Affleck deserves nomination for directing.

Pay attention how the tone of the film changes with the Hollywood scenes and how much of professional knowledge of starting the film production details Affleck uses. Making two fine actors John Goodman and Alan Arkin playing the roles of two prominent film personalities who agreed to take part in rescue operation from Hollywood, brings real humor in the dramatic and intense story. The final part of the film is purest Hollywood of its best times when the tension becomes unbearable, and I say this with admiration, because these scenes do not depend on the dizzying special effects, but on the pulsing pace, intense interaction among the characters and their emotions, and the flawless editing that cuts among several scenes occurring simultaneously in different and distant from each other, parts of the globe. While watching the film, especially the final chapters, you squeeze the armrest of your chair hard and clench your fists so the nails dig into the palms.

As we grow older, it gets more and more difficult to lose yourself in the movie, which is after all, only an illusion, 24 lies per second. Rarely can a film completely convince the viewer that the line between him and the screen is gone. I am grateful to Ben Affleck for making me forget about that line while watching the best scenes of ""Argo"". I completely trusted him as a filmmaker.

I am not going to talk about plot details here. With this film, the less the audience knows about the plot before they watch the film, the better. I only say that bearded Affleck with longer hair looks as convincing in front as he is behind it. Bravo, Ben! I advise you to pay close attention to the prologue of the film before the credits. Affleck remarkably well used animating technique illustrating historical events that led to the crisis of the American hostages in Iran, 1979-1981. Don't leave the theater the film is seemingly over. It is not. For few minutes we are treated to the epilogue where the portraits of actors and their counterparts are compared, and some details of their after Argo lives are revealed.

I'd like to add few words about John Chambers, the character played by John Goodman. John Chambers was in fact one of Hollywood greatest make-up artists. His most famous work using the prosthetic make-up techniques for numerous ape -people from the first classic film with Charlton Heston, ""Planet of Apes"" (1968) and the characters of the series ""Star Trek"". Chambers was honored with Oscar for his work on ""Planet of the Apes."" It was the first Academy Award in the category for outstanding makeup. Compassionate human being, Chambers also devoted his talents to help with the face restoration to the soldiers disfigured during the war, as well as to cancer survivors.

4880212,4,B005S9ELM6,"In 1979 the republic of Iran erupted into a revolution and Islamic militants stormed and took over the U.S. embassy in Tehran. The militants took 52 American hostages but 6 of them managed to get out a back exit and make their way to the Canadian embassy. In the Canadian embassy, they were also imprisoned, in a way. Although they were safe in the embassy for the time being, the entire nation of Iran was in chaos and they were lashing out at Americans. It wasn't safe to leave and getting out of the country was nearly impossible. Their days in the embassy were numbered and the American government knew they had to act fast to save them.

""Argo"" is based on an improbable but true story that was classified for years until 1996 when President Bill Clinton declassified it. Faced with impossible odds, Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), a CIA officer, was brought into a meeting to discuss how to rescue them. As was described in the film, Mendez came up with the best bad idea they could up with. It didn't occur right away, but the idea was to go through all the actions of a potential moving filming in Iran and fake the hostages as members of the crew scouting out a location to film. Helping him was a Hollywood makeup artist named John Chambers (John Goodman) and Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin).

Ben Affleck directed and starred in the film, not unlike he did with the movie ""The Town. Affleck also directed his brother in ""Gone Baby Gone"". Both movies received critical acclaim and Affleck's ""Argo"" will most certainly follow suit. The authenticity of the film is to be heralded. Affleck, in order to achieve the look on screen that a 1979 incident would look like, Affleck shot the movie on old film and zoomed in on the reel in order to increase the graininess. With the costuming, settings and recreations of the Iranian revolution, Affleck may have achieving the most amazing effect of his career. It takes you back to that time, whether you remember it or not.

Unfortunately, in order to ramp up the tension and drama, Affleck resorted to some typical old Hollywood gimmicks that seemed odd in a historical reenactment. Whether or not Jimmy Carter and the officials stateside reissued the tickets at the last second, as depicted in the film, I don't know, but it sure seemed contrived. This wasn't the only one either. In fact, it happened multiple times. Phones ringing and if that person doesn't answer, the entire operation is dead, but their held up by a studio lot film shoot and don't know the phone is ringing. All was there to ramp up the tension and I guess it worked because the movie worked.

""Argo"" is not a nail biter grit your teeth suspense movie as some have promoted. Had the dangerousness of the Iranian guards been ramped up a bit more, maybe it would have been. Although, you are aware of what they're facing just because we're living it in our current life, but I think the film was too soft on ramping this up, possibly not to offend a culture that doesn't like being offended. The movie is though, an incredibly authentic look into a part of history that remained untold until 1996 and untold widely until now.",1352246400,2,3138,4.598214285714286
4880213,5,B005S9ELM6,"""Argo"" is a thriller genre film based on the rescue mission of six United States embassy staff during the Iran hostage crisis.

Whilst the narrative takes some creative liberties the viewer is nevertheless presented with a gripping story.

The initial absurdity of using a Hollywood film location shoot in Iran, as cover, is the genius which makes this story so engaging, and this combines with repeated adrenalin rushes that at any moment the plan may become thwarted.

A positive message toward seeking non-combative solutions for hostage extraction shines from this work.

Ben Affleck provides a first class award winning lead and the style/costume design was masterfully authentic.

4880214,4,B005S9ELM6,"""Argo,"" directed by and starring Ben Affleck, from a screenplay by Chris Terrio (based on Joshuah Bearman's article in ""Wired"" magazine), is a feel-good movie based on a true story. On November 4, 1979, a horde of angry students and militants scaled the walls of the American Embassy in Teheran. Six Americans escaped and found safe haven with Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor. Affleck plays thirty-eight year old Tony Mendez, a brash CIA operative who specializes in exfiltration--spiriting people out of hostile countries to safety. He teams up with two unlikely allies, makeup artist John Chambers (the always watchable John Goodman) and a Hollywood producer, Lester Siegel (played with his usual zest by Alan Arkin) to bring the six stranded Americans home.

The plan is for Mendez to enter Iran in January 1980 under false pretenses. He pretends to be a film director scouting locations in the Middle East for his new science fiction flick, ""Argo."" Chambers and Siegel had previously launched a publicity campaign, complete with ads in Variety to make their project appear more credible. Days after his arrival, Mendez provides the six Americans, who will pose as members of a Canadian film crew, with false passports. Mendez had quite a few hurdles to overcome. Among theme: to garner the support of the U. S. government for his harebrained scheme; to persuade the frightened and beleaguered six men and women to trust him; and to hoodwink the paranoid Iranians.

This engaging movie has welcome bits of humor to lighten the mood, and the actors, including Bryan Cranston, Victor Garber, and Tate Donovan, all turn in fine performances. The theme could not be timelier, since the United States is still an embattled nation trying to protect her diplomats abroad. Unfortunately, Affleck's direction is at times a bit heavy-handed, particularly in the last fifteen minutes. He and the screenwriter create a clich&eacute;d race against time along with frustrating snags that never existed; this portion of the film feels forced and contrived. Another problem is the intrusive musical score that bludgeons us instead of blending in subtly with the story.

The Iran hostage crisis of 1979-81 takes on revitalized life in this engrossing 2012 movie with great period detail and a well-turned screenplay by first-timer Chris Terrio. The recent Benghazi killings only makes this story resonate more with an event hidden from history prior to 1997 propulsively dramatized here as a turning point in the precarious state of U.S. relations with the entire Arab world. It's fascinating to consider the truth behind the ""best bad idea"" the CIA could concoct to rescue six U.S. embassy workers who managed to escape the compound. There's a blessedly brief prologue chronicling the events that led to the Shah's exile to the U.S. and the rise of the Ayatollah Khomeini and fundamentalist Islam in Iran leading to the tense hostage situation.

The six workers found refuge at the Canadian embassy. With the CIA at a loss to figure out how to sneak them out of Iran, exfiltration specialist Tony Mendez is inspired a bit of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battle-For-The-Planet-Of-The-Apes/dp/B0053EZT4U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battle For The Planet Of The Apes</a>&nbsp;to come up with an incredulous plot to have the six pose as a Canadian film crew who were flown to Teheran to scout locations for a phony sci-fi film that gives this movie its name. Mendez enlists prosthetics expert, real-life makeup artist John Chambers, to help convince veteran producer Lester Siegel to get studio backing for the fake epic. Siegel insists the picture look credible, so he buys an existing script, holds a reading with real actors at the Beverly Hilton, and starts an advertising campaign in the trade papers. All the gears are set in motion as Mendez's boss Jack O'Donnell miraculously gains approval for the far-fetched plan. Mendez flies to Teheran with doctored passports in hand and tries to convince the six to act out their roles with precise detail before they get recognized by Iranian officials as escapees from the embassy.

This race against the clock provides the tension in the film's final act, which comes down to a rather implausible albeit extremely thrilling chase scene at the airport. With Affleck in mostly stoic mode as Mendez, the cast is solidly effective with three unsurprising standouts - John Goodman as the avuncular Chambers, Bryan Cranston as the acerbic O'Donnell, and Alan Arkin who steals all his scenes with ease as Siegel. All the period detail is excellent from the tacky clothes to the Turkish locations standing in for Iran. The slightly washed-out documentary-style of Rodrigo Prieto's (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brokeback-Mountain/dp/B000ICXQS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brokeback Mountain</a>) cinematography perfectly captures the crowded, often squalid atmosphere. There's also an evocative use of vintage TV news clips featuring Mike Wallace's infamous interview with Khomeini. The final explanation of how the real story of the mission unfolded is provided in a voice-over by Jimmy Carter, who was President when it all took place up until the rest of the hostages were released. The film is a genre picture at heart but a historically evocative and emotionally powerful one thanks to Affleck's impressive work behind the camera.",1351814400,2,4119,6.301418439716312
4880216,5,B005S9ELM6,"Ben Affleck (The Town, Gone Baby Gone) took a true story and made a very dramatic and suspenseful film from screenwriter Chris Terrio's (Heights) screenplay based on Joshuah Bearman's original news article ""Escape From Tehran"".

Afflect's choice of dramatic tension and getting some incredible performances, including his own, from this talented ensemble of players was a real surprise. Not having ever been a fan of his acting, more of his writing (Good Will Hunting with Matt Damon), he proved to me now that he not only has the acting chops, but now he can motivate and drive a major motion picture with true passion.

The story is about the six American's who back in 1980 needed to escape Tehran because of a hostile takeover of American citizens working in an American Embassy.  Over 60 American people were held hostage for just over a year. It's a suspenseful look at what real terrorism is and was when, with the help of the Canadian Ambassador, a successful mission was executed under the guise of making a fake Science Fiction film Called  `Argo'. Complete with fake spaceships, actors and laser guns!

Afflect is the CIA specialist who is assigned to find a way to secretly get six hostages out of Tehran without anyone knowing it. With the help of special effects make-up artist John Chambers played artfully by John Goodman (Monster's Inc., The Big Lebowski) who convinces the famous film director Lester Siegel played sharply and honestly by Alan Arkin (Little Miss Sunshine, Get Smart) to produce and direct this fake film `Argo'. John and Alan are incredibly sharp and witty together on screen.

Bryan Cranston (Drive, Breaking Bad) does an amazing job of playing the CIA department chief who waivers from interfering in the rescue to ultimately forcing the president himself to make the rescue a `true'go! Victor Garber (Titanic, Cinderella) gives his usual personal and thought provoking performance at the Canadian Ambassador who takes in these six refugees at the risk of his own and his wife's life. Tate Donovan's (Hercules, The Shooter) plays the nervous and sometimes overzealous leader of the six refugees who must pull off portraying himself as a fake `movie director' in order to keep their cover real.

This movie is filled with tension building scenes and nail-biting moments where you are literally speaking to the screen as if (either in your head or aloud) these characters can hear your excitement and pleas for their safety.  Jacqueline West (The Social Network, Water For Elephants) did an amazing job of costuming for this 1979 - 1980 period as did Kate Biscoe (Contagion, Water For Elephants) who did amazing work on the period makeup and hair.

`Argo' is a film about a Science Fiction film that really didn't happen, but was made to be real with press junkets, PR announcements and even a fake office of production just to help get the six people out alive during a time of civil war in one nation.

It tells an amazing story with amazing performances by a now surprisingly visionary director that is in Afflect. This is not only a piece of history that we all should refresh ourselves with in these uncertain international times, but a film that will literally keep you on the edge of your seat till the last frame. This was a very well made motion picture.",1351555200,2,3298,4.873214285714286

In order to get the 6 Americans out of Iran, Mendez proposes that they pose as Canadian film makers, who are in Iran scouting for appropriate locations to film Argo, a Star Wars-like adventure. When the various options and alternatives (foreign teachers? agriculture specialists? no, film makers!) are presented to US Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, he looks incredulous, but when reassured about the various options available that ""they are all bad ideas. but this is the BEST bad idea we have"", Vance blesses the mission. In order to lend credibility to the idea that he is involved with this fake movie, Mendez and his Hollywood connections set up a fake film company, with a fake film production office, and a fake script, etc. Once in Iran, Mendez gets in contact with the Group of 6, and they are slowly but surely preparing to try and escape out of Tehran.

Several comments: first and foremost, this is a terrific, tense and rousing historical drama, the likes of which we don't get to see often enough anymore these days. In fact, the whole movie experience feels like the movie was made in the late 70s (check out the classic Warner Bros. logo that opens the movie). It is equally clear that a number of events were fictionalized in order to advance the drama in the movie (just to name one: the chase to the plane at the end is a complete fabrication but makes for tense viewing). Other missed facts are harder to understand (for example: at the beginning of the movie, the narrator states that the Shah was ""installed by US and British forces in 1953"" when in reality he had ruled since 1941 as successor to his dad).

This movie is a tour de force for Ben Affleck, who stars, produces and directs. The days of the ""Bennifer"" ridicule are long gone! ""Argo"" is his third movie as a director (after 2007's ""Gone Baby Gone"" and 2010's ""The Town""), and it seems that Affleck is either incredibly lucky, or simply getting better and better with each movie. I'll bet on the latter. There are several other choice performances in ""Argo"", including Alan Arkin and John Goodman as the Hollywood connections providing the fake film production house, but also Bryan Cranston as Tony's CIA superior. In all, this is truly Hollywood at its very best: a smart, tense, engaging drama/thriller, proving once again that you don't need to have the world blown up in smithereens every 5 minutes to engage an appreciative audience. ""Argo"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1351382400,415,2791,4.788381742738589

The only two characters that add interest to this series of cardboard characters are John Houseman and Alan Arkin who have very little screen time.  Overall none of the characters are developed to the point that you know anything about them or even particularly care about them.  There are lots of evil looking Iranians chanting in Farsi and looking like refugees from the Cuban Revolution, but none of them are developed as characters.  There is some effort to develop Menzies as a character but why he and his wife are separated is not addressed.  None of the CIA people seem to have names much less any depth as characters.  Lots of action and some tense moments give the movie enough interest to sit through but there isn't much else here.  The screen play may follow the actual events but it is not an academy award effort.  The costumes follow the styles of the time, but give the characters a sort of comic effect.  I remember the actual event and the anger that the President failed to do anything.  This was completely ignored in the movie and I think Jimmy Carter was mentioned only once with no reference at all to his reaction. Overall a rather pedestrian effort and not nearly as interesting as any one of Bruce Willis's adventures.",1351382400,4,1411,4.608
4880219,5,B005S9ELM6,"Based on a true story with few historical inaccuracies compared to most Hollywood pictures.

This tale will likely resonate best for those who lived during the period of the Iran Hostage Crisis or those who are students of History. During the Iranian Revolution a group of younger and fanatic revolutionaries storm the American Embassy in Tehran, Iran, and take all but six Americans hostage. Those six escape into the residence of the Canadian Ambassador but it's only a matter of time until they're exposed and what begins is a tense thriller in which every hour puts them at risk.

Ben Affleck, who also directed, plays the main character, a CIA operative sent in with an unusual cover of being a movie producer who wishes to film a SciFi picture in Tehran. It's so
crazy it might work is one of the arguments and it's basically the best of the bad choices. Affleck's character plans to pick up the six Americans and have them become a part of their movie covers for this movie and then escape through the airport.

There's a very impressive cast in this picture. Some of them you won't recognize immediately because everybody is in 70s clothes and hair styles (hard to recognize some people through the beards or mustaches). Some of those people were: Bryan Cranson, Ben Affleck (took a couple of minutes to recognize him), John Goodman, Alan Arkin, Tate Donovan, Kyle Chandler and Zeljko Ivanek.

As the credits roll you get to see a comparison of the actor who played a particular character as well as some movie shots in comparison to the actual news shots. I was impressed with the attention to actual TV footages of the time as well as the ""horrible"" suit outfits and hair styles.

In the limited time this picture has been at the theaters it has made more than it's budget of roughly $44.5M.

4880220,5,B005S9ELM6,"To eyes grown used to modern effects, this might seem bland - it's just actors acting. Modern eyes need to see what that means, and this shows it.

Even the acting is subdued - the first two thirds combine documentary, bureaucratic procedural, and claustrophobia. The historical facts and the escap have drama of their own, especially for those of us who remember the events, at least as the media could show them. Lots of scene-setting and character-building. You know, the slow stuff. The drama builds, though, as tempers fray and the gears of the hierarchy slowly grind.

Then, the exfiltration (i.e., escape) specialist arrives on scene. From that point, the movie really begins. Tensions rise with the political pressure. Then, the clock becomes a worse enemy than the revolutionaries. The refuge closes, the cover story demands too much exposure, events move faster than the rescuer. This sustains a ""down to the last second"" breathlessness better than anything I've seen. Think about those Bond movies with the bomb ticking 5..4..3..2..1..... - like that, but with international intrigue on each side of the timer. Tension sustains down to the very last moment, which you'll see for yourself.

And, behind it all, there's a very real piece of recent history. This escape really happened, and in roughly the way the movie shows. (I imagine some artistic license, but it doesn't seem too licentious.) That reality, with everyone a bullet away from death, gives an edge of reality that normal scripting can never achieve. Then, in the trailers, they show the real diplomats side by side with the actors representing them - the matching is just amazing.

This movie needs to be seen. It brings plain old acting and drama back to the screen, and brilliantly. I don't say this often, but I could see this one again, soon. And again, and again.

I can only imagine what would happen had Iran invaded our embassy in 2012 instead of 1979 and held 50 Americans hostage for 444 days! We would be at war and all the hostage would be dead by now. But Jimmy Carter practiced what he preached - and as a consequence - untold thousands of lives were saved by not going to war with Iran even though it cost him his re-election!

For those who are ignorant about geography, Iran is larger than the state of Alaska! In other words, about as large as the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and Germany COMBINED! Tehran,the capitol has population the same as New York City, which is about 8 million! The entire country is 75 million, which is about twice the population of California. According to the Composite Index of National Capability, Iran has the 15th most powerful military in the world! So all you warmongers salivating at going to war with Iran keep in mind we will be fighting the equivalent of two California's simultaneously - with one of the most powerful militaries on earth! I hope you're planing to send your sons, daughters and get a second mortgage on your house to fight a war of this magnitude!

All I can say is to everyone involved with Argo from President Jimmy Carter to Ben Affleck is THANK YOU! Argo is a shining example of the power of cooperation and creativity over force and stupidity!

Director Ben Affleck does an excellent job of providing comic releif early on, and
paying homage to the magic of Hollywood throughout, without leading the viewer to
feel as if the seriousness of the situation is being watered down.

The cast is great, too. Ben Affleck does a fine job (although his best work is

4880223,4,B005S9ELM6,"ARGO is a well-paced and well-acted movie that takes us back to a seminal moment in modern U.S. history, the 1979-1980 Iranian hostage crisis that ushered in the Reagan era. The film focuses on a little-known footnote, the so-called ""Canadian Caper,"" in which six American diplomats bluffed their way out of Iran by posing as a Hollywood production crew scouting a location for a sci-fi film.

The film stars Tony Mendez, a CIA artist and technician (played by director Ben Affleck) who thought up the ruse. He enlists Hollywood makeup artist John Chambers (John Goodman), who won an Oscar for Planet of the Apes and also designed Spock's ears in Star Trek and had helped Mendez upgrade CIA disguises. Aided by a Hollywood producer (Alan Arkin), they mount an elaborate back story, complete with a script, storyboards, posters, and ads in Variety magazine for the bogus movie (Roger Zelazny's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lord-of-Light/dp/0060567236/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lord of Light</a>).

Although the larger landscape of the Iranian revolution is accurately presented, history buffs may be disappointed that the details of the operation itself are distorted almost beyond recognition. Affleck's character looms larger than life, while the American diplomats and their Canadian hosts are poorly developed cardboard foils for his heroics. This slant is not so surprising, given that the film is based on Mendez's 2002 memoir,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Master-of-Disguise-My-Secret-Life-in-the-CIA/dp/0060957913/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Master of Disguise: My Secret Life in the CIA</a>.

But it has earned the film the ire of Canadians, who say it trivializes their pivotal role in the rescue. Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor (Victor Garber), who harbored the fugitives and was instrumental in their rescue, is portrayed as a passive innkeeper taking orders from the CIA. In media interviews, he has called the film ""total fiction"" and ""absolute nonsense.""

Affleck has responded to this criticism by noting that, like many Hollywood productions, the movie purports to to be ""BASED on a true story,"" rather than BEING a true story. ""We're allowed to take some dramatic license,"" he reportedly said. ""There's a spirit of truth.""

The distortions do not end there. A second CIA agent who accompanied Mendez into Iran is absent altogether, as are all mention of a series of potentially fatal blunders by Mendez and the CIA. For example, the CIA map showed the incorrect location for the Canadian Embassy where the agents were supposed to meet their contacts. And on the morning of the escape, Mendez actually overslept, according to accounts of the rescue released after the CIA declassified it in 1997.

The actual exit was also far less dramatic than portrayed in Argo. As described by Mendez in a lengthy narrative on the CIA's official website, the departure went as ""smooth as silk""; ""The Iranian official at the checkpoint could not have cared less"" about the group's paperwork as he stamped the fake passports and exit visas that allowed them to escape onto a waiting Swissair flight (that was delayed due to a minor mechanical problem, not depicted in the film).

Still, While Mendez is overly glamorized in Argo, the CIA is not. The agency is portrayed as willing to sacrifice the diplomats in order to avoid potential international embarrassment.

Shane Bauer, one of three American hikers taken hostage by Iran in 2009, tweeted another flaw, regarding its depiction of the Iranian people: Every Iranian except the maid and the Shah loyalists in the embassy lobby are depicted as ""thugs or part of an angry mob.""

Yet despite - or perhaps because of - all of its distortions, omissions and biases, Argo still works. It is an edge-of-your-seat thriller that is both entertaining and historically relevant. I recommend it.",1350777600,173,3939,5.497520661157025

thriller one would expect from such a topic, namely the successful
extraction of 6 US Embassy workers from Tehran at the beginning of the
Islamic revolution in 1979. Based on a true account, Ben Affleck (who
deserves all acting and directing kudos) maintains a tight leash
throughout, using tension and what-if dread as the main adrenaline
builders. It is a testament to his ability that even knowing the
outcome does nothing to keep you from the edge of your seat. The CIA
operative he plays, Tony Mendez who masterminded the plot, is no James
Bond. He uses his brains, not his gun to achieve his goal, one that
seems insane to his superiors.

The acting is precise and realistic. Comedy relief is provided by
John Goodman as Hollywood special-effects guru John Chambers who has all the good lines.
He and Alan Arkin, as producer Lester Siege,l maintain a rollicking R-rated
banter together. This being a suspense thriller, there are some fabricated
scenes of last-minute miracles (phones picked up at the last second, etc)
but they can be forgiven considering the excellence of the whole film.

Sharp viewers will be treated to modern Iranian history at the intro
and it doesn't put the United States in a good light. When the freely
elected Mohammad Mosaddegh nationalized the Iranian oil industry in
1953, he was overthrown by a CIA coup and replaced with the Shah of
Iran. The Shah was a dictator as brutal and bloody as Saddam Hussein but
as one of the CIA bureaucrats in ""Argo"" suggests, he was a tyrant, but he
was OUR tyrant. In short, you can violate human rights all you want
as long as you don't mess with our oil supply.

The only things that redeem the CIA in this film are that the Islamic
revolutionaries were just as brutal and the bravery of Mendez and his
team",1350691200,2,1849,4.683076923076923

If you recall, Jimmy Carter was president and probably lost the 1980 election to Reagan because the hostages weren't yet released.  It wasn't until 1997 that this side drama was declassified.  When the US embassy was attacked, six staff members escaped and took refuge in the home of the Canadian Ambassador.  A CIA agent and a friend in the movie business cooked up a scheme to rescue them before they were discovered and possibly executed.  This film is a nail-biter of the first order.  Ben Affleck produced, directed, played the agent and pulled all roles off masterfully.  The only weakness in the film is that in his telling of the story, every possible block to the rescue that could come up does come up and at the last possible moment.  This produces a lot of tension that begins to feel contrived.  Nevertheless, it is a very good film.",1350518400,2,971,4.598837209302325
4880226,5,B005S9ELM6,"I remember when this American Embassy was stormed and the occupants were taken hostage. But this film gives that whole incident immediacy and depth. I walked away with a much greater appreciation for what went down.

Here's the scoop. The American embassy in Tehran is stormed. Hostages are taken. Six manage to escape and hole up in the home of the Canadian ambassador. An intelligence operative, Ben Affleck, concocts a plan to mock up a team to scout locations for a fictitious science fiction movie to be shot there. The team will consist of the six escapees and the cover will help get them out of the country. A tough road to be sure.

It is difficult to convey how good this movie is. It hits the ground running with the siege on the embassy. You get a real sense of the fervor building up on the outside and the panic that ensues on the inside. Bodies running back and forth. The shredding of documents and destroying of electronic files. It's out and out mayhem. Then there's the concocting and honing of the plan itself. The people are brought in. The approvals are made and the pieces are all brought together. The doubts build as they are laid out with just about everyone including some of those they are trying to save. But at a given point they cross the Rubicon and it's full steam ahead. Things now get really tense because either it will work or it won't and everyone dies. What's cool about it is, like ""Apollo 13,"" the viewer knows how it will turn out but it doesn't lessen the fear and tension. I was on the edge of my seat. Now my guess is the script was tweeked for the added tension. I doubt the original incident came down to the razor's edge shown in the film, but it made for great cinema.

Great attention was paid to the period. The clothing and hair styles were spot on. The movie was interlaced with actual news footage from the main hostage incident to give it a real sense of authenticity. All the actors handled their roles well. It's always a hoot to see John Goodman and he doesn't disappoint here. Alan Arkin is his usual good self, but everyone, even the secondary characters did a sweet job. They also went to great lengths to make most of the main characters involved look like the originals. Ben Affleck is now 3 for 3 on his feature film directing. He shows a deft hand here. I'm guessing this would hold up well under repeat viewings. For what it is I'd have to say this is as good as it gets.",1350518400,6,2437,4.399113082039912

It is unusual though if they turn out to be good at it, and it's even more unusual when it turns out that they're consistently good at it. Argo is Ben Affleck's third turn at directing a feature film, and after 2007's Gone Baby Gone and 2010's The Town, I have to say that Affleck seems to really know what he's doing.

Argo is a well-paced and tense rescue thriller drawn from a now largely forgotten episode of the 1980 Iranian Hostage Crisis. Everyone still remembers that shortly after the Iranian Revolution, 52 Americans were taken hostage when a mob of students and militants took over the US embassy in Tehran on November 4, 1979 and were held for 444 days, not being released until January 20th, 1981. What many have forgotten though is that six embassy staffers managed to slip out of the embassy before it was overrun and were able to take refuge at the home of the Canadian ambassador, where they ended up staying hidden for 85 days until an elaborate ruse by the CIA and the Canadian government allowed them to sneak out of the country even as the Iranian authorities were closing in on them. With a screenplay written by Chris Terrio based on a 2007 Wired article by Joshuah Bearman called ""How the CIA Used a Fake Sci-Fi Flick to Rescue Americans from Tehran"", Argo now tells that story.

The film begins with the US embassy in Tehran surrounded by a mob of angry Iranians. When the mob begins crawling over the fence and entering the embassy compound, six Americans decide to slip outside of the embassy through a back entrance that wasn't on the main street where the mob had gathered. They end up taking refuge in the house of the Canadian ambassador, Ken Taylor (Victor Garber). When the US government learns of their situation, they start trying to figure out a way to get them out of the country before they're found. To this end, they bring in one of their ""ex-filtration"" specialists, Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), who immediately shoots down the tentative plans they've come up with but doesn't have anything better to offer. At least not until, while talking to his young son on the phone, he tunes into a showing of Battle for the Planet of the Apes that his son is watching. The film gives him an idea: create a fake story about a sci-fi movie that supposedly will be shot in Iran by a Canadian production company, and then, using fake credentials, pass off the six Americans as a Canadian film crew for that movie, in Iran scouting locations, and then fly them out of the country once their scouting work is done. Even with the backing of his immediate boss, Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston), the higher-ups at the CIA are dubious that the plan can work. But they give in when Mendez and O'Donnell point out that all of their plans are bad and that the fake film project ""is the best bad plan we've got.""  The movie title - Argo - comes from the name of the screenplay Mendez eventually picks as the basis for their fake film project.  For as John Chambers (John Goodman) tells him once he undertakes the project, ""Even a fake movie has to have a real screenplay behind it.""

The cast are excellent. John Goodman does a nice turn as John Chambers, the affable Hollywood special-effects make-up artist Mendez turns to for help in creating the fake movie-buzz. Alan Arkin is perfectly cast as Lester Siegel, the veteran producer (a composite character) Mendez and Chambers recruit to help give the fake movie life, stealing every scene he's in with some of the best lines in the film (""If I'm going to make a fake movie, it's going to be a fake hit!"")  Bryan Cranston's Jack O'Donnell is the kind of boss we all wish we had, going to the mat and breaking every rule of bureaucracy and protocol in highly creative ways when Mendez unexpectedly changes the plan at the last minute.  And Affleck himself is brilliant as Tony Mendez, showing a man who's methodical and committed and above all, superbly self-controlled under pressure, but without descending into a cliched action-hero. Affleck's Mendez feels the same strains and tensions everyone around him is feeling and experiences the same doubts - he just never lets it get the better of him. Or distract him from what needs to be done. And last but far from least, Scoot McNairy delivers a stand-out performance as hostage Joe Stafford, who goes from being the one most doubtful of and uncooperative with Mendez's plan to, in a critical moment, stepping up unexpectedly and playing his role as the crew's executive producer to the hilt, convincing the Revolutionary Guards at the airport not only that their film project is absolutely real, but that the story is about a revolt of downtrodden subjects, led by a wise man, who rise up to overthrow a tyrannical alien overlord, deftly turning the B-grade sci-fi plot into an allegory for the Iranian revolution.  What could easily have been a clichd role, McNairy made into something that feels totally authentic, whether it's when he's expressing Stafford's fears and doubts in a plan that would sound dubious even to an optimist, or when he's playing a man improvising like hell in a critical moment, knowing that if he fails he and his friends could all be killed but channeling that fear into unrelenting determination to sell the idea with absolute committed sincerity.  A Best Supporting Actor nomination for McNairy would not surprise me in the least.

Affleck as director does a terrific job of re-creating those tense days, particularly of the situation in Tehran itself where conditions border on anarchy and people are being summarily executed in the streets for anything from being suspected of pro-Shah loyalties to the simple settling of old scores. The tension is palpable from the beginning and Affleck deftly keeps turning it up, making you feel the very real sense of threat that the six Americans are feeling as the passing weeks of hiding in near constant fear take their toll on them. Importantly though, he also shows that it was ordinary Iranians themselves who suffered the most from the chaos and convulsions of the revolution. For all of the harshness of their months in captivity, all of the American hostages made it out alive. A lot of ordinary Iranians didn't.

In addition, Affleck also shows enormous attention to detail, layering the film with inserted bits of period footage and music, filling in the background in which the hostage crisis took place:  the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the 1980 Carter/Reagan Presidential contest, the boycotting by the US of the 1980 Olympics and so on.  And in recreated scenes, he used a special technique of shooting on regular film, then cutting half of the frames and blowing the remainder up by 200 percent to increase the graininess of the footage so simulate the feel of actual news footage of the period.

As with any film based on historical events, there are certain differences between what you see in Argo and what actually happened.  Some were artistically necessary to keep the tension sustained all the way up to the point that the hostages actually left Iranian air space.  Others were made to keep the focus on the core characters and to make the plot narrative easier.  For example, the six hostages were actually hiding out in two Canadian residences and not one, but it was easier to write the screenplay with all of the hostage characters in one residence.  The only important difference that I feel should be pointed out is that the film downplays the role of the Canadians, both in terms of the actions of the Canadian diplomatic staff in Iran and in the extent to which the Canadian government was actively involved in the rescue planning.  The Canadian parliament actually had its first secret session since WWII to grant the six hostages real Canadian passports to make sure that their authenticity would pass any examination.  But all in all, Affleck does a commendable job of making a good edgy thriller without distorting the story beyond any real connection with actual events.

On a side note, the real-life John Chambers was quite a fascinating individual. Few people will recognize the name but many have seen his handiwork. Best known for doing the special-effects make-up in the Planet of the Apes films (for which he won a special Academy Award), Chambers also was the man who came up with Spock's Vulcan ears in the original Star Trek TV series, and worked on TV shows from The Munsters and The Outer Limits to The Night Gallery and Lost In Space and numerous others. Chambers got his start in the Army during and after World War II, where as a medical technician he became involved in reconstructive surgery, creating new ears, noses, and chins, as well as teeth, for wounded veterans. He also got experience in creating prosthetic limbs. This background led to his getting a a job in makeup for NBC in 1953. In addition to his regular work, Chambers also used his expertise and contacts to help indigent cancer victims acquire prosthetics and reconstructive work they couldn't afford. For his work in films and television, he was awarded an Emmy and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. And for his behind-the-scenes work for the CIA over the years, he was awarded their highest civilian honor, which is mentioned in the epilogue at the end of the film where they show picture of the characters in the film alongside one of the real-life people they portrayed. A really remarkable man worthy of a bio-film of his own.

Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys a well-crafted film with engaging performances that keeps the tension mounting and for anyone interested in an interesting bit of actual history.",1350345600,3,9714,4.762782401902497
4880228,5,B005S9ELM6,"This is a superb film. Well-acted, brilliantly directed, and a pleasure during every minute. I had the good fortune of meeting Tony Mendez while living in DC. (And his wife Jonna, who he has co-authored several books with.) As a former graduate student in International Affairs, and as someone with some good background on the subject and some of the people involved, I can assure you that this is an accurate -and very honest- portrayal of this unique (or perhaps all too familiar) time in modern history. The film opens with a solid background of our somewhat checkered past with Iran, then moves on to how the budding theocratic government allows the situation to go terrifyingly awry. Caught in the middle are six members of the US diplomatic crew who manage to escape the embassy during the overthrow and take refuge with the Canadian mission in Tehran. (In my travels, I am always amazed at the decency and generous character of Canadians.) In their desperation to reclaim their Foreign Service officers -who will be tortured and murdered if captured- the State Department turns to the CIA and Mr. Mendez -a specialist in exfiltration. (Mr. Mendez also worked in ""documents"" and in disguise development at other points in his career.) The story is all the better for being absolutely true, and a wonderful example of the creativity and, yes, deviousness of our intelligence services in The US.
  If there is one, understandable, but nevertheless silly part in the film, it relates to security personnel pursuing a departing Boeing 747 in airport vehicles. (I'm a professional pilot.) This is a bit ridiculous because the rotation (or lift-off) speeds of that aircraft are between 160-180 knots (roughly 180+mph) so there is no chance of catching the jet after it advances its thrust levers and has had a few seconds to accelerate. (Also it produces a huge amount of wake turbulence.) This is completely forgivable theater meant to maintain the wonderful and energetic pace of the film. No points lost for that. In contrast, while the entire film is superb (and I mean ALL of it), I must point out one of my favorite moments: the visit to the Bazaar. Having traveled in the Middle East, this part of the film captures perfectly the sometimes nerve-wracking experience to be had in potentially hostile places. Wonderful. Top marks to Mr. Affleck. Buy this movie.",1350345600,,2366,4.927318295739348
4880229,5,B005S9ELM6,"There's not one dull moment in Argo, from the opening scene of a mob taking over the US Embassy, to the final white-knuckled trip to the airport. What a story!  It's so well and deftly told, the viewer is not conscious of the passage of two hours.

The entire cast is excellent, portraying the nuances of terror, the single-minded fanaticism of the Ayatollah Khomeini's henchmen and the mind-numbing US bureaucracy (""So is this the best bad idea you've come up with?"")with equal conviction.  Alan Arkin and John Goodman are splendid as the cynical Hollywood team behind the Argo caper and provide some much needed comic relief (""""Ar, go f*** yourself"" is a running gag).

I don't know who the actor is, and am too lazy to look it up, but the Iranian security officer who questions Mendez et al at the airport is absolutely brilliant.  Well, everybody is, and so is the entire movie.  During the closing credits, when actual photographs from the hostage incident are shown alongside corresponding stills from the movie, and the actual State Department IDs are shown with the actor playing that role, it's astonishing how accurately the movie mirrors reality.

And yes, Canadians are the nicest people on the planet.

For suspense, a step back to the 1970s, an heroic story, and a shining example of how for once, the US got something right, Argo is perfection. If this movie doesn't walk away with every Academy Award it's eligible for, there's something wrong.",1350259200,2,1460,4.858870967741935
