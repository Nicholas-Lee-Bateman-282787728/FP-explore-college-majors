The entire movie is a mess.  The storyline has been drastically changed, the location of the main action moved to another country (hence the French production, who unfortunately didn't have a clue about how to make this type of movie)and most distressing of all is the total lack of suspense, even to the point of not only changing the villain, but revealing the identity well before the end of the movie.  Why Mary Higgins Clark's books have not been given the production values of the film adaptations of other piopular authors, such as John Grisham, remains the biggest mystery of all to me.  Based on this terrible movie, I think it is time for Mary Higgins Clark to think twice before signing any agreements for movie adaptations, unless she can negotiate a contract which protects the integrity of her work.",1342569600,,968,4.643274853801169
