7794284,5,0965060306,My 2 yr old granddaughter loves this movie.  There are really only 2 downfalls for her and that is it is only 20 minutes long and it doesn't go back into playing again when it gets to the end so my daughter has to manually restart it.  Where alot of the kids movies will start playing again at the end.  Just a few small inconveniences.,1456963200,,336,4.138461538461539

7794287,5,0965060306,"Purchased the Baby mammals DVD for my 3 year old daughter who absolutely loves it.  Saw this DVD from the same series and thought it'd be the perfect gift for my 8 year old nephew who loves everything creepy, crawly.  It was a huge hit and I am his ""favorite uncle"".  Perfect DVD for boys.",1406419200,,289,4.218181818181818
7794288,5,0965060306,"My kids were captivated from the start with this DVD. It's a perfect mix of informative (makes mom happy) and just plain fun (makes kids happy) that makes this a winner. My 4 year old daughter loved seeing all of the different animals and my 9 year old son liked hearing new wildlife facts. The show explores critters most kids don't have a chance to encounter close up. If you want something for the your age 3 and up kids to watch that isn't brain candy, this is a great pick.",1406160000,,478,4.263736263736264
