4962337,5,B0066E6QQQ,"For those wondering the quality of the print of this Warner Archive release, please be aware that it is NOT clean and flaw-free.  In fact, I would compare it to earlier releases from the Turner-era, before digital cleaning and repair became the norm.  This print indeed has its minor short-comings.

But to finally be able to see this beautiful classic makes up for the lack of polish and digital magic.  There are no serious breaks in the film stock, and the sound is quite clean overall, so the fact that it is not perfect matters little to me.  No doubt I will be viewing this film again and again for some time.

Enjoy!",1330128000,27,623,4.469026548672566
4962338,5,B0066E6QQQ,"It took us several days to get through the moving and glittery CONSTANT NYMPH, but others may just want to dive in and drown in its luxurious Warner Brothers gloss and the fabulous Korngold music.  As Glenn Erickson says on the DVD Savant blog, THE CONSTANT NYMPH dramatizes the making of a musical composition, the ""symphonic poem"" TO-MORROW which gradually grows and changes and attains its final expression during the course of the film, and this part of the film is a triumphant success.  It is a glorious piece of music and the oddest thing is that when the singer, the glorious Clemence Groves, begins her solo, the chord changes are dramatically similar to those of a much later piece of musical theater, Stephen Sondheim's ""Losing My Mind"" from FOLLIES--and I'm like, hey, that's weird, didn't FOLLIES also have Alexis Smith in it?  I wondered if Sondheim had played around with ""To-Morrow"" when he was composing ""Losing My Mind"" as a tribute to his great star.

Well, maybe it's me losing my mind, but wait till you see it!  As the first reviewer on Amazon I should tell you something about the movie, it is based on a novel that was one of my grandmother's favorites, by Margaret Kennedy, and it's one of those novels, like Dusty Answer by Rosamond Lehmann, in which a young outsider falls in love with an entire family.  In this case, the British composer Lewis Dodd encounters an older master, Albert Sanger, and takes to his entire bohemian setup of girls.  (If you like I CAPTURE THE CASTLE you'll enjoy this one too.)  Hiring Charles Boyer meant that they had to make Lewis Dodd Belgian?  Not French, Belgian, perhaps Belgians were considered more kinky than Frenchmen?  Anyhow it seems crazy that they bothered to make him Belgian but to still keep his very British name, ""Lewis Dodd.""  Many have noticed that the name is strongly reminiscent of that of the creator of Alice in Wonderland, and maybe there's something of the relationship between the real-life Dodgson and Alice in the love affair between young Tessa Sanger and Lewis Dodd.

It reads a bit differently today, then it did when Kennedy conceived of this plot in the 1920s, when girls married younger, but Joan Fontaine is playing Tessa as though she were 14 or so, while Charles Boyer is a rather youthful 35 or so?  Still it's sort of creepy, and it stops you in your tracks once or twice.  Anyhow after her father's death, Tessa and the other girls become dependent on the Creighton family, led by creepy Charles Coburn (actually quite lovable in the film) and his daughter, Alexis Smith--just glorious--perhaps her finest hour until FOLLIES!  Florence (Alexis Smith) marries Boyer during a mistaken moment of adult passion, and she regrets it ever after.  He is the worst husband in the movies, but he retains his charm nonetheless.  Joan Fontaine is astonishing and I can't believe she won the Oscar for SUSPICION and not this!  That little girl act can be cloying and awful like Ginger Rogers in The Major and the Minor, but Fontaine pulls it off through long long stretches of the movie, only slipping from time to time in the second tragic half of the show.  Now who did win the Oscar that year--who stole it from Joan Fontaine?  Let me check.

Oh my God, Jennifer Jones!",1325030400,24,3258,4.720848056537102

4962375,4,B0066E6QQQ,"""The Constant Nymph"" appeared as a novel in 1924 by Margaret Kennedy.  She made a play adaptation two years later, and film versions appeared in 1928, 1933, and this one in 1943.

Under the terms of Margaret Kennedy's will, the film was banned from public screenings after its initial run, and it only now gets its first DVD release, nearly 70 years later.  As one who saw it as a youngster and has now seen it again I make the following comments: -

The plot touches on elements that seem dated, theatrical, even melodramatic.  A composer can live in a palatial home with sweeping staircases and street-wide entrance halls.  His ""great work"" is performed by large orchestral and vocal forces at one of London's great concert halls and broadcast live.  He has a beautiful wife but he bonds much more closely with a sweet, innocent but doomed Swiss girl.

A lush film score was proved by Erich Korngold, involving briefly a wonderful singer named Clemence Groves.  Alexis Smith wears the great gowns of the 1940s, and such well-known players as Dame May Whitty, Charles Coburn and Peter Lorre have small parts.

It is the work of Charles Boyer and Joan Fontaine that best stands up to the tests of time.  Indeed, Joan Fontaine, who regarded this as her best film, was unlucky to be only nominated but not awarded the best actress Oscar for 1943.

The print quality is excellent,  but there are no subtitles.",1402185600,4,1406,4.689795918367347
4962376,3,B0066E6QQQ,"This movie has everything it ought to be. Good actors and a great director. But this is also a movie nothing
really works. Highly recommend by the critics, is this movie disappointing today. Jean Fontaine (my opinion)
is miscast, Alexis Smith don't know what to do with this part and Boyer is just somewhere inbetween. The plot
is just not logical. The best part has Charles Coburn-a great actor. Today the movie is just old and dated.",1398124800,,435,4.662337662337662
4962377,5,B0066E6QQQ,"This was an excellent movie. The acting was superb. the quality was good. Omg and Robert O, lol you will see. i enjoyed this film it starts out slow and builds up to a fun and very touching movie. I highly recommend",1397433600,3,215,4.142857142857143
4962378,4,B0066E6QQQ,"There is something kind of playfully backwards about the whole first half of The Constant Nymph, as we watch these unkempt wilderness children frolic in the woods and vie for the affections of an older and more polished family friend.  Yes, as young Tessa bats her eyelashes and works herself into a tizzy over the unsuspecting Lewis Dodd, struggling composer and aspiring aristocrat, it all feels so delightfully off; like it shouldnt be working and yet it does.  The second half of the film, which takes us out of the wilderness and straight into the upper class, feels like a custom fit, something that resembles what we should be watching.  Together, they work well and yet almost feel displaced; almost.

Aside from some tonal quibbles, there is something rather stirring about The Constant Nymph, and a lot of this is due to the impressive ensemble that works hard at every angle to keep the audience engaged.  Joan Fontaine managed her third and final Oscar nomination for this performance (she won two years before for her uneven work in Suspicion) and I really wish that she had won.  She is such a joy to behold, and yet she never loses her sense of inner dramatics, underscoring her characters inevitable plight.  Better still is the ravenous Alexis Smith who plays Tessas beautiful cousin and nemesis (sort of), Florence Creighton.  Such a powerful presence and so much inner turmoil in a single stare.

I kind of loathed the character arc they gave Florence, but this was the 1940s and they did want to right all conceived wrongs.

With a beautiful love ballad (entitled Tomorrow) to anchor the emotional core of the film, The Constant Nymph suffers from a few tonal issues and some scripting choices but excels with a delightful (and on point) cast and an emotional sting that certainly plays to the films strengths.",1391990400,2,1830,4.836538461538462
4962379,5,B0066E6QQQ,"I have watched this film four times since it arrived two days ago.  It becomes deeper with each viewing.  Erich Wolfgang Korngold's piece Tomorrow is at the heart of the story.  Director Edmund Goulding makes it the driving force of the story.  Although Bernard Hermann's composition for Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much is a fine piece of music, Hitch has it in there as a device to move forward his suspenseful scene.  In The Constant Nymph, the movie rises to a transcendent crescendo as the performance of Tomorrow combines with an other-wordly encounter between Joan Fontaine and Charles Boyer, where their spiritual selves speak to one another saying what their physical selves never had and never would say .  Fontaine said it was her favorite film.  It is easy to see why.  In a scene toward the end and before the performance of Tomorrow, Fontaine says the word ""Beloved"".  What happens in her face just after is acting on a level rarely acheived.  The personality she has had throughout the entire story momentarily drops away as if she has realized her true self.  It is not soft focus or romanticized.  It has the ring of truth.  It combines wisdom and sadness in a whisp of vanishing expression.  I gave it 5 stars because that was all that was available.",1383868800,17,1273,4.701357466063349
4962380,5,B0066E6QQQ,This particular film is a classic and one that I like immensely. Mr. Charles Boyer and Ms. Joan Fontaine are two of my favorite people of film.,1377302400,,143,4.333333333333333
4962381,5,B0066E6QQQ,"I not only remembered the name but the stars of this movie I saw only one time over 60 years ago. It was a movie I saw as a teenager and could not forget with the passage of time. How many movies can you say that about.

I gave this short and simple movie five stars because it far superior to many movies given an academy award today. Frankly it is what I would call a condensed soap opera or a ""B Grade"" which were so popular in the past - in other words a movie worth about 4 stars; but a movie you have a hard time forgetting. To sum it up, the movie makes you feel human emotions which most movies do not do anymore.

Most movies are not only unrealistic but the charactors are dehuminized to objects that will do anything to get what they want. That is why the underlying fabric of our society is crumbling. The old movie producers might not have lived perfect lives; but they did try to give society a model to follow to help the public to surive this imperfect society - specifically a definition of right and wrong - good and evil.",1364342400,21,1040,4.143564356435643
4962382,3,B0066E6QQQ,"I find this a hard film to review.  The story is dramatic but not gripping.  Charles Boyer gives a steady performance but I think he is too old for the role.  Joan Fontaine gives a good performance as the 14 year old who loves him, but my favourite character is Charles Coburn, who on being told that the Italian butler`s name is Roberto, insists on calling him Robert-O.  It makes me smile every time I hear it.

The story concerns a composer trying to write a mastepiece while at the same time, coping with a new wife who is very jealous of the rapport between Charles Boyer and Joan Fontaine and the support that she is giving him. To add to their problems, she has a bad heart.

An OK film but not up to Charles Boyer`s usual standard.",1351296000,2,739,4.280575539568345

8493993,5,B0066E6QQQ,"A brilliantly filmed and acted drama, with wonderful music by Erich Wolfgang Korngold",1515196800,,85,5.615384615384615
8493994,3,B0066E6QQQ,"""The Constant Nymph"" is a perplexing, but oddly moving movie.  It has a good cast, including Peter Lorre, Charles Boyer, Charles Coburn, and Joan Fontaine,  but except for Fontaine they are largely wasted.  Joan Fontaine's performance saves the film.

The plot is allegorical, and as the movie is about a composer, it seems like the sort of fairy tale that might have been adapted for an opera.  Lewis Dodd, a composer (Boyer) is suffering from a block in inspiration, so he retreats to his mentor's decrepit estate in Switzerland for respite.  His mentor, Albert Sanger, is in failing health, but he seizes on a lyrical theme of Dodd's as the foundation for a sweeping tone poem.  Sanger dies, leaving only his written suggestions as an outline for the work.  Sanger has four daughters, one of which (Tessa, played by Joan Fontaine) is smitten with Dodd and his music, and believes she holds the key to Dodd's ""finding himself"" as an artist.  Tess is the embodiment of joy and purity, but she is doomed by her weak heart.

If this melodramatic scheme sounds hackneyed--- it is, undeniably.  Lewis Dodd's problems as a composer derive from his addiction to modern dissonance.  To succeed, he must ""find his heart"", and let his melodies sing.

In the climactic scene, Dodd attends the premiere of his tone poem, but Tessa is left behind to listen to the performance transmitted by the radio.  She also has a white boutonniere that she picked out for Dodd, but which he neglected to wear to the event.  She has packed her suitcase, preparing to exit Dodd's life, when she succumbs for the final time to her heart condition.

It's all a bit ""much"", but classical music fans will find things to appreciate.  Three of the ""old master"" Sanger's daughters play instruments and form an impromptu quartet with their father.  Eric Korngold provides a suitably romantic film score, and their are a few stray references to Beethoven and Wagner.  In the end, though, all that matters is Fontaine's inspired performance.  She really puts her all into creating the character of a devoted ""muse"", and physically she is lyrical, ebullient, and at the end, tragically touching.",1513296000,,2159,4.863013698630137
8493995,1,B0066E6QQQ,"I didn't really care for this film.  An experienced cast, and yet all they seem to overact their roles.  Ms. Fontaine is far too old for her role as the spritely ing&eacute;nue, and Mr. Boyer takes himself too seriously to be believable.  I had high hopes for this film, but I didn't even make it past the first 20 minutes. The story is contrived and uninteresting, young girl competes with Sister for the attention of an older man.  The older man only needs the love of the right woman to become the best he can be.  Good acting might have overcome this predictable plot, but this film has none of that and so I can only imagine.",1486771200,,630,4.35042735042735
