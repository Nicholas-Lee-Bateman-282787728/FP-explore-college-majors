7984138,5,B00008HCAK,"KINO'S AMERICAN FILM THEATRE series is a pricey, space-consuming three volume collection of 14 movies. That's the down side. The rest is all good! These stage plays (adapted to film between 1970-'75) are nothing short of superb. You get the finest works of the greatest playwrights, as rendered by top-notch actors and directors. Audio and video transfers of the restored movies is also first rate. It's a collection ideal for lovers of theater or for any fan of classy cinema. Highest recommendation!

SYNOPSES:

BUTLEY--  Concerns a moment of crisis in the life of an alcoholic college professor, who loses both his wife and male lover on the same day. Students, friends and colleagues take the brunt of the suicidal man's outbursts as he literally falls to pieces.

THE ICEMAN COMETH--  One of Eugene O'Neill's best works is an unrelentingly bleak drama set in the year 1912. In a Greenwich Village saloon, lower-class drunkards and prostitutes await the yearly arrival of Hickey, who always makes an appearance on his birthday. Excellent cast is directed by John Frankenheimer.

LUTHER--  An exploration of the life of the man, who in the 1500s, changed the face of Christianity forever.

THE MAIDS--  Based on a true story of a French woman and her daughter who were brutally murdered by a pair of sisters they employed as servants. In this Jean Genet play, the housemaids dream up elaborate sadomasochist fantasies while Madame is away.

RHINOCEROS--  Absurdist story written by Eug&egrave;ne Ionesco about the inhabitants of a small French town who transform into the horned beasts, all save one man, a heavy-drinking ne'er-do-well. This unusual study of philosophy, morality and culture reteams ""The Producers"" Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder. Watch for a cameo by Anne Ramsey (Momma in ""Throw Momma from the Train"").

Instead of being deprived of these soul enriching experiences they have been filmed and preserved for me - for that I am eternally grateful. On the tech side the ""plays"" look fantastic - the transfers are rich and clean and have been geared for 16:9 TVs. The sound is crisp and clear (don't knock mono, it sounds good on a decent system) and allows you to be immersed in the playwrights amazing dialogue (especially the incredible BUTLEY). This is truly one for the collection (and for you and your kid's educations) - I am buying the rest of the sets and I advise you to do the same - cheers!",1124150400,16,716,4.311111111111111
