2883359,5,B000S88JT8,"What a pleasant surprise to find this 1974 televison film in pristine condition!

Billed as ABC TVs 200th 'Movie Of The Week'

Martin Sheen is excellent as always and is ably supported by Nick Nolte, Stuart Margolin and Michelle Phillips.
Vic Morrow steals the show as Sheriff Roy Childress.
Look fast for Martin's real life brother Joe Estevez, playing his screen brother, at the beginning of the film.",1199664000,23,403,4.911764705882353
2883360,4,B000S88JT8,very cool movie!!! hot rod's rule!!!  i can't get over this was a made for tv movie?,1199232000,,84,3.9411764705882355
2883361,2,B000S88JT8,"A stranger (a very young Martin Sheen of West Wing fame) drives into town looking for a way to revenge his brother who was run off the cliff by vindictive small town Sheriff, Sheriff Roy Childress, played by the late actor Vic Morrow.  Sheriff Roy became such a nasty fellow after he witnessed his beloved wife and child run over by a hit-and-run vehicle, whose owner was never brought to justice.  That set him off on a rampage to nab all speedsters that drove into town.  While it is the judge's idea to set speed traps for errant drivers who are then hauled to the local police station doubling as a ""kangaroo"" court, slapped with a fine and allowed to be on their way with a stern warning, it is Sheriff Roy Childress who took it a step further by chasing and often forcing speeding drivers off the cliff.  The ending was not what I expected but it was inevitable.  The downside of this particular movie, is the way the characters go around planning and executing premedidative murders, all in the name of justice and no one raised an eyebrow until one of their own became the victim.  Certainly not a movie to be recommended for general viewing.",1194652800,,1150,4.5048076923076925
2883362,5,B000S88JT8,"If you are a street rodder the scene when the ""kid"" first comes into town makes the whole movie worth it. Makes me envy Pete Chapporis. I reccomend it to any street rodder like me",1190419200,,179,4.142857142857143
2883363,4,B000S88JT8,"This is a very good TV movie from the mid 70's. The story is about a small town and it's sadistic sheriff(played by Vic Morrow) who has a unique way of dealing with out of town highway speeders. He just rams them until they go out of control and go over the side a famous cliff on the outskirts of the small town. Saves a lot of time and the tax payers money! right? That is until the ""California Kid""(played by Martin Sheen) comes to town looking for his brother, who's missing! I was lucky enough to order this through Amazon when it was available! The DVD transfer is very good, but no extras. I would be happy to have a few classic TV movies on DVD like this, extras or not! Keep them coming! ""Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark"", ""Bad Ronald"", ""The Boy Who Cried Werewolf"", ""Trapped"", ""Dark Night Of The Scarecrow"" Oh the 70's TV movies were great!",1184025600,59,846,4.260869565217392

The acting is good, and there's enough action to keep your interest.  A young Nick Nolte is also in this movie.  I almost didn't recognize him.

2883399,5,B000S88JT8,"DVD  The California Kid (1974 TV Movie)

The Western landscapes used as scenery and the early 70s style reminded me a lot of another made-for-TV movie, Steven Spielbergs Duel. While not as good as that mini-masterpiece, The California Kid has a lot to offer.

The plot is simple but classic. An over-the-top Sherriff, played by Vic Morrow, has a bad habit of chasing drivers and forcing them off the road to their deaths. The film opens with an out of town victim being subject to the sheriffs wrath; prompting his brother (Charlie Sheen) to come to the town to investigate. Charlie arrives in a hot rod with a paint job that screams attitude. The confrontation begins.

Being a TV movie, the pacing is fast but it allows for character development. As well as Vic Morrow and Charlie Sheens characters, you get to know a little about those played by Nick Nolte and Michelle Phillips. The car chases are thrilling with the Western scenery providing the perfect backdrop.

Actors of the caliber of Morrow, Nolte and Sheen are not going to disappoint and they don't here. Since Vic Morrow passed in 1982, this is a wonderful opportunity to see him on the screen. He was a very distinctive villain.

A very watchable film and great value at around $6.",1471910400,,1246,4.692660550458716

I've always said that any actor that can make you hate him, has played his part very well. Vic Morrow (may he rest in peace) did an excellent job in making you dislike him in this movie.
A very young Martin Sheen and Nick Nolte also played their parts with excellence. I'm trying to figure if the Michelle Phillips in this movie is the same Michelle Phillips from the Mamas and the Papas.

In my estimation the film was just OK, Sheen, who never lived up to his potential and did not become a major star, did not deliver a great performance in this film, just a stereotyped '50's brooding, silent hoodlum caricature. The ending destroyed any credibility for this film and any time it comes up in thoughts and memories that is what stands  out for me, a bad ending and a big letdown, disappointing film.",1449446400,,671,4.5

Martin Sheen's testing of his car's ability to take the curve at the scene of his brother's crash is a little corny. It's not even the same sort of car his brother was driving and would thus corner rather differently than his brother's. But it's not too bad.

2883480,4,B000S88JT8,"I think this was a made for TV movie I saw on TV long ago. I bought it because I had fond memories of it.

This is a cross between and old western and a hot rod movie. A boy is murdered on a mountain road in the rural west by a serial killer. His brother comes to town seeking revenge, and justice. It ends in a duel to the death between the brother and the killer in two fast cars on a steep mountain road. Notable for being one of the early appearances of Nick Nolte, who would later become a star in the miniseries ""Rich Man, Poor Man.""",1428278400,,539,3.9

Nick Nolte's character role also was played very well. It always seems that Vic Marrow always plays an arrogant character and plays it well.  The picture quality  was very good considering the 1970's picture quality of that time period.  Being this was a made for T.V. movie,  the editing department accomplished  a seamless transition from one scene to next without having that ""commercial break"" effect that was common back in the day for these made for T.V. movies.

2883549,4,B000S88JT8,"This movie is a sentimental favorite for me.  I saw it when it first came out and it struck chord with me.  I think this was a major movie for Martin Sheen and I think he was perfectly casted.

It seems to be TV movie quality as far as the production values go, but it was made before Lucas and Spielberg changed movies forever.  I don't think either of them did us movie lovers a favor.  I have no problem with the notion that it's just a movie and the blood is fake and no one really dies and story reins supreme. I had no problem with noticing that the The California Kid's lake pipes hooked to nothing.

This was a story about a young guy who was righting an injustice no matter what the consequences to himself.  The writers did not try to 'soup' up the ending and the last shot was perfect. (I don't want to ruin the ending for anyone who has not already watched the movie.)

2883576,4,B000S88JT8,"Being a ""car guy"", and I like to pull out this movie now and then - mostly to see the car - and enjoy it for the ""B"" movie (in my opinion) that it is. The movie is set in the '50s, but the '70s influences when it was made make that a stretch viewing it nowadays. Had it been filmed to have taken place when it was actually made (1973), it would have just taken a few costume and hair style changes to make it happen. The cars used would have still worked just fine. Speaking of which, the ""Kid"" car is pretty representative of what was done in the '50s, but it's the '70s style flame job that stabs at my eyes every time I see it now. Had it been painted with flames more typical of the '50s, the car would have aged a lot more gracefully. Paint job aside, watching the old cars blast through the hills at high speeds is very realistic. They handled like tanks, and watching them get thrown around like that always makes my palms sweat. Anyway, check it out, and add it to your ""car movie"" collection.",1373587200,,1001,4.112244897959184

The camera shows the steering wheel and dash of the Plymouth and it seems to match the year, but the shots of the gas and brake pedal are clearly not from MOPAR.  Very low budget.

It was made in 1974 and for a TV movie, it certainly has an impressive cast.  Seeing Martin Sheen in his 20's is a treat for Sheen fans, and this movie also had Vic Morrow (Bad News Bears, Twilight Zone: The Movie) as a sadistic sheriff and Michelle Phillips (formerly a singer from the Mamas and the Papas), Nick Nolte (48 hours, Cape Fear) and even Gavan O'Herlihy (Never Say Never Again, Superman III).

The story was pretty predictable: Kid seeks revenge from a bad sheriff who killed his brother though it was reported as a speeding accident.

The only problem with this movie is the fact that it's on Blu-Ray.  For Blu-Ray, this picture quality is deplorable. I found it in the discount bin basket at Frye's Electronics.

The Good:

Martin Sheen and Vic Morrow put in great performances.
Music is great, as mentioned.

He quickly sizes up the situation and without explanation develops a plan to expose the sheriff.

2883643,5,B000S88JT8,I saw this movie when I was A young boy I enjoyed it then. I looked for it in stores and on T.V. with no luck until I went to amazon.com and found it. It was just A all out good movie. And would recommend.,1207440000,,205,3.577777777777778
2883644,4,B000S88JT8,"I will admit that I mainly bought it to see the Hot Rod, but the rest of the movie was pretty good too. :D
The story line was pretty good & things flowed well. Seeing the actors in their younger days was pretty neat. The only other movie I've seen Vic Morrow is so far, has been Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry...I liked him in this movie too, he played the part well.",1207353600,,360,4.013888888888889
2883645,5,B000S88JT8,"Most of the reviews have been positive for the 'kid'.
It was a made for TV movie, saw it then and loved it, knew Sheen was going far.
So, 20 some-odd years later and his sons have followed in his footsteps.
One a little closer then the others.
Charlie. Who did a little film called 'The Wraith'.
Any comments to the Platton V. Apocalypse Now connection?.",1205366400,,354,4.378787878787879
2883646,4,B000S88JT8,"this movie I believe was a made for t.v. movie, a classic of sorts with Martin Sheen and Nick Nolte probably in one of their earlist films of their careers. If you like old cars then you should like this film",1204934400,,208,4.097560975609756

2883649,3,B000S88JT8,"I never saw this when it originally aired, but it has held up well for it's time. My only critique is that ""The California Kid"" had a Windsor Ford V8 in it - and does show it in some shots, but when they do a real close-up, it's a small-block Chevy. I guess they weren't as detail-oriented as movies are today. I liked and enjoyed the movie otherwise.",1201478400,14,351,4.176470588235294
2883650,4,B000S88JT8,"This movie kind of put '34 Fords on the map. I,m a car guy and I had to have this one for my collection. I thought it was well done. It was  Nick Nolte's first movie and one of the few t.v. movies worth having.",1200182400,,210,3.6666666666666665

2883652,5,B000S88JT8,I never heard about this movie until my Husband kept talking about it and then finally asking for it for Christmas this past year.  I'll admit it was a great movie with a really cool old car.,1199750400,,191,4.162162162162162
