1854222,3,B00008NRI7,"Many romantic comedies today rely on being cute and somewhat romantic.  They forget the comedy part of the genre description and barely qualify as romantic.
Thankfully, Two Weeks Notice, strives to be funny with it's dialog and uses the undeniable chemistry of it's lead actors Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock to create funny situation after funny situation.  The film only really gives into full fledged Pretty Woman esc romance at the end.  Which was a good choice where the film is concerned because you get to know and like the characters and you care about the outcome of their lives.  The characters are human and make mistakes, the film allows them to be funny yet real.
It is an over all enjoyable film to watch, and if you must choose only one ""romantic comedy"" to see this holiday.  Choose Two Weeks Notice.  Though only a three on the overall movie scale, compared to other romantic comedies to come out in the last couple of years it could get 4 or even 5 stars.
It's a light, fun way to spend the afternoon on a cold December day.",1040947200,7,1041,4.540106951871658
1854223,4,B00008NRI7,"Hugh Grant (as George Wade) went above and beyond in this film, truly brilliant in his comedic timing.  He plays a rich man with no real job, despite the fact that he co-owns one of the biggest companies in NYC with his brother.  As you follow his character, you can't wait to see what he will do or say next to Lucy (Sandra Bullock), his smart, extremely liberal, chief legal counsel.  The only problem is that Bullock doesn't really meet either his wit or charm.  She is cute, and you feel for her character as you watch the interactions between George and Lucy, but the chemistry is only so-so.  She isn't one of my favorite actresses, and I feel she played this character much like she did her character in Miss Congeniality.  Overall though, Grant makes up for all her sometimes on/sometimes off character.  If you like Hugh Grant, definitely see this movie!",1040860800,3,863,4.601307189542483
1854224,3,B00008NRI7,"The romantic comedy genre is pretty generic this day and age and Two Weeks Notice does little to break the mold, but is better than the usual. What praise that can be given to the film is due to the stars, Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant, who work well together to salvage what they can from the generic story and lifeless direction. The duo seem have a decent chemistry and the least you can say about them is that they work.
Bullock is Lucy, a liberal legal aide who puts up the good fight for the little guy in the fight to slow development, while Grant plays George, a leader in the high priced NYC development game who the very ideal person Lucy fights against. He needs a new lawyer that happens to be female and a non-bimbo and, as Lucy happens to fit the criteria, they strike a deal in that he'll attempt to save her community center if she'll agree to work for him. They hate each other, of course, and they're falling for each other w/o knowing it, of course, and they get separated just as they are falling in love, of course, and they are brought back together and love meets them in the middle, of course. Aren't clichs lovely?
But at least it meets the minimum requirements that the lead characters be somewhat likable, and they are definitely that. The story is workable at best, but the actors made due with what was available. Romantic comedy fans are sure to love it while the rest of us our sure to make it through without suffering too much pain.",1040515200,3,1465,4.3699633699633695
1854225,5,B00008NRI7,This movie was HYSTERICAL! The chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant was fantastic...they are a very good match. A definitive must-see and when it comes out on DVD --- a definite must-buy!,1040515200,3,198,5.03030303030303
1854226,4,B00008NRI7,"Paired for the first time these favorites, Bullock & Grant, are a treat for the eye and mood.  What's not to like when you see Lucy, Bullock, play her playful off-kilter, eccentric impassioned character as she and a couple decide to stop the demolition of a historic landmark.  Bullock comes equipped with wet wipes, mats and protective eye gear so demonstrating is less hazardous to their health.
  Rubber-faced, laid back Hugh Grant, a feast to the eyes, plays a likable albeit; slightly inattentive CEO who needs lots of guidance and tends to hire female attorneys with a law degree from some tropical island.  He commanded by his brother, the behind the scenes power to hire someone with a real law degree, like one from Harvard.
  Lucy happens to have the necessary degree and while pestering George, the Grant character, lets it slip she has graduated from Harvard.  Grant asks her to join her in the limo to discuss her current project and Lucy ends up employed by the Wade Corp.  She works for, indeed, baby-sits George for about a year then decided he is too dependent and gives notice.
  Lucy's replacement, makes her slightly uneasy, is this jealousy?  Add to the mix the droll English Grant wit, great scenarios, and prat falls and you have an enjoyable movie.",1040428800,,1272,4.784403669724771

1854228,5,B00008NRI7,"Two Weeks Notice is a really awesome movie. It's funny and romantic, and it's really fun to watch. This movie goes by really fast. It seems like it's only on for ten minutes before it ends. This movie is a romance between a rich boss and his employee, who doesn't want to work for him anymore. This movie is very interesting, and I thought it was really great. I totally reccomend this movie to anyone who wants to see a funny, romantic, and really entertaining movie.",1040428800,4,468,4.453488372093023
1854229,2,B00008NRI7,"Two Weeks Notice marks the first time collaboration between two of the biggest names in romantic comedy.  With a combined resume of past works consisting Bridget Jone's Diary, Notting Hill, Forces of Nature, and While You Were Sleeping, it is quite surprising that it took so long for Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock to work together until now.  Both actors have accumulated quite a fan following, so there is no doubt that the film will be profitable, even in the midst of a month crowded with quality movies, but will it be worth your time and the price of the admission?
A Harvard law school graduate, Lucy Kelson (Sandra Bullock) dedicates most of her time to preserving historical landmarks the big corporations of New York are bent on destroying for the sake of urban development.  In her efforts to save the Coney Island community center, she makes a deal with George Wade (Hugh Grant) of the Wade Corporations.  In return for his promise to keep the building, she agrees to take the job as his new chief counsel.  However, everything does not go according to Lucy's plan.  Instead of her dreams of utilizing the company's vast resources to address issues she is most passionate about and to help those that are less fortunate, she finds herself at George's beck and call, making every decisions from his wardrobe to his prospective dates.  Realizing that this is not what she signed on for, Lucy decides to call it quits, but George refuses to let her go until she finds a replacement for herself, a task that becomes increasingly harder as the days go by.
It is a good thing that Bullock and Grant are both very likeable on screen, because even though the characters they often portray are very similar, you nevertheless enjoy their performances due to the personalities they bring to these roles.  Unfortunately, this is not the case in Two Weeks Notice.  In fact, I found myself feeling apathetic towards Lucy and George, and I really could care less what happens to them.  This is not to say that Bullock and Grant did not try their best, the problem is they had very little to work with, since how can you breathe life to characters that don't have any to start off with?
Although the chemistry is definitely there among the two leads, it just does not seem to work.  To me Lucy and George act more like a pair of bickering siblings than a couple; their constant bantering and arguments did not help to convince me of their unspoken love and attraction towards each other.  I am sad to say that I was extremely bored by the experience, and the laughs are too few and far in between.
The bottom line is that Two Weeks Notice is neither funny nor romantic.  The dialogues are flat and the characters are stereotypically predictable.  Scenes rarely flow smoothly from one to the other, the whole film feels very much like going through a scrapbook where random events are cut and pasted together.  The worse thing about it is the blatant attempt to sell a mediocre story based on the strengths and popularity of two well-established veterans of the genre.  If there is one movie that can make both Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock dull and unattractive to watch, this is definitely it.  I simply cannot recommend Two Weeks Notice, it is clearly deserving of a pink slip.",1040083200,,3275,4.667826086956522
1854230,4,B00008NRI7,Two Weeks Notice had humor that definitely made the audience laugh. Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant delivered their lines with the right effect that made the movie light hearted. I recommend this movie who wants to see a funny movie this holiday.,1039910400,,244,4.833333333333333
1854231,3,B00008NRI7,"In the new romantic comedy ""Two Weeks Notice,"" Sandra Bullock plays Lucy, a very busy attorney with no free time whatsoever. After getting tired of her self-centered boss George (Hugh Grant), she decides to call it quits. As she searches for her own replacement, George thinks he may have feelings for Lucy. The movie is very funny with witty dialogue and slapstick humor. Sandra Bullock is funny, charming, and very fun to watch. She and Hugh have great chemistry. It's kind of romance-flick, but the frequent humor makes it smooth and successful, and definitely noticeable.",1037836800,27,575,5.063157894736842

They only shine when the script shines - and that is not happening here.  There is ZERO to like about this movie.  You've seen it at least a thousand times before.  Maybe ten thousand.  It was written by computer algorithm and you will feel abused and manipulated after its over.  Not one single memorable scene.  Whats scary to me is the number of 5 star reviews?!

George, (played by the nebbishy good Hugh Grant) the promiscuous manchild younger brother who always falls for his assistants, wants an assistant/ lawyer whom he won't be attracted to and Lucy ends up fitting the bill. Lucy isn't terribly likable; shes uptight, slightly histrionic, and seemingly going nowhere in her career. She and George get along about as well as nails and a chalkboard and George, who is likable because hes such a charming non-threatening putz, relies on Lucy for every little detail revealing a self-doubting self-deprecating man that begins to change as hes challenged by Lucys strengths and conscience. The two become unlikely friends at some point, and then they realize that they really care about each other. George the playboy cant really deal with his feelings in straightforward fashion and so hurts Lucy who determines to give her two weeks notice (oho! theres the title). In the end George grows some and stands up to his older brother and parents, but is he too late to regain the woman he loves?

It's a movie that still makes me laugh even being 10+ years old. It's a rom com (romantic comedy). My husband watched it will me for the first time; he even got a few sincere laughs out of it. Bullock plays the spazz and Grant plays the good-ball, what more do you want? This could have gotten a 5 star if the ending didn't feel do rushed with the hotel scene and following scenes.

And having Hugh Grant there is no small bonus. The two have great chemistry, and both actors have the ability to be both incredibly humorous and tender in moments that call for it.

1854478,3,B00008NRI7,"It's decent. I am a huge romantic comedy fan and as always I feel its quite difficult to rate/review movies. Since, it's all really subjective I will keep my review as objective as possible. The character played by Sandra Bullock is very interesting in the beginning of the movie; in fact, I loved the character that they introduced in the beginning. However, I didn't see that person again until the end which was, perhaps, done on purpose. However, it just made the movie slow and dated in parts. There are movies like How To Marry A Millionaire(w/Marilyn Monroe) and Breakfast at Tiffany's that are older movies but do not make you feel as though you are watching an old movie. This movie is not like those. If you like old school ABC family type or ""made for tv"" movies then you'll like this one. If you're jonesing for a romantic Sandra Bullock film then I would go with ""The Lake House"". If you're jonesing for a romantic Hugh grant movie then I would go with ""Love Actually"" (although the movie is not entirely about him). All in all, I don't think it will be a waste of your time to watch, but I don't think it's worth $4.00 to rent.",1457222400,2,1141,4.438095238095238

1854561,3,B00008NRI7,"Romantic comedies are one of my secret loves.  When done well, they leave me with a huge smile on my face.  Sadly, they can be very hit or miss, and Two Weeks Notice certainly didn't live up to its potential.

Lucy Kelson (Sandra Bullock) is an attorney who is trying to keep her neighborhood in New York City from being torn down and taken over by huge, soulless hotel complexes.  When she goes to plead her case personally to George Wade (Hugh Grant), the owner of the chain, she is surprised to find herself offered a job as his general counsel.  She accepts on the condition that he will build in other neighborhoods.

A year later, Lucy is fed up with constantly being on call and being expected to advise him on everything, including his clothes.  So she quits.  George, realizing he doesn't want Lucy out of his life, begins to look for any excuse to keep her from leaving.  What might the two of them realize?

Really, I feel like the movie needed another pass or two on the draft before it was filmed.  There are so many story threads that are started and dropped only to be picked up again that it feels disjointed.

On the plus side, this movie is filled with some pretty fun banter between the leads.  I had to laugh at several of their exchanges.

And the characters are genuinely fun to be around.  George is a rich playboy, but he is likeable, and Lucy is easy to identify with right from the start.  Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant do great bringing their characters to life, and the rest of the cast is great at backing them up.

However, the movie definitely believes that a some clever banter is enough to let us know the characters love each other.  I have a hard time with that in some of the classic movies of the genre from the black and white era, and I have just as much trouble with it now.  As a result, the ending seems forced and a bit anti-climatic instead of the emotionally satisfying one I was expecting.

Yet there is something about this movie that makes it work despite the flaws.  I think it's the leads and the characters they bring to life.  I know I'm repeating myself, but they are fun to spend time around.

So Two Weeks Notice winds up being average since the leads manage to raise it above the weak source material.",1433116800,,2257,4.372596153846154

1854615,2,B00008NRI7,"Halfway into this video, Sandra Bullock becomes distraught because she had a fight with her boyfriend and they are breaking up. Nothing unusual about that in terms of a plot line, correct? That would be true except for the fact that we haven't heard one peep about this boyfriend for the first 45 minutes. He was never mentioned by name, he never showed up in any subplots, she was never seen talking to him or referring to him in any capacity. The only small reference was something in passing that her father says while he was talking to her on the phone in a brief scene. So either the editing was sloppy or the writing is bad. With that said, the one reason to watch this movie is Hugh Grant. Grant is charming, funny, and an overall joy to watch on stage. He's as good or better than he ever was on the screen. Sandra Bullock plays the same character in this movie that she's played in her last several movies.  She's got a narrow range and does well within those parameters but her charm is too familiar and becoming stale at this point.  I wanted to love this movie but two stars is as much as I can muster.",1417910400,,1114,4.3

The incredibly handsome, incredibly rich, incredibly successful businessman is an idiot who can't pick out his own wardrobe and a male who spends his work time worrying about which color letter envelopes he uses while giving $100 tips to hot dog street vendors. Really? I like comedy, I like fun and I like romance. This film has none of those. Rewatch Pretty Woman, you're time will be better rewarded.

Lucy does this against her better judgment and ends up being at George's beck and call 24/7, running her into the ground with his rather selfish needs and requests.  Luckily, George is utterly charming and handsome.  He does tip the scales in the favor of being TOO SELFISH when he actually calls Lucy out of a wedding in which she is the Maid of Honor to help him pick out some clothes...Lucy puts in her two week notice.

Moving this plot to the current events of today, you have an Occupy Wall Street lawyer, member of the 99%, meeting and going to work for a member of the evil 1%. They have nothing in common, but....well you can probably see where this is heading. I know it's a familiar theme for a rom/com; but what takes this one to a higher level is the superb comic acting of Sandra Bullock as Lucy and Hugh Grant, as George...probably the two best comic actors of the modern era. In addition the script is intelligently written and this film is very funny...LOL-funny in places.

If she had just gone to Harvard that would have toned it down a bit. However, she certainly allowed herself to look vulnerable in so many ways that all of that is offset by that.

Unfortunately it does in spectacular fashion.

Zero chemistry is never a good start in a romantic movie, and two very funny people are let down by an unfunny script.

The film feels like it never quite starts - I spent the whole thing waiting for the story to kick in - and then it's over.

Very disappointing. I expect the commentary and bloopers are the best reason (if there is a reason!) to buy this movie.

1854754,2,B00008NRI7,"Sandra Bullock is Lucy, a pro bono lawyer passionately devoted to saving the community from rapacious developers.  One day she is lying on the pavement between an historic building and the wrecker's ball when she meets playboy George (Hugh Grant), the public spokesman for the very corporation that wants to knock down the landmark.  George is between lawyers at the moment (his CEO brother fired the last one), and when he finds out Lucy actually has a degree from Harvard, he impulsively offers her a job and a promise to spare her Coney Island rec center.

And from there on it was just annoying.  A couple of critics called this screenplay undernourished; I'd say emaciated.  The best romantic comedies have a busy, likable supporting cast to add layers of interest and tone to the primary storyline (remember Notting Hill and While You Were Sleeping?); Grant and Bullock were pretty much on their own.  The two of them, mostly just the two of them, George`s outrageous insensitivity and Lucy's indignation in the same tiresome pattern that begged for denouement long before Lucy finally gave her two weeks' notice.  What bridesmaid leaves her cell phone on at the altar of her best friend's wedding, anyway?  And it still took too long for this to end.  Grant had a lot of witty one-liners; but I thought he was too offhand, as if contemptuous of the material.  Bullock was charming, but not charming enough to save this mess.

Obviously, production costs were kept to the minimum.  Locations were unvaried, supporting cast almost invisible, cinematography bland, clothes blah.  Bullock as Producer must have figured that two big stars would bring in the audience before word spread how awful this really was.  And she thought this romantic comedy was so good, she couldn't possibly make a better one?  I'm pretty charitable when it comes to a movie of this genre.  It only has to look good, sound good, and make me feel good.  This one was zero for three.

I've learned something.  If you're reading these reviews in order to decide whether or not to purchase the dvd, don't go by ""Most Helpful"" reviews.  People get on here and vote Yes, it was helpful, when they have already seen the movie and agree with the review.  This tends to inflate positive reviews.  Instead, look at the star rating profile at the top.  If most people really loved the movie and you probably will, too, the profile will have a bulge at 5 stars tapering down smoothly to a very thin or non-existent tail at 1.  If instead of a smooth descent from 5 the distribution is lumpy; or especially if 1-plus-2's add up to about the same as the 5's, maybe you ought to rent first.  Take a look at this one's profile.",1346025600,5,2691,4.710920770877944

Sandra Bullock is brillant in the role of an idealistic, activist lawyer who goes to work for him as part of a bargain to save a community center. Their romantic chemistry is good, and their comedic chemistry, amazing. It's a lighthearted, clever, feel good movie that never gets stale. The commentary featuring Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant is almost as funny as the film itself.

Too often movies will try so hard to be great but they slip up in one or more categories.  It's annoying to watch a movie that seems to be fantastic only to blow it at the very end by doing something 'cute' but while trying to be cute it breaks the logical consistency it's strove for up to this point.

Two Weeks Notice doesn't do that at all.  It's logical, funny and cute all the way through while at the same time maintaining the sexual tension between Bullock and Grant very well.  There is one scene with Bullock needing to use the restroom and using an RV that stretches the logic a bit but it doesn't go too far.  All in all, great movie.

Bullock is a lawyer who fights for what she believes in, but somehow agrees to be hired by Grant, who runs the type of firm that Bullock is always trying to stop.  Their witty banter is hilarious, and Hugh really fits his role.  One exchange starts with Bullock expressing, ""You are the most selfish person on the planet!"", and Hugh responds, ""Now that's just silly, have you met everyone on the planet?"". You can almost picture Hugh Grant saying those words, and it's writing like this that make this such an extremely popular movie.

You don't feel like the movie drags on, which is not always a given with movies over 90 minutes (this one is 101 minutes long).

I bought this movie for my wife because it was on her Christmas list.  She is a huge fan of stars like Cary Grant and movies such as It's a Wonderful Life', which we now watch every Christmas together.

1854768,5,B00008NRI7,"In 28 Days Sandra Bullock has 4 weeks to get through rehab and start to be funny. Here, she only has Two Weeks Notice, but the film is twice as funny in half the time. Hugh Grant is so charming that he was able to restart his career after he was caught with his pants down with Divine Brown. He made the Mea Culpa circuit on the talk shows, admitted his mistake with a boyish grin, and all was forgiven (though he probably still had a lot of 'splaining to do to his girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley). Anyway, oftentimes when I see a Hugh Grant or a Sandra Bullock film, I am very skeptical at first. Sometimes they are a bit much. But seeing them together, I bet that they would be fantastic. Each would balance out the other, or so I hoped.

Thankfully, I wasn't wrong. As far as the Romantic Comedy genre goes, it doesn't get any better than this. Their characters are opposites that attract, like Sam and Diane on Cheers. Hugh is a business man / Real Estate developer--kind of a Donald Trump with better hair and a British accent (BTW, Trump does a cameo and a Trump home is used for one of the locations). Grant is George Wade, a classic conservative, while Sandra plays Lucy Kelson, a liberal lawyer given to defending the poor downtrodden, and as a result, she is pretty poor and downtrodden her own self.

-----------------------------
Meryl Brooks: Come on, I've known you since Brownies, and the only time I ever saw you cry was when Bush won.
Lucy Kelson: Which one?
Meryl Brooks: Well, both of them.
========================================

George Wade hires lady lawyers strictly for their looks. His brother tells him that has got to stop:

-------------------------
Howard Wade: You need someone who can write a brief instead of removing yours.
================================

Seeing that Lucy is a bright lawyer, he offers her a lavish salary which she accepts. He is banking on the fact that they are really not each other's cup of tea, and so will not be distracted from the business at hand. All goes extremely well, but George begins to rely on Lucy more and more.

------------------
Lucy Kelson: What did I tell you that defines an emergency?
George Wade: A large meteoroid, severe blood loss and uh... what was the other thing?
Lucy Kelson: Death! And you're not dead!
=============================

It is at this juncture in time that Lucy gives George the Two Week Notice referred to in the title. She begins interviewing replacements, and none seem suitable, or even adequate, until in walks a bright young redhead fresh out of Harvard, June Carver (Alicia Witt). June moves in for the kill, and soon Lucy is feeling quite a bit jealous, realizing too late that she has fallen in love with the dashing and debonair George. June usurps her role and becomes his date for a charity function that he had originally invited Lucy to. June wears a top hat that is so Betsy's Wedding it isn't funny, or maybe it's a little funny, but it is mainly just very hot, a black top hat instead of a white one. For me, this was an unexpected treat. Alicia Witt is not only beautiful, she is smart, too. Intelligence, not power, is the ultimate aphrodisiac, my apologies to Henry Kissinger.

---------------
June Carter: Do you know what I like even more than chess?
George Wade: Pokmon?
======================

Strip Chess? Wow. With Alicia Witt? What could be more tantalizing than that? Don't worry; it is all very tastefully done. But wait a minute; we are supposed to be in Kelson's corner. We are rooting for Lucy, not June. So Alicia Witt plays June as just a bit of a... well, you know.

Alicia Witt got her start in David Lynch's Dune, but I remember her as Cybill's daughter Zoey Woodbine on Cybill's sit com, Cybill. She was a smart and sassy redhead who played piano. In real life she was a classically trained pianist who used to play the piano at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel. She was also kind of a child prodigy. At the tender age of four she appeared on ""That's Incredible!"" (1980) to show off her amazing reading skills, and she also performed the balcony scene of Romeo and Juliet with the host. Her mother, Diane Witt, was in the Guinness Book of World Records from 1988 to 1996 for having the world's longest hair. One wonders if it was also red, and what a splendid sight that would make. Alicia herself modeled what is purported to be the most expensive hat ever made, the $2,700,000 Chapeau d'Amour designed by Louis Mariette, at Christie's in London. Last time I saw her was as Miss Pasternak on 2 and a Half Men, where she was devastatingly cute, though her character was a little bit crazy.

Director Marc Lawrence is an expert at crafting Rom Com vehicles for either Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock. He wrote Forces of Nature and Miss Congeniality, and he wrote and directed Two Weeks Notice, Music and Lyrics, and Did You Hear About the Morgans? Since he is so adept at creating and filming material for both Grant and Bullock, you'd expect a film with the two of them together to be a slam dunk. And it is.

Marc Lawrence has a good ear for music, and he even plays harmonica on the opening track, a re-mix of ""Baby, You've Got What it Takes"" performed by Dinah Washington & Brook Benton. Other featured musical performers include Counting Crows featuring Vanessa Carlton, Perry Como, Mel Torm, Xavier Cugat, Fountains of Wayne, Aretha Franklin, Stanley Turrentine, James Brown, Bachman-Turner Overdrive, Michael Bubl, Norah Jones, Dusty Springfield, Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway, and Al Green. Norah Jones, doing the Hoagy Carmichael, Ned Washington chestnut ""The Nearness of You"" even performs her number in person. Other great musical moments were when Hugh Grant's character George Wade struts to ""Papa's Got a Brand New Bag,"" and when they repurposed Bachman-Turner Overdrive's ""Takin' Care of Business"" to mean the number 2 meaning of business.

Bottom Line is that Two Weeks Notice is a five-out-of-five star Romantic Comedy, and the material is perfect for both Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock to work their particular brand of magic on. Added bonus is Alicia Witt, who really stirs things up. She can be my check mate, any day. It is a silly, frothy mixture, but it goes down so smooth and satisfying.

George Wade: Divorce always gives me an appetite. Kabob?
Lucy Kelson: No thanks. I've never really warmed to the idea of a *flesh* popsicle.

The story is basically about Lucy who goes to work for George Wade's multimillion company as an assistant in exchange for Wade's help to keep a local Community Center standing and not have it torn down to build a new shopping development. Later as she goes on working for him she gets fed up about the lack of attention and respect that she receives so she gives him her 2 weeks Notice. What happens after that is a budding romance between Bullock's and Grant's character that leads to pleasant and surprising twists and turns. At one point in the movie when Lucy gets frustrated she calls Wade ""the most selfish man on the planet""!

I'll tell you what you have; you have one extremely funny, and rewarding, cinematic experience.  `Two Weeks Notice' does just that.  It pairs the very `British' Hugh Grant with everyone's favorite `train wreck' Sandra Bullock and it allows the two of them to play off one another brilliantly.

Sandra Bullock has been quoted as saying that she is in no hurry to film another romantic comedy because she has already filmed the perfect one; `Two Weeks Notice'.  I have to agree (although I thought `While You Were Sleeping' was equally `perfect') for this film is hilarious from start to finish.

The film follows Lucy Kelson, a lawyer who makes it a practice of fighting against large corporations who are bent on tearing down the community to make profit.  One such corporation is Wade Industries.  When she accosts Wade's posterboy George Wade she finds herself being offered a job.  If she takes the job then her precious community center will be spared.  She agrees and thus starts the crazy relationship between employer and employee.  Lucy soon discovers that working for George is a fulltime job; as in 24-7.  When Lucy decides she has had enough she gives George her two-week notice; but quitting Wade proves to be more difficult then Lucy expected.

Like I mentioned, Sandra and Hugh play off one another magnificently.  Their humor matches the other beautifully and lends itself to some magical comedic moments.  This is one of those pairings that makes complete and total sense; one you wish they would revisit very soon.  While Lucy and George are nothing new to Bullock and Grant respectively, the characters seem fresh because they finally have a worthy partner.  Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock compliment one another; they complete one another.

The film also has some worthy supporting characters.  Dana Ivey and Robert Klein play Lucy's parents Ruth and Larry and play off one another wonderfully as well.  Larry is the concerned and affectionate confidant while Ruth is the challenging opinionated mother who sets expectations for her daughter to reach.  Heather Burns (who also stars alongside Bullock in the two `Miss Congeniality' films) plays Lucy's best friend Meryl and while she's not as memorable as she was in `Miss Congeniality' (that may be due to considerably less screen time) she still does a fine job.  Stealing the supporting brownie points is Alicia Witt (when is this girl going to get a gig that really emphasizes her talent?!?!) who just mesmerizes as June Carver, the lucky hopeful training to take over Lucy's job.

In the end I must say once again that `Two Weeks Notice' is hysterical.  Sure, it is clichd (but never to a fault) and it is predictable (but in a good way) but it is so genuinely charming and so well constructed that you can't help but enjoy it to the very last drop.  Bullock and Grant soar together.  Here's to hoping they team up for a sequel (or at least another film).",1207612800,4,3164,4.845437616387337

1854786,5,B00008NRI7,"TWO WEEKS NOTICE is one of my favorite movies. There. I said it. Read on to see why I love this movie.

TWO WEEKS NOTICE is the story of Lucy (Sandra Bullock), a very. . . It's hard to describe her. She aspires to be a great lawyer - and in truth is - but she settles to work at Legal Aide and do pro-bono work instead of going and making money. Until she meets George Wade (Hugh Grant!).

George Wade is a multi-millionaire businessman, the face of Wade Corporations. He hires Lucy while he is in need of an assistant. They make a bargain - she'll work for him and help him get his building built, but he must keep the Coney Island Community Center. This works - for a while.

Lucy finally gets fed up with George's late night calls and strange demands and his lack of R-E-S-P-E-C-T (see movie for joke). So she gives him her two weeks' notice. But the thing is, Lucy is in love with George, but is too prideful to admit it.

This movie is so well written and well done overall. Hugh Grant does a wonderful job as George, whether you want to admit or not. He and Sandy Bullock may not have perfect chemistry, but they are so funny together. There are moments in the movie that make me laugh out loud. And I rarely laugh out loud.

LUCY: I think you are the most selfish person on the planet, George.

GEORGE: That's just silly. Have you met everyone on the planet?

See this movie. It's genuinely funny.",1179532800,6,1404,4.235955056179775

1854789,3,B00008NRI7,"The creators of this civil, well-mannered comedy seem to cater to the old cliche of the impossible romantic pairing, but be warned: this is not a story of two opposite forces clashing against each other and, eventually, realizing how much they have always needed to get together. Here we have a rather aggressive lawyer and a rich, decent guy who falls for her. It's as simple and polite as that.

Bullock's self sufficiency doesn't seem to be needing Grant's decency for a minute. When she finally declares herself to him (he's been lovestruck all the while) it's only because he agreed to give her exactly what she wants. She must be falling as a 'thank you' gesture. Does she seem to really need Grant? The motivational arc seems to imply that she should only because a woman cannot live by herself.

There are other minor problems with this movie. We have a silly scene with a cellphone ringing in the middle of a wedding. The reasons of this are explained verbally in the subsequent scene. But there has been no set-up for the silliness, and the verbal explanation is pat and a cop-out.

Then we have a lot of scenes where people and cars move into the frame from right-field towards left. This is most annoying and signifying a backward pull in the visual development of the narration. The cinematography by Laszlo Kovacs is greyish and uninvolving. Kovacs is a master, and to be sure he manages to impart a consistently dull color tone to the whole proceedings. It must have been a stylistic requirement, yet the fact that all of the the natural daylight is cloudy doesn't sit well with this kind of stuff.

The director/writer succeeded especially in extracting two believable performances from the stars. ""Two Weeks Notice"" is pleasant enough. No big laughs, though, just polite smiles.",1165017600,2,1795,4.780645161290322
1854790,4,B00008NRI7,"""Two Weeks Notice"" is a romantic comedy about Lucy, an idealistic and gutsy Harvard law school graduate (played by Sandra Bullock), who is hired into a prestigious law firm by the firm's jet-setting partner, George (portrayed by Hugh Grant).  George's brother owns the firm.

George enjoys considerable wealth and perks afforded by his position.  He is handsome and rather charming, and he is divorced after philandering.  Lucy and George are direct opposites.  Lucy is from a working, middle class family.  Her mother is a law professor and her father is an attorney with a social conscience.  George seems to have inherited his privileged lot in life.

Like her father, Lucy is compassionate towards the underdog.  Her latest crusade is an attempt to save a community center located in an aging building.  George's brother wants to demolish this building and replace it with a profitable high-rise. He expects George to close the deal on this project even though George is conflicted because of his increasing  respect and admiration for Lucy.

When Lucy leaves the law firm in favor of pro bono work, her replacement is a pretty, ambitious, and calculating young Harvard graduate who immediately sets her sights on George.  Complications arise because Lucy has feelings for George and vice versa.

""Two Weeks Notice"" is a competent comedy.  However, to thoroughly appreciate its story, one has to be sympathetic to the lead characters.  Lucy is a person of integrity and conviction.  George only begins to develop these qualities because of his association with Lucy.  For most of the movie, George is a shallow, materialistic womanizer.  It is doubtful that these two would actually end up together.

Still ""Two Weeks Notice"" is a fairly pleasant diversion especially if you are fans of Bullock or Grant.  These two talented actors give the movie more appeal than perhaps it deserves.",1161043200,,1888,5.104575163398692

Reminiscent of the Doris Day/Rock Hudson comedies of the sixties, this movie brings us Bullock as a legal aid lawyer who has been raised to stand up for causes she believes in, even if it means getting arrested in doing so.  Her latest foe is a corporation run by none other than Mr. Grant, who plans on tearing down the beloved community center on Coney Island.  Grant strikes up a deal that he'll spare the building if she comes to work for him.  Despite the protests of her parents, including Robert Klein as her feisty dad, she accepts and finds herself helping Grant pick out his clothes, ties, colognes and other personal duties.  After a while, she decides to give her two weeks notice and trains her replacement, a wispy young redhead named June Carver (Alicia Witt), who makes a play for the handsome womanizer.  From there, it's just a matter of time till the ill-matched pair realize they'e in love and one can certainly guess where the movie ends up.

Bullock and Grant are in good form, with Grant getting all the good lines, and the film uses contemporary pop songs effectively, letting the music mirror the particular scene.  If you like this kind of lightweight comedy, you'll probably like TWO WEEKS NOTICE.",1139184000,2,1418,4.689516129032258

1854813,4,B00008NRI7,"Hugh Grant seems to have perfected the role of playing the spoiled young Rich person.  In many of his films, this is the role he has been cast into - and he has done a brilliant job at perfecting his character in each of these roles.  I've become a big fan of Hugh Grant's - not because of the characters he plays, but because he probably has become the top actor in his profession when it comes to Romantic Comedy films.  Whether it's physical comedy, dry humor or even witty humor, Grant always seems to come through.  Once again, Grant comes through big time in the Romantic Comedy ""Two Weeks Notice"".  In this film, Hugh Grant is teamed up with Sandra Bullock.  Grant once again delivers a terrific performance, but the surprise of the movie comes from supporting actress Alicia Witt.  Witt shows why she is a rising talent in Hollywood.

The film takes place in New York City with an emphasis on Coney Island in Brooklyn.  The story of the film involves Bullock's character Lucy Kelson.  Lucy is a crusading attorney seeking to save a Community Center in Coney Island from Demolition.  The company that is trying to demolish the center is the Wade Corporation - which is led by Hugh Grant's George Wade character.  George is a young handsome and popular New York Real Estate Developer.  When Lucy confronts George on the issue, George offers her a job as his Chief Legal Counsel.  Lucy decides to take the job as it will give her the resources to fight for many of her causes.  Lucy moves into her new job, but instead of providing legal counsel to George on business matters - she soon finds herself giving advice and counsel to many personal issues involving George's life.  Lucy soon finds herself at George's beckon-call on almost everything.  Getting frustrated with George's dependence on her - Lucy offers her resignation and gives George's 'two weeks notice'.  George accepts Lucy's resignation and Lucy agrees to help find a replacement.  The replacement turns out to be Alicia Witt's June Carter character.  When George begins to hit things off very well both professionally and personally with June, feelings of jealousy begin to surface.  At first, neither George or Lucy can admit feelings for each other - but things end up very predictably in the end.

As mentioned, Hugh Grant delivers another stellar performance.  While in movies such as ""Nine Months"", we've seen Grant able to pull of the physical comedy, we see Grant focus on his witty sense of humor. Throughout the movie, Grant comes back with several one-liners and these are delivered flawlessly.  An example of this is when Lucy tries to find another job and George calls all prospective employers trying to stop them from hiring her.  Lucy gets wind of this and confronts George.  Lucy tells George ""You called everyone but Slurpee Heaven"".  George responds ""That is not true.  I did call Slurpee Heaven.  They didn't want you.  Said you had attitude.  Said you weren't Slurpee material"".  This is just one example on how Grant is able to pull off the character of George Wade perfectly.  There are numerous examples of this.  While on the surface, it may seem that anyone could pull of this witty humor - I find with Hugh Grant this is genuine and it works.

I've always found Sandra Bullock an overrated actress.  While Bullock has a good fit at playing the ""high maintenance""  Lucy Kelson character,  While even after seeing Bullock's Lucy Kelson character, I still think she is overrated - I do think there was good chemistry between Bullock and Grant.  ""Two Weeks Notice"" does employ a common Romantic Comedy formula of two people not getting along - but being drawn close together.  Bullock and Grant's chemistry seems to fit this formula well, thus makes the movie enjoyable.
As mentioned above, I felt Alicia Witt became an emerging star in this movie.  Witt does a great job at playing June Carter.  At first June is the timid new-hire out of college.  But Witt does a great job at transforming June into the young opportunist that becomes the perfect rival for Lucy Kelson.  While I wouldn't tag June as the ""villain"" of the movie, she clearly is pitted against Lucy in the movie - especially when it becomes clear that June's real motives are more for George himself as opposed to the job.

One thing I really enjoyed was the New York City setting for this movie.  While I've always preferred Hugh Grant when the setting is in England (""Nine Months"" and ""About a Boy""), I like that how Grant fits into New York City and Coney Island.  Parts of the film were shot on-location in Coney Island.  While I think it's a fair criticism that the film doesn't show the real Coney Island (an area of Brooklyn that still is in need of being cleaned-up), I do think the film does a terrific job at showing that there still are some positives about the Coney Island area.  The film also features a Helicopter ride that George and Lucy take - that gives a great view and insight of New York.  There also is a terrific scene filmed on the Queensboro Bridge when Lucy is in desperate  need of using a bathroom, but unfortunately is in a major traffic jam.

There are some interesting cameos in the movie.  New York Mets Catcher Mike Piazza has a cameo when George and Lucy are at a Mets game at Shea Stadium.  Donald Trump (whom is portrayed as George's Real Estate Developer rival for obvious reasons) has an encounter with George as a fundraising party.  Finally, Norah Jones has a cameo as a Piano Singer.

Overall, this is a great movie to check out.  Romantic Comedy and Hugh Grant fans will not be disappointed.  But even if you aren't a fan of these two - there is a great charm to this movie.  Highly recommended.",1119744000,,5698,4.656970912738215

I'm not saying I wanted it to end where she rejected him, that wouldn't be any fun, but I am saying that maybe if they would have skipped the whole, dramatic speechs, and kept it funny it would have been more original, and enjoyable.

1854817,3,B00008NRI7,"Let me get a little personal bias out of the way right up front - I don't like romantic comedies as a movie genre. In fact I can't think of a single decent one off hand. They are overwhelmingly unoriginal, unfunny, and unromantic star vehicles that fail to even accomplish their stated goal and contribute nothing to the world of film. So the fact that I don't hate this film says something I suppose.

A movie like this plays heavily on the audiences existing belief that opposites attract in order to make the unlikely romantic connection more plausible. I don't know how true this common belief is in reality - I suspect it is not as successful as the saying would have us believe. Plus it creates plenty of good comedic situations when the two opposites interact.

Hugh Grant is pretty much a lock with female audiences - every punch line he delivered got a strong response from the audience no matter how lame. The film establishes early on that Grant's character is really a good guy deep down but is unduly controlled by his older brother - a convenient excuse.

I find Bullock fairly believable in her slightly novel role as a grittier, career driven leading lady. It first emerged in Miss Congeniality in which Bullock plays a tough as nails FBI agent working undercover as a beauty pageant contestant. However her character creates what I would call a critical plot flaw in Two Weeks. The film would have us believe she is a class leading Harvard lawyer - yet she hesitantly accepts Grants deal to work for him on the condition that his company spare her beloved community center from the wrecking ball. She writes an air tight employment contract that is so strong she cannot find a way out of it when she needs to - and at the same time fails to lock in the only thing she really cares about in the condition that the community center be saved. Have the standards at the vaunted Harvard Law fallen so low?

A little bit of trivia: Coney Island is also the setting of one of my favorite films Requiem for a Dream. Sandra Bullock reminisces about the old neighborhood at one point and mentions an old couple, the Goldfarbs. Sarah Goldfarb was a lead character in Requiem and I'm guessing this is more than just a coincidence. Also in Requiem, director Aronofsky recalls in the director commentary that the famous and historic Thunderbolt rollercoaster was bulldozed in the middle of the night by a wrecking crew on the orders of then mayor Rudy Giuliani during his ""cleanin up NY phase"" in an attempt to avoid any such protests. It was replaced with a parking garage. This lends some credibility to Bullock's struggle to save the buildings around Coney Island. You will notice the distinct lack of rollercoaster in Two Weeks.",1101859200,,2735,4.644628099173554

I won't lie that this film falls victim to the formulaic conventions of most romatic-comedies, but the screenwriter presents the characters in such a way that you forgive it all.  Both of the primary characters are entirely sympathetic in all aspects, even the rich, handsome, bastardly Grant.
At the end, you adore Bullock for much the reason Grant does.  Despite her nerosies and non-sense, her heart is in the right place.  And while Grant's character is less-sympathetic, you truly regard him as an unwitting villian... one by way of creation, rather than one by way of nature.
Ultimately, it's a story for adults and an adult love... the sort that smacks you in the face, just when you think that you're too old to fall victim to emotion versus rationale.  The scene where they pick through one another's lunches speaks volumes to any person who's ever loved someone they hated.  How could you love someone who loves beets?  Maybe because they love beets when you don't.

1854824,2,B00008NRI7,"Fresh of watching ""About A Boy"" I felt like Hugh Grant could do no wrong, so despite less than stellar reviews I decided give ""Two Weeks Notice"" a shot, which was a mistake.  While there are some comedic moments, this a romantic comedy and Bullock and Grant have NO chemistry.  In most of the scenes they seem only mildly aware of eachother mostly focusing on thier actions.  As a result, I never felt like they should be together.  Further, the plot seems to jump around.  Right after getting hired, the plot leapfrogs to weeks later where Grant and Bullock are now supposed to be chumy, but I never felt it.  THey seem to be tired of eachother and their action forced by the plot's simple-minded purpose.  After his great romantic comedies of the 1990s, this a huge step down for Grant and even for Bullock, who mostly makes bad movies anyway.  This is not worth your time because it clearly wasn't even worth the actors full attention.",1078358400,7,938,4.574850299401198

I decided that I wanted my roommate at school to watch with me so I started the movie over and watched again from the beginning taping it this time. This movie was quite hilarious!  Hugh Grant and Sandy Bullock had great onscreen chemistry.  Hugh's accent is to die for!!!!!

Good points: Along with all the character flaws both Wade and Kelson have, the film is careful to develop redeemable character traits along the way as well, making both characters human rather than unsalvageably neurotic. Very human in-fact, I know people in real life like these two. They're also careful to show that both characters do actually have similar interests in life so it's not completely head-scratching to see them falling for each other. Oh and the romance is never sappy, so for those who are a fan of subtle expressions, furtive glances and baffled reactions, this is the film for you. Bullock and Grant might be playing their usual roles but those roles are definitely very compatible, at least in this film. Chemistry is present and makes the film work.

Handsome Hugh Grant and quirky Sandra Bullock make up this thoroughly enjoyable movie, from Lucy (Bullock) ordering huge portions of Chinese and laying under wrecking balls in protest, to George (Grant) and his little boy attitude. A delightful watch. Enjoyed this movie as much or more than ""While You Were Sleeping"" also starring Bullock. A must see for a Sandra Bullock fan (me)!!!

1854853,4,B00008NRI7,"Not sure why everybody is yawning over this one. I bought it sight unseen because I like both of the stars. I was not disappointed, and have watched it three times already.
There is strong chemistry between these two, reminiscent of Day/Hudson and Roberts/Gere. Yes, the storyline is far-fetched, but if I wanted to be smacked with reality, I'd have bought a documentary.
There are a lot of laughs in this film, and a fairy-tale ending. Things I remember most: Mom's body language around Grant; the RV scene; the Milk-Dud shrew; ""What baby?""; the waterfront party; ""Don't be silly. Have you MET everybody on earth?"", and on and on.
Loads of bonus material, too, including two deleted scenes and a bloopers version of the movie (great fun).

1854854,3,B00008NRI7,"Writer/Director Marc Lawrence and star/producer Sandra Bullock scored a direct hit with their surprisingly good ""Miss Congeniality.""  So, in ""Two Weeks Notice"" they get the band back together.  This time, insert Hugh Grant for Ben Bratt, and change the Bullock ugly duckling-to-swan transformation storyline to start with hippie, crunchy granola lawyer instead of athletic, disheveled undercover cop.
In other words, all quite formulaic.  And it would all be worth dismissing outright were it not for the charm and verve of the two stars.  Bullock is the best physical comedienne working in film today.  Check out her tipsy boat scene in which she declares herself a ""twisty, bobcat pretzel.""  It's a classic.
And Grant is back to his classic stuttering, fluttering persona, to good effect.  What can only be called his 'Hugh Grant-like' reaction to Bullock in 'twisty, bobcat pretzel' mode is also great fun.  [This*is* acting though.  He needs to get credit for that.  See 'About a Boy' to see what Grant is capable of when he's asked to dig deeper for a character.]

1854857,2,B00008NRI7,"I suppose I expected too much after just watching Miss Congeniality. This movie was slow and too political. It constantly insults conservatism but gives no grounds for doing so. As liberalism often does. Now, I could insult Democrats all day, but I'd do it with facts and give reasons for doing so. And don't get me wrong, Republicrats aren't much better than Demopublicans...however, conservatism is a lifestyle and for some reason it's the only lifestyle Hollywood, liberals and just humans in general have full rights to degrade and insult(by the way, conservatives are not ALL red-necks). That just seems very HYPOCRITICAL to me.
NONE of that changes my original point...this movie is hardly funny(if at all), not all that interesting and not at all entertaining. The mushy ending felt forced, in fact...it felt so forced, I wanted to smack the both of them and serve them their future divorce papers right there!

1854863,2,B00008NRI7,"Both my daughter and I looked forward to seeing this film. I am a big fan of both Sandra Bullocks and Hugh Grant, as they are charismatic and talented actors with a feel for comedy. Unfortunately, even they cannot overcome a witless script and the ham-handed direction of Marc Lawrence.
Sandra Bullock plays the role of neurotic Lucy Kelson, a Harvard Law School grad who follows in the footsteps of her activist parents by becoming an activist lawyer.  Hugh Grant is in his element as George Wade, a real estate developer and playboy tycoon. When they are brought together by fate,  they strike a deal that they believe would be in each of their respective best interests. Lucy will work for George as his chief counsel, while George promises not to apply the wrecker's ball to her beloved Coney Island community center.
Unfortunately, as time passes, these two opposites begin to be attracted to each other. Just as fate contrived to bring them together, however, it appears that fate will also tear them apart. When Lucy discovers that George will be unable to keep his promise about the Coney Island community center, she gives him two weeks notice. Enter June Carter (Alicia Witt), also a Harvard Law grad and Lucy's replacement. The luscious June quickly sizes up George Wade and sets her cap for him, causing Lucy to suffer pangs of jealousy of which she had been previously unaware.
There are no surprises in this formulaic film. Hugh Grant does his slightly wacky British turn, while Sandra Bullocks  turns in another intelligently ditzy, infectious performance.  It is the script and the direction, however, not the actors, that jettison this remarkably unfunny, romantic comedy. The laughs are few and far between. The dialogue is one dimensional and cartoonish. It fails to build a believable romance between the two main characters. Quite frankly, all the film does is waste the considerable talents of Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullocks, as well as the viewer's time. It is an unintelligent, pedestrian film that would otherwise have tanked but for its star power.",1062547200,15,2074,4.9511494252873565

The comedic timing of Hugh Grant is impeccable, as always.  Sandra Bullock also is completely believable as the crunchy-granola lawyer.  The two have great chemistry, and are quite funny together.  There are a couple of pee your pants laugh lines in the first half of the movie.
It's the second half that slows down once we introduce the inevitable 'jealousy' of the love triangle. The director is clumsy with editing--the secondary characters are not firmly established enough in our minds to be interesting on their own, though the parents are quite fun.
In all, this could have been a huge hit with a more experienced director.  Instead, it's going to amuse, entertain and charm--but it won't stand out in your mind as a classic.",1062374400,,789,4.822222222222222

Hugh Grant & Sandra Bullock have great on-screen chemistry, and the dialogue is very witty in places. I won't go into all the plot details - if you haven't seen it, you should, and if you have, you already know what happens - but for me the best part of the movie was the depiction of the relationship between George (Grant's character) and Lucy (Bullock's character). Yeah, they argue, disagree, drive each other crazy, etc, but there are a number of cute scenes showing just how much they've come to mean to each other while working together. For example, watch out for the scene where they're having lunch and, without even pausing in their conversation or seeming to notice what they're doing, take food off each other's plates.

1854868,3,B00008NRI7,"This is another one of those movies that could have easily been a boring flop had it not been for Hugh Grant.  I've often said that I think Grant has impeccable comedic timing, and this is what saves this movie.
This DVD came out around the same time as Maid In Manhattan.  If you could only see one, make it this one -- MIM was a snoozer.  However, that doesn't make this one come out smelling like a rose.  The premise wasn't bad -- Sandra Bullock plays a Birkenstock wearing lawyer who is not at all caught up in the trappings of success (largely b/c she has no $$), but winds up working for an irreverent, playboy executive in an attempt to save a building in her neighborhood.  See the movie to see how that transpires exactly.  At any rate, it's a culture clash.  Along the way, love blossoms unbeknownst to either party until the end ... of course.  The movie is predictable, but again, Hugh's humor saves the day.  While Bullock comes off as whiney much of the time, she garners just enough sympathy and has enough beauty to pull it off.  Hugh is the star of this show though.  It seems right up his alley to play the suave, albeit shallow, playboy (About A Boy, Nine Months, etc.), so he plays it well.  We should be disgusted by him right along with Bullock, yet he's endearing and likable as ever.  And his quips and one-liners really hit the mark.
Bottom line:  Don't go into this movie expecting a laugh-fest, but do expect Grant's consistent and ongoing comedic flair.  Don't go into this movie expecting a warm and fuzzy Kate and Leopold-esque feeling, but do expect to root for Bullock at least over her sleazy adversary.

The first half of this movie is great, Hugh Grant is hilarious and Sandra Bullock manages to be cute and intelligent at the same time, and these characters are completely believable.  Grant has a line where he says ""My life is a lot like Monopoly"" ( which had me rolling ) and sadly the movie is a lot like Monopoly, in that it is a 'board' game and I found myself very 'bored' in the last half of the movie.
This movie is hilarious enough in the first half that I watch just that part then turn it off, because I know what is coming.

1854871,4,B00008NRI7,"This very cute film stars Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock as two very different people (she's a super-environmentalist, hippie lawyer who would do anything for her cause(s), he's a millionaire construction developer with few responsibilities and a carefree, somewhat arrogant attitude (but hidden behind all that is a man with quite a heart, and a great, witty sense of humour.)
Despite their differences, the two are drawn together by circumstance, and despite of (and sometimes because of) their bickering, and what they learn about themselves and each other through all their funny little escapades, come to realize that they are perfect for each other.
When we meet granola-esque attorney, Lucy Kelson (Bullock), she is on a mission to save the local community center on Coney Island, where she grew up. When she has a chance meeting with high-powered businessman George Wade (Grant) on the sidewalk outside his building, they find that they each have something the other needs. She needs his backing to ensure that the community center won't be displaced by a massive new construction project, and he needs a new chief counsel for his firm.
When she mentions she went to Harvard Law, he immediately offers her a position. She takes it, somewhat hesitantly, having heard of his reputation through the grapevine, (he had til then been more interested in dating his attorneys than consulting them). Comedy ensues as the two butt heads as they go about their business, literally, in their hugely disparate styles. He is mellow, quirky, quick with his jokes and one-liners, she is professional, tightly-wound, in control, but not entirely content in the role. One gets the feeling that she wouldn't mind loosening up around the edges, relaxing a little.. if she could just learn to delegate a little, and/or count on her new boss to hold up his end of the bargain once in a while (which he doesn't really see as that much of a priority, at least at first.) As the two share some highly stressed and emotionally charged, and then eventually some relaxed, enjoyable times as they go about their days together, they slowly come to realize, as Lucy prepares to leave Grant's employ, that they are falling for one another.
There's a song that goes, ""You don't know what you got til it's gone,"" and this movie amply highlights that turn of events.. once Wade faces losing Lucy, he starts to realize how dependent he's become on her, and how empty his life would be without her, how much he'd miss her if she wasn't there to pick out his ties, shop for furniture together, cope with the latest business or personal catastrophe, or just exist, side by side, in life.
This film embraces some romantic comedy cliches and avoids others, basically making it a fresh, if somewhat predictable foray into romantic comedy-dom. I really enjoyed it, as with most of Grant & Bullock's films.. it's a great date movie and a solid entry into the romantic comedy genre. If you're in the mood for some witty one-liners and a lot of laughs, plus a cute story with well-rounded characters a la When Harry Met Sally, this one's for you.",1059004800,,3108,4.854990583804143

The ending didn't hit home, and overall, the film wasn't very good. If you are looking for a good romantic comedy, don't bet all your money on this one.",1056931200,2,401,4.220779220779221
1854879,3,B00008NRI7,"Sandra Bullock is one of the best-looking butt-of-the-joke movie comediennes in showbiz, and a savvy producer to boot: She's carved a respectable if not overwhelming niche in the romantic and dramatic comedy market by helming high-gloss, middle-brow, self-depreciating entertainments aimed at the easygoing set. Bullock is not as gifted as Reese Witherspoon  or as high-wattage as Julia Roberts, but, to use an adage of old folks across America, you could often do a lot worse.
 For ""Two Weeks Notice"" Bullock was able to drum up Hugh Grant to play opposite her romantic lead, which is a kind of testament to the credibility she's built for herself over time. Grant doesn't look particularly comfortable at times in the movie, especially during its second half, but he doesn't phone it in as he did in ""Mickey Blue Eyes.""
Grant, as a playboy real estate mogul, and Bullock, as his long-suffering liberal lawyer, tap dance through the opposites-attract opening before Bullock offers her notice to quit, frustrated with her bosses' inability to commit to the importance of his work. A subtle rival (gorgeous Alicia Witt) arrives to take Bullock's place, and, as many of Bullock's movies do, Witt plays a type of smart, sexually subversive lass instead of the straight heavy.
That takes much of the wind out of the comedic sails of ""Two Weeks Notice"" while pressing the button of intricate female drama. Watch how, with great precision, the rivalry comes to head over a tiff on a particular piece of office equipment Bullock would like to take as a memento; most male critics bemoaned the lack of villainy in Witt's performance, but women better recognize the type: sweet, manipulative, a little too willing to be seduced, the minx disguised as a mouse.
Bullock and Grant have decent chemistry, though it does not match up with the chemistry Bullock had with Ben Affleck in ""Forces of Nature"" or the cop/criminal attraction she had with Gosling in ""Murder By Numbers."" When Grant's funny, ""Two Weeks Notice"" is funny; when he's thrown into earnestness by the movie's second half, ""Two Weeks Notice"" is left with Bullock v. Witt, and as foxy as Witt might be in a strapless bra, Bullock wears her chaps of charm and bulldozes the event.
It's hot and cold, here and there, daft and sad, a little neurotic: ""Two Weeks Notice"" is a stock Bullock comedy.",1056240000,,2346,4.921717171717172
1854880,2,B00008NRI7,"TWO WEEKS NOTICE is clearly an attempt by director Marc Lawrence to herald in what he hoped would be this generation's Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn. What made Tracy and Hepburn resonate with the audience was that despite their on-air bickering, one could see that there was a core of misguided, if not misplaced, emotion bubbling to reach the surface. But with Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock, what became apparent from the opening reel was that while both have the star power individually to carry a romantic movie, collectively they simply do not bounce off one another in a manner that lets the audience grow to care about their deliberately emphasized differences. And in films like TWO WEEKS NOTICE, it is the degree to which the audience connects to these differences that mark such movies as truly engaging experiences. Unfortunately, TWO WEEKS NOTICE does not ring true in any area that counts.
Hugh Grant is George Wade, a multimillionaire real esate developer who is rich in name only. His more unattractive brother has wisely allowed him to stand as the sexy and successful symbol for Wade Enterprises. George is unabashedly handsome in the self-deprecating manner that has long since been the essential Hugh Grant trademark. He flits from affair to affair, all of which costs him plenty, but since he has his rich brother's money to back him up, he can afford to buy a hot dog and pay for it with a $100 bill, and not ask for change. In his job as company spokesman, he is incredibly incompetent. He does not even know what suit to wear for a social function, much less decide when and where to build a monstrous condo that only a Trump would love. Enter Lucy Kelson (Sandra Bullock) who is everything that George is not. He is egotistical, hedonistic, and much aware of his shortcomings in business acumen. Lucy is modest, altruistic, but possessed of a huge ego that manifests itself in a desire to Save the World from evil developers like George Wade. Now these differences might have been enough to generate humor and audience attachment to the actors had these actors showed even a glimmer of compatability. Instead, director Lawrence tries to show a Tracy-Hepburn sense of appealing squaking by contrasting some rather appalling scenes of grossness. Lucy Kelson has just eaten a chili dog that she warns is about to make an unexpected appearance. George is then forced to find a handy toilet, and since both are in a car on the FDR Highway, it takes somes some doing to resolve in a way that is more nasty than humorous. Far too many of similar such scenes remind the audience that what they are watching are actors trying vainly to be lightly and humorously romantic. Not for one moment can one willingly suspend one's belief to enter the world of a romantic comedy that Grant and Bullock try so hard but in vain to achieve. The fault is not theirs, since both are appealing in scenes in which they appear solo. The problem is a poor script that relies too heavily on the sight gag and the pratfall. I would like to see them try again, but this time with a plot that does not suggest that the entire process of filming required somewhat more than two weeks to complete.",1056153600,2,3193,4.703571428571428

1854885,4,B00008NRI7,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! I'm a Bullock fan and (sort-of) a Grant fan, the combination was wonderful! Bullock plays a lawyer who works for legal aid doing ""good"" by protesting the destruction of anything with any sort of importance to someone.  Grant plays the playboy in charge of a company who plans to knock down most of the things that Bullock is trying to save.  By a twist of fate, she ends up his lawyer.  This way she can be sure he uses his millions to do good.
The chemistry plays out brilliantly - and naturally.  When Bullock decides she cannot bear to work for him any longer and gives her 2 week (more like 2 month) notice, he informs every potential employer that he can't do with out her.  She agrees to find her replacement for him- who ends up being a pretty, sexy red head looking to bed the boss!  This finally makes Grant & Bullock realize they have feelings for each other.
Grant's witt and humor are all over this movie and combining him with Bullock's charm makes this a winner!  The traffic jam scene will crack up any audience!  Grab some popcorn and enjoy!

This one is worth buying to keep for future viewing!

1854892,2,B00008NRI7,"Being a fan of both Miss. Sandra Bullock and Mr. Hugh Grant I looked forward to what I felt would be a fun movie, unfortunately I was to be quite disappointed.
Miss Bullock's character lacked the manic energy she has frequently displayed and that this story badly needed.  Her character, Lucy Kelson, had a great deal of potential, which a lackluster performance did not deliver.
Mr. Grant's performance was better, but not markedly so.  The `one liners' he delivered had little punch and even less humor.  The chemistry between the two main characters, necessary in this type film, just didn't seem to be there.
The one bright spot was Miss. Alicia Witt, as June Carter, a sort of rival to Miss Bullock's character for the affections of Mr. Grant.  Her performance had energy, humor, the vulnerability of youth and at the same time the sense that she was potentially a predator manipulating the situation for personal gain.

I go to movies with these people in them to see them play fun and loveable characters. The DVD extra ""two bleeps notice"" is disappointing.

The problem is, 2 Weeks Notice isn't as original as either of those, but it still may be the more enjoyable of the three. Both Hugh Grant and Bullock have done these roles before and this script has definitely been done before.  Bullock plays a hard working lawyer who cares about the community and loves to protest the Wade corporation who is always tearing down some important building to put in a parking lot.  Ironically, Grant is sort of the CEO of WADE and Bullock ends up working for him and surprise...falling in love with him.  Another one of those girl falls for extremely selfish rich guy and rich guy gives it all up to prove he really loves her stories.  The love story is a little unconvincing and the plot is nothing new, but its a harmless romantic comedy that is far from the worst of the genre mostly due to some funny moments and decent performances from Bullock and Grant.  Actually, Bullock said in an interview that after this film she was going to slow down on the romantic comedy roles...good for her. Keep your eyes open for unsubtle cameo by Norah Jones.  It's like one of those music videos for a film soundtrack that intercut film clips with the artist performing only look!  There's Norah Jones right in the movie!

1854899,3,B00008NRI7,"""Two Weeks Notice"" is another pleasant, mildly diverting romantic comedy from Sandra Bullock's production company. The director, Marc Lawrence, also wrote the script. He was responsible for penning [but not directing] two other Bullock successes, ""Miss Congeniality"" and ""Forces of Nature"". If ""Two Weeks Notice"" to those films, it's only because the co-star is the marvelous Hugh Grant, who could make a movie about constructing chicken coops charming and funny. The difference between Ms. Bullock and Mr. Grant is that she is only as good as the material she is given, whereas he can rise above even the most mediocre script.
In this romantic romp, Bullock plays Lucy Kelson, a Harvard educated lawyer from Coney Island. She battles to save an historic community center from being destroyed by a billionaire real estate tycoon, George Wade [Grant]. Charmed by his promises to save the center, she winds up working for him. Eventually, the job proves too frustrating for her because her solid work ethic clashes with his playboy attitude. She gives her notice, which he seems to accept cheerfully. During the course of her working out her notice, it becomes clear that, while they can't work together, their relationship may work out on another, more intimate level.
The film romps happily and swiftly through it rather flimsy plot. Issues like the community center's being saved naturally take a back seat to the issue of Lucy and George's relationship's being salvaged. The problems are that the dialog isn't that sharp and that most of the jokes fall a bit flat. Still, Bullock and Grant have a pleasant enough chemistry and are obviously having a good time. One can only hope that Bullock will soon find a writer who can successfully hone in on her true comedic talents. In the right hands, she could be the funniest leading actress in movies today.",1052006400,6,1854,5.003236245954692

Sandra was hilarious in ""Miss Congeniality"" and Hugh was good in both ""About a Boy"" and ""Bridget Jones' Diary"". If you are looking for a romantic comedy for the entire family then I suggest you get this movie, because there was no sexual situations and most of the sexual humor will fly over the kids heads and there is like one or two mild bad words (I heard only one but it was only ""hell"" and there is no other language from what I heard).

1854915,5,B00008NRI7,"Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock are two of the most charming and amusing actors working today. These same characteristics resonate through their movie, Two Weeks Notice. A throw back to the screwball comedies of the 1930's and 1940's, Two Weeks Notice is so much better than most of the movies being passed off today as romantic comedies. There is some very witty and intelligent banter between the characters. Effort is made by the writer/director Marc Lawrence to make the viewer understand why George (Grant) has never lived up to his potential and why Lucy (Bullock) the overachiever, still falls short in the eyes of her mother. As with any opposites attracts movie, the two are destined to collide and bring out the best in each other. This is not a groundbreaking movie, but in this day and age when movies seem to be increasingly reliant on special effects, it is a pleasure to be entertained by a movie that is instead carried by the chemistry between its two leads.
The DVD version of Two Weeks Notice gives the viewer the opportunity to get a glimpse of the affection shared by Bullock, Grant, and Lawrence for each other and the fun they had making the movie. Much like the commentary Bullock and Lawrence did for Miss Congeniality, the Two Weeks Notice commentary, although not particularily insightful about the making of the movie, does offer a peek at how funny and engaging these individuals are in real life. The Two Bleeps Notice feature that can be enabled while watching the movie is wonderful as it allows the viewer to see some hilarious outtakes in the context of their placement in the movie.

Don't get me wrong -- it's highly watchable and isn't bad, and it's something I'll enjoy renting in the future to watch again. But the sparks, the chemistry that I expected just fizzled. Sandra Bullock's character was too stiff -- and there was no back story to indicate why despite the distracting presence of her character's parents. As for Hugh's character, his family (brother, mother and father) were ever-present, but their was no explanation as to why he was the way he was.  The movie wanted you to develop this sympathy for these two lost lonely -- but funny in a quirky sort of way -- souls, but I found myself looking at my watch 40 minutes into the film.
Bottom line: I think the movie just tried too hard to cash in on Sandra Bullock's past successes. Is it coincidental that her character's name is Lucy -- the same name as her character in her best (in my opinion) movie to date, ""While You Were Sleeping""? And the role of ""best friend"" is the actress who played her fellow contestant who turned into friend in ""Miss Congeniality"" (another cute movie). Sandra Bullock's a good actress...but she needs to stretch her acting chops and get past the romantic comedies as she's quickly outgrowing her abilities in this genre...it's becoming ""been there, done that"" with her.

It was solidly written, and directed. The cast gives a solid performences and the sets were great, they were all live in NYC. This is a great film and I can't wait for the DVD, which arrives on April 29th. If you haven't seen it yet be sure to rent, its great!",1046736000,3,745,4.405797101449275

How many rom-coms are out there (especially at present)? Too many.
What new material/angle does Two Weeks Notice offer? None.
There really is no point in this movie. It was only made because the public still go to see the same predictable rubbish over and over and therefor would more than likely make a profit.
Every single rom-com clich you can think of is in this movie: The High Flying Businessman, the lowly and accident-prone but clever pretty girl, the snaky but attractive woman introduced halfway-thru who may become a threat to the clever pretty girl, the 'world is a safe place' backdrop, the ratty ex-wife, women who cry at the mere mention (or even suggestion) of the word 'love' and a general sense of security in KNOWING how the movie will end.
It's not even a slick looking film from a directing point of view. The photography is muddy, grey and unattractive, the production design is muted to the point of invisibility and the whole enterprise just feels so...pedestrian.
The only people I could recommend this to are those who have never seen Hugh Grant play a dashing English gent or Sandra Bullock play an unlucky in love (how?) but strong-minded heroine. Unfortunately that only adds up to about 4 people and those who have been in comas for the past decade.
Even the poster is even more basic than usual. EVERY rom-com in existence has the man and woman only on a white background. How imaginative! Only this time it just looks plainer. Much like the film.",1045094400,4,1580,4.707581227436823

The story is simple, Bullock plays Lucy Kelson, a Harvard graduated lawyer who spends most of her time fightinf lost causes.  She is determined to save a Community Center that has stood in her childhood neighborhood for generations.  Enter George Wade, Grant, the tycoon whose company is planning on buildinga high rise condo community where the center stands.  He is need of a lawyer who can actually think while chewing gum (he's a bit of a womanizer, and his brother tells him to hire a woman with substance.)  In order to get her to work for him, he promises to save the community center and build around it.  Her new job turns into more of a personal assistant than Chief Attorney, as she has to help him pick stationary and clothes.  The line is crossed however when George calls Lucy out of her best friends wedding to help him pick out a suit.  In frusturation, she turns in her resignation and gives him two weeks notice.  He convinces her to stay long enough to hire and train a replacement.  The replacement comes in the form of red head vixen, June, played by Alicia Witt.  June moves in quickly, using her charms and her looks to get in the bosses..  um good graces.  Lucy realizes too late that she has feelings for George, and thinks she has lost him to June.  What happens next is what makes romantic comedy so much fun to watch.

Bullock stars as Lucy Kelson an ardent environmentalist who turned consultant for millionaire George Wade (Hugh Grant) on the condition that he preserves her community centre. The job soon proves arduous as Wade over-relies on her and she gives her two week notice, only to find herself falling in love with Wade. First-time director Marc Lawrence prudently sits back and lets the hearty comedian Bullock do her pratfalling while Hugh Grant charms effortlessly with his cavalier quips.

1854931,5,B00008NRI7,"I always love Sandra Bullock, even when I dislike her movies, and I enjoy Hugh Grant, and fortunately have disliked very, very few of his films.  This is by far one of my favorite Sandra Bullock comedies, perhaps the one I have most enjoyed since WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING.  I saw this immediately after seeing MAID IN MANHATTAN, and the two have a great deal in common.  Most importantly, both are romantic formula films, and I can't imagine anyone seeing either would harbor any doubts whatsoever about how each will end.  So, the question for a film like either of these is not how it is going to end, but the kind of trip it takes you on in getting to the preestablished destination.  I found the trip in TWO WEEKS NOTICE to be an utterly delightful one.
The key to a formula film is getting the viewers to like the main characters, and more than that, liking the idea of the two of them together.  I found both Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant's characters to be immensely likeable, and I enjoyed the chemistry the two had together, even before they realized they were romantically inclined towards one another.  If the film had a flaw, it was that we didn't get enough semi-romantic scenes before the last half hour of the movie.  Still, apart from one thing, I found the movie to be utterly delightful as a whole.  Not a masterpiece, but a heck of a lot of fun.  My one real gripe was a major bathroom scene.  Has potty humor ever improved a movie?  More to the point, has potty humor ever not harmed a film?  This was a major false note in an otherwise fun film.  I think anyone in the mood to see a pleasant romantic comedy will find this to be a thoroughly enjoyable film.",1043193600,3,1677,4.385113268608414

You know going in to the movie what to expect, for the two of them will battle yet fall in love. But I liked this movie a lot more than I thought I was going to, for the screenplay is given moments of true inspiration.
Bullock plays Lucy, a liberal-minded activist lawyer, educated at Harvard, who gets tricked into believing that she'll help her humanitarian causes by becoming assistant to Grant's George, a self-centered mogul with money but no ethics. He mainly hires her so that he can, at first, compromise all of her beliefs while, at the same time, annoying his family, who don't like women lawyers for some unexplained reason.
But, as they interact, George finds that all Lucy's quirks, difficulties and opinionated stances make her sorta charming and invaluable to him. He finds over time that he cannot make a decision without her, which leads her to give her resignation.
So George has two weeks to make Lucy stay, and she has two weeks to determine whether she really wants to go ... or if she kind of likes being under someone's confidante.
And that's when the actors' chemistry starts to work for them. The plot, though obviously formulaic, does manage SOME rare moments of ingenuity, particularly in the characterization of Lucy's brilliant, activist mother, played very well by veteran character actress Dana Ivey.
It's not a gem of a movie, but it's not a complete dud. Still, after Grant's great work in ""About a Boy,"" it's a shame he had to do something so trite.",1043107200,5,1599,4.797101449275362

Although it would have been better than any J-lo movie, it would not have been half as good as it was. Hugh Grant has an amazing gift that lets him make anyone laugh; maybe it's his sarcasm and his perverted sense of humor; or maybe it's his British accent.

The days of Cary Grant, Marilyn Monroe, Katherine Hepburn, Carole Lombard, etc are long gone. Once in a while though, moviemakers come up with a good one and ""Two Weeks Notice"" is one of them: substantially helped along with the Charisma, Charm and talent of Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant.
Even though I was a fan of Bullock's ""Murder One,"" most want to see her only in these light comedies as in her hit last year with ""Miss Congeniality.""  And Bullock has the business-savvy and intelligence to hire the best writers and directors as in Marc Lawrence here.
The story of ""Two Weeks Notice"" is a trifle: filled with witty repartee between Grant and Bullock and involving a love/hate relationship standard in this type of genre film. With so many of last year's films turning out so deadly serious, this is a relief and a palliative to all that earnestness. Ditto with J-Lo's ""Maid in Manhattan.""
""Two Weeks Notice will provide you with an hour-and-a-half of smart, funny dialogue performed by two of the best practitioners of this difficult art.

1854936,4,B00008NRI7,"Starring Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant you know this one will be good...
Another romantic comedy set once again in New York (apparently the town where all the action is), Bullock and Grant take their stab at the ever-so-popular romantic comedy to good results.
THE STORY:
Lucy Kelson (Bullock) is an activist/environmentalist/all-around defender of the little guy lawyer who takes a job as the corporate attorney for billionaire playboy/nice-guy-but unintentional capitalist pig George Wade as an attempt to save the community center that is condemned in favor of a development project by Wade's huge conglomerate.  Naturally on opposite sides of the fence at first, as the year goes by both Lucy and George slowly find themselves becoming interdependent on one another for everything as the sparks slowly but surely start to fly between them.
THE ANALYSIS:
This is NOT your connect-the-dots type of love story which really appeals to me (being a connoisseur of the genre).  Yes of course you know how the movie ends and yes some of the inevitable plot twists occur but it's the little things that set it apart that make this movie stand out from others in the genre.  Bullock's rival for George is actually a pretty decent gal and not the stereotypical you-know-what.  Plus, the ""little things"" that occur during George and Lucy's relationship as it develops are actually well played out.  One scene that stands out in my mind is the little ""lunch business meeting"" the two had which was strictly business and professional but well played out as to give that ""they're gonna hook up"" vibe.  Overall you should come out of this movie pleased.
BEST SCENES:
1. Stuck in the bathroom
2. ""Gotta go and it's rush hour""/trailor home
3. The aforementioned lunch business meeting
4. Extreme Tennis
5. Chinese take out
VERDICT:
Overall, you'll get a nice kick out of Grant and Bullock's take on the romantic comedy.  This movie of course works best for couples on a date or the younger crowds looking for a flick to spend the night or weekend away on.  You should come out of this saying, ""that was cute"" or ""that was a good one.""  Besides, it's Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant so you know it's good.

The movie works because the two stars have good chemistry and play off each other well. The ending is a foregone conclusion, but it's entertaining to see how these two get there.
What's a little scary is to see that Alicia Witt, a talented young actress and gifted pianist (remember Cybil's sardonic, red-haired daughter on her last TV series?) has gone the route of too many Hollywood actresses and looks, in this movie, alarmingly thin. When you're so acutely aware of the bones in a performer's chest that you scarcely notice her performance, something's very wrong.
This is a pleasantly entertaining movie; nothing challenging. Some good laughs and good performances elevate this one to above average.

Then why did I see this?  Well, I had nothing better to do, and my sister and her friend were going.  I figured ""What the heck?""  Now imagine my surprise....
I thought that Sandra Bullock was utterly believable in her role.  She was also passionate and witty (although, let's forget about the moments of her ""eating problem"", as it is not believable at all that she would be so thin if she ate that much in real life).
I havn't seen many movies with Hugh Grant, so as someone ""new"" to reviewing movies, I can't really compare his other roles to this one.  However I can say the only times I laughed during the movie where when he said something.  Bullock was good humor-wise, but I believe that Grant was the heart of the movie in that regard.
What I enjoyed most about this movie (and what set it apart from other romantic comedies that I have seen)was that it didn't give in to society's pressures and gender roles on women.  In the movie, Bullock actually told a prostitute to go home and finish her education, so she could be all she could be.  Now that is something positive to say about movies in this type of genre, where the woman's sole trait is almost always her beauty.  I don't mean to sound like a devout femminist, because I am definitely not.  It's just nice to see a positive influence on females where women generally try to find role models, the movies.

While the other side of the coin, there is the rich millionaire played by Hugh Grant (Nine Months, Notting Hill) was a more outgoing, non-caring and flamboyant wisp that almost didn't match to well with Sandra.

Sandra's character is funny, though at times you can still find traces of the cop she played in Miss Congeniality (which is something she needs to pay attention to). Hugh Grant is surprisingly fit for the character as a nasty and self-centred boss, who finally realised what he needs is a bossy women to whom he could relied on. His lines were delivered with wit.

Grant plays the same adorable, eyelash-fluttering character he always plays. He's very convincing as the oft-married spoiled brat who can't commit to anyone, even if he is noticeably getting older. Bullock never convinced me she was a Harvard grad or a lawyer. She seems to equate lack of make-up and scowling with liberalism and environmentalism, and generally looks unattractive and angry most of the time.

The problem with this film is that neither George or Lucy change during the story. At the end, George is still immature and shallow and Lucy is still more interested in causes than relationships.

No serious message, no real surprise twists and turns; but despite being totally formulaic it was a traet and we and the rest of the audience were often laughing out loud.
Sandra Bullock is Lucy, a dedicated environmental lawyer following in the ""do good save the world"" footsteps of her parents. Hugh Grant is the rich shallow playboy developer whose project she wants to halt. He shocks her by offering to hire her; they strike a deal to save her beloved Coney Island neighborhood center from the wrecker's ball in return for her becoming his counsel. Of course, she soon becomes his indispensable aide, eventually becomes disillusioned, and gives her TWO WEEKS NOTICE. Her relacement invokes jealousy in Lucy, the community center is about to be demolished due to George's brother's (and partner) efforts to make their project profitable after cost overruns, and Lucy heads back to her former life in her parent's cramped apartment.
Of course, what the moviegoers have always known is by now dawning on George and Lucy. Namely, they may be as different as day and night but will be miserable without each other. And, so, in the tradition of such feel good films, George overwhelms Lucy with the grand romantic gesture and after some initial confusion and ambilavence she eventually overcomes her doubts and recognizes her true feelings for him.
The pace is right, the jokes mostly work, and the supporting cast is more than adequate. So, go see this when you are in the mood for fun rather than adventure, drama, tension, action or deep meaning. It is about on par from the usual work of Bullock and Grant, but if you are a dedicated fan of either don't expect it to measure up to their best work; the material just isn't stong enough.",1041206400,37,1924,4.729166666666667

1854952,4,B00008NRI7,"Cute movie, but once again Hugh Grant plays the rich guy determined never to get married, smiling, smirking his way thru this film and full of charm.  Sandra Bullock is the girl next door, who cleans up strikingly well.  There are some skyline scenes of NY that make you want to be there too.  Good music.",1041120000,,305,4.410714285714286

Also, even though I liked this movie, I was never emotionally tied to the characters.  This movie is from 2002 and Trump has a bit part.  It's tempting to take off points for that, but I didn't.",1522627200,,364,4.294117647058823
