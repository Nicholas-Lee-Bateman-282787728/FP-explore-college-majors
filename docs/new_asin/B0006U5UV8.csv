As the other reviewer stated the remastering of the films is very low quality, if they bothered at all (some of the movies jumped around so much they were unwatchable).  The second DVD will not play on our player and the third DVD is a movie called ""Dumber than Dirt"".  I guess I was too for shelling out the money I did for these movies.  AMC and Genius Entertainment are a big disappointment.",1245542400,,427,4.3125
8043255,2,B0006U5UV8,"If this is a ""digital remaster,"" it is a digital remaster of a vastly inferior copy of the film.  I just received the set today (five months after ordering it) and have only viewed ""Angel and the Badman"" (which is the main reason i purchased the set).  The video is quite shaky (looks like someone was holding a hand held camera to copy this dvd)!  The DVD set also claims to be ""sound enhanced""  Don't believe that either.  The sound is extremely muffled.  The old VCR tape i have of this film is quite superior.

I am extremely disappointed that American Movie Classics (which claims to seek to preserve the classics) would put out such an inferior copy!  I certainly hope that the Wayne Estate puts out an offical copy of the film (and certainly hope there's a better original print out there somewhere to make a better DVD release)!",1120694400,7,836,4.526666666666666
