4261249,5,B0044M2OS6,"My teenage daughter and I first saw this movie at a screening. Now we own the dvd and have given it to friends and family. It is worth watching more than one time as there is much to be gained from viewing it. The first time we saw it we immediately loved it and appreciated the title. The movie is such a good reminder that we all do share our humanity and, in that, we are united. The movie is so well-made and the stories in it are so touching. The commentary is so interesting that it's nearly as good as the movie itself! Keep your eyes open for Grassroots Films because we can expect more quality workmanship from them in the future!",1299110400,10,639,4.203252032520325
4261250,5,B0044M2OS6,"The screening for this movie was held at my school this past year, and I have to say that it was absolutely phenomenal. The footage is so deep and real that it holds the potential to change the life of any viewer forever, as corny as that may sound. Seeing the good things that we often take advantage of and watching the horrors that happen around us that we are completely unaware of was shocking. The Human Experience is undoubtedly both a tear-jerker and an eye-opening experience. I would highly recommend that anyone and everyone should see this movie at one point in their lifetime. It will change your outlook on life dramatically, I guarantee it!",1293408000,31,655,4.655172413793103
4261251,5,B0044M2OS6,An excellent and moving documentary that does a fantastic job of capturing the human experience.

I love my students but their way of thinking can be so fixed and it is hard sometimes to get them to view the world differently.  We read the book ""The Alchemist"" and I wanted an activity that would parallel the story in some ways.  This documentary not only did that, but it engaged my students and generated thoughtful discussion.  When it would come time for the end of the period, they asked each day if we could watch just a few more minutes.  Thank you to the Azize brothers for providing such a rich experience for both me and my students.  I highly recommend watching this if you need to be uplifted, have your perspective challenged, or just be reminded as to what it really means to be human.",1463097600,,751,4.366906474820144

4261319,2,B0044M2OS6,"Wow. This movie was considerably more disappointing than I expected. This was part travelogue , part therapy movie, part vanity piece. The production values were actually *very* good - the film work, editing, the music and the montages were first rate. Technically excellent.

But the approach to the subject matter was like an overly wrought film school offering conceived over some beers.  The young adults filmed themselves for a good part of it, including reaction shots and them explaining what they were doing to other people (on camera). It was cold to be homeless! It's fun to surf in Peru! Handicapped kids are amazing! The most egregious part was when they went to Africa to meet lepers in a leper colony. They spent an inordinate part of the time grinning and making comments on being in Africa (including talking about cute girls and sunglasses at a layover). Wow, there are big bugs in Africa! I can buy machetes! Even the attempt to talk to a woman with AIDS was mostly a shot of their earnest reaction as to what she would tell her children. And then when they go to the colony, the footage starts with ominous music coupled with gratuitous close up shots of the various body parts. Very little attempt was made to humanize them to get to know their stories (as opposed to the cute kids in Peru).

The best part of this movie are the various snippets of quotes from religious and thought leaders. That's why it gets two stars. Otherwise, this movie is a mess. There might be some value here to young children/teenagers, but if you're even a moderately informed person about the world this movie will fall flat. It's a very shallow slice of life with little to offer in the way of anything insightful or interesting to say about the human experience. It's too bad, because film has the power to transcend and in different hands this could have been something.",1442188800,2,1873,4.686930091185411

It truly touches the essence of life.  I shared the video with our youth at church and it sparked some amazing conversation.  I hope these young writers and film makers do not stop with this video, but go on to make more of similar journeys.  The world is so full of pain and sorrow, this video brings back the spark of hope, joy and love.  Great work.

I have been on several volunteer trips outside of my home state and people always ask me why I don't do anything here (which I do, but some like to assume otherwise), it's always been a challenge to explain why it's a good idea to leave your comfort zone in order to understand your personal surroundings even more so that you could do more good. This movie is a great way to explain that.

4261341,4,B0044M2OS6,"I used this for teens in a high school religion class in a Catholic school.  As such it was successful and likely worth using again.  I always need to balance the time a full length film likes this takes and I think this could easily be edited into a shorter length and accomplish the same message.  I agree with other reviews who complained about the extensive ""travelogue"" scenes where less might have been more.  Effective for young teens as the characters experiencing ""The Human Experience"" seem only a year (or two!) older than my group.  However, an older group (even college and likely upperclassmen in High school) will see through some of the ""heart-string pulling"" maneuvers used by the filmmakers that my youngsters seem to miss.  The message was very appropriate: we are all one human family,each and every life is valuable and meaningful.  This video was much more effective from that point of view than some of the traditionally ""religious"" material I have at my disposal.  The teens loved it more than I did!

4261347,2,B0044M2OS6,"For such a grand title this film falls well short of answering any far reaching ""meaning of life"" type questions and is limited to some isolated experiences by two well meaning brothers of what amounts to three interesting field trips. They set out to feel what it means to be homeless in New York, then visit orphans in Peru, and finally a leper colony in Ghana. In spite of their well meaning and seemingly good intentions to highlight the plights of these particular groups, they can't possibly ""experience"" the despair and hopelessness that any of these lower strata of society go through, as the brothers know they are just passing through and not consigned to any these lifelong assignments. The viewer is merely left saying over and over to themselves, ""Wow, glad that's not me, I'm pretty lucky not to have drawn that straw in life."" But that being said, of the three groups, the orphans in Peru and the lepers did show that in spit of being dealt a very bad hand in life, their spirit was able to overcome adversity and still find happiness in just being alive, in spite of the lack of health or wealth. Overall though was a sad story of the predicaments of some of our unfortunate fellow human beings and hardly captured anything close to a percentage point of the range of the ""human experience.""",1381795200,8,1307,4.637931034482759

4261365,5,B0044M2OS6,"The award wining, independent documentary, ""The Human Experience"" by Clifford Azize, Jeffery Azize, Michael Campo, and Matthew Sanchez is a must see for the entire family. I had ordered a copy from Netflix on the basis of recommendation but with no knowledge about the film or its origins. I found it inspiring, fascinating, captivating, and rewarding. I plan to share this with my children and grandchildren as well as with a ministry I co-lead for those who are in-transition.

""The Human Experience"" follows a group of young men (Azize brothers, Campo, and Sanchez) who meet at a half-way house in New York City and then travel around the world in search of answers to life's big questions - Why am I here? What is life? What is the meaning of it all? Their first foray takes them into the streets of NYC during the coldest week of the year to live with the homeless. They interview the homeless - ""I am grateful, despite being homeless, for life.""

Their next adventure takes them to Peru, as part of a surfing club focused on charitable acts, where they work with orphans (many abandoned by their parents) and disabled children.  And finally, they travel to Africa to work with abandoned lepers in the forests of Ghana.

What is learned changes the young men forever. The human spirit, the appreciation for the gift of life, and the search for meaning are universal, regardless of circumstance. We are all connected, no matter our condition or status in life, by the bond of simply being human. This film also challenges the thought that some lives are not worth living (disabled and diseased) and that those who are aborted did not deserve the life that was given to them.",1334361600,35,1678,4.736301369863014
4261366,5,B0044M2OS6,"I recently watched this with my teenaged son.  We were both so overwhelmed with the beauty and messages throughout.  Those who perceive this movie as narcissistic or merely the Western view of the rest of the world, I believe, miss the whole point.  The movie is called The Human Experience, right?  These young men were taking their own human experiences (those of young men, from broken homes, lower socioeconomic status, abandoned in our ""land of plenty"")  and connecting them with those of others in other parts of our world.  And let me just add, that it certainly gave a much more genuine view of the world and human experiences than ""Eat, Pray, Love"" ever did. Oh my - was that blasphemous?

How many of us in our privileged existence open ourselves up to understanding not only about the ""whats"" in the world around us, but also the ""whos""?  These young men (and let's face it, sometimes we tend to give young guys a bad rap overall) stepped out on this path of discovery.  It takes courage to do this.  I don't care that some may have thought the camera angles were screwy (they weren't), the delivery was considered dull or inarticulate (it wasn't), or the commentators were supposedly serving up platters full of platitudes (they weren't). It made a positive impact. But that's just from my lens in which I view the world.

4261369,2,B0044M2OS6,"Exploitation of human suffering??? This documentary overall was very poorly made. They could have taken this to a much more deeper level and created greater emotional connection to the issues that these guys were encountering, but the film came from a selfish perspective. A more proper title would have been, ""I haven't travelled much in my American life, now guess what I found!"" It assumes that the audiences that will see this film are somewhat ignorant to world issues and have no idea what COMPASSION means. It's as if they're pointing fingers to say, ""See! I told you! We're living the wrong way!"".... and this attitude really takes away from the film.",1323820800,6,659,4.892857142857143

What I got was beautiful cinematography, incredible characters, some genuinely heart felt sentiments and sage quotes......and two blokes in the middle of it who just shouldn't have been on screen. Had the movie been limited to the former parts, it would have been stunning. It had the potential to be a Koyaanisqatsi for a new generation. But the surf nonsense, the two Jackass Lite kids travelling the world and attempting to come out with deep quotes (and I say attempting), and then failing to get across any of their experiences, in a way the other people on the film manage so well, just drags the whole affair down too much. It's worth watching, but I'm not sure where the 30 awards came from. It's just not THAT good.",1309305600,9,828,4.601351351351352
4261375,5,B0044M2OS6,"This documentary follows the travels of a group of young men from Brooklyn who sought to better understand what defines the human experience.  They started their journey in New York where they lived in a homeless community during the coldest week of the year.  Next, they traveled to Peru where they assisted hospitalized children with special medical needs.  Finally, they ventured out of their comfort zone to befriend men and women with HIV/AIDS and patients in a leper colony in Ghana.
Everything in this film was true, and the filmmakers really let the beauty of life shine forth, especially by showing their own lives in such a vulnerable way.  This story was truly inspirational and reminds us that, no matter how different people may be in culture, religion, or background, they are all human and deserve the love of others.  Additionally, the score for this film was excellently suited for the content and really made the experience even more rich.  I highly recommend this film!",1306022400,6,988,4.957575757575758

Other than that this was crap. Let's all follow the well groomed backstreet boys as they wonder around the planet. I am not sure if you could hand pick two more worse examples of humans to lead us on this journey. This bordered on exploitation at points. They spent equal time showing footage that could have been meaningful intertwined with them surfing, posing, and crying about there Mommy's when there was actual real suffering going on in the background. Pathetic. My favorite quote - ""My second grade teacher said I wouldn't amount to anything - hey check this out lady I am in Ghana - how do you like me now?"" The perfect example of the Arrogance Experience that these two complete jerks troll throughout this whole ""documentary"".

4261378,5,B0044M2OS6,"I watched this movie without much idea what it was about. My initial interest was rooted in a shallow curiosity based on an indie band/ambient music favorite of mine (hammock) having 4 songs in the soundtrack. Beyond that I had no expectations other than it is a documentary and supposed to be uplifting. From the beginning I was hooked.

We meet two adult brothers who live in a ""halfway house"". There is never much detail as to why they live there but it doesn't matter. We watch them interact and it's obvious they are close, have each other,  and are close with some others at the house. A family of sorts and this seems to have become pretty comfortable to them. Then they set out to see what is beyond that. To really be involved and not look at things on the surface as they pass by.

They live with the homeless on the streets of New York City and it doesn't appear as if they cheat even a little. They have decided if they are going to do this, they will do it right. Those who live on the streets offer them information to survive in the cold of winter. The older brother doesn't seem as sold on the idea of doing this as the younger as their initial outlooks could hardly be more opposite but they go through with it supporting each other. Some very insightful moments come from talking with the folks who actually live on the streets and won't be going back home after two weeks. I especially recall the comments made by a woman who makes a comparison of the homeless to lost dogs.

From there they move on to visit an orphanage in Peru. We watch as homeless children, many with quite severe birth defects undergo physical therapy, play, grow as a ""family"". This is especially touching simply by the fact that they are children but the film makers don't milk that fact or even try to make it especially romantic. All things are shown as they are and there are wonderful growth moments and insights.

Two more residents of the halfway house join in the journey as they travel to Ghana and come face to face with the devastated AIDS population and then people who are banished to a leper colony. Again, some devestating moments that are countered with hope and joy.

The film is interspersed with commentary by various people that offer some insight and hope, but often the deepest insight is in what is not said, though there are some very quoteable moments. Throughout it's apparent that the men in this film recieved as much if not more than what they were giving. There is a sense of humor throughout much of the film seen mostly in the interactions of the brothers and between the brothers and people they visit. When they finally head back to NYC you pretty much know what the final experience of the film is going to be but knowing doesn't detract from the impact.

I found it inspiring, caring, insightful, encouraging, and full of joy. I appreciated the fact that politics, left/right/or somewhere in between, played NO part of this film. It is simply about being human and treating others as if they are too. I fully intend to show this film to the small group of abuse/neglect teen age boys I work with. It does have a great soundtrack too, by the way. Hammock's 4 songs are great AND the added bonus of a couple of Innocence Mission songs. Although it gets a PG-13 rating, I'm surprised as it really doesn't seem more than PG material though I think the concepts may be a little too advanced for many children under 12. In those terms, apart from a few bits of language, the rating makes sense. I strongly encourage folks to see this film and decide for yourself if it's something you would want to share with others. I was surprised by the subtle but deep impact it made on me.",1303776000,37,3700,4.464497041420119
4261379,5,B0044M2OS6,"THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE is exactly what it says it is. It is a film, but it succeeds in highlighting the broadness, the differences, and ultimately the universality of the human experience. From its moving but cryptic cover image to its all-encompassing title, potential viewers may be at a small loss as to what the film actually will be. But the film, the plot's journey and the actual journey the filmmakers had to make in order to see their film finally completed, represents perfectly what the human experience really is. Why are we here, what are we supposed to do as ""human beings"", and is there something that unites us all? Rather than preaching specific answers, the film explores these questions with the viewer, taking one and all on a journey of discovery, across the world, and across the human experience.

Brothers Jeffrey Azize and his friends leave their halfway house in Brooklyn for a journey to unknown destinations. Not sure of exactly what they were going to do, the brothers seek out adventures and people to help them on their journey to find answers to life's toughest questions. Their travels take them physically to the streets of New York, the mountains of Peru, and finally to the leper colonies of Ghana. But their travels take them much farther than these places, for the people they meet along the way and the adventures that they  share with their viewers are ones not easily forgotten. Rated PG-13, it contains some disturbing images throughout, but for the right audiences, this film is a must-see. Thought-provoking and inspiring, the brothers' journey is one we would all like to take.

The film makes no bold claims that it holds all the answers life's toughest questions; the filmmakers seek no encompassing indoctrination. The Human Experience began as a humble question and has become a thought-provoking journey and a fantastic film.",1303084800,8,1873,4.95859872611465

Few films take such an in depth look into what it means to be human, what drives us to go on and what our lives should involve and be about. Whomever you are and wherever you are from, this film will touch your heart with the beautiful glimpse it provides into the human family. What struck me the most was essentially how similar each person is, and how at the core of the human heart is this desire to love and be loved, to have life and life to the full.
