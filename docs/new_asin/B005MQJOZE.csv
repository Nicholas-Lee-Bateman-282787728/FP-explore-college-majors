4835010,5,B005MQJOZE,"Right off the bat, let me say that this is a recording of an event, rather than an eventful recording. I must say that the Mahler 2 is an inspired choice for this occasion,marking as it does the tenth anniversary of that awful day in 2001.

The main thought that I was left with was how affected I was with the reaction to this wonderful music by the outside audience. Talk about rapt attention. These people were transfixed, and frequently with tears rolling down their cheeks during the most moving moments. Initially I was bothered by the low-level ""street noise"" I could discern during the outside shots, but this soon melted away with the emotion of it all. Just think how many of the outside (and inside) audience members heard this life-changing music for the first time that night! How many will become new Mahler devotees? I remember when I first heard Mahler's music and it changed my life forever - and that was nearly 50 years ago.

Now to the performance, which was very good but not transcendent. This cannot be your sole Mahler 2 on video, because of the outside distractions and relatively neutral run-through. Abbado, Chailly and Boulez all have more incisive versions on Bluray, all with indispensible individual insights. Gilbert is not a seasoned Mahlerian, but he has the potential to become one and he does use rubato and portamento to good effect. The NY Phil. are very good with special kudos to the woodwinds for their phrasing and articulation. There are a couple of untidy string moments.  All the other versions have better singers than this pair. DeYoung is too theatrical and her voice is not the good rich ""honey-toned"" mezzo needed for this music (in the  Urlicht movement). I found soprano Roschmann too reedy . My favorite duo is in the Abbado set (Larsson and Gvazava - talk about pure voices). Roschmann also does not ""rise"" above the choir as smoothly as she should in the finale, as do the sopranos in the Boulez and Abbado versions).

All in all,though, the overall performance was better than I expected. Bernstein used to say that you had to be a really bad conductor to screw up Mahler because the composer left no detail to chance in the score.(This theory has been disproved in more than a few vacuous audio recordings, but happily, no bad video versions).

The sound and video on Bluray are impeccable, using DTS Master Audio and 1080p. The interviews are boilerplate, but inoffensive. Gilbert's intro talk is moving and memorable.

If you have any or all of the other recordings on video, you should get this for the sense of occasion. If not, get one of the others first, for a purer concert experience. Personally, I have never been able to listen to the Urlicht or the last half of the finale in any version without involuntary tears streaming down my face. More people need to have their emotional depths plumbed by this exquisite music. The world would be a much better place!",1322179200,13,2927,4.727450980392157
4835011,5,B005MQJOZE,"All of a sudden, in this centennial year of the death of Mahler, there are now four Mahler Seconds on Blu-Ray.
ABBADO's Lucerne performance of 19/20 August 2003 was the first to appear on Blu-Ray.  There was a sound problem with the initial release, but it has been fixed.  My copy forms part of the boxed set of the first seven symphonies, where the First and the Second are combined onto one disc, the Third and Fourth on another, the Fifth and Sixth on another, while the Seventh is sole occupant of another disc.  It is wonderful to have all the Mahler symphonies out on Blu-ray already so early in the life of the format, and the bulk of them presented by Abbado's handpicked Lucerne players.  The contributions of Berlin veterans like clarinettist Sabine Meyer and flautist Emmanuel Pahud are highlighted in the Second, and their presence is missed in the First, which was recorded later.  The blu-ray sound of the Second is astonishingly better than on the prior DVD release, and reveals one of the greatest performances of this work in our time.  The performance and the disc are so perfect that it would have seemed like hubris to attempt another release.  Yet three fine competitors have surfaced almost simultaneously.
CHAILLY's Leipzig performance of 17/18 May 2011 formed part of the first annual International Mahler Festival, along with a performance of Mahler's Eighth.  The two symphonies both require large choral and orchestral forces, so there was practical advantage to having them both while the participants were available.  The chorus masters Howard Arman, Simon Halsey and Gregor Meyer were certainly busy with rehearsals leading up to the festival, as the results testify.  Ten years before, Chailly produced another outstanding high-resolution audio recording of this symphony, with the Concertgebouw; it was released both as a DVD-Audio disc and in a CD boxed set with the rest of the symphonic cycle.
GILBERT's New York performance of 10 September 2011 took place on the vigil of tenth anniversary of the terrorist attacks.  In addition to the capacity crowd of 2646 people inside Avery Fisher Hall, a large screen outside in Lincoln Center Plaza accommodates a larger crowd, among whom are family members of the fallen.  The conductor gives an impassioned introductory speech which has many audience members in tears, along with yours truly.  In some ways the speech upstages the performance of the symphony.  At least it highlights the tragic and courageous aspects of the score, as opposed to the light touches, which are manifold.  The performance certainly has a sense of occasion, and the choice of piece is particularly appropriate in view of the fact that Mahler himself conducted this orchestra in this piece on 8 December 1908.
BOULEZ's Berlin performance of 26/27 March 2005 makes a somewhat belated appearance on Blu-ray, after already having incarnations on DVD and HD-DVD.  There is no way to compare with the latter, but the Blu-ray sound is a big, big leap from the DVD, which sounded anemic in both LPCM stereo and DTS.  The LPCM stereo on the blu-ray sounds vastly better than the corresponding stereo on the DVD.  To my ears the multi-channel sound on the Blu-ray is too bass-heavy (one of the microphone set-ups must have been near the basses), but others may prefer it.  The occasion for this performance was the 80th birthday of the conductor, but unmentioned in the program notes is the fact that it was also near the 110th anniversary of the work's premiere, which took place right there in Berlin.  So the Berliners conscientiously step into this piece as heirs to those who created it.
Of course the entire Abbado set is a must for the Mahler fan, but the other three performances of the Second are so fine that they too rise to the level of the indispensable.",1322092800,8,3815,4.921996879875195
4835012,4,B005MQJOZE,"""In Remembrance and Renewal"" of the tenth anniversary of 9/11 the New York Philharmonic under Alan Gilbert and with soloists Dorothea Rschmann and Michelle DeYoung as well as the New York Choral Artists fittingly performed Mahler's ""Resurrection Symphony"", recorded live in Avery Fisher Hall in brilliant audio and video (bravo Accentus!).  I am not altogether happy with the filming: the camera takes us outside at times, to the listeners on the plaza at Lincoln Center, annoyingly to the large TV projection screen on which the concert is shown, and there are both panorama and street shots (the latter once even in rapid motion!), but these distractions from the musical event apparently are meant to convey a ""village"" atmosphere for this ""Concert for New York"". Now to the performance. Alan Gilbert has a firm grasp on the score's many emotional layers ranging from initial severe grandeur through the second movement's dance-like charm, the scherzo's whimsical playfulness, the reverential beauty of ""Urlicht"" to the apocalyptic outbursts of the finale and the final apotheosis which, in lesser hands, can come close to empty bombast. There are places in the finale where he slows down too much for emphasis or effect, and the tempo seems to drag. Despite some minor glitches in intonation and ensemble, he brings off a fine performance, a performance, though, that does not shed any new light on the piece.  This makes him a good Mahlerian, but not a great one.

Competition is stiff in the Second on DVD. In addition to Boulez, the recent Chailly is one of my all-time favorites. Both find many fresh insights in the score, in detail as well as in structural cohesion and by highlighting important motifs. Alas, Gilbert is not quite in the same league. His soloists, fine as they may be, don't quite measure up to Mahler's idiom: mezzo DeYoung is too operatic and theatrical for her part, soprano Rschmann fares better, but ultimately lacks the ""Mahler flair"" we admire in others since the days of Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. The bonus talks by Gilbert and General Manager Zarin Mehta (Zubin's brother) are appropriate for the occasion but basically noncommittal. All in all, this is a noble enterprise indeed but not a performance to displace any other on my shelf.",1322006400,8,2269,5.029255319148936
4835013,5,B005MQJOZE,"This is a record of the most intense performance of Mahler's Resurrection symphony that I have seen on video or attended in person.  There are many very good DVD's of this work, including those by Bernstein, Abbado and Chailly.  Perhaps the reason for the sheer power of this performance is the moment it commemorates.  Everyone involved, the conductor, the player and the live audience (sitting in the Avery Fisher Hall and outside the Lincoln Center), seems to be possessed by that moment.  The concert starts with a brief address by Alan Gilbert.  Often these pre-concert speeches are ponderous or irrelavant.  The address by Mr Gilbert is a model of dignity, and brings an emotional charge that carries into the performance.  The performance itself is magnificent.  The camerawork is effective, without drawing undue attention to itself.  The quality of the image on the Blu Ray version is flawless.  The audience response at the end is overwhelming in a spontaneous way, very different from the conventional ovations we often see.
I was dismayed to see that a search on Mahler 2 on Amazon does not lead to this recording.  There is no other review of it at this time.  I hope more people see this.  Many concertgoers say the first performance of the Resurrection symphony was a life-changing experience for them.  Not all performances give us that experience.  This one does.",1321747200,6,1380,4.965065502183406

8479612,5,B005MQJOZE,"Note: This review covers only the audio portion of the concert, which can also be heard as an MP3 download.

On the tenth anniversary the Philharmonic offered the Mahler Second as a concert tribute ""In Remembrance and Renewal."" There is a dVD of the vent which was also publicly broadcast. When emotions run so deep and grief is so easily revived, the ""Resurrection"" Symphony calls for a special interpretation (in the orchestra's extensive download back catalog there is already a Mahler Second under Lorin Maazel that was very well played and recorded). Does Gilbert inspire the musicians to give an extra measure of musical feeling? Mostly I think the answer is yes.

In the first movement he begins a bit tamely, but there is a successful buildup to the great climaxes, and when the music is quiet, there is no rhythmic slackening. Gilbert has really bonded with the orchestra after a couple of tentative years, and here is the result, in highly expressive, alert playing that really blooms. Among recent Mahler Second we've gotten an incomparable live reading from Klaus Tennstedt and the London Phil, followed by anew one form the same orchestra, also impressive, under Vladimor Jurowski. This one is far better recorded than either, and the individual playing is sensational. Every episode in the first movement seemed completely engrossing, no easy thing when you've heard dozens of Mahler Seconds.

After the high drama and turbulence of the first movement, the second, in the form of an interrupted minuet, is often a throw away (the composer was right to ask for a vie-minute pause between the two movements, impractical as that is in practice). Gilbert makes something memorable of this music, with a Viennese lilt, explosive interjections, and very personal phrasing - these are things I never heard in his first two seasons. He betters all his recent rivals, even Gergiev with the London Sym., who is a master as soft, refined nuancing. Gilbert applies the same subtlety to the Scherzo, where initially I thought it was misplaced - this is satiric music at heart. but he won me over by contrasting the subtlety with highly emotional brass outbursts, and also by the extreme beauty of the playing.

Michelle DeYoung seems ubiquitous, the blond mezzo of choice for everything, but her singing here is far form generic. She's intense and moving, as is Gilbert's accompaniment. The grand payoff of the Resurrection Sym. is its final half hour, a journey of the hero's soul into Paradise. Happily, Gilbert creates a palpable sense of mystery and wonder, which is missing from Tilson Thomas's overly polished San Francisco recording and even the accomplished Haitink performance on the Chicago Symphony's in-house label. the cliche holds that American orchestras are technically skilled wile European ones are emotionally deeper. Not here - for all its jaded reputation, the Philharmonic plays wit soul, as much as it did in the Bernstein era. (A long time coming, some old hands will mutter.)

The pacing is measured but not cautious; one marvels at how well the orchestra sustains tension at any speed or dynamic. The celestial explosions of brass choirs are joyous. The level of trust between orchestra and conductor must be very high, and the degree of mutual admiration - rarely have I heard such a committed Mahler performance, certainly not in recent years. The New York Choral Artists are fine, as is soprano Dorothea Roschmann, and the arrival at apocalypse is shattering.

I'd go so far as to cal this a great Mahler Second, which cathartically honors the victims of 9/11 in its intensity and redeems the Philharmonic as the greatest of American Mahler orchestras.",1348012800,,3682,5.037766830870279
8479613,5,B005MQJOZE,"Mahler 2 is one of my favorite symphonies; this was a pleasure to see.  Great clarity of sound and picture.  New York, as always, sounds great.  If you're a snob about your recordings, you'll notice, just like every other live performance, there are a few imperfections.  But if you're not a robot and you enjoy hearing fantastic musicians play their hearts out, this is a must see!  I've watched this over and over; it still gives me goosebumps!",1344211200,2,446,4.666666666666667
8479614,5,B005MQJOZE,"Other reviewers have discussed the details of this performance - the soloists (just OK), the woodwinds (terrific), the strings (a problem now and then), &c. But I think that the occasion for this performance trumped all other considerations. The orchestra seemed utterly engrossed in the music, the chorus blended beautifully, and the soloists were, well, OK. Also, I thought some of Gilbert's tempos were too slow. But the audience, inside the hall and outside watching TV, was rapt. The cameras moved too much but it was probably a good idea to show images of the city as well as of the orchestra and the audience.

Now, was the Mahler 2nd a good choice for this occasion? I'm not sure. Perhaps Randall Thompson's Testament of Freedom to the words of Thomas Jefferson might have been more apt. Or some other American work sung in English by, say, Renee Fleming. 9/11 was after all an American event, and it seems a bit strange to choose a work by an Austrian composer sung in German by a German soprano (and also, to be sure, by an American mezzo).

As a musical experience, then, I think this performance only rates a 4. But as a commemoration of one of the most significant and traumatic events in modern American history, I think it was fine; and the Star Spangled Banner with which it began was exactly right. Sitting in our home at the edge of the Sonoran desert, a long long way from the New York in which we grew up and in which I practiced law (and sang in several choruses), we were deeply moved. So, yes, a 5.",1335225600,2,1521,4.527272727272727
