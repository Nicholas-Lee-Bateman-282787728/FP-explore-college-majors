7828151,5,6302586283,"This is a unique and soul stirring documentary that will grip you and humble you, and perhaps, change the way you think about God, poverty and racism forever. As you are drawn into the world of Father Bob Castle, a Yale-educated white rector of a small Episcopal church in Harlem, you can't help but be in awe of this extraordinary man! Yet this is not the tale of some white liberal do-gooder ""gracing"" impoverished minority neighborhoods with his help. Rather it is the story of a very human man whose hard-earned presence in the heart and soul of a mostly African-American and Latino community takes him to the drug-infested, pot-holed streets of Harlem, and it is there, among friends, where he lives with a reasonable hope for God's amazing Grace!  A very personal story of Jonathan Demme's long-lost cousin Bobby, COUSIN BOBBY is filmed like an amateur home-movie so that it allows you to experience, even if it's in a little itty bitty way, all the love, anger, faith, grief, outrage, fear, joy, remorse, pain, beauty, sadness and hope that must be part of Father Castle's world every grace-filled day.",975542400,5,1109,4.836842105263158
