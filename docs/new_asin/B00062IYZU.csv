2162786,4,B00062IYZU,"PLATINUM DISC's POPEYE THE SAILOR: 24 CLASSIC CARTOONS is a bargain-priced collection of public domain animation that's a cut above most other budget brands. With the exception of dark or faded condition on ""Out to Punch,"" ""I Don't Scare"" and Fright to the Finish,"" all these cartoon are in good to VG condition. The two-reeler, ""Aladdin And His Wonderful Lamp"" is exceptionally nice. Nine here are from FLEISCHER studos, the balance being  FAMOUS product.

This one's main limitation is its heavy paper slipcover.
