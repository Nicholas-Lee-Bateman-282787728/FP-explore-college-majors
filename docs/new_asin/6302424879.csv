460367,4,6302424879,"This is a very fine picture which follows very closely WSC's early autobiography 'My Early Years'. The book (and film) cover the years 1874 (YOB) to his first election to parliament in 1906, at age 26. I have used the film as an introduction to a 12 lecture course on this very remarkable man.",1319068800,3,293,4.444444444444445

It was sent to me by your vendor via the US Postal system and I never received it.  I went on line to find it and it was listed as undeliverable.  I contacted your vendor who made it clear to me that I had better try to trace it.  I tried, but got no where.  One of the messages indicated that it was sent to the wrong zip code.

Your vendor was of no help until I e-mailed them that they selected the vendor, I didn't, they paid the vendor, I didn't, I paid them, so it is their vendor and I expect them to find it.  I got an apology and a number that i should check with the post office to see if I can find it.

I will do no more, and I have paid for it through my credit card.  That means that I was basically swindled by either you, your vendor, the US Post office or a combination of all of of you.

460370,4,6302424879,"Winston Churchill was one of the giants of the 20th Century and a personal hero of mine, so I look forward to any coverage of his life. ""Young Winston"" is an excellent departure from the blood and guts bio pics that tell us how Churchill saved the world in the 40s, so on this point alone the film gets high marks. But beyond merely giving us so much of Churchill's story that we were not acquainted with, the film has some great performances, notably from Robert Shaw as Winston's father and Simon Ward as Young Winston.

Robert Shaw (1927-78) is known for many fine performances, from his Oscar nominated role as Henry VIII in ""A Man for All Seasons"" (1966) to his mega hits in ""From Russia with Love"" (1963), ""The Sting"" (1973) and ""Jaws"" (1975). Despite these great performances, I think his role in this film is his best performance ever.

This was Simon Ward's (1941) third film and his best. He appeared in about a dozen more films, most of them forgettable, and then retired in 1992. Ward's performance is excellent. He seems to grow into the role, and by the time the film ends, we are looking at the Winston Churchill that we came to know.

Anne Bancroft (1931-2005) appears as Winston's mother. Young Winston was only a few years following ""The Graduate"" (1966) yet Bancroft looks a decade younger. She had a distinguished career with an Oscar in 1962 for ""The Miracle Worker"" and a Golden Globe in 1964 for ""The Pumpkin Eater"" and 1967 for ""The Graduate."" Her performance in Young Winston earned her a well deserved BAFTA best actress nomination.

The film has a basket of English actors from Jack Hawkins, Anthony Hopkins, Patrick Magee, Edward Woodward, John Mills and Ian Holm. Each puts in their limited screen time and does an admirable job, but no one is on screen long enough to make much of an impression.

The film is directed by Richard Attenborough (1923). Better known for his work as an actor (""The Great Escape"", ""The Sand Pebbles"", ""Jurassic Park""), his work as a director has won him a DGA and an Oscar (""Gandhi"") and a BAFTA (""Shadowlands""). This film was his second as a director.

FWIW - Attenborough and Anthony Hopkins got along so well in this film that they made 4 more together including ""A Bridge Too Far"", ""Chaplin"", and ""Shadowlands"".

Carl Foreman (1914-84) wrote the screenplay. Foreman was nominated 6 times for an Oscar and won once (""The Bridge at the River Kwai""). He won WGA awards for ""High Noon"" (1952) and ""The Men"" (1950). Foreman also wrote ""The Guns of Navarone"" (1961) which so enchanted Churchill that he asked him to work on this film.

The top grossing films in 1972 included the terrific western ""Jeremiah Johnson"" along with ""The Godfather"", ""The Poseidon Adventure"", ""Cabaret"", ""Deliverance"", and ""The Getaway"". The big Oscar winners were ""The Godfather"" (Picture, Actor) and ""Cabaret"" (Director, Actress, Supporting Actor). Other memorable films from that year included ""The Candidate"", ""Last Tango in Paris"", ""The Ruling Class"", ""Way of the Dragon"",  and ""Pink Flamingoes"".

The film was nominated for 3 Oscars (Screenplay, Art, Costume). It won a BAFTA for Costume and was nominated for Actor (Robert Shaw), Actress (Anne Bancroft), Art (Geoffrey Drake), and Best Newcomer (Simon Ward). It won the Golden Globe as Best English Language Foreign Film and Carl Foreman won a British Writer's Guild award for the screenplay.

This film will appeal to fans of British films and biographies, and to anyone interested in the historical account of one of the 20th Century's greatest men.",1310515200,6,3541,4.855721393034826
460371,5,6302424879,"Young Winston is the story of Winston Churchill. It begins with him being sent off to school at about six, but spends much of its time with him as a young officer in the British Army. The best part to me was the episode during the Boar where he was captured and then escaped. I've been to the spot where he was captured and it was rendered very well in the movie. Indeed it was to see this event that I bought the movie and I was not dissappointed.

Although he had a craving for publicity and perhaps over stated his own abilities, he was certainly no coward.",1173830400,6,560,4.185185185185185
460372,5,6302424879,"If you want a good but ""light"" version of W.S.C. life then this is a good place to start. I just wish that someone would do say like Manchestors books on him into a film. It is one hell of a good story that needs telling more now than ever. I frankly feel that Churchill will be rated the Man of the 20th Century and a sort of Cassandra to boot. He had that much vision into the future.",1121558400,5,386,3.8987341772151898
460373,4,6302424879,"Winston Churchill's early years make for a fine movie. By all rights young Winston should have been an upper class twit or a hopeless depressive. Although born in a palace he had a childhood none of us would want. His parents were terrible as the movie plainly shows. Her father was a brilliant, complex man and is wonderfully portrayed by Robert Shaw (Quint from Jaws and Red Grant in From Russia with Love). On his good days Lord Churchill is a distant father, and a poor husband but Robert Shaw makes you care about him when he destroys his career and you pity him when his mind starts to decay.

The late Anne Bancroft plays Jenny Churchill who although one of the most beautiful and charming women in England was a somewhat negelctful mother who didn't seem to pay attention to her son until he was grown and began to pull away from her.

Then the movie goes from sad to funny to sad again. Teenaged Winston developes a brittle cocksureness that alienates quite a few people but is an effective cover and reaction to the crappy childhood he endured.

Finally, after his father's death Winston ungergoes a Henry V-esque transformation. The neglected, ""dumb"" kid becomes a soldier, briefly a POW, writer and then a politician who would eclispe everything his fahter ever did. Simon Ward does a great job of playing a Winston Churchill most of us are unfamiliar with. The costumes are great. The scenary is great. The battle scenes are disturbing. It's a worthwhile and entertaining film.",1118102400,53,1490,4.723076923076923
460374,3,6302424879,"This film is quite faithful to its source, ""My Early Life"", a partial autobiography published in 1930 when WSC's career was fully in the dumpster and he was thought to be a mere divider between the two brilliant Randolphs, his father and his son.
The book is a crackling read, full of the old umpity-oof, as P. G. Wodehouse might say.  It is particularly engaging in that every reader knows more about the brash young upstart at its center than did the middle-aged failure who wrote it.
I have given the film just three stars because of this very faithfulness.  Alas, the film is paced like a book, not a movie.  What seems dazzling in the leisurely spaces of the 367-page 1949 edition is simply leaden when put on the screen with its quite different rhythm.
By the way, WSC's father, Lord Randolph Churchill, died of syphilis, not of a tumor, as the film makes quite clear.",1070409600,4,874,4.554140127388535
460375,3,6302424879,This film starts very strongly with action in the northwest frontier of India but then spends an hour concentrating on Winston's childhood and his ailing father.  About 1 hour after the initial battle we pick up his wartime exploits again in the Boer war where there are some exciting action scenes involving a train.  Then we see the story of Winston's escape out of Boer territory and finally the last 30 minutes or so  involve his political ambitions.  If it had just concentrated on his wartime experiences it would have been great.  The battle sequences they did do appeared very realistic and accurate.  The Sudan campaign is mentioned but we don't get to see it.  So that is the reason for the title of my review.,1045008000,4,720,4.666666666666667
460376,4,6302424879,"This movie based on CHURCHILL's own memoirs about his younger days is definitely worth seeing,even if RICHARD ATTENBOROUGH has made the mistake of beleiving everything he read as the absolute truth. Like all good writers,WINSTON CHURCHILL knew how to capturate the attention of his readers by exagerating on a few topics. Still,there are priceless moments about his father who died from a debilating tumor. ROBERT SHAW gives a good performance,and so does SIMON WARD as CHURCHILL.The film ends with WINSTON giving his famous speech that will make his reputation. You can catch JANE SEYMOUR briefly and later a certain ANTHONY HOPKINS then mostly a theater actor.",1032134400,,662,5.254716981132075
460437,5,6302424879,This DVD arrived on time and in good condition.  This was not quite what I expected but most enjoyable all the same.  Lots of action and it certainly gives us an insight into the Young Winston and a glimpse of that brilliance we would rely on later in his life.,1503619200,3,261,4.2
460438,5,6302424879,A great job with a great story well presented. A very credible young Churchill,1501718400,,78,4.642857142857143
460439,5,6302424879,"Simon Ward, Anne Bancroft and Simon Ward were the right star actors for this film, ""Young Winston.""  To have a complete understanding of Winston Church as a famous Prime Minister of Great Britain, it requires a look at the formative years as a boy, adolescent and young man.  For the first time, I viewed this movie in 1972.  The English Culture has its own uniqueness.  His parents were so preoccupied with lives in Parliament and social engagements that he was sent off to Boarding School; Winston's nanny filled in as a beloved confidant.  Winston Churchill's Father lost his mental faculties while he was young and left with the responsibilities of support for his immediate family.  He was a prisoner during the Boer War and escaped.  Then he rose in fame as an astute politician in the English Parliament.  Cohesion to the movie was achieved by the voice of an older mature Winston Churchill who spoke flashback narrations through 3 main periods in the life of the ""young"" Winston Churchill.  Despite the lack of captions need for clarity in the audial speaking, it is a five-star production.",1500940800,,1098,4.860215053763441

It sticks closely to the facts, and the actors uniformly do a good job and in most cases bear a striking physical resemblance to the people they're portraying. Simon Ward in particular looks a lot like a young Churchill, and has just enough in the way of Churchillian cadences and mannerisms to be completely believable without ever lapsing into mere mimickry.
I especially like how the filmmakers refrained from adding any fictional glosses to spice things up. Churchill's exploits as a young man hardly needed any of that, after all.

460619,4,6302424879,"Simon Ward is perfectly cast as young Winston.  At the surface, he captures the voice, the mannerisms, etc. Within, he solidly depicts the hard driving, and often off putting ambition that drove this much ignored and under-loved child of an ambitious, self-destructive father and self-centered, spend-thrifty mother to overcome his deficiencies of education (no Eton, Oxford, or Cambridge) and money to rise through the talents he possessed in abundance, including death-defying courage, autodidactic learning of history and politics, and a skill with the pen rivaled among modern politicians only by Lincoln. Excellent sets and costumes. Wonderful location shooting capture Afghanistan, India, the Sudan, and London. Direction pedestrian. The music is perhaps the worst score of any historical epic.

Now that it's out on DVD, I could not be more pleased, especially since this version is not only widescreen and a very good print transfer, but also contains over 20 additional minutes of footage cut from the tape release.  The battle scenes now have greater scope and context, Malakand and Omdurman both get good treatment.  The scene of 60,000 dervishes approaching the British forces at the Nile is stunning in effect.

I did not see the theatrical release in 1972, there were 11 more minutes in that version.  Perhaps one day a director's cut can be found and released.  The subject matter could take it, I think.",1433980800,,711,4.559055118110236

Reading about the Boer War is one thing, seeing the action faithfully and lavishly  delivered by Attenborough is a more digestible experience.

The film culminates with Churchill's famous speech before the House of Commons denouncing his government's defense policy, which many believed would end his career in politics.

Simon Ward's acting is first rate even if his characterization of Churchill's speech and mannerisms was not the best on film. Moreover, the use of an off scene news correspondent conducting separate one-on-one interviews with Lord Randolph Churchill, Lady Jennie Churchhill, and Winston was helpful in providing the viewer with biographical information and historical context, but came off with the appearance of an Oprah Winfrey interview.",1413676800,2,1038,5.407407407407407

It feels as if the film's scope exceeds it's budget at times, and the entire film suffers a little for it. Wales is a poor sub for South Africa. The directing is stilted and very 'presentational' few risks are taken and the pace resembles travel in the pre-victorian era - slow and mostly painful. The VO choices are over the top, and Winstons distinct growl is an audio cartoon of itself.
That said, the film is an accurate depiction of Churchill's early years, and is painstaking researched. The locations are perfect, and the sets do justice to the era, even if they're lit like a TV stage.
The performances are uniformly excellent, and Shaw is at his best as Randolph Churchill. Worth a watch for Churchill enthusiasts and history buffs. Downton Abbey fans will likely be disappointed.",1358553600,2,862,4.71523178807947

The unique mixing of time is Attenborough stamp on the film. However, he is pretty accurate and often uses specific quotes from Churchill's book. I found the film enticing as an introduction to the time of the late 19th century (I actually showed my kids (9 and 11) the first half of the film) as well as to Churchill as a personality. I am now interested in reading more of Churchill (his early writings such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Story-of-the-Malakand-Field-Force-Dover-Military-History-Weapons-Armor/dp/0486474747/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Story of the Malakand Field Force (Dover Military History, Weapons, Armor)</a>) and to read about the times in Tuchman's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Proud-Tower-A-Portrait-of-the-World-Before-the-War-1890-1914/dp/0345405013/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Proud Tower: A Portrait of the World Before the War, 1890-1914</a>.

And for me, there is  the most curious facet of this history, as young Winston seems to choose to be a ""Great Man"" as a any other profession, as other people choose to be shoemaker , engineer or salesman. The difference is he accomplished well his aim in that rare profession I'm afraid gone forever.",1339200000,2,557,4.5049504950495045

As for me, this film is a minor masterpiece of superior directing, casting, research and production. Very accurate in all areas of Winston's life. The actors are all top notch and carry the storyline well. Simon Ward is excellent as Winnie and captures his gestures and mannerisms in such a fashion that he transforms into Churchill in some sequences. Not much is mentioned of his brother, Jack, but Winston's early military exploits are well done and accurate (I often wonder about what scenes were edited from the film that might have been really great to see). The attention to detail is superb, even the correct weaponry, the badge flashes on the soldiers sun helmets, the train sequence in the Boer War segment, the artillery used in the Sudan segment and even the RN sailor's straw hats are spot on. Well done, Mr/Sir Attenbourgh for a great and epic film that can now gain a new audience after laying in some dusty film vault for decades.

He was honored with a nomination for his work in A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS... And why he wouldn't be nominated for this film as well, is beyond me.
As for the film as a whole... One word should suffice... SLOW! It has beautiful costumes and settings are wonderful, but this film just isn't interesting. Even to a history buff, I just cannot see it!
Only, only for a historian of Winston Churchill, or Robert Shaw fan and that is it!
