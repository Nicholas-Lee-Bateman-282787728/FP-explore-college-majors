On the same token, this film is almost destined to be misunderstood and unappreciated by those looking to be entertained on surface value alone.  This story attempts to provide a real portrayal of our three principle characters.  As such, we not only get to see them warts and all, it also takes a great deal of time for the importance and meaning of many of their lines to become apparent.  So the pleasure of understanding and appreciating the deep undercurrents of this story will only be had by those willing to invest the time in studying the scenes and dialogue and then thinking back upon them after the movie is over.

On the same token, the telling of the story also makes it easy not to take that last additional step of putting yourself in each character's shoes and thinking from their point of view.  As the viewer, we have complete knowledge of each character's actions.  But the characters do not always have that luxury with each other.  It is incredibly instructive to think about things from their perspective and reflect upon how they perceive each other and why they make the decisions that they do.

Ira Sachs has created a movie that will, no doubt, have a cult following among lovers of character studies and movies about the music industry.  While little about this movie directly plays up the angle that the protagonist is a musician, his explosive personality and bad habits are synonymous with the musical megalomaniac.

Rip Torn leads the film as Memphis musician and producer Alan James.  He's the prototypical alcoholic artist with the huge ego to boot.  It would be easy to play this character by the book, but Torn subtly infuses him with life and personality.  We feel his character grappling with his mortality, helplessly trying to hold on to anything he can.  When his poor choices threaten to alienate his much younger Russian live-in girlfriend Laura, played by Dina Korzun, he is even willing to undergo a metamorphasis, real or imagined, to try to keep her.  Korzun also enfuses life into Laura with an understated delivery.  She is distant from the pain of Alan's mistreatment and short temper, yet accepting of it, well aware of how her life is materially improved by all that his money and fame provide to her and her three year old son.  She seems to love him, but the undercurrent is that she also seems to be slightly aware that she is still attractive but perhaps not as young or beautiful as she once was.

My personal favorite role in the film is that of Alan's son Michael, who is played by Darren E. Burrows.  He is an actor I was vaguely familiar with, but in his role here he really shines.  He's somewhat resentful of his father, and has clearly worked hard to try to distance himself with his own life choices.  He visits from California, where he is making a career for himself as an English teacher and, as his father says, a writer who ""gets paid by the word.""  His own an unhappy relationship and his wife's recent pregnancy provide just enough of a common thread to bond him with Laura.

A large part of this character study deals with the loneliness and alienation that each of those three deals with in their own way.  Michael's strained relationship with his father sends the signal that Alan's behavior has not always been as embracing as he attempts to appear.  Alan suffers the lonely self-created hell of feeling like nobody can relate to him and the burden of providing falls squarely on his shoulders.  And Laura feels the loneliness of having few options and being loved less than desired.

The director Ira Sachs seems to have a great eye for cinematography, and his camera staff must be top notch.  The way the characters faces are framed adds intimacy and beauty to many smokey shots.

Much has been made of the closing scene of the film.  My personal interpretation centers on rethinking all aspects of the scene from the various points of view of the different characters.  I will not spoil the story as some have done, because the devil is in the details.  If you watch closely there are a number of reasons why they chose to close the film as they did.

There is some music in the movie, though it seems like music could have been used to greater effect given the character this movie is based on.  Here we get the sense that Alan is an *important* figure in the music business, but little direct connection to the music is established.  Perhaps, that too, was done intentionally to show how Alan is alienated from his own work.  Whatever the reason, we get one scene with him hammering out some formulaic piano over a remixed dub and several of him flying off the handle due to insignificant issues at his studio.  This is the only aspect of the story I would have liked to see developed more.  We get to see Alan as a man, but not as a music man.

This is a very good movie for those who like character studies and enjoy films of an entertaining vein.  There is some good music, though not all of it is good.  And the shooting is done beautifully and effectively.  Give this film a chance, and do not hesitate to add it to your collection if you are a lover of independent film.

Enjoy.",1231545600,3,5499,4.72507869884575
2526284,3,B000EPFCK4,"I have some pet peeves when it comes to movies.  One is movies lacking an ending.  This falls into that category.  Where one of the featured reviewers referred to the ending in a positive light, I'm not so charitable.  Frankly, the ending is artsy and it sucks with a capital S.

We grow involved in the three main characters, wealthy Rip Torn, his young Russian girlfriend, and his son.  The two men, father and son, both turn out to be bad luck for the Russian girl.  Rip Torn cheats on her constantly, apparently, and his son abandons her after she falls in love with him.

In the end, she walks away.  Where is she going?  Will she return?  She has a son.  Will she return to him?  Her future is left completely hidden, and that, apparently, is considered artsy.  It isn't.  It just sucks.  Don't lead me along to care about the characters and then just leave it hanging.  Basically, to the writer, Eff You.  This isn't art.  This is crap.

I give it three stars because it was interesting.  It deserved more, until the end.",1200614400,3,1028,4.419354838709677
2526285,5,B000EPFCK4,"I love how the story unfolds, the beautiful flawed characters, the simplicity of the performances, every single one.  I could feel the strain in the married couple's interactions, as well as hope and perhaps surrender.  Rip Torn is fun to watch in this film as well as others, but I was completely blown away by Darren Burrow's performance.  (My mind was like, holy cow, that guy played Ed Chigliak in the Northern Exposure series.)  Even without the comparison, his performance, restrained and so completely authentic, is over the top, fantastic.  The entire film just hits an authentic chord.",1179187200,7,594,5.020408163265306
2526286,3,B000EPFCK4,"""Forty Shades of Blue"" features Rip Torn as an acerbic, hard-drinking music producer in Memphis who, though greatly beloved by his fans and the people in the industry, is viewed somewhat differently by those who know him best.  Despite his advanced age, he has a gorgeous live-in girlfriend, Laura (Dina Korzun), whom he met while on a business trip to Russia and, even though they seem to be reasonably devoted to one another and their relationship, Laura is becoming increasing morose as a result of his constant philandering.  When Alan's married son, Michael (Darren E. Burrows) - who has reasons of his own for resenting the man - comes from California for a visit, he and Laura enter into a secret love affair that forces her to finally question her commitment to Alan and to perhaps cut the chords - both obligatory and emotional - that bind her to him.

Although the script does an effective job capturing the tensions simmering just beneath the surface of the story, the plot itself seems too conventional and too underdeveloped to engage the viewer completely.  Still the characters are complex enough and the performances sufficiently layered to at least hold our interest throughout.  Torn is particularly good at creating a character whose amiability and likeability on the surface mask a callousness and mean-spiritedness below.

This is a subtle, if not exactly gripping, study of the compromises we make - and the choices we come to regret - in our effort to avoid loneliness and to find meaning and happiness in life.",1167609600,17,1534,4.926356589147287
2526287,5,B000EPFCK4,"I don't think I've seen a movie as good, in a long, long time.  One of the ironies of life, is that we make some of our largest commitments with our feelings, our ""hearts"" rather than our minds.  This story is about a woman seeking love, letting her heart (and sometimes other parts) make her decisions for her, and it generally destroys her life, and that of the man most committed to her.  There aren't any real antagonists to speak of in this story, but there certainly are winners and losers.  Is there a better metaphor for life itself?",1157760000,6,541,4.434343434343434
2526288,5,B000EPFCK4,"This is the best movie I've seen in a long, long time.  Rip Torn is perfect for this role; and the actress playing his wife is as well.  If you like character studies, the finest cinematography around, the best script writing, excellent directing and feeling like you are a ""fly on the wall"" in the finest drama you have ever seen---buy this film.  It never lets up, it never overdoes, it just gives you exactly what you need.  And all without anyone blowing anyone elses brains out!",1157241600,14,483,4.517241379310345
2526289,1,B000EPFCK4,"One of the worst movies I've seen.  Dialogs are slow and every single performance is emotionless.  I did not build any kind of sympathy towards Rip Torn's character or his wife.  Yeah, you do get a sense that she's lonely, you do get a sense that he is a has-been still living the life of the rich and famous and you do see his somewhat distant son get it on with his mother-in-law. But might as well read it here as you'll feel no emotion whatsoever finding it out in the movie.  The music is the only thing that spares it from being terrible.

This movie is ranked right at the bottom of my list along with Van Sant's Last Days.  People seem to overrate these pieces of film waste just because they're different.  But my God, you can be different and good, entertaining and thought-provoking.

There is also nothing to show that she's a trophy wife; she is young and beautiful, but he clearly loves her very much.

2526355,1,B000EPFCK4,"Disjointed beginning, leading to further viewer confusion of who is who and who is doing who etc etc......Rip Torn, the lead actor, would be a good name for this dog. It's really bad so I killed it after 10 minutes and looked for better viewing fare, which is difficult to find these days unless you like zombies, vampires and other banal stuff which requires no intellect to watch. You asked and that's my opinion.",1368144000,,415,4.621621621621622
2526356,3,B000EPFCK4,"A little slow start but interesting tale of the oldest story of time, sexual seduction. Over all not a bad view, I did have to fast forward during some slow parts.",1367452800,,163,4.290322580645161
2526357,3,B000EPFCK4,I enjoyed the movie as entertainment while unable to sleep but I wouldn't say anything stood out in the movie itself. The actors were plausible but a little stilted (which was probably due to direction or the script itself). Good way to fall asleep again.,1367366400,,255,4.688888888888889
2526358,2,B000EPFCK4,"Each of three people in Forty Shades of Blue are beset by feelings and choices that leave them bereft of words.  Either due to his character or his skill, only Rip Torn communicates his bewilderment and his blundering choices beautifully.  The others seem less capable of allowing the body, the expression to wrap me into their world.  Thus, this film necessitates more words if you are not using skilled physical actors.  Sorry, I wanted to like it but I am not going to work that hard to sense and know their pain if they cannot get beyond ""my life is unmanageable so I will just suffer"" acting.",1367107200,,597,4.5514018691588785

2526361,3,B000EPFCK4,just barely got through it had to force myself to do so and couldn't seem to grasp the personalities or storyline too lite not substantial,1365811200,,138,4.56

2526363,1,B000EPFCK4,This was the most boring film I've seen in a while. It was nearly impossible to connect with any of the characters which made a nearly plot-less film drudgery. I only finished it because I was SURE that SOMETHING had to happen. I was wrong. Save your time.,1359504000,,256,4.354166666666667
2526364,3,B000EPFCK4,Rather raw to my taste. I did like enough to rent it after viewing most of the movie on prime video. I thought Riptorn's character was not believable enough.,1358208000,,157,4.448275862068965
2526365,1,B000EPFCK4,Moves incredibly slow.  I didn't care about any of the characters.  I just wasted 90 minutes of my life.  Excruciating,1358121600,,118,4.8
2526366,5,B000EPFCK4,The movie starts slowly and it slowly builds up little by little it gets more interesting Rip plays his character with gusto as an aging record producer who has a girlfriend 30 years his junior and the rest of the supporting casts did their parts well as can  be I would recommend this movie to anyone who has experienced tremendous loneliness and unpaid attention in spite of everything provided.,1352246400,2,397,4.753623188405797
2526367,1,B000EPFCK4,"I suppose this movie could probably appeal only to a specific niche.  If you see films as art and enjoy dissecting a movie into its separate components, you might like it; otherwise, if you appreciate movies as entertainment/a single piece of work that tells an interesting story, it could be torture.

I met the main characters in the beginning and found the film predictable from then on.  Apart from the lead, the characters generally have no depth and are just not engaging -- I didn't care for any of them.  I felt bad for the leading lady once, maybe twice -- but I got over it quickly.  The entire film drags on and on, as -- I found out too late -- there really isn't a story.  (No ending, either.  And, no, it's not one of those exciting cliff-hangers.)  Still, I kept it on because I hate not finishing movies that I've begun watching.  It was brutal.  I had hoped it was a ""slow burn"" that would give some satisfaction in the end.  But, no: It was an absolute waste of my time.",1344643200,2,988,4.344262295081967
2526368,3,B000EPFCK4,"We never really get to know these 3 characters.  Rip Torn doesn't have the subtlety to play this rich record producer.  His girlfriend and son, conversely, are often too subtle.  Maybe the script didn't give them enough revealing dialogue for any of them really make you feel one way or the other.  There wasn't anyone to like or dislike.  You just coldly find they all deserve their misery.",1344211200,4,391,4.6911764705882355
2526369,5,B000EPFCK4,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time. The performances were mesmerizing, especially Dina Korzun as Laura -- she is fantastic, I can't even think of another actress who could have pulled off that performance. My only complaint was that the character of the son's pregnant wife seemed unfishished. This quietly explosive thing is happening in her presence, but she seems oblivious, which just doesn't fit with the fact that she's supposed to be extremely educated/intelligent. (I am neither, but I'm pretty sure I would have figured out something was up.) Anyway, excellent movie -- I highly recommend it.",1247356800,2,620,5.029126213592233
