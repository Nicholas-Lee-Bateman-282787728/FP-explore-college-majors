8302190,1,B001FOPSY8,"As another reviewer pointed out, these narrators are far more interested in the weather during their trip and long, boring views of their hotel rooms than on providing any useful for practical information about Czech or Poland. Rick Steves represents the gold standard in travel documentaries and there's little reason to waste time or money with a cheap knockoff like this.",1431129600,,374,5.147540983606557
8302191,1,B001FOPSY8,"The woman narrating this travel DVD did a very poor job of it.  She didn't explain a lot of locations and
seemed to be more interested in the fact that it was cold there than any of the history.  She had no idea about what communism was like for people and maybe it would have been good if she read a little more and had expressed fewer of her own feelings.
I got a much better travel movie of Poland from our library and it had a very well informed narrator by the name
of Rick Stevens.  You would be better off renting or buying that one about Eastern Europe which included a good section
about Poland.",1372464000,3,604,4.145299145299146
