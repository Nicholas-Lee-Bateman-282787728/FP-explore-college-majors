8064676,5,B0009PB3HK,"A master's master instructor. I know the author and have taken many classes with him in Roanoke, Va at Eddie Thomas' karate school..-- as he occasionally goes on the road to teach his art. If you want to learn aikido you need the entire series and some poor fool to practice with who knows how to take a fall--frontwards, backwards, and flips. I own the entire series bought directly from him.  THe art is so fast you need the discs to play them back in slow mo to see what goes where. If you ever attend his classes in person, here is a word to the wise: never volunteer for anything. Otherwise you will learn the definition of pain compliance.",1444780800,2,645,4.375
8064677,3,B0009PB3HK,"Dispelling the ""myth"" that aikido is not a fight art?  In the context that aikido is an offensive art is just plain nonsense.  Morihei Uyshiba and his sons I would gather will both come to this conclusion.  Aikido was founded and is still practiced (with exception to authors trying hype there products for sale) with the idea of being used as purely a means of defense.  To my knowledge Kicks and strikes with the exception of being used as an example by your opponent for the use of demonstrating a defensive maneuver are offensive maneuvers and have very little to do with defense and more with destruction.  If this is your intent by all means get this video and a couple of Steven Segal DVD's while you're shopping for Hollywood blockbusters.  If you looking for the true nature of Aikido and the reason its one of the highest forms of martial art I suggest reading or watching something from the Founder or any one of many other reputable sources.  3 stars for the possibility you might learn a different perspective of Aikido not learned in a traditional dojo.",1130112000,5,1067,4.6436170212765955
