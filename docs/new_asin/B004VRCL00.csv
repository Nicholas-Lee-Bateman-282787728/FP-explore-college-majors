8443861,5,B004VRCL00,"American actor Mark Damon aka Johnny Yuma is featured in this excellent double billing from Wild East, with genre favorites Anthony Steffen and Lou Castel. ""Dead Men Don't Count"", the first film, Damon and Steffen are paired up bounty hunters falsely accused of murder in a lawless town ruled by racketeering lawmen... the pistols are loaded, the sun is blazing, the Madrid is scene, the music score is orchestrated to an almost perfect spaghetti western, not to be missed, 85 minutes.  The second feature, ""Kill And Pray"", conceals a dark shade of religious content and theme, similar to director Enzo Castellari's ""Keoma"". Lou Castel is the son of a preacher, who suddenly discovers how to shoot a pistol like a seasoned pro with a little help from the good book. Mark Damon portrays his darkest, most sadistic role ever in this violent western that also delivers the works, 100 minutes... both films are widescreen with excellent remastered transfers on a double sided disc. The interview with Mark Damon is worth the price of admission, Damon tells all.",1303776000,20,1057,4.971751412429379
