1425346,2,B00005BKZH,"Even Rob Lowe admits in his recent memoir that he could not imagine a major studio green-lighting this weird mess today. Themes of incest, bisexuality, rape, lesbianism and May-December romances aside, this totally fails to capture the John Irving novel on which it was based. Jodie Foster, Natasha Kinski and, especially, Rob Lowe, are all way too inexperienced as actors to make this complicated farce even begin to work. Lowe was so pretty, with his rosy cheeks, but his acting was lousy here. Are we supposed to believe that Beau Bridges, who looks about 35, was the father of Lowe and Foster here? I did not. This thing veers and lurches all over the map. Ultimately, it's pretty dull. For a 1984 production, it really shows its age.",1325721600,,738,4.7734375

I like this sort of offbeat movie.
Jodie Foster is excellent as usual.

This disc is actually fullscreen format.
On a full screen tv, there will be bars on the top and bottom of the picture.
On a widescreen tv, there will be bars on all four sides, if you set the
Picture Size to 4:3 to view the movie with the proper aspect ratio.

Depending on the player and the tv's capabilities, you may be able to
choose a Picture Size that will at least eliminate the bars on the sides of
the picture - while preserving the proper aspect ratio.  My widescreen tv
will only do this, via picture size 'Zoom1', if the tv input is not HDMI/1080,

1425349,1,B00005BKZH,"THE HOTEL NEW HAMPSHIRE (1984) in theory should have been a
fascinating, exciting movie with a lot of crowd-drawing power, from
its all-star cast, made up of Jodie Foster, Nastassja Kinski, Rob
Lowe and more, all in their prime ... aged 20 to 30 years, at the
time.

Unfortunately, this picture was written in 1 of 3 possible ways:
someone who's adapted the painting technique of throwing buckets of
paint at a canvas, calling himself a painter, and the result, a
painting to the movies; or someone with the mental age of 10; or
someone who has not only totally lost their mind, and has lost touch
with reality, in the present, and in their past.

Of course, it's a treat to see Foster, Kinski, Lowe in action, as
they are truly talented, in bringing forth subtle human
undercurrents, and visual expressions to the camera and audience.

But, this work apparently attempts to carry to the silver screen, a
novel in the style of Kurt Vonnegut, for example, or Douglas Adams,
who wrote Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy, among others. I haven't
read, (and now, would probably decline to ever read) the original
manuscript or novel, but, most would probably give the benefit of
the doubt to the underlying book author.

In terms of movie, though, there's indubitably no redeeming value to
it, as it's a unrelenting, spastic sequence of absurd, tasteless,
unnecessary, unsavory moments, involving taboo after taboo,
intermixed with a sugar coating, to perhaps confusem, fool and
mesmerize the censors or movie rating authorities.

The sugar coating of the taboos, might perhaps make palatable the
underlying sequences to those with a low IQ, or perhaps to children,
but for all others, including teenagers, or seniors or those with a
wicked sense of humor, there's really no coherent story progressing
over the 90 mins.

As such, and the best remedy is really the fast forward button on
the DVD player, or, if you prefer (as was the case, in the 80's when
this work was released), getting up from your chair, and walking out
of the theatre.",1270166400,,2033,4.827586206896552

1425351,1,B00005BKZH,"This is truly a terrible film, and not in a great campy-terrible, ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" terrible, but just poorly written, sloppily directed and edited, and un- or under-motivated.

One of the main problems was a genuine inconsistency in tone, where the director apparently couldn't decide if he was making a Keystone Kops farce or a bittersweet comedy.  I knew I was in for a bad trip when, for no apparent reason, he sped up the film when Rob Lowe was making a football play, making the action fast-motion for no apparent reason -- a tactic he did a number of other times in the film, again for no apparent reason.

The story lurches from event to event without any character really developing his or her personality, so ultimately, you don't really care about what happens to them.  Worse, anything that does happen to them is breezed by fairly superficially, as in the example of the deaths of two important characters in the film.  What seems whimsical in Irving seems absurd and incredible here.  Oh, and there is no chemistry whatsoever between Foster and Lowe.",1214438400,,1078,4.768817204301075
1425352,2,B00005BKZH,"That the exploits of the very odd (to say the least) Berry family contains some wonderful performances from the young Jodie Foster and Rob Lowe in Tony Richardson's adaptation of John Irving's THE HOTEL NEW HAMPSHIRE goes without saying; but the chopped-up manner in which Richardson has handled Irving's narrative also goes without saying that it is a terrible hack job that flits quickly from scene to scene hardly allowing any of Irving's characters to develop, much less breathe. What we have here, in short, is a ghastly mess of a film about ""passing windows"" successfully without jumping out of them! There are so many themes that Richardson has drawn from Irving's novel,but not one of them is followed through successfully, and  the result is a jolting ride leaving the viewer scratching their heads and saying ""What was he thinking?"".The only two characters that seem to survive in this film are Franny and Johnno thanks to the acting skills of Foster and Lowe respectively, as two sexual obsessed brother and sister who pine for each other. The relationship between those two is monitored more closely than the rest of this rag-tag bunch of eccentrics who are given erratic amounts of screen time which does not allow their characters to become anymore than just someone ""Passing a window"" of which they should have all jumped out...including Richardson. This film suffers from misguided direction and an inept screenplay adaptation. Only the performances of Foster and Lowe are at all noteworthy in this throwaway debacle! No small wonder that it took Irving,himself, to finally adapt his own work in THE CIDER HOUSE RULES before getting a proper treatment of his always odd
characters!",1196208000,,1697,5.060714285714286

I didn't get to see this movie until I rented it from netflix a couple of months ago, and the reason I'm writing this review is because I came to Amazon to buy the movie, and I happened to see the bad reviews, and decided to put my 2 cents in. So there you have it.",1177200000,,503,3.9313725490196076
1425356,2,B00005BKZH,"You want to turn away but you just can't stop watching!  Like other reviewers suggest, maybe I need to read the book.  The film on it's own holds the audience attention by bouncing from one obscure situation to another while remaining emotionally vacant. Some admirable performances by a suprisingly well known and talented cast. Definately one for those who prefer something from the 'art house' movie genre.",1175731200,,409,5.08955223880597
1425357,2,B00005BKZH,"If you have not read the book, then this movie may intrigue you. It is quirky and interesting to say the least. As a storyline it does not lack imagination. From Maine to Vienna to NYC and back to Maine, from the Jew-hating German tourists to the radicals and the [...], from one Hotel New Hampshire to another, the dreams of a father and his colourful family unfold in a series of bizarre and at times disturbing events. And life appears to be a fairy tale that we live as we chase our dreams.

Now, in relation to the actual book, this movie can be described with just one word: RUSHED. The adaptation is so faithful that it tries to cover almost everything, all characters and all events, thereby failing miserably to project the sentiment behind the eccentric story of this highly unusual family. I could go on and on about how the accurate quotes from the original text fall flat on a screenplay that comes across truncated and patched together clumsily, how the scenes lack emotional depth, how the characters are not given enough time to be adequately developed... but I will instead characterise the whole attempt as noble but short. If the book was a long wave-like function, with a rise to a crest, then a drop followed by a building surge and another rise to another crest, over and over and over again, then the movie was just a cross-section of the top parts of this rollercoaster of a wave-like function, shaving off all the crests and placing them in a two hour blender, where they were shaken and served to please God knows what. Surely not the potential of this fascinatingly bizarre book, nor its undercurrent and extremely subtle magical tone. And it was not for lack of effort. It was for lack of realism on how to put on screen a highly bizzare story in a way that flows smoothly rather than jump spastically between scenes. A mini series would have worked much better for such a faithful adaptation. Either that or a more free-flowing interpretation that could possibly make sense within the 120 minutes that are usually allocated to a motion picture.

Thank God for Jodie Foster's and Beau Bridges's performances, who bring Fanny and Win Berry to life. Keep passing the open windows and read the book for a much richer and meaningful experience. As far as this movie is concerned, just toss it out as far as you can. And if you are to keep it, then do so to remind yourselves of how to NOT adapt a great book onto the screen. This is the only reason why I keep mine.",1172620800,,2489,4.528888888888889
1425358,1,B00005BKZH,"I loved the book and the film of THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP when they first came out.  Then I read THE HOTEL NEW HAMPSHIRE.  I thought it was horrible.  When they made a movie, I went to the theatre in the off-chance that they managed to make a good movie from a lame book (it's possible).

No.  THE HOTEL NEW HAMPSIRE is also pretty horrible.

The characters are quirky for the sake of quirky.  I never believed them.  They work so hard to be cute and unconventional that they're completely smug and obnoxious, draining all sympathy for them.  Stylistically, it's just confusing.  When Rob Lowe zips over to bed his foul-mouthed sister Jodie Foster, I had to wonder what the filmmakers were shooting for.  Slapstick incest?

I didn't read John Irving for years because, after this, I thought he'd shot his wad with GARP and was just writing the same story over and over.",1159660800,,872,4.554838709677419
1425359,4,B00005BKZH,"Following the success of The World According to Garp, another offbeat John Irving novel was filmed.  The Hotel New Hampshire is about another offbeat family.  This time the Berry's are examined.  Father - Winn and Mother - Betty (Beau Bridges and Lisa Banes) met while working at the Hotel New Hampshire.  The had five children - Frank (Paul McCrane), Franny (Jodie Foster), Johnny (Rob Lowe), Lilly (Jennie Dundas) and Egg (a very young Seth Green).

Win works as a teacher at Dairy private school where his father, Iowa Bob (Wilford Brimley), is the coach.  But Win and Betty want to recapture their youth and open a hotel (and name it after the hotel where they met.)  They buy an abandoned girls school near Dairy school.  They convert it and open it.  Just as they are all misfits, their clientele are also misfits.  They get an invitation to open another hotel in Vienna.  And they do the same.

This film is not about story, it is about characters.  This film serves you a wide variety of characters from the lovely Anita Morris as the oversexed waitress to Natasha Kinski as a woman who hides in a bear suit.  And of course, Wallace Shawn as Freud.

Each of the four stars, Foster, Lowe, Bridges and Kinski, had their careers in transition.  They were looking for the breakout hit to take their career to the next level.  This film was widely admired but not a box office smash.  Foster would only have to wait a couple of years (The Accused).  Lowe would have to wait fourteen years to achieve success in The West Wing.  Bridges would become the king of the cable movies.

The film is written and directed by Tony Richardson (look for his daughter Joely Richardson in a bit role at the beginning of the film).

WARNING: This film has scenes of abuse, rape and incest.  So, this may not be suitable for young children.

1425360,2,B00005BKZH,"I absolutely loved the John Irving book that this was based upon.  Very quirky (especially for it's time), hilariously funny, and the characters he created were magnificent.  In my opinion however, the movie was uninteresting and only mildly funny.  Not many movies do justice to the books they've been based upon, for many reasons.  This is no excuse for Hotel New Hampshire however.  Irving's ""World according to Garp"" was a superb book (similar in length and complexity to Hotel NH), and was made into a very good movie.  I'd recommend checking out that one instead if you want to see a John Irving novel of this period on film.",1132531200,,631,4.743119266055046

The book takes you down several different paths that the movie doesn't go-but watching the movie gives you more feelings for the characters, their passions and discoveries than the book can. Especially in the case of Win, the father and his father, Iowa Bob, the original owner of the family bear, State of Maine-there are things done in the movie that can't really be visualised in the book. Also, the Hotel Manager is more visually interesting.  The Hotel New Hampshire is the only John Irving book or movie that I have read or seen, alhtough I am very much looking forward to The Cider House Rules.

The book left me with a slight feeling of despair-though I saw the movie twenty years ago, it gave me more of a feeling of hope for the Berry's, in a somewhat Scarlett O'Hara, ""I'll think about that tomorrow"" fashion.",1109808000,,942,4.595238095238095

1425364,5,B00005BKZH,"""The Hotel New Hampshire"" is, indeed, not ""very easy"". If you're into ""American Pie"" or something, it's likely not to work for you. It's fast, subtile, black humor, surrealistic sometimes, and there's no ""audience laugher"" to know when you're supposed to laugh - and that's probably why people don't like (or understand) it. It can take more than one watch to get it all, and it sure deserves it.
The book's no requirement at all, like some of the obtuse reviewers above are arguing. In fact, i only know of Irving's existence from hearabouts - and still HNH was a masterpiece that made me laugh to tears. The flatulent dog named Sorrow. The (quick) way people die. Incest, clowns, rape, and Kinski wearing a bear suit. Do you want more to life than this? and there is.
Like one of the reviews i've read before, in this film the joke isn't assigned, all weird is put as just normal and if you don't have the hability to laugh at the bizarre on normal things you'll maybe find this movie a bored, puzzling experience.
It's ironical, thought, to think that maybe it was made to be this little hermetic and still so little people can get it. This world is ruined.",1075680000,,1160,4.5285714285714285
1425365,1,B00005BKZH,"A savagely bad movie, adapting John Irving's novel wherein the baby boomer generation attempts to digest the muddled narcissism of the '70s.  That description, however, gives this flick too much credit.  Mostly this is just a terrible film -- badly written, uninvolving and lurching about without apparent purpose, and without an emotional center.  An incestual relationship between brother and sister, amid a wacky, unconventional family is supposed to somehow elicit our sympathies -- but its execution is as flat an unbelievable as the rest of the film.  The cast, however, has some nice celeb-spotting eye-candy: Jody Foster, Wallace Shawn, and a 9-year old Seth Green.  Rob Lowe is the movie's sole saving grace... As the perv-bound sibling, he was certainly breaking out of his brat pack bimbo typecasting; it's fascinating to see him working on the quirks and mannerisms he later built into a solid acting style.  And at age 19, he's pretty hunky... easy on the eyes.  But other than a chance to see a bunch of famous folks at an odd moment in their careers, this film is a total waste of time.  (See also: ""The Royal Tennenbaums."")",1039910400,,1139,4.957894736842105
1425366,3,B00005BKZH,"""The Hotel New Hampshire"" is a very pretty movie with a strong cast, good direction and interesting ideas - so why does it fail to be a great film? Largely because as it stands, it's very disjointed; it appears that the screenwriters took only small snips from the book without bothering to segue from one development to the next, leaving the viewer who hasn't read the novel to flounder in bewilderment.
In a nutshell, we view the family through Rob Lowe's character's eyes, as he tells us about their struggles over the years. While the story focuses on John (Lowe) and Frannie (Foster,) everyone has an important part to play. The family faces trial after trial, from death to rape to incest to relocating themselves to another continent, but their ties to each other keep them strong. That is, most of the time: There are moments and actions when suddenly the family can't keep itself cohesive, with disastrous results that are only barely explained. It seems everyone is looking for something bigger, better and *more*, but they cannot seem to find it, either within themselves or without. John tells the story in a very matter-of-fact way, without casting blame or judgment on anyone for their thoughts or behaviors, even though some would find room for condemnation. He seems to be saying ""Folks are folks, and sometimes behave in unusual extreme ways; but that doesn't mean they're bad people, or without feeling.""
However, motives are usually not clear; characters act completely out of character for no imaginable reason, on small and grand scales, leading to large developments which have no foundation. Rob Lowe and Jodie Foster perform very well, especially given their age and experience in 1984, and they actually do a good job with what they're given. Paul McCrane's character could have been much more interesting, but he is relegated almost to cameo status, and we're never quite sure why he and Seth Green's character are so obsessed with Sorrow, the family's unfortunate dog (and the basic underlying theme to the entire story.)
There are some very warm and funny moments in the film, as well as a couple of poignant ones - but we don't know or care about the characters well enough to truly feel their pain when someone important to them passes away. The audience is left with far more questions than answers, when it all comes right down to it.
It's not a bad movie on it's own, but neither is it *good*.",1038960000,,2426,4.820143884892087
1425367,2,B00005BKZH,"This movie is quite odd, but never boring.  I didn't read the John Irving book from which it was adapted, but I can guess that, as is typical of the author, the book must juggle a multitude of characters and sub-plots.  Unfortunately, it really doesn't work as a movie and ends up feeling like a series of loosely connected vignettes.  The plot speeds along much too quickly and characters appear and disappear without much reason.  The movie does, however, have a few positive points...
First, the cast is first-rate and Rob Lowe has one of his most unusual roles (this was his third movie after ""The Outsiders"" and ""Class""), as a confused young man lusting after his sister (Jodie Foster, who's ok).  Paul McCrane (ER's Dr. Romano) has one of his few relatively large film roles.  The movie looks great, with beautiful location shooting with Canada substituting for New Hampshire and Vienna.  Finally, this is probably the only place you can see Matthew Modine being raped by a person in a bear suit.  Overall, a very strange journey that makes little sense and doesn't bear up to much scrutiny.  A definite disappointment.",1030838400,,1125,4.817708333333333

1425369,1,B00005BKZH,"Verdict first - What a load of (...)! And why should I bother to explain this? Nothing in this this movie is explained to me. But I will anyway.
This is supposed to be an adaptation of the John Irving novel of the same name. But if you call pushing the 10 most individually photogenic pieces from a 1000-piece jigsaw into a loose assemblage an adaption, then you'll call Natasha Kinski in a bear suit a grizzly.
This movie would have done much better to focus on one character, one relationship, or one section of the novel. This would have allowed the makers the chance to develop some depth or at least explain the events that barge erratically and irritatingly past us.
As it is, nothing is explained. In an early rape scene involving Jodie Foster's character (of course), her brother manages to find a group of ""coloreds"" to belatedly rescue her. Where they come from in this rural, white, middle-class, New England environment is not explained, nor is it explained why they agree to get involved.
After a few more disjointed scenes, the whole family decides to migrate to Vienna. As the movie doesn't bother to explian why, those who haven't read Irvings novl are left to conclude that they must have some kind of 'homing instinct' for this European capital.
The psychology behind ""Susie the Bear"" is also skimped on; Lili's suicide is pointlessly included with her ""passing through an open window"" merely after being asked a tough question by a book reviewer; the Vienna radicals and prostitutes are only afforded comic cut-out status; and the incest between the brother and sister ends up being presented like a cartoon caper.
Everywhere in this overloaded little film, eccentric facade triumphs over the intriguing insights into the strange and comic events of life that we usually get in John Irving novels.
Obviously what's wrong with this film - apart from an over-young cast who aren't capable of keeping the hurly-burly circus of odd scenes and characters believable - is the whole notion of capitaliizing on a popular novel. Cinema and writing are different media. A novel can revel in a great web of causation, whereas a movie is better at capturing the subtleties of the moment.
By using the novel's title, the filmmakers believe they have an obligation to touch on every character and event in the original novel with a crude disregard for artistic unity, resulting in a travesty for which the director should be thrown through an open window. ""Keep passing the open windows,"" and don't stop for this hopeless adaptation either.",1011484800,,2545,4.8663594470046085
1425370,3,B00005BKZH,"This is a story about life and the many facets of love, dreams and aspirations, and the journey of discovery we all have to make in our own way in our own time.  But the single thread that runs through the film and ties the characters and their lives together is sorrow; and in this instance, using an extremely overt metaphor, ""Sorrow"" is the family pet-- a dog-- who comes to symbolize a seemingly prevalent condition of the Berry family in ""The Hotel New Hampshire,"" written for the screen and directed by Tony Richardson, adapted from the novel by John Irving.  The story centers on the Berry family, a close but eccentric clan, and is told from the perspective of John (Rob Lowe), who tries to make sense of his too familiar relationship with his sister, Frannie (Jodie Foster), his gay older brother, Frank (Paul McCrane), his literally ""little"" sister, Lilly (Jennifer Dundas) who ""isn't a midget,"" but who stopped growing too soon, the youngest of the bunch, Egg (Seth Green), his grandfather, Iowa Bob (Wilford Brimley) and his parents (Beau Bridges and Lisa Banes).
John's father, Win, was a dreamer, or as Lilly called him, a ""Gatsby,"" always looking for something better, for ""it.""  Win and Mother Berry had met one summer working together at a hotel, and when Win tires of his job as a school teacher, he decides their town needs a hotel.  So he buys an abandoned building that suits his needs perfectly, and transforms it into a hotel, the Hotel New Hampshire, owned and operated by the entire Berry family.  And it is here that the memories of his formative years are made for John; memories like struggling with his love for his sister while she lives through a particularly traumatic experience that involves a boy of whom she is enamored, Chip Dove (Matthew Modine), and tasting love himself for the first time with a waitress at the hotel (Joely Richardson).  It is also at this time that he experiences a death in the family for the first time.  And, as it is in life, it won't be the last; nor will it be his final encounter with tragedy and sorrow.
In this film, Richardson touches upon a number of themes that at one time (and not that long ago) would have been considered taboo in a film:  Homosexuality, incest and interracial relationships.  And he does it successfully by weaving them into the story naturally and objectively, without expounding upon or exploring them simply to enhance the drama.  This is simply the story of the Berry family, for better or worse, with John telling it like it is while refraining from any sensationalism or judgment calls, to which the likes of a film of this nature would ordinarily be disposed.
Lowe gives a convincing performance as John-- arguably some of the best work he's ever done-- and he underscores his role of narrator by making the story as much about the others as about himself, which is generous, and a good piece of acting.  Foster, who would've been twenty-one or twenty-two when this was filmed (1984), displays an insight, poise and maturity well beyond her years, with a performance that is intuitively discerning and believable, and which serves the character so well while bringing her vividly to life.  There is such a natural quality to Foster's acting that it makes her a joy to watch, and it makes Frannie a memorable character.  The young Dundas is also very impressive in the role of Lilly and, like Foster, manages to bring the necessary maturity to the character that makes her entirely credible.
The supporting cast includes Wallace Shawn (Freud), Dorsey Wright (Junior), Cali Timmins (Bitty), Anita Morris (Ronda Ray) and Walter Massey (Texan).  The film is by turns poignant, funny and disturbing; one could say a succinct reflection of life.  And, diverse as this story is, thematically, there will undoubtedly be one aspect of it or another to which just about anyone will be able to relate.  Because that's what life is; a journey we all share, but which we take on different roads that sooner or later are bound to intersect, and which becomes the point at which we realize something that's inescapable and possibly the most important thing we will ever learn:  That we are not alone in this.  And, in the final analysis, that is what ""The Hotel New Hampshire"" is all about.  And that's the magic of the movies.",995414400,,4311,4.746987951807229
1425371,1,B00005BKZH,"The adaptation of John Irving's fifth novel, and the one I've read the most times over the years, ""The Hotel New Hampshire"" suffers from a great many things, most notably being the appalling lack of any common sense or good judgment in the casting of Nastassia (sp?) Kinski as Susie the Bear. The character of Susie is supposed to have such low self-esteem and is described in the book as a plain-looking average woman who thinks herself so ugly that she hides herself in a bear costume.
When she finally takes off the bear head in the movie and is revealed to be a gorgeous woman with supermodel looks, it's hard for us, the audience, to have any sympathy for her inferiority complex. Combine this glaring oversight with the more traditional scriptwriting dilemna of how to boil down such a multi-layered, complex, rich narrative into a two hour time frame that the average moviegoer will tolerate and you arrive at a script that simplifies and drains all the larger than life splendour of the magnificent novel. This is the Roach Motel of film adaptations of great works of Literature.",993513600,,1087,4.756613756613756
1425372,5,B00005BKZH,"The only movie I know which was truly faithful to (part of) the book is ""Gone with the wind"", because it did not attempt to picture the entire span of the story. Grisham's books were so obviously written with movie in mind that they can't be compared, and Elmore Leonard's twisted plots make movies as much entertaining, even if not fully faithful, as the books are. But this one, which is more like putting pieces from the book one after another is so perfectly crafted by Tony Richardson, and a faultless casting, that it fully convey the spirit of the writing, much more than ""world according to Garp"" or ""Cider House Rules"". Nevertheless, I must admit that for somebody who did not read the story before seeing the movie, it might be a bit more difficult to follow, because of all the shortcuts. But it is one of the few movies where every scene was looking like 'dj vu', as well the characters as the backgrounds, and the only one of the 3 adapted from J. Irving's books I've seen; I can't say about ""Simon Birch"" since I've seen Jim Carrey before,and once was one time too many.",992563200,,1084,4.47979797979798

Jeff Bridges is the head of his family, an odd creative bunch to be sure. Jodie Foster, the pragmatic oldest child who is street wise beyond her years due to circumstances; Rob Lowe is the doe eyed innocent who seeks purpose; Natasha Kinski is the withdrawn beauty who finds security from the world by wearing a bear suit, that the family meets in Europe, who finds a home almost immediately in this family.",1424217600,,635,4.435897435897436

7937982,3,B00005BKZH,"Tony Richardson's adaptation of THE HOTEL NEW HAMPSHIRE proves that the unique qualities of John Irving's fiction are accessible in print and elusive on screen. (Not surprisingly, Irving's books were not truly successful as films until Irving himself adapted The Cider House Rules, although some viewers will prefer The World According to Garp.)

Here, Richardson distills the essence of Irving but misses the author's dominant themes; the result is a film that follows Irving closely and understands its characters without ever giving them complete and coherent personalities. Without that essential ingredient, this film--about the exploits of a highly eccentric and dysfunctional family--grows thin and repetitious. We're left to enjoy the quirks of a fine ensemble cast, and the resilience of a family that has learned to survive by ""passing open windows"" (in other words, avoiding suicide no matter how tempting).

Beau Bridges is the Berry family patriarch and resident free spirit of the Hotel New Hampshire, where his children thrive on liberal parenting, a parade of unusual patrons, and their own lust for life, love, and--in the case of incestuous siblings John (Rob Lowe) and Frannie (Jodie Foster)--each other.

Their coming-of-age tales are often a joy to behold, and Richardson draws some excellent performances from his young, stellar cast. What's missing here is a sense of deeper meaning and resonance; the film seems oddly random, while Irving's book clearly conveys an affectionate fascination with the tenacity of the human spirit.

From Academy Award-winning* director Tony Richardson (Tom Jones) comes this ""bright, amusing and provocative"" (The Hollywood Reporter) film based on John Irving's best-selling novel. Featuring ""a gifted cast"", including Oscar winner Jodie Foster (The Silence of the Lambs), Rob Lowe (""The West Wing"") and Beau Bridges (The Fabulous Baker Boys), The Hotel New Hampshire is ""intriguing"" (Boxoffice), ""impressive"" and ""fascinating""!

A motley clan of eight lovable misfits, the Berry family sets out on an adventure to fulfill their father's lifelong aspiration of owning a hotel. Their quest takes them around the world, and they greet every new location with their own brand of outrageous humor, practical jokes and just plain weird eccentricism. But when this tribe of oddballs encounters a healthy dose of heartbreak, they soon must learn that not all in life is fun and games and that sometimes the only thing you have left is the one thing that matters most family. *1963: Best Picture, Director **1991: Actress, The Silence of the Lambs; 1988: Actress, The Accused
