8234939,5,B000Z7G8AY,"If you are planning on taking a cruse which will cover Italy and Greece and you want to start to get oriented, this is the first disk that you want to get.  While it is too short, it is packed with the major tourist destinations listed in the product description.  It has 6 chapters: Ancient Greece, Preservation (about the Parthenon), The Greek Islands, Venice & Florance, Rome and Malta.  Each well narrated chapter and subsection begins with a map showing you where in the Mediterranean you are going to see and then you will be told about the major sites.  The information is primarily geographical and historical (or art history) and there is no information about tourist accommodations or food or any of the other key points for a land based vacation. There are many shots taken from the bow of a cruise ship.  So, clearly this was designed to give people weighing different shore excursions ideas.  There are definitely a LOT of missing sites (Pompeii, Pisa, and the Pantheon are notable omissions) but what is here is well presented and pleasant to see.  After this, I would take a look at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Visions-of-Italy/dp/B0006U5UT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Visions of Italy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Visions-of-Greece/dp/B00028G6B2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Visions of Greece</a>&nbsp;for a more complete view of the countries or watch any of the major ""travel personalities"" to touch on the culture/arts.  I would definitely recommend this disk before the others if you don't know the geography and want to get a quick global picture in your head before other disks can fill in the details.",1268956800,3,1728,5.72265625
