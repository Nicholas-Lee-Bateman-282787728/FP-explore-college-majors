8140245,3,B000GAKODM,"The instructor does not explain what he's doing in much detail - in fact, hardly any.  Most of the time he just plays the song and the camera shows his fingers.  Maybe that's all there is to it, but  this particular DVD does not include the same level of detailed teaching featured in the  other titles in the ""Guitar of...."" series from Steffan Grossman's Guitar Workshop.",1428710400,,373,4.606060606060606
8140246,5,B000GAKODM,"Great lessons well taught by someone who really knows his stuff. I would argue that the arrangements aren't always that faithful, but the instruction is invaluable.",1424822400,,164,5.346153846153846
8140247,5,B000GAKODM,"Great tutorial if you want the real thing blues. Now, if I only had time to pick up my guitar and practice...",1378944000,,109,4.0
8140248,4,B000GAKODM,"This is the best Leadbelly instruction video available.  Requires practice.  Starts relatively easy, but adds difficulty.  The songs are worth the money.",1355529600,3,153,5.863636363636363
