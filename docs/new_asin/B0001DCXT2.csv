8010312,5,B0001DCXT2,"Knights Of The Zodiac is a really cool action packed anime series. It is based on a comic book by Masami Kurumada.

This DVD contains episodes 5, 6, 7, and 8, with the 8th episode being my personal favorite. In that episode, Seiya, Shiryu, Hyoga, and Shun need to retrieve the pieces of the Gold Cloth from the Black Knights and prevent Shun's brother Ikki from wearing the Cloth.

This is the English Dub of the show by DiC. This version of the show is censored. The blood is changed from red to blue, the dialogue is more lighthearted, and it cuts out the overly violent scenes that are in the Japanese version. This version also has a really awesome opening theme.

I'm really glad I bought this DVD. It's a very fun show and I highly recommend it.",1412467200,2,751,4.388489208633094
