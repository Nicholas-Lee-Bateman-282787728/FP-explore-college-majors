8082704,5,B000B6TSG0,"Beautifully restored with terrific Technicolor color contrasts, and superbly detailed, imaginative animation, this collection includes the last 2 Superman cartoons made by the Fleischer Studios, who made 9 episodes between 1941-1942, and the first 6 by the Famous Studios, who took over between 1942-1943 and made 8 episodes. All of them feature the voice of Clayton ""Bud"" Collyer as Superman, and Joan Alexander as Lois, and music by Sammy Timberg (with occasional additional music by Winston Sharples). All have the Paramount Pictures ""It's a bird! It's a plane!"" intro. There are a lot of WWII themes in the episodes, some racial stereotyping, and total playing time is 67 minutes. For those who admire early animation, this collection is a must-have. Episode list:
