If you are interested in the subject, a must-buy. Why no one has made a hollywood blockbuster out of this story of horror, courage and humanity is a mystery.
If anyone knows of other good records of this American tragedy, please send me a note!",1231372800,3,399,4.714285714285714
8104839,3,B000E371KA,"I bought this for my grandson, as his great-grandparents lived in Texas City at the time of the disaster.  This story has been told and re-told down the generations of the family, from their perspective.  My ex-husband was 7 years old, and remembered that the entire horizon seemed on fire.

The video did bring the story to life for us, and placed it in a broader context.  While the History Channel tried to dramatize the story a bit, the real drama was in the facts themselves.  I was particularly interested in the old newsreels and radio reports that were presented.

Worth the price, if you are interested in the Texas City Fire.",1212364800,,635,4.625
