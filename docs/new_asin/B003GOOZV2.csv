4123404,2,B003GOOZV2,Boring kept going back between being a movie based on a true story and a documentary. The characters are dull andre storyline is weak.,1374192000,2,134,4.625
4123405,4,B003GOOZV2,"Really well written. Well thought out characters. There's comedy, a little bit of drama, a little romance (and it's realistic unlike almost every other movie ever). It's funny. It seemed longer than it was but I really enjoyed this.",1367280000,,232,4.9743589743589745
4123406,3,B003GOOZV2,"Yeah, the movie is cute and unfortunately realistic!  I don't really remember laughing, but it's nice to watch something light and meaningful. It could have been a little shorter, but I really enjoyed the multiethnic approach!  I think I understood the approach and I definitely appreciated watching something with some value without all of the morbidity and immoral degradation.",1357948800,4,379,5.406779661016949
4123407,5,B003GOOZV2,"While unsure of how this film showed up in my genre search, I'm so glad it did. Funny, refreshing, quirky and layered, with excellent acting, my question now is, where's it been hiding. Great movie!",1355616000,,198,4.685714285714286
4123408,5,B003GOOZV2,"I laughed several times through out this film. My five star rating is based on this being a B-rate movie. I'm thinking back on the parts now that had me laughing and I'm telling you, go for it. I'm glad they picked the cover picture that they did, that's what reeled me in. The director did a good job covering his bases, and I bet if you're Asian American you'll be able to appreciate this even more. This movie could have been a disaster and I'm pretty tough on ""corny"" things yet he did some ninja script writing to avoid that. It could use just a little bit of tightening up, to shave about 10 minutes off. However, Im giving an extra point for some of the really good parts that got a little deep (Movie Reference but not a spoiler ""Oh when the Saints""). He definitely kept it real. This would be a good movie for 18 to 35ish to watch. But I bet my parents who are not in that braket at all would enjoy this film too. In my opinion I'd say this movie isn't predictable either, which was nice!

SPOILER BEYOND THIS PART

I have to say, I must have laughed the hardest on the part where the mom threw a knife at her husband's leg. Crazy lady!",1355616000,3,1145,4.153153153153153
8396517,1,B003GOOZV2,Another race baiting lame a@@ psuedo comedy. For God's sakes will there EVER EVER EVER be a black comedian that will just be FUNNY and not try to play the race card. YAWN> YAWN> YAWN> it's over done. STop it already. ENOUGH. MOVE ON.,1513900800,,233,4.318181818181818
8396518,2,B003GOOZV2,"Whoa, this is definitely a indie stinker! It does appear to reflect how tough it is make it into show business. An ensemble of mostly unknown actors exhaust themselves in a overblown comedy tainted with inappropriate nonsense and profanity. Unfortunately, the performers are learning too late how awful this feature film would be for them. They push themselves too hard with plenty of over acting hoping this be their showcase film reel. You may wish to pass by this audition tape. The movie is helpful in communicating there are worthy life prospects than entertainment fame and fortune. Nonetheless, why suffer in the process to learn why?",1488326400,,641,5.056603773584905
