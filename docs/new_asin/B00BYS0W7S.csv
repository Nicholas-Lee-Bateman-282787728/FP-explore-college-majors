8575711,5,B00BYS0W7S,Great movies every one.  The digital copies look just at good as when I've seen these protected from original prints.  Can't beat the price of getting them in a collection too.,1502150400,,176,4.645161290322581
8575712,5,B00BYS0W7S,"I'm a fan of Hitchcock, and this blu-ray set didn't disappoint! The only thing I would change is that instead of having ""North by Northwest"" in the set, I would've liked to have seen ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"". But I love having the original posters next to the disc in the set!",1478908800,4,279,4.185185185185185
