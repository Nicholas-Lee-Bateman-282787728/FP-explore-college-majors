8522548,5,B007WB5DAW,"This concert took place in Berlins Schauspielhaus on 31 March 1992 when Sergiu Celibidache returned after a thirty-eight-year absence to conduct the B7 with the Berliner Philharmoniker. If you're a sucker for slow meditative Bruckner, it doesnt come any better than this, even if the lack of contrast between the first two movements, tempo-wise, might drive some to distraction. The sound is rich and showcases the Klang of the orchestra. Its well-directed: the camera is always where it needs to be. The cymbal crash in the Adagio is an obvious highlight. Rarely if ever has the finale been played with so much Innigkeit  and the coda itself is glorious (even if the last bar or two is less than immaculate). Celi conducts without a score. His mojo is undeniable. As per usual, I detest the use of video and its lack of pixilation. That being said, it looks better than Karajans Sony horrors of the mid-Eighties.

For once, the Bonus lives up to its name. As evidenced by his behaviour in the rehearsals for this concert, its easy to see why Celi was given the boot in November 1954 on the eve of Furtwnglers death and the accession of Karajan. Bruckners Seventh Symphony is staple fare for the Berlin Philharmonic. In lieu of his outlier concept of the B7, I have no doubt that Celi needed to reset the orchestra somewhat  but I question the wisdom of taking the Berlin Phil back to kindergarten for the event in question. The pedagogy is laborious and hectoring. Worst of all, Celi shrieks at the Viola section and then sarcastically thanks it for showing up in a particular passage. The eyes of the orchestra are signal: to expiate the past, theyll tolerate this Sacred Monster as a once-off but no more than that. Strange: in the concert itself, Celi is joviality itself. Old hands of the Berlin Philharmonic such as Hartmann, Bastiaan and Thrichen are at hand to recount the events of 1954. Never one to mince his words, the latter confirms that Celi was a slave-driver whose threats to make wholescale changes to the orchestra couldn't have been more poorly timed.

This DVD is well-worth your hard-earned coin.",1524960000,6,2118,4.778688524590164

8522550,3,B007WB5DAW,"Let's be clear--this is a performance ONLY for those who are both Bruckner true-believers and Celidibache true-believers.  If you're not BOTH of those, steer clear of this.  And if you are, this is still a mixed bag.  Overall, I don't consider this a ""great performance"" and it's not one I would be that interested in returning to (unlike Karajan's Bruckner DVD recordings of the 8th and 9th with the VPO, which are outstanding performances).  Yet even still, there are so many things that are wonderful here that one can't call it inconsequential.

The program notes for the DVD indicate this is the slowest performance of Bruckner's 7th Symphony on record.  Coming in at nearly 90 minutes, it's about 20 minutes slower than what many would consider to be a ""leisurely"" performance of this symphony.  Someone once wrote about Bernstein's glacial performance of Tchaikovsky's 6th Symphony, which came in at 60 minutes, that ""if Tchaikovsky had wanted the symphony to be 60 minutes long, he would have written quite a few more notes.""  That sentiment unexpectedly came to mind as I was sitting through this.

Notwithstanding the running time, I have to say that the first, third, and fourth movements worked for me, particularly the first and fourth movements, even if this is not how I want to regularly hear this symphony.  The first movement is performed exceptionally slowly, yet somehow Celidibache makes it work.  The architecture emerges clearly, and I heard things in the performance I had never heard before.  While it was an ""extreme"" approach, it did work.

But I can't say the same for the second movement.  The second movement crashed under the back-breaking weight of Celidibache's glacial speeds.  It lost me.  The second movement could not sustain its 31:25 running time.  Most performances of this movement run anywhere between 23:00 and 26:00 minutes.  It seemed to me that taking it at least a 25% slower speed broke the camel's back.

The third movement was well done even if at a slow speed, but it did sustain itself.  And then a miracle happened--Celibidache started the fourth movement at a normal speed, before quickly slamming the brakes when the second subject appears.  Even though the tempo shift was dramatic, I have to say it didn't feel inorganic, and it did set up the reverential aspects of the 4th movement very effectively.  In fact, I have to say, I thought that Celibidache's interpretation of the fourth movement was pretty darn close to revelatory.

Throughout the performance, I found myself hearing things I had not heard before.  It was interesting in many spots, but on the whole, I found it an interesting although not great performance.  Additionally, I was a bit surprised to hear a relative lack of dynamic contrasts.  The orchestra never really played *that* softly.  Maybe they did and in the concert hall that could very much be heard, but if that's the case, somehow it did not get captured in the recording.  But there are times in the symphony that demand some especially soft playing, and from what I could hear, in this performance those passages didn't get it.  However, the playing of the Berlin Philharmonic is expectedly strong.

So what to make of all this?  If you're sold on both Bruckner AND Celibidache's non-conforming approach to Bruckner, then you'll at the minimum enjoy this performance and perhaps you'll even think of it in stronger terms.  I do think Celibidache is the real deal when it comes to Bruckner and that he has relevant things to say, but on the whole, I don't cosider this a ""great performance"" or one that I would really be that interested in returning to very often, if at all.",1396569600,9,3663,4.886547811993517
8522551,3,B007WB5DAW,"I have all the Bruckner symphonies and oddly, they are much the same.  Oh, the melodies vary, of course, and the themes can be mostly found, but the outstanding aspect of these works is framed around the wondrous brass sections that are called upon often for sonorous sounds that are wondrous in their full throated resonance.  All the symphonies have brass toward which to look and enjoy.  Without this aspect of tonality the works would indeed slip into some much weaker desire to be heard.",1367193600,2,492,4.764705882352941
8522552,5,B007WB5DAW,"This is a superb Bruckner 7th, under the baton of a master Brucknerian.  Celibidache was returning to the orchestra he directed right after the conclusion of World War II, and this performance summarises and epitomises his approach to ""making music."" Certainly, there may be various ways to conduct Bruckner, but here Celi' emphasizes the sinuous, breathing architecture of the work. Every detail is allowed to develop organically, forming a sweeping whole. Despite his longer timing, nothing drags, everything work together. This is a beautiful, moving performance, superbly filmed. Highly recommended.",1359849600,13,603,5.7
8522553,5,B007WB5DAW,"It is interesting to read the one review before mine in that how a hatred toward a certain musician would crook the opinion in that way. Karajan was not all for everything like some of his worshipers would like to believe, but at the same time he was sublime in some. Also he was a supreme orchestra builder. Even though this concert took place a few years after Karajan's parting with the Berlin Philharmonic and ultimately his death, the sound it carries here is still distinctively his orchestra. None of the Celibidache's recordings of the 7th I heard before this one achieved the greatness and I find it ironic that he would attain the truly amazing performance of the symphony using the orchestra trained by his arch-nemesis. It is also apparent here that however wonderful the Munich Philharmonic sounded under Celi with the right resonance, they were no match to the Berlin orchestra during this time. There are other great 7th like Karajan/EMI, Giulini/DG, Asahina/Fontec (in fact, 2 of them), Sanderling/Hnssler, etc.. but this one is transcendental. It should be justifiably called 'legendary.'",1344384000,24,1105,5.043715846994536
8522554,5,B007WB5DAW,"The Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, at the time this concert was performed, was an orchestra that played to the gallery mostly. Louder and faster the better, was the mantra. The Herbert von Karajan 'sound' of bombast and high sheen applied to almost everything they played always relegated the composers intentions to a secondary role. Although the musicians of the orchestra made lots of money during that time, the BPO largely abandoned their legendary leadership role of visionary interpretations. The truly Teutonic music making shifted to the other great German towns, Dresden, Munich and Leipzig. And with the music of Bruckner, there was none greater than Celibidache and the Munich Philharmonic.

Although this performance is no where close to the greatness that Celi and the Munich musicians achieve, this concert with the BPO goes to prove that with the right visionary direction, miracles are posible.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sergiu-Celibidache-Conducts-Bruckner/dp/B007VLHP9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sergiu Celibidache Conducts Bruckner</a>",1343260800,12,1105,6.416107382550336
