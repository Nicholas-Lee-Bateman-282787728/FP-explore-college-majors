8645021,4,B00ISDWTZU,"In this movie (1930), the script of Bess Meredyth and John Howard Lawson describes the amours of three department store girls; Jerry, Connie and Frankie. Connie and Frankie are fun loving girls who throw themselves at rich playboys in an attempt to marry them. Jerry, played by Joan Crawford is the sensible girl and warns them about playboys who are not interested in serious relationship. The girls ignore her and then end up being hurt. This movie is somewhat similar to the highly successful 1953 film ""How to Marry a Millionaire.""

There are a lot of fun instances, and one I particularly liked is when Joan Crawford wears a blonde wig and tests the patience of her suitor played by Robert Montgomery. The fun-loving Anita Page dates Raymond Hackett and Dorothy Sebastian dates John Miljan in this flapper epic. Director Harry Beaumont staged a big fashion parade to make sure that the film is appealing to the female audience just like his 1928 movie, ""Our Dancing Daughters."" I think this is an enjoyable movie and I am sure you will like it too.",1424217600,4,1053,4.754098360655738
8645022,5,B00ISDWTZU,"This film is the final sequel to the 1928 smash hits ""Our Dancing Daughters"" and ""Our Modern Maidens"", the breakthrough films that propelled Joan Crawford into stardom. This film's storyline is far more somber than its 2 predecessors which showcased privileged, jazz age youth of the ""Roaring 20s.  When this film was released in 1930, the Great Depression had already cast a shadow on the frivolities of the Jazz age / Roaring 20's.

""Jerry"" {Joan}, ""Connie"" {Anita Page} and ""Francine"" aka ""Franky"" {Dorothy Sebastian} are sales ladies working at the Jardine Department Store {aka Macy's}  BUT Joan isn't exactly a shop girl, she's a model ""mannequin"" showing the store's {and her own} very fetching female wares. The girls are roommates sharing an apt and expenses. They are looking for love, romance and escape from their humdrum predictable jobs and lives. While working at Jardine's, each will meet a handsome {seemingly} eligible man to spark their romantic interest AND who mirror their personalities in what they are looking for in a relationship.

""Connie"" is looking for romantic love and a ""prince charming"" and is swept her off her feet by ""David Jardine"" {Raymond Hackett} the owner's son - a young, feckless playboy. ""Franky"" wants a man to provide her with lots of money, clothes, excitement and a good time and finds her mirror image in ""Marty"" {John Miljan}  a smooth talking con man /crook flashing a wad of cash ready to provide it - with strings attached of course !!.

Jerry with her feet ""firmly on ground"" is not going to be blinded by the airy promises of romantic love nor is going to be bought or conned by any smooth talking ""Good Time Charlie"". She is attracted to ""Tony Jardine"" {Robert Montgomery} David's older and more responsible brother who likes the ladies but has a decent streak in him which prevents him {despite his wealth and charm} from loving, using, abusing and leaving them. Jerry and Tony are mightily attracted to each other but they are separated by class, social and economic barriers, SO who will betray his /her core beliefs for passionate and perhaps temporary love?

In the course of their relationships each lady will find the type of romance/love that they chose will seem to give them what they wanted for BUT coming at a steep price with passions, misunderstandings, self sacrifice, betrayal, disgrace, death, redemption and vindication all in the mix in how their choices will eventually change their lives.

This is a typical MGM ""Grade A"" quality production with art direction by Cedric Gibbons and the ladies garb designed by Adrian which includes some revealing negligees modeled by Joan at a fashion show. Director Harry Beaumont, a veteran MGM house director competently moves the narrative along.

The supporting cast includes Hedda Hopper as a much married divorcee and Edward Brophy as a fast talking ""would be"" ladies man trying to wangle a date with Jerry no matter how many times she says no !! All the performances are uniformly excellent and Ms. Crawford's is especially good - her character is the moral center of the film and she is wistful and poignant in wanting love but is not willing to sacrifice her self respect to desire. Robert Montgomery is initially smug and snarky but he is more than he appears to be and he match's up well with Joan.

This is an excellent pre-code film with the added bonus of Joan's youthfull beauty {she was 24 at the time} that shows her at her physical peak. This is the best flick {in my opinion} of the trio - a well made, entertaining film with all of the performers giving of their best and I give it a 5 star rating - Recommended .",1414800000,8,3645,4.7990430622009566
8645023,5,B00ISDWTZU,"I have been a fan of this movie since I saw it on TCM when I was 13. I am so thrilled that it is finally on DVD after all of this time! This DVD is a must for any fan of the film. It's not one of Crawford's grittier roles, but it is a comforting movie for a lazy afternoon.",1402531200,3,273,3.4918032786885247
