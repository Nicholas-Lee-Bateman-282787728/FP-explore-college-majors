8044546,5,B00005QB8U,"This series is a very interesting drama. The acting is not over-the-top, nor is it extremely over none. For me, it was very easy to become invested in these characters just to see what would happen in their lives. Yes, There are some events that make you roll your eyes a bit, but overall, a great series.",1469232000,,305,4.368421052631579

8044548,5,B00005QB8U,What a great show.  I watched all five seasons simultaneously.  The characters were written as real people and not just two dimensional stereotypes.  I highly recommend this show to everyone.,1468540800,,191,5.3
8044549,5,B00005QB8U,Season 3 is as addictive as prior seasons. Kudos to both writers and extraordinary actors.,1467072000,,90,5.066666666666666
8044550,5,B00005QB8U,"This was an excellent British drama/comedy series in the 90s set in Manchester England which involved the trials and tribulations of three, 30-something couples and their lives as they progressed through dating, love, marriage, and family.  It disappeared after season 4 in the U.S. and the final season 5 never made it.  You could get Season 1-4 on Netflix but, for some reason, not the concluding season 5.  But now it's available on Amazon.  Thank you Amazon.....after all these years, I finally know how it ended.",1466985600,,517,4.976744186046512
8044551,4,B00005QB8U,"This is an utterly captivating show. A great ensemble of fine actors, excellent writing, and a truly fine bend of comedy and pathos. For rom-com fans, for Brit-com fans and for fans of cracking good storylines, ""Cold Feet"" is must-binge TV.",1464566400,,240,4.878048780487805

8044553,5,B00005QB8U,When is the fourth season coming out?  I've been waiting for more than a year!!  I watched Cold Feet in Bravo and never got a chance to see season 4 and 5.,1146960000,6,155,3.8125
8044554,5,B00005QB8U,"This is an excellent TV series from the UK. It follows the life of three English couples, one newly dating (Adam and Rachel (played by the same actress who played Emily in Friends), who meet in the pilot), one newly married and trying for a child, and one that already has a child and seems destined to end.

The show is great because of the dialogue and the story, and was also compelling to me because the scenery is quite different from anything that we would see in the U.S. (either on TV or in the real world).

The show won an award from the British Academy of Film and Television. It deals with real life issues, including sex, and is probably too open with these issues to air in the U.S. without some censoring. There's actually only one or two scenes in the entire 5 seasons that actually shows any nudity, and its very brief and contextually appropriate (i.e., one involves a woman giving birth and the other a woman who takes a night job at a strip club).

If I had it to do over again, I'd watch series 1, 2, and 3. The show stalls a bit in series 4 and I hated the way the series ended in series 5. But, series 1, 2, and 3 are well-worth buying if only to watch once.

Although I'm writing this review before the release of this DVD, I have actually watched the entire series. I bought them from www.amazon.co.uk and watched them on a DVD player that is capable of playing Region 2 disks. If you are so inclined, there are a number of other good shows that have not been released here, including Teachers and Black Books, which you can buy at amazon.co.uk. In fact, this title is much cheaper (and you can get all 5 seasons) if you buy it on amazon.co.uk. However, in order to view UK DVD's, you must buy a region free dvd player.

You can find one by searching the web for ""Region Free DVD Players."" Amazon also sells the Gateway DVD Recorder and the LiteOn DVD Recorders, which are capable of being made Region Free (check out [...]for instructions) and can play the UK versions without any trouble.

If you like this show, you will also like Teachers and Black Books, which are also available at www.amazon.co.uk.",1124755200,19,2130,4.366161616161616
