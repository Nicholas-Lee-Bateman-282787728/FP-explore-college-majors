7973703,2,B0000714D9,"i agree with the previous reviewer that whoever wrote the 5 star review must know someone in it or been affiliated with the movie.  the acting is absolutely horrible, dialogue bad and characters not likeable.  the computer graphics are pretty cool and that's one of the problems.  the edited in graphic action does not blend in with the live action.  it's like there are two different movies going on.  they should of just did the whole movie animated.  the editing is fair and the ending is poor.  it's also full screen.  overall though it's a good effort for an independent movie.  clearly it took a long time to do with a lot of effort.",1267574400,,639,4.535087719298246
7973704,1,B0000714D9,"Though it's not illegal to outright lie and call this childish, amateurish sci-fi travesty a 5 star movie, it is, at the very least, immoral.  You should be ashamed.",1155772800,,165,4.689655172413793
7973705,5,B0000714D9,"While clearly assembled for little more than pocket change, this bizarre combination of black humor and science fiction is its own category of high art. Superb acting, camera work, and effects easily help the viewer over the occasional ""huh?"" in the wandering storyline. This obviously disturbed filmmaker should be persuaded to make at least one more.",1037491200,8,352,5.303571428571429
