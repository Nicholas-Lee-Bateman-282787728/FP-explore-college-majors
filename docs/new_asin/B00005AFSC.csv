7935348,1,B00005AFSC,Noah's Ark was not on the DVD I was very disappointed.  It was about the government and I didn't ask that.  It just was not on the DVD. Linda,1381104000,,141,3.8275862068965516
7935349,5,B00005AFSC,"The Phenomenon Archive series is one of the best things the world has been given. To see these three outstanding historical videos on one DVD, for this kind of price, is almost too good to be true. Nevertheless, the best things tend to be that way.",1201392000,,248,4.413043478260869
7935350,5,B00005AFSC,"I have all of the Phenomenon DVD's and they are exceptional.

Lavishly produced, very HIGH Quality and extremely intriguing.

Dean Stockwell---a very underated and under appreciated actor brings his star quality talent in at just the right pitch as the Host of the series.

By the way, Check out Hepburn and Stockwell in the timeless film adaptation of Eugene O'Neil's ""Long Days Journey Into Night"" for proof of that statement! One of the great forgotten films!!!!!!

Unfortunately...I cannot remember the name of the man who narrarates the Phenomenon series, but his voice was a stroke of casting genius.

What the inimitable Alexander Scourby did for the Bible...this man...whoever he is...does for this series...

So check out this series if you want to see a surprisingly Professional and Expertly produced Investigative-Documentary Series that covers many subjects of Mystery in a manner that does not de-legitimize the subject itself with a lot of Hooey!

Example....the Noah's Ark segment is possibly one of the most groundbreaking and stunning documentaries that I have ever seen on the subject of Noah's Ark research!

Especially as there is photographic evidence of this amazing earthquake that occured and basically exposed the ribs of an ancient ship at the foot of Arrarat.

What is fascinating about a Series such as this is that they are willing to actually consider and present evidence even when it defies conventional or institutionalized versions of Histories Mysteries.

Yep...for those of us who enjoyed ""In Search Of..."" with Leonard Nimoy back in the 70's and have come to detest all of the conveyor belt shaky camera crap documentaries that Discovery and A&E are putting out these days full of fluff and way to many commercials, then this is a top notch series to get your hands on.

Documentary series just don't come along this good very often.

I wish the legendary Graham Hancock could get together with the folks who made this series and.....oh man would that be a buzz or what!!!!!!!!!!

I would be willing to purchase a documentary just of them talking about the idea of making such a documentary of his ideas and theories with this quality of production....!!

Anyway...this is  Quality and Intrigue at a great price!!!",1110412800,,2252,5.081521739130435
7935351,4,B00005AFSC,"The first of three programs on this dvd is Noah's Ark Found, which follows the discovery of a boat shape object on Mt Ararat which could be the Ark itself, or maybe not. The second episode which is the best of the three is about Tunguska, what really exploded in 1908 over this region which still has no conclusion. Was is a comet, nuclear explosion or a UFO, you decide. Program number 3 is about the cover up of Cosmonaut Vladimir Ilyushin, I didn't know what this cover up was about until I watched this dvd and was amazed at the evidence that the Russians had lied to the world about who really was the first man in space, fascinating episode. All programs run for about 45 minutes each, there are no extras.
