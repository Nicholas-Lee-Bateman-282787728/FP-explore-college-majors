8306615,5,B001GPOU04,"This hour long documentary on the first all-female Mariachi band's formation and growth was fascinating. Live performances are intercut with interviews with many of the band members, each telling her story. The music is gorgeous, and what the women talk about - what it's like being in the band, how each person got started, that there even was one being put together (lots of excitement), being the only women Mariachi band in an all-male Mariachi world, and so on. One of their lead singers was only 14 when she won that spot, and we watch as she gets the call, goes and tries out, then waits to see if she'll win a chair. She does. Her voice is tremendous to say the least, And seeing her sing live is a real treat. The band's leader in the beginning was a caucasian woman. What? Yes - she loves Mariachi music tremendously, and had a great deal of experience playing with other established Mariachi bands, whereas most of the other women had little or no experience. So this situation is also interesting to see in action.
  In ending all I can say is - watch it - and thank you so much,women of the band, for all you've done. You are truly musical pioneers.",1359590400,,1162,4.476415094339623
8306616,2,B001GPOU04,"I was disappointed with the video for different reasons. I imagine it to be one fill with songs and celebrating life. It was not. The video had tinges of a soap opera. Conflicts, not about music but rather personalities, conflicts of visions of what the director Jos Hernandez wanted and what the young musicians wanted from the first female mariachi group. There was suggestions of discrimination against the only anglo in the group. Issues of what is fair pay for a group was just beginning its road to success. We are left in the end with questions of whether the group will succeed not based upon their talent, but rather their lack of cohesiveness.",1290470400,2,653,4.7368421052631575
