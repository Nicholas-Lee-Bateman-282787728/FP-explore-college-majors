8327807,3,B001NRPQKS,"This collection has a healthy dose of Dragnet, Martin Kane and others.  There is a lot of television on these DVDs, and more than once I've decided to do a TV detective marathon but couldn't make it through more than 3 or 4 before I just got worn out with the bad audio and video quality.  These aren't restored - that's why they're inexpensive.  I will say I watch black and white 30s-50s movies all the time, so it's not the black and white or any of that, it's just that they aren't restored.

Overall, I'm glad I bought them and it's fun to pop one in occasionally.",1318896000,,569,4.2407407407407405
