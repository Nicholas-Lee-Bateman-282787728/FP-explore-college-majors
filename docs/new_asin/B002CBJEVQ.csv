8363833,5,B002CBJEVQ,"Very distinct 7.1 surround sound separation. Mahler's Resurection has never sounded so good, except when I heard it performed live by the New York Philharmonic at Avery Fischer Hall in New York.",1362182400,,194,5.09375
8363834,1,B002CBJEVQ,"Looks like Alexander Jero removed all of his poorly-reviewed recordings and re-listed them as new products to wipe out all the 1-star reviews they got. I was one of the unlucky ones tricked into buying this garbage from Acoustic Reality, and I am disappointed that an entire new group of music lovers may be tricked into buying any of these cheap Acoustic Reality Blu-rays, especially at the rip-off prices being charged.

Look at the review history for any 5-star reviews Acoustic Reality products and you'll see a pattern: a cabal of 10-20 people from blu ray dot com who unilaterally support the producer of these sub-par products, Alexander Jero, despite the fact that the recordings do not deliver. The performances are average, the surround experience lacking, and the overall product quality amateurish. From typos on the jacket to the BD-R disc seemingly burned at someone's computer, this is NOT what should be representing the future of Blu-ray audio.

If you look at other Acoustic Reality (which used to be called Surround Records) Blu-rays on Amazon, you'll note that some of the 5-star reviewers use the exact same wording in every review they post for a Jero release. And in many cases, those guys can barely write in English, which is strange.

A lot of these recordings are actually stereo recordings that have been manipulated and remixed as 7.1 DTS surround, and despite the clever attempt, you can't escape the source material.

While Oleg Caetani and the Robert Schumann Philharmonic aren't bad, they're not the stunning reference-standard performances one would expect for a Blu-ray at this price point. The editorial review on Amazon is Jero's and can be taken with a grain of salt. Unfortunately, I was tricked and bought this when it originally was released.

So beware, and just know that this recording (and all the others by Acoustic Reality/Surround Records) do not exemplify the potential of the Blu-ray format for classical music. Let's hope that either Jero finds better orchestras that can record natively in 7.1 DTS HD, or that another company jumps on the bandwagon and releases catalog titles that take advantage of superior recording technique and overall product quality.

If you want a real surround sound Blu-ray of Mahler's 2nd, go buy the 2011 Chailly performance with the the Leipzig Gewandhaus. It's some of the most spectacularly-recorded classical music you've ever heard. And - unlike this audio-only Acoustic Reality Blu-ray - the video of the performance is included in sparkling high definition!",1318809600,12,2545,5.120481927710843
8363835,3,B002CBJEVQ,"Like others have noted, the disk loads as an AVCHD instead of BD.  I'm not an expert in all of the various studio authoring methods out there, but the disk does not visually appear to be a Bluray disk.  The data side of the disk has a deep blue color similar to a blank DVD-R, and not the stamped silver that is common with professionally published disk media.  Also, the label on the disk feels very similar to the etchable Lightscribe disks where the DVD burner can also create the label.  The case booklet looks cheaply printed on thin paper stock.  It too looks like it was printed on a low resolution laser printer.

The sound quality is very good however, and is a DTS HD 7.1 at 96kHz/24 bit as advertised.

So all-in-all the data content is what I expected, but at best this is cheaply published media, at worse a bootleg that somehow got into Amazon's merchant stream.",1310256000,2,876,4.4375
8363836,2,B002CBJEVQ,"Quality of the recorded sound is outstanding.
I personally do not like the interpretation and would not care to hear this recording again.",1296950400,6,138,5.043478260869565
8363837,2,B002CBJEVQ,"I disappointed with this item, this is item is sold as blu-ray but inside of box appear a DVD-R. I wrote to AMAZON to this and they send to me again this item.
By second time when i recive this in inside of box appeared in dvd and not blu-tay.
I don't know why the description of item is referred to a blu-ray.
I do not recommend.",1255737600,8,330,3.9402985074626864
