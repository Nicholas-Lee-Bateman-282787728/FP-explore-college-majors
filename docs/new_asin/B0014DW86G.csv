8255365,2,B0014DW86G,i had previously enjoyed playing the other rock n learn videos for my kids but this was quite different as the video quality was bad from scratch. each story had to be selected manually before it starts playing and there were too many cracks in the storyline as well as the songs played thereafter. it was a huge disappointment.,1364860800,4,328,4.576271186440678
8255366,5,B0014DW86G,"This dvd has 4 different stories & songs that go along w/ the stories. My toddler loves them. The words are typed across the bottom of the screen so they can read along as they hear the words. After much consideration I chose this series over Leapfrog, My Baby Can Read & Hooked on Phonics.",1299369600,4,290,4.290909090909091
