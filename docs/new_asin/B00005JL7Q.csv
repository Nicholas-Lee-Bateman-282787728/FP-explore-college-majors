1443092,5,B00005JL7Q,"Very enjoyable film. A well done comedy as well as an entertaining commentary about modern life. Another very good adaptation of a Nick Hornby novel (see also ""Fever Pitch"" and ""High Fidelity""). Hugh Grant is brilliant as Will, and it is a refreshing change from many of his previous movie roles. I prefer watching him play the handsome cad rather than the bumbling nice guy (v.boring).",1030233600,,386,4.863636363636363
1443093,5,B00005JL7Q,"This clever comedy makes you laugh, warms your heart, and brings a huge smile to your face when it's over.  It pleasantly surprises you with its smart humor.  Hugh Grant is wonderful, as well as the other cast members.  I haven't loved a movie this much in a long time.  I recommend it to everyone.",1028073600,,298,4.363636363636363
1443173,5,B00005JL7Q,"I think this is one of Hugh Grant's best movies. It has the right amount of humor and drama to be compelling and entertaining. There is good growth from the characters and the movie leaves you feeling good at the end. I personally am tired of all the dark movies all the time. This isn't for everyone though. The main character is a bit of a cad lying to women to get them into the sack, but if that isn't moraly abrasive for you, then you should find this very entertaining.",1504310400,,475,4.230769230769231

1443176,4,B00005JL7Q,"Wonderful script by Nick Hornsby.  This stars Hugh Grant who is a trust fund baby whose empty life is filled with childish pursuits until he crosses paths with a young boy who is the target of bullies. It's kind of a schmaltzy relationship but the two of them bring out the best in each other and, of course, the ending is happy.

1443179,4,B00005JL7Q,"Possible spoilers.  This charming film from directing brothers, Paul and Chris Weitz received an Oscar nomination along with co-writer Peter Hedges for best adapted screenplay in 2003.

Hugh Grant is at the top of his game as 30-something Will Freeman.  Hes a bit of a playboy and has never worked a day in his life.  He receives a generous stipend from the royalties of a Christmas song written by his late father.  He has a modest but cool apartment in London.  Hes quite the ladies man but his relationships never last more than a few weeks.  He decides it would be a good idea to date a woman who is also a single parent.  He goes to one of those single parent gathering and meets an attractive woman named Suzie (Victoria Smurfit).

Will pretends he has a 2-year old son.  He sets up a date with Suzie where they will go to the park and have a picnic.  He expected her young son (his is with the fictional kids mum) but she also brings along a 12-year old boy named Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) who is the son of one of her friends, Fiona (Toni Collette).  Marcus has been having a hard time at school because heswell, weird.  The way he dresses and acts and he will occasionally burst out in song.  Even the nerds stay away from him.  Hes constantly bullied.  Part of the problem is that he has no father figure (can you see it coming?) and his mother, Fiona is in deep depression and suicidal.  In fact she just barely survives thanks to the picnicking quartet finding her after bringing Marcus home.

Marcus may be odd but hes not stupid and he discovers Wills sham of using the idea of a having a kid just to shag the mommies.  So he blackmails him.  He won't tell if Will if he will let him hang out with him at his apartment.  Mostly they just watch a game show, then Marcus heads for home.  But they begin to connect.  If fact, Marcus is often more adult than Will.  Marcus hopes that Will will connect with his mum, but shes just a bit too wacky for Will and she also makes a point that shes not interested in him (kidding right?).  This leaves an opening late in the film for Will to fall for Rachel (Rachel Weisz) who is also a single mom of a 12-year old boy.  And Will falls for her.  While Will doesnt technically lie to her, he suggests that he is kind of a foster father to Marcus.  Marcus goes with it, but she will of course find out.

The filmmakers use voice-over thoughts of Will and Marcus throughout the film.  Its very effective.  This film is hilarious at times and smile inducing when you're not laughing.  It has moments of warmth, but it never gets too sappy.  Recommended.",1501891200,2,2600,4.327800829875518
1443180,3,B00005JL7Q,"Not a huge Hugh Grant fan as I've tired quickly of his cutesy, eccentric expressions and his silly personal real life antics but admittedly this is one of his better films, but considering I give it only 3 stars is an indication of what drek Hugh normally churns out. I did laugh a few times. I found much of the dialogue difficult at best to understand with the english accents, especially from the depressed mother and her son. I did some fast-forwarding through the grade school break dancing/rap crap junk. That crapola is everywhere these days and I don't subject myself to any of it. I either change the channel or fast forward through it.",1501718400,,645,4.6173913043478265

1443443,3,B00005JL7Q,"The movie adaption of About a Boy isn't necessarily awful, but it does take a lot of liberties. I have a few minor complaints and one very very large complaints, followed by what I did enjoy about the movie.

Minor Complaints:
1. Angie isn't introduced to Will by his friend Christine. He meets Angie by talking to her accidentally because he thinks she is Fiona, who he overheard at a record shop earlier that day.
2. Suzie is a bit sparse in the film. Will actually tries to go after her a good deal before finally meeting Marcus. I assume she was cut down due to run time.
3. Ellie is cut waaay down. Ellie helps Macus come out of his shell in the book. Their relationship might be the most complex and important to the story and she barely gets a few scenes with him.
4. The kid playing Alistair is awful. His voice makes me want to eat chemicals.
5. For some reason the musician that Marcus gets into in the movie is Mystikal, of 'shake ya ass' fame. In the book however, Will introduces Marcus to Nirvana. Maybe the change happened because the book was written in the time frame around Kurt Cobain's suicide and the movie's timeline is later. Not sure where Mystikal comes from though.
6. Rachel's character breaks up with Will and then gets back together with him in the movie after the talent show. The book however shows that Rachel is a little more pragmatic and forgiving of Will's misstep. She stays with him after he comes clean and the movie and book ends pretty much the same after that point.

Now for the major plot change:
The entire third act of the movie is different. Instead of Marcus visiting his father with Ellie, having a realization that Ellie is a bit of a mess and having a group chat with his mom, Will, and his dad, Marcus enters a talent show. The last act of the book was very important. Marcus' view on relationships changes and you see him finally let go of his naivety. He notices that no one has their life in order and that everyone is pretty much making it up as they go along. In the movie, he joins the talent show because his mom mentions briefly in the film that his voice puts happiness in her heart. So he thinks that if he sings for her that she will get better and not want to kill herself again. Will joins him on stage. They make a mess of it, laughter ensues, boooo hollywood ending. The talent show undercuts the great ending of the book.

The one redeeming factor in the movie is  Hugh Grant as Will. He plays all his parts great - smarmy, alarmed, desperate, angry, charismatic, and goofy. His lines are very well delivered and he can turn a dull scene into something great by adding an emphasis on the right word. His performance really stands out.",1435104000,,2702,4.376494023904383

1443492,5,B00005JL7Q,"It is not a story for a little kids. This is totally adult movie and do follow the rating advice. Other then that
this is very good performance by all actors involved especially Hugh Grant ,t he little boy and his mom.

It is very real on screen depiction of a young guy who has enough money to live care free but
at the same he is lonely enough to submit to uninvited friendship with a little boy and his slightly
psychotic but more struggling single mom and although the movie is not about any romantic
relationship with his mom as there is no such, this movie is hilarious and good visual journey
that is good watch.
It is slightly intellectual movie and extremely satisfying.

Don't expect fast action or special effects but if you want great smooth dialogues and

1443532,5,B00005JL7Q,"This is arguably one of my all time favorite movies:  genuine praise from me as I usually don't like what initially comes off as light, cheesy humor. I am SO happy I stayed for this unique treat of a film the first time I stumbled upon it on tv. I then found myself watching it *every* time it was on--each time getting more and more out of  the story line.
It's a surpisingly deep and moving movie with a multi-layered message. The humor eases the tension a bit  in the ways in which  dysfunction plays out in different types of lifestyles.
Toni Collette plays a troubled but loving and devoted mum to a smart quirky boy who is bullied at school. She  suffers from periodic depression, sometimes severe..and soooo many movies get that delicate subject totally wrong!

 Hugh plays a rich, often bored, self absorbed guy who ""has it all"" yet really has nothing because he instinctively needs love and connection in his life.

The worlds of Marcus, the sweet, adorable outcast who is confused by his mother but devoted to her; and this vain playboy Will collide, and leads to a heartwarming yet non corny conclusion. (Another Hollywood rarity).

I TRULY enjoy and respect this movie.

Newcomer Nick Hoult is brilliant. Hugh Grant largely carries the film but keeps one step back, and Toni Collette isn't recognized half as much as she should be as an actress. She was phenomenal in this vehicle and shines in EVERY film I have ever seen her in. Rachel Weisz was charming in the role of one of Will's conquests.

I now own the director's cut dvd and have watched it over and over. SO rare to see a movie which is entirely human and doesnt have to rely on sex or violence or gratuitous cursing. The movie doesnt even require everyone to look like a supermodel. All players are nuanced and delightfully flawed. The London background was a perfect backdrop (often gray and rainy).

Oh. And the soundtrack is AWESOME. I purchased that too!",1422662400,,1932,4.616959064327485

1443638,5,B00005JL7Q,"Hugh Grant lives the life of a rich wastrel from money his late father made after writing one world wide used Christmas tune. He has a soft posh life in London. He is such a slacker that dating single moms is for him the ideal of way of meeting his carnal needs. The boy's mother is one of those women. Unfortunately, she is also depressed and a potential suicide. Her son has been doggedly keeping her alive by wit and will power and will not let Grant get away. Although Grant tries to get shut of him, the boy eventually forces him to get involved in his life and thus his own.

Although Grant can be screamingly funny in this as the guy who has never done a worthwhile thing in his life, his coming to care for this boy and therefore becoming a worthwhile person are a fine dramatic turn as well. That's why I consider this Grant's best film. Grant's comedic timing, always precise, is razor sharp here.

There is also a romance element to the film as he meets a character played by Rachel Weisz. Initially he uses the boy in order to convince Weisz she should consider him as a boyfriend. But in this subterfuge, he gradually does begin to care and for both.

This is based upon the novel written by Nick Hornby. Hornby is an English novelist whose books always seem to be made into quite good films. Most novelists are not this fortunate.

1443639,5,B00005JL7Q,"I had never heard of this film....just pulled it off the shelf of the public library.  I'm not a big fan of any of the cast...Hugh Grant, Toni Collette or Rachel Weisz.  And I didn't like Bridget Jones' Diary as much as a lot of people did.  And I disliked Notting Hill.  So. what a surprise!..Somehow this combination of story, directors and actors really came through to produce a wonderful film!  As much as I didn't want to like Grant, probably because of his reputation, I found myself loving him. Besides being over-the-top charming, he is a very very good actor!  Toni Collette never seems very sympathetic to me but here she was just right for the part..  Perhaps it was the genius of the costume designer that endeared her character to me....!  The red hat, the fuzzy sweater....perfect!  The directors took a chance on the young actor who plays The Boy.  He had never done a lot of work and he was going to carry half of this film.  Fortunately he is a natural.  For one thing he isn't cute...he looks just like a nerdy 11 year which is what he plays.  He and Grant play off each other perfectly!  Rachel Weisz (is she relaied to to the directors?) has a fairly small role but she looks great.

The directors strike just the right balance between pathos and humor.  It seems like a fine line to walk but they succeed perfectly. They also avoid over sentimentality, much to the relief of thisviewer.  It could have been a saccharine mess.  Casting Grant in the lead helped to avoid that. When it was over I wondered why I had never heard of this until now. It's a deceptively simple story  but it's so well done that it deserves bravos and a very wide audience..",1411171200,2,1671,4.455445544554456

1443685,4,B00005JL7Q,"Of the books Ive read recently, I liked About a Boy best.  I have to review it in the context of the movie and the recent television series, neither of which came up to the quality and standard of the book.  I discovered the book through the recent NBC television series.  Ive been watching a lot of comedies, and the trailers for About a Boy looked very funny.  Of the three, the TV show is the worst.  The characters are very two-dimensional and do not ring true.  The mother is especially weak, which was my opinion before seeing the movie and/or reading the book.

The TV show caught my interest enough for me to check both the book and the movie out of the library.  The British-American movie was much better than the TV show.  The characterization was truer, especially the mother.  Hugh Grant was not quite as good as David Walton as Will, but the movie held together and was much better than the TV show has been so far.

I don't think Ive ever read a book after seeing both a movie and a TV series before. The reviews of the book were good and several people had read the book after seeing the movie, so I thought Id give it a try.  Im so glad I did because the book is great.  As usual with books, it included so much more detail.  The thought processes of both Will and Marcus added a lot to the story.

1443721,5,B00005JL7Q,"This is one of those rare instances when the product outshines expectations.  I purchased ""About a Boy"" out of deference to Nicholas Hoult (I believe this was his first major feature), who has grown into one of the most fascinating young actors in film today.  I expected a self-indulgent Hugh Grant too-cute film with Hoult as a bonbon, but instead watched an imaginative, charming and thought-provoking story of complex human emotions.
  Hoult is an extremely eccentric kid tormented by other children while struggling to cope with his single hippie mother's depression and attempted suicide.  The mother/son relationship is complex and atypical, breaking personal ground; she has no idea how her doting attention and unconscious efforts to make her son into a partner rather than a child affect him adversely.  Likewise, Grant's self-centered rich-boy-growing-old has a lot of room for improvement, which is ultimately stimulated by his unexpected, unwanted relationship with the awkward but doughty boy.
  The plot is simple:  A horny single dude realizes he can meet vulnerable women among self-help groups for single parents.  He signs up for meetings in which he is the only male, fabricates a non-existent child with all the phony emotional duress of an equally non-existent failed marriage, and wins the hearts of all around him.  He hones in on one attractive mother and while he initially scores with her, the son of the messed-up hippie mom hones in on him as a surrogate father to help him cope with his mother's disabilities.
  Grant's cold-hearted cad is not immediately melted by the irritating boy who insistently shows up at his door and insinuates himself into his home.  But as he realizes the torture the child endures, which may reflect the callowness he showed to others when he was young, he very gradually accepts responsibility for love.
  I recommend this movie on many levels, excellent acting being only one.  It's a feel-good movie that doesn't offer pat, simplistic resolutions, and ultimately is immensely touching (albeit occasionally cringe-worthy).",1395878400,5,2083,5.244712990936556

1443793,5,B00005JL7Q,"I was browsing for something light and charming to watch over the holidays and realized I had not only missed this movie at the time of its theatrical release but had also confused it with the awful Love Actually.

I'm so glad I watched it. The story revolves about a completely shallow and self centered bachelor who becomes a surrogate father to a lonely boy, [ a wonderful performance by Nicholas Hoult] . I didn't read the book, have no idea how the movie  compares, but  I actually found myself laughing out loud in several parts. The boy is so touching, so wise and sweet in having to hold up the burden of being his depressed hippie mother's [ another great performance by Toni Colette] much humiliated son.

The parts with Colette and Hugh Grant [ as the bachelor] are just about perfect and Grant's dating duplicities are hilarious. The script only falters with the arrival of perfect girl Rachel Weitz, who becomes the catalyst for Grant's evolution. Personally, I wish her character had been a bit quirkier but there you go. [ Though to the writer's credit her son had all the markings of a serial killer in training, despite her noblest efforts].

Still relevant, very funny and totally enjoyable.",1388275200,,1209,4.710900473933649

1443876,3,B00005JL7Q,"Although a definite improvement over some of the studio's prior projects, About a Boy still has a cold, dead, and crude heart that believes the general public's desire is to love a womanizing deadbeat like this film's 'hero,' Will.

Living life as simply and pleasurably as he can (which includes always looking 'hot,' and hitting up every single woman on the street for date and evening sex), Will has a real problem. He's shallow. He's not as much of a chick magnet as he used to be. And... he has a plan. Realizing that divorced women with kids are somewhat easier to manipulate, he decides to masquerade as a jilted husband and father with a made-up toddler, all in the prospect of finding new ground. He hooks up with a pretty young woman at the single parents' meetings, but their one date falls flat when she insists on bringing her best friend's kid Marcus along. The youngster is too smart for his own good, but sadly in need of a good influence. Unfortunately, Will isn't the right influence on his life and the film takes a hair-raising turn when they return home to find Marcus' mom unconscious from an attempted suicide.

Marcus likes Will and attempts to set her up with his mom, whom Will befriends first superficially, but then more deeply when he realizes that she truly needs help. In a humorous twist, Marcus learns that Will is only pretending to be married and a father, and uses this against the 'would-be dad' to gain his own advantage. In the meantime, Will is beginning to fall for Rachel, a single mom in their group. Not as a future sexual prospect or a one-night stand. As a real person. The only problem is that she believes Marcus is Will's son... and he can't fess up. Although the film has a good heart and the selfish Will does improve with time, About a Boy is a rocky, often cynical and uncomfortable ride through what could more accurately be called About a GIRL. Perhaps the story isn't really about Will at all, but more accurately, about Marcus... and single mothers. Taking such an offensive standpoint as looking at divorced and single mothers as future sexual prospects doesn't do a great deal to endear Will to the average viewer. Some, like myself, will be downright offended. The film also flirts on the serious side with a manic-depressive mom who is suicidal. The only bright spot in the film is the kid. Marcus has a crush on a girl at school, and despite Will's interest in whether or not the kid wants to get physical, he merely replies that he just wants to talk with her. Nothing else is necessary. Surprised, Will waves it off... but later comes to the same conclusion about Rachel. The kid also pushes honesty in relationships and encourages Will to be truthful with himself.

Will eventually sacrifices his own reputation for the greater good, but this won't be enough redeeming content to send many teens flocking to the theater. In fact, the good pales in the evidence of the bad... sexual content and profane language. Violent content is limited, although bullies torment Marcus at school. He also accidentally (but cruelly) kills a duck at the park by beaning it with a loaf of bread. Language is the next biggest problem, mounting in two f-words along with many British alternatives that mean the same thing; abuse of Jesus, Christ, and God's name is heavy, along with many minor profanities and crudities, including a running gag that involves a song with 'ass' in the title. The most alarming aspect of the hordes of disgusting language is that most pop out of Marcus' mouth. This Boy needs his mouth washed out with soap.

Next comes the sexual content, which is used more in dialogue than anything else. Will is forever making sexually-oriented comments, both in mouth and mind. He looks at a porn site (implied), talks about his anatomy, and one of his girlfriends suggestively straddles and kisses him. The worst moment of the film that should make all of the women in the audience throw their popcorn at this lousy rat is when he's asked to stand as godfather for a little girl. Callously he says that wouldn't be a good idea, since when she eventually turns eighteen he will probably take her out, get her drunk, and possibly sleep with her. What good lessons they have are awash in disgusting content and sadly worldly views of love. About a Boy isn't really about a boy at all... it's more a vision of what our society has become. And it's a sad one.",1363824000,2,4420,4.648337595907928

Markus is a bright, candid and colorful youth with three strikes against him, a doting mother, unfashionable clothes/home haircut, and a mildly quirky mannerism  - the perfect storm for school bullying. Even the nerds won't be seen with him due to the negative attention he draws. Markus meets self absorbed Will (Hugh Grant), who lives off royalties from his deceased father, after Will tries to pick up Markus' mom's best friend at a SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together) meeting. The isolated Markus latches on to Will who reluctantly and in spite of himself begins to care about the boy.

One thing I love about this movie is that it doesn't provide easy fixes to the big problems Markus faces like being bullied and living with a severely depressed parent, but portrays in a realistic way his struggles to cope and find happiness just the same.",1316563200,4,1298,4.78125
1443995,5,B00005JL7Q,"About A Boy is about two separate lives. That of Will, an egotistical 30 year old who doesn't care about anyone but himself. And that of Marcus, a lonely 12 year old boy who's mother is a serious suicidal woman. The movie is mainly about how these two meet, interact, and change each other's lives. Essentially, Marcus teaches Will that it's not to late to grow up, and Will teaches Marcus it's OK to be a kid at times. About A Boy is easily one of my favorite movies, and never fails me when I'm looking for something light and funny, but also a little deep. The jokes never get old, and it's just an all around good movie, and really makes you feel good along with it. Truly a Great Film!",1313452800,2,690,4.234848484848484

Not precisely a romantic comedy, the film mixes a genuine sweetness and humanity with just the right dose of unsentimental reality to prevent it from becoming formulaic or saccharine. The cast is uniformly strong: Hoult convinces as the sweet but not traditionally cute kid, and I have always liked Toni Collette. As for Grant... I generally prefer him whenever he's playing a bit of a cad, as he does here. (Grant has always seemed a bit liberated whenever he's not stuck as the `aw, shucks' romantic lead). By the end of the film, the characters haven't had sudden and conveniently scripted epiphanies as they might have in some lesser, more formulaic comedies, but they do seem to have evolved as human beings.

The supporting characters are decent as is the film's ending but the writing is what really makes this film. My only issue was that Collete's character (Marcus' mother), was too overbearing and her depressive monologues/crying got old very quickly.

1443999,3,B00005JL7Q,"I usually refrain from comparing movies and/or television shows to the books that they are based on. I make an exception when it becomes clear that the producers and/or director are deviating from the story not for artistic purposes or for purposes of condensing a work to fit into about 2 hours (give or take). This is one such exception. Almost every deviation from the book is a cheap attempt to dumb down the story and to pander to more contemporary audiences (the book is set in the mid-90s...which may as well be the dark ages, as far as these folks are concerned).

This is the story of a young man who, after a series of foibles, ends up spending time with an adolescent boy and they both end up changing each others lives in unexpected ways.

Marcus (the boy) is meant to be depicted as utterly clueless when it comes to contemporary pop culture and trends. In the book, Hornby uses Marcus's lack of awareness of Nirvana and Kurt Cobain as a key point to establish this fact. In the movie, the makers decided to update Kurt Cobain with some random hip-hip artist to change with the times. Ordinarily, this wouldn't be a big issue but for the fact that Cobain killed himself, sparked a general feeling of malaise and despair among his largely teenage audience, and then set into motion the events that build up to the conclusion of the story. When you take away Cobain, you need to rewrite the penultimate act of the story...and the writers of this film did...just not in a way that felt organic.

The end result (of this and other changes) is that the story suffers, the depiction of Marcus suffers, and a great book turns into an enjoyable, but average, film.

Bottom line: Decent and fun movie, Hugh Grant is well cast, but a pale imitation of the original story.",1297728000,6,1774,4.551724137931035

It's a wonderful ""coming of age"" story which is good to watch with a tweener or a teen. The language and innuendo are only slightly crude are very scarce.",1297209600,,739,4.401459854014599

1444002,5,B00005JL7Q,"Quite possibly Hugh Grant's best ever performance, About a Boy is both funny and enticing.

There's two elements to the storyline.

The most obvious one (and the one I honestly believed would dominate most of the storyline but I was wrong) deals with Hugh Grant playing the role of a single guy who's always interested in meeting women, and seems to be proud of the fact he has no life or any real motivation to do anything.  Somehow, he always impresses the ladies and they don't seem to care about the fact he does nothing but sits around watching television all day.

The next part of the storyline is the superior one because it involves Grant's character getting to know a little boy who continues to visit him.  We actually get to see a good chunk of the little boys character and all his many problems (constantly getting picked on in school, having other kids throw rocks at him while returning home, and a constant need to fit in by listening to rap music).

Actually the message I got out of the film is that, you have a grown 38-year old man with no life, and a little kid struggling to get through school and meet friends.  The message being, no matter what the age, your life is probably going to be stuck in a rut at *some* point.

The humor came whenever Hugh Grant would lie as a way to try and impress the ladies.  One scene in particular was great the way he just made up the fact he had a younger son and when the truth was revealed, he just blew it off like it was no big deal.

Overall, it's got comedy elements, and a messgae that displays honesty and maybe even familiarity too.  Some guys can relate to this storyline I bet.",1294790400,2,1648,4.335504885993485

1444036,4,B00005JL7Q,"The iconic Hugh Grant stars as Will in this pleasant British comedy about a man who does 'nothing' in his life.  Nothing except spend money, bed women, lives in a fabulous apartment, and drives a very nice car.  He's living on the royalties of his fathers novelty song, ""Santa's Sleigh"".  He loathes the song, by the way, because it's sappy and he's heard it a million times (or more).

Will, for some reason, starts to have a hard time finding willing women he can have an affair with, and then get rid of them by having them dump him.  His latest fling is a beautiful woman who has a child. After she dumps him (conveniently), Will decides to attend a 'SPAT' (Single Parents Alone Together), because he thinks he's hit a gold mine.  Women who are lonely, sexually hungry, and have a great excuse to dump him after a short while.  So he makes up a two year-old named Ned.

Well, he does end up with a boy, Marcus, who is 12 and is having problems fitting in at school, where hardly anyone wants to hang with him, since his mom walks him to school, and he has a strange habit of just singing out loud without knowing it.  Marcus has a sad-sack mom, Fiona who seems on the verge of suicide every time we see her.  Marcus decides that Will might be a good guy to hang around with; Will isn't too sure.

Recommended.  I liked the film; it portrays a self-admitted shallow guy in the person of Will, together with those around him who want him to (finally) grow up.  With the help of Marcus, he finally does, risking his dignity and emotions with Marcus, his mother, and Christine, an attractive woman he might want to stay with for a while.",1278115200,,1637,4.363036303630363

1444040,5,B00005JL7Q,"When I first saw `About a Boy' I found myself slightly underwhelmed.  I wanted to like it and knew that I was supposed to, but I just didn't really care.  That was a few years ago.  Then, about a year ago, I caught it on cable and, while I only caught the last half, I found myself wrapped up in it.

Then I bought it.

Now I love it.

This is definitely a film that has grown on my ridiculous amounts and I now consider it one of the best of 2002, definitely top ten and at times I even consider it top 5 (I so wish I was still doing my awards, but then again, I'm glad I'm not).  It has so much depth to it, if you are willing to give it the time of day.  It can, and does at times, appear to be just another romantic comedy, and it does have those elements (thank you Rachel Weisz), but there is so much more here than just a generic `boy meets girl'.  The main point of this story is self awareness, and it is handled in such a fun and beautifully touching way.

That `Killing Me Softly' finale just hits me where it counts.

The film tells of selfish womanizer Will who preys on single mothers by attending single parent groups.  It's at one of these groups that he meets young Marcus, who is in serious need of some male attention.  His mother, Fiona, is a bit unstable (or a lot unstable) and somewhat suicidal, and her chronic depression is almost too much for Marcus.  So, after making the first move, Marcus ends up finding a companion in Will.  Will, who is quite aware that he is shallow and self consumed, is stunned that he is finally putting someone else's feelings above his own; but of course that is a life change that will not come easy.

Hugh Grant is a great comedian and has proven himself numerous times for me.  I was not sold on him entirely a few years ago, but over time he has really grown on me.  From his priceless pairing with Bullock to his nomination worthy performance in `Four Wedding and a Funeral', not to mention memorable and charming turns in fluff films like `Music and Lyrics' (such a cute albeit forgettable film), Grant has really perfected his charm.  This is his finest moment, easy.  He is funny and charming and even a tad sleazy, but he manages to capture this man's heart and convey this feeling of want and vulnerability that really helps sell this movie to the audience.  Toni Collette is really good, but I do feel as though love for this performance in particular is a little overrated.  She is wonderful always, but she isn't breathtaking here.  I preferred Rachel Weisz.  Young Nicholas Hoult is just `pinch me' cute here, you just want to give him a gigantic hug and tell him everything will be all right.

Like I said, that `Killing Me Softly' scene is just a tearjerker.

So, in the end I'm gushing.  Give this one a try if you haven't, and if you have and you're still not sure then watch it again.  One of the most beautiful lessons in life is to love and accept yourself, and sometimes it takes a child to teach an adult how to do that.",1256256000,2,2998,4.258407079646018

Each learns from the other and the script is excellent in keeping those two POVs in perfect balance, including Voice Over Narration from both that is among the most skilful use of Voice Over ever.  The climax departs from Nick Hornby's novel for understandable reasons - the original is too low key and too complicated - but in going after the usual Working Title movie big finish (private emotion in a public setting) opts for a huge contrivance in which a rush of emotion almost carries us past its unbelievability.

1444076,5,B00005JL7Q,"Will (Hugh Grant) is a single man always on the hunt for the next girl. His longest relationship he's really ever been in is 2 months. And that's ok for him. It's exactly how he wants it. Because to him, every man is an Island. One day, one of his dates tells him she has a 3 year old kid, and of course Will is horrified with this, but he goes on with it anyways. Will then finds out she's really into sex, so then Will decides to start dating single moms. But he has no clue how to find them until one day he comes across a flyer for single parents get together. So he decides to make up a child and then go to this meeting. He of course meets a lady there and they go on a date in the park, but Will's `son is visiting his mom right now' so he couldn't bring him along. But she brings her kid and also her friend's kid, Marcus (Nicholas Hoult).

Marcus is the total opposite of Will. He's a little nerdy and weird. Can't dress `popular' and really just doesn't fit in. Even the nerds at school don't want to hang with him. And honestly, Marcus really doesn't care, because he is who he is. Marcus's mother is a nut job, but she does love him, even though she really doesn't know him like she thinks she does. So after the date, Will and his date, take Marcus home to find an upsetting event that effect Marcus pretty deeply. The only way to cope with what's happened is to talk to Will, because Marcus thinks they are friends now because Will said `See ya later', which Marcus take to heart.

Together, they both begin to learn from one another. This part is pretty is pretty clich, but it really works because the two are both really likeable. I laughed quite a lot through the whole movie. Hugh Grant is just hilarious and the character of Marcus is just so innocent and loving that you can't help but either say `awww' or kinda laugh at the things that happen to him. He just ignores it mostly and never fights back. I don't know... writing it down just seems kind of upsetting, but you just have to see it I guess. Because kids are really just cruel as most of us know. The dialogue in the movie is great also. I love how Hugh Grant is just straight forward, which is kind of how I am like. He just tells it like it is, because honestly, how will someone really know and understand if you beat around the bush. The scene where he's arguing with Marcus's mom in the restaurant felt, to me, so good because I was thinking exactly the same thing. And another great thing about this moment is the narration from Will and Marcus. It was done really well and was sometimes very funny or very insightful. That was a great touch to me.

In the end, I would say own this movie. I've seen it a lot and I still laugh a lot at it. It is a really funny and nice movie. Definitely one of those `feel good' movies.

1444079,5,B00005JL7Q,"The concept is simple. An avaricious male pretends that he has a son in order to meet women and yet ends up becoming a parental figure for a young boy. Although this is ""About a Boy"" in a nutshell, the Weitz brothers' motion picture deals with the sobering topics of suicide and single parenting while infusing comedy to highlight the importance of relationships. This Oscar nominated film is a piece of entertainment that provides an interesting perspective on the realities of life.

  Hugh Grant stars as the shallow Will Lightman in the film adaptation of Nick Hornby's novel About a Boy. An aging London bachelor, Will prides himself on being free of all commitments and believes that all men are islands. Never having worked a day in his life, Will lives comfortably off the royalties of his father's one hit wonder, ""Santa's Super Sleigh."" Self-indulgences like playing pool, watching television, and taking a bath fill up the units of his day. Newcomer Nicholas Hoult delivers a breakout performance as the 12-year-old outsider Marcus who is frequently bullied and does not have any true friends. Marcus is willing to do anything to make his depression prone mother Fiona smile; even commit social suicide. Wearing mustard-colored corduroy pants and a rainbow sweater, Marcus sings ""Killing Me Softly,"" Fiona's favorite song, during a school talent show. Engrossed in her own problems, Fiona is clueless about her only son's misery.

  The plot is set in motion when Will creates a fictional son named Ned in order to attend SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together) meetings and meet women. The SPAT mothers are the epitome of what Will has been searching for- thirsty for passion, but unready to commit to a relationship again. While dating one of the members, Will meets Marcus at a SPAT picnic. Upon arrival home, Marcus finds Fiona unconscious on the floor after a suicide attempt. She is revived and returns to normal life, but Marcus is never certain that she will still be there by the end of the day. Convinced by Fiona's instability that he needs another parental figure, Marcus sets his mother and Will up on a date, which fails miserably. Despite this, Marcus follows Will and manipulates the bachelor into spending time with him by threatening to expose the secret of Will's invention of Ned. Convinced that caring for another person is the last thing that he wants to do, Will realizes, over the course of the film, that Marcus is the only facet in his life of true value.

  American brothers Chris and Paul Weitz managed to produce a heartfelt creation in the course of their third directorial venture. Before ""About a Boy,"" the Weitz brothers had only previously directed the poorly reviewed ""American Pie"" and ""Down to Earth."" The brothers decided to experiment with the camera to incorporate more artistic shots than they had in their previous spineless works. As Marcus walks towards the camera during one of the scenes, the air is thick and distorted much like the air above a fire. The effect was accomplished by placing a burner underneath the lens and results in making this child appear threatening. Another interesting shot is when Will is shown walking in the opposite direction of everyone else like a fish swimming upstream. His avoidance of all responsibility and rejection of forming relationships makes him unlike the rest of humanity. The use of different color palettes helps the audience to better understand the characters. Will is associated with cool colors like blue and gray. His apartment is sleek and modern but also comes across as being unfriendly and absent of life because it is comprised of these muted tones. Marcus' house incorporates vibrant shades of color giving it a more cluttered and bohemian feel. Filled with material items, Will's flat reflects his shallowness. By the end of the film, the focus shifts from these objects to the people he has formed relationships with as they all gather in his home for Christmas. Novice directors Paul and Chris Weitz managed to fashion Hornby's novel into a genuinely meaningful and heartfelt film.

  At the directors' request, Damon Gough, who is better known as the mastermind behind Badly Drawn Boy, agreed to score ""About a Boy."" Scoring this film was an interesting career move for Gough because he had just previously won the United Kingdom's coveted Mercury Prize for his first full-length album, The Hour of Bewilderbeast. The majority of recording artists generally record a follow-up album after their debut, but Damon Gough went in a completely different direction and tried his hands at scoring by writing original music for the Weitz brothers' film instead. Best described as folk-rock music, Badly Drawn Boy's melodic soundtrack harmonizes perfectly with the motion picture. ""A Minor Incident"" is heard when Marcus returns from the hospital and finds Fiona's suicide note addressed to him. This is the most moving and harrowing song in the movie because the lyrics function as the letter being read aloud. Damon Gough's music compliments the emotions of the scenes while still managing to stand on its own as a beautiful work of art.

  I would highly recommend this film to anyone. Hugh Grant strays from his quintessential role as the charming love interest and is portrayed as a greedy and withdrawn jerk in this movie. His character does not have any relationships because he believes that if people can make you feel better, then they can also hurt you. Marcus shows Will that the risk is worth taking because human connections are what make life worth living.  By the end of the film, Will has finally matured emotionally and realizes the eternal truth that no man is an island. A great movie with a positive message, ""About a Boy"" reminds us that authentic affluence is found in relationships.",1226361600,4,5812,4.9762886597938145

1444082,4,B00005JL7Q,"Not surprisingly, this film feels and unfolds similarly to its cinematic sibling, High Fidelity. Based on John Cusack and Jack Black's outstanding and often hilarious performances in that film, I'd have to say it solidly scores a 5 star rating, and About a Boy, while good, is more of a 4 1/2. About a Boy drags a little at times, isn't quite as overtly humorous, occasionally seems muddled and unsure of its direction or ultimate destination, and leaves poor Toni Colette's character hanging while wrapping things up nicely for everyone else.

Faults aside, About a Boy is refreshingly quirky, honest, and life affirming. Hugh Grant is utterly believable as Will, an aging slacker with a trust fund and uber-cool pad but no friends or fun or reason to get out of bed in the morning. He decides to try to pose as a single dad in order to date single moms in a self-help group, and somehow falls into a cross-generational friendship with an outwardly nerdy but inwardly awesome pre-teen named Marcus. Of course eventually Hugh meets a cute lass and after predictable misunderstandings they finally get together, but in the meantime, the relationship with Marcus and the insight into Marcus's world and the battles he's fighting really lend weight to what could otherwise be a tasteless, rehashed Notting Hill.

Although the movie's end doesn't quite leave you punching the air and yelling ""Yes! Ten stars!"" it's still well worth the time, and it's complex and layered enough to be worth later re-watching (which is more than you can say for 99% of the movies out there, right?!).

All in all, a funky little gem of a movie that nicely marries Hollywood happy endings with credible characters, plot, and dialogue and a nifty, soulful, Britpoppy soundtrack. 4 1/2 thumbs up!",1213401600,,1771,4.8966666666666665

1444184,4,B00005JL7Q,"About A Boy revloves around a single man named Will (Hugh Grant) and his relationship with a troubled boy named Marcus. Will lives alone, happily avoiding responsibility by living off the royalities of his ""one hit wonder"" father's annoying Chiristmas song, and is content to spend his days watching TV. One day he decides to lie and say he has a two-year-old son to gain the attention of women at a single parent's group; the one he snags introduces him to her friend's 12 year old son Marcus. Marcus takes a liking to Will, and retreats to his apartment everyday to escape the reality of his mother's attempted suicide. Friendships form, troubles are overcome, love is sparked, you know how it works, but the cute and mostly tasteful comedy make this one worth it.

I've always been a big fan of Toni Collette, and here she plays Marcus' depressed and suicidal mother, giving yet again a wonderful performance. Hugh Grant is somewhat predictable, but hillarious nonetheless; he knows what he's doing by now and knows what his audience wants.

I felt that the movie was trying to evolve too many relationships at the same time, and because of that the most important one (between Will and Marcus) seemed lacking a bit. The plot isn't surprisingly original, but I don't think that's what the writers were going for. I'd still recommend this one, though, if for nothing else a nice laugh.

If you like this one you'd probably enjoy Dear Frankie.",1167782400,2,1444,4.768
1444185,5,B00005JL7Q,"ABOUT A BOY, based on Nick Hornby's 1998 hit novel, showcases a Hugh Grant veering away from his more normal role of hapless, stuttering romantic lead and, instead, this time, playing a shallow, emotionally stunted cad. Hugh Grant is so good in this role that it doesn't take long before you find yourself being charmed by this ingratiating, witty, and rudderless no-goodnik. Equally solid is the youngster Nicholas Hoult, who makes his film debut here. The not-quite-father-and-son (more like older-and-younger-brothers) rapport between Grant and Hoult, as well as a storyline which doesn't pander to the audience, makes this movie really work.

SPOILERS here: This movie is about a boy...and a man who acts like a boy. Will Lightman (Hugh Grant) is a 38 year old bachelor whose songwriting father once wrote a famous Christmas jingle, of which royalties Will is still cheerfully living on. Will has never worked in his life and uses his credo ""all men are islands"" to explain the lonely emptiness and aimlessness in his life. He spends all his time ensuring that his life is so compartmentalized that he has activities broken down into units of time (taking a bath: 1 unit, exercising: 3 units, having his hair carefully dis-shelved: 4 units, etc.). He's so irresponsible that when a friend invites him to become her baby girl's godfather, the aghast Will rejects the offer. His friend retorts in disbelief, ""I thought you had hidden depths,"" to which Will responds with a clarifying ""No, no, no, no...no. You always had that wrong. I really am this shallow."" The other lead character is Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), an odd 12-year-old boy who's a misfit in school and who's constantly worried about his unstable mother (Toni Collette). Marcus is so off-the-wall that even his nerdy chums cast him off as being too weird.

When Will turns his lasvicious eyes on single mothers, he discovers the SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together) support group. He joins a session and actually bags a picnic date with single mom Susie. However, on the day which will forever be known as the Dead Duck Day (oh, that poor duck!), Will is horrified to find out that the picnic will have added company in the form of  Marcus, whom Susie takes care of on occasion. The rest of the film depicts the relationship between Marcus and Will as, in due course, Marcus teaches Will to become more responsible and caring, and Will, in return, gives Marcus self-confidence and helps him to fit in better with his peers as Will becomes the go-to adult anchor in the boy's life. In the end, Will discovers that, instead of being a mere island, a chain of islands is infinitely more satisfying.

The story is great, obviously. Chris and Paul Weitz, who had earlier helmed AMERICAN PIE, would, at first, seem to be poor choices to be directing this higher brow effort, but, apparently, they were big fans of the book and managed to convince the right people. They do a massively good job here, conducting a delicate juggling act of comedy, pathos, and cynicism. The secret of this movie, of course, is that it contains a core of misery. The socially awkward Marcus is sadly unable to be a regular kid and is thus ridiculed by his peers. His mom is definitely ""off colored"" and is prone to fits of depression. And Will. The saddest thing may be that, for a great length of film time, he continues to endorse his solitary and meaningless way of life. When he does come around, finally, there's a feeling that he does it somewhat reluctantly. The bits of humor thrown into the mix perfectly balances out the picture and even works to bolster the pathos and make the cynicism seem less cruel.

The cast is excellent. And a very well done to Hugh Grant, who has matured to the point where I feel he's become a real thespian, instead of this clever bloke with a cute blinking gimmick and nice hair. And, of course, I continue to savor his urbane, uniquely British wit. His predominant on-screen partner, newcomer Nicholas Hoult, plays off him really well and they have nice moments that are quirky without being too syrupy. The best thing about Nicholas is that he didn't play his Marcus as confused but sweet. There were actually moments where I thought the kid was being too pushy or obtuse. I could see why other kids would bully him - Marcus is more than a bit off-kiltered. Still, you do end up rooting for him to do well. Toni Collette, as usual, convincingly makes her presence felt as Marcus's troubled mom as there were points in the film where I thought, ""Uh-oh, she really is gonna off herself."" More screen time for the ravishing Rachel Weisz would've been preferred, but I do understand that this film is about Will and Marcus and not Will and Rachel, so it's all good.

Special Features include: ""Spotlight on Location"": the 11-minute Making of ABOUT A BOY; feature commentary by Directors Chris and Paul Weitz; deleted scenes (with optional directors' commentary); music videos by Badly Drawn Boy (including the awesome ""Something to Talk About""; lyrics to ""Santa's Super Sleigh""; English to English dictionary; production notes; cast & crew bios; and the movie trailer.

As someone in the special features mentioned, this film is an intelligent blend of cynicism and hope. Nick Hornby's depiction of bachelorhood in England is well represented here as the directors strived mightily to be faithful in their adaptation, though, apparently, they did come up with new stuff for the end bits. So, yes, do try this one out. ABOUT A BOY is thoughtful, a bit prickly, funny, and not at all mawkish,and, because the film doesn't insult the audience's intelligence, it'll stay in your brain and in your heart just that much longer. Five stars from me.",1166572800,,5716,4.808748728382502
1444186,4,B00005JL7Q,"""About a Boy"" isn't your typical 'Hugh Grant Romantic Comedy,' and it's completely unexpected for a product from the directors of ""American Pie."" And it's better for it. As much as I love ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Notting Hill,"" this is the movie that rates a place in my DVD collection. Every time I watch it, it never fails to charm me, make me smile, and move me a little. How can you not love a movie that includes themes like suicide, depression and adolescent and modern-day allienation and weaves them into a comedy?

It's based on a Nick Hornby novel so, of course, it nails relationships from a male point of view. As screwed up as Hornby's protaganists are, I always feel better about men after I watch them. In this case, the ""boys"" in question are Will, a 38-year-old self-absorbed hipster, and Marcus, a dorky teenage kid with a troubled home and school life. The two of them form a friendship which makes both of them better, as you'd expect, but none of it comes off smaltzy or predictable. This is due to the performances by Grant and his young co-star, Nicholas Hoult, who hit all the right notes and make their strange friendship believable. Toni Collette is also grand as Marcus' struggle hippy single mother. There is a romance between Will and the Rachel character, but it doesn't dominate the movie and even that subplot stays grounded in reality.

The ending school concert often gets bagged on in reviews, and it is the part of the movie that feels the most contrived, but it still makes me smile. ""About a Boy"" is one of those lightly dramatic comedies where you do a lot of smiling.

The DVD has some nifty features as well. The commentary by the Weitz brothers is entertaining, and it contains some nice touches like the ""English to English"" dictionary and a couple featurettes on the music of Badly Drawn Boy. The music, incidentally, is tight. One of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. All in all, I like this movie. I like it a lot.",1166140800,,1974,4.570621468926554
1444187,3,B00005JL7Q,"'About a Boy' is starring Hugh Grant and this time he is a little different. He is not the clumsy guy he always is. In the beginning he is actually mean, but mean in a very funny way. He becomes friends with a boy (Marcus). At first he doesn't want that but Marcus changes him and slowly makes him a good man. Marcus himself has a mother who tries to kill herself (Toni Collette).

The film is very funny and has some moving points too. Nicholas Hoult who plays Marcus does a great job and I liked Hugh Grant in this film. He has all the funny things, in his words and his appearance. Toni Collette is strange but she proves again she is a hell of an actress. The actress I liked the most was Rachel Weisz (her character is also named Rachel) as the love interest of Hugh Grant, later on in the film. She is beautiful and very lovely, even with this little time on the screen.

The film has an intelligent story, adapted from the novel of Nick Hornby. All the characters have the exact right actor to play them. For the most part Hugh Grant makes this film work as a comedy and Nicholas Hoult and Toni Collette make it work as a drama. In the end you will feel good, and you had a good time as well.",1161993600,3,1199,4.119658119658119
1444188,4,B00005JL7Q,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  I thought it was going to be one of those schmaltzy variations of ""his heart grew three sizes that day, thanks to the magical, transformative power of a child's luuuuuuuv"".  Okay, the child, Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) has a lot to do with it, but the protagonist, Will Freeman (Hugh Grant) develops realistically and not radically.  Even at the end, Will is still not the kind of guy who will adopt five orphans and get a 9-5 job.  Still, he, a proudly self-proclaimed ""island"" among men, makes genuine connections with other, isolated people and is happier for it.

This is a movie stuffed full of ""ideas"", and they're handled well.  Modern isolation and the veneration of pointless consumerism and sloth.  Children--especially boys--who lack male role models.  Depression and its effect on the family, especially children.  What it means to fit in, what it means to stand out, and the price an individual pays either way.  The serious issues are given appropriate weight, but this is not a depressing movie.  There are plenty of laughs too: some sight gags, some verbal.

Toni Collette is fabulous as usual, and Natalia Tena does well with a small and unfortunately underused role.  Hugh Grant was terrific--this is his best work to date--and I look forward to seeing more of Nicholas Hoult.",1156291200,2,1333,4.923766816143497
1444189,5,B00005JL7Q,"I've never been much of a Hugh Grant fan, but he was surprising effective in this movie.  Grant's character starts out as a self centered womanizer who thought that having a kid around would make meeting women easier.  The kid hangs around Grant because in him the kid has a friend which would up his coolness quotient.  The comedy is subtle, but very effective.  This is not a laugh out loud kind of fare, but more of something you'd chukle to.  All in all, it's a very well made movie.  I especially like the ending.",1155686400,2,518,4.4
1444190,5,B00005JL7Q,"I like the plot of the story which you can see Will's changes gradually from a self-centred to a caring, loving guy.  I like the way Hugh Grant protrayed Will, speaking with brutal tone. His boyish behaviour makes me laugh all the time, telling lies, chasing ambulance and ridding his life of all responsibilty. Above all, his sarcastic remarks,""the most killing is that both of them close their eyes.""

Will is the real boy, instead of Marcus. On the contrary, Marcus seems to be more mature than Will. He knows how to care about his mum, though sometimes, he does in a wrong way.",1149379200,,581,4.576923076923077
1444191,4,B00005JL7Q,"I had resisted to see this film mostly because I'm not a huge fan of Hugh Grant, but after watching this film I have to say that I have a new found interest in his films...for he is quite a good actor.  Hugh plays Will, a single man who preys on women left and right to get laid.  He's crude and shallow and, well, he's really really shallow.  Things change for Will when he decides to join a single parents group all in serch of his next date (you'll see why single mothers are his prime choice).  Inadvertantly, through his meeting, he meets Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) who is in desperate need of some male attention.  He lives with his mother Fiona (Toni Collette) who is chronically depressed a bit suicidal.  Marcus, feeling that he's 'hit it off' with Will decides to make the first move and ask Will to spend time with him.  Throughout the process of the film we see that these two 'boys' need each other to become the 'men' they should be.  As Will realizes that he's finally caring about someone other than himself he has to fight to make sure he never loses it.  The film, while delving into the romantic comedy genra once Rachael Weisz steps onto the screen, is really more about finding ones place than finding ones mate.  Will may get the girl, but even more important, he got himself.",1146787200,,1295,4.4261603375527425
1444192,5,B00005JL7Q,"About a Boy starring Hugh Grant is such a sweet little gem. I saw this in the movie theatre with my best friend when it was released back in 2002, and I was surprised by how good Grant's acting was. It really shows his depth and vulnerability for such a serious and understood part. Grant plays a playboy who decides to seduce women who are single parents so he pretends he is a single parent too to date these ""desperate women."" Along the way he forms an unexpected friendship with a strange boy who is looking for a father figure. Toni Collete and Rachel Weisz also star. Grant's character begins to grow-up and realize what is important and that is having people you love close to you and opening yourself up to life's little disasters. A great romantic/friendship comedy, a funny and sensitive film, Highly recommend it.",1146614400,,824,4.612244897959184
1444213,5,B00005JL7Q,"I don't know why I love Hugh Grant movies so much; is it because of Hugh or the movie he chooses to act in?  I have to say that this is one of the best even though it is a departure from his usual fare of romantic comedies.  All the same, we have another stellar performance.  Will Freeman is a shallow, self-absorbed man who is independently wealthy.  This affords him a life that is completely boring (although he doesn't know it yet)--one that he fills with 30 minute segments--watching game shows, buying records, getting his hair cut, etc.  He has discovered a new way to date women though--single mothers are the best because there are no strings attached.  This is fine with Will as he is not emotionally attached to anyone.......until Marcus.

Marcus is the twelve year-old son of a chronically depressed suicidal hippie.  He is emotionally exhausted from trying to keep his mother happy (and alive) and finds a safe haven at Will's house.  For a while there is no talking, no sharing, just peace.  Eventually Will finds himself liking this misfit and tries to protect him from the school bullies.  Once our hero opens himself up to the possibility of caring for someone, other friendships and even love will follow.

Besides being laugh out loud funny, this adorable film has all the elements that make it a great movie.  A sweet, poignant story, people we really care about (and Hugh Grant is quite handsome!) plus a wonderful happily ever after ending make this a fairy tale that I will watch again and again.",1145145600,3,1520,4.690566037735849
1444214,5,B00005JL7Q,"I love this special little film!!  Hugh Grant does his usual schtick but this role is perfect for him--the clueless bachelor who is at the mercy of his feelings.  He hides from human emotion initially by creating the perfect bachelor schedule.  His facade is destroyed by the directness of a young boy who understands more about relationships.

The writing and acting are top-notch in this charming and satisfying movie. Relationships between the main characters are developed in a believable yet comedic way. The best thing about this movie is that it touches on deep issues without trivializing them and provides satisfying but realistic resolutions.",1143936000,3,652,5.240384615384615
1444215,5,B00005JL7Q,"In the wonderfully entertaining ""About A Boy,"" Hugh Grant shucks everything that made him famous nearly a decade earlier in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" (the floppy hair, the stuttering, etc.) and ends up giving his best performance to date. He plays Will, a wealthy, happily unemployed, commitment-phobic cad (slightly less insidious than Daniel Cleaver of ""Bridget Jones's Diary"") whose newest ploy is to date single mothers because they are easier to dump. However, he meets Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), the son of a somewhat suicidal mother (Toni Colette), and realizes that he cannot continue living his life so shallowly.

This film was based on Nick Hornby's wonderful book of the same name and retains much of the wit and touching humor. The early scenes depicting Will's ""full,"" but spiritually empty, life are particularly amusing, with Will dividing the day up into units of time and spending these units on ""web-based research"" (finding pics of supermodels with see-through tops), ""exercise"" (shooting pool), grooming, and the like. Grant makes his character irresponsible, but remains enormously likable throughout the film. This is important because we start to identify with him, and understand his fears of commitment and helplessness behind his outward superficiality. His mannerisms-Grant's specialty, I think-are v. entertaining to watch; the selfishness, hurt, anger, recognition and more pass across his face effortlessly. The other cast members- Nicholas Hoult, Toni Colette, and Rachel Weisz - are also v. good in their supporting roles and play off each other well.

The film doesn't follow the book too closely, however, but does one-up on the book by wisely emphasizing some parts that the book downplays. For example, Rachel (played by Rachel Weisz) only appears for a few pages in the book, but has much more presence in the movie. Through the Rachel character, we see how Will's relationship with her is different from his past shallow ones, and we realize that he is growing up. Also, the movie is filled with great one-liners and sharp, witty dialogue that never feels forced. The movie also employs voice-over function (Will's) very nicely; for example, in one serious scene, Will follows the ambulance to the hospital, looking rather serious, but in his voice-over he says. ""It was all terrible, just terrible. But driving fast behind the ambulance was fantastic."" The character would never say that out loud, but it provides comic relief and the assurance that he is, indeed, very shallow.

The strength of ""About a Boy"" is in the simplicity and power of its scenes. Not one scene is wasted; each one tells us a wealth about the characters and leads to Will's self-discovery. That, along with Hugh Grant's delightful performance, and backed by a great score from Badly Drawn Boy, make ""About A Boy"" one of the most delightful, entertaining, and touching movies I've seen. It's a great feel-good movie. Highly recommended, especially to Hugh Grant fans, or anyone who has ever empathized or sympathized with Will and his situation. One of my favorites. 10/10.",1138924800,5,3089,5.186372745490982
1444216,4,B00005JL7Q,"Wil (Hugh Grant) is the ultimate dilettante.  His father wrote a famous Christmas song and he has been living off the royalties all his life.  He thinks of everything in terms of 30 minute intervals.  Everyone in his life tells him he is wasting his life and it has no substance.

He is looking for relationships that fit into his lifestyle - no strings short term.  So he decides to date single moms.  The problem is how to meet them.  His first idea is to attend a single parents mixer.  This creates its own problem because he doesn't have a kid.  So he creates a 2 year old but he doesn't have any idea how a two year old acts or what a two year old can do.  This blows up in his face.

One day a boy shows up on his doorstep, Marcus (newcomer Nicholas Hoult) - (it's a little more complicated than that).  And he hires him to pretend to be his son.  He meets a beautiful single mom, Rachael (Rachael Wiess).  But things get complicated when Marcus has ideas of his own.  He wants Wil as his dad and tries to set him up with his offbeat mom (Toni Collette).

The real story is not Wil trying to find a temporary mate but that of Wil and Marcus.  Wil is the real child, a man who has never had to grow up, and Marcus the child adult, a boy forced to grow up too fast.  These are the wonderfully touching and truly inspirational scenes.

Of course, the Wil and Rachael story has to blow up and does.  The movie has a touching and almost over the top ending but it works.

This is the typical Hugh Grant character but he has found a way to make it interesting and new.  Toni Collette continues to amaze me.  She can do anything.  And Nicholas Hoult is perfect, let's see if he can keep it up.

""About a Boy"" exploits Hugh Grant's edge and much of his considerable charm in its story of a 38-year-old London bachelor who accidentally becomes entangled in the life of a 12-year-old boy. In addition to being a smart comedy, it's an honest movie about childhood that avoids sappiness and sentiment and goes in unexpected directions.

Throughout the hilarity of the script, the movie is really about the two boys -- the big one and the little one and about how each has something the other one needs.  I appreciated and enjoyed the humanity of the story, as sentiment is earned and not forced, and is always balanced with caustic humor.",1129420800,2,856,4.889655172413793
1444219,5,B00005JL7Q,"I love this movie.  I first saw it on a cable station and just got pulled into it.  Might be because of Hugh Grant...*SIGH*  anyways!  It is very comical in several aspects of the story line and sad as well.

I don't want to spoil but just a bit of an overview, a guy that has nothing to do b/c he's so rich invents a kid to meet women, and then meets a kid that has a mom that's a loon.  The kid thinks, ""RIGHT ON!  He can help me with my mum!""  The truth comes out about the made up kid and then Hugh Grant's character makes up to be the father of the kid with the looney mum to impress another woman.  That doesn't work out very well but in the end everybody is really happy!  WAHOO!!

There are lots of spots that are funny because it's where the truth has to be told and they just don't know how to tell it without repercusions.  Love those parts!",1126828800,,852,3.947058823529412

Grant was hilarious as the grumpy single guy who lives alone.  His delivery was perfect.  I couldn't imagine anyone else after seen him in the role.

Fans of the book should know that the movie deviates a great deal from the base material, but it is entertaining and well scripted none the less.

The actor that plays Marcus was excellent as well and I hope he is still in the acting profession.

Excellent movie.",1125446400,,589,4.398148148148148

Hugh Grant, who I normally cannot stand, was great as the carefree and careless playboy.  I almost broke down and cried when Will (played by Grant) accompanied Marcus' nervously rendered version of ""Killing Me Softly"" on guitar before a hostile audience of teenagers.

This film is an instant classic - it has a little of everything - romance, comedy, drama.  Very touching story about a series of lonely people meeting and accepting each other.  It's also about transformation.  By the end of the movie, Will has changed from a cad to a caring and compassionate adult.

Hugh Grant has a knack for playing self centered pricks or bumbling fools. In this he is doing the self centered thing. This movie is hilarious and heartfelt. Nick Hornsby seems to translate well to the big screen, High Fidelity was just as good as this. This film shines as a story of love, transformation, and redemption, as well as a offering a lot of laughs along the way.",1123027200,2,489,4.384615384615385
1444263,3,B00005JL7Q,That's a nice movie but there is nothing which is creative. It is an enjoyable movie but I have seen better films of Hugh Grant.,1122508800,,128,4.16
1444264,3,B00005JL7Q,"Hugh Grant seems to have perfected the role of playing the spoiled young Rich person.  In many of his films, this is the role he has been cast into - and he has done a brilliant job at perfecting his character in each of these roles.  I've become a big fan of Hugh Grant's - not because of the characters he plays, but because he probably has become the top actor in his profession when it comes to Romantic Comedy films.  I was particularly excited about the film ""About a Boy"".  In addition to having the spoiled rich man in a Romantic Comedy, Grant was going to be able to demonstrate his talents opposite a young boy.  While this film did entertain me, I probably wouldn't put this film at the top of Grant's portfolio of film work he has done.

This film is basically divided into two parts.  In the first part of film, we see Grant as Will - a rich single bachelor who doesn't need to work and who enjoys the singles scene.  Will is content with his life.  Will gets the idea of pursuing ""single moms"", however Will intends fully to continue to ""play the field"" without getting bogged down into any commitment.  He even invents an imaginary son to help in his pursuit of single moms.  While dating a single mom, Will meets nerdy 12-year-old Marcus Brewer.  Marcus is the son of a friend of this particular single mom.  It seems that Marcus' mother Fiona is suffering from serious depression problems - and even tries to commit suicide.  Fiona's suicide attempt is unsuccessful, and following that - Marcus decides that Will would be the perfect companion for his mother.  Although Marcus' attempts at setting Will and his mother fail, Marcus soon develops a liking for Will as friend.  Thus, the first part of the film, we see a bond between to form between Will and Marcus.

In the second part of the film, things begin to change.  Will begins to pursue a woman named Rachel (played by Rachel Weitz), who also has a young son.  For the first time, Will begins to see things differently.  He begins to realize how shallow his life has been to this point, and that he may want to do more than just play the field.  Now it's Will who must enlist Marcus' help to win over Rachel.  Meanwhile Marcus is still having problems - coping with his mother's depression and trying to win over a girl he likes.  When things go sour with Will and Rachel, it's Marcus who calls on Will for help.  But Will is having self-doubts, and is not sure he can be there for Marcus.

There are some good and bad things about this film.  For starters, Hugh Grant delivers another stellar performance.  While in movies such as ""Nine Months"", we've seen Grant able to pull of the physical comedy, this movie focuses more on Grant's dry sense of humor - and this comes off brilliantly.  One terrific scene is at the end of the movie when Grant comes on stage with Marcus and sings a duet of ""Killing Me Softly"".  It's a scene that you wouldn't expect from Hugh Grant, yet it comes off brilliantly.  One thing that is interesting is that the film is narrated from two perspectives.  The first perspective comes from Will.  Will narrates the story from his point of view and as he narrates it we see a transformation of the self-centered rich person who plays the field to the person wanting more out of life and being a responsible person others can rely on.  The second perspective comes from Marcus.  Marcus will narrate things and we see how he transforms from a nerdy kid lacking self-confidence, to a person who has gained self-confidence thanks to his friendship with Will.  Finally, I liked the fact that the movie was filmed in England.  I've always felt that Grant has been very strong when he is on his ""home turf"" - in such movies as ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" and ""Notting Hill"", he has blended into the London scene perfectly.

As for the bad things.  I did not care for Nicholas Hoult's portrayal of Marcus.  I did not find Marcus the boy who would ""warm our hearts"" and be a scene-stealer.  In fact, I think it was almost delibrate that he wasn't a scene-stealer.  I found Hoult's portrayal as Marcus as one that would make the Marcus character unlikable - even though you feel sorry for him that he is dealing with a mother who suffers from depression.  There is a scene in the movie that leaves you hanging - it is when Will is in a liquor store and he has a memory of his father in the liquor store.  I know a point was trying to be made here about Will's background and character - but to me this scene should have either been removed or expanded on.  Instead, I found myself asking more questions.

Finally, I did not like how the movie came to a conclusion.  I thought the setting of the school Rock concert was pretty weak - even though this was the setting for the scene where Will sings ""Killing Me Softly"".  But to me - there had to be a better, more emotional setting for a conclusion to this movie.  We've seen great conclusions in such films as ""Notting Hill"" and ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", but this film seems to drop the ball.  I did like the ""epilogue"" to the movie - when we see how everything turns out.

Overall, I still did enjoy the movie.  If you are a Hugh Grant, this will keep you happy.  However, you probably will realize that this isn't like some of the other ""Home Run"" films (""Nine Months"", ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", ""Love, Actually"")  that Hugh Grant has been a part of.  It's still a movie worth checking out.",1119139200,3,5423,4.4407294832826745
1444265,5,B00005JL7Q,"I've watched this movie more than any other in my DVD library. The unlikely story of how an independently wealthy and shallow guy in his late 30s living a pointless existence (Hugh Grant) hooks up with a dorky (but not at all sickening) twelve year old boy and the way their offbeat relationship flourishes is endlessly charming.

There's nothing preachy, saccharine, or depressing in the movie, despite the fact that the kid's mother (played by the gifted actress Toni Colette) tries to commit suicide at one point and the kid performs Roberta Flack's ""Killing Me Softly"" to a hostile audience of rowdy teens.. I hate to use the word ""heartwarming"", but darned if it isn't. It's one of those movies you will want to see again.",1118966400,6,727,4.76984126984127

The characters ring true and are so diverse that anyone should be able to identify with one or more of them.  With all their faults and problems, they are still likable and very human.  Who would think that a movie dealing with loneliness, depression, suicide, alcoholism, abandonment and anger could be so positive, happy and inspiring, while still ringing true? The message of caring and love is powerful and moving, no matter how many times I have seen it.

This movie is also cleverly funny.  Hugh Grant (and everyone else) is wonderful.  The music is perfect.

No seriously, this movie -""About a Boy""- is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and not to mention imagined to see Hugh Grant act in. This is my favorite Grant-movie, and it was after this I really began to respect the actor behind the famous icon -no one could have done this better than him in this movie -in fact; ""About a Boy"" IS Hugh Grant, in good company of young boy he acts against. Their chemistry, and their characters' contrasts are what makes this movie so interesting, and ""realistic"" actually. It's not a comedy, yet it's funny -it's not an ordinary drama, yet it's gripping!

1444269,5,B00005JL7Q,"What a refreshing role for Hugh Grant!  We've all seen him as the bumbling charmer, but those roles in the past seem to melt together.  ABOUT A BOY is different in that Hugh Grant's character shows more emotions, flaws, fears, and frailties.

Hugh plays Will, a single 30-something guy who has never had to work a day in his life because of royalities he gets from a song his dad wrote.  While not working sounds like a great idea, it has turned him into an immature man-child that enjoys isolation and breaking his day up into ""units of time"" for different mundane activities, like surfing the web, playing pool, and watching game shows.

Realizing that no self-respecting women will ever want anything to do with him, Will joins SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together) to hit on those beautiful single moms that are so desperate that they'll even go out with him.  The fact that he has to conjour up an imaginary child is a small detail.

Along the way he meets Marcus, a thoughtful boy of a single mom played by Toni Collette.  Marcus is mature and observant and very isolated at school, but not by choice.  As their odd friendship grows, Will and Marcus begin to fill the holes in each other's lives and in their personalities.

This is an original story with great characters and a unique plot.  It will leave you with a smile and thinking about these characters you grow to care about for a while afterwards.

This film simplifies the storyline and the characters to the point where the heart and bones of the whole thing is ripped to shreds.

You might be mildly entertained if you haven't already read the book, but really, if you haven't read the book yet this might very well put you right off it, and that would be a shame, because Nick Hornby is a great writer.

I'll put this review in context by adding that I felt completely the opposite about High Fidelity, another film made from a Nick Hornby novel, which was truly marvellous and inspiring.",1109462400,,631,4.517543859649122
1444271,2,B00005JL7Q,"I wanted to like this movie, I really did.  But I was disappointed by it.

The premise of the film is that Will (Hugh Grant), a selfish slacker who has no job and lives off his father's old royalty fees, decides to start preying on single mothers who are looking for a little romance.  He then meets Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), the young son of a suicidal woman who is desperately seeking help and friendship.  Will eventually asks Marcus to pretend to be his son in order to have a shot at dating an attractive single mom (Rachel Weisz), and everything goes downhill from there.

""About a Boy"" isn't at all what I expected it to be.  I didn't think it was all that funny or moving, and I probably wouldn't have sat through the entire thing if it weren't for the fact that I adore Hugh Grant, and he really does a great job in the film.  I think my biggest problem with the movie is that the kid who plays Marcus is kind of freaky, and I cringed every time his creepy little face popped up on the screen.  I do not recommend seeing this film unless you are a big fan of Hugh Grant, in which case I suggest tuning in only for the final fifteen minutes so you can see him sing a rousing rendition of ""Killing Me Softly,"" which is pretty freakin' hilarious.  Otherwise, this is definitely a film to pass up.",1106611200,4,1301,4.2560975609756095
1444290,4,B00005JL7Q,"...if this movie had fallen into the hands of a lesser director, particularly a cloying and schmaltzy American one (read: Steven Spielberg, Joel Schumacher, etc.) this movie could've easily turned into your standard full-blown Hollywood blockbuster of a catastrophe.

Amazingly enough, it fell into the hands of the directors of ""American Pie,"" who were wise enough to keep the film's location in London rather than transplanting it to say New York or LA as was done to Nick Hornsby's other book, ""High Fidelity,"" which was also London-based and barely survived its transplantation to Chicago.  Most importantly, they were also wise enough to preserve most of the original book's characteristically British flavor.

You know the kind of vintage Hollywood cheesefest I'm talking about: one of those kitschy, brain-dead, focus-group-spawned, tear-jerking, cheesy-feel-good plotlines affirming ""family values"" and other assorted crockery with the painfully melodramatic UPLIFTING HAPPY ENDING you could see coming about ten miles away.

Well, this movie comes close to the edge of that abyss but thankfully gets pulled back every time by a very potent antidote: British humor!  Otherwise known as sarcasm, irony, wit, and other terms seldom understood in this Bushian age of ""reality"" shows and semi-retarded presidents.  This film is full of that, with a very strong snappy script that could only have been written on that little island off the western coast of Europe...and no, I don't mean Ireland.

There are sprinklings of cheese here and there but plenty of merciful restraint, so all the parts that had me cringing in anticipation of a full-frontal CHEESE ASSAULT actually turned out to fairly well, it was done in the most admirably tasteful moderation.

The special features on this DVD are also noteworthy.  I've never seen a film with so many deleted scenes that made me wish they had NOT been deleted!  (With most films it's easy to see why the ""Deleted Scenes"" were deleted.)  There's also some music videos and artist info about the British pop band whose music dominates the pleasantly catchy pop soundtrack, and an ""English to English"" dictionary feature which I'm sure Americans who've never been exposed to British English idioms will find extremely useful.

He walks into Grant's life and turns everything upside down and they both learn to be men. Instead of going for broad comedy the script is more subtle, focusing on people's dilemmas, contradictions, hypocrisies and even finding humour in their tragic failures. It's really a drama that takes everything very seriously.

In this film he portrays a thirtyish slacker who lives off an inheritance who is confronted with the reality of growing up.  This guise comes in the form of a maladjusted adolescent(Nicholas Houlte) who has to deal with bullies and his mother's suicidal tendencies.  Grant's character serves as a mentor for the lad and in the process matures himself.  The title of the film has something of a double-meaning.  Does it refer to the young boy or Grant's character?  The acting in this film is excellent with Houlte giving a natural performance and Toni Collette as his mother gives a complex reading of a character that could have been cliched.  The script here is excellent.  There are a number of scenes that stand-out.  One involves Grant volunteering for Amnesty International so he can meet girls on the phone bank.

Hugh Grant's character, Chase, is a low life heir who has nothing better to do with his time than shop and watch television. In the beginning of the film, Chase goes on a number of dates, which all end in a comical matter. However, all of his relationships are meaningless until he meets a single mother and her son. Being the self-centered man that he is, he is drawn to her motherly qualities.  When this woman breaks up with him, he decides to go to a meeting for single parents, while pretending he is a single father. While there, he meets a woman who has a single daughter and makes a date with her. When he arrives at her house there is another young boy there whom she is babysitting.

Meanwhile, Chase and the other woman break up, Chase tries to let the boy go, but the boy is persistent in arriving at his house everyday after school. As their relationship develops, Chase helps the boy get through all his teenage problems, from girls, to his suicidal mother.  The outcome of their relationship leads to a hilarious ending, which would make anyone laugh, whether having seen the movie before or not.

1444295,5,B00005JL7Q,"Will is not exactly what most women would consider the Catch of the Week.  Sure, he's charming, devilishly handsome and terribly winsome when he wants to be, but. . .well, he's never at any time in his life held a job, content to live off the royalty's of his dad's one hit song; he cares only for himself and is perfectly pleased, even proud, to be shallow and without any hidden depths; and even if all this is not a deterent, the relationship will last no longer than two months at the most, and it will revolve mostly around sex.

Marcus is. . .well. . .the opposite.  He's a very sweet child, but not smooth or cool to say the least, and sweetness doesn't really matter terribly in the junior high.  Also, Marcus cares almost too much.  His life is his Mom and his Mom is unraveling.  Marcus finds himself stuck.  He has to be the man of the house, and he has to hold his fragile family together because his mother is just not up to the task.  Lately, she's been crying a lot. . .even in the mornings, and she's never cried in the mornings before.  This occupies Marcus' thoughts more than school or reputation or anything else.  It influences his behavior, making him an even easier target for the cruel schoolyard crowd.

Will and Marcus find their lives suddenly intersecting.  This is the basis for the newest adaptation of a Nick Hornby (""High Fidelity"") novel, entitled ""About a Boy.""  And it is excellent.  Will, played perfectly by Hugh Grant, is perhaps even more hopeless than Rob Gordon, John Cusack's character from ""High Fidelity.""  Marcus is played by newcomer Nicholas Hoult, who is a true find.  Casting is a major factor in films with large child roles, but Nicholas is absolutely perfect as Marcus.  The rest of the cast is well-chosen as well, but the film really comes down to Will and Marcus and the smart screenplay--and these three elements make it a five-star film.

Will, always the commitment-phobic playboy, discovers the world of single mothers, which he sees as the Holy Grail of Bachelorhood.  What could be the downside?  These women are emotionally scarred, hungry for physical affection and too reluctant to pursue any relationship for too long because of their children.  Brilliant!  To meet these beauties, Will shows up at a meeting of SPAT--Single Parents, Alone Together.  To join up, he invents a 2-year-old in his own life who, naturally, is always with his mother whenever the opportunity to meet him shows up.  Through the group, Will finds himself paired with Marcus, who needs somebody to lean on as his mother is spiraling out of control.  Before long, Will's life starts to find something it's never really had before:  Meaning.  And Marcus finds his world expanding and himself growing up as he finds someone who cares about him other than just his mum.

Bottom line:  ""About a Boy"" is very funny, poignant and meaningful.  Also, the direction and cinematography do nothing but enhance the plotline. . .they are right-on as well, and do not detract as so often is the case today.  The characters are worth caring about and the plot is enveloping.  The soundtrack is very well done by Badly Drawn Boy.  ""About a Boy"" is one of those films that hits high marks on all levels, and it can actually maybe even benefit the viewer to see it.  I have nothing bad I can say about the film.  Perhaps I can't even articulate the good--the excellent--points of this movie here.  Just watch it.  It's very much worth your time.",1098316800,4,3466,4.669421487603306

1444331,5,B00005JL7Q,"I first saw this movie while on a business trip to Chattanooga. I needed to finish up some work on a presentation I was making the next day and there was nothing on TV, so I decided to splurge and rent an On-Demand movie. Most of the movies I had either seen, or had no interest in seeing and just as I was about to turn it off, I came across About A Boy. I hadn't heard much buzz about the movie and I'm not a fan of Hugh Grant, but for reasons unknown to me, I rented it.
I was expecting another one of Hugh Grant's saccharine romantic comedies where he plays a charming befuddling fop as he's done ad nauseam since Four Weddings And A Funereal. Granted, I liked Four Weddings immensely, but by Notting Hill I'd had my fill. Much to my surprise, Grant was playing a completely different character and was clearly attempting to break his mold. He'd done that once before in Bridget Jones' Diary, where he played a jerk, but now he was taking it in another direction entirely. It's a refreshing and more importantly interesting change.
But this movie isn't all about Hugh Grant's character Will. His co-star is new comer Nicholas Hoult, who plays the boy Marcus and he carries his own. Ultimately, the movie is about both of them, and so Hoult has the responsibility of carrying half the weight of the movie and he does a splendid job. Rounding out the cast is Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz, each do an excellent job as well. Suffice to say that the casting for this movie is brilliant. Each character is fully developed and rich with complexity and emotion. I bought each and every one of them. Not once did I feel that there was a weak link in the bunch. That's also surprising because this type of movie is hard to pull off.
So what kind of movie is this? At it's heart, this movie is a comedy. That being said, with subject matter such as suicide, it is most definitely a drama as well. That's a fine line to walk in a film but Weitz Brothers deftly manage to pull it off. Granted their movie is based on the Hornby book by the same name, so they had a rich palette to begin with, but the brothers clearly rose to the challenge and created a fantastic movie. There have been plenty of good books that have been butchered at the box office and Boy is a rare exception. There's no cliche' choices made by the characters and the director's did a great job at staying true to the tone of the book. Chris and Paul also stretched themselves with their camera work and it pays off. If you're into ""film"" there's a lot to chew on between the use of jump cuts, depth of focus and swing shots. None of this gets in the way of the movie. If anything these camera techniques add to the performances and help tell the story.
Interweaving it's way throughout the movie and in some cases almost playing a role in the film, is the music and it is spot on. All the music was written by Badly Drawn Boy specifically for this movie. I was not familiar with the artist prior to seeing the film, but the director's couldn't have made a better choice. Although each song stands on it's own on the soundtrack, each song also easily blends into the scene and lends a hand in creating just the right tone for the movie. After listening to the soundtrack, I could imagine it as simply a regular artist release, so it stands on it's own. Yet when it's worked into the movie it's pure gold.
So why do I like it so much? I'd like to think that I'm not alone in this, but it's because I can relate to the movie on so many levels. There are so many scenes that I could describe, but in the end I would be retelling the entire movie. Every scene has something in it that is worth watching again and again. I can relate to Marcus as he's picked on in school, tries to cope with his mother's depression and ultimately knowingly faces complete and utter embarrassment as a last ditch effort to make his mother happy. The names and places have been changed to protect the innocent, but I've been there. Then there's Will who has to finally face his demons and his father's legacy in order to join the human race and be a part of other peoples lives. Although not an exact context, I've been there in one way shape or form.
Surprisingly, I caught myself watching it again the other day on DVD and it struck me that this movie is now in my Top 10, or dare I say Top 5 movie list. I maybe be borrowing from another fantastic Hornby book/movie High Fidelity, but it's true. It's not Citizen Kane, but it is one of the best movies that takes a funny look at becoming a man through two different people. In trying to describe this movies to others, I've called it ""A guy's romantic comedy."" That doesn't really nail it on the head, but I'd like to think that About A Boy, IS a guy's movie. The subject matter may not have Rambo's, or Rocky's, but any guy who can think about something other than sports, or monster trucks should get something from this movie. It's Hugh Grant's best work to date. It's based on a hugely successful book and it's funny as hell. What's not to like?",1086825600,5,5042,4.302839116719243

I like it very much the way Hugh Grant (Will) and the boy Nicholas Hoult (Marcus) tell the story as it goes for both of them. It seems that complicity of both characters is totally represented by both actors. I have seen Hugh Grant in a huge number of romantic comedies and I didn't expect much of him but THIS IS DIFFERENT. As he says in the extra material he represents 100% a British, rich, handsome, useless bachelor. He is even more irresistible for children than for women.
Some acting parts are beautifully absurd: when Will plays guitar helping Marcus to sing ""Killing Me Softly"", when he goes to the SPAT to meet all divorced women into therapy, when Marcus tries to conquer the older girl by singing his brand-new rap CD...

1444336,4,B00005JL7Q,"Why people keep banging on about Hugh Grant's performance in 'About A Boy' is beyond me. Now, it's not that he's not excellent, because he is, but there are so many other excellent, multi-faceted performances in here, and they really are deserving of as much attention as Grant.
The plot follows that of Grant as Will, a single man whose ineptitude at relationships has left him very alone at the age of 38. Upon realising that single mothers are an untapped source of women and one-night stands, he invents himself a child and joins the group SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together). Here he meets Susie, who introduces him to Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) and his hippie, depressive mother Fiona (Toni Collette). From here, Will and Marcus form an unlikely attachment as the man teaches the boy about trendy living, and the boy teaches the man about human relationships.
Although the screenplay does interfere quite a bit with the story laid down in Nick Hornby's excellent original novel (of the same name, and well worth a read), this becomes immaterial in the face of powerhouse performances from the three leads. Grant as Will is very convincing as the emotionally-frozen man who starts to thaw slowly. He's wry and detached, and his trademark Brit-Flop method of acting is wisely reigned in here. He's very, very good as Will. Nicholas Hoult as Marcus is truly excellent, a highly gifted child actor playing a part which is essentially adult in attitude and depth, and he does a supreme job with the character of the slightly indie, left-field Marcus. And Toni Collette is simply stunning as the hapless Fiona, a hippie-mom whose passion for individuality leads to her son's ostracisation and her own depression. She is tender, believable and heartwarming, and generates huge amounts of sympathy for her character.
Direction is really very, very good, with some interesting arial shots and gorgeous camerawork used by the brothers Weitz to illustrate various states of emotional turmoil experienced by the three protagonists. This creativity and professionalism, as well as the general all-round feeling of warm detatchment created by the film, is a far greater testament to the Weitz Boys' talent than any of the abysmal 'American Pie' trilogy.
All in all, this is a really wonderful movie. Warming, thought-provoking and refreshingly different, it's a triumph of acting and a hugely welcome change from the Hollywood Brigade.
Highly recommended.",1078963200,2,2445,5.115

The irony of a young lad who has a feeling for the important things influencing a change in a grown up with no feeling for anything but himself.  Through out the movie, Grant's character Will is getting closer and closer to being an honest person with some meaning in his life.  It takes a young boy with a need, Marcus, to shake that lose in him.
You can read the othe reviews about what he was up to originally, yet the touching part about the movie is how much Will grows to care, to care in general for someone and something without looking for anything in return.  Isn't that really where life has meaning anyway.
The movie is an attempt to teach that by caring we can help others in ways that even we do not understand.  This movie is brilliantly cast and produced.  You wonder if you are going to shut it off at first, yet the humor in the movie keeps you going until you just enjoy the plot and the story and you get to hoping that something gets better for someone.

Great material (it is based on Nick Hornby book), good work of directors and acting compensate and make the difference. I thought I wouldn't be able to stand one more Hugh Grant appearance that is so familiar from many other his movies. But somehow this movie makes me forget about other similar acting gigs by Grant. The movie leaves yoou with a very nice a warm feelings and what else can you ask from romantic comedy - hard to believe that the same directors (Paul & Chris Weitz) did 'American Pie'.",1077062400,,616,4.460176991150442
1444359,3,B00005JL7Q,"After the sucessful ""High Fidelity"", another Nick Hornby novel was adapted to the big screen. This time the Weitz Bros (of ""American Pie"" fame) are the chosen directors, and they manage to deliver an entertaining, honest and meaningful comedy that`s above many laugh-a-minute flicks out there.
Like most Nick Hornby`s oeuvres, ""About a Boy"" presents a funny, intelligent story that deals with the subject of isolation, loneliness, personal growth and contact with those who surround us, approaching this themes in a simple, natural and engaging way.

Will (played by a convincing Hugh Grant) is the typical late twenties slacker who lives in his own world and doesn`t bother much with what goes on beyond his reduced circle, living a shallow, selfish and uninteresting everyday routine. Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) is a smart though lonely kid that has no friends or motivations, and whose only companion is his single, neurotic and depressed mother (Toni Collette). As the movie develops, Will and Marcus become friends and forge a personal bond, providing some hilarious, clever moments and a couple of touching ones, too.
This, like ""High Fidelity"", is a guy flick, since men are the ones who can find some situations here more relatable, though it still is a worthwile movie for everyone anyway. Personally, I could identify with both Marcus and Will, discovering parallels between my life and theirs.

Despite its somewhat predictable plot, ""About a Boy"" is nonetheless a witty, poignant picture, with an intriguing storytelling and a couple of well-observed details about mundane life (Will`s cynical description of time passing through). And it even has an interesting and appealing soundtrack by offbeat indie star Badly Drawn Boy.
Worth a look.",1076630400,2,1749,5.265232974910394
1444360,5,B00005JL7Q,"This was a very neat movie dealing with isolation, misery and the need for connection.  It's about 3 people who are in a bind, stuck in isolation, not really knowing how to deal with it or how to change it---plus they are surrounded by folks that either don't see them, or are well meaning, but cannot connect with them to help them.  The three people are Will (Grant), Marcus the boy, and his mother, Fiona (Collette).
  Will technically should be in Nirvana, he is wealthy, doesn't work, is attractive enough to nail a different gal every night, yet really isn't doing much with his life--no passions like travel, golf, friends, etc.  His idea of Christmas is watching videos and getting drunk at home, alone.  His domineering Stephord-Wife sister & dope husband constantly has humiliating ""interventions"" with him, even in public, trying to fix his ""loser-ness"".  They want him to live just like they do, with the house, baby and spoiled uncontrolleable-animal toddler that hits folks in the sack, goo on the upholstery--not appealing.
  For all that he feels ""OK"", he keeps searching for the next woman---as opposed to hiring an escort service which would be more logical for what he claims to ""want"" in a woman.  He's even started an elaborate scheme to meet single mothers, thinking  low-risk target.  (Still not an escort service, so I think he does hope ultimately for connection.)  He is very aware that his lifestyle is a turnoff to most women who have interests & passions.  He never keeps anybody around long enough to get close and risk more pain.  Basically, he's not really living what could be a really cool life.
  Fiona is a new-age hippy vegetarian music-therapist, and is raising her boy, Marcus, that way.  For all her career and success at living the completely hippy, vegetarian lifestyle, you would think she would be in bliss too, but she too is desperately sad and alone, without many friends.  She is very controlling over her boy, and he has no way to rebel against her controlling, politically-correct dominations.
  Marcus, who has only his mother's viewpoints, none of his own in the beginning, is a very nerdy, granola boy.  His mother screeches ""I love you's"" at his school playground, making him giant Bulleye.  He's completely dressed the opposite of all the other kids, plus he retreats from reality quite often, going into fantasyland and singing at the worst times.  He's watching his mother slide down the depression slope, and after her attempt at suicide, he decides to bring in extra help--unsuspecting Will.
  Will accidentally met Marcus while trying to score on one single mother.  Marcus sized him up and decided he was a good material for helping his mother.  Unfortunately, Will wasn't interested.  But, Marcus craves friendship, since he had none, and his mother is a basketcase.  So, the adventure begins with Marcus pursuing the unwilling Will.  You can see though, that Will is growing to really depend on the human contact.
  I do think they are about the same age, although not sure what age that is.  The boy has been parenting his mother, watching her depression progress, trying to fix it.  Will runs away from any human emotions...  (Although Will finds babies and toddlers unappealing, I don't at all think this point makes him immature.  That idea comes from ""obsessed-with-children""-types that bully you to worship their demon-children, or get labeled awful things.)
  Anyway, you see the change these folks bring about in each other.  Maybe they each provide a safe place to bring about change.  Marcus finally has a place and a friend to talk about his things without anybody trying to control his thoughts.  Mom finally gets some realistic feedback on her parenting and mental health, plus somebody caring about her that knows the truth.  Will finally has a safe, land-mine free place to experiment with feelings, a buddy to pal around with, and grows some bravery.

1444363,5,B00005JL7Q,"When my friend suggested we go see this movie, I thought I was getting dragged to some chick flick.  I was reluctant, but she wasn't in town long and so I went.
When I came out from watching to movie, I was stunned silent.  So was she.  And generally we both love analyzing books & movies to death.  All either of us could say was, ""That was one of the best movies I've ever seen.""  And we understood each other's silence and rested in the comfort that the other had been just as stunned.
Does that sound too dramatic?  I'm sorry if it does.  I was, after all, expecting complete romantic rubbish.  And I don't hate Hugh Grant by any stretch of the imagination, but his characters aren't really inspiring.  If you feel that way, though, you should watch this movie.  You really catch a different side of him.  He plays an intelligent, witty, self-absorbed bachelor...which, apparently, is much closer to who Hugh Grant is as a person.  No insult is intended...but, from what I read, Grant appears to a loner, an introvert, a perfectionist, and - well - a bachelor ever since some unfortunate events in his life.
OK, that all said, I should move onto the movie's plot.  Basically, you have this incredibly selfish bachelor (Grant) whose character is immediately engaging because he is incredibly aware of & honest about being selfish.  I found his character to be a complete breath of fresh air after being surrounded by so many people pretending to be something else.  He was honest...and he was even sincere if you could look his armor of self-indulgent behaviors.
Then you have this boy Marcus.  (Yes, it's about a real 12 year old boy.  It's not a romance about some guy.)  And this boy is incredibly intelligent for his age.  Incredibly!  But he's also completely lost in his own world - which you can understand when you meet his mother...and, later, his father.  His clothes are enough to get him beat up without his singing in class & getting walked to school by his mom.
But, don't worry, it's not as predictable as Grant getting together with Marcus's mom.  That would make it a romance.  Instead, you have a very quirky set of events to bring this man and this boy together.  Some of the events are some of the funniest scenes I'd seen in a long time.  However, some of the other scenes are an unglamorized look at the struggles most people are going through.
And, I must mention that I absolutely LOVE the wake-up call given to the hippy, earth-loving culture.  I somewhat border on this culture b/c I love trees & earth & loose clothing & all things natural.  However, sometimes it goes too far and this movie calls it like it is...which I never thought would happen in a liberal industry like film.  I thought a film would be trashed immediately if it questioned such lifestyles.  But this script is so intelligent & realistic that you can't help but agree.
Ultimately, I think it's this interlacing of witty genius, sincere characters, bold commentary and realistic emotion that makes this movie a masterpiece.  You never can relax and dismiss it as a comedy.  But you can never settle & dismiss it as a drama.  It's this incredibly poignant mix of antics, relationships - functional & disfunctional, sincere characters with flaw, and vivid realism that draws me in to this movie every time I watch it.

1444366,5,B00005JL7Q,"I rented this because I wanted something to make me smile, Pirates of the Caribbean was out, and a rerun of Sense and Sensibility made me remember how much I always enjoy Hugh Grant.  In short:  my expectations were low.  I'd read the book when it came out and very much enjoyed it, but expected a movie to take the premise and make it formulaic.
That premise:  a likeable wastrel, a cad with no malice in him, a slacker with money, pretends to have a child so he can meet single mothers-- they are nurturing, sexy, and tend not to want long relationships.  A variety of circumstances forces him into a big-brother-type relationship with a nerdy 12-year old with a suicidal hippy mother.
Now, the best thing about Nicholas' Hornby's boos isn't the situation-- it's the insight of the characters, the little thoughts they share that we all have.  Well, like the earlier film of a Hornby book, High Fidelity, this movie captures many of them by using voiceovers-- and it works perfectly!  How can you not like a character who while sincerely upset by having to go to the hospital following the hippy mother's suicide attempt, confides that driving fast behind the ambulance was brilliant?
Is there a driver among us who wouldn't secretly think the same thing?  Sure, we wouldn't share it-- but that's what makes Will's character so likeable.  He's basically an honest person-- he only lies to get girls.  He is shallow, knows it, and is content.
Or so he thinks.
I also love that it's obvious that Will and the hippy mother will NOT miraculously hook up, that the nerdy boy transforms gradually-- no Pretty Woman-like miraculous makeover.  The pair of cool trainers (sneakers) Will buys for him is stolen by bullies!
And yet, we do see the characters change.
I found I just didn't want the movie to end.  It was charming, and smart.  Hugh Grant plays these smart, charming, mischievous characters so perfectly.  (He plays a similar purposeless-rich-fellow in Two Weeks Notice, which is also a charming movie, but more contrived than this one).  There is real pain and loneliness in the movie, but they are not at odds with the laughs and the heart.  Great ensemble acting all around.  Most of the comedy stems from character, and the characters are recognizable-- flawed, human, lovable.
""No man is an island""-- was it said by John Donne?  Jon Bon Jovi?  Will wonders early on, watching ""Who wants to be a millionaire.""  His character enjoys being an island that occasionally has ties to the mainland-- he considers himself Ibiza (he pronounces it, hilariously, Ibetha, using a Castilian lisp).  Watching Will enjoy himself connecting to others is comic and yet also as satisfying as any AT&T commercial without being half as maudlin.

The story, based on the novel of Nick Hornby, deals with the twelve-year-old boy Marcus who seems to be too old for his age and the (for his 36 years) too superficial and unsensible Will Freeman. Slowly they get to know each other and (ex)change their characters.
The both actors of these characters were a good choice. Hugh Grant, who plays Will, fits very well in his role, because he is young and seems to be easy-going. Marcus is presented very convincing, too. His mother Fiona is portrayed very funny and weird, like she should be. Unfortunately the character of the girl Ellie, a friend of Marcus, and her problems only play a much minor part than in the book. But more information about her would have blow up the contents of the movie. So the directors Chris and Paul Weitz have taken a good choice of the most important scenes, so that the main idea of Nick Hornby comes out clearly and the plot keeps exciting.

In this case, the book was written by confirmed pop culture and Arsenal Football Club addict Nick Hornby (""High Fidelity""), so the viewer should be advised going in that ""About A Boy"" as a movie had a lot to live up to.
And it just isn't up to the task.  The book was as well-written and as involving as it could have been.  Characters were developed with sufficient depth and the very title of the book (A play of the Nirvana song ""About A Girl"") plays into the plot and taps into the conscience of ""generation X"" by bringing early '90's icon/martyr Kurt Cobain into the story indirectly, yet importantly making him a central point-of-reference.  As a result, the book DOES find itself to be rather dated the further we get from Cobain's death...but that event, so central to the teen angst of the period, made the teen characters seem more legitimately troubled in a way that the movie, perhaps more timeless as a result of parting ways with the book re: the Cobain angle, simply cannot adequately grasp.
Hugh Grant is fantastic in the role of a flawed male lead character that Hornby specializes in writing about, and his interaction with the other characters is alternately well-played and extremely uncomfortable to watch; his performance does make this movie worth a watch, but you would get far more out of the experience by reading the book.

Two guys who you shouldn't really like, that you absolutely love.  I also enjoyed the supporting roles by Rachel Weisz (who's great in EVERYTHING she does) and Toni Collette and of course, Hugh's co-star Nicholas Hoult.

Hugh Grant is type-cast in romatic comedies as fantasy-prince characters. Here, he is another 'light' character, but not boyish, not too good to be true. In fact, he's an unapologetic shallow exploiter of the kind of heart. But there is a GREAT (both large and good) transformation into a real adult human being. And he's not the only character who makes an important and 'good' transformation, growing out of their self delusions, changing from the charicatures that they want to be, to the adults that they must be, through helping others. OK, the message is a little predicable and mushy: no man is an island. But it's delivered in a really funny, realistic and interesting way.

Other wonderful aspects of this movie:

2. It displays wonderfully snide, appropriate, funny and acute comments. A real bravura display of British snideness

1444424,5,B00005JL7Q,"This movie is by far my favorite of 2002!
Hugh Grant plays the funniest character of his career!
And Toni Collette gives an amazing performance!
I was so impressed with this movie when I rented it, I went right out and bought it and watched it again!
Will (hugh grant) is a good looking, womanizing, millionaire, loner who's main priorities in life are himself, buying CD's, watching TV, and making sure that his life stays exactly the way that he wants it.  But, when he invents a 2 year old son in order to meet single-moms, he meets a 12 year old boy named Marcus.  As Will tries to teach Marcus how to be ""cool"", Marcus teaches Will that ""no man is an island"".  Suddenly, Will finds his door wide open to new experiences and lessons.
A great movie. VERY funny, entertaining, heartwarming, with a great cast of good actors!!
Watch it!",1066089600,,837,4.493421052631579
1444425,5,B00005JL7Q,"""About a Boy"" has a problem. Everyone thought it was a chick flick so men stayed away from it in droves. A modest hit in America, it suffered from the perception that it was yet another Hugh Grant movie whose target audience was women.
But, this is a movie for and about guys. It is a movie that does a great job of examining the isolation so many men place themselves in and their relationships to the boys who will follow in their footsteps. Its proof that every boy needs a father in his life.
Will (Hugh Grant) is a man who is living what a lot of us might see as a great life. Thanks to a hit Christmas single written by his father, a record Will happens to hate, Will does not have to work and lives the easygoing life of a bachelor in London. Although not quite rich, he is sufficiently comfortable with his income that he can own a great car, live in a nice apartment, and pretty much do as he pleases. He justifies both his existence and himself by openly admitting he is shallow, somewhat self-centered, and wants to stay that way. Because he is honest about himself he feels everyone should accept him as he is without criticizing him. Will believes that all men are islands and that they do not need strong relationships, so he constantly wanders from relationship-to-relationship with women, enjoying everything but having to break up with them when he tires of them.
Will is introduced to a single mom and pretends to like her child in order to date her. In reality he believes he wants absolutely nothing to do with children. When she breaks up with him because she is not ready for a serious relationship, he believes he has hit upon a new dating tactic: date single mothers who apparently are so tied up in getting their lives in order that they will break up with him.
In order to better pull off the [trick], he pretends to be a single father and joins a group called SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together). On a date with single mom, he meets a young boy, Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), who suffers with being an outcast at school and with having a depressed, sometimes-suicidal mom (Toni Collette), who Will at one point characterizes as ""a barking lunatic.""
Marcus figures out Will's [trick], and sort of blackmails him into letting Marcus hang out at his apartment. Soon, unwillingly at first, Will finds himself trying to help Marcus blend in at school (after Marcus is harassed by other school kids, Will advises that Marcus make himself invisible) and advising him on dealing with girls and many of the problems a boy faces growing up.
Will then actually falls for a single mom (Rachel Weisz) and finds that the only way he can gain her interest is to  pretend to be a father, recruiting Marcus to play the part of son. Unfortunately for Will, he is actually growing emotionally and finds himself, in a strange bout of honesty, admitting he is not a father causing him to return his ""island"" status. Only he now finds he's not too happy with being an island and that he truly feels a bond with Marcus.
He attempts to save Marcus from potential social disaster at a school talent show, serving himself up to ridicule and deflecting all of the catcalls to himself and away from Marcus. Will eventually concludes that maybe he is not just an island, but part of an island chain.
The movie is filled with clever humor and one-liners and Hugh Grant is perfectly suited for the role of Will. In fact, its hard to imagine anyone else in any of the roles in the film; it's perfectly cast. Yes it has a happy ending, but this is not a tear-inducing happy ending, its an ending that seems perfectly suited to those involved without becoming overly emotional or mauldin.
The movie, and book it is based on, are really metaphors for the lives of men. It is a great examination of the isolation that men place on themselves. Marcus is heading down the same road as Will, a life cut off from any real relationships, and it is only in developing what amounts to a father-son relationship that both can find happiness and true growth as men.
Trust me, guys, while women love this film, it most definitely is not a chick flick and should be required viewing for every man who feels alone in the world and afraid of relationships.",1065744000,2,4230,4.514993481095176

1444427,5,B00005JL7Q,"A film by Chris and Paul Weitz
About a Boy is based on the Nick Hornby novel of the same name.  In this movie we meet Will (Hugh Grant).  Will is a single man who lives by himself and has never held a job in his life.  See, Will's father wrote a popular Christmas song and Will is able to live off of the royalties.  He may hate the song, but it allows him to live the life in the manner that he sees fit, which is just as self-centered as you can imagine it would be.  Will is in his late 30's and he went to a single parent's group meeting in the hopes to meet a single parent (he has found they make great temporary girlfriends).  He has to fake having a child to do this and ends up dating one for a little while.  In a round-about way this lets Will meet Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), the young son of Fiona (Toni Collette).  It is better seen than explained how Will and Marcus become friends/associates, but this relationship is central to the entire movie because it affects how Will approaches Rachel (Rachel Weisz), a woman he is very attracted to, and it affects his entire life.
This was a very realistic feeling film and I can't say that there was a real weakness in it.  The heart of the movie is the relationship between Will and Marcus and throughout the movie we can see a transformation of who Will is and who Will is becoming (and wants to become).
I'll be honest, I've never thought much of Hugh Grant as an actor, but I thought that he did a fantastic job in the movie.  Surely this was his best role in his entire career.  I did not expect much out of this movie, but I think it will end up being one of the best movies of 2002.  Some people have called in THE best movie of 2002, but I am not willing to quite go that far.  It is an excellent movie and I would highly recommend it.",1063324800,,1799,4.091168091168091
1444428,4,B00005JL7Q,"This film at first did not pull me in.  It did not seem like a movie I would like.  I am more of a period film, ""Elizabeth""-type movie lover.  But I was surprised.  During the summer, I made a top ten favorite movie list and this definately defeated Pirates of the Carribean.  It was Hugh Grant's finest film to date and the movie that made Toni Collette shine.  Welcome to About A Boy.
This movie focuses on Will, a self-centered, self-proclaimed ""island"" man, meaning he is seperate from the world.  This reason being that he inherits immense amounts of money every time a famous Christmas song, written by his dead father, is sang on television, a movie, etc.  This allows him to be by far the most lazy man in the movies.  He is also quite rude.  It also focuses on a little boy named Marcus with a depressed mother.  And when Will starts to seek single mothers, he and Marcus meet when he goes on a date with a single mother from the group SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together).  He is the son of Toni Collette's character Fiona, who could not go to the gathering and let Marcus go with Will's date.  Soon, when Marcus has some bad experiences at school and at home, they connect and help eachother out in tough situations.
This movie is heart warming and quite funny.  A peticular moment made me laugh excessively when Will was going to his first SPAT meeting.  The women are telling stories about their husbands that have abandoned them.  He narrarates the moment with the quote, ""I can tell you one thing: Men are b**tards.""  The only criticism I would have is the movie's length.  But all in all, it was a great film that I thought deserved a Best Actor nomination for Hugh Grant.  I give this movie four stars and an A-.

Will is a slacker who lives off of the royalties of a Christmas carol that his father wrote in 1958, he does not work, sits at home all day and watches game shows and ""Xena, Warrior Princess"".  He devises a plan to meet women by going to SPAT meetings (Single Parents Alone Together) and pretending he has a 2 year old son.  He does get a date, and seredipitously meets Marcus, an awkward teen whose mother is severely depressed, and has attempted suicide.
Will and Marcus' exchanges are very touching, because you realize that they need each other.  Will's irresponsible selfishness begins to melt away, and Marcus makes a friend.

1444475,5,B00005JL7Q,"While there is a certain modicum of truth that Hugh Grant seems to play the same personality over and over, i.e. being the Cary Grant of this generation, in this particular movie, he shines out in what's possibly his best role to date since Four Weddings And A Funeral.  This isn't solely to his performance of being a self-sufficient selfish loner who can't relate to people who have jobs or families, but the way in which his onscreen narration describes his point-of-view, his philosophy, makes Will an interesting character:  ""Me, I didn't mean anything about anything to anyone, and I knew that guaranteed me a long, depression-free life.""
Will is proud to be an island, particularly the holiday resort Ibiza.  He describes his life as a TV show.  As head of the Will Show, which isn't an ensemble drama, ""people come and go, but it comes down to [him] alone.""
Will tries picking up women at a single parents support group, SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together), and falls for Suzie.  After his mother suffers a depressive spell, Marcus later realizes he needs a backup, and turns to Will, with whom he spends time with after school, thus drastically changing the format of the Will Show.  Without going into too much detail, something drastic happens to the star of the Will Show as well--he becomes more human, more connected, gains a soul, etc.
The one good thing I'm noticing about certain movies is that they bring out the pains of being a kid who doesn't fit in, gets picked on, and tries to but due to external forces, can't.  In Marcus's case, his mother stands out as a ""granola basket case"" as Will describes her, she is vegetarian, and is unaware of the need for kids to fit into their peer group via pop culture.  Even his sudden singing out in class might've been ""cool"" among his peers if it had been something like the Mystikal CD Will gives him for Christmas.  Instead, he is jeered at for singing the Carpenters' ""Rainy Days And Mondays"" in class.
Much of the other supporting actors really bring this movie to life, especially Nicholas Hoult as Marcus and Rachel Weisz as Rachel, a women Will falls for later on.  And Badly Drawn Boy's soft alternative sounds enhance this movie.  In the end, the point is regardless of the kind of life one leads, be it living off royalties, being a single parent, etc., it's whether one has the appropriate backup.  One doesn't have to join the mainland (mainstream) per se, but as a compromise, be part of an archipelago (distinct lifestyles).
There's another subtle message that I might be reading too much into.  Will says he's proud he's an island, but it's a ""sad fact from time to time, I had to visit the mainland.""  I wonder if this is a hidden punch at the UK's isolated geographic position as opposed to the continent, Europe, or even its position over the Euro.  And what about the title?  While About A Boy could well refer to Marcus, who becomes the catalyst in Will's life, it could also be about Will himself, who in his sense of being a blank, might as well be one as well.",1058572800,3,3046,4.602587800369686
1444476,5,B00005JL7Q,"While agreeing with a previous commentator's thumbs-up, I respectfully object to describing Marcus as ""a little boy"".  In my book, an 8-year-old might be ""a little boy.""  Marcus, however, is a strapping twelve on the cusp of adolescence.  He even acquires a girl friend before the credits roll.
This insulting dismissal denies Marcus the sober wisdom and coping skills that he demonstrates, and teaches, in the story.  Life has placed him in rather enenviable circumstances, but in many ways he ""has it together"" better than any other character in the film.  Furthermore, while life inside a wall of estrogen might be tolerable for ""a little boy,"" Marcus is decidedly too old for such imprisonment and needs to break out.  If a habit of condescension towards kids, or whatever else, prevents a viewer from grasping either of these points, it is unfortunate.
This admiration shows even more clearly in the book.  I love this film, but now that I have read the novel, I like it even more and would urge everyone who rated this movie high that they owe it to the source of the whole concept to read what he produced.  You won't regret it.  Although Marcus is somewhat more assertive and occasionally hard-edged in the original, it is by and large a sustained paean to this young man's ethics, good sense and unerring Menschenkeit.
I am generally chary of criticizing films based on novels for not representing them more literally, and far be it from me to downgrade the film from five stars-- but in retrospect, one can see that the events leading up to the ending constitute the weakest section.  They are rather manipulative and incredible and (in the case of Marcus's flouncing out of Will's apartment in a huff) false to his character.  (In the book, he does no such thing, although the dialogue provoking it is in place.  He and Will know each other too well by then.)  This plot development is entirely the film-maker's idea, and it replaces a denouement in the book that is much richer, tying up loose ends and involving a few characters that had been left with merely ornamental roles in the film (especially Marcus's father and his very eccentric girl friend).  One has to wonder why the movie didn't go with it.  Its complexities might have required a few more minutes of screen time, but I for one would not have minded at all, because the rest of it is so great, and so is the novel.",1058313600,2,2392,4.688995215311005

Grant has always been in these kind of movies and always does a good job with what he's given, regardless if it's actually a good movie or not.  But, luckily, About a Boy is one of Grant's better films, more for the comedy than anything else.
The only real flaw about the movie is that Hugh Grant's character is a little too annoying.  Sure, I know that he's supposed to be a little unlikeable, but I think they went a little too far.  Oh well, it doesn't hurt the film too much.

His plan takes an unexpected turn when he unintentionally befriends a misfit 12-year-old boy who is looking for a new husband for his depressed mother.
This has a lot of humor along with the serious theme.  I feel it is realistic because it shows life and people are not always perfect, things don't always work out the way you plan and life as a child is not always happy.

1444505,4,B00005JL7Q,"Will (Hugh Grant) is a charming cad who does not have to do anything but watch television and date pretty women because he has the good fortune of living off the royalties for a catch little Christmas ditty called ""Santa's Super Sleigh,"" written by his father many years ago (Elvis recorded it).  In Will's philosophy, ""a person's life is like a TV show,"" and as far as our hero is concerned he is the star of ""The Will Show,"" which is not, he points out, ""an ensemble drama.""  To those familiar with standard movie plots and attuned to the nuances of script writing, we know that by the end of ""About a Boy"" we will see Will eat those words.
It is become more difficult for Will to keep find women to date, since any and all such relationships have a life expectancy of two months tops.  So he hits upon the idea of dating single mothers because he stumbled upon the great ""truth"" that they are less demanding (i.e., more grateful) and easier to break up with (i.e., they care about their kids more than themselves).  The problem is that in searching for a place where one can increase the statistical probability of finding single women Will comes across a meeting of SPAT (Single Parents, Alone Together).  The only male at the meeting Will cheerfully spins a yard about being abandoned by his wife and having a remarkable 2-year old son named ""Ned.""  This bait hooks Suzie, the first of what Will thinks will be many fish in a sea of plenty.
However, because these single parents make a point of helping each other out (the ""alone together"" idea) Will comes into contact with young Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), whose single mother, Fiona (Toni Collette), is not handling her new life all that well.  Circumstances force Will and Marcus together, and, not surprisingly, the young boy thinks that this would be the person to pull his mother out of her depression and make them a family.
What makes ""About a Boy"" and above average film is that while such an end point might be what the story has set up and what convention would insist should come to pass, that is not what happens in the end here.  In fact, the ending is much more satisfying than that predictable conclusion.  The main thing is that whereas ""Ned"" is a great help to a preying bachelor, having the real article hanging around your apartment is not at all helpful.  Of course, eventually all this contact with the boy engenders real feelings in Will and when he meets Rachel (Rachel Weisz), he is confronted by a woman who is too good for him.  Does having a real ""fake"" son work better than having just a car seat littered with cracker crumbs?
Ultimately the chief attraction of this film is watching the two main characters transform themselves into the possibilities of better people.  Marcus has an advantage because he is more mature, yet it is when we get a sense of honesty from Will, either when talking to himself or to another person, that we know we did not make a mistake in wanting the character to find happiness.  My taste in Hugh Grant films lends itself towards the ""Notting Hill"" and ""Sense & Sensibility"" direction than ""Mickey Blue Eyes"" or ""Two Weeks Notice,"" but ""About a Boy"" ends up at least in the middle adn is therefore quite acceptable.  Hard to believe this 2002 film was directed by the same guy(s) who did ""American Pie,"" which reminds me that the biggest laugh on the DVD is probably in the deleted scenes where we learn who else besides Elvis recorded ""Santa's Super Sleigh.""",1054252800,3,3472,4.579032258064516

The transition between scenes has a great pace and the playout of the evolving fatherlike relationship Will begins to have over Marcus is shown with heart. Hugh Grant handles the part of Will with charm. He showed a great performance. Nicholas Hoult as Marcus was a great choice for the role. I hope the kid has much more opportunities in his future; however they'll probably be British productions. Toni Collette (Very quirky in an off way in this film) and the beautiful Rachel Weisz also costar.
 The DVD is a hefty one. Picture and audio transfers are great. The supplemental material is satisfying. Especially neat is the ""English to English"" which is a featurette on British slang.
 About A Boy succeeded to be touching and enjoyable as both a book and a movie. The two make a perfect pair, although I suggest reading the book before the movie. Or perhaps not, for more effect on the film. Either way, they're both wonderful.",1053907200,,1639,4.644827586206897
1444507,4,B00005JL7Q,"Co- produced by Robert De Niro, and executive produced by Nick Hornby, who wrote the novel on which the movie is based; ABOUT A BOY is a comedy drama which manages to avoid falling into the sentimentality tar pit.
Will Freeman (Hugh Grant- delivering another good performance after his acting stretch in BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY) is a man in his late 30s with no adult responsibilities at all. His life is all work and no play, an enviable barrage of fast cars and casual sex; but when Will is befriended by a geeky 12 year old boy named Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) after Will saves him from being beaten to a pulp by school bullies, the pair gradually form a special bond. For the first time, Will learns the importance of thinking of other people's feelings and needs; and as a result of this new friendship Will who lives with his strictly vegan mother (Toni Collette), another one of those left-wing ""Meat is murder"" clowns; gets to eat meat as well as being exposed to other delights he has been sheltered from like profanity laden music; as well as earning a healthy dose of self-esteem; which in the end nearly proves to be his undoing...
Hoult and Collette both give excellent performances as well. ABOUT A BOY is by turns sad and funny. My only complaint is the typical Hollywood quick fix ending, which is totally unrealistic. But that's just Hollywood, isn't it? Well worth a gander.",1053734400,,1387,4.642276422764228
1444508,5,B00005JL7Q,"Hugh Grant plays a far more complex character than his usual charming British bachelors. Yes he is single again in this movie and yes he lives in London. And yes he is showing a ""darker"" side of himself as he did in ""Bridget Jones"" (which I loved).
However, this movie is darker and deeper than his previous ""famous"" films (I have seen him in more serious fare from his younger days, but those films have been neglected by the mainstream.)
""About a Boy"" recounts the relationship between a lonely, misfit adolescent male and an isolated bachelor. There is humor-most of it delivered by Grant. And there is poignancy-particularly in the performance of Toni Colette, who plays the boy's suicidal, hippie mother. All of the performances are wonderful-Grant, the young boy, Toni Colette, Rachel Weisz-and the cast plays off each other beautifully. In addition, the story resembles real life and not your formulaic romantic comedy-Grant meets and dates one woman, who leads him to the boy and his mother, who eventually lead him to another woman that he dates-instead of just your standard boy meets just one girl at the beginning of the movie and ends up with her by the closing credits.
I would recommend this movie for fans of comedy and of romance, though this isn't a romantic comedy. I also would recommend this movie for lovers of Nick Hornby's work, the author on whose book the movie was based. Of course if you're a Hugh Grant fan, you'll love it. If you don't like Hugh Grant-and I know many men a few women who loathe him-he is more palatable in this movie. But, of course, he is still Hugh Grant-and that's great for many people like myself, and unacceptable for others!

The story portrays the evolution of a self-absorbed bachelor who is taught a life-changing lesson by a twelve-year-old whose mom is walking a thin line between sanity and committing suicide. In the process, both (the kid and Grant) learn from each other, and find inside of them things they didn't know they could be capable of. All in all, warm and human, very touching.

This movie was a great coming of age story that showed the insecurites we all live through in our teenage years and how they still affect us in our adult lives.  Hugh Grant played a great carefree playboy, Will, who didn't appear to have any frustrations in life other than who his next conquest would be.  This all changes when he meets Marcus, a boy seriously in need of a stable adult presence in his life.  Marcus is a teenager who is faced with the same teenage problems we all were faced with, being the odd one at school and having a vegitarian sucidal mother who will not let him eat McDonalds.

1444542,5,B00005JL7Q,"I like watching Hugh Grant onscreen - raffish and intellectual and slightly off beat and the trailers and excellent reviews conviced me to see this movie. And it was worth it.
However --- it was billed and presented as some form of romantic comedy but it really is ""About a Boy"". I would say that the true star of the movie is Nicholas Hoult. The gist of the movie is given elsewhere in these pages so I won't bore with a repetition but Rachel Weisz only gets around 15 minutes of screen time and Toni Colletes nutty mother early on is removed as a romantic interest.
 The real relationship here is all between Grant and Hoult with Hoult providing the driving force. His loping walk, strong stare and stunningly innocent smile are played to perfection and demonstrate both his need to find his place in the world and to drag his mother along with him. He forces Grant to accept him, forces him to face himself and is transformed in the process. Hoult takes an almost tragic figure and gives him life, humor and grace. Hugh Grant is good too.

About a Boy is as warm as it is funny.  It manages to be entertaining and thought-provoking at the same time.  In addition to Hugh Grant and Nicholas Hoult (Marcus), the supporting cast of Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz give a fine performance.
It is definitely a DVD to buy and watch over and over.",1051660800,,632,4.761467889908257
1444545,5,B00005JL7Q,"Hugh Grant is one of my favorite film performers.  Notice I don't say ""actor.""  He doesn't really act, per se, since he's always riffing on basically the same character...usually with varying degrees of charming, slightly goofy befuddlement (NOTTING HILL, 9 MONTHS) or charm barely concealing nastiness (BRIDGET JONES).  In a film such as EXTREME MEASURES, where he played a doctor turned amateur sleuth, he just wasn't convincing.
So much of his success lies with his ability to pick roles tailor made for him, such as in 4 WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL.  He's an intelligent leading man with impeccable comedic delivery.  When the material written for him is good, he is GREAT.  When it's mediocre, he's only OK to watch.
ABOUT A BOY is the best script he's had to date (well, maybe 4 WEDDINGS is...hard to say).  He plays a rich, single lout who lives only to indulge himself and score with women.  He truly only thinks of his own pleasures...most of which are remarkably humdrum.  He's not a creep or pervert or hedonist, really, he's just monumentally self-indulgent.  He didn't even earn his fortune, he inherited it.
One day, he gets the bright idea of meeting women by joining a single-parent's support group.  He'll just pretend to be a single father, and all the single women who will greatly outnumber him will fall all over themselves over him.  AND HE'S RIGHT!!!
But this is just where the movie gets started. Through a series of events involving trying to keep his secret just that, he ends up being stuck with a teenaged boy who is awkward and fatherless and extremely nerdy who also takes a liking for Grant and starts showing up at his apartment door every afternoon to watch TV.  Grant can't get rid of him...it's a kind of mild blackmail situation.  But slowly, slowly, slowly, the two begin to bond.  Grant, through sheer annoyance, begins to bully the kid into being less of a schlep.  And this tiny kernel of interest in another human being slowly begins to gnaw away at Grant's insular world.  He's upset by the changes he sees in himself, but he also becomes enchanted with the unique feeling of actually making an impression on others.
The movie is very funny and has lots of near farcical situations.  The laughs are never cheap, though, and most of the humor is character driven.  It's not an action packed film, but I laughed outloud at LOTS of it...Grant's delivery has never been better.  But it was also moving, but in a very non-Hollywood, tear-jerking way.  The viewer is nearly as startled as Grant's character to see that we've grown to really care about the main characters.
This is a terrific, moving comedy.  Every character is fully realized, even if only on screen for a scene or two.  It's beautifully filmed in London and there's not one moment where you feel you're watching an American movie.  It feels British through and through  (how weird for a film directed and produced by the brothers who brought us AMERICAN PIE...another movie that had surprising touches of drama that actually worked).  It's a sophisticated movie, sure to be hated by most kids...not that kids ever go to Hugh Grant movies anyway.  But for intelligent adults looking for a great two hours, with a story unlike any seen before, CHECK IT OUT!!  Highly, highly recommended.",1051056000,5,3284,4.785079928952043

After a second (and third, and fourth) viewing however, I look back and don't understand why I couldn't recognize it as the truly great movie that it is. There is a ton of dry, high brow humor here. Hugh Grant remains the cinema king of light hearted humor... But let's hope he goes back to playing more likeable characters, which is what we know him best for.",1050969600,,485,4.225806451612903
1444547,4,B00005JL7Q,"This movie has been pegged as a romantic comedy, but it's actually more of a comedy/drama.  While there is romance, that does not come until later in the film and there's so much more to this film than that.  After seeing as much as I could stand of Bridget Jones' Diary, and hearing that the same writer wrote the story that this film was based on, I was skeptical even though Hugh Grant was in it.  I like Hugh Grant.  I think his comedic timing is fantastic, he rates very high on the charm scale, he's not bad to look at, and that accent is to die for.  HOWEVER, Bridget Jones' Diary appeared to be a mistake for Mr. Grant in my eyes.  Alas, curiosity won over, I couldn't resist, and I watched About A Boy anyway.  I was pleasantly surprised!  This movie was full of humor, intelligent humor as well as below the belt humor. Hugh was a pleasure to watch in this film that seemed to be tailored to him, for what we know of the real life Grant. Grant plays a shallow, womanizing, self-proclaimed forever bachelor who has no interest in children.  Enter a boy.  Enter a troubled boy from a troubled home who has a bit of social trouble at school. Grant, being nothing if not rich and suave, winds up helping this boy that he initially wanted nothing to do with.  Along the way, he does find romance and he finds himself -- a new and improved self.  He also manages to make a difference in the lives of the other lead characters.  All in all, this one is definitely worth a watch if not an own.  If you're a fan of Grant's charm and humor in movies like Nine Months and Notting Hill, you won't be disappointed.",1050537600,5,1611,4.273927392739274
1444548,5,B00005JL7Q,"The success of this unquestionably charming film lies in its casting. Hugh Grant, Toni Collett and Nicholas Hoult are each obscenely talented in their own right and posess a spot-on grasp of their characters. Hoult's portrayal of the awkward and introspective Marcus is particularly sharp: a shy and authentic misfit whose only real human connection is with his emotionally unbalanced mother. That is of course until he meets Will (Hugh Grant) an emotionally unavailable thirty something that has no time in his life for the troubles of a young boy.  Grant's character is an entertaining cross between the devilishly sly character he played in Bridget Jones and the adorable geek he played in Notting Hill.
What's wonderfully rare about this film is that it's touching without being the least bit overdone or precious. Through dealing with issues brought up by Marcus' mothers attempted suicide and Grant's relationship with his deceased father and issues of emotional isolation the film holds on to its sense of humor and charm. 'About a Boy' never tries to be what its not and as a result turns out to be a paradoxically heartbreaking and hilarious film that you'll want to watch over and over.
Badly Drawn Boy's terrific soundtrack and the direction of Paul and Chris Weitz (perhaps most famous for the `American Pie' Trilogy) are also part of the film's strong points.",1050537600,,1372,5.017543859649122
1444549,5,B00005JL7Q,"About a Boy was the best comedy of 2002 if you want to call such a thoughtful movie a comedy.  Hugh Grant is very winning playing this less than winning character developing character contrary to his best instincts.  Grant has no life and yet the perfect life doing what ever he pleases at any moment of the day.  He dates whomever and wastes time watching game shows.  Living on an inheritance, Grant doesn't much care for anything but spending money and being a bum.  Through circumstances that were supposed to get him eager women with no strings attached, he becomes attached to a 12 year-old kid who needs his help.  At first, Grant ignores the kid, but the kid persists and Grant becomes more involved than he ever intended to.  Eventually his real devotion of the kid makes him the human being he was trying not to become.
It's a great movie because it is both funny and it has an important lesson.  The characters are stereotypes.  They do things that you wouldn't predict.  Where the movie is supposed to be warm and fuzzy it is actually realistic and not so neat.

His cynical strategy backfires when he recruits the misfit son of a suicidal mother to pose as his own son, (which I might add is quite humorous)and proving his parental prowess to his latest single-mom target (alos a classic moment).

1444641,5,B00005JL7Q,"Not since 1996, when Hugh Grant donned a doctor's jacket and turned serious in ""Extreme Measures,"" has there ever been a picture that would allow me to accept this mannered British actor -- as being not much more than an OK leading man with floppy hair -- who would forever play the same character in one flimsy crowd-pleasing comedy after another.
Until now.  ""About A Boy"" goes so much further to enhance Hugh Grant's career than even that ""villain"" he played in ""Bridget Jones Diary.""  Hands down, this is Grant's best career performance.  Though his high English accent is still present, he dumps his standard tics and stuttering, adding greater meaning to the phrase, ""irresponsible and intellectual louse.""
Some elements in this picture seem to follow a formula, e.g., idiot fop remains an idiot, kid enters picture, so do a couple of women, idiot fop wakes up.  But there's more going on in this observational comedy-drama.  It feels authentic.
Set entirely in Great Britain, Grant plays a guy who does absolutely nothing.  He lives off royalties from some horrific Christmas ditty everybody loves that was written by his father, who's dead.  No commitments, no shackles; he's a man who loves to juggle girls and lies.  He's not a stupid man, as is apparent by how he strings sentences in his narration.  He just doesn't give a damn.
Without giving away how his transformation occurs, there is some true-to-the-heart revelations that are believable to anyone who has gone through 'em -- which means most of us -- albeit at a much earlier age than the character played by Hugh Grant (in this film, he's pushing 40).  That it comes to this guy so late makes his reactions all the more precious and rewarding.
What I like most about this film is its rich characters in a dramatic script that draws fine humor from bad situations.  This humor, for the most part, doesn't stretch to push a joke that's out of place.  This keeps the tonality of the picture consistent and engrossing.  (Think of that restaurant scene in ""When Harry Met Sally"" and you know what I'm talking about when I say I have no tolerance for something that gets a big laugh but is stupidly ""out of place"" with a tone established 30 minutes before.)
You think you've seen your share of ""bachelor"" stories?  Well here's one that allows you to smirk and laugh without feeling patronized or contempt by a endless string of cheap sit-com lines.
Hugh Grant's ""Will"" displays the type of ""intellectual"" befuddlement that is believable by virtue of his knowledge of arts and history, but with complete ignorance about a life outside night clubs and his 21st century-equipped bachelor ""flat.""  He only cares, when we meet him, about pleasure, as expressed in elapsed periods of time he calls ""units.""  Beyond self-centered, he's still charming, given how brutally honest he can be about how awful he's perceived by the world.  When he handles a baby, it's just a ""thing"" to him.  An animal, a pet, would be more endearing to him.  But he's only selectively honest.  His pursuit of pleasure, his demand to live for ""the moment,"" requires ""lies"" to achieve success as he sees it.
Then in walks this smart kid named ""Marcus,"" wonderfully played by Nicholas Hoult.  He carries the other half of the picture.  So expressive, wiser beyond his years, yet so used to be picked on, so eager to please his suicidal but loving hippie mother, played by the always fabulous Toni Collette (Muriel's Wedding, The Sixth Sense, The Hours).
Of course there's a love interest, and it's not Toni Collette.  It turns out to be someone else.  While there are some goofy moments that could've been clipped here and there, on the whole, there are few false notes here.  All of the character actors play off each other well, and they raise Grant's performance to higher levels.  Finally, a Hugh Grant picture that makes best use of Hugh Grant; and the script is everything, based in part on the hit novel by Nick Hornby.
I'm certain if this film had been released in the winter of 2002, Grant would be up for an Oscar and his film would be among the nominees for Best Picture.  It has a snappy visual style and tempo, as well as a soundtrack that is perfect.
Some report mixed emotions with the end of the picture.  I think this has to do with wanting air-tight closure.  It's not quite there but I was still satisfied; in the end, because you've invested so much in these characters, because you haven't been bored for a second, because you haven't seen an endless barrage of cliches -- you don't want this story to end.  You want to keep going to see what happens, despite getting hint of a mild uplift in the last frame.  This is the best feeling to have.  Keep you wanting more.
Finally, I love how ""About a Boy"" isn't just about the boy Marcus (Nicholas Hoult).  It's also about Will (Hugh Grant).  Will ""Will"" ever grow up?  Maybe, maybe not.  Watch this to find out.",1045612800,4,4912,4.6841491841491845
1444642,5,B00005JL7Q,"Heartwarming studio chickflick about Hugh Grant bonding with a little boy...this description didn't send me rushing to the cinema, despite the Nick Hornsby brand. But shockingly, About a Boy isn't a standard Hollywood prefab romcom or sentimental twaddle -- it's an actual film, sharply written, evocatively directed, beautifully acted.
The caustic British wit immediately sets the film apart from its studio comedy brethren -- its actually, frequently funny. The characters feel real, lived in. The superb dual voiceover is potent rebuke to those still peddling the convential wisdom that vo's are ""uncinematic"" (if this includes you you're immediately assigned ""Election"" and ""Adaptation""), working comfortably inside our protagonists' heads without any dreaded 'literary' staining, bringing their vibrant inner lives to comic life.
So instead of the false life lessons and maudlin sentimentality films of this sort so often trade in, we get a moving, witty story about...okay, yeah...Hugh Grant bonding with a little boy. But that's no reason not to rent it.
The widescreen picture is gorgeous (another nice departure from drearily filmed studio comedies) and the disc comes with numerous, lengthy deleted scenes that are virtually all terrific, and well worth viewing.",1045440000,60,1272,5.630208333333333
1444643,5,B00005JL7Q,"This movie has just moved onto my all time favorite list.  The plot is unique, touching, interesting and never gets boring.
While I am not a major Hugh Grant fan, I think that he is endearing, and  real, in this film.  As a 38 year old bachelor, it is clear that ""island living"" has isolated him from almost all the love and meaning that life has to offer.  (Think, ""no man is an island."")  Through the course of the movie, he becomes entwined in the lives of others, and he finally finds that life on a (deserted) island may be a little lonely after all.
The supporting cast, as in many British movies, are very real and provide depth and interest to the film.  Marcus and his mother are both delightfully complex.
Great characters, insightful story, no violence, no slapstick, no gratuitous sex, and plenty of quirky plot devices all contribute to make this a new favorite.",1045440000,,875,4.54140127388535
1444644,4,B00005JL7Q,"I was certainly surprised about this one. About a Boy is a fantastic story paralleling the lives of a grown man (Hugh Grant) and a young boy.
Now, being no Hugh Grant fan, I thought his presence in the film would be a great distraction all the way through, even if the story was good. But Grant manages to become his character, a listless man living off the royalties of his father's one hit wonder. I forgot the actor and was tricked into seeing the character, and the results opened my eyes to a fantastic film.
What really makes this film work (aside from Grant's performance) is how it parallels the lives of Grant and the young boy, who keeps coming by his apartment uninvited looking for a father figure. Cutting from one shot of the boy doing or thinking (in voice over) one thing to Grant doing or thinking the same thing works splendidly. There are plenty of laughs, as well as feel-good moments in the film, without ever getting melodramatic or cheesy. It treads that fine line meticulously, and comes out a clear winner in the end.
The music is well placed amongst the visuals of the film. Instead of taking current pop hits picked for their popularity, the songs have a direct correlation to the plot and situations, combining music and visuals in perfect harmony. The supporting cast, including Toni Collette (The Sixth Sense) is equally fantastic.
The film is a complete joy from beginning to end. If you're tired of manipulative feel good (or feel sad) films, check out this refreshingly good movie. Highly recommended.",1045440000,,1534,4.70631970260223
1444645,3,B00005JL7Q,"i saw this movie a week ago. The movie's really just about a guy who's selfish and charmless, and has no feelings for kids. He is 38 living a pretty cool life not having to do any work since his rich, and he has never had a relationship lasting over 2 month. One day he finds a sign in a shopping center saying single parents night. He decides to go there. All the people there have children and they are looking for a guy with a kid, so ofcourse he lies and says he has a kid, and he ended up gettin a partener. Not long he and his partener decided to go on a stroll down the park so they did, and the lady brand her baby and her friends son on a walk since her friend was in a bad condition. The boy was feeding the fish and he than threw the whole bred on a duck and actually killed it so they went back home. As they went back to drop off the boy they saw his mum unconsioused from trying to kill herself so they got an ambulance and went to hospital. Not long after the boy starts to becomes friends the selfish guy and the guy actually has feelings for the poor boy and buys him some fashionable stuff like that he won't get bullied. Theres more to the movie but i don't want to rewn it in case you want to see it. Any way overall this was a good film with a fair bit of comedy but it had some boring bits. Any way a fair acting from hugh grant who i don't personally like as an actor but this film he did good. If you like romance you would may aswell watch it and if your a fan of hugh grant then RENT IT!!! BUY IT!!! Any well just to make it more simple heres a rating out of ten for the story, comedy, romance etc.
story plot:8(great story)  comedy:5(had some funny bits)  action:0  romance:7(pretty romantic)  sadness:8(sad yes)
To be honest i really recomend this movie for little kids and older people, its stupid they rate it M15 because so it had the theme where the boys mum tried to kill herself but the romance and the ending makes up for it oh well any way my opinion good movie!!! and if you have kids go rent it!!!should be PG!!!",1045180800,,2050,4.017156862745098

A hilarious comedy that piercingly dissects family quirks, friendships and relationships. Hugh Grant exudes a cavalier charm as Will who finds himself gravitating to the young Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) in their pretense as father-and-son to impress on his love-interest (Rachel Weisz). Marcus, in the process of avoiding his suicidial-prone mother (Toni Collette) finds Will a surrogate daddy-figure. Their affecting screen chemistry graces the excellent adaptation and direction by Chris and Paul Weitz of American Pie fame. Punctuated with provoking dialogues edged with sarcasm and rapier wits, About A Boy is an earnest comedy of dysfunctional families, dislocated society and humanity that is cuttingly poignant and sharply observant.",1045008000,,840,5.674603174603175

Hugh Grant (the initial attraction for me) does a terrific job portraying a single man who seems as if he's trying to convince himself that he is happy with his lonely and disconnected existence. He reluctantly becomes involved as a father figure to a 12-year-old misfit of a boy, and discovers that he has a knack for helping this kid through some troubled times (at school and at home).  Even my husband, who frowned when I didn't return from the video store with ""The Bourne Identity"", confessed that he really enjoyed this movie.  I think he (and a lot of other men) can relate to the main character's feeling that he was an ""island"" but is now part of an ""island chain"". :)",1044921600,,794,4.417808219178082
1444648,4,B00005JL7Q,"About a Boy is one of those films that gets better the more times you watch it.  It's so funny you can't laugh at half the jokes because you are still chuckling from the last one.  Yet About a Boy is more than just a bunch of punch lines strung together, this film touches on some serious issues, but in a manner that never seems pretentious.
Will (Hugh Grant) is in his late 30's and doesn't really care about anyone or anything but himself.  Attempting to meet single mothers (although he hates kids, he thinks single mothers are desparate) he accidentally falls in with a boy named Marcus (Nicholas Hoult).  Slowly the two begin a friendship that will be the most important relationship either has ever had.
I don't want to say much more than that.  This story is endlessly charming.  American Pie directors Paul and Chris Weitz have fashioned a magnificent film out of Nick Hornby's material.  And how well does Hugh Grant fill out this role?  Charming, witty, and hopelessly self-absorbed, he is fantastic as Will, the guy you know you shouldn't like, but do anyway.
All the supporting players are great too.  Toni Collette is amazing as Marcus's misfit mother and few child actors come off better than Nicholas Hoult does here.  I really enjoyed this one.",1044835200,2,1261,4.6909090909090905

  It is funny, moving, and Hugh Grant fits his part perfectly.
  On the whole, I wouldn't say it is on par with High Fidelity with John Cusak, the other film based on Hornby's work, but it is very entertaining nonetheless.

Not only has the movie logo been destroyed and placed horizontally, but do we have to have giant quotes all over the front of the box?  Isn't that normally reserved for the back?
I understand that in this day and age of over-marketing, any chance  you get to get someone to buy your product is more important than the integrity of the product.  And that is why giant quotes and huge, uneccessary type adorns most DVD and music releases.  But why can't that be placed on the back of the package or on a sticker.

""Clones"" probably made 3 times what this one made, proving once again that there's no justice in the world. Though I saw both movies, it's ""About a Boy"" that will continue to charm those who get the DVD.  My definition of great comedy is being able to watch a scene over and over and still laugh like a loon, even though you know the joke is coming.  By that definition, ""About a Boy"" is a smashing success and proof that not all summer movie releases are driven by special effects, rather than story.

Hugh Grant takes his ""shtick"", such that it is, and uses it to fill out a fairly detailed character. It's completely three-dimensional. By the end of the movie, you feel you yourself could answer totally unrelated questions about this character...like what would be his political views? Beatles or Presley? Big Mac or McChicken?
The boy never once seems to be acting, and is laugh-out-loud funny. He tosses them off almost like afterthoughts, yet you'll pause-and-""rewind"" just to hear his delivery over and over again.
The superlative screenplay, and the surprising zippy direction from the Weitz brothers (""American Pie"" to this? Wow.) will have non-cineastes noticing.
One last thing. The soundtrack is sheer perfection, by a guy named Badly Drawn Boy. It's evocative but not intrusive, classic/retro-sounding yet totally modern and contemporary, and hummable beyond belief.

1444741,5,B00005JL7Q,"""About a Boy"" is a great romantic comedy based on Nick Hornby's best-selling novel. [I haven't read it.] It's not an ordinary entry in its genre because of its points of view [those of an eleven year old boy who's old for his years and a thirty-eight year old man who's never grown up] and its refusal to follow the normal boy-gets-girl formula. The story could easily have veered into the maudlin and sentimental, but directing brothers Chris and Paul Wiesz [""American Pie""] inject wit and often acerbic humor at just the right moments.
Will [Hugh Grant] lives off the royalties from a hit song his decesased father wrote. He keeps telling himself that the axiom `No man is an island' is no longer true in our world filled with technological marvels. He uses his money to live well and his good looks to get women. One day he discovers the world of single mothers and decides to invent a child of his own in order to charm these women. The plan works well enough at first, but when he meets a lonely boy [Nicholas Hoult] and his depressed mom [Toni Colette], he finds himself in a situation where, for the first time in his life, someone else's happiness might be more important than his own.
Hugh Grant is an acting treasure. The movies today are filled with plenty of tough guys and rough guys, sweet ones and soft ones. Grant is one of the few actors around who are charming, funny and sophisticated in a loveable bad boy way. This may be his best performance to date - other contenders include ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" and ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"". Newcomer Nicholas Hoult is great, playing the boy as eccentric and worldly wise rather than as cute and cuddly. Toni Colette plays his mother and is superb as always.
There have been several decent romantic comedies in the last year or so, but ""About a Boy"" is one of the few I can describe as ""Brilliant!""",1042675200,,1864,4.534124629080119
1444742,4,B00005JL7Q,"I must admit I have never been much of a Hugh Grant fan.  It seems to me that in most of his previous movies he plays the same stuttering lout who is more or less likeable or not likeable and who you really don't ever get to know.  These characters are primarily two-dimensional creations used to move a plot along.
In About a Boy something different happens.  Yes, Grant plays a man who is primarily a layabout lout who pretends to have a son in order to score with the women at the local single parent's group.  On a parallel course, a boy with a suicidal mom (Toni Collete) seems drawn to Grant and their paths converge.  But Grant's character seems to exist outside the movie plot, and although in retrospect the plot may be somewhat predictable, I found that while watching the movie I was so engrossed in the arc of Grant's character I really didn't have any of those irritating stray thoughts that throw you out of the movie by telling you where it is going.  The story here is stronger than the usual Grant vehicle, and he rises to it by turning in the most complex  performance of his career so far.  I really liked this movie.

I didn't buy it, but at the same time realized that it would have been hard to get a good ""Hollywood"" type climax from the book in the first place, so I rented the DVD really hoping to gain some insight into how and why the movie version ended as it did.
My first reaction to the director's commentary is that they really make you feel as if they'd rather not be watching the movie again and they can't imagine why we are even bothering to watch it with their commentary - the comments given during the deleted scenes bonus feature really cement this impression - BTW, seems to me they left out a scene at the end which would have been better left in.
As for why they changed the ending, they really don't say, the only reflection upon the changed ending being a reference to a New Yorker critic who said it was horrible  and then a slight against that same critic later in the scene when they more or less question what type of human being could find the scene ""horrible.""
Personally, I wouldn't say the ending is horrible, but it is a disappointment, especially given the quality of the cast and of the original story.  I'd recommend the book over the movie, along with everything else Nick Hornby has written, but would add that in my opinion ""High Fidelity"" was extremely well done - perhaps the best book to film transformation I've ever seen.",1042588800,2,1685,4.3428571428571425

I was wrong.
Matching moments of true horror involving attempted suicide at the film's beginning with Grant's continuing snarky, sarcastic voiceover showed that the directors had found the precise balance necessary to make the film work. It's a heartwarming, occasionally edgy film about the human need for others and about how a family - whether one we're born into or one that we create for ourselves - can help us grow.

Oh yeah, he also has a seemingly endless supply of money. He also like to meet woman, something that he thinks, could be aided if he attends a help group for single parents. Grant does get lucky and meets an attractive woman, played by Rachel Weisz. His date with Weisz's character sets up the entire movie.

1444761,5,B00005JL7Q,"I had high expectations when I heard that Nick Hornby's wonderful novel ""High Fidelity"" was being made into a film.  However, I was very disappointed that the film removed the protagonist out of London and into Chicago.  The London setting was part of the charm of the book, and turned a wonderful novel with a wonderful story into a mediocre film.  So it was with trepidation that I greeted the news of yet another Hornby novel, ""About a Boy,"" being adapted for film.  I was pleasantly surprised when the film turned out to be every bit as good as the book.  If you are a Hornby fan who was dissapointed with the Americanization of ""High Fidelity"" rest assured that this film retains it's English charm and self deprecating humour.  Highly recommended!",1041724800,8,753,4.709923664122138
1444762,5,B00005JL7Q,"In yet another year where comedies have been painfully dominated by the sort of sophomoric gross-out humor revitalized by ""American Pie,"" ""About a Boy"" was a real standout. (Ironically, it's  directed by the Weitz brothers, who also directed ""American Pie."" Go figure.) Based on the novel by Nick Hornby (""High Fidelity""), Hugh Grant (""Four Weddings and a Funeral"") plays a confirmed bachelor with no real human connections, no job, and no need for one (he's independently wealthy, and it's a humorous twist when you find out why). His world changes when he meets a single mother (Toni Collette, ""The Sixth Sense"") and her young son (standout newcomer Nicholas Hoult) that start to put a little perspective to his world.
In any other writer's hands this would have turned into a sappy romance between Grant and Collette, but that never happens here. The movie is, instead, about Grant and Hoult and how their unlikely friendship shapes them both. Plus it's just really funny, and never what you'd expect.",1040169600,6,1004,5.0119760479041915

The opening credits to a fantastic movie.
This movie labled in our local cinema is put in the genre of Romantic Comedy...But it's much more than that. It is a coming of age movie, for both a boy and a man. Will is a 38 year old male equivelant of a spinster who has never had a job in his life and lives off of the royalties of his fathers only song. When he meets 12 year old Marcus, he descovers more about deep and meaningfull relationships, and living life to the full. Marcus learns about men and what to be when he grows up and tries to understand Wills view of life. With a briliant soundtrack by Badly Drawn Boy, and a fantastic cast and writers, this movie is well worth the top shelf in your DVD collection.",1036108800,3,806,4.240259740259741
1444764,4,B00005JL7Q,"I am not particularly a big fan of Hugh Grant's, but he was outstanding in this entertaining movie. The script and the cast were just terrific, as was the sound track.
Grant plays Will, the shallow, self-centered recipient of an inheritance that allows him to live a life of leisure without working. He is at his most charming when he is asked what he does and gets one of those ""aw shucks"" looks before admitting that he does....nothing. He resorts to going to a single-parents' meeting and inventing a son in order to meet a woman. In the meantime, he forms a reluctant friendship with Marcus, an odd young boy whose mother is raising him alone. This relationship with Marcus is the heart of the movie and is the basis for Will's coming of age..
Other reviewers have gone into the story-line of the movie more than adequately, so I don't need to do that again.
This is a fresh take on an old theme with characters you can like and a lot of laughs. How this all comes together is delightful, which is a credit to all who worked on this film. There is no preaching about the insignificance of Will's self-indulgent life....and Grant's portrayal of Will makes him very likeable despite his flaws.
I enjoyed this film for its entertainment value ....it made me laugh, which is just what I wanted.",1035504000,,1294,4.55793991416309
1444765,5,B00005JL7Q,"Who knew the guys who made American Pie could also direct something as thoughtful and smart as About a Boy? In many ways superior to the still really awesome book, Hugh Grant turns in his most nuanced performace as Will, the selfish protagonist. The use of Badly Drawn Boy's score excellently punctuates a funny yet realistic script. Not to be missed!",1035072000,,351,4.770491803278689
1444766,5,B00005JL7Q,"I read the book ""About a Boy"" over a year ago, and found it mildly entertaining.  Then my best friend needed someone to see the movie with while her husband watched ""Attack of the Clones"" and I was lucky enough to be her only friend without plans.  Man, am I ever glad I didn't have plans.  This movie is hilarious, and if you've read the book before seeing the movie, read it again afterwards.  This is the only case I've ever encountered of a movie actually making the book more entertaining.  The few tweaks made in the film adaptation fit perfectly, and it is obvious that the filmmakers didn't add or subtract anything that wasn't absolutely necessary.  Altogether, this is one of the finest films I've seen in my scant 22 years.",1034121600,,734,4.5227272727272725
1444767,3,B00005JL7Q,"If you want an amusing time at the movies, you could certainly do worse than to see this lightweight comedy. All the reviews seem to be saying that Hugh Grant plays an irresponsible and immature character, self-absorbed and without any committment to values, who learns to be more responsible through a quirk of fate that thrusts him with a 12-year old boy who helps redeem him. But actually this movie doesn't really base itself on such a moral high ground as to be so preachy as reviewers seem to want to paint it. Grant's character is really a Londoner who doesn't at first bond closely with others, but proves to have a kind streak as the story goes on. None of the other characters in the movie really at any point tower above him as paragons of virtue; any lack of well-directed values in the movie seem to reflect generally the culture of London (at least as portrayed in this film) as much as they reflect his character. Perhaps this presumed typecasting of Hugh Grant reflects less about the characters he plays than about the way he just can't manage to live down the fallout from the time he was caught cheating on Elizabeth Hurley (who scarcely ever put forth a more likelable on-screen persona than his, for that matter). I'm not going to say that all movies should reflect Christian values, but Christians might have a point in noting that Christmas is made an important symbol herein, and while Christams is at its root a Christian holiday, no specifically Christian values whatsoever are reflected here. But Christian or otherwise, I found no clear moral direction in any character at any time to justify calling Grant's character particularly valuless by comparison. Anyhow, his bonding with the twelve-year old comes through Grant's character's invention of a fake son of his own to try to make a better impression on women who are single parents like he pretends to be. Greater involvent with the twelve-year-old begins when Grant's character and he discover that the latter's mother has attempted suicide. The relationship grows from there and is a mutual learning experience. But neither of these two guys is a saint single-handedly redeeming the other; the kid can in fact be demanding and a bit bratty at times. As for the part about masquerading as a parent to try to have better luck courting ""other"" single parents, well his deception is not exactly a moral high ground. But doesn't it say as much about a society that so arbitrarily values parenthood as to give one a motive for such deception? Indeed there is one scene in the movie that seems to give such value to being a parent that non-parents might as well bow out of the mating game in disgrace. With such attudes, no wonder some would cheat and deceive! Again, this is a somewhat amusing comedy that can be fun to watch. Just avoid buying into the overhyped premise that it rises to the level of a morality play!",1032652800,8,2897,4.715976331360947
7939097,5,B00005JL7Q,"Great movie. Funny, and with a message about the importance of family. Only one eyebrow raising brief sexual scene (no skin). There is also one scary scene of a character getting sick. Some cussing. We waited till the kids were fifteen to watch with them just because of some heavy themes here. But it is one of our all time favorites and one of those movies that we make a big deal of watching with our kids.",1525824000,,409,4.324675324675325

Good cast and I'd watch again.  My only criticism is towards the end.  Spoiler alert...

When the boy (Marcus) was going to sing at his school for his mother, how come she was at a single parents meeting where Hugh Grant unexpectedly picked her up and brought her to the school?  She had wanted to be there.  So why wasn't she there on her own?  Did I miss something?",1522368000,,562,4.245283018867925
