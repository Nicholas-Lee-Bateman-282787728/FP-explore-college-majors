8483616,5,B005QR35OA,"Dick Powell hits it big as ""Johnny O'Clock"", a secret Film Noir to be mentioned with his other killer Noir Pitfall. As you may expect, it's a story of Murder and Betrayal with the leading man in the noose for the crime! Not unlike Double Indemnity, the dialog alone is worthy of critical acclaim. Evelyn Keyes is solid as usual; but if you haven't seen her please see The Prowler (1951). Back to Johnny, he's got it all. Hell, he doesn't even have to get up and go to work in the mornings. He has a right hand man that wakes him up every evening to man the casino floor. Johnny O'Clock is the real deal, but he's also in serious trouble if the cops don't get it straight about a suicide-turned-murder rapp!! He's in a tough racket and can't trust anyone. This film is a worthwhile Film Noir to be seen ASAP!!!

8483617,2,B005QR35OA,"I reduced my rating from 5 stars to 2 because of the poor quality of the DVD.  This was obviously Videotaped from the Mystery Chanel, because their logo shows up during the film.  It appears as if someone taped it and then transferred it to DVD.  This is a 5 star film, but a 2 star copy.  Buyer beware. This disc is extremely hard to watch and it's a shame because this is such a great film.  Dick Powell made his conversion from song and dance man into Film Noir in ""Murder, My Sweet.""  He continues to play an excellent tough guy in ""Johnny O'Clock.""  Powell as Johnny O'Clock, is a partner in a night club with a mobster who is in cahoots with a dirty cop.  O'Clock helps to investigate the murder of the hat-check girl from the club.  The girl was in love with the dirty cop and O'Clock suspects him of the murder.  The dead girl's sister comes to town to identify her sister and becomes the love interest for O'Clock.  The story has many twists and turns as one would expect in Film Noir.  If you are a fan of the genre, the ""Johnny O'Clock"" is a must have for your collection., but wait until they offer a cleaner version of the film.",1372550400,2,1141,4.207373271889401
8483618,1,B005QR35OA,"This review is for the disc/transfer, not the movie.  The movie is good.  The disc is beyond wretched.  It looks like a drunken sailor (no offense to drunken sailors who probably would have done a better job) was holding a camera in front of a TV - you can even see the Mystery TV logo in the lower right corner sometimes.  The frame shoots up, it slides down, it drifts right, it drifts left.  If you love pan and scan this presentation is your dream.

And it's blurry to boot.

I've bought DVD -R movies before and they've been fine.  But this is horrendous!

If you will die, literally, without a ""Johnny O'Clock"" fix and can't wait until a better version comes out, if ever, then go ahead and buy this.  But this is an abomination and I don't see how Amazon can sell it.  It's worse than some public domain movies I've bought on eBay.

Amazon says ""This film may contain variations in audio and video quality due to limitations of the original source material."" No s***!

On the other hand, it is good to get a movie that's rare.  But they should have warned us more clearly and also done a better job on the transfer - it's not that hard.

I wasted my money - when there were no reviews of this here - so you won't have to waste yours.  And if you do buy this you deserve to throw your money down the drain.

And don't forget to take a Dramamine before watching it and have a bucket standing by.",1358380800,10,1400,4.222641509433962
8483619,4,B005QR35OA,"I watched this many times growing up (in the 1950s) and enjoyed (and still) both
the story line and the acting of Dick Powell. He's even better in the earlier
Murder My Sweet which is based on Raymond Chandler's Farewell My Lovely,but
that is mainly due to the better script. Johnny O'Clock definitely needs
 to be available on DVD at a reasonable price.",1348012800,13,354,4.619047619047619
