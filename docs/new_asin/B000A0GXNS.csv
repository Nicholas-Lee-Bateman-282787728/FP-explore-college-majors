2345542,5,B000A0GXNS,"After reading the reviews, I was concerned that this might be a bit too scary for my 4 year old daughter, so I watched it online first and decided it was okay for her to see.  She LOVED this movie and asks to watch it over and over again.  The brief vision of Hell was not too scary, only lasted a few seconds, and I watched the movie with her and explained it to her.  I also explained that the man who was threatening to ""boil the children in oil"" was only trying to scare them into telling him what he wanted to hear.  The overall message and story is so good, and the movie is a great way to introduce children to the miracle at Fatima and to Marian apparitions in general.  I'm very happy I got this movie and plan to get more movies from this company (we also have Juan Diego: Messenger of Guadalupe and Patrick: Brave Shepherd of the Emerald Isle, which she also really enjoys).  Great story of the faith of the little saints and of the love they had for Jesus and the Blessed Virgin Mary, which I would recommend to anyone.  This is a ""kids' movie"" but I enjoy it a lot too!!!",1436227200,,1084,4.133333333333334

2345546,5,B000A0GXNS,Wonderful old animated film on the story of Our Lady of Fatima.,1411516800,,63,4.333333333333333
2345547,5,B000A0GXNS,"In a half hour, this movie covers the reality of Fatima better than many feature-length, live action tellings I have seen (e.g., _The Thirteenth Day_).  Every time I watch a Fatima movie, I think, ""Are they going to mention the 'many rosaries' thing?""  ""Are they going to show Hell?""  ""Are they going to show Our Lady of Mt. Carmel?""
I am laughing at the two negative reviews: 1) how is it brainwashing to show historical events that were witnessed by tens of thousands of people, including atheists?  2) how is it inappropriate for children?
My kids have seen things far scarier and more violent, starting with just about any other historical cartoon, like _Liberty's Kids_.",1406419200,,675,4.843478260869565
2345548,5,B000A0GXNS,"Was recommended by my husband- he watched it growing up.  Leaves a great impression on my children about how our behavior and telling the truth does have an impact- sometimes good, sometimes bad, but that God does see and care.",1399248000,,227,4.675
2345599,5,B000A0GXNS,"A must see for all children, and most adults.
 Praise the Lord Jesus Christ now and forever!

God bless.",1396656000,,115,4.428571428571429
2345600,5,B000A0GXNS,"The movie itself is good (really good for children to learn about what The Blessed Virgin is asking the world), but since this is such a rare DVD to find, make sure you get it new. I bought a used one and found out it was a copy burned onto a blank DVD, though the cover looked pretty authentic. I was refunded my money, but that's not the point. Either get it new or ask the seller for proof it's an authentic copy.

As for the movie, it's a simple story of a very intense subject: reparation for sins of the world - conversion of sinners. The Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to three simple children and through Her message to them, speaks to us. The vision of Hell may be scary, but the reality of Hell is worse.....and we have the opportunity to help people not go there. And it took the removal of the sun from its orbit to demonstrate how important The Message is.

DVDs like this are rare and precious. Make sure you get an authentic one.",1387324800,5,942,4.227777777777778
2345601,5,B000A0GXNS,My grandkids and their friends love this video which tells the story of the appearance of our Lady of Fatima very well and tastefully.  I recommend it for children of all ages.,1379548800,,176,4.5
2345602,5,B000A0GXNS,"i have watched this movie since i was a child. now, i play this for my kids. they ask for it all the time. ages; 5,3,and 2. i think it is great for teaching compassion, sacrifice, and prayer. it is a great way to initiate conversation about angels, Jesus, Mary, and hell. as i grew older i became more interested in these saints lives and our mother's message. it was thanks to this movie that plant the seed.",1349654400,5,409,4.256410256410256
2345603,5,B000A0GXNS,"I had to write this review after hearing another reviewer say it was too scary. Followed by someone claiming they could never feel God's love/trust Him because of martyrs like this. I must say the point is being missed entirely. God saved these children from their opressors. Every day Christians are persecuted for their faith, it is a reality. This shows children that God is their protector. Even your family can say hurtful mean things and people in power can threaten you, but God saves. Not a bad message for children to hear.

We watch this on the Feast of Fatima, but my children like this and other ccc DVDs and request it often. My husband and I weren't raised Catholic and it's a nice way for us to learn along with them. The animation is sweet and a movie adults won't mid watching as well. As far as nightmares, my youngest has watched it and never had a nightmare. None of my kids have been scared. In fact, they comment on the meanness of the police man and the parents. And talk about a ""black heart"" and how love and Jesus make your heart red again. And those people need to love Jesus so their hearts won't be black. That's what should be taken out of this DVD. And if my four and five year olds get that, it's sad that adults don't get such a simple message.",1323820800,5,1277,4.343096234309623
2345604,5,B000A0GXNS,"I watched this a lot when I was younger. I grew up in a strong Catholic Portuguese family. I absolutely LOVE this film! It has great motives and meanings for children. The Children of this generation should follow in the footsteps of these little 3 saints. Lucia, Jacinta & Francisco. I'm sure your children will love this film and ask to watch it over an over again! God Bless!",1294444800,7,378,4.492753623188406
2345605,5,B000A0GXNS,I purchased this for my daughter's class to have popcorn and movie when celebrating the Our Lady of Fatima at her school.  Not only was it a different take on a classroom party but it was educational and told the story in the way 1st graders can learn.  Perfect animated movie.,1275609600,4,277,4.411764705882353
2345606,1,B000A0GXNS,"This adaptation opens with children frolicking in the bucolic countryside of Portugal. It seems innocent enough, but beware. After the apparition of Mary occurs, the tone of the piece soon becomes evil and sinister. The parents of the children are dark and threatening, berating them and denouncing them for embarrassing the family. It gets worse! The children are hauled to municipal court, where they are threatened by dark and twisted officials that if they do not recant, they will be boiled alive in oil. As another reviewer mentioned, there is also a vision of hell that will give little ones nightmares. Is this wholesome family entertainment? I think not! The story could have been presented in a much more age appropriate way!",1267660800,5,735,5.032786885245901
2345607,3,B000A0GXNS,"This product came to us as stated with no problems from the seller.
It is not something that I care to watch but my wife liked it and is using it to brainwash my two young grandchildren into believing in god.",1265155200,,208,4.097560975609756
2345608,5,B000A0GXNS,"""The Day the Sun Danced"" is an excellent introduction to the apparitions at Fatima, which occurred to three children in Portugal in 1913. Lucia and her cousins, Francisco and Jacinta, are out herding their families' sheep when an angel appears to them. This vision is followed a few days later by an appearance of the Virgin Mary. Despite pressure from their parents and the local authorities to stop going to the cova (where they are seeing the apparitions), the children will not recant and continue to go. On October 13 of that year, the ""Miracle of the Sun"" took place in front of thousands of spectators.
The movie is well done and nicely animated. The vision of Hell that is shown in the film (and that the children experienced) may be a very frightening for very young children.",1242172800,12,785,4.695652173913044
