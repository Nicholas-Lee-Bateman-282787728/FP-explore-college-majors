5367498,1,B009TE9GZI,"Season 7 was excellent. The cliff hanger that was left for viewers completely had me wanting more. I hated the year long wait into what I later learned to be the Final season of Season 8. The first 2 or 3 episodes were good. Revealing who the person was who shot Nancy was a little illogical and that trigger was pulled too early. WAY too early. I think the final season would have been better had that story line been stretched out longer. Anyway, after the resolution of Nancy's failed assassination, it all went down hill from there. The rest of the episodes fell flat, and just felt like filler episodes. The Andy-Jill story was pretty humorous to me as an upside. The series finale was seriously an awful dreadful hour of TV. Was excruciating to watch, I couldn't stop because as a long time fan, I would enjoy closure. Doug and his estranged son pretty much made that episode. It bothered me greatly that they skipped so many years for the final episode. It felt like extremely lazy writing and they didn't have anymore creative juices left. I could have written a better final season than this. All in all, this was a horrible season. The only way I recommend buying this season is if you're a longtime Weeds fan and you're trying to complete your collection or what have you. I was so saddened that this was how they chose to produce this as the final season. Explains the all time low ratings for the show. Although I do hope Mary-Louise Parker finds work on a new tv show with Showtime or HBO, because she was amazing with Weeds. Goodbye Weeds. You will be missed.",1355356800,19,1574,4.487804878048781
5367499,5,B009TE9GZI,"For reasons that I don't understand, fans of the long-running Showtime series ""Weeds"" are divided, when it comes to the final season. I gave Season Seven of Weeds 5 stars, because I didn't want to admit that the quality had dipped drastically. If S7 were the last, I truly would have been upset. In season eight, Jenji Kohan and crew know from the beginning that it's the last season. It started out as a show primarily about family. So we get more moments with our core characters. We aren't introduced to any new cartoonish bad guys - drug dealers or gangsters. We learn to love the characters that we used to love again.

And as a longtime fan who has been here since the beginning, I think it's the best way they could have ended things. For the first time in years, we get genuine character development, most of the characters redeem themselves, and we're left with a quiet and nuanced series finale that reminded me that there is some hope in the cynical world of ""Weeds"".

The start of season eight shows our favorite antiheroine Nancy Botwin recovering from a possibly fatal shot to the head. Not one member of her family sheds a tear, and we're reminded how cynical and broken they are. We have yet another new location - fictitious Connecticut suburb Old Sandwich. It's a lot like Agrestic. It's interesting that the show had this big multi-location journey over eight years, to ultimately end up where they began.

After a three-month recovery, Nancy vows to be a better person, after finally realizing that she's been a pretty terrible person. Stevie is back in her life, and she's trying to allow him as much of a normal life as possible. She gets out of the drug game (at least for a while), and gets a legit job, where she is still around drugs, ironically. Silas is still growing and selling pot, while Shane is preparing to be a cop in the NYPD, allowing for a new interesting dynamic between the two. Jill and her daughters have moved in with the family, and Jill almost automatically restarts her sordid romance with Andy. Even a character as despicable as Jill ultimately becomes likable in the end.

The show's characters are grappling with real issues this season. Nancy, who still has a bullet lodged in her head, is wondering why she was given a second chance. She befriends a rabbi who spoke with Andy when Nancy was coma-ridden in the hospital. Andy's also wondering what the point of his life is. They're realizing that death is closer, and they contemplate religion pretty heavily, which is interesting, since religion had always been something to point and laugh at on this show. While events aren't necessarily as exciting as previous seasons may have been, we see all of the Botwins moving forward in their own lives, as they slowly drift apart from one another, into more permanent jobs and lives.

While I don't want to give away too much, there are many other high points of this season. The landmark 100th episode is a return to Agrestic (now called Regrestic), where many old characters are revisited, and old wounds are opened again, and the relationship and unsaid dynamic between Andy and Nancy is finally resolved.

The series finale feels very much like a reunion show, set many years in the future, where many old characters from both Agrestic and Ren Mar show up. The hour-long finale is quiet and nuanced, and not big and exciting like one would think. We see where each character is, and it's interesting to see. The ending is something that satisfied me. It isn't a happily-ever-after ending, but it's not terribly sad either. For someone who has followed this show for years, I couldn't have wanted a better ending. I thought it was beautiful, emotional and redemptive. I'm truly going to miss this show.  Forever live the Botwins.",1352419200,108,3778,4.706505295007564
5367500,3,B009TE9GZI,"After my first TV series I followed began to decline in quality for its second season (Desperate Housewives) Weeds came along and for it's first 7 seasons it was a rare gem; the foul-mouthed weed selling family, the Botwin's adventures went through comical murder, arson, deadly betrayal and steamy sex.

The first two episodes ""Messy"" & ""A Beam of Sunshine"" provided hope that this would be a stellar send off for the Botwin clan. Although sadly, the quality quickly drops. You would think that with Jill, her daughters, Doug, Silas, Shane, Stevie and Nancy would have endless family drama, instead we got a very quiet season with virtually no twists and turns which without, Weeds lost its buzz fast.

I'll try to withhold spoilers for those who haven't gotten the early release of this season; the plot in this season fizzles out fast, and is re-lit for the 100th episode, ""God Willing and the Creek Don't Rise"" with lots of familiar faces from the Agrestic (now Regrestic) seasons.

The series finale ended on a very flat note. It was quiet, it was odd, and trying to be spoiler free it switched things up for a poor ending that left a bad taste in my mouth. After 8 seasons of shoot outs, gangsters, cartels, trafficking, and organized crime we are treated to a rather tame finale that really doesn't resolve too many unanswered plot lines.

Over all, I'm saddened that this season failed to deliver. Seasons 1-7 are great and are worthy of being some of the best TV in a while, but the 8th season turned out to be the weak link in the chain.",1351123200,21,1547,4.614545454545454

5367526,5,B009TE9GZI,"This is the first time I've watched the show through streaming since it originally aired and I enjoyed it even more the second time through. Jenji Kohan brought together a brilliant mix of writers, actors and crew for this production. If you've missed out on this jewel, it's time to pounce. Whether you're a binge watcher or someone looking for a new show to add to a limited weekly video time allotment, Weeds is perfect. More on the comedy side of a dramady, it's 28 minutes an episode with  a continuous highly addictive storyline.  You'll want to cheer on this dysfunctional family led by the luckiest or unluckiest widowed mother of two, Nancy Botwin, as she reels head long into one misadventure after another in her high heels sipping her iced coffees at first dodging the PTA, then the DEA. You guys don't need a summary from me just this: it appealed to my dry and even dark sense of humor at times. It's original smart and hilarious! At times it will tug on your heart strings. Just watch and enjoy. I'm supposed to be reviewing season 8. Well, as far as final seasons and series finales go, it was done very well. I wasn't disappointed.  And after awhile has passed and I miss them, I will revisit the Botwins and friends and watch it all over again!",1477612800,,1262,4.526315789473684

5367634,1,B009TE9GZI,"The overall series is a fantastic watch. However, it's like the final two seasons were written by a completely different team of authors - here's why I think so.

Season 6 actually does a much better job at wrapping it up. Season 7 and 8 really feel tucked on and I really hate that, because there was so much potential.

A few things that went wrong:
- Three years have passed between season 6 and season 7-8. The actors obviously just aged one year and the ages thus don't match. Shane is about 19 years old in season 8, but the actor is 17 (1994) and even looks young for his age. This is a botch in season 7's story, but it obviously persists, because there was no way to fix it.
- Season 8 has no real story twists. There also seems to be a total lack of hairy situations.
- The main characters often don't stick together. Instead of teaming up and helping each other, each character lives in his or her own bubble. Even though they're mostly in the same place, the characters are far apart from each other mentally and the problems they're dealing with aren't threats, but mostly personal stuff. The story is very fragmented, like a myriad of mini stories stitched together. Most times it feels like waiting for the interesting story to continue.
- Characters feel miserable all the time. They're constantly in a gloomy mood. Instead of action and interesting situations you're presented with the characters sulking around and having an identity crisis. Especially Andy's character is just a shadow of what've come to expect from him. In the previous seasons he was good at solving other character's problems with his cool, interesting and often unorthodox, inventive and cunning methods. Him whining around about his life just doesn't feel like Andy and it's a pain to watch - especially when Nancy and Silis do the same.
- From screen time alone Doug is a main character in season 8, but his story is totally uninteresting. They should have slipped him into the background like they did with Celia or let him just tack along like they did with Doug in season 6.
- And finally: What the hell happened to Shane's story? At the end of season 6, he's on a plane with Andy, Doug and his brother, Silis, journeying into a foreign country with a bag stuffed to the brim with dollar bills. After what he did at the end of season 5, you'd think he'd be a bit cold hearted, emotionally unstable or at least a bit aggressive under the surface. Instead he ends up being the most calm and sane of them all. Good for him, but it makes his story in season 7 and 8 super lame.",1406419200,,2568,4.473347547974414

5367651,3,B009TE9GZI,"Hill Street Blues was perhaps the first TV show to take humorous situations
and shift on a dime to a dire or tragic situation or conversely take a tragic/dire
situations and shift to humor. Always unpredictable in an age of TV predictability.
The first few seasons of Weeds had that style of unpredictability combined with
great writing/characters and great acting--Nancy was the sexiest babe on the
box. Season 4-5 saw the show starting to slip, no more whip-saw emotional shifts
and in their place linear story-lines that lacked danger, humor or irony. Season
7 was an embarrassment, how could the writing become so mundane and
if not totally predictable just not very interesting?  I bought season 8 on the
strength of the other reviews here on Amazon--all I can figure is that anyone
that gave this POS season 5*s had simply forgotten how stellar the first few seasons
were, perhaps they were so anesthetized by the last few crappy seasons that
the nostalgia of bringing back earlier characters/scenery woke them from their
aesthetic torpor. The only irony in this last season is that it introduced new
possibilities that could have been used earlier to salvage the fallow seasons.
Doug's new ""religion"" combined with Andy's Judaism etc.,
the actors for the last few seasons seem to have been ""phoning it in"".
Nancy's character seemed listless, Andy's parts seemed tired and his ""stoner rants""
just seemed like empty posturing eliciting pity where there once had been belly laughs.
3 1/2 stars is the best I can rate this. I'm glad ""Weeds"" is finally out of it's misery. I'm
going to light the bong and watch House Of Cards to get this final season off my mind.",1395187200,,1665,4.862676056338028

THEY COULD HAVE MADE IT BETTER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1392422400,,365,3.88
5367656,3,B009TE9GZI,"I've been following Weeds since around season 4 (I haven't seen the first three seasons) so while I know a little about life back in Agrestic, my understanding of the characters started later than most viewers. Having said that, I really liked the blend of drama and dark humour and to me, it's a fantastically unique show with some really amazing acting.

[Contains some spoilers below]

Season 8 does unfold slowly when compared with the gripping and fast-paced season 7 and the characters, while still entertaining and compelling, aren't as funny as they used to be. I remember laughing a lot less this season than previous ones and it seems that the creative energy is slowly drying up as we move through the first two or three episodes. Unfortunately for me, I never really liked Nancy's sister as a character, so her more prominent place in Seasons 7 and 8 left me feeling a little frustrated but she does, in the end, become more tolerable and perhaps even slightly likable.

Into episodes 4 and 5, the season picks up a little bit and things get more light-hearted but there's always that sense that the end is near and the writers are stuck for where to take the characters. Probably the highlight of the season is episode 11 when Nancy, Andy and Silas return to Agrestic (now Regrestic) in an attempt to re-hash old business opportunities and rekindle old sparks. The sad news is that everything in the episode feels rushed and stale so while dragging it out would have been a very bad idea indeed, more interesting dialogue between the characters would have made this episode shine brighter.

Then comes the season finale (in the form of a one hour double-episode) where we take a leap into the future to see where the characters have ended up. I can see why they chose to wrap up the series as a whole rather than just the season as it stands. I thought that doing a whole hour-long episode devoted to the future of the Botwins and their various friends and allies was a brilliant way to end the series. The writing for this episode (as expected) was obviously the best it can be as Weeds creator Jenji Kohan, by tradition, leads out the season. My problem doesn't stem from the acting, the story or the lack of quality writing - it stems from disappointment in exactly where the characters end up. I won't say much but I will say that it isn't the ending I would have written for Nancy. I still felt sympathetic towards her after all these years and I would have liked things to have ended a little more happily for her. The strange conundrum here is that while I'm not thrilled with the way things turned out, I appreciate that what happens as a result of the way things have turned out is absolutely realistic and that's probably the best way to handle characters which seem very real to most of us.

As others have said and I will echo, I will miss the Botwins very much so. The series was truly one of the best out there and was a little piece of genius in my book even if the last season wasn't its best. I am always disappointed somehow with season finales because I never feel like the writers do a good job of handling the nostalgia, the sadness and the progress of a final episode. I must say though that as a whole, the final episode of Weeds is well-written and handled as it should have been apart from the slight disappointment I spoke about earlier.

Anyone who is a fan of the series should of course get the final season: to complete your collection, to revel in nostalgia and to pay respect to the show itself, the writers, the actors, crew and all those involved. It was a bit of a mediocre season overall but we needed closure for these characters and that is exactly what we get in the eighth and final season of Weeds.",1391904000,3,3752,4.486090775988287

but overall the show had a great story and a show that seemed it needed to be done and it was done. and we all know it could have been much much worse
and the other issue i have is the weed amounts and prices. like in one seen a woman hands the protagonist a ""pound of weed"" which was the size of a ounce and visa versa, hell if you don't even know anything about weed or the size and look of it you can see different scenes of pot deals where in one hand Mrs. Botwin buys less than a pound gets a bigger bag than the pound bag they had before.

But, after later trying the series, first on Netflix, then later for the last season on Amazon, we had to play it a second time to see what we missed. Yes, it's crude, rude, salacious and gross all at once but at the same time it's hilarious, warm, poignant, and heart warming. If you can get past the language and the occasional violence, you will really go on a trip watching all nine seasons. I wish there were another nine!",1379980800,,497,4.297872340425532

Do I think she would have been happier had she never sold pot? I really don't know. People strive to be the best at what they do, so they can have the things they want.

It was satisfying as scratching an itch can be satisfying, but it wasn't memorable. Granted, I didn't watch all 8 seasons and I wasn't so hooked that I just craved each episode even if I knew they'd only make me stupid and hungry.

The one thing I found interesting is the commentary about where we might be headed-- toward legal smokes and Starbuck-like franchising of pot. The brief glimpses into the lives of the characters years down the road wasn't nearly as thought-provoking.",1377561600,,622,4.603603603603603

It seemed to me that the writers ran out of ideas and didn't really know what to do with the characters. Nancy dating the rabbi had a great deal of potential but again, it didn't really go anywhere and Doug's storyline was a total waste of time. I did like that Andy's character seemed to grow and mature a bit! I hated the final episode. Taking a show into the future has been done over and over again by other tv series and it is just so boring and unoriginal!  Weeds deserved a better send off than what they got!

Frankly, If you're reading this review, it's because you've probably seen the earlier ones and you have reach closure just to see if Nancy gets Worst Mom Ever award.  You won't start with Season 8, but it does tie up lots of loose ends.",1364515200,,464,4.488095238095238

Season 7 is totally boring, unfunny, unoriginal, and I could barely force myself to finish it. But Season 8 is just downright bad. Nothing funny, everyone unlikeable, especially Nancy. Andy is checked out and you'll want to as well. Several storylines go nowhere and just peter out. The strongest seasons by far are 2 - 5 -- they are fantastic. Skip all the others.",1363478400,2,496,4.847058823529411

After I got charged a shipping charge and a restock charge I didn't even get half of my money back so be WARNED, don't return DVDs as you won't get what you paid for them.  I am also out the money for the Blu Ray, had there been an option to swap them out for an even exchange that is what I would have done.  What is really sad is the price at the time for the Blu Ray and the standard DVD were both $19.99, usually the Blu Ray is more money but since this was a pre-order I got a good deal on it.  I must say I am very disappointed, so I got an $8 credit for a $19.99 DVD, someone sure made money on that deal plus I had to purchase the Blu Ray.

5367821,5,B009TE9GZI,This is the final season for a great series.  Have been of fan of Weeds from the beginning and this is the capstone.  It ties up lots of loose ends.,1363305600,,148,3.9
5367822,3,B009TE9GZI,"First of all I will say it was a blast seeing all the old favs of Nancy, Andy, Shane, Silas, and Doug again as well as all the recurring supporting characters!!  I also loved seeing some old favorites again such as Conrad and Guillermo.  Those characters were just so very well written from the beginning of the series, and it was like seeing old family members again.
  That being said......I have to ask Jenji ( the creator and chief writer of the show) what the heck was she thinking????  I thought the characters acted very out of character for the way they were written in the past six seasons.  Characteristics that were established very early in the show and even some in just the last few years were totally denied or rewritten completely!!!!!  For example the character of Nancy who had been established as being a danger junky who couldn't hold down a regular job (such as when she was operator of the undercover baby store), and who could not live a normal life, gave it all up to run a ""legal"" weed business in a future where weed is legal (as if that's going to happen in a short seven years!!).
  Another example was of her son Shane, who from the very start was shown to have a brilliant mind but to have anti social and budding sociopathic tendencies.  The boy who bit a foot....who gave a graduation speech about how their parents messed up their generation......who hit Dan in the face with a tray in high school just so he wouldn't get picked on....and who killed a woman to protect his family (and was unashamed and proud of it mentioning it whenever he could).....became a petty corrupt cop....an alcoholic....who was bitter and unsuccessful in life and was ashamed of himself and was full of loathing and self hatred.  ""Thwack!....Splash!....Dead!""  Jenji you sure did drop the ball there!!
  All in all, I would recommend this for anyone who wants to complete their collection, and who wants to see the journey to its bitter end.  Otherwise I would say to you to just skip this one and to get the first six blue ray season of weeds and enjoy!!",1363219200,,2066,4.560975609756097

5367824,5,B009TE9GZI,"This final installment of Weeds takes viewers full circle, but has a few bumps along the way. Nancy and her gang get wrapped up in more hijinks, mayhem and unexpected (or expected) situations. Although, I didn't expect ""who got smoked"" to indeed get smoked, so that was good written twist.

5367842,5,B009TE9GZI,I rarely find a series that entertains me enough to stick with it for longer than a season or two.  Weeds was certainly the exception.  I simply couldn't wait to see what Nancy was going to get herself into next.  At the end of Season 7 I was REALLY hoping we'd get a season 8.  Season 8 provided closure to me for the characters.  I particularly liked the last two episodes.  It brought the series around full circle with the 5 mainstays of the show.  I liked that they advanced time as forward as they did for the very end.  Will be looking for more work from these folks!,1362355200,6,574,4.201834862385321

5367845,4,B009TE9GZI,So I have loved this whole series.  I do have to say the final season fell short of the rest of the series which left you at the edge of your seat with what is going to happen next but I guess this is the nature of having to tie up the lose ends and end the show - if you were wondering what came next it is not really closure for the show.  That said - I enjoyed every minute of the final season and will miss this series.,1362268800,,423,3.688888888888889

5367851,5,B009TE9GZI,"I have mixed feelings about this show.  Doug, for example, makes me cringe in a bad way.  Some of the humor is so stupid its painful to watch.  On the other hand, most of the characters are engaging and feel so oddly genuine.  I thought the first season was the best of them all, I liked Halia and Conrad.

As far as finales go, I gotta say, they did it right.  It was satisfying to see what happens ""in the end"".  Thanks for caring enough about your audience to think about if from the audience point of view.  Are all rabbis like Dave?  I am thinking about converting.",1362009600,,570,4.203703703703703

5367853,1,B009TE9GZI,"Weeds seasons 1 - 5 are all fantastic. 6 is when it started to go downhill, 7 is total dullsville and season 8 is downright bad. It's boring, completely unfunny, and several scenes featuring Doug (played by Kevin Nealon) are so crude and humorless that they're hard to watch. What happened to the hilarious, original, zany writing and the tight editing that propelled the storylines at just the right pace? That is all gone is season 8. The side stories are unnecessary and never go anywhere and Nancy is so unlikable that you don't care if she lives or dies. We used to understand why she had the power she did over the men in her life - because she was charming and smart and mesmerizing. In season 8, she's just awful - the charm and sweetness and humor are gone. The light has gone out. The actors seem aware of just how uninteresting the show has gotten - they seem strangely disengaged. Even Andy seems bored by being in the show, and he used to be the best thing about it. A really sad way to end what was once one of the best shows on tv.",1362009600,5,1046,4.287878787878788

5367856,1,B009TE9GZI,"Once one of my favorite shows, I think what they put as a final season could of been maybe 2-3 episodes. It starts out with Nancy recovering from being shot then quickly spirals out of control. All the plot lines were laborously dragged out. The most interesting chracter introduced is Rabbi Dave but then his story is glossed over and he's killed off. The last two episodes is some undefined future where, widowed again and ageless, Nancy runs a legal retail pot empire, Doug is the leader of a clut (totally stupid), Andy has moved back to CA, Silas is married to
deaf Megan w/ baby, Stevie is 13 and about to be bar-mitzvahed, and Shane is a cop and dealing with stress and crazy friends by drinking and shooting cakes.
None of the characters seem to have an ephifany or change except maybe Silas. There's a totally forced scene between Nancy and Andy on the second to last episode where they finally and publically have sex. It's just really bad.
I think that the show would of done better if they would of ended it 2 seasons ago. The last 2 seasons are bad, bad, bad writing taking the characters nowhere. I hung in there hoping the brilliance this show once had would return but sadly it doesn't.",1361836800,3,1202,4.493150684931507

5367858,5,B009TE9GZI,I just finished watching this season; I watched all the other seasons to right after I ordered this season and it really was helpful. I think this is one show you should start with the first season and work your way through to the end. With that said this had to be my favorite season yet. The humor is wonderful and the actors are the best. Its funny you look at the Botwins and they look like a family. I've grown to love this family. This season once again it is full of surprises. I'm not going to say much and spoil the fun for you. I'm amazed that they could pull this show off on TV but they did and it worked. I loved how they brought back the old theme song and got people caught up with the history of the show. They took a lot of bold chances with this to keep it fresh and once again it worked out nicely. What can I say but I love this show and am thankful that I have the dvds so I can watch it again and again. By the way I have watched all of the seasons multiple times and have picked up a number of different things each time. A one of a kind show and it such a great job on the ending they didn't blow it.,1361577600,13,1124,3.8701298701298703
5367859,5,B009TE9GZI,"This last season wound everything up nicely.  It brought everything home and showed that every life has value, even the most unconventional.  I have to admit that I liked how it ended for Nancy, taking her out of control, putting the focus on her sons and the other men in her life who stuck by her for so long.  Now they can all go on out into cyberspace, living their separate lives and I'm okay that it's over.  Very well done final season.",1361577600,,443,4.301204819277109

5367861,5,B009TE9GZI,This was a quirky start to the end of the series. Its interesting to see how the characters have grown and changed... or maybe not so much. The show was getting over the top and so far it looks like the final season is going to stick to that aesthetic,1361577600,,251,4.04

5367867,1,B009TE9GZI,"As good as this series WAS...... Season 8 was, to put it mildly, a sham. The writer obviously ran out of creativity, and really should have tied a bow on it a season sooner. The scripts were SO  shallow. Regardless, Mary Louise Parker carried it as far as it could go, and was superb throughout. I guess all series, like 24, In Plain Sight and The Sopranos can't end leaving us wanting more. Life is timing, and Weeds shouldn't have been on life support throughout Season 8.

Loved the entire series all the way through up through Season 5 and then we kept hoping things would improve - we hung in there to the end but the writers really failed us...,1361145600,,254,4.183673469387755
5367870,2,B009TE9GZI,"I loved Weeds from the very first season for its complexity of character.  Each individual was complicated in their own way as they struggled to cope with whatever life threw at them.  They learned and grew amid the turmoil just as normal people do except there was nothing normal about their life situation at all.

But the thing I regret most about the whole thing is that the characters regressed so badly as the seasons went on.  Initially they were flawed people like all of us, but they were likeable.  At least they tried to do the right thing most of the time.  But by the time we get to season 8 the veil is off, and the characters like Doug are not even remotely likeable and their behavior is simply irredeemable and reprehensible.  They are irresponsible and they don't even pretend to care how they harm their children or those around them with their antics.

Nope, I am glad this series is over.  I want to remember the characters the way they were early on and avoid further damage to the brand by dragging out this nonsense drama any further.  It simply got stale in the end, and the characters lost their way.  So sad to see such genius reduced to such lazy, sloppy work at the end.  This series did not run off into the sunset, it loped off into nothingness....Meh is all I can say about season 8.",1361145600,5,1315,4.410788381742739

S8 does try out a few new things, but being retrospective gets a bit dull, I did find myself losing interest at times throughout S8. Some good moments, but as it the season advanced, I found it hard to believe the characters and what I saw was acting.

8544219,1,B009TE9GZI,"I watched this on Netflix and I tried to forge through it. But, honestly, the main character sucks. She is a selfish, uncaring character. She uses and treats her brother in law like cheap. She dominates her kids, making them her little puppets. She lies to her kids about very important things, then cries the victim when confronted. She dresses super sleazy for a upper middle aged woman. She can't act. I was surprised she was nominated for any awards. She treated her brother in law with no respect and expected him to always be there and cater to her. I don't understand why any man would be attracted to her. She treats her friends horribly. She uses everyone she comes in contact with. I had really hoped she would change as a person, but that never happened. The brother in law and oldest son were the best actors. I found myself hoping and wishing bad things would happen to her. At the end, a few people distanced themselves from her, which was good and best for them. She was a horrible person. I didn't think there were any comical parts. The acting was horrible, especially the main character. I'm really sad that I wasted all that time watching this show and hating her and her character so intensely. I'm sad that I hoped through every episode, bad things would happen to her. Good mother's put their kids first, not themselves. She was a horrible mother, sister in law, friend and actress. I had really 'high' hopes for this show that I was even willing to overlook the main characters horrible acting...very disappointed.",1529107200,,1537,4.633699633699634
