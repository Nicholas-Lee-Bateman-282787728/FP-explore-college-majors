8689208,5,1929499019,I have used both of these videos in personal work and with spiritual practice groups I lead. I've found each of the videos to be a valuable resource for introducing basic Core Energetic exercises and a helpful support in practicing them ongoingly. The exercises definitely work to increase energy and a sense of aliveness. Pam Chubbuck's instructions are easy to understand and follow. I  recommend this video series to anyone seeking to embrace life more fully.,983664000,,462,5.078947368421052
