8560905,3,B00B1LM77G,"BBC did my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/very-favorite/dp/B002VXEC26/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">very favorite</a>&nbsp;among all the Alice films I've seen to date. They could have stopped there - and, based on what I see here, should have.

The blue-screen opticals seem dated by today's standards, and appear so often I found them distracting. Character costumes, though more elaborate than in other Alices, often came across as stiff, and the characters' motions and choreography often seemed too silly to let me suspend disbelief.

This isn't the worst Alice I've seen the worst are really bad. I just find this dated and bland, compared to the good ones out there. Don't run if you see this one coming, but don't go out of your way for it, either.

8560907,5,B00B1LM77G,"I really enjoyed this version of Alice in Wonderland. It followed the actual story almost perfectly, unlike most versions. The costuming was really quite beautiful. The whole miniseries was done in almost a story book appearance. Through the entire show, the background appears to be done with a green screen, which the story book looking background was later added. I personally liked the look of it, because it gave you the feeling of being inside the story. I not only recommend this version to collectors like myself, but I also recommend it to anyone who would like to experience Alice in Wonderland, other than the well known Disney version.",1395360000,8,647,4.944954128440367
8560908,5,B00B1LM77G,This was a gift to my daughter as she loves all things that are connected to Alice In Wonderland.  She's slowly collecting everything she can of the various movies.,1379721600,,164,4.655172413793103
8560909,5,B00B1LM77G,Alice was a gift. It was shipped very quickly. It was new and clean. I would order again. I was very happy with my order. Thank You,1376092800,,131,3.888888888888889
8560910,3,B00B1LM77G,"Shipping was fast and movie was in great condition. Just not what I thought the movie would be. And it's not the seller's fault obviously. I was hoping for more especially from BBC productions, but with so many Alice versions out there, you can't like them all I guess.",1372118400,3,269,4.510204081632653
8560911,5,B00B1LM77G,Another Alice movie . When will they stick to the book and not try to make it something worth seeing . Would you change Dickens plays ? Another actor saying the same lines but each time another person does it it is nice to be able to compare productions,1371686400,,253,4.183673469387755
8560912,5,B00B1LM77G,"When I first saw this movie I thought it was made in 2013 it is not, it was made in 1986 but put on dvd in 2013, being filmed in 1986 it does have that stage look that most movies produced by the BBC had in the 80's (think ""Chronicles of Narnia).This dvd is a musical and despite being blue on the cover Alice's dress and headband are pink.

I am planning on getting the sequel""Through the looking glass""",1364774400,8,404,4.113924050632911
