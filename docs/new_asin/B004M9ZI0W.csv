4429233,4,B004M9ZI0W,"At our house we LOVE the Curious George TV series. I really wish they would put out the DVDs as seasons instead of in this format, but that's another story.

All of these episodes are great. The only reason I give 4 stars is that Charkie Goes to School is a repeat, already appearing on the Back to School DVD. Why they felt the need to put it on this one I don't understand. Here's a list of the episodes you are getting on this disc... George's Home Run; A Monkey's Duckling; Well Done, George; Curious George Personal Trainer; Charkie Goes to School; Out of Order; Monkey Underground; Juicy George.

I know you'll enjoy if you love George!",1319673600,16,642,4.432203389830509
