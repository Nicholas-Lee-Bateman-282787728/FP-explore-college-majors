5966303,5,B00F3L8ON6,I love classic Cartoons and this is one of the good ones and it had some of the best animation for an 80's series and the plot were great compared to the ones today.,1388707200,,165,3.8823529411764706
5966304,5,B00F3L8ON6,"Back in the 80's, I used to rush home from school just to watch this series on Channel 13. I was 'Totally to the max"" excited when it was released on DVD.",1388620800,3,154,3.84375
5966305,5,B00F3L8ON6,"Watched Beverly Hills Teens as a kid. So glad the series was finally released on DVD! The 3 DVDs come stacked on top of each other in the case, I personally didn't like that, but the discs had no scratches, etc. so no harm done. Would have loved to see some behind the scenes interviews with cast and crew. Otherwise, great picture and sound quality. Very happy with this release and purchase, worth the wait!",1386720000,,409,4.466666666666667
5966306,5,B00F3L8ON6,"FINALLY the remaining episodes are now on DVD to complete the collection follow up from volume one!! 33 more great episodes on 3 discs including ""Roughing it"" Bianca's Dream"" The slumber party"" A splitting image"" Diet please"" And ""Miracle at the teen club pt 1&2"".Loved this show so much in the 80's brings back fond memories!",1386633600,,326,4.839285714285714
5966307,5,B00F3L8ON6,"Oh the late 1980's - what a time. That cartoon is just as adorable as I remember watching on my sister's VHS tapes. I still want JUST For KIDS to release ""Maxie's World"" hopefully soon - my 80's cartoon collection is getting close to completion. The quality on the DVD's aren't bad at all. The new packaging - with the 3 DVD's stacked on top are different. Still not a scratch and plays just perfectly.",1383350400,3,402,4.373333333333333
5966308,4,B00F3L8ON6,"Prior to Cookie Jar's recent DVD releases of this somewhat obscure 1987 animated series, I never knew just how many episodes existed! Like Volume One, this second set contains plenty more colorful stories portraying the outrageous adventures and shenanigans of characters such as the manipulative Bianca, the egocentric Pierce, the sweet do-gooder Shanelle, All-American girl Larke, boy genius Chester McTech, and many others!

Keep in mind while watching this collection that all of the episodes in this series were produced and aired within a very short time. That's why it's easy to overlook a few shortcomings on some of the later episodes (slightly repetitive plots, occasional shortcuts in the animation). Overall, Beverly Hills Teens stands out for its sheer escapism. Viewers of all ages will likely find something to relate to in at least one of the characters. And yes, Bianca's (often failed) schemes are a real highlight!

A great value. If you're a casual fan of '80s cartoons, Volume 1 will most likely suffice. But if you're a diehard cartoon fan who appreciates total suspension of disbelief, Volume 2 of Beverly Hills Teens will also be a most welcome addition to your collection!",1382486400,3,1197,5.164948453608248

5966315,2,B00F3L8ON6,"I was expecting this DVD to have secondary spanish audio, but it doesn't even have subtitles. It was a gift for my sister, since we used to watch this show together when we were little in our home country, and I wanted her to bring back old memories, however it's hard to do that when it only has english audio, it's like a whole new show for us. Too bad it doesn't specify that in the description.",1409097600,,398,4.181818181818182

Also back are Switchboard, Nikki and Bianca's goofball chauffeur Wilshire (all of whom I forgot to mention in my review of the previous set).  This set has lots of fun episodes includin' ""Diet Please"", ""Hold the Anchovies"" and ""That Winning Smile"".  So whether if you're new to this show or not, ya should still check it out.  Also, this series also has a great soundtrack from the legendary Haim Saban and Shuki Levy as well.  The theme song's great too!
