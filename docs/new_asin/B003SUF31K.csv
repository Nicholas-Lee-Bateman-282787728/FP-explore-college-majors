4189728,5,B003SUF31K,A wonderful documentary about the Aurora Monster Models of our youth.  Very informative and a Must for all monster kids.,1296172800,,120,5.0
4189729,4,B003SUF31K,"I've been waiting for someone to do a DVD on the ol' Aurora Monster Model kits for a long time, and this one didn't disappoint! I really enjoyed it.",1283212800,,148,4.137931034482759
4189730,5,B003SUF31K,"Great job on this one, if you are a fan of the old Aurora monster model kits, this is a must-have.",1282867200,,98,3.7142857142857144
4189731,5,B003SUF31K,Not that familiar with Zacherly and Gorgo since I'm on the west coast so I forwarded thru those segments but the history and the interviews were well worth the price.,1281744000,4,166,4.566666666666666
4189732,5,B003SUF31K,"A real great dvd with interesting stories from and about the people that made Aurora model kits famous, all presented by Zacherley The Cool Ghoul. Wow, real cool!",1381104000,,162,4.821428571428571
4189733,5,B003SUF31K,"For any kid growing up in the late 19060s and early 1970s, the Aurora models were a must have.  This DVD brings back so many memories.  I highly recommend it to all nostalgia buffs and model makers and collectors.  Great!",1368057600,,221,4.475
4189734,5,B003SUF31K,"This is intended for those who built models as a kid and watched the creature feature or horror movies on saturday afernoons.  Zacherly is in it as well,",1366675200,,153,4.464285714285714
4189735,4,B003SUF31K,"A must see for any ""Monster Kid"" who grew up in the sixties and read Famous Monsters of Filmland and constructed these
models.  A slick professional production.  My only disappointment was that, in the editing process, they did not linger on shots
of the constructed models.  As is popular today, cutting is rapidfire and constantly changing to match current viewer's diminished attention spans.  A very well done and informative documentary.  I simply would have liked to see the models themselves on the screen longer.",1359849600,2,520,5.142857142857143
4189736,4,B003SUF31K,"The glue holding this thing together is a rather corny bit of fluff with Zacherley and a dragon muppet,  but the insiders info on the origins of the Aurora monster kits,  with the design teams who produced them, and the fans who enjoyed them is very cool.
For a kid from the late sixties to mid seventies this is a great trip down memory lane.  Just open up a tube of glue for the sensory boost and toss this disc in ;)",1356912000,,419,4.085365853658536
4189737,5,B003SUF31K,"This is a MUST HAVE for anybody who used to build the Aurora line of monster models when they were kids back in the sixties as well as those of us who never stopped. Zacherly, The Cool Ghoul, is a bit older and cheesier now (if you look carefully when he answers the phone you can see how arthritis has gnarled his fingers), but I still love him (he is the only known TV host of horror, SciFi, and schlock, who actually inherited the position from his dad, the original Zacherly). There are wonderful interviews with some of the people involved with Aurora (artists, sculptors, distributors, etc.) during the time of their greatest achievements. You simply cannot find some of this info anywhere else. Highly recommended for the Aurora obsessed!",1356566400,,745,4.7384615384615385
4189738,5,B003SUF31K,"For anyone who grew up buying and owning these awesome model kits, fans of cool retro toys, and those who were weaned on Famous Monsters Of Filmland and vintage horror, this DVD is a must-have. Absolutely AMAZING interviews, previously-unknown info (and I mean A LOT of info, all eye-dazzingly illustrated), breath-taking looks at the iconic artwork (and the changes inflicted on it over the years), an introduction to the artists who brought them to vivid life, the scandalous reaction to one series in particular, and many drool-inducing glimpses at projects that were planned, but, alas, were never to be. Amazing, amazing, amazing! I had my jaw on the floor several times watching this. I would reiteerate that ONLY purchases made directly from The Witch's Dungeon (either directly or through Amazon) will help recoup the cost of making this documentary, and help fund more amazing projects they have in mind. It costs a coupla bucks more from Witch's Dungeon but it's totally worth it to support those who truly love, support, and sustain these beloved monsters. Long live Cortlandt Hull, Bill Diamond, The Witch's Dungeon, and those iconic AURORA MONSTERS!!!",1355270400,,1164,5.164021164021164
4189739,5,B003SUF31K,"Excellent behind-the-logo look at the soul of what makes Aurora kits some of the best ever offered by anyone, and the people that made it happen.",1354838400,,145,4.615384615384615
4189740,4,B003SUF31K,"A fantastic tribute to the old monster kits. Produced by the Witch's Dungeon. Remember, the only way to benefit the Witch's Dungeon Museum is to purchase the DVD from  the Witch's Dungeon directly.",1352160000,,197,4.96969696969697
4189741,5,B003SUF31K,"Oh what memories I have of building these sinister model kits. Aurora was the first company to take a chance on monster themed model kits as it was thought that they wouldn't sell well...... a silly notion that was soon realized as the monster model craze took the world by storm. This DVD is a loving tribute of those kits that filled every ""Monster Kid's"" shelf in their room back in the 60's. They have released them several times over the years and the on screen interviews with many artist and fans brings back many great horror fun memories.

The program runs almost two full hours with many built-up kits on screen and many familiar stories and some not so familiar. If I had one criticism, it would be they should have done 360 views of the built up kits so we could get a look at them. Don't get me wrong, they show most of your favorites, but for a documentary called 'The Aurora Monsters' it would have been a welcomed addition to see all of the kits close up and at many angles.

The DVD is released by a non profit organization (Witches Dungeon) which has a museum dedicated to the famous monsters and the actors who helped bring them to life. If you're a monster kid, buy a copy of this for entertainment and to help preserve the monster kid in all of us!",1298937600,10,1269,4.350210970464135

8404733,5,B003SUF31K,I read on a Facebook page that they were rereleasing this DVD and I was so excited.  I missed the original release and it had been sold out for a few years now.

8404735,4,B003SUF31K,"Even though this is more of an amateur film, there is enough fun and nostalgia, not to mention some cool stories and a ton of photos to bring a smile to one's face. Thanks for the wonderful trip back in time!",1494374400,,208,4.097560975609756
