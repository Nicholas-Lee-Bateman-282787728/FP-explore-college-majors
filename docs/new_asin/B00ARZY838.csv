8557339,4,B00ARZY838,"So you get all three ""Demonic Toys"" flicks; all 3 ""Gingerdead Man"" movies (by the way-all 6 are on one highly compressed disc); and a second disc of the three ""Killjoy"" movies in one neat little package. Is it high art? Uh.... NO. But it is a fun Charles Band sampler and even if you ignore the Killjoy flicks (which I personally loathe), you still get 6 movies that are low budget fun. And for way under ten bucks Gary Busey & Tim Thomerson? You could do worse dive in and enjoy)!

...and for you videophiles... all are wide screen but have no extras.",1372723200,,552,4.3076923076923075
