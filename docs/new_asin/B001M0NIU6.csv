3692026,1,B001M0NIU6,I found this video to be to simplistic & devoid of content that would be beneficial to young black girls. Girls experience puberty at an earlier age now & this film skipped that as well as some other pertinent issues that should have been addressed. I wasted my money on this video in this tough econony only because I thought it would be beneficial for my niece.,1243209600,3,363,4.432835820895522
3692027,5,B001M0NIU6,"This documentary deals with issues that exist because of stereotypical, racial profiling of young Black girls when they are at their most vulnerable, (Puberty).

The journey takes you from self esteem issues due to skin color, features and hair texture....all isms that come out of American whites defining Black Beauty.  We watch young girls talk about self hate because of some stereotypes.....but this documentary puts the issues on the table and through conversation with famous Black women who had to deal with isms...these young girls come to realize that they are unique and Black Beauty must only be defined by Black people. This documentary is a wake-up call for all young girls who read fashion mags and watch TV. It helps you understand why weave wearing, light complexion, made up images are not necessarily beautiful.  Kinky hair, dark skin, bold features...are all beautiful....love the you that you are.....",1241827200,24,922,5.216216216216216
3692028,5,B001M0NIU6,I thought this documentary was informative and very thought provoking.  If you have any contact with girls of any age you should watch this.,1232236800,10,140,4.833333333333333

8320256,5,B001M0NIU6,"Watched this excellent documentary with my daughters and they (and I) thought the subject matter of the media's almost one-dimensional portrayal (mostly negative) of black females was both factual and thought provoking.

Contributions from well known actors like Regina King, Jada Pinkett-Smith, musician/activist Chuck D and others were compelling.

It would be great if the same treatment could be given to a documentary on the media portrayal of black men which I believe does require comment.",1405468800,,496,5.5131578947368425
8320257,4,B001M0NIU6,"Revealed attitudes I long knew existed. Bought for educational purposes. Would recommend for those in guardianship of young females and males, and maybe for all persuasions, not only black children/young people.",1387843200,,211,5.838709677419355
8320258,5,B001M0NIU6,The dvd was a great one. Thanks for being a professional at your trade. Please keep up the good work. It is needed in times like these.,1382140800,,135,4.037037037037037
8320259,3,B001M0NIU6,"The content was okay, but the quality of the video and sound wasn't very good.  I hate that I have to type a review when I've given a rating and title and NOW there's a word limit to add to my annoyance.",1375056000,,203,3.8333333333333335
8320260,3,B001M0NIU6,"I'm a father of two young black girls, and the topic of this documentary is near and dear to my heart. That's the only reason I suffered through the overbearing narrative of this documentary's director. The subjects that she interviews for the documentary are never allowed to speak for themselves. They're given perhaps 30 seconds before the director's monotone, redundant and vapid commentary is inserted between what seems to be about a hundred segues. This is truly tragic, because the short snippets that we're allowed to hear from the voices that SHOULD be featured in this documentary are profound, insightful and moving. I wish my daughters could hear from the people that were interviewed rather than the director. It's as if the director was afraid of being upstaged. It left me feeling like there was almost some kind of conspiracy to make sure the truth that was being spoken on camera would never be allowed to be heard undiluted. Ordinarily, I would give anything so ham-handed a one and wish there was an option for zero, but the topic is so important, that the film is still worth consideration. Maybe someday someone will liberate the amazing footage that was shot for the documentary and allow it to be seen unedited. One can only hope.",1331164800,40,1254,4.864485981308412
8320261,5,B001M0NIU6,"This film was purchased after watching Bill Duke's Dark Girl's.  This film talks about the full gamut of issues of colorism. From RB/Hip Hop Videos, to magazines. Production wise, it could have been better, but it gets the point across that we have to embrace our beauty as blacks.  Dark Girl's won't get released until another 6 months... so I would start with this film. IT MUST BE SHOWN TO OUR YOUNG CHILDREN AND YOUNG MEN...BLACK OR WHITE AND IN BETWEEN!",1327708800,3,458,4.6419753086419755
8320262,4,B001M0NIU6,"This documentary was designed to SPARK conversation not provide answers. It was to help you shine light on a topic that is NOT discussed. Even young men need to see this because they are not understanding how they are treating or playing into the stereotypes. The part with the White Women discussing Black Women was really great. With all this mess happening with Nicki Minja and Lil Kim, when you look at and hear Kelly Rowland's music/videos, it tells us that we are not having conversations with our BLACK GIRLS! Buy the Video an start a movement. I am a man with NO KIDS and I am doing my part!",1310688000,11,599,4.454545454545454
8320263,2,B001M0NIU6,"I THINK I WAS EXPECTING A MOVIE, NOT WHAT I VIEW AS MORE OF A DOCUMENTARY. VERY DISAPPOINTED, AND FEEL AS THOUGH IT WAS A WASTE OF MONEY.",1302220800,,137,3.9285714285714284
8320264,5,B001M0NIU6,"I learned a lot watching this film. Even if you only know black women in passing, this is a must have.",1265068800,8,102,3.9047619047619047
