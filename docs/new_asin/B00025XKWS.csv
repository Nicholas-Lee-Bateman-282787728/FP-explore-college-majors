8022522,4,B00025XKWS,"Love to watch old movies to see actors when they were young. Mickey Rooney couldn't be much younger or he wouldn't be there. Typical story about boxing, betting, and doing the right thing. Film is very grainy looking but easy to watch.  I'm afraid the actors weren't very effective in the fight scenes but the story was well told. If you like to study old films and perhaps see some actors you are not so familiar with, this pic should satisfy you. Period clothes and cars are great.",1518307200,,483,4.488636363636363

The movie begins in an arena for a boxing match. The fix is in but they will put on a show. The two boxers are introduced then begin the fight. One boxer scores a knockout! He picks up easy dough. ""Flash"" has plans for this boxer. Later he does road work. ""Breaking the Sabbath!"" This boxer will go to church. [Note a young Mickey Rooney.] The minister preaches his sermon. One car is pushed home. A gong has a reaction for ""Tugboat"". Two weeks later Francis has a date for dinner. Can they build up a boxer in order to profit in the future? A $1,000 bet! There's a law against parking on a highway without lights. The promoter calls a woman for a job, right now. There is an argument with ""Flash"" over Mary Wilson. ""Knockout"" Morgan wins again! Its part of a build-up.

""Flash"" gives order to Frankie. Mary's little brother Arthur has a big knife for whittling. Mary attends the calves. [Watch the one on the right.] ""Where's Frankie?"" ""Flash"" has a story for Mary. This trick worked. [A failure to communicate or trust?] But Frankie sees Mary again. ""Flash"" makes a deal, Frankie will take a dive in the fourth round. Arthur hears too much, so he goes missing. ""Calling all cars!"" Frankie and Mary hear two men talk about Arthur and rescue him. ""Is it true?"" Frankie explains the fight game. Mary wants an honest match. What will Frankie do? ""Flash"" bet against him. Sportswriters use their typewriters beside the ring. There is a real fight now. Saved by the bell. Frankie continues but is knocked down. Then the champ is down! A new welterweight champion! Frankie makes an announcement on the radio. Mary shows up for a happy ending.

But you wonder what will happen to ""Flash"" if he can't pay his gambling debts. What sort of future will Frankie have in a small town? Will his father-in-law find him a job? Later films about boxing have similar stories. You would think all these movies would warn people against betting on fights. Does advertising and news coverage work to promote betting? ""Never bet on a sport where the animals can talk"" said a famous gambler. This gives a view of small town life (as seen by Hollywood).",1341014400,2,2157,4.554123711340206

THE BIG CHANCE is a programmer from Poverty Row's Eagle Productions that starred John Darrow as pugilist 'Knockout' Frankie (Rocky) Morgan. Darrow (real name Harry Simpson) had a relatively brief motion picture career (1924-36). He appeared in mostly forgettable 'B' grade works (like this one), retired and became a talent agent.

Despite its somewhat mediocre and predictable plot, ""Big Chance"" does have an interesting early-thirties feel and features young up-and-comer Mickey Rooney as brother of the boxer's sweety. But don't expect much from the fight scenes-- they're a blend of unconvincing actors and stock footage.

Transfer quality isn't the best, as source material looks degraded-- probably a 16mm print used for early TV broadcasts.

SYNOPSIS--
Boxer Frankie Morgan ignores the advice of trainer Flash McQuaid (Betz) and cuts a deal with a crime boss who arranges for Frankie to win ""fixed"" fights and become a betting favorite. His scheduled title bout will be a losing effort however. Young Arthur Wilson (Rooney) creates major problems when he overhears Frankie and the mobster arguing about the fix plot.
