7022573,1,B00TUKLMS0,"I would give zero stars if possible. The singing and music volumes were off. The singing was kind of weird. It was about as soothing and fun as the German team from Pitch Perfect trying to sing to babies. Also, the pictures children on the  case was misleading, it's looped animation. My 10 month old was not interested at all.",1470700800,,327,4.45
