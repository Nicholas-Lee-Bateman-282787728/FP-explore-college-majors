8285068,1,B001BXNA84,"I wish the DVD producers would get organized and list the episodes by the date they originally aired, the secret word for each episode, and the names of the first two guests, on both the DVD covers and on Amazon and other sales web sites, so collectors of ""YOU BET YOUR LIFE"" episodes can figure out which ones they have, and which ones they still need to buy,

Far too many 'YOU BET YOUR LIFE"" DVDs are just re-hashes of the same episodes that have appeared on other DVDs, and VHS tapes, repackaged with different artwork and names for the covers, some leaving out some episodes to cash in on the interest in ""YOU BET YOUR LIFE"" episodes by splitting them into multiple volumes from larger compilations.

Several hundred episodes were filmed and aired over a period of almost 14 years, and so it's frustrating to find the same relatively few episodes cropping up again and again on almost every DVD compilation.

From the fragmented descriptions from other reviewers of this volume, it sounds like this is another one of those re-hash collections, and thus isn't worth the effort to buy.

Until it's re-released with the above-mentioned specifics about all the episodes contained in it, this gets only one star in my book.
