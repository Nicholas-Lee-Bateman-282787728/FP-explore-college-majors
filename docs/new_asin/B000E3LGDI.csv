2486978,4,B000E3LGDI,"It's about time that these were issued.  It seems a tremendous effort went into producing this set, combining the English audio elements to the best visual elements and resynchronizing them, rather than merely taking the video that may have accompanied the English audio copies.  THIS is why the Japanese versions can't be included, as one reviewer here wishes.  They have different editing and running times.  Personally, I'd much rather have these versions that I grew up with....let's leave the Japanese versions for another day and another set.

My only complaint is that the processing of the audio seems to have sucked some of the life out of the sound......it has all the sonic earmarks of over application of digital noise reduction.  Too bad, it makes for a muted quality, and sucks some of the life out of the viewing experience.",1145750400,8,839,4.957142857142857
2486979,5,B000E3LGDI,"The newest DVD release of the original US verison of the 1960's Astro Boy is indeed ""Rocket High"" and has been long anticipated by many, especially the original fans. Considering that the original film masters were almost destroyed years ago ( in some cases several of the original Japenese versions were destroyed) it is a miracle that these benchmark masterpieces of early Japanese animation still survive at all. Even though the original English version sound masters were destroyed, the collected sound files used are overall, very good especially considering these were produced 43 years ago. Perhaps sound and imaging technologies will soon compensate for the aforementioned. Old and new fans alike shall certainly be saying . . . Go, go, go Astro Boy!",1144454400,16,758,5.170731707317073
2486980,4,B000E3LGDI,"The show itself is very well made, considering the time that it was made, in Japan, and the story of ""Tetsusawan Atom"" or ""Astro Boy"" is very captivating, but the dubbing for US television is absolutely pitifuly. Of course, this was the 50's and they were trying to make the lines match the plot AND lip movement exactly, which resulted in the characters speaking very fast, or very slow. And it comes of as just plain silly. Of course, it has a nice 50's feeling to it, so it's good for nostalgia. I would prefer to watch this show as it was meant to be seen... in japanese, with english subtitles. Unfortunately, only TWO episodes are availble in Japanese with english subtitles. If they can do that with 2 episodes, they could do it with all of them. That's why I can't give this set 5 stars, despite how much I love Astro Boy and Osamu Tezuka's work",1144368000,9,853,4.405063291139241
2486981,5,B000E3LGDI,"Largely unseen for over 30 years, most current audiences only know Astro Boy by its reputation and through various remakes. While contemporary anime may have greater technical polish, there's energy, imagination and a surprising amount of humor to these shows which is still unmatched. The sad news is the english masters and negatives were destroyed ages ago. The good news is thanks to fans and collectors worldwide the first 52 episodes are all accounted for with video from the Japanese masters married to english audio from a variety of sources. In a few cases the sound may leave something to be desired, but that should only make us all the more thankful for a piece of TV history which was very nearly lost to us for all time. This beautifully packaged set of 11 single sided discs displays very handsomely. Extras include an interview with Fred Ladd and two episodes of Tetsuwan Atomu in Japanese with english subtitles (Episode #1 & 20) to allow comparison with its original version.

2486985,5,B000E3LGDI,"to reduce confusion of Astro Boy DVD series, please note that there have been 3 series so far:  the Black and White 1963 series, the 1980 First Color version, and the 2003 Color version with different stories.

The black and white 1963 version has 193 episodes.

The 1980 version has 52 episodes for the Japanese version, with the first and second episodes merged and cut into 1 episode as the US version.  The birth of the character Atlas is removed in the US version.  As a result, the US version only has 51 episodes.

The 2003 version has 50 episodes.  This version once again has one more episode in the Japanese version.  The US version has 1 episode less, which is replaced by a ""clip show episode"". (probably meaning frame by frame).  Personally, I think the 1980 version is slightly cuter than the 2003 version.  The 2003 version is more lavish.

This is a beautifully packaged and presented DVD set, which has obviously been put together with great care. The episodes are fantastic, and it is interesting to see how the story lines were morphed in the creation of later series.

Sure it's ""only"" in black and white, and the sound on some of the episodes leaves something to be desired, but these cartoons have something a lot of todays animated shows for kids lack and that's HEART!  I had also forgotton the surprising amount of adult themes in some of the stories. The role of technology, human-robot relations, and whether robots are really "" alive "". A lot of ideas that would much later be developed to a greater degree, of course, in movies like "" Blade Runner "".  And characters actually die on occasion.  Plus there are plenty of cool robots, monsters, aliens and gangsters that look like they stepped out of an old Warner Brothers movie!  And to top it off, the upbeat Astro Boy theme music.

2486989,5,B000E3LGDI,"Hello Astro Boy fans!

I was about 7 years old when this series first aired on television.  Being raised in a middle class family, in 1963, we had only one television.  Everything was in black and white and there were only 7 channels on the VHF air waves. Cable didn't exist and the internet was the subject for magazines like ""Popular Science"" or comic books: It simply didn't exist. Color had not really come out yet and when it did come out, you had to be very rich to afford a color TV. The channels our black and white set could recieve were 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11 & 13.  Channel 2 was CBS; Channel 4 was NBC; Channel 5 was KTLA; Channel 7 was ABC; Channel 9 was KHJ; Channel 11 was KTTV and Channel 13 was KCOP.

That was it back then.  We didn't have desk top computers or any of the high tech gadgets young people take for granted these days. Most of these technological changes came after 1981.

The best anyone personally had, in the way of a calculating device, was either an abacus or a slide rule back in those days. (lol)  I remember sharing this with a group of friends in my mid twenties, while sitting next to me was a beautiful, 10 year old boy, who looked up at me, with Astro Boy eyes, asking ""What's a slide rule?"".  Boy it sure made me feel old, after a quarter of a century of living, being asked the question.  I guess you can tell when you are getting older, once you start to use the words; ""Do you remember when"".  I do that allot at 50 years of age these days. (chuckling)

The really big computers; I did get to see as a boy.  Those units took up an entire building with their vacuum tube/transitors.  Next to how things look today, you might say we looked rather backwards in those days next to today's technology; but it was a magical time to be alive in regardless. You can watch the movie ""Destination Moon"" and get a pretty good idea how rheostats, dials and gauges looked back when I was a boy. In fact I use to take apart old abandoned radios that had been thrown away near some old railroad tracks where we use to live, just to salvage their old parts to help me learn how they worked: This was before Radio Shack offered kits to teach young boys, like me, how such things worked. In fact, back in those times; Heathkit was the name if you wanted to buy do it yourself components while teaching yourself electronics.

From 1981 on; I watched as our whole society started to change into the world of Astro Boy!  Even the planning being done for cars, that will run themselves without drivers in the not so distant future, is well in the works these days, just as Osamu Tezuka forsaw back in his day.  I suspect someday soon, the real Tobio will be born to ride in one of those cars; given the direction technology is taking mankind.  I also can see the day when artificial intelligence will be more real than anyone ever imagined, providing mankind doesn't destroy itself getting there.

The original 1963 Astro Boy, not only taught us great values growing up, concerning righteousness and kindness toward each other, but it paved the way showing us what our future might look like and it appears Osamu Tezuka hit allot of things right on the mark since then.  The laws that make up the human heart, of course, never changes: Those are timeless and Osuma did a grand job covering the variables of good vs evil; not to mention the preciousness of human life in his work.

These anime's are nothing but uplifting to watch.  You go to bed having nothing but good dreams when you watch this old series.  These days; there is little on TV, let alone in the theatre's, that leaves you with this kind of feeling; with so much being darkness in all our movies these days.  In fact, when my cousin recently took me to a nearby DVD store, all I could see with the covers of all the DVD's, that lined the shelves, was artwork that was always dark and foreboding.  At my age, you see things allot more clearly than the young do and boy I could hardly wait to get out of that store.  Very little was uplifting on the shelves or worth buying in my view.  For the most part, I keep my buying assigned to the internet these days, while being careful what to chose to add to my library and I love shopping on Amazon because of its review section.

I carefully select what is to go in my library and for something to be considered, it must have a good story line that teaches a good moral or gives a profound revelation about human nature. It must also have good character development as well. I don't mind the clash beteen good and evil; but I do love a happy ending.  Cecil B. Demil was right when he said; ""You can show all the evil you want on the silver screen, but make sure good wins out over evil or your audience will hate you.""

I don't know of any film, which has broken that rule, that has survived in anyone's memory.  Even the Harry Potter films operate from a simple premise of good vs evil and very successfully I might add.  The premise Jo Rawlings is using is very simple:  Dumbledore is God; Voldermort is the Devil; Hermoine, Ron and Harry are the soul; (the mind, the heart and the will) with Hogworts being their spiritual realm of operation or the Universe.  Gene Roddenberry knew the same formula with Star Trek.  Spock, McCoy and Kirk are the soul; (the mind, the heart and the will) travelling in a body; (the star ship Enterprise) suspended between the good and evil of the Universe or Spiritual realm of God.

In short, you can't get away from the good and evil aspects of free will in God's Universe, but if the good was not always winning out, then the Universe, it seems to me, would have destoyed itself a long time ago, especially this world.  Our kids need this message of hope and the old Astro Boy series brings that home.

While the 1983 and 2004 remakes are different from the 1963 original; those works should not be compared to the 1963 original, although I do see the 1983 remake followed allot of the original 1963 story lines. In fact, I think the 1983 remake was a little more ""cutesy"", than the 1963 formulation; but I still enjoyed it.  1983 and 2004 were different times and those works are great in their own right.  I especially loved the 2004 remake.  Very intense and more together in terms of the major story behind Astro; which is the natural world vs. the synthetic world our science has unleashed, since the first A-Bomb was dropped and how the two clash looking for coexistence.  How it all turns out, it seems only Astro knows in the end.

While the 1975 master reels were destroyed, I think the folks who did all they could to round up master copies, while syncing up the sound, did a great job; all things considered.  Only about three episodes have sound quality that sounds like the recording was recorded in a glass jar, but otherwise the rest of the audio is just great.  Looks almost new for the most part.

The design work on the box is just fine: Very tight package.  Even the booklet that comes with the set gives a good history behind the whole Astro Boy phenomenon.  The lithographic printing is excellent for both box cover and booklet I might add.  There is even an extra disk which includes the first of a two part interview with Fred Ladd, who tells a little more of how Astro Boy made it to the United States from its original Japanese audience and boy am I sure glad it did.  It sure helped my childhood along.  My thanks to the late Osamu Tezaka for his gift to all us kids and his vision of what could be a great future one day.

All in all, it's all worth the price of admission. This is gret for the whole family.  Delivery was on time.  No complaints! Thanks Amazon for making this available to my generation again.  I should think kids of today would enjoy the old series, like we did as kids; that is when they are not too busy being blown away by the 2004 remake of Astro.

2486991,5,B000E3LGDI,"I watched Astro Boy as a child in the 1960s. Having it on DVD is a dream come true. Right Stuf went to great lengths to find the best surviving duplicate masters they could, splicing in video from the original Japanese masters as necessary to restore the shows. Astro Boy now looks better than ever. The audio is surprisingly good on most of the episodes, however there are a small handful of episodes that sound poor. It's a small issue compared to the value of having this piece of history restored to us. The English dub, featuring Billie Lou Watt as Astro Boy, Ray Owens as Dr. Elefun, and Gilbert Mack as Mr. Pompous is a joy to listen to. It still sounds fresh and lively more than 40 years later.

This set is a lot of fun and if you are interested is well worth looking into. I am looking forward to the second set and I hope they find a way to release the Japanese Versions that were never made into American Versions. I would also be interested in those. If you haven't seen them, the original Astroboy comics are also worth looking into. The 1963 series does not do a bad job of catching the look and feel of the comics.

8105441,4,B000E3LGDI,"Though there was Japanese animation long before Astro Boy, this is the show that truly sparked the explosion of what we know today as Anime.  Unfortunately, the original Astro Boy has largely been unavailable for viewing by Americans since it vanished from television a generation and more ago.  Now, since this was the show that got me hooked on Japanese Anime (though I had no idea that's what it was when I first watched it on TV), I had always dreamed of seeing it again someday because with a handful of exception episodes, I hadn't seen it in more than half a century.  However, for various reasons, including fear of disappointment from revisiting a childhood favorite, I had not bothered to do so until a special sale finally tempted me.  Turns out I needn't have worried; Osamu Tezuka's genius really does stand the test of time!

Though the animation is quite limited, one can already see so many of the anime tropes we have gotten used to, particularly those anime eyes, but the quality that shines through the strongest is the writing.  These are some astonishingly complex ideas and plots for a children's show in 1963!  It runs the gamut from the downright disturbing origin story: ""Birth of Astro Boy"" (created by a truly mad scientists in the image of his dead son, when Astro Boy fails to grow, he is rejected by the man he calls father and sold to a circus) to the creepiest Christmas episode ever: ""Snow Lion"" (Earth is blanketed by a mysterious, living snow that drains energy from all machinery).  In between are a number of gems like ""Expedition to Mars"" (the episode that sold the series to Fred Ladd involves Astro Boy being put in command over a mutinous robot hating human officer), ""Silver Comet"" (Astro Boy helps protect a boy racer from sabotage and attack during a round the world auto race that must have been part of the inspiration for ""Speed Racer""), ""The Spirit Machine"" (a parody of Nazi Germany involving robots leading a doomed resistance movement and a serious debate over whether it is acceptable to build weapons for world conquest even under threat of death), ""The Cosmic Giant"" (was a giant robot from outer space too powerful for even Astro Boy to defeat so he he had to trick him into leaving the planet, but that leaves him able to come back... next season), and the tragic two parter: ""Cleopatra's Heart"" and ""Return of Cleopatra"" (evil scientist builds an all too realistic robot of Cleopatra in order to revive the Egyptian empire, but finds her increasingly unwilling to cooperate with his selfish and deadly plans).  It is well known that Tezuka used interactions between humans and robots as metaphors for commenting on prejudices, but it may not be as well known that he demanded the same from robots as he did from humans.  Sentient robots were expected to know the difference between right and wrong, and failure to do so could and did result in termination with extreme prejudice at the hands of a sorrowful but determined Astro Boy.

Note: Did you ever wonder how Tetsuwan Atomu became Astro Boy?  Fred Ladd explains in an interview on the Extras Disk.  To begin with, one of Fred Ladd's favorite classic stories from childhood is Pinocchio, and it just so happens that Dr. Osamu Tezuka's Tetsuwan Atomu was also inspired by Pinocchio.  Well, in the Disney version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pinocchio/dp/B00838HSYM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pinocchio</a>, he gets swallowed by a giant whale named Monstro, and around the same time as the anime version of Tetsuwan Atomu was coming out, Fred Ladd was working on a futuristic sequel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pinocchio-in-Outer-Space/dp/B00008H2H6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pinocchio in Outer Space</a>&nbsp;in which he gets swallowed by a monstrous space whale named Astro.  The Boy part of the name came from American teenage comic book superheroes of the time: Superboy, etc..

So why only four stars?  Because the creators of this restored version made an astonishingly shortsighted, penny wise but pound foolish mistake that will greatly hinder many viewers' enjoyment of this show--they failed to include optional subtitles.  While the video is in surprisingly good shape, the audio is in noticeably poor shape because the original English masters were destroyed in 1975.  Of course this is not the fault of Nozomi Entertainment and Right Stuf!, and I'm sure they did their best to locate the highest quality audio masters they could find, but IMHO they should have gone the extra mile to offer subtitles of the American version as an option because there are several places in a number of the poorest quality episodes where it is all but impossible to hear exactly what is being said (or sung), and there is no way that producing English subtitles of the English dialog could have added that much to the cost of set that retailed for a hundred and thirty.",1461369600,,5284,5.275327771156138

The packaging itself consists of a 2-piece heavy cardboard box containing 5 individual, standard plastic DVD cases (each holding 2 DVDs), and one slim DVD case holding the extras DVD. The artwork on the box is excellent, as is that on the DVD cases & discs themselves.

Included in the box is a nice booklet with a biography of Osamu Tezuka, the series creator, and a description of his works as well as an episode guide.

For all you anime & manga fans out there, the quality of Osamu Tezuka is the guy that basically the father of anime & manga. The quality of his artwork & stories is what kicked off Japan's love of anime & manga back in the 50's.

I remember as a boy in the early 70's watching these episodes on KDNL-30, our UHF station in St. Louis, MO.

What strikes me about the early Astro Boy is the uniqueness of the individual characters. Also, very little use of what I call the 'big-eyes' so over-used in modern anime & manga. Also of note are the humorous little 'bites' Tezuka puts in each cartoon like a mouse roasting a weenie underneath a rocket blasting off, or Astro Boy 'fencing' against a female robot and changing her hair-style with each swipe of his 'rapier'. Such great, funny details to look out for.

I highly recommend this series to any anime fan, especially those who are interested in the way the masters did it 'back in the day'. Can't wait to get set 2!!!",1318291200,,1560,4.362068965517241
