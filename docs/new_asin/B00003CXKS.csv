1278027,4,B00003CXKS,"I am a huge fan of Bjork's and when I heard about this movie, I originally just wanted to see it because of her. Now that I've seen it, I know it is a masterpiece all in it's own. The beauty of Bjork's songs that really capture how Selma feels draws you closer into the film. I just have one complaint... the camera work is a bit jumpy and if you get motion sickness be wary. Also, this is not Bjork's feature film debut as some say. She was also in the movie ""The Juniper Tree"". But besides that, everyone should this movie as it is a work of magic.",971222400,2,550,4.009090909090909
1278028,5,B00003CXKS,"Lars von Trier's masterpiece is nothing less than brilliant, as it begins with a provocative ink blot, and a rising overture produced by the movie's star Bjork, that maps out the vicissitudes of the next two hours.  Von Trier's hand-held digital camera rumbles through Selma's(Bjork) drab world - as she is suffering from a degenerative eye disease - and treats the audience to close-ups and zoom shots of the disgruntled or jovial Bjork, a la Bergman.  Von Trier's unstable camera is the trade mark of his Dogma 95 movement, which stresses austerity and denies film contrivances.  However, what escalates this film beyond other von Trier masterpieces (Breaking The Waves), is its use of over 100 steadi-cams in the filming of Selma's musical fantasies, which are extraordinary.  This inextricable blend of camera styles is what makes the film so aesthetically beautiful.  The contrived fantastical music skits are impeccably choreographed and balanced perfectly with Selma's abject reality; they are also used to further drive the story or reveal character's emotions.  Von Trier seems to be poking fun at the Hollywood musicals, while simultaneously celebrating and paying homage to them.  Selma is a character that any dreamer can relate to, and by the finale ""Darkness"" seems to be the only plausible choice for her, since her musical fantasies were viewed in ""Dark"" movie theaters where she is most happy.  A movie unmatched by any, and unlike anything ever put to celluloid.  As seminal as Intolerance, Kane, and 2001?  I think so!",970963200,30,1537,5.161290322580645
1278029,5,B00003CXKS,"If you are at all a Bjork fan, you must see this film.

 Everything about this film is brilliant. The entire cast, the choreography and dance direction, the musical score. The film takes musical motion pictures in a completely unique direction.  I just got home from the theatre and my heart is still in my throat.  This film is very heavy and has a tragic ending that may be hard for some audiences to stomach.  The film is about a woman working in a factory and taking odd jobs to save every cent she can to pay for an eye operation to save her young son's eyesight. Unbeknownst to him, she is rapidly going blind. She says she has seen all there is to see. She had her son, knowing he would have the same eye disease because she wanted to hold a little baby in her arms. She escapes the sadness of her life by day dreaming she is in a muscial and that there will always be someone there to catch her when she falls.

  "" When I am working in the factory, I like to pretend I am in a musical. In musicals nothing dreadful ever happens"" - Selma",970963200,2,1045,4.138613861386139
1278030,4,B00003CXKS,"Lars von Trier's new film begins with a Rorshach-like ink-blot test image that evolves into many things and nothing -- at the same time.  It is a unique cinematic moment, one that lingers for several unsettling minutes.
The remainder of the film is as powerful, hypnotic and ironic as the image which precedes the two-plus hours of drama and musical.
""Dancer In The Dark"" follows Selma (Bjork -- in her feature film acting debut), a musical dancer whose eye-blindness is worsening by the day. Her slow descent into visual darkness is accompanied by a slide into the enveloping moral darkness of the all-sighted people around her.
Selma can see the world beyond her and around her, but cannot see the world right before her -- in both an optical and symbolic sense.  She is trapped, confined by the contradictions of those who seek her solace and comfort.  She is manipulated and framed by someone she confides in.  When the moment arrives Selma is so loyal to a fault to this particular person that she risks her future in order to stay true to herself.
What keeps Selma going is her desire to see life in refreshing, vibrant colors -- in other words, via the rose-colored lenses of the idealistic world that she believes exists.  The musical aspect of ""Dancer In The Dark"" comes on slowly but is rich and alive -- in sharper focus and clarity than the heretofore Dogma95 von Trier trademarks: the drab color, natural light and high-speed edits and camera movement which compose much of this film.  Selma could be living in the musical world and dreaming in the drab, reality world she is caught in.  Or it could be the other way round.
The musical world represents a naivete, a fantasy, an innocence and purity through which Selma lives out her fantasies and desires.  She dances in the mind, in the heart and most of all, in the dark.
Aspects of this drama/musical are disturbing, not just because of Selma's circumstances, but because she has a pure heart and trustworthy soul, a soul whose foundation is battered but not defeated.  Her son, who also has problems seeing things clearly, proves to be the treasured being whom Selma works so hard for.  Selma shields her son from the harshness and indignities of the real world and what she does for him is done in the hope that he can see the same world she sees through even clearer ""eyes"" than her own.
The film's visual style is arresting and like all Dogma95 films -- disjointed, full of random imagery.  The editing style is effective, adding atmosphere and an authentic feel to the characters.  There are two memorable sequences in ""Dancer In The Dark,"" one which follows the film's critical event.  The balletic camera work and characters' choreography in this particular sequence has as much to do with the strength of Selma's vision and her fairytale notions about the world's machinations as the images themselves do.
Lars von Trier's film parallels several moments in the 1999 film ""The Green Mile"" and it is interesting to note that actor David Morse plays as prominent a role in ""Dancer"" as he did in ""Mile"", though certainly for different reasons.  Catherine Deneuve gives von Trier's film great weight and dignity in her role as Kathy, a character who believes she has Selma's best interests at heart.  Joel Grey has an impacting cameo in a pivotal scene, while Peter Stormare is endearing as Jeff, a ""Sling Blade""-type guardian angel who wants to make Selma happier than she insists she is.
Stellan Skarsgaard makes a cameo appearance as a doctor.  Most of all though, it is Bjork, who shines with an acting depth that deservedly won her Best Actress honors at the Cannes Film Festival last May.  Bjork should be seriously considered for an Oscar nomination in 2001.  The Icelandic pop sensation is central to scenes resembling the visual creativity she brings to her own music videos.  Bjork also wrote the songs and musical score for ""Dancer In The Dark,"" a film that intrigues, moves, disturbs and impacts in many other emotional and psychological ways.",970358400,12,4024,4.789017341040463
1278031,5,B00003CXKS,"""Dancer In The Dark"" is the stunning film by Lars von Trier that won this year's Cannes Film Festival and stars Icelandic alterna-pop queen  Bjork in her film debut. Set in 1964, Bjork plays a woman from  Czechoslovakia named Selma who imagines that she is inside of a Hollywood  Musical. This musical is not a happy perfect-world musical as so many  others are, but packs a stinging bite and a Sondheim-esque dark side. Early  on, the conflicts start piling up: Selma's son will go blind if she can't  afford to pay for an operation, and her next door neighbor stals all the  money she's been trying to save. Then, she is yanked from an small  production of ""The Sound Of Music"" when she is faced with murder  charges, and she winds up in prison.
As Selma's life gets worse and  worse, she retreats farther and farther into her musical-comedy daydreams.  She imagines that a celebrity is her father and she's not poor; she  imagines herself dancing with the man she's accused of killing. Although  Bjork's acting is superb, she has said that she does not want to act again.  She said she wants to be a ""person of the ears"", not a  ""person of the images"".
The soundtrack to this film is also  done by Bjork. Although the soundtrack its self is rather short (clocking  in at a scant 33 minutes), it's lack of duration is made up for in  abundance by it's beauty, passion, and intensity. The songs are a strange  mix of lush orchestral work and heavy industrial beats. Although it sounds  like a strange combination, it is a perfect blend for this film.
As a  lover of musical theatre, especially motion picture musicals, it is so  refreshing to see a new musical being premiered on the screen that isn't  trying to live up to it's own tired broadway run. I mean really, other than  ""South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut"" or ""Evita"", when  was the last really great film musical made? ""Annie"" back in  1982? ""Dancer In The Dark"" brings a breath of life to this dying  genre. I hope it will not be long bfore we as audiences are able to see  many more new musicals hitting the silver screen.",969408000,42,2088,4.510695187165775

After seeing the movie, I felt angry and horribly saddened, as if someone had just viciously killed my puppy. I swore that I would never see it again.

1278175,5,B00003CXKS,"This is one of the great films of modern cinema. It's a good story, brilliantly acted, brilliantly directed, and masterfully shot. I didn't know much about Bjork before this movie came out. In fact, I won't spoil this, but I CAN say that there is a visual lyricism here that meshes nicely with the audio sampling of everyday sounds that Bjork so uniquely blends into her songs. The film is not a cheerful Sound of Music kind of musical, but it is a necessary musical. It takes the art form of 'musical' to a new place. You simply have to applaud the achievement whether you personally connect with the story or not. I did experience a connection, a deep one, and it had a profound effect on me. It also opened the world of Bjork's music up to me as well.",1431129600,,754,4.3546099290780145

1278178,5,B00003CXKS,"Not to say that almost every project that director Lars Von Trier directs or has a hand in is exceptional, but he is just that type of filmmaker. This film is a wonderful balance of dramatic and musical theater. The main character Selma acted by the Icelandic female phenom Bjork, gives a stellar performance as a Mother and factory worker in rural America. She begins to lose her eyesight from a hereditary disease. Determined to save his eyesight she saves up the money for an operation to save his health. When a trusted neighbor does the unthinkable, Selma's life spins way out of control. In my opinion this is one of director Von Trier's more amazing directing accomplishments. Dancer In The Dark won both the Palme d' Or for best picture and the best female performance award at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival. In my opinion it is one of the most heart wrenching tear jerjink cinematic feats in film history. A definite gem for lovers of film.",1425513600,2,949,4.654761904761905

Selma, a young Czech immigrant to Washington state in the 1960s is going blind. Her driving passion is to save her young son from losing his sight.  Her choices are all to this end and she makes them without indulging in regret, self-pity, or blame.  The film bears a resemblance to Life is Beautiful -- the tragicomedy about the holocaust.

1278313,3,B00003CXKS,"I won't put a Band-Aid on it: this movie is wrenching and depressing. I bought it solely to see what the fuss about Bjork's appearance was about. To their credit, her presence is definitely that of a real character, not some secondary blip. Her amount of dialogue makes her a focus of the plot, and Bjork's acting is adequate enough.

Selma's philosophies about life are one of the big strengths of this movie - she has such a dismal existence that it's a joy to see her find comfort and peace through very simple means. For example, the sequence for the ""I've Seen It All"" song is actually a very warming moment because it's about as close as Selma and Jeff get in the entire movie. Selma lets her guard down quite a lot and - abstractly - lets Jeff in on her secrets. Her acceptance of her eventual fate is refreshingly practical without being mundane, and it's a welcome bright spot in the story.

The semi-musical format confused me even though I knew about it beforehand. The songs are alright (and perfectly up someone's alley if Bjork is already part of the music shelf), but their appearances are downright creepy because they are often done in stark contrast to reality. Part of Selma's downward spiral feels like an insanity bid, and I don't know if this was intentional or not. There's neither enough structure nor enough music for this to be a ""musical"" in the traditional sense of the word. The plot is dense enough, though there are some jumps that are explained very poorly. It feels like this film might have been a little stronger if it was a little less artsy. On the other hand, its ""differentness"" does make it stand out more.

The cast is alright, if not a bit jumbled together (really? David Morse and Catherine Deneuve in the same movie?). Peter Stormare is sweet as the shy Jeff.

I suppose this is strong enough as a movie, but the last half-hour (approximately) is so harrowing that you won't exactly run back for frequent repeat viewings. Watch it when you're in a fortified mood, or just buy the soundtrack CD and glean what you can from the music alone. Lars von Trier is, by and large, too pretentious for my tastes and I can't honestly say that this movie makes me want to go check out his other works. Treated as a standalone ""one-off,"" this movie is passable. Again, Bjork is pretty good in her own weird ways. The scripting is generally fine and the plot does work overall, but the other elements give me pause.",1372723200,2,2445,4.537414965986395

1278316,5,B00003CXKS,"How far will you go to help the one you love? Dancer in the Dark is a sad, thoughtful, controversial, and strange film directed by Lars von Trier.
The films stars Icelandic singer Bjrk, Catherine Deneuve, David Morse, Cara Seymour, Peter Stormare, Siobhan Fallon Hogan, and Joel Grey.
Dancer in the Dark is a musical and features original compositions by Bjrk. The song ""I've Seen It All"" was nominated for an Oscar for best song.
Upon release this film received many accolades & an equal amount of criticisms.
It famously premiered at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival and was awarded the Palme d'Or, along with the Best Actress award for Bjrk.
On the opposite side of the spectrum some reviewers found it to be overwhelming bleak in style, content, & stature.
The story itself is quite downbeat but I feel what you see depends on how you look it.
Either way, it is a film that all fans of film and imagination in general should watch at some point in their movie viewing career.
Overall it is a very strong artistic statement that can really shift & possibly rearrange the way you feel about life.
The story is about a poor woman named Selma who is going blind.  She has a rare hereditary disease that is causing her to rapidly lose her sight.
Her only son could suffer the same exact fate unless he undergoes a expensive major operation.
Selma works double shifts at a factory and saves every single penny to make sure her son will not go blind.
To escape the monotonous dread of daily life Selma slips in and out of musical daydreams.
If you are a fan of Bjrk's music you will enjoy the experimental musical element of Dancer in the Dark.
Throughout the film Selma is faced with an increasingly complex set of impossible decisions.
When it comes down to it, she must make the ultimate choice.
The concise point made in a direct & striking fashion that you will never forget: For true love sacrifices have to be made.
Bjrk described the process of making this film as the most difficult thing she ever did life.
Dancer in the Dark is extreme, goes all out, and you will never forget it. You may only have to watch it once but the sentiment will last.",1359158400,,2149,4.51025641025641

1278362,4,B00003CXKS,"Selma, a single mother from Czechoslovakia, is going blind and she's convinced her genetic condition will be inherited by her son.  She works a dangerous job at the factory in a small American town, and takes on extra work in the evenings in hopes of raising enough money to secure for her child a surgical procedure that may save his vision.  Her neighbor's a cop, who takes a fatherly interest in her son, and an uncomfortable interest in her savings.  Knowing that this is a Lars von Trier film, the third in his ""Golden Heart"" series about self-sacrificing women, you know it won't turn out well.  At the same time, you aren't likely to anticipate the delightfully whimsical way in which this film pays homage to and parodies the musical genre.  Musicals are always about fantasy and how the real world gets transformed into something more than mundane.  Here, Lars von Trier goes almost overboard to emphasize the drab ordinariness of the surroundings - the dull town, the dingy factory, the simple minded determination of Selma (played brilliantly here by Bjork, who also wrote all of the songs for this film).  So when they erupt into song - and it is always clear that these are Selma's fantasies, until the very end when a sympathetic guard decides to initiate and participate in the fantasy - when they erupt into song it is a welcome release.  At the same time the music always builds from sound motifs that are very much in the setting (the hum and clatter of machinery, the hiss and click of a broken record, the percussive rhythms of a slow moving train).  That fact establishes a subtle bridge between the hand-held realism of the everyday settings and the precision and flamboyance of the musical scenes.

All the performances are effective, especially that of Bjork - though I have to say that Catherine Deneuve's performance here didn't strike me as among her best.  She seemed to be going through the motions a bit, and I didn't feel as genuine the connection she was supposed to have with Selma - perhaps she didn't get along with von Trier?  (Of course, Bjork famously hated working on this movie and yet turned in a stunning performance).  I saw this when it first came out in theaters and just saw it again and was struck by how much it affected me this time around.  It's a beautiful and moving tragedy - that may require some patience from the viewer but rewards that patience with a very unique cinematic experience.",1300233600,2,2442,4.688524590163935

1278427,5,B00003CXKS,"WOW!  Talk about a tour de force.  My viewing memory of ""Dancer in the Dark"" happened half-a-year ago, a month after I saw my first Lars von Trier film, ""Antichrist"".  That film was wonderfully designed but the story was sparse and disturbingly exotic, so it didn't leave me a positive impression of what von Trier is as a director.  With Dancer, he showed me what he's capable of, making a cinma vrit film that's endearing at heart but uncompromising at social brutality.  Few movies have moved me in such a powerful way like this one, and it's a memory that can never go away.

Of course, the majority of the film's strength can also be thanked by Bjrk.  What can I possible say about her performance? She's the most abstract artist on the music scene, and there are other more comprehensive singers that acted in films before her, but she surprised me by how poignant she was. The character she plays is a frail, misunderstood foreigner who can barely speak English, which is a perfect casting choice for Bjrk because she too is a frail, misunderstood foreigner who can barely speak English. But that's not enough to just a play the part because both share similar quirks; one has to BE the part, and Bjrk manages to step up her game. So much so that this is the only movie she has acted, apparently because the film really strained her.

Her character named Selma is just unfortunate. Selma was a Czech factory worker who is actually myopic, but she kept that secret from everyone, except for her friend Cathy (Catherine Deneuve); she had dreams of being in a musical and enjoys dancing with company despite her condition. She also happened to have a son, and because her vision condition is hereditary, her son too will be as blind as her. Therefore, she's saving up money and lied to people about her savings so she can use the money for her son's eye operation. Sadly, her kindness and naivete has lead her to real trouble, mainly by the cause of a police officer played by David Morse (that guy that either plays a bad guy or a jerk in all his films), but mostly by her stupid choices.

Normally, I chastise characters who make stupid decisions like those in the film ""Babel"", but I couldn't hate Selma. One look at her face, and there's no way I can not sympathize with her; she appeared so innocent, she didn't really mean to make mistakes. The best way to compare her is a puppy: puppies tend to cause a ruckus, but you can't scorn them because they look so adoring, and seeing them abused is painful. When Selma experiences some traumatic events, they're unimaginably woeful. Bjrk's best acting prowess came in that one scene near the third act where she threw out that fragile state and being fiercely stubborn when Cathy did something that almost compromised her son's operation; THAT'S the sight of a concerned mother. She gave it her all as well in the final scene, which was simply cruel and heart-breaking.

Since Selma likes musicals, she daydreams about musicals which is rather sardonic. The way the film transitions to a musical number was brilliant and creatively designed: these numbers are vivid, well-shot and lively in contrast to the low-color, unfocused and dim real world that she's in; the musicals happen in her imagination and they halt whenever a real situation occurred, so the transitions were believable.  Her songs kinda bothered me at first, but listening to the soundtrack overtime, I end up finding them all mesmerizing, with the exception of 'Scatterheart' which has Bjrk's constant habit of singing out of tune to the music.  It's amazing how a movie so grim can turn the other cheek with a tune, and it does it so masterfully.

I can't recommend ""Dancer in the Dark"" highly enough. In retrospect, the story was far-fetched at times, but nonetheless the main actress has made the film profound and captivating. What an excellent musical drama.",1275782400,5,3886,4.713864306784661

This riveting, heartbreaking film won the coveted Palm d'Or for Best Picture at the 2000 Cannes Festival.  Bjork plays quiet, heroic Selma, a single-mom factory-worker secretly going blind and saving money so her son, who also has the inherited condition, can have an operation before he too becomes blind for life.  Bjork, who won Best Female Performance at Cannes, composed the startling, poignant songs that illuminate the images and emotions of a woman who retreats into a fantasy world ""where nothing dreadful ever happens"" while her real life spirals out of control.

What sounds sentimental and smarmy is anything but.  As written and directed by Lars von Trier (Breaking The Waves), this visually rich film toys with the blurred borders of reality and fantasy, hope and despair.

This movie is a unique, rare animal - no movie before or since it could ever capture its' essence, no film will ever touch you on such a primal level. ""Schindler's List"" comes close, but that was a historical telling.

Its called ""Selmasongs"" - do try to get it, and try to get past the amazing song called 'New World' without breaking down.

From camera angles, to the musical score, to the plot, to the cast, everything here WORKS. Lars Von Trier made his masterpiece with this film, and since then has been unable to create anything remotely interesting or hard-hitting.

1278520,5,B00003CXKS,"Lars von Trier is one of my favorite directors for he is unique in his visionary style, a director that takes chances and really pushes the envelope.  `Dancer in the Dark' is no exception for it is, in my humble opinion, a masterpiece of modern cinema.  Taking the beloved `musical' genre and ultimately reinventing it von Trier has served up one of the most heartbreaking and soul touching films in recent years.  Taking a musical phenomenon like Bjork and coaxing out of her a dynamic and Oscar worthy performance was astounding in itself, but Bjork is not the only wonderful thing about this movie.  It's a film about the power of love, not between a man and a woman but between a woman and her son, a love so strong that she would sacrifice her own happiness for his wellbeing.  `Dancer in the Dark' is one of those rare films that cannot be defined, cannot be pigeonholed for it is more than just a `musical', more than just a `drama', more than just a `film'.

`Dancer in the Dark' introduces us to Selma Jezkova, a young Czech immigrant who works herself to the bone to support her young son Gene.  She is renting a small place from a local police officer Bill and his materialistic wife Linda.  Bill and Linda are very kind to Selma, or so it seems, and they continue to include her and her son in their lives even going as far as to buy Gene gifts that his mother cannot afford.  Selma cannot afford these things because she is saving her money for something very important.  You see Selma has a degenerative eye disease; she is going blind, and it appears that her son may go blind as well.  She needs to get together a certain sum of money in order to pay for her son's surgery, to save his sight.  She cannot tell anyone this for if Gene finds out he can actually worsen his condition through stress.

Everything falls apart though when Bill comes to ask Selma for a loan.  All his money is gone because of his wife's incessant spending and he doesn't have the stomach to tell his wife the truth.  Selma explains to Bill that she cannot spend the money and she even resorts to telling him why but he takes it upon himself to steal the money from her.  In a devastating and heartbreaking sequence of events Selma finds herself standing trial for Bill's murder.  Selma's life has been one lie after another, from cheating on eye exams in order to continue working to lying about sending money to her father back home, and these lies, while harmless in themselves come back to bite her while on trial.

The acting in the film truly elevates it's devastation as well for the audience really comes to know and feel for the characters within the film.  As Selma, Bjork is a revelation to say the very least.  Her performance is so subtle, so brittle, so nave and she captures the light that is inside this very peculiar young woman.  In fact, Bjork gives one of my favorite performances of the past decade.  David Morse, one of my favorite actors as of late, works wonders as Bill, layering his emotions beautifully.  Catherine Deneuve is also amazing here as Selma's friend Kathy.  Her care and concern for Selma's wellbeing is believable and commendable and in the end heartbreaking.  Peter Storemare is reserved as Jeff, a man vying for Selma's affections, and Cara Seymour is effective as Linda, the money hungry wife of Bill.  It was nice to see Joel Grey (of `Cabaret' fame) in the film, although his screen time is limited.

In the end though this is a musical of sorts, and the musical numbers very well may be the most important aspects of the film.  It's within these musical numbers that Selma comes to life before our eyes.  Selma is obsessed with the cinematic spectacles known as musicals.  In fact the film opens with Selma rehearsing with a local theater group for a `Sound of Music' production.  She admits later that the reason she loves the musical so much is because ""nothing tragic ever happens in a musical"".  So, with that in mind these musical numbers provide a glimpse into the fairytale world Selma creates to help her escape her tragic life.  Usually these numbers follow something bad, or precede something worse.  As an example, after Bill's death he comes to life to sing a song of tragedy with Selma while dancing with her and parading around his house.  These numbers may upon a glance seem out of place but they add so much to Selma's character and the film in its entirety.

The climax of this film will, or at least should, leave its audience in tears.  I know I for one was an emotional wreck.  As has been mentioned, this is not a film for lightweights for it is very heavy on the palette but it is a remarkable achievement to be admired and respected.

First, the musical numbers; they seemed to me purposeless and obtrusive; telling the story straight would have given it more power and polish. Secondly, a classic tragedy also is capable of offering a catharsis, usually obtained by delicatedly handled irony (the villain--David Morse character--could have been divulged to a third party, for instance). Thirdly, filmed in Sweden and supposedly representing rural America, this movie is openly and vitriolically anti-American. Selma's trial is the stupidest trial ever put on film, bigotry admitted, and the system of justice represented here is nothing but a sadistic machine torturing a guitless and noble victim. Yes, injustices like that do exist and should be put on film. Raskolnikov has a dream of a horse being stoned to death. Kafka has Gregor Samsa die in utter loneliness as cockroach.

This is a great quote about an even greater film.  I actually saw this on election night in 2000.  I had to get the hell out of the house because I would have watched election returns all night.  The thing was during the film, I didn't think once about the election, the film is so intense and mesmerizing.  Lars von Trier is one of the greatest filmmakers working today, and this was another example of his immense talent.  I've seen almost everything the man has done (except The Kingdom II and an uncensored version of The Idiots), and all of it is worth watching several times.  The juxaposition of musical numbers in a relentingly sad and depressing story works amazingly well here.  Bjork's music is beautiful (von Trier wrote the lyrics for the songs), and as Damon Wise said above, this is not a smug, ""ironic"" film.  This is a passionate, sincere film that really rocks you emotionally.  There is no detachment here; you are involved whether you like it or not.  I don't care how ""hip"" you are, this will get to you.  It's a masterpiece.

The performances here are top notch, but Bjork's performance is out of this universe.  This was really her first true film role (she had a small role in The Juniper Tree years before this), and she's a natural actress.  However, working with von Trier proved too taxing, and she's never taken a lead role again (at least not yet).  But in this one role, Bjork's acting legacy outshines many other actresses who have worked for years.  She's so good here that she blow many Hollywood actresses with a longer list of credits completely out of the water.  Bjork's musical legacy is already set, and her acting legacy is set too just on the basis of this one performance, which is truly remarkable.  An amazing film that must be seen over and over again....",1167264000,4,2040,4.663865546218488
1278588,5,B00003CXKS,"Horrifically unsettling yet dramatically reassuring, `Dancer in the Dark' delivers one of the more memorable films in recent years.  Bjork, in her first and sadly I hear last theatrical performance, delivers a brutally moving and heart wrenching performance as Selma Jezkova, a young single mother from Czechoslovakia who has moved to the states to give her son Gene (Vladica Kostic) a better life.  That better life includes a surgery on his eyes that will prevent him from going blind.  Selma herself is rapidly losing her sight and fears that by the end of the year she herself will be blind.

Selma works herself to the bone, putting away every ounce of cash she can muster in order to give her son the life she is losing.  Selma rents a small trailer from a local police officer Bill Houston (David Morse) and his wife Linda (Cara Seymour) who seem to be living well off money Bill inherited from his late father, but one late night both Bill and Selma divulge their darkest secrets to each other, Bill the fact that he's run out of money and Selma the fact that she's saving up for Gene's surgery, a surgery that she's almost got up enough money for.

With those few words Selma sealed her fate, unbeknownst to her, and set the wheels in motion for her to see everyone's true colors.  This film, a brutally moral driven drama masked as a musical, strikes every chord wonderfully thanks to brilliant acting and directing and a wonderful thought provoking and completely engaging and original script.  Bjork is Oscar worthy, her raw emotions spilling onto the screen so effortlessly.  David Morse is another standout here.  He's become the standard villain, able to raise the hairs on my neck with just a glance in my direction.  One of the greatest films I've seen in recent years, that's for sure, and it's an experience that everyone should enjoy.

After it was over, I was truly ill.  Watching this movie reduced the quality of my life.  I will never see a Von Trier movie again.  He hates women and it shows.

The agony starts somewhere about 1/3 of the way through the movie and continues till the end, when it becomes almost unbearable. Bjork is so convincing in the role of a musical loving immigrant. The story that develops is so tragic, it made me cry buckets during the movie and left me feeling blue for days afterwards. Perhaps what was most tragic was the way Selma retains her innocence and her child like capacity for joy in her musicals even in her most heartbreaking and unfortunate moments. She remains loyal to her friend's secret at the cost of her life. She gets through the most frightening moments of her life daydreaming about musicals. Without musicals, she might have been paralysed with fear.

This movie will remain in your memory for a long time afterwards. But watch it at your own peril. It can leave you feeling very sad.",1151280000,6,897,4.6415094339622645

Since he is a great judge of which movies are truly great I decided to give it a try.  I am definately the kind of person who cries easily when a movie moves me,  and this movie affecting me more than any I have ever seen. I think for me part of the anguish is because I too am  the mother of a son with disabilities (aforementioned son is qaudraplegic due to a diving accident at age 17), and know first hand the feeling of being willing  to give up absolutley anything and everything to fix the life of a child that you love so much.  Anyway,  after experiencing this film,  I went into my son's room and said ""Thanks a lot!!"" as I sobbed and sobbed with my face in the blankets of the bed he pretty much lives in. I have never ever cried so much over a movie. In fact, I really want to see it again,  and would like to own it as I am a film collector,  but am not sure I could take it again! But if you can endure the intense pain of it all, and yes,  the musical sequences are a little ""out there"", this is one heck of a great movie- Bjork is phenomenal- I believe she really lived that role,  and can see why she doesn't want to put herself through anything like that again. I actually came to this site because I'm thinking about ordering it.

1278646,5,B00003CXKS,Forget memories of Bjork going to the Oscars dressed as a swan for her role in this film and about what a musical should look like. Bjork doesn't play Selma...she IS Selma in this powerful film. Selma is a single mom losing her eyesight trying to do what's right for her son. As things get worse she retreats into musical fantasies. Filmed like a documentary with drab colors the only vivid colors are in the fantasy sequences. The musical numbers aren't big crowdpleasing sequences but fit suberbly into Selma's emotional journey. Bjork is so emotionally raw it's hard not to be affected as the film goes on.

1278648,5,B00003CXKS,"""Dancer in the Dark"" is one of the ultimate films that divides people. Some think that the film is manipulative and implausible, while others are awestruck and incredibly moved. When I first saw it, I had practically no knowledge of what the film was about and had virtually no preconceived ideas. When the film was over, I was not only fascinated, but stunned for days afterward. ""Dancer in the Dark"" is a film that has affected me more than anything else I have ever seen. What Lars Von Trier has created is the greatest example of on-screen emotion ever.

The central character is Selma, played by Bjork in the role she was born for. Selma is a single mother from Czechoslovakia who has migrated to America with her young son, Gene. They both have a genetic disorder that will eventually cause blindness, and Selma is working herself into the ground to save money to organise an operation to save Gene's eyesight. When things get too much for Selma, she incorporates herself and her surroundings into daydreams of Hollywood musicals, which is her way of coping with her circumstances. Selma's landlord Bill is going broke and is afraid his marriage will be threatened if his wife Linda was to find out. He confides in Selma and, when they have both exchanged their secrets, Bill starts to get ideas of borrowing the money from Selma, which brings about serious repercussions.

""Dancer in the Dark"" is absorbing, ambitious, beautiful and emotionally assaulting. It is a very artistic and pure film. It is so unconventional from other films, and is therefore not very popular. It is filmed using the Dogma 95 guidelines, which were established in Europe. These guidelines focus on making films in a relatively basic way. Handheld cameras, natural lighting and shooting on location instead of using sets, are a few examples of the criteria. This technique is not something every audience will accept. A good deal of viewers will be put off by the sometimes chaotic camerawork and jumpy editing. But for those who can see it as an art form, it is a very welcomed style.

This is certainly a film that deserves more recognition. Fans have heaped praise on it, but it seems in some ways, the film has almost been forgotten about. Even taking into consideration that the film may not be a hit with mass audiences, it's difficult to believe that this film is not  available everywhere. But whether you love or hate it, it's boldness and originality cannot be denied. Lars von Trier is a director that is to be applauded. He is not afraid to be different, and ""Dancer in the Dark"" is impossible to forget.

Bjork is a woman of incredible talent, and she is absolutely amazing as Selma and deserves all the praise she has been given. Lars von Trier and Bjork did however, clash during production, and the disagreements did take their toll, as some of the musical scenes let the film down slightly. But overall, the film is an overwhelming knockout. It is the kind of film that could make almost anyone cry like a baby. Oddly enough, my first response to the film was not tears. Though I felt almost traumatised and wondered how I managed to sit through it, I just didn't cry. The tears did come however, on repeated viewings.

If you love art house films or are looking for something that is out of the ordinary, ""Dancer in the Dark"" is worth watching. As upsetting and unpleasant as it is at times, it is a film that should be seen, if you can handle it.",1136160000,6,3448,4.662828947368421
1278649,5,B00003CXKS,"Well, I thought this film was incredible.  I saw it for the first time in Sweden, while I was a little out of my element and maybe a bit more emotionally vulnerable.  Nevertheless, I highly recommend watching this.  But beware, because the emotion that you feel is so real and raw, like you are experiencing this first hand with Selma.  Second, because it deals with a situation that has happened in real life before (the frustration and desperation, the hopelessness, and fear, and also the hope that is brought forth through the musical scenes.  I have to admit that to watch this you had better be prepared to cry for two hours straight.  Be sure to have kleenex and maybe a few bottles of good beer ready!

1278722,2,B00003CXKS,"This movie is quite overrated. The music is repetitive and doesn't have the energy needed to really excite me emotionally. The most annoying thing about the work is the jerky camera movements that try to make this look like a 'documentary', a 'filmed on the spot' sort of thing. This doesn't allow one to be really engrossed in the movie, and it probably doesn't belong in a work that tries to show its main character's imagination and flights of fancy. But most importantly, the movie is really, really, really full of plot holes. Firstly, why did Kathy not testify for her friend, since she helped her cheat on the eye doctor's exam? She knew Kathy was really blind, so why did she just sit in the audience and cry? Secondly, how could Kathy have gotten the money to pay the lawyer since it had already been given to the doctor for Gene's operation? Surely he wouldn't have given it back to any stranger coming by asking about his patients. Thirdly, from a stranger's point of view, if Selma really cold-heartedly planned the murder of her landlord, why would she allow his wife, who witnessed part of the event, escape?

There are films where the plot matters little, and serves a purpose only as to explore the characters or a particular situation. However, I did not get the feeling after watching this movie that we are to leave the plot alone, and concentrate on other subtle messages from the film. The supposed 'power' in this movie depends very much on plot--and its inconsistencies only make the story, and its overall message, very hard to believe.

Besides these problems, the director tries to evoke emotion through cheap, tear-jerker methods. From Jeff's ""I love you"", to the guard's ""I know you love your son very much"" to the executioner's penchant for sticking to regulations, von Trier relies too much on cardboard villains and the beautiful-and-unblemished-but-lost-heroine type. In the end, it was just not at all believable or emotionally-appeling. During the last hour or so, I kept checking my watch to see when this mediocrity would finally finish.",1125187200,9,2073,4.853107344632768
1278723,1,B00003CXKS,"How can you make a bad movie with talent like this? Answer: film it with low quality videocameras and have so many bad things happen to the lead character that it becomes more and more unbelievable as time goes on. The premise is fantastic - a person who daydreams about musicals to make their crappy life more bearable. The execution, however, is skin-crawlingly bad. I was actually laughing by the end because it had gone so far past the point of believeability that it was getting like a Monty Python sketch. I was expecting them to sentence Bjork to double or even triple death by the end. The soundtrack is stunning though... maybe watch it with the brightness and contrast down (Dancer 'in the Dark', all makes sense now!). Lars von Trier sucks. Everything he's done lacks subtlety and joy and it always feels like he's forcing you at gunpoint to subscribe to his twisted point of view.

1278724,3,B00003CXKS,"Trust the perverse sensibility of von Triers to make a critique of a cherished U.S cinematic institution. He sets DID in the 1960s, the era of classic musicals whose narrative clashes of race or war were glossed over by the sweetness of song. Cognitive dissonance is the substance of his musical tragedy. He heightens the divisiveness by using a disabled Czech immigrant whose mindset on her adopted country is that of an 8 year old. At the beginning of the film it's difficult to accept that Selma/Bjork is old enough to have mothered a 12 year old. But Bjork's acting, in tandem with von Trier's legendary hand-held camera and documentary ambience, soon recruits our complicity to her heroics. Faced with congenital blindness, she works overtime to earn the dollars required for an operation which will save her son from the same fate. She will make the ultimate sacrifice to this end. By and large(true to the form of musicals), the narrative is devoid of confusing nuances. And it's more plausibly and artfully told than most screened musicals. The post-modern inclusion of a musical within the musical cleverly comments on the heroine's undoing; the jerky, home made grainy feel of the film mocking the extravagance of musicals. Bjork's acting warms to brilliance and her face is perfect for the myopic alien. If you are partial to her video-clips, you'll enjoy the parodic excesses of 'video-clip'sequences which I found disturbing. I find her croaking,stuttering and warbling insufferable, and her less strained singing quite moving. But the lyrics were banal and patronising.'Nothing bad ever happens in musicals' quips the struggling mum, as the world around her dissembles, and against ridiculous odds, the songs try to maintain such bouyancy. With magnificent unconcern, the actors resume the narrative oblivious of their'unnatural' burst of musicality. Given von Trier's penchant for pressing cinematic conventions, the irony of using a pop diva to clinch his sermon on musicals is a success. For this viewer, the constant and abrasive rug pulling made it a limited one.",1122854400,3,2082,5.181008902077151

1278726,5,B00003CXKS,"Bjork gives a towering performance in this cinematic masterpiece, one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. She appears in almost every frame of film, and she is such an incredibly sympathetic character that I found I was wholly in her grasp throughout the entire 140 minutes of film. I know, I know, so many superlatives in the preceding couple of sentences; but this film is one that many have said they either love or hate. I am definitely in the former camp; I thought it was outstanding, flawless perhaps.

I have always admired Bjork's originality in composition and voice, however was mostly unprepared for this acting display.

The premise is one of a person who has a congenital eye disease that has caused her to become almost totally blind. She (Selma, Bjork's character) has emigrated from Czechoslovakia to the US, specifically Seattle, or a remote part of it, where this movie is set, in 1964. She has brought her adolescent son, soon to be 13, and has worked tirelessly at a mind-numbing job in a metal factory, moving dangerous metal plates (a danger only exacerbated by her lack of sight). Her salvation comes in her wildly creative imagination, dancing in an amateur production of the Sound of Music, and in living for her son (who acts distant and remote to her for much of the movie).

This is a movie where secrets and mysteries gradually unfold, and the story is made more beautiful by this subtlety and nuance. Selma is almost saintlike in her sacrifices for the son she knows will likely suffer the same fate of blindness without a medical operation, for which she is saving relentlessly. She is trusting to a fault, and loving beyond measure, especially towards some who ultimately wrong her. The predicament she is placed in by her landlord (David Morse plays one of cinema's most squeamish cowards in memory) is horrendous. I do not want to spoil the surprise. This is a painful film to watch but also beautiful and immensely rewarding. The most surprising yet poignantly fitting moments of the film are when time stops and Selma (Bjork) embarks on several dreamlike musical numbers where dancing and soaring singing are featured. These parts of the movie detail the rich consciousness of Selma. The ultimate level of misunderstanding and villification which befalls her feels tragic, but also is somewhat of a release for her.

Anyone who can sit through the last half of this film without emotion is either cynical or worse. While unconventional and entirely original, this is a movie that you will not want to miss and provides a rich story of humanity.",1121040000,4,2590,4.826576576576577
1278727,5,B00003CXKS,"As possibly one of the biggest Bjork fans you're ever likely to come across, it suddenly dawned on me a few months ago that I'd been a fan for about 18 months and still not seen ""Dancer In The Dark."" This year I have started to collect the entire collection of Bjork DVD's, and although it will take me a long time to purchase them all, I'm determined to achieve this. Of course, Dancer In The Dark has to be a part of this collection too, and when I saw it on sale for 5 I knew I had to have it! I bought the film without really knowing much about it, and watched it one Saturday evening when I was tucked up in bed with the mumps!

This film totally absorbed me and drew me into its world of raw and pure human emotion in its simplest format. It took quite a while to really reel me in, but I'd say after the first 45 minutes, something clicked and I was sold. The film is directed by Lars Von Trier and received a standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival in 2000. During the filming, Bjork walked off the set for three days because she was so upset with Lars Von Trier. She was so angry she bit off a piece of his shirt before walking off! This movie is also classed as a musical because of the music sequences in it, but it's probably the most unconventional musical ever made. This is totally an anti-Hollywood movie, which is probably the reason why it was so overlooked.

Bjork stars as Selma Jeskova, a simpleminded Czech immigrant, who moves to America with her young son Gene. She has an immense love for musicals and is rehearsing her role as Maria in ""The Sound Of Music"" when the film opens. She works many hours a day in a factory and lives in a small house next to one of the town's local policemen. She pays rent to the policeman and his wife, and forms a strong friendship with them. Selma harbours a dark secret, however: she is going blind, and unless she can save enough money to pay for an operation, Gene will inherit her blindness. This is the reason she works so many hours in the factory, to save up enough money to pay for the operation. Any money she earns that isn't spent on rent or food goes into her little box of cash to pay for the operation. Her work mate Kathy (Catherine Deneuve) becomes a close friend to Selma, and takes her to the cinema to see her favourite musicals. As Selma's eyesight deteriorates, she confides in her police man neighbor Bill Houston (David Morse). He also reveals to her that he is having big money troubles since his wife Linda (Cara Seymour) has frittered all their money away on expensive things.

Later on, he asks Selma if he can borrow her money to pay off his debts, and that she will get it back at the end of the month. The money means everything to her, and she politely rejects his request. This is where the film starts to descend into madness, and Selma's life begins to spiral out of control. What makes this film so heartbreaking to watch is the fact that Selma is a genuinely nice person. She is a pure spirit and means no harm to anyone, and the fact that she does commit a horrific crime - no matter how cruel circumstances - is so tragic and disappointing. Bill is revealed to be a truly evil character over the course of the first hour, and his wife nothing more than a sheep who will believe anything she is told. Selma is prayed on because of her weaknesses, such as her compassion for others, and her deteriorating eyesight. Throughout the entire movie she maintains her innocence at all times, and accepts things as they are. In many ways, she's too kind for her own good.

We may occasionally forget that this is in fact, by definition, a musical. The central storyline is so strong that you forget all about the music at times. When Selma is feeling low, confused, scared or depressed, she daydreams and her fantasies become reality on the screen. The majority of the film is filmed by Von Trier with cameras that capture the human qualities of the characters, frequently zooming in on intimate situations, which creates the effect that we are peeping through a hole at the action going on. The colour is also rather dull, but the reason for this is so that once the musical segments kick in, we can see the remarkable difference between how Selma perceives her real life to her musical life. Songs performed include ""Cvalda,"" ""I've Seen It All,"" ""Scatterheart"" and ""107 Steps."" All the original songs in the movie were written and produced by Bjork, and can be found on the soundtrack to the film ""Selmasongs.""

OVERALL GRADE: 10/10

I was very pleased with this movie after watching it, but it really does shake you to the core. In the final ten minutes, I could feel my heart beating through my chest and my eyes moisten. This doesn't ease even on repeat viewings, even when you know exactly the grim outcome. If anything, you feel it more because you know what's coming in those final minutes. This is the kind of film that captures its audiences in those certain moments, and would hold an entire audience of hundreds silent and stunned. This is the most open and honest portrayal of raw human emotion I think I have ever witnessed in a film. ""Schindler's List"" only tops it I think, and that is only because the focus is on millions, and not just a single victim like in this film. Overall I would recommend this film to people who want a cinematic challenge, and not just your typical Hollywood film where everything turns out fine in the end.",1118448000,9,5442,4.4099502487562185

Final Grade: A+

This is possibly the most depressing movie I've ever seen. It rips you apart over and over again, without any hint of a happy ending. It's about as far from cliche Hollywood as can be, something Lars von Trier is known for. Bjork is an incredible, wonderful actress and I'd love to see her in a happier role, but she has sworn she will never be in another movie because of the emotional difficulties caused from her role in this film.

I am warning you, this movie will madden you, sadden you, and depress the hell out of you. I recommend it to audiences who appreciate art films. It is a musical (great way of challenging the sadness of the film), but mostly it is just a drama about losing everything you could possibly lose for the sake of love and compassion.",1116979200,61,820,4.410596026490066
1278729,5,B00003CXKS,"Yesterday I cried. I am the kind of person that would have to grapple for tears even at his mother's grave, but this movie made me cry. It achieves what no classical Hollywood flick (no matter what other qualities these may have) ever comes close to: a portrayal of simple, honest emotion. Here, at last, we see a pure and innocent human being, a paragon of  what can be loved about the human spirit, a symbol of whatever little hope there might be for the redemption of humankind. Selma Jezkova is an angelic figure unparallelled in modern cinema (with the possible exception of John Coffey in ""The Green Mile""). She suffers all she can to be able to cure her son from the progressive blindness he inherited from here, even while she herself is going blind, and finally makes the ultimate sacrifice to give her son a future, bearing all the consequences like a true martyr. Not unlike Jesus, but without the annoying sermons and the telling-other-people-how-to-live-righteously. Come to think of it, the parallels with Christ's sacrifice are almost frightening.

Other reviewers have gone over the story, and, besides, the plot is really circumstantial (so don't worry about the spoilers). This is not a naturalistic drama exploring cause and effect in a cast of real-life charactres, nor a psychological portrait. It is a moral play, a skillful condensation of the tragedy of human life, but it never becomes boring because of the beauty of the suffering. Selma is astonishingly beautiful, physically (even apart from the singing, Bjork is the only woman I could imagine in this role, owing to her fragile, elfish appearance) and spiritually: in the face of all possible adversity she retains her hope, escaping in the innocent neverland of musicals, ""where nothing bad ever happens"". Sure, at the end, facing death, she panics, but when 'Cvalda' hands her her son's glasses, telling her that he has been cured, everything falls into place. With the noose around her neck, she bursts out in a finnal song: ""There are no violins, this is the next to last song"". When you leave the cinema at the next to last song, the movie goes on forever. Then the platform drops and all is silent.

What makes the movie alive are the musical scenes. This is where we get the closest to knowing what it is like to be such a special person. As her eyes break down, her mind transforms the world into song and dance (yes, she is probably going ever more delusional, but what's the point of that?); the drab beats of a night-shift factory becomes an ode to joy, the rattling of a passing train a powerful lesson in resignation: ""I have seen it all - there is no more to see"" - ""You have never been to Niagara Falls?"" ""I have seen water, it's water,that's all"" (there is one version where Thom Yorke does the male lyrics, making it even more haunting). Bjorks singing may be as steadfast as the camerawork, but there is an undefinable ethereal quality to it that no other vocalist, however technically more perfect, could achieve. I have no idea what it is about Iceland that make musicians like her and Sigur Ros (admittedly the only other Icelandic band I know, but an astonishing output for such a minuscule population) so other-wordly, but it sure makes me wanna go there.

Some reviewers have argued that Von Trier is ""manipulating"" them into feeling emotion, using ""tricks"" like the surreal atmosphere of some scenes and the supperreal realism of others to wriggle a sentimental feeling out of them. What the...? What else can we expect from great art than to be touched by it, at least for a little while, to truly feel something that is not a product of our own small and boring existence? Then there are the arguments from those that miss the whole point and complain about Selma dancing with the man she just killed, or not being the utilitarian pig we all are and choose a chance for repeal above the health of our son (yes, maybe he would be happier going blind but with a living mother, even though probably in jail for the rest of her life - more poignancy to the story). And yes it's not a classical Dogma '95 movie (again, I have to admit that the only other Von Trier movie I've seen is ""Festen"" - which is good too, but very different) with all the not very hyperrealist asides, which in my opinion proves that the director is not just a one-trick-dog. The dumbest thing I've seen is someone renouncing the film because it makes a caricature of the judicial system, or rural America or whatever (""if you dislike america so much you should have stayed in denmark you buffoon"" - he did, actually). I imagine this is the kind of guy who considers liking Camembert ""unpatriotic"". Get the point, you buffoon.

But I'm getting carried away. The point is that is is a movie ""like an injection"", or more like a slow drip of this rare opiate, the feeling that there might just be something to hope for, that all is not lost. It is a feel-good movie, really, although maybe a bit different than the more conventional ones where the heroine does not die a violent death at the end. It has evrything, from slow, simple dialogue to dramatic action to intense moments of pure gooseflesh. It is sentimental, for sure, and what's more, it is completely unironic. Irony is the last resort for those people like ourselves who are afraid of what's real, and being ironic surely is preferable over failing at being real. But here it was not needed. It made you feel like a child again, and able to believe in fairy tales.

Of course, a few minutes after the curtain fell I was back to being the cynical grown-up that doesn't give a flying ef about the thousands of babies dying every day in Africa and thinks mandatory euthanasia for everybody is a pretty good idea, actually. But for a moment I was touched, and I'm not really sure, but I think that when Selma went into her ""next to last' song a tear formed in my left eye.

1278730,1,B00003CXKS,"Okay why am I giving this movie one star! I will tell you-first off,this movie is NOT for those in psychotheorpy! Everything from the plot,the photography,some of the acting and the overall direction is designed to go beyond the surreal,to frighten and even disturb the senses. It culminates in the very dramatic hanging of the leading character. But it is SO Lars Won Trier! So 'Dancer In The Dark' isn't a feel good movie. I first saw it when I was 18 and it scarred me so much I,like a little child stayed up all night with the light on. The oddly eerie soundtrack by Bjork is better heard on it's own away from the movie,not in this horrific conext. As a grown,mature man I actually left the theater nearly in tears.

  This movie is a brilliant surrealistic experience that is nothing like anything I have ever seen. And certainly the best marriage of music and film in recent memory-something of a grossly twisted varriation of the old MGM musicals. But this is not 'The Sound Of Music'.I certainly understand that not all films should have a happy ending but this not only doesn't but then pukes all over it by having such bizzare scenes as a freshly killed man suddenly arising and breaking into song. So this movie is OUT OF THE QUESTION even for the most tolerant of little children and anybody with mental dissorders-only those who aren't the faint of heart. Anyone who wishes to see this welcome to it because it may be the right movie for you. But not for me,by a longshot.",1116374400,6,1486,4.537313432835821
1278770,2,B00003CXKS,"An utterly shameless and unending grab at your emotions swathed in imaginary musical numbers.  Set in 1960's America (or is it 50's?), ""Dancer"" follows the misadventures of Selma (Bjork).  Both her and her son are slowly losing their eyesight - a predicament that only exacerbates a life spent in utter hopelessness.  To escape, Selma imagines herself as the center of many over-the-top songs - in which her sight is clear, her soul is loud, but the hints of her dreary existence remain at the edges.

Sound familiar?

I wanted to give this movie the benefit of the doubt, esp. since nobody has really given the musical-extravagansa a chance since the failure of ""Pennies from Heaven"", which this film lamely rips off.  Von Trier hasn't the nerve to try our patience with an anti-hero as unsympathetic as Steve Martin was in that flick, and the cards are so heavily stacked against Selma, that there's no point to even questioning her delusions.  Von Trier obviously had a nifty idea - how to riff on boffo-Hollywood movies while staying within the restrictive limits of Dogme (or, how to make an unnatural scene using enforced naturalism).  It's an idea that would have served this movie well were it not weighed down by a story that heaps injustice on our heroine.  Besides blindness, she faces exploitation at the hands of her landlord - a kindly yet feckless and gutless cop played by David Morse.  When Selma resists, the exploitation takes an absurdly tragic turn to murder.  Like ""Pennies"", ""Dancer"" climaxes in a trial, and both are sufficiently bleak to make the result a foregone conclusion.  Unfortunately, Selma lacks the character flaws that made Steve Martin's end in ""Pennies"" so fitting - he was innocent of the crime, yet of little else.  Von Trier in contrast demands martyrdom for Selma, even as her trial is a nonsensical depiction of the criminal justice system.  Perhaps a Danish judge has the singular authority to impose the death sentence with as much speed as he unrealistically believes capable of an American judge; fans of this flick may defend it as a fable, even though Selma's end and the sentiments it's likely to incite in viewers are quite literal.  It's almost as if LVT wants to create some incredible parable of American injustice, then blame Americans for somehow fitting his implausible parable.  (""Dancer"" is only one of several films LVT has helmed depicting the universal horror of mankind, but set in America; LVT himself has reportedly yet to set foot himself in America.)  Like some, I admit to feeling emotionally drained after this film - but the sense was more akin to being exploited, as I too were blinded and manipulated down a path to tragedy.",1116201600,7,2696,4.87719298245614

So, Selma-Gene's Mother-works a factory job, saves as much of the little bit of money she makes for his operation.  Then there is the desperation of her neighbor/friend.  He is a Police Officer, Washington State 1964 era, he is getting ready to lose everything he has including his wife.  Learning that Selma is losing her vision creates a demon in his mind, after asking her for a loan, and she says ""this money is Gene's"".  He threatens to kill himself.  Selma has a loving positive angle on life, no matter how bad things get she still has her imagination and her Musicals-where nothing tragic ever happens.  He finds where Selma hides her money and then waits for her to leave, steals it and puts it in his steel box, so his wife can see him counting it and feel proud.  Selma is forced to do something that she would never have dreamt of, but it is for the love of her son she is thinking at this point, nothing else.  Throughout the movie she has these visions of people dancing around her, she is the center of a musical, it is a magical and inspirational movie.  Everytime something went wrong she would simply go into her own world and daydream about her entire life as a musical.  This loving mother from Chechlslovokia? does everything she can to provide for her son, has a nice guy that eventually falls in love with her.  But she has no time for a boyfriend.  I think she gives in to that later, though.  The dancers are excellent, the Directing of this film is superb.  No matter what Selma goes through she still comes through with a smile on her face.

Bjork's specialty is quirky music and quirkier videos. This movie falls right into her genre, but is also a finely crafted masterpiece. It is a look into the life of a woman who's site is quickly failing and wants to raise the necessary money for her son to have an operation to save him from the same fate before she herself goes blind.

The actors in this movie do not have airs of stars- they all play their roles with exacting attention to detail. And Bjork does a great job. It was she who write and performed

the soundtrack. There are dance sequences to some of her songs throughout the movie, but they fit neatly into the plot. Actually, they provide the relief necessary in this intense film.

1278773,1,B00003CXKS,"It is with a heavy heart that I must write this review of what should have been Lars van Trier's masterpiece.
To begin with I need to point out though that I am no Van Trier virgin and was saving this film for last to complete the Van Trier cycle. I was perplexed by ""Element of Crime"", baffled by ""Epidemic"", enthralled with ""The Idiots"", amazed by ""Breaking the Waves"", and totally blown away by ""Dogville"". (I know there are a few missing but I can't find ""Europa"", and his T.V stuff doesn't count.)
I understand Van Trier's Dogme philosophy and therefore can give him plenty of leeway in certain elements of his films. So as DITD opens and we see his now trademark documentary style hand held film structure I was hoping for a treat. But I soon disovered it's single biggest flaw... believable characters. As a reference point one only needs to watch BTW to see that this type of man versus the world (in this case woman) epic film can be done well. I mean at least there was some point to Emily Watson's Neurosis, and she could be forgiven for some of her behaviours. But in DITD Bjork's raison d'etre is so utterly baffling and idiotic that I was actually looking forward to her untimely demise. To make things worse her supporting cast may just win the award for boneheads of the year with their ""Oh your blind!?"" routines.
Shame on you Van Trier you're much much better than this, and you've proven it with 1996's Breaking the waves. How this won the Palme d'or I'll never know.

Some of the characters are very connected to her on a spirtual level but they still can't completely recognize her behaviors as being of good intent. The film shows capitavitating footage of Bjork singing from her soul and how she is dealing with the blocks in her path. These vinettes are separate from the story but also allow the viewer to know what is going on in Bjork's character's mind. The ending is hard to watch, it is very symbolic of my views on the death penalty. I encourage you to view the film, it is definately an art film yet it has a message to offer. The unjust way on how things work, can be seen negatively or the viewer could actually see how even when things are dark we can still dance, we can hold onto a thought that brings us light in the midst of all the darkness surrounding our path.

years ago, I'd have to say that why Bjork wasn't even nominated for best actress in the Academy Awards for 2000?

Either way my sympathy for her was tested again and again, and now, after seeing Dancer in the Dark, after all the praise I heard and see written on this site, my sympathy for her is minor.

What starts out as a fascinating, intimate sketching of several peoples connection to each other in Washington state in 1964 turns into a anger-enducing, logic stifling, aggravating exposure of a woman's elimination from society.

Why the simple, poetic committment to Bill? (It sure wasn't mutual.) Was it love? Why the inability to express any argument to Bill's wife? (Especially for Jean's sake.) Why the lack of expression, for the sake of her son, of her predicament, in court, to Kathy, to Jeff? All of these actions, or lack of actions hindered her. Then, when the show is about to end, and she realizes she can't just leave the theatre she realizes the end. And her son is better off how? He might be able to see. See that he's alone, or has Jeff as a father? Not only did she not have to die, Bill didn't, she could have gotten the money back (hell, even put your arms out and feel if Bill is in the room, and wham, this is a different story) if she opened her mouth. In such dire circumstances, a woman whose most ecstatic state is opening her mouth to sing, couldn't even speak. Poetic, yes. Aggravation more so.

To me, so much of Dancer in the Dark was unnecessary. That lack of urgency in the face of doom, and the folly of whimsy shut me down and out. Poetic, yes. But aggravation more so.",1102377600,6,1710,4.35423197492163

1278821,3,B00003CXKS,"You could call DANCER IN THE DARK an ""anti-musical,"" but that might suggest that musicals up until this point have been a kind of static genre that needed this kind of corrective.

Actually, since at least CABARET and likely before, musicals have been less about ""Let's-put-on-a-show"" than ""Let's-explore-the-dark-side-of-our-souls.""  There hasn't been anything in the way of cinematic Sondheim so far, but from NEW YORK NEW YORK to HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH, film musicals have been getting less and less sunny and more and more ominous in recent decades.  In light of that history, how radical a departure is DANCER IN THE DARK really?  The sordid ""reality"" vs. the musical ""fantasy"" is not all that new.  The television version of PENNIES FROM HEAVEN did it at least as well.

The film's almost naturalistic reality sequences become almost as surreal as the musical fantasy sequences by the last third of the film.  While there is some internal logic to Selma's refusal to participate actively in her own defense, there is clearly no reason why others (her friends Kathy and Jeff, in particular) would have not been able to come to her aid more effectively. The trial and subsequent prison stay and execution are meant to be stark and disturbing.  To some extent these scenes succeed in that, but there is much about the last hour or so that just does not ring true--even in the stylized and distorted sense of ""truth"" that von Trier is trading on here.

The reviewers who complained about von Trier's ""anti-Americanism"" make a point.  European audiences, for instance, may eat this stuff up (it did win the Palme d'Or after all), but American viewers might find it way an un(der)-nuanced representation of American culture and our legal system, even if it's the culture and  legal system of 40 years ago.

On the other hand, as anti-death penalty films go, it is at least as good as DEAD MAN WALKING and much subtler and more effective than LAST DANCE.  Like those films (and so many other Death Row dramas), however, DANCER does give its talented cast a chance to shine.  Bjork's cinematic debut is impressive (and it's a real shame that the experience proved so traumatic that she has foresworn acting from now on).  Catherine Deneuve is quietly effective (although still a touch too glamorous for her role as an immigrant factory worker).  And it's always nice to see David Morse in a substantial role.

--beyond that, Von Trier not only fails his Dogme, but offers a critique of an American he really doesn't understand save through stereotype and rumor.  One can feel watching this film what Von Trier has proudly admitted: he's never been to the States.  I'm no big nationalist and invite insightful critiques of American culture, or any culture, none of which should be exempt from criticism.

--it seems to me that Von Trier is continually pandering.  His Dogme rules were an attempt to suggest that when he made films cheaply-and I've no problem with that, think, in fact, it is a lovely idea-they were somehow more artistic, and since he'd further adhered to his silly rules, they were even a cut above other independent films.  At best, it was a ploy for attention, and it worked.  His films sold more than they should have and his name grew bigger based on the buzz over Dogme.  Smart businessman.  With Dancer, he abandons the rules, and panders to a mostly European audience that wants to look down on America based on the stereotypes Von Trier embraces.

--he's really a sort of Emperor who probably knows he's quite naked, though it may be that he really believes in his robes.  In any case, I've seen few if any Von Trier films that really worked.  Breaking the Waves has an interesting concept but really is quite a mess.  Character is interesting but melodramatic.  I won't bother with Dogville.",1092614400,9,1441,4.781376518218623
1278824,4,B00003CXKS,"A darkly manipulative film which succeeds.

 Again, a non-Hollywood director shows us there is more than one way to skin the proverbial cat. Mixing these intricate, stunning musical sequences in with the ""film proper"" is necessarily a new device in the movies, but one rarely explored anymore and provides fascinating, penetrating insight into the central character that might not come through any other way. The stilted, almost painful ""Sound of Music"" sequences segue show into the rest of the film

 Criticisms about the film being manipulative are not entirely off-base, but what is wrong with occasionally being manipulated by a filmmaker - especially when it is done masterfully?

 Obviously this is not a movie for all, but to call it ""dishonest"" a term oft leveled at this film, I think is an error. I disagree also with critics who complained the tale's sense of ""sorority and female bonding"" being dismissable . . . damning. This movie did what I expected it to do, never bypassing my brain while going for the heart.

 Having established himself as a director who can safely integrate (well, perhaps safely is not the word) a simple plot with eye-popping visuals, Von Trier once again succeeds brilliantly. When the story takes its inevitable and penultimate turn, Von Trier unflinchingly marches it toward its conclusion and shatters those of us who've taken this journey.

1278825,5,B00003CXKS,"""Dancer in the Dark"" very nearly left me speechless. It is a tour de force on a variety of levels--the direction and acting, for starters, are superb. Bjork stars as a Czech immigrant living in a small American town with her young son. Eventually she ends up on trial for murder, and considering the horrific ending, Lars von Trier has plenty to say about the state of the American legal system.

 I would have never expected Bjork to be a good actor, or capable of exhibiting such a multitude of conflicted and complicated emotions, but she does. I forgot that I was watching Bjork on the screen; she totally inhabited the character. However, she does put her musical talent to use in the film. Her character uses music as a way to cope--she invents dance numbers and songs and acts them out to get through difficult situations, and these numbers are just stunning.

 I know that opinion on this movie is very divided--I had a friend who absolutely hated it, thought it was manipulative and phony--but I didn't think so and I loved it. Highly recommended!",1091577600,3,1056,4.661290322580645
1278826,4,B00003CXKS,"Like most reviewers, I have to say that I think Bjork's performance as Selma is absolutely stunning. It's a doubly make-it-or-break-it role: an actress could only either stumble or excel in the role, AND the effectiveness of the portrayal of the role could potentially make or break the entire movie. In this case, Bjork doubtlessly excels and, as I believe, saves the movie to some extent.

The first 10 or 20 minutes of the movie, as some reviewers have said, is quite hard to follow because of the unorthodox style of filming and the need to take in the background of the characters and all. But from that point on till the second third of the movie, things really take off. Emotions are strong and the musical scenes (especially the one with the lumberjacks) are sparkling.

But then I think things go downhill after the scene where Selma confronts her neighbor, Bill. It's because the plot is simply just TOO contrived. I have nothing against contrivances in general. But given the nature of the story and the way it's presented, I just couldn't swallow the contrivances. Were the story told in the form of a musical (I mean the kind of Broadway musicals where the audience expects everything to be exaggerated) or accompanied with a surreal setting, I would not have as much problem with the unbelievable plot development. But from the start till finish, the movie was filmed with handheld cameras which has given so much feel of realism to the story, and Bjork's (and I would also say Catherine Deneuve's) touching, genuine acting simply doesn't go well with the surprisingly artificial plot.

Way before the end of the movie, I already couldn't help feeling manipulated and thus couldn't emotionally get involved in the story again. From the incompetence of the defense lawyer to the lack of professionalism of the prison guard, it seems that every detail and every plot twist of the last third of the movie are there to merely emotionally stimulate the audience. To me, as said, it totally goes against the expectation of realism given by the acting and the way the movie is presented.

Overall, the movie as a whole is inconsistent in tone and could have been a wreck without Bjork's superb performance. Given the delightful acting and some remarkable sequences, the sum of the individual parts is easily better than the movie itself.",1091577600,5,2344,4.837905236907731
1278827,5,B00003CXKS,"Bjrk, an accomplished singer from Iceland who is best known for her progressive music, unusual style, and quirky personality, absolutely should have won Academy Awards for the her outstanding score and sublime performance in this phenomenally beautiful, yet utterly sad motion picture.  Why she didn't is beyond my capacity for reason, and is a testament to a commercialized Hollywood that rarely bats an eye at outstanding independent filmmaking.
 Working beside a knockout cast (including Joel Grey, Catherine Deneuve, David Morse, and Stellan Skarsgrd), Bjrk plays Selma, a woman who copes with the increasing difficulties of her life through music.  She suffers from a degenerative blindness, which causes her to lose her job - a significant loss, since she had been saving money to pay for an operation that would prevent the same blinding disease from befalling her son.  All the while, the cruel world around her works against her undying selflessness, and, in the end, she unfairly pays the ultimate price.
 Not since ""West Side Story"" has music been more of a compliment to a movie than it is in this musical.  The music, arranged and composed by Bjrk (and performed with original, effective choreography), is almost a being in itself, popping in at a moments notice when Selma hears the slightest rhythm of a passing train, a metal press, or even the light scratching of a pencil on paper.  It is through music that Selma finds her escape from an increasingly hostile world...and us along with her.
 This movie, phenomenally written and directed by Lars von Trier, raises the soul and the spirit, then brings it crashing to the ground as we witness the martyrdom of one of the most stirring and decent characters in recent memory.  Yet, despite the inevitable depression you may feel at the movie's end, you will feel fortunate to have even encountered a soul such as Selma in the first place.",1090108800,4,1903,4.977917981072555

However, I do not remember if I watched DITD because of her or if because my sister recommended it.  Probably a combination of both.  Either way, watching this movie was probably one of the most emotional events of my life.  I have never ever seen a movie more intense or moving than DITD and I recommend this film to anyone who would like to really feel again for a character who truly is beautiful and fulfills the highest ideal of any human being.
Let me just say that while this movie is rated R, there is little if any profanity and no sexual content whatsoever.  Rather, this film is probably rated for its extremely intense displays of violence.  In the scene where Selma ""kills"" David Morse's character, there is a sense that Selma does not want to do what she is doing and you can sense this in her sobbings as she slams a large metal box over Morse's face.
The final scene at the gallows is without a doubt one of the most cringing and intense scenes in movie history, rivaled probably only by the end of Part 1 of the Green Mile.
DITD takes you places that you most likely would not voluntarily want to go in real life.  Selma's sacrifice for her blind son is so beyond 'average American humanity'.  Although Selma believes in communism (heaven forbid, so Anti-American!), her selfless actions prove that there are no real lines of separation in our world.  The lines we believe are there are only imaginary.

Falconetti, like Bjork, the main character of Dancer in the Dark, decided never to act again after the traumatic experience.
Both Carl and Lars liked to purposefully film from a strange tortured angular way so as to thoroughly torment the viewer.  Lars's camera holding technique was more painful to experience, because he sometimes shook the camera, as if it were a home video making me want to practically throw up at times.  But in both films, the way that the camera is held, and the scenes are viewed give the viewer more reason to feel sympathy for the main character's plight, (in Bjork's case, that she was blind and poor and a single mother who needed to work to take care of her kid) ...(and in Falconetti's case, that she was imprisoned and humiliated for freeing her country of intruders.)  Each character always seemed cornered out, or set aside from whatever reality they had to confront.
The depiction of Selma by Bjork was just as honest and heartfelt and raw and real and tormenting to experience as Falconetti's portrayal of Jeanne d'Arc.  In both films, the acting is more as if the actors arent's actors but they just let the character of their story possess them and speak through them.
Also in both films, the music is incredibly powerful and moving and enhances the emotional situations that both women had to undergo and confront and overcome, even in martyrdom.  In DITD, the music is modernly inspired electronic music composed by Bjork and sung by Bjork, and has beats made from normal sounds in the surroundings in the film, whereas in the Passion of Joan of Arc, the music score was only added to the silent movie 50 years afterwards,  ...after the film was salvaged from its disappearance in a fire and found in the attic of a Norwegian insane asylum.  The Passion of Joan of Arc's music was done by a modern composer as well (Richard Einhorn) and sung by a choir and a female quartet of singers called Anonymous 4.
I'm sure that other comparisons can be made, if one views both movies in the same night.  My only complaint is that both movies leave you with the feeling that this sacrosaintly behavior from honest, defiant women who dare to step out of the lines and do what their heart, or their spirituality tells them to do, only get squashed in the end.  It's a real depressing view of mankind and what devastation we are capable of.
Leave it to two Danes to critique American society (in Dancer in the Dark, and Dogville) or tell the story of a French saint who was slandered as a heretic (in the Passion of Joan of Arc.)  Carl Dreyer got censored, his film was lost in a fire for 50 years and then found in an insane asylum, only to be restored and upgraded with a soundtrack that he never asked for but which made his film even more powerful.  Perhaps Jeanne's spirit was playing tricks on the movie that tried to portray her plight, and that's why it (the film negatives) went up in flames (as did she, in the end) and were lost for 50 years only to be found in an insane asylum (coincidence? ...her interrogators accused her of lunacy and of conspiracy with the devil...like a crazy person, or a witch) and then when the negatives were found, they were treated like a treasure, just as Jeanne was only called a saint hundreds of years after her death.
Maybe Von Trier will be just as cursed by the stories he tries to tell, (he tries to talk about America when he's never even stepped foot here, and never probably will) only that his are ficticious stories, and DITD was brought to life only by a fierce force to be reckoned with...a practically pagan and mystical Icelandic woman who can believe wholeheartedly in her character, Selma, and in the apparent reality and gravity of her situation, just as the people of Iceland can seriously believe in elves and gnomes possessing rocks and mountains and rivers.  (Icelandic people will build a road around a rock instead of destroying it, because they believe that the gnomes/elves would be disturbed or mad if they destroyed the rock or moved it.)  I think that this belief in characters and in spirits is obvious in Bjork's way of acting and being Selma and being true to Selma's plight, ...just as true as Falconetti was to Jeanne d'Arc's plight.",1086566400,7,4862,4.590542099192618
1278877,5,B00003CXKS,"I have no doubts about the beauty in this film.. it will be hard to watch if you haven't watched ""disturbing"" movies before. For me.. it was too. Which is odd because i am not disturbed very easily. I think bjork dying in the end is very powerful.. it may not make sense to viewers that a person could do this.. I am personally not entirely sure what the character was feeling at the moment. but what my guess is that she was very confused! She wanted her son to have the operation not matter what. I know! maybe her desicion was suppose to seem illogical. After all how often is it that someone you love does something like this! my mother kills herself trying to take care of me and my brother and even though i tell her to stop and that ill be alright she continues to come home and do everything to ensure our lifes turn out the best we could possibly be. well maybe bjork felt the same way. perhaps her selflessness blinded her from logical thought. she is a very emotional person after all!
In conclusion... for we have to go through pain and be disturbed to wake us up to the real good. although movies are only entertainment. they can still inspire you to better your life by stoping injusticed like this! Even if the plot has holes! (which i don't think it does) We must focus on the important part of it! what. it. shows. us.
the idea behind it!
ask yourself: have i ever watched a short film that made no sense
in the plot?
yes well i have..you know why thats not a bad thing??
it was filmed beautifully!
urban city areas.
the human form. good!
nature, trees, skys. great!
Everything is ART! remember that. although sometimes its nice to follow the rule of thirds. it just makes a picture whether moving or still look more attractive. But an director is an artist! im not sure if you realize it but its true! the difference is a director who realizes it or one who does not! the director who film dancer in the dance is and artist and definetly realizes it!
so are the cast and crew! maybe those uncertainties (imperfections) that other critics noticed were people who did not assume the role of an artist! its just like contemporary art.
performance artists, bjork is one. she realizes the human body is beautiful. that is important. Thats why this is such a great film. I cant tell for sure but from the evidence a large marjority of the people associated with dancer in the dark are artsy. they are not doing is out of selfishness. but just because they love expressing an idea. and the filming is just the transportation from them to us!
If you gave it a low amount of stars its probably because you do not see the truth. which it missing out on a lot because some people believe life is truth.

One that (at first glance) that I see underplayed among these reviews, however, is the one of selfless love, of true loss of the ego-self.
That said, as much as there is to gain from it, I cannot view _Dancer in the Dark_ again soon.  I admire and seek out unorthodox--even disturbing--elements in film, but this one had me in a place of extreme mental strain.",1084492800,3,519,4.5

 If you want to see an interesting musical, see this. I can't imagine you being a Bjork fan and having not seen this yet. One, Bjork is Amazing. Two, I've never seen a musical like this ever. I've never seen a film, that if you pay attention to and lose yourself in, will bring you so close to the experience of committing a murder. Afterwards, the part where she is delerious and starts daydreaming again.. wow. And the very end is so intense. I love the end. I couldn't believe Bjork was such a wonderful actress. I was so surprised. Blown away. This is one of my favorite movies. The kind you can watch over and over again and keep getting more from it. I love watching this over again. It is so intense; both amazingly realistic and highly fantastic. True to life and art. Very original. If you haven't seen it, see it. Unless musicals bug you. Though it's only part musical. The rest is filmed almost as if you are watching a documentary.. like observing friends going about thier daily life.. until it gets crazy. Pay attention. I Love this movie. The guy from Radiohead is in it too. And a bunch of other amazing people. I love the scene where the machines become music.

1278880,1,B00003CXKS,"After watching the first 40 mins of this film you feel as though you are about to witness filmmaking history... depressing musicals have been done before, (check out classical russian cinema)... but this was totally different, intentionally eclectic, blurry/shaky camera, as if we are seeing through Selma's bad vision or her mind's eye... i was thinking, this is brilliant!...
BUT THEN THE COURT SCENE begins... and then the film begins to push the limits in which a viewer can suspend his/her disbelief... if you want the details of why this is, there are about 50 reviews on this board addressing that very issue...
Being a lawyer, i can tell you this scene frustrated me to no end, but you don't need to be a lawyer to know how inplausable it was... ""Did you kill him?"" ...""yeah""...""why did you kill the man who robbed and framed you and almost shot you in the back?""... ""he asked me to""... ""Why did he do that""...""he asked me not to tell you""...""ok, well then, does the jury have a verdict...? what a surprise, death by hanging...""
WHY DOES HER BEHAVIOR FRUSTRATE US SO MUCH?
1) She, herself (the protaganist), does not seem to want to survive, nor to defend herself... and WE want her to live... not only for her child, but because she was innocent... I KNOW she was trying to sacfrifice herself for her child... she'll die so her son can get an operation....Yes, that is what the director intended, but if that were the case, then as a director you need to eliminate all plausable possibilities for a positive resolution... she had options to give her son the operation, win her court case and for a ""happily ever after resolution""... but of course she takes NONE OF THEM, but rather does everything to get herself executed... but acts like she doesn't want to die...
CONCLUSION: I really don't know what the last quote means that the director put up on the screen at the end of the film...
""They say it's the last song. They don't know us, you see. It's only the last song if we let it be.""
BUT, based on how disconcerting the whole court scene was and the aftermath thereof, it almost seems like the director was telling us that you shouldn't loose hope and life is precious and is worth living no matter how awful life is... THEN WHY THE HECK DO YOU MAKE US LIKE THE MAIN CHARACTER SO MUCH AND THEN SHOW US HOW STUPID AND CRAZY SHE WAS TO ENGINEER HER OWN EXECUTION....

1278881,4,B00003CXKS,"I've finally seen a movie by rebel danish director Lars von Trier, whose movies famously you either love or hate - and i don't know whether i love or hate it! One thing i'm certain of: this is a powerful, engrossing viewing experience. I couldn't turn the movie off from sheer curiosity at what was about to happen. In the first fifteen minutes i was transfixed, but baffled as to the purpose of this movie, but as soon as Selma (Bjork) tells us that she is going blind, and that she adores nothing more in the world than musicals, i was completely drawn in by Dancer in the Dark.
I think the seemingly rough way von Trier tells this story is what makes it so fascinating. Nicole Kidman, speaking about Dogville, said that you always feel von Trier right there with you because he is always operating the camera. By so doing, he is able to hand-craft a particular character for the camera, who becomes like an extra character looking on to the events in the movie, whose eyes the audience look through. The ""reality"" world in Dancer in the Dark feels just like reality, the hardness of which Selma loves to escape from by imagining she is in a musical. To give you an idea of the kind of profundity to be found in Dancer, here is my favourite speech in the movie:
Selma: ""Isn't that annoying when they do the last song in the films though... Because you just know when it goes really big, and the camera goes out of the roof, you just know its gonna end? I used to cheat on that when i was a little girl back in Czeckeslovakia. I would leave the cinema just after the next to last song was over - and the film would go on forever.""",1079654400,,1631,4.298701298701299
1278882,4,B00003CXKS,"Dancer in the Dark (2000), is a tragic musical (if there was not such a thing prior to this film, there is now) starring pop pixie Bjork. Unlike traditional musicals with glitz, costumes, bearded Jewish men overcoming strife and poverty to bring their families love and happiness, and little children with British nannies learning how to value people over price tags, Lars von Trier shows us how a very unassuming immigrant, Selma (Bjork) is in some ways saved by the pictures pirouetted into her heart, beat after precious beat. I'm still deciding if she can act, or if it was the direction that gave her such a powerful performance. Regardless, Dancer in the Dark is a presentation of a woman about as far away from Julie Andrews' vast repertoire as one can get.
The story seems a retelling of The Gift of the Magi, only with vignettes of musical numbers, representing escape for Selma as she works her fingers to the bone, scrimping and saving her American dollars for one lofty and personal purpose. Devoid of vision, Selma is an astute listener, seeing Babes in Arms in a factory floor late at night.
But why do they burst into song all the time?
Musicals, despite the bad rap they receive, were the first live theatrical animals. In fact, non-musical play actors were shunned. In life, emotion is often too great to exist and be shared with simple words. Using one's voice in song, or body in dance expresses a myriad of feelings, thoughts, and cadences unique to the genre.
The use of these flights of fancy in Dancer in the Dark are from Selma's perspective. The sounds of life as her orchestra allow her to create a safe and ""dread-less"" reality, as her own world is crashing around her.
No longer able to work, and robbed of her only dream: to save her son the same sightless plight, she makes the ultimate sacrifice.
Raw, throbbing, primal, and deep are the woes and decisions Bjork hands us here. WIth a supporting cast that never misses a beat, cruelly so at times, we are in agony as the final scene fades to the musical credits.
At times overlong in tangent, some songs do not further the story as they should, becoming repetitive and distracting, the overall look of the piece is perfect. The use of hand-held camera, close-ups on eyes and objects, all bring us into a mind that never sees her surroundings as one cohesive pattern.
It's not a happy film. Life is not always like the movies. Life is never just what we see.

1278883,5,B00003CXKS,"This is the most 'honest' film I've ever watched. The home-video effect, while really dizzy for me at least, gave the movie a very direct, straightforward quality that polished shots will never have. It makes you feel as if you're the one watching and filming the entire event with a camera. It brings you into the movie, as if you were there, holding the video camera, so much so that it really draws out your emotions and sympathy.
Bjork's singing adds yet another layer of feelings onto a movie already fraught with tension. I listened to the album 'Selmasongs' before I watched ""Dancer"", but when I heard the songs in the film again, they took on a new life. Especially 'A New World' which Selma sings at the end of the film, which is just about the most unforgiving, rawest scene I've ever seen, set off perfectly by Bjork's stunning voice and lyrics. Hearing the song in its original setting made me fall in love with Bjork's singing all over again.
The film has been reviewed as being satiric, somewhat political (ie, anti-american?) etc, but for me it simply stripped the reality of life down to its barest essence: hope, perseverence, betrayal. Put the trappings (setting, plot, camera work etc) aside, just focus on the film as it is: a very raw, painful portrayal of life and living and it'll eat your heart out. It was so emotionally draining watching it that I had to stop the VCD at least a dozen times just so I could pause for breath, and still I could hardly bear to watch the betrayal scene.

His last two big films, Breaking the Waves and Dogville along with this one have proven that. The acting is raw, powerful and tender beyond words. No one has been able to captire goodness as well as Bjork does in this film. To see her face smile or frown brings the viewer up to the same emotions and while one may be exhausted at the film's conclusion, it is a journey well worth taking. The musical scenes are fantastic and they truly do serve the story and move it forward. Without them, the film would be less than what it is.

1278948,2,B00003CXKS,"There are aspects of this film that are incredibly good and so many that are horrendously bad, that it's really difficult to review this film honestly.
To begin with, Bjork does a wonderful job in the role of Selma.  She plays the role with a pure, natural quality and a directness that blends perfectly with the documentary/home-movie quality of the direction and the cinematography.  I understand that Bjork has sworn off film acting forever because her constant battling with director Von Triers was so emotionally draining for her.  And yet their styles so perfectly meld themselves to each other that one gets the impression that they were both painting from the same pallette.
The basic storyline is essentially heart-wrenching --- by design.  Selma has migrated to America with her young son Gene.  She works every waking hour, both at her job in a factory and at home doing piece-work; all of this despite the fact that she has a genetic disease which is causing her to lose her eyesight.  The reason she works so hard, of course, is that her young son has the same disease and the only thing that will prevent him from meeting the same fate as his mother is a very expensive operation for which she is saving every penny.  Rather than keep the money she's saved in a bank (which they had even back yonder in 1964), she keeps the cash in a shoebox in the small hovel she rents from a local policeman.  The policeman, who has allowed his wife to squander his inheritance but doesn't have the heart to tell her that their savings have now been depleted, asks Selma to loan him the money but she politely refuses.  In an act of apparent desperation, he sneaks into her house and steals the money which, in a rather convoluted and not very well-justified series of events leads to Selma murdering him.  What follows is the aftermath of the murder during which Selma must face the consequences of her act.
For the most part, the screenplay is overwhelmingly sadistic - both to the character of Selma and to the audience.  I found myself having to turn the movie off after the murder scene simply because I was so distressed by the situation and sickened by the brutality of the crime.  It was during this break that I had time to think back and reflect on the way the screenplay was manipulated in order to maximize the amount of sympathy we felt with Selma by maximizing the level of cruelty that was being heaped upon her.  About half-an-hour later, when I resumed watching the film, I had trouble reimmersing myself in it, because I was now so wary of being manipulated and so determined that I wasn't going to be.
The musical numbers are quite enjoyable.  They're used to give Selma a device for dealing with the horrendous circumstances she finds herself in.  For Selma, as Bjork plays her, this is a perfecly natural thing to do and, plot-wise, it makes perfect sense.  However, I found the staging of the numbers to be very self-conscious - sometimes bordering on silly.  And poor Catherine Deneuve!  She's so out of place dancing this choreography that you can sometimes see her watching the person next to her out of the corner of her eye.  She couldn't appear more uncomfortable, which is a shame given the fact that she does such a nice job in the rest of the film.
I enjoyed the camerawork very much, although I've noticed that many other reviewers found it annoying.  The 'on-the spot' nature of it gave me a sense that I was experiencing the story first-hand.  It was as if, at any moment, one of the characters might turn to me to make a side-comment.  And I believe this is the reason the murder is so powerful and affecting.  This technique has been tried in other films, but I believe to less effect.
One aspect of this film that bothered me was what I perceived to be a rather strong anti-American sentiment.  I've never been a flag-waver although I do consider myself to be patriotic and I feel a certain sense of pride about being a citizen of America.  But I was offended by the undercurrant of this film which implied that all Americans have a rather blatant disdain for foreigners.  You'll notice that the only people who genuinely care for Selma and whom she can completely trust are her French friends, Phil and Cathy.  Every American in the film, except for the bulldog-like new friend at the prison, betrays her at some point in the story.  ""Americans appear to be nice people, but don't ever turn your back on one,"" says this film.
Collectively, the cast is solid and there's not a weak performance (except, perhaps, the aforementioned prison woman who's horrendous), but it's Bjork who carries the day and who makes you want to stay with this very uneven film to the end.  Ultimately, this had the potential of being a wonderful film.  Von Triers is a very talented director, but he needs to remove himself a little more from his material in order to tone down some of the more obvious and self-conscious plot and directorial devices.",1069372800,15,4967,4.624145785876993
1278949,4,B00003CXKS,"Lars Von Trier is a sadist. With ""Dancer in the Dark"", he continues the same theme of his beautifully bleak previous film ""Breaking the Waves"": He constructs a lead character that is loving, innocent, pure and humble, and then proceeds to have that character systematically degraded, humiliated, abused and finally killed. For what purpose? Most likely to show that modern society is no place for innocents. It's a dog eat dog world, and Von Trier doesn't want us to forget it.
Painful as it is to watch, this is a great film. The musical numbers that take place in Selma's head are a wonderful contrast to the gray, uninspired world she inhabits in real life. And Bjork is absolutely heartbreaking and mesmerizing playing one of the most tragic characters ever seen on screen.

For the first few moments of the film I was initally turned off by the dry dialog and the poor visual quality of the film.  Up until I witnessed the first musical number.

1278952,4,B00003CXKS,"First of all, a couple disclaimers:  First, I'm not gonna comment much on the ""musical"" parts of the film, and my review isn't really based on what I thought of them.  Suffice to say I understood their purpose, but I still thought they detracted from the rest of the film a little (except maybe the final one); hence the 4 rather than 5 stars.  Second, this isn't as much a review of the film itself, as it is a review of the reviewers.  So here goes.
I don't normally jump online to check out reviews of a movie right after watching it for the first time (if anything, I do so BEFORE watching), but in this case I made an exception.  That's because something else I don't normally do is . . . lose it emotionally while trying to watch a movie!  So I had to come here and see what others had said about it, to make sure I hadn't just gone senile or something.
Well, I'm happy to report that all is well . . . it seems that the vast majority of people had the same problem I did.  And so now I was satisfied, knowing that I was still ""normal.""  I had no intention of writing a review, but then I got the bright idea to sort these into ""lowest rating first,"" just for fun, assuming there wouldn't really be anything very negative.  Stupid move, cause now I'm really wondering about some people.
I've come to the only conclusion that seems plausible:  The people who have given this film an extremely low rating MUST be trolls!  You know about trolls, right?  They're the people who hang out on message boards just trying to aggravate others.  They don't really care one way or another about the subject being discussed, but still they take a position -- an EXTREME position, doesn't matter which side, just so it's extreme -- trying to get people going.  Anyway, that has GOT to be what's going on here.  We have people saying one or both of the following:
1) Bjork's acting is ""mediocre,"" ""amateurish,"" ""unconvincing,"" or something similar.
2) This film didn't move me at all emotionally, even the last scene.
See what I mean?  These people have GOT to be trolls!  I don't believe that any sane person could fail to realize that Bjork's work in this film was among the greatest EVER, male or female.  And I do NOT believe a living, breathing human being could sit through the last 15 minutes or so of this film without losing it.  But if I'm wrong . . . if I'm wrong, and these people are serious, I'd just note a couple of things about them:
1) They need to quit writing movie reviews, because they obviously know virtually nothing about acting ability.
2) They better get down to their doctor first thing in the morning . . . there must be something seriously wrong with the emotion-triggering parts of their brains.",1068854400,12,2717,4.398
1278953,5,B00003CXKS,"After watching Dancer In The Dark, I wowed never to watch it again. Not that it's no good, it's so good that at the end of the two-and-a-half hours, I was completely drained of all emotions while feeling utterly depressed as the film moves on.

Always worthy of mention is Bjork whose transition from a cool avant garde Icelandic singer to a musical-movie actress is very much commendable and credible. Her raw emotions and unpolished acting have been the biggest factor in making this movie work. Interspersed with well-choreographed musical moves throughout, Bjork brings to life Selma, the nearly blind mother who's working hard to save her son from the same hereditary condition but eventually gets robbed and hanged.

All the other actors, including the splendid Catherine Denuve, shines in the movie. The final scene in the movie culminating in Selma's hanging is overwrought with pure sadness that the scene remains in one's head long after the movie has ended. It leaves a semi-chill down my spine, thinking about the scene.

This may all be weird to some, but for anyone who takes a chance, this is a masterpiece. You'll either love or hate this, no in-betweens.",1068681600,4,1171,4.934010152284264

1278955,5,B00003CXKS,"""Dancer In the Dark"" is a movie creature unlike any other, a marriage of musical, Steinbeck, socialism and fantasy - a paean to the working class and the power of song. Lars Von Trier's film is steadfastly anti-capitalist, anti-death penalty and, by extension, anti-American. There are at least two good reasons to hate it, yet it is uncompromising, ambitiously realized, and technically masterful.
The story is stolen from the silent melodramas of cinema's birth: Set in the upstate Washington of the 1950s, factory worker and Czech immigrant Selma, played by pop star Bjork with something resembling transcendence, suffers from a hereditary eye disease that is slowly making her go blind. Her young son suffers as well and will too go blind without an operation that Selma has saved, penny by penny, her entire adult life to provide.
But there is a capitalist threat, manifested in Selma's ""friendly"" policeman neighbor (David Morse), who has led his materialistic wife to believe he has a fortune stowed away in his workshed. But the lockbox is empty, and the cop, frantic, learns of Selma's stash. He'll steal - and kill - for it, cementing Von Trier's assertion that ""wants"" can and do have a more lethal undercurrent than ""needs.""
Von Trier integrates this story, shot in drained-out, grimy realism, with full-production musical numbers that ostensibly take place in Selma's head whenever her words fail to explain an emotion or situation. Bjork wrote the songs - some are grating, but ""I've Seen It All"" and ""In The Musicals, Part II"" are the two brilliant sides to Selma's characters - and Von Trier staged them with 100 cameras surrounding the set, creating an panoramic musical atmosphere in unlikely locations: a factory, a train bridge, a courtroom and prison, where Selma is held after killing the bogeyman cop in an operatic murder sequence.
Von Trier's critique of democratic mores and justice is intricate and relentless; he indicts the swiftness with which Americans turn kindness into cruelty, and our attraction to scandal, and money. The murder trial fixates on whether Selma is a communist sympathizer, and whether a famous Czech dancer (Joel Grey, of ""Cabaret,"" in a fabulous cameo) is actually Selma's uncle. The verdict is preordained as Von Trier stuffs the angst a little further under our fingers; Selma's final days are not only a countdown to her death by hanging, but to the very day her son's condition becomes irreversible.
The plot, clearly, flies in the face of credulity. But Von Trier skill in melding silent movies, musicals and commentary is seamless. It is possible to dislike ""Dancer in the Dark."" You could passably render it boring. But in an era mostly empty of original cinematic statements, the movie is undeniably a work of art, and an essential viewing for students of the medium.",1068163200,4,2827,5.042735042735043
1279003,5,B00003CXKS,"This film stars Bjrk Gumundsdttir (as Selma) who proves to us that she is as good an actress as she is a singer.  She plays a poor immigrant who is trying to save money to pay for her son's eye operation.  Things get worse as she loses her own vision totally and falls victim to a cruel gambler.
Lars von Trier directs this graunchy film in the typical camera-swinging style of dogme films.  Most of the filming is done in very cool tones which takes a little getting used to, but it does an excellent job of creating an enormous contrast between real life and Selma's day-dream world of song and dance.
Catherine Deneuve is convincing in her portrayal of Selma's best friend.  She gives this film a real touch of class (as usual).
This film will take you on an emotional roller-coaster ride - be warned!",1064966400,,804,4.448979591836735

It was apparent to me that the story was a parable of sorts ....so it was all, in a sense, 'fantasy'...not just Selma's daydream sequences.  While I continued to be engaged throughout the film, it wasn't until the next day that it really struck me and I felt a deep sadness...(maybe I just needed time to digest it all).
What struck me the most was Selma's selfless and unyeilding commitment to 'right the wrong' that she inflicted on her son and the consequences she suffered due to her one ""selfish"" act (of just wanting to hold a baby).
With that said, I would have liked to have seen Selma and her son's relationship explored in a deeper way....it was difficult to really grasp her conviction to help her son given the lack of interaction between them on screen.
I would definately recommend this movie....but not if you're looking for a ""feel-good"" flick.  Also, I don't recommend viewing it right before bedtime...(I made that mistake, and had crazy dreams about the characters all night long).",1061510400,,1245,4.835680751173709

The story is quite a cliche - An almost blind women, tries to save money for a surgery for her son, and of course she finds trouble on the way..
What make this almost silly story so affective is the fact that all characters are extremly human. I dare you to watch the last scene without crying!
Bjork's acting is a bit amateurish, and can become annoying, but she has a certain naive charm that makes you love the character inspite all.  Catherine Deneuve is great and her cool style balances Bjork hysteric acting style (almost...).
However, this film continues Von Trier sadistic tendency of taking a bright-eyed, lovable heroine and abusing her so much that you feel like a sadist watching the film....",1059264000,2,930,4.705521472392638
1279006,4,B00003CXKS,"Lars von Trier is a co-founder and undisputed master of the so-called Dogma filmstyle (a manifesto of cinematic ideals founded in Denmark during the 90s).  But if you're new to von Trier, please start off with his masterpiece, ""Breaking the Waves,"" before attempting to take on ""Dancer in the Dark.""  Talk about bleak...""Dancer"" makes the gripping, despondent ""Waves"" look like ""Caddyshack"" in comparison.
Casting Bjrk as lead Selma Jezkova could have been a train wreck.  And to the extent that she and von Trier clashed during filming and will probably never speak again, it was.  But that creative tension produced some great work.  She's fabulous in this film.  She pulls off the most jarring of song-and-dance numbers with aplomb.

von Trier's casting always raises some eyebrows, though.  We're supposed to buy off on Bjrk, Catherine Deneuve (as a character named 'Cathy,' no less) and superb European character actor Peter Stormare as the Selma-smitten 'Jeff,' all aimlessly employed at a nameless backwoods factory in rural Washington during what appears to be the 60s.  Really stretches the imagination...especially seeing the regal, elegant Deneuve laboring beside a large machine press.

1279007,5,B00003CXKS,"This is actually a musical movie; the main character (Bjrk) sings everywhere in order to forget her worries, by the way, all the songs are composed and performed by herself; she even worked with Thom Yorke in a precious one, I've seen it all. These moments of brightness is the most outstanding in the movie for me, and that's because I'm a big fan of her. Also remarkable is the direction by Lars Von Trier; the camera is always carried on the shoulder of some operator and rarely stops moving. I think that decision is a bit risky, because this way of directing is seldom appreciated, but he does perfectly, managing to make the scenes more beautiful.
Bjrk really shines with her performance, something hard to believe not being an actress. Von Trier guessed right that only she could portray the character of Selma. It becomes so moving, I mean, her manner of escaping away from the reality and dancing immerse in fantasies of happiness, it's all so gorgeous! Catherine Deneuve is quite good in her role, too.
 The movie is so painful all the time because of the terrible situation around Selma and it will end sorrowfully, but at least her wishes will become real.",1058486400,,1168,4.669902912621359

1279009,4,B00003CXKS,"Like Lars von Trier's Breaking the Waves, this film's heroine is also guilt-ridden. She, Selma, has an eye disease. Yet, out of a desire to hold a baby of her own in her harms, she gets pregnant with a child; a boy. As her son grows older, unfortunately, he, too, will gradually lose his sight. So Selma, a mother without a husband, but fortunately with a job, is saving up enough money to pay for his eye operation.
Also, like Breaking the Waves, Dark is a tragedy. However, despite how uncompromising von Trier's screenplay is, the movie never feels very manipulative.
The film's heroine isn't dragged into harrowing situations, helplessly. More often than not, it's her own fault.
Selma is just too stubborn to not be to be to blame for the conflicts occuring in her life. She lies about not being blind; keeps secrets secretive, even when whether or not she reveals the truth means life or death for her. This characteristic was no doubt the product of being abandoned by her husband, thus being forced to raise herself and her child, alone. Selma may or may not be very bright, either, as you will most likely conclude when the sh** hits the fan. But despite her flaws, Selma is a totally sympathetic character, if only because she's a fan of movie musicals, and will one day lose her ability to ever watch a film again. For film buffs, this is a nightmare. Luckily, though, Selma can dream.
Actually, she daydreams, during the dullest moments of her life; whether at work, or while walking home. Interestingly though, her fantasies don't totally allow her to escape her reality. Some dreams push her towards the fate she will face in reality, instead of eschewing her away from them.
Bjork, my favorite singer, gives the sort of assured, moving performance, that one might expect of a pro. Sadly, this will probably be her last film.
But this isn't the last movie of filmmaker Lars von Trier, one of my favorite directors. How amazing, that such a film is less forceful in its drama than movies that aren't as tragic, or tragic at all.",1056585600,2,2041,4.6565096952908585

And as of me writing this review, I'm writing from a Bjork-fan point of view. THIS MOVIE IS VERY DISTURBING, disturbing enough factually that Bjork herself had said she would never act in anything again due to this movie's dramatic setting. I personally think she doesn't like it because of its dark message and we all know Miss Pixie-Queen is a happy-in-all woman. This movie is not happy at all, seriously, and me being a fan of Bjork, I found the ending to be too much, the first time was enough. It is  true that Bjork lacks vanity in this film, which is a positive note about this film, it's raw, edgy, and real. And she most definitely deserved the recognition she got from this film. From the beginning to end, she displays the uncoated side of the woman she really is, no makeup no over produced music, just straight homemade musicals and true acting from all the cast. This movie isn't for the faint of heart, hell I could bearly watch it myself and I like dramas. It's worth a first watch but I doubt you'll ever watch it twice.",1055116800,2,1210,4.353982300884955
1279011,4,B00003CXKS,"To many Europeans, America is renowned for two things: movie musicals and an ever-growing prison population. In Lars von Trier's controversial DANCER IN THE DARK, the director/screenwriter finds a fascinating way to blend the two USA trademarks.
Von Trier is a guerrilla filmmaker. His movies never unspool smoothly or flowingly. His camera work is jittery, abrupt, unfocused, and at times amateurish. These seemingly bad habits work well for his movies, which are all operatic, over-the-top, and raw looks at human behavior and misbehavior.
Like his earlier classic BREAKING THE WAVES, which introduced the world to Emily Watson, this newer flick debuts Bjork in a powerful, emotionally naked performance. Just as Watson seemed to morph into the mentally challenged, naive, fragile wife in WAVES, Bjork doesn't just play the physically ill heroine, Selma, in DANCER. She becomes this Czech laborer, a mother who is going blind and is desperate to spare her son from the same medical death sentence.
Bjork, an edgy singer/songwriter, provides the music for this rethinking of American song-and-dance epics. For those folks who think the film treatment of CHICAGO was dark, they should rent this title. Here is a weaving of tragedy and tap dancing, catharsis and choreography, shrieking and belting. It's not an easy blending to watch, and von Trier wants his audience to be uncomfortable.
Everyone in the movie sings and dances, at different levels of proficiency. The participants will never be confused with Gene Kelly or Leslie Caron, Fred Astaire or Vera Ellen. Instead, the whole cast (David Morse, Catherine Deneuve, Peter Stormare from FARGO)is set loose to express their rage, desire, confusion, regrets via lyrics and movement. Even while they are trying to carry tunes, they are still supporting the weight of the script.
Bjork is a revelation in this movie. She dares to look dowdy, unkempt, and REAL throughout. Her lack of vanity alone should have scored her an Oscar. I think there are very few actresses who would have consented and then courted such unflattering camera angles and cinematography. Her performance is so rich and so palpable that when her character exhibits fear and horror and animal terror at the end of the film, I actually felt my own stomach twisting and turning.
The last shot of this movie is so harsh, so brutal, and so poignant, that I felt my mouth drop open. I knew it was coming, but I still couldn't believe my eyes. I have seen a lot of movies, and DANCER IN THE DARK doesn't easily belong to any category. It is a musical, a crime flick, a slice of rural life, and a budding, interrupted love story.
Don't rent this if you want happily ever afters. Bear in mind, the finale will stay with you viscerally ever after.
It's that intense. The DVD is packed with alternate takes, commentaries, documentaries, and a device that allows you to go to Bjork's music directly. Take advantage of the perks and expand your mind.",1053648000,2,2961,4.983838383838384

The first musical number in the factory is whimsical and innovative.  The chaotic mood of this song is slightly reminiscent of the sugarcubes, and in my opinion, fabulous.  However, later, the musical numbers become darker and tormented, paralleling Selma's psycholigical distress.  The cinematography throughout the musical numbers is amazing-the vibrant colors, the camera angles-  and combined with bjork's passionate and completely unihibited emotion these scenes stand out as high moments of the film.",1044403200,,816,5.585365853658536

This was one of the most depressing and ludicrous exercises in filmmaking that I have ever seen. Frankly, I cannot believe that I watched it until the end! I could not believe that the cast broke into song and dance when they did.....even on Death Row!!!! Even if these were fantasies to allow Selma to cope, they were so out of place!
The other annoying aspect was the shakiness of the hand-held (I assume) cameras which cut off the top of actors heads and were sometimes out of focus,among other things.

What I like about von Trier is that he is not afraid to take chances, and he took some pretty big chances on this one, most notably casting Bjork in her one and apparently only film performance.  She was great! Too bad the rest of the cast couldn't measure up to her level of emotions, but then von Trier seemed to design it that way.  The story is a convoluted one and fails to make much sense.  Von Trier is after emotions and there are some very memorable scenes.  It doesn't have the tension of ""Breaking the Waves,"" one of the most riveting films I have ever watched.  Von Trier breaks the tension with whimsical musical scenes, which serve as day dreams.  I particularly liked the muscial scene in the stainless steel sink factory.  I never would have thought that Bjork had it in her to do a film like this, but she did.

Bjork is a goddess.
I have watched the movie, slept on it, and woken up still in a trance. It is a film that will creep inside of you. Bjorks music will live on in you. And the images will flash through your mind for days after watching the movie. If anything can explain how powerful this movie is and how mind altering it can be it is my little story that I will start my review with. My mum who found after only watching about 15mins of the middle of the movie too depressing ended up walking out of the room (she had no idea what the story was about or what was happeneing). I myself managed to sit through the whole movie although at times I admit this was very challenging. I woke up this morning to my mum who asked me ""how was the rest of the film?""...I simply replied ""it was the most amazing film. But also the saddest film I have ever seen.""...I then continued to explain the ending for her (as quickly as I could because she was in a rush to get to work)...well while I'm talking and explaining the ending my mum starts to weep. Tears are running down her face and I was shocked even further. For a woman who hadn't even seen this movie to so openly weep showed me that this film was a unique treasure.
I believe I did the right thing by watching the movie without reading any reviews and not studying it before viewing it. It is a movie that needs to be approached with an open mind and heart and to be taken for what it is. A drama/musical that is nothing like anything you have ever seen before. ( and I can guarantee you this.) Some people may argue that the movie is simply to sad and too depressing with no moments of happiness or joy. But I don't believe this. I found times when I smiled (even if this was through a veil of tears!) especially when bjorks amazing song and dance routines came into play and as a viewer you are shown that this woman who has had much hardship is still able to find happiness in something.
I will wrap up by saying that this is a very challenging yet rewarding film if you watch it all. At 2 and a half hours it is rather lengthy but not once did I find myself bored or distracted...just continually mesmerized. Some other reviews that I have read have stated that the first 30 minutes are rather slow but even I found beauty and was intrigued by the 4 minute musical montage at the very beginning that in the long run I never quite understood the relevance but found it unique like the movie and the actors and the setting and the story.
It is not a movie I think I could watch again in a long time. But would buy, simply to say that I own such an amazing film that I honestly believe will never be matched by anyone who tries to make anything similar in the future.

Selma is beaten down by life; a disease means her eyesight is slowly degenerating to blindness, she never knew her father, her son will get the disease too unless he has an operation. So Selma saves money, gets it stolen by her neighbour and ends up in Prison.
This film is about how despite all life and the external world may try to to crush you and hurt you, if you beleive in yourself and love your family and friends, our human spirit can soar above this petty world and be victorious.
Its also about the greatest, purest form of love known in human existence:
the love a mother has for her children.
And the fact that a mother is sometimes willing to sacrifice her own life (here, literally) for her children.
Bjork's fragility , her unconformity in a conventional world, her sense of humour and joy are ultimately what make this film so moving.

The jerky hand-held camera work comes off as sophmoric, ill-at-ease, poorly executed; terrible lighting, terrible angles...like it was not story boarded at all; like it was shot by a 15 year old film student with an 8 mm camera. A third of the audience gets motion sickness. I guess one can forgive Trier for substituting southern Sweden for Washington state, but why would any artist, director, or cinematographer consciously choose to present the audience with a plethora of poorly composed shots ?  But specific kudos to whomever conceived of the musical numbers. The music seemed to spring out of the guts of factory machines, and the state of naivte and confusion in the mind of Selma/Bjork. Each of the musical numbers worked like gangbusters; very creative. Ironically, during the musical interludes, the camera work smoothed out, and one remembered that Trier was also the director of BREAKING THE WAVES, and THE KINGDOM. But in between the musical moments, one was resubmerged into the poorly written dialogue, and the jumpy hand-held hell of the first part of the film. Yes, we know that Art is supposed to outrage and challenge us, and if that is the case then maybe this film deserved it's Palm D'or from Cannes in 2000. But it does not change the fact that one has to have the constitution of a Russian weight lifter to ride out the celluloid chaff, in order to hang on with our teeth and arrive at the emotional heart of the film. Ms. Bjork was filmed as unflattering as possible; harsh washed out lighting, and bizarre angles. Yet, despite all the stomach churning and antagonism, Bjork presents us with a Selma that emerges triumphant. She was beaten down, violated, cheated, framed, even destroyed, but her beautiful soul soared over us sprinkling a pure joy, a shower of white light, shards of pixie mist, like angel dust; and we are left expended, spent, weeping, yet uplifted.",1031702400,3,2050,4.890804597701149

Bjork becomes the character and takes you on this amazing emotional journey that you forget she is acting the part. She is truly that good and I have to say puts most of the Oscar Winners in Hollywood to shame. Bjork truly shows acting as a Work of Art and just seduces you with her performance. Here is a description of this wonderful movie with a little help from the back of the DVD. Bjork plays Selma a factory worker in America and a single mother who is losing her eyesight from a hereditary disease. Determined to protect her 10 year old son from the same fate, Selma is working over time and saving her money to get him an operation. In the evenings, Selma escapes into a world where nothing dreadful ever happens,"" rehearsing for a production for The Sound of Music with her best friend Kathy (Catherine Deneuve). But when a neighbor betrays her trust Selmas life spirals out of control and the lines between reality and fantasy blur and Selma begins to believe her life has become a Hollywood Musical. This is a provocative mix of drama and musical theater in which the movie won the PALME D'OR for BEST PICTURE and BEST FEMALE PERFORMANCE for BJORK at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival. Catherine Deneuve also gives a wonderful performace as Selmas best friend and makes this movie that much more enjoyable. This is one amazing musical and drama film that will inspire you and bring joy and tears to your eyes. Im not much in to musicals but this one is truly a Work of Art and a Masterpiece. Bjork deserved an Oscar for one of the most amazing acting performances to ever grace the screen.",1029542400,4,1753,4.498432601880878

Bjork has to raise enough money for her son to receive an operation for the correction of this hereditary blindness. Her son is not even aware of the situation at hand, but the plot slides through all of the hardships Selma goes through for her son and for herself.
This movie portrays what it is like to witness someone who lives their life with complete passion in spite of what has been dealt to them by circumstance. Von Trier's direction is incredible because he keeps his audience enveloped in visually rich scenes, while Bjork's character carries the audience with her voice and talent all the way to the tragically, climactic ending.",1029369600,2,790,4.947368421052632

The narrative is improbable but easy to follow and makes for some good drama. The whole movie is shot on DV and is mostly a colorless, handheld and dreary looking ordeal but, the song and dance numbers are filmed with many cameras and are a wash with oversaturated color as Selma disappears into her dream world of the hollywood musical.  I've read where Bjorks music in the film is criticized but I would guess that any fan of Bjorks music would be pleased with the film score.  Of course von Trier films are not for everyone but he and Bjork have done a good job at opening themselves to each others audiences, although rumors has it the relationship suffered.

1279202,4,B00003CXKS,"Remember the girl at the Academy Awards with the duck on her dress?  I've just watched the movie the song was taken from, Dancer In The Dark.  It's out on video.  The singer's name is Bjork, and she is from Iceland.  She composed all of the songs that make up the sound track, and she plays the lead role.  Her on screen presence as Selma Jezkova is every bit as unique as she was on stage for the Oscars.
 Bjork plays a single mother with a twelve-year old son who immigrates to a small town in Washington State, from Czechoslovakia, in the 1960's.  She has an inherited eye disorder from which she is rapidly going blind.  Her son also has the disorder.  She believes Communism is superior to America.  She is obsessed with The Sound of Music.  She believes that the only good things in America are Fred Astaire, Broadway and Hollywood Musicals.  She came to this country because it was the only place that did surgery to correct the condition.  She works in a factory and has no health insurance.  She works double shifts and does piece work at home to save the money for the operation-for her son only, not for herself.  What I like about Selma is that she is an innocent who is passionate and driven about the right things.  She looks very mousy and disheveled but is very much alive and in love with life.  She lives in a supportive community but keeps everything related to saving money for the surgery a secret.
 The only things I didn't like about this movie is that many of the sequences were done as musicals.  Sections of the movie are a little slow, but the last quarter is powerful and worth waiting for.  I don't want to give too much away, but the ending is similar to the ending of The Green Mile.  It's the kind of ending which makes you think about the meaning of life.  There is also an excellent acting performance by a female prison guard that I found both credible and provocative.
 It's very interesting that Europeans made a movie set in a small town America. And, by the way, whereas Hollywood likes happy ending, Europeans like movies with sad endings.
 Bjork's singing reminds me of the Irish singer Enya, but I don't care for Enya, and I do like Bjork's singing.  She is much more passionate.  Dancer also reminds me of the movie Savior, both in the similarity of Bjork's singing to the Serbian folk songs on the sound track and to the movie ending.
 Bjork is the pop, ""Diva,"" of Iceland.  Dancer was her first acting role, and she won Best Female Performer at the Cannes 2000 film festival.  She has gone back to singing now, but I'd love to see her in another movie role.

About that dress at the Oscars, I can't imagine that whoever designed and picked it had ever been out of Reykjavik, but all of the comments on the Internet, all from Europe, think the dress was absolutely gorgeous.  Go figger.",1026432000,2,2830,4.447470817120623
1279203,5,B00003CXKS,"Lars von Trier has offered us a gutsy movie that defies easy categorization.  If you are looking for a film that explores new territory, this is a good place to start.
The story-line of the film is of operatic proprotions.  Bjork (in a riveting performance) plays Selma, a Czech immigrant who is going blind.  Her son suffers from the same condition, and she is working double shifts to earn the money for the operation that will spare him from suffering her fate.  Her situation is desperate as the film opens, and it goes downhill from there.  Along the way, the themes of guilt and redemption are explored from many different angles.  The end is shattering.
The scale of the tragedy is larger than life.  The filmwork is jarring.  Selma's one pleasure in life comes from the musicals, and the film incorporates a series of spectacular musical numbers in which the film lurches from gray to technicolor.  The stylized nature of the presentation serves to draw us even more deeply into Selma's very private world.
The musical numbers are all freshly staged -- Lars von Trier used multiple cameras to film them all in one take, and then edited together the results.  The musical for ""I've Seen it All"" is one for the ages, but all the rest are memorable as well.  (It was unfortunate that Bjork chose the infamous swan-suit for her performance of this song at the Oscars.)
You might well hate this film.  You might well love this film.  I'm not always sure which reaction I have.  But you haven't seen this film before -- and that's saying a lot.

No doubt, there plenty of people with some serious mental disoders, but this woman has some of the worst I've seen.  Imagine brutally killing a man with an gun and suitcase.  Most people, except maybe serial killers, would be wildly shaken by the act, but this woman goes on as though nothing has changed.  She is basically a daydreamer who lives in her musicial words not caring for the outside world.
The story is set in the 1960s.  There is a reason for this, but it hangs on by a thread.  She works in a factory where she gets bored quickly.  She imagines she is in a musicial where everyone in the factory is singing along.  That had to be one of the strangest sequences I've ever seen in any film.  Strange because it showed just how WITHDRAWN this chick is.  The other problem of the 'Dancer in the Dark' is the director.  This man feels he must shake the camera ALL the time.  Not just in certain moments, but ALL the time FOR GOD'S SAKES!!  I found myself yelling at the screen, ""Stop SHAKING that camera!!  I'm getting VERY dizzy!!""  At least Oliver Stone knows his limits.

1279208,4,B00003CXKS,"Like most reviewers, I have to say that I think Bjork's performance as Selma is absolutely stunning. It's a doubly make-it-or-break-it role: an actress could only either stumble or excel in the role, AND the effectiveness of the portrayal of the role could potentially make or break the entire movie. In this case, Bjork doubtlessly excels and, as I believe, saves the movie to some extent.
The first 10 or 20 minutes of the movie, as some reviewers have said, is quite hard to take because of the unorthodox style of filming and the need to take in the background of the characters and all. But from that point on till the second third of the movie, things really take off. Emotions are strong and the musical scenes (especially the one with the lumberjacks) are sparkling.
But then I think things go downhill after the scene where Selma confronts her neighbor, Bill. It's because the plot is simply just TOO contrived.  I have nothing against contrivances in general. But given the nature of the story and the way it's presented, I just couldn't swallow the contrivances. Were the story told in the form of a musical (I mean the kind of Broadway musicals where the audience expects everything to be exaggerated) or accompanied with a surreal setting, I would not have as much problem with the unbelievable plot development. But from the start till finish, the movie was filmed with handheld cameras which has given so much feel of realism to the story, and Bjork's (and I would also say Catherine Deneuve's) touching, genuine acting simply doesn't go well with the surprisingly artificial plot.
Way before the end of the movie, I already couldn't help feeling manipulated and thus couldn't emotionally get involved in the story again. From the incompetence of the defense lawyer to the lack of professionalism of the prison guard, it seems that every detail and every plot twist of the last third of the movie are there to merely emotionally stimulate the audience. To me, as said, it totally goes against the expectation of realism given by the acting and the way the movie is presented.
Overall, the movie as a whole is inconsistent in tone and could have been a wreck without Bjork's superb performance. Given the delightful acting and some remarkable sequences, the sum of the individual parts is easily better than the movie itself.",1021766400,7,2339,4.832917705735661

1279261,1,B00003CXKS,"I know why Bjork has decided to stop making movies. Somehow she got stuck in this laughable film that is just so dumb at times I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I liked a few of the songs, and Bjork's angelic beauty and charm sucked me in. It's easy to feel empathy for her and her son. Her world is interesting and it's nice to visit in her dream like theatre productions of her imagination that cause things to go wrong in the real world. Where does this film go bad?
1)Camera work is horrible. It movies and is never in frame of the characters heads or body. It's always off and you fee like it's a home movie of strangers.
2)The songs get boring after the first few.
3)The story get's rediculous when theirs a trial. And for some strange reason Bjork will not explain why she was saving money? Why is that so wrong? She could have told them without any consequences. It was just dumb that she allowed herself to be found guilty. They also let her testify against herself, Where was her lawyer? That was just dumb and implausible.
4)It DRRRAAGGGEEED on for so long...just before it was done another song came up. Until you just want it to end already. They also get rediculous when she starts singing at her trial and at the inevitable ending. It just doesn't make sense.
5)At times the film is sad, as when Bjork is forced to do the unbelievable. But the rest of the film makes it all feel like a joke.
The trial stuff should never had happened, and a potentially interesting musical with a good actress was ruined by practically everything else.

1279262,5,B00003CXKS,"Lars von Trier (the director) and Flannery O'Connor: A preamble
After reading an extremely wrongheaded review of her work, the Catholic author Flannery O'Connor remarked that large sements of the American population seemed to have had the moral sense of God ""bred out"" of them. This state of things was problematic for her, as she worked from a worldview that most of her contemporaries did not share. Consequently, her writings were often misunderstood or misinterpreted as ""hopeless"" and ""nihilistic."" Actually, O'Connor saw them as optimistic-- but hers was not the sort of optimism that holds that things will always ""go right"" in this world. Rather, it was born of a deep faith, grounded in a fundamentally spiritual view of life-- a view that, while being quite earthy, always treated the spiritual as the ultimate and most important reality. I consider the Danish director Lars von Trier to be her cinematic kindred spirit, equally gifted and equally misunderstood. This film is his magnum opus.
Review (proper beginning)
I don't want to give away too much. ""Dancer"" is probably best seen fresh, with little foreknowledge of its contents. Then, one can fully experience its power. The innovative musical artist Bjork portrays Selma, a legally blind Czech woman who comes to America in the early 1960s to procure an operation to save her son's sight (he inherited his condition from her). She works long, punishing hours in a factory, saving her money. The job is repetitive and almost unbearable, but when it becomes too much, Selma ""escapes"" into her imagination, visualising musical dance sequences with the people around her. These sequences are daring, and one of them, particularly (set to Bjork's ""I've Seen It All""), is transcendant in its beauty.
As the film progresses, Selma's plans for her son's operation take a tragic, unforeseen turn. However, she is absolutely unwilling to compromise her wishes for her child. For her convictions, she suffers unimaginably. The last hour or so of the film is very painful. However, there IS light. There IS hope. Whether or not one sees it depends very much on one's view of life. Is this life the most important reality? Do we cram in as much self-serving pleasure as we can while we're here, and that's it? Or is there something else, which casts every one of our choices and experiences on earth in a different light? How one answers this question may determine whether one views ""Dancer"" as a work of artistic ""sadism""-- or profound, selfless love. I opt for the latter.
To some critics, Selma is an an ""unrealistic"" character. No one in the real world acts as she does, they say. Here, I think those critics miss the point. Selma is that rarest of characters in modern art-- she lives IN this world, but she is not OF this world. Lars von Trier has created an incredibly moving character in her, a model of what it means to be one's ""brother's keeper""-- but as most film critics don't share von Trier's spiritual aesthetics, they see her suffering as ""needless"" and ""excessive."" They miss the point that this is what Selma is willing to DO, to go through, for her child. They miss the great kindness that the guard shows to Selma (if only such kindness were more present in everyday life!). They miss the redemption beyond Selma's suffering-- the redemption that left me awestruck that this film was even RELEASED in these cynical, jaded times. The last several minutes of ""Dancer"" take on a truly visionary quality. Selma stares hard into the darkest moments of human existence and somehow manages to see beyond them. I, for one, will never forget this part of the film. It is otherworldly in the best, truest, and most soulful sense of the word.
Do you believe that you can only truly have something when you give it away? Do you believe that a movie can radically affect your view of what really matters in life? If so, you need to see ""Dancer."" If not, you still need to see ""Dancer."" Great, meaningful modern art is rare. Thank you, Lars von Trier, for this cinematic rarity.",1017878400,3,4041,4.832611832611833

1279266,5,B00003CXKS,"""Dancer in the Dark"" has proven to me that Lars Von Trier is the greatest filmmaker of our time. Here is a filmmaker who is trying to do something new and original and succeeds brilliantly. Unlike many of his peers he brings something to his art, contributes to the growth and advancement of the film medium rather than working in proven conventions that have been the norm since the begining of the sound era. This film caused me to question the way we look at films. What is film as an art? Must a film have beautifully unnaturalistic shot compositions and a script that moves from A to B to C to be considered ""art?"" Or can art be gritty and truthful like this and Von Trier's Breaking the Waves? In time films like this will get the recognition that they deserve. Once audiences minds are opened to different styles of filmmaking other than the typical Hollywood fluff.
Dancer in the Dark has a simple dramatic story. It concerns a factory worker, from Europe, living in America in the 1960's. SHe is going blind and is secretly saving money to get her son an opperation that will prevent him from suffering from the same affliction. When the money is stolen the heroine, Selma, is forced to make a decision that sends her life spinning out of control. As her eyesight fails her Selma retreats into her mind, and her love for musicals, and the film breaks out into spectacular song & dance numbers. The song & dance scenes give the audience break from the drama, as they do for Selma in her reality, as the film heads toward its inevitable conclusion.
See Dancer in the Dark and open your mind to the many possibilties of film. There has to be more than one way to make a film.  Dancer in the Dark is a start and hopfully it will open the doors for other styles of cinema.",1013731200,3,1776,4.431192660550459

It has been called a musical melodrama.  It is musically happy, emotionally sad, tragically violent and contains a gripping finale.
Bjork convincingly portrays Selma Jezkova with child-like innocence, hardly seeming to be a mother of a 12 year-old. Her personality is placid and sweet. The ethereal sounds of her child-like voice might require some getting used to.  She can sing in a low whispery sometime squeaky breaking voice.
Von Trier used the hand-held camera angles as originality, but that camera technique gives the movie an angle of a real live documentary, a style Von Trier intended.
What proves even stranger in this melodrama is the way music is introduced and interspersed. Selma lives in her own world and it comes alive when the stress peaks. She escapes at the rhythmic sounds of the banging, pounding pipes against metal, and the hissing noises at the factory where she works making metal sinks. Quickly, Selma is swept into the Hollywood musicals she so loves. The kicker here is that anyone in the scene becomes part of her musical fantasy.
Selma Yozkova shares a trailer home with her son Gene. Selma, going blind, works to save money for an operation that will save her son from the hereditary impending blindness.  One pleasure Selma has is seeing old musicals; her friend and coworker and friend Cathy (Catherine Daneuve) often becomes the eyes for Selma. Cathy and Selma perform evenings at the community theatre studying the ""Sound of Music."" In Selma's fantasy world, she also believes that in musicals, ""nothing dreadful ever happens.""
What dreadfully happens in her real world is disturbing.  Here is where the series of events take a drastic turn. It is heart wrenching to see her struggle, not so much for her own life, but for the crucial operation for her son.
The climax is extremely emotional. It is complex, morbid, touching, heartless, etc. See it! The movie is 2 and  hours, but you don't seem to notice the length.  See it for its originality. .....MzRizz",1010966400,7,2264,4.986737400530504

The hand-held camera work and rough edits are an endearing stab at avant-garde film-making, and make a nice contrast to the gorgeous music videos.

1279323,5,B00003CXKS,"Let me start by saying that the plot for the movie is somewhat unbelievable and a little hokey.  That, however, is made completely irrelevant due to the acting on the part of Bjork.  Bjork does not play the part of Selma in Dancer in the Dark, she IS Selma.  Very few performances have ever brought me to tears, but this was one of them.  This is an extremely depressing movie as well.  I felt like a worthless human being for several days after watching this movie.  The way the movie incorporates the musical numbers is just amazing.  I don't want to give away too much, but the song 107 Steps was just so mindblowingly amazing.  The DVD is also loaded with special features which are really good.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.",1007596800,4,741,4.470149253731344
1279324,2,B00003CXKS,"A few caveats before the review:
I had just read The God of Small Things, which is similarly infatuated/nostaligic about The Sound of Music. The Sound of Music was before my time: I do not have warm fuzzy feelings towards it: I'm sick of seeing it embedded in other fiction.
(At this point, stop reading if you don't want to know how the film will end.)
Second,as an American, I am probably reacting too emotionally to the way justice was dispensed. I am not be the best judge of what is a fair depiction of our legal system.
If van Trier would have over-leapt the court room scenes, the lawyer scenes, and any interaction with the legal system, then we might have had a good movie. But he insisits on giving the Prosectution interminable minutes to make their case. On the other hand, Bjork's attorney is never shown saying anything. Bjork is put on the stand, grilled by Zeljko Ivanek as the Prosecution, with no explanation of why she is on the stand. Ivanek, a decent actor, seems to be used only because he looks like a sadist.
Later Bjork gets a brand-spanking new lawyer who can get her off the hook. She cross-examines her lawyer to find where the money has come from; he cracks under the pressure, divulging the amount and thereby the source of the money. $2000 and change. When it comes to death penalty cases, $2000 will get your pulse checked to see if you are dead already; that's about it.
There are, however, lawyers that take such cases pro bono. And let's see: blind young mother speaks English poorly--not an unattractive client for an attorney who has issues with the death penalty, oh no. And I submit is the only reason van Trier set the story in the United States is because the death penalty is still used here and thus Bjork can be made into an even bigger martyr.
One other complaint: fiction that relies on fools not putting their money in a bank and then losing it or having it be stolen is at best unimaginative and desperate.
I don't have any problem with the film technically. The jarring and the close-ups, which at times seem excessive, cumulatively have an undeniable power. The musical scenes fit well with how Selma deals with her world. I especially appreciated the opening scene of a painting being conceived, the growth and layering of colors.
In short, I was very disappointed after being dazzled and shocked by Breaking the Waves. (...)",1007424000,7,2376,4.606132075471698
1279325,4,B00003CXKS,"I am most grateful to this film for having no part in the usual formula movie-making.  While its plot is somewhat standard, with a predictable outcome and conflict with a character who early on confesses he is broke (and we know she is saving a wad of cash, what could be more predictable as a conflict generator), its acting and singing and color/filming are extraordinary.  This film is as memorable as they come, connecting with the sky over our heads, the roads we walk on, the parking lots outside of our jobs that we trudge across.  The open air filming, the lack of studio pretensions are wonderful.  The high point for me was the musical interlude ""I've Seen It All"".  It encapsulates the experience of saying goodbye to the world's gorgeous colors and sights, and to family, and to life, and Bjork's song, and the lanky actor joining her and the railroad hobos dancing, and the bright sky all converge to make a magnficent film moment that I found to be utterly breathtaking.  Her life is grim and yet, the beauty of the blue sky, the world of love and families -- the heart of the film is about loss.  I highly recommend getting this film.  However, I do find the plot devicing clunky -- I just don't believe Selma had the self-destruction in her to overlook a loving man and the villain begging to be killed is fake, something out of a Perry Mason episode, not real.  Despite its plotting flaws, Bjork is something to see.  I hope she does make more films.  She has an original presence, something very honest to contribute.  What a shame if it's all the Brad Pitts of the world on film instead of people like Bjork whose faces are special, different, interesting to watch, whose visions and voices are a touch of magic in a mundane world.  The opera of everyday life is conveyed here, and it's a great movie effort.  It didn't find a wide audience because too many people need mindless entertainment, and originality frightens people.  Even though its setting is the U.S., nothing about it felt American to me, not the factory, or the trees or the houses.  At first, the shaky camera work annoyed me a bit, but thank goodness I let go of that prejudice and let the film tell me where it was going.  It's worth the ride!",1007337600,3,2231,4.523690773067331
1279326,5,B00003CXKS,"I beg to differ with the opinion of the last reviewer!  Dancer in the Dark is unlike most films you would see in regular ""mainstream"" cinema.  The innocent character, Selma, played by Bjork, draws you straight into her story and keeps your attention.  This is a wonderful story about a hard-working immigrant mother slaving her days to make a better life for her young son and daydreams mostly about musicals, which sometimes lands her in trouble.  In her daydreaming, Selma has a tendency to create a musical of her own which is played out in the movie scenes as well.  The diversity of the camera angles, and not using your typical still-cam, gives the viewer the perspective that you are watching Selma over her shoulder with all the trajedies, mishaps, and comedic times.
Bjork plays such a wonderful role and obviously has taken the character's personality to heart as she gives an absolute stunning performance.  This film deserves much more credit than the last reviewer has given.  With Bjork helping in the creation of the musical score any fan would appreciate this dramatic film.

If you are someone to pull apart a film piece by piece then maybe this film will not be for you.  From an artistic point of view, there are some quirky points to the film...the flow of some dialog between some characters, the distorted camera scenes...but it all makes for a stunning performance.  In essence, it all works together.
I wouldn't say it is a masterpiece, but it stil deserves 5 stars in ratings.  Give the film a chance.  Bjork will grow on you.  Selma will grow on you and the film as well.",1007078400,,1597,4.701438848920863
1279327,5,B00003CXKS,"I'll forego critiquing the technical aspects of this movie (although they play a big role in my liking the film) because other reviews have successfully dissected von Trier's vision.
Instead, my review will be based on my emotional response to the movie.
I reacted so strongly to this movie, and that alone should say a lot. But my reaction went deeper than the usual sobfest. I experienced total and utter sympathy with Selma's character. Selma may've been an oddball, but I could relate to her. Why is it so far-fetched that a hard-working woman would want to give all that she could to save her son from the doom that faced him and her too? It seems to me that this is the story of most people. What meaning is there in life if not for the people we love?
The strange persona that Bjork lent to Selma's character only helped to immerse me in the movie. But it was more than Bjork's magnetism that made Selma. Her skillful acting made me feel like I was watching Bjork herself, just Bjork in another life or in some parallel universe. She seemed as real as life itself, and this was great because for all of Selma's whimsy, there was a tangible, warm-blooded human being under there. It's almost as if we needed Selma's larger-than-life personality to draw us in, so that we could witness the story truer to life, the story of suffering that reflected those pains deep within us.
This movie shouldn't be disregarded as a tired melodrama or as Lars von Trier's attempt to simply shock or manipulate the audience. Why must we walk away from this movie, angry at the emotions it is asking us to get in touch with? These days it takes so much for a story to be interesting anymore, yet when a movie makes a solid effort at unconventional story-telling, it's criticized merely for its daring. What about the story, the message?
""Dancer in the Dark"" is remarkable if only for this one fact: it captures that final (and still, UNfinal) moment at the end, when Bjork is singing out her soul; a scene filmed so starkly and unsympathetically; it's trying to show that the beauty in real life's ugliest moments is ten times more beautiful than all the fantasy and make-believe we create. Selma's peace was achieved not in a moment of whimsy but in a brave and frightening moment with herself. And she found that the love in her heart was just enough to get her through the final hurdle.",1006646400,3,2377,4.55607476635514

1279390,4,B00003CXKS,"I decided not to write about this movie until I had seen it a few times.  It is very hard to know what to think after you watch this movie for the first time.  So I watched it again, and again.  FInally I realised that it is a good movie, in a certain sense.  It is not like most movies you could think of today and it probbaly won't ever be wildly popular, yet it deserves the praise it has received so far, and to a certain extent the criticism.
One of the arguments people cite against this movie is the camera work and the acting. For the camera work I agree that for a lot of my friends who I forced to watch it, the camera work was distracting.  I myself didn't mind it after a while, it lends itself to the film, and Lars use of odd, sometimes uncomfortably close, slopping, angles, and shots created a certain feel.  At times it seemed almost like a home movie, shaking camera's, with odd and abrupt skips in the continuity of the scenes.  The Musical scenes were strange and surrealistic at times.
Many people have a problem with the musical seens themselves.  They seem out of place at times, sometimes even hokey.  Yet like the musicals the character Selma relished, these musical scenes served as a kind of escapism from the norm, the real hard, cold cruel world.
Bjork's acting was good, wonderful in fact when you consider how little film experience of this magitude she has.
Dancer in the dark, is a good movie, that is worth seeing.  It won't leave you feeling good, or even satisfied by some accounts.  Like I, you may have to think about it, and view it twice, thrice etc. before you realise exactly what about the film you liked (the which is the reason it won't be wildly sucessful here), but if you take time chew on you will.",1004745600,4,1747,4.344615384615385
1279391,5,B00003CXKS,"This was definitely a heartwrenching, tragic story.  Hats off to Bjork for not portraying Selma, but BECOMING Selma, for drawing out sympathy, pity, frustration, sadness, anger...but also respect for a woman moving from valley to valley, yet still managing somehow to allow her love for her son to keep her head up.  One can't help but wish her life was like her musical daydreams--vibrant and beautiful.  Evil wore a new face--one created from desperation, pride, and fear of rejection--in the character of Bill, who, at one point, I had to keep myself from screaming at on the TV screen.  At the end of the movie, I found myself weeping, as if Selma were my friend who just got a raw deal in life.  Even after the last closing credit scrolled up the screen, I was still crying.
Rarely does a film touch my heart so intensely (i.e. ""The Color Purple"", ""Steel Magnolias"").  I can now add ""Dancer in the Dark"" to that elite class of cinematic art.",1004313600,,946,4.634730538922156
1279392,5,B00003CXKS,"Dancer in the Dark is a sad, but beautiful comparison of the basic difference between strong and weak people, and the resulting tragedy when circumstances throw them together.  Selma, the single-mindedly devoted mother, is as desperate for money as Bill, the police officer who is her landlord and friend.  But their motivations are vastly different.  Selma works long and hard, racing against her eventual blindness to earn enough money to allow her son to have a preventative operation that will save his sight.  She must deny herself and her son many material things in the process, but to spare her son from the stress she faces, she resists explaining why she cannot even buy him birthday presents.  Bill, on the other hand, has allowed his spoiled wife, Linda, to overspend to the point that he has exhausted his inheritance and fallen deeply into debt.  Yet he lacks the strength to deny his wife in any way, or even to admit that he can no longer support her every whim.
The greatest triumph in the depiction of these characters is a skillful step away from all-good/all-evil typecasting.  In the beginning, Bill and Linda do some genuinely good things for Selma and her son.  Bill's incomprehensible decisions are made out of a weak attempt at self-protection, not outright ill-will.  And even Selma makes questionable choices (and, yes, mistakes).  However, even in the worst circumstances, she is never distracted from what is important, following it through regardless of the cost.  While Bill victimizes others to protect his own image, Selma protects even those who do not deserve protection by remaining true to herself and to her promises.  The result is tragic, but it is the only result that could possibly be reached by these characters.  The effect is beautifully accented by Bjork's natural charm and excellent musicianship, as well as a strong international cast (including Catherine Deneuve, Udo Kier, David Morse, and Joel Grey).
By yanking the formula of musicals out of the entertainment realm and injecting it into a story with real conflict and pain, the result is a modern musical with incredible power.",1003795200,,2132,5.0227272727272725

P>Von Trier blends two worlds perfectly--Selma's drab and difficult life alongside her fantasy musical world.  At first I thought this was too jarring, but on second viewing it worked.  The film is extremely well made and acted.  There are some very difficult scenes throughout and they are acted superbly.  Bjork does a tremendous job in what was surely an emotionally draining part, but everyone in the cast really does an outstanding job.
I recognize the superb qualities of this film, but honestly it's not one I care for.  Too tragic, and the second half of the film really was milked and dragged out to get the most boo-hoos.  Strangely, I didn't cry with this film, even though I'm usually a big waterworks at films, especially tear-jerkers.  The other problem I had was that Bjork's singing is not my cup of tea.  I respect that she is a good song writer and that hordes of people love her quality of voice, but I really have a hard time getting into her squawks, groanings and skirting around solid tone alternating with her soaring moments.

One cannot help but feel every emotion possible and ask every question about life and love: why we have children, why we choose to live, how we love. What will one sacrifice for another? What are we trying to preserve? What is real in this life? Do we create our own reality? Is life really bad, or is it just a beautiful song we dance to?

The ""Dancer in the Dark"" in question is also the light from the projector dancing on the movie screen. The narrative here seems somewhat controversial, but it's nearly disposable. The story is an excuse for Von Trier to pay tribute to ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"", probably the best Danish film ever made. Selma's story is ultimately a tribute to the power of cinema.
Selma loves musicals (perhaps the most cinematic of all genres), and through her perseverance in her belief that ""nothing dreadful ever happens"" in a musical, she comes to be rewarded. Von Trier allows us to understand her plight & sympathize with her, but also creates a plot that's clearly meant to be seen as narrative construct (as opposed to a plausible chain of events). In the film, ""reality"" is shown via shaky handheld digital Dogma-esque camerawork, but the ""fantasy"" sequences use a color palette that makes them appear even more real than the ""real"" scenes. The wonderful acting convinces us that these characters are real, but at the same time, they are all played by characters that are cast against type making us ever aware of the artificiality of the film.  Furthermore, all of the characters voice their opinions on film musicals.
What von Trier's doing here is making us realize what Selma surely realizes. Although films are just films, they contain a very real ability to create an alternate reality filled with genuine emotion. While I personally find all this film theory exceptionally interesting, the great thing is that we can surely look at the film from a strictly melodramatic / musical perspective, and it still works quite well. Bjork's performance is absolutely incredible. It basically achieves its goal of being an equal to Falconetti's in ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"". The musical score is innovative, complex, and well integrated into the story.  The plot's got a great deal of emotional heft to it, but never descends into mindless sentimentalism.
Dancer in the Dark is the best film by a director that has several masterpieces under his belt already. It's the best film of its year (2000), and deserved the Palm D'Or it won at Cannes. It sums up the cinematic experience better than nearly any film, and could hold its place as the best film of the new millennium for quite some time.",999648000,10,2438,4.844124700239808
1279601,5,B00003CXKS,"No matter how you end the lymeric, once you see this movie you will think of Bjork in a different light. We all see the bizzare in Bjork; the photographer punching, the swan dress - she is always good for a ripple in the media without overt or tasteless tactics. Bjork's public persona is as unique as her professional one. As a performer and musician there is no one like her.  As a whole Bjork is about juxtiposition. The outsider from the icy edge of the earth who has the music world spinning on her axis. Extreeme? You tell me.  I hear Bjork-esque dittys playing as ""new sound"" 10 years after she records something.  As pop gets more and more media based - that gap closes - but Bjork is always first.
The facts of Bjork's carreer and persona are evedent in ""dancer"" only with scrutiny. Bjork approaches the character of Selma with such an unusual and yet perfect interpretation - just like Bjork's approach to everything else. You can not immagine any other way to do what Bjork does after she is finished with something - hell, even the swan dress - Bjork is Bjork.
In ""Dancer"" Bjork is Bjork come Merril Streep. That's right. The quirky girl from the land of fire and ice is an actress too. Bjork's preformance in ""Dancer"" is so riveting, so real, so thourough - you would think Bjork is moonlighting blind factory worker living in small town USA. (which explains the swan dress)
Bjork does not try to inject more than she is able into the roll. Bjork infuses every nuance with a crackle / an energy - something very electric - but no hoaky accent attempts or sad readings - she is the character - Bjork interprets the part with all of the complication and genius she draws up in the recording studio. If Bjork were not an international pop star - you might think she were some amazing character actress. You would be right - and like everything Bjork - to say she did something different and beautiful and startling and edgy and satisfying - would be a true statement - and like everything Bjork - she leaves you wanting more.
Bjork will not commit to any more acting.  Bjork is fleeting. See Bjork do what Cher approached and Maddona could never touch in their diva turned actress moments. If you were Moonstruck with Cher, you'll be vaporized by the meteor called Bjork.",997488000,,2281,4.5157384987893465
1279602,3,B00003CXKS,"Contrary to what you might hear from critics, who hailed and eviscerated ""Dancer in the Dark"" with equal gusto, Lars von Trier's musical melodrama has plenty to love-and plenty to hate.  It's not easy being on the fence with such a consistently polarizing film, but in this case, the fence is the only place to be.  Undercutting genuine pathos with unnecessary manipulation, ""Dancer in the Dark"" is hardly an outright success-but it bears the mark of a bold cinematic vision, even if said vision is given a rather misguided execution.
Selma Jezkova (Icelandic pop singer Bjrk) is a young Czech immigrant, slow-witted but warm and idealistic, who is painstakingly saving up for her son, Gene, to have an operation to reverse an inherited eye disease.  She herself is slowly going blind, which ultimately causes her to drop out of the lead role in an amateur production of ""The Sound of Music.""  Fortunately, Selma has her own musicals to take refuge in-lavish staged numbers, engineered from the sights and sounds of the factory where she works.  And as her eyesight worsens, she retreats further into these brief eruptions of her own vivid imagination, much to the chagrin of her best friend (played by none other than Catherine Deneuve).
Then something horrible happens-but of course, you expect it to.  The melodramatic signposts are there from the opening frame, and that isn't really a problem in and of itself, although ""Dancer in the Dark's"" detractors have been quick to point out how cheap and contrived it is.  They're missing the point.  Von Trier flaunts his cheap trickery, flaunts every contrivance; he never once asks the audience to accept the film as plausible.  To criticize it on those grounds, therefore, is too simplistic.
Unfortunately, ""Dancer in the Dark"" can also be faulted in the simplistic department.  In ""Breaking the Waves,"" von Trier guided another tortured female protagonist to undeserved tragedy; that film, though it had its problems, hinged upon deeper questions of spirituality, faith, and what God requires of man (or a woman, rather), and Bess, played by Emily Watson, had a God-given reason for subjecting herself to punishment.  ""Dancer's"" Selma has only the constrictions of the plot to justify her plunge into tragedy; she's an easy symbol, a paragon of virtue in a cruel and unjust world.  She does it all out of love for her son-but von Trier appears to be oblivious of the fact; after Gene's been introduced, we rarely see him again.  Ultimately, he's just a fulcrum for the film's plot machinery.
It's a testament to Bjrk's truly miraculous performance, however, that Selma, though she may be a mere pawn to von Trier, comes across as a beautifully realized and enormously sympathetic creature.  At times, von Trier's jittery hand-held camerawork becomes truly, unforgivably excessive-obtrusive, unnecessarily drawn-out closeups abound in the final scenes-but Bjrk, through the sheer intensity and abandon of her performance, makes them emotionally devastating all the same.  You know a film's doing something right when it relies so unabashedly on manipulation and manages to move you all the same.
As for the musical numbers-which are filmed in vivid colors and with steady cameras, to emphasize the contrast between the moldiness of reality and the fire of imagination-they're not as effective as they should be, for a simple reason that's held true for all musicals, classical or postmodern.  The songs aren't all that great.  Neither is the film's composition-the choreography is as sloppy as the ""Sound of Music"" rehearsal scenes, and von Trier's choice of angles and edits is startlingly inept.  Finally, on a sheer thematic level, Selma's musicals don't really give us much psychological insight-so she likes to sing, and she likes to dance with the world around her.  That's fine, but it's hardly compelling enough to hammer home as many times as ""Dancer in the Dark"" does.
The wonderful exception is ""I've Seen It All,"" a lovely, quavering tune that's as hummable as anything ever to come out of a movie musical.  That this song (which undeservedly lost the Oscar to more Academy-friendly Bob Dylan) emerged from this muddled juxtaposition of raw beauty and embarrassing missteps is, perhaps, enough of a good reason for ""Dancer in the Dark"" to exist.",996796800,9,4308,5.10099573257468
1279662,4,B00003CXKS,"The film received plaudits at Cannes and deservedly so. Not many films these days tackle so much with candor and integrity as Lars von Trier's films do. As a Dogma director, von Trier stubbornly wields a handheld and refuses cheesy soundtrack, but he inserts musical set scenes that are beautiful and fascinating to behold. It also gives Bjork a chance to let loose.
Bjork's performance is impressive to say the least. She puts her shrill idiosyncrasies as a music perhormer on hold, and gives a measured, pitch-perfect performance as a woman who is losing her vision, her life and her grip on the reality.
Lars von Trier likes to tackle big, metaphysical themes, and he's most adept at blurring the line between reality and the metaphysical realm. He was more expressionistic in his earlier post-modern flicks such as 'Zentropa'. But with his allegiance to Dogma, he has cut down on the lavishly produced qualities. The sister film of 'Dancer...' is the film that preceded it: the excellent 'Breaking the Waves,' which also deals with a downfall of a good, pure-hearted woman.
However, whereas 'Breaking the Waves' weaved the Christ metaphor onto the story of its heroine effortlessly, in 'Dancer in the Dark', the mechanisms of the storytelling become conscious entities, and seem like artifice that intrude upon the arc of the story. The musical numbers, as beautiful and exuberant as they are, take us out of the realm of Selma's world too suddenly. Not enough subtlety.
It is worth mentioning the stories that von Trier tell are emphatically melodramatic in nature. In this film, a blind mother tries to save her son, but through injustice of the world, faces death herself. It is a testament to Mr. von Trier's craftsmanship that this story, which can turn into a ball of kitsch in the hands of a lesser man, is told without a trace of sentimentality. It's a haunting film that won't leave you unaffected.",996624000,3,1911,4.901234567901234

This movie is not a feel-good, and it often left me in tears, but the whole experience is so spectacular. The acting by Catherine Denueve and Bjork is powerful and incredible; Bjork gives an amazing performance especially, because this is her feature film debut. The ending to ""Dancer In The Dark"" is upsetting and depressing, but it is just such a great movie, don't miss it!  Along with the movie, there is a soundtrack that is also worth crediting.

1279664,5,B00003CXKS,"Many of the reviews I read dealt with the process of the making of the film, and the fine performance and music of Bjork, but few seemed to reflect on some of the major issue of this movie. As in Dubus' recent novel, ""The House of Sand and Fog"", it is a story of the tortuous journey of immigrants pursuing what Ameican has to offer. Unfortunately, in Dancer, Selma encounters many negative aspects of what America offers: monetary greed, betrayal, poverty, the enormous sacrifices made in order to pay for medical care, and legal malfunctions. Selma pays the ultimate price for her misplaced but steadfast belief in her dream for her family. Her concept of the wonders of America was apparantly born in the country of her birth, through the movie-musicals she saw there. She was able to hold onto her courage and her beliefs by entering musicals via her imagination, particularly when she experienced overwhelming pain in her life.
While Selma is portrayed as what we might see as simple, I think it was her singlemindedness and her trust in what she was trying to accomplish for her son that we might interpret as ""simple"". She could not be persuaded, sidetracked or manipulated into being anyone other than herself; her trust in her purpose became her downfall.
Few reviewers mentioned the last half hour or so of the film which could be construed as a ""poster-film"" for the anti-death penalty movement. Many reviewers, both male and female, openly stated that they cried and cried at the end of the film. Why? What did the film's end touch off in so many of us?
Clearly, Selma was not competently represented in court (in the court scene, her attorney says nothing, challenges no one, and reminds us of all the recent publicity of disinterested court-appointed defense counsels emplyed in capital cases). She was either not urged to defend herself or she did not want to. Selma was convicted and sentanced without the true facts of the murder being exposed. E.g.: When Bill's wife says that her husband begged for mercy, no one questions her interpretataion of what she heard, but did not see.
This is a very complicated film. It is both fresh and inovative and is one of the most remarkable films I have seen in a long time. Whether you like it or not, the film will stay with you and challenge you both emotionally and intellectually.",995155200,4,2340,4.737745098039215

1279666,5,B00003CXKS,"The last movie I watched was absolutely the saddest movie I've ever seen in my entire life.  Even being the testosterone-filled tough guy that I am, I teared up.  It was none other than Lars von Trier's ""Dancer in the Dark"" staring Icelandic chanteuse Bjrk.  I mostly wanted to see it because of Bjrk, and anyone who has heard her voice can relate.  I've also heard great things about other work Lars has done, so I thought that this would be an enjoyable film.
I was drawn into the film slowly, as the viewer is simply dropped into the middle of things.  I caught up quickly and was hooked.  This film can best be described as a train wreck.  It's so tragic that one doesn't feel they can watch any more, and yet one cannot peel their eyes off of the screen.  Selma was definitely a tragic hero, and many fine tragic elements were included.  Different styles are used than Shakespearian tragedies, but I think that even the Bard himself would be impressed.
People mostly don't know what to say when asked what they think of the movie.  They agree that it's not a bad movie at all, but in a movie where the only enjoyable parts are the musical fantasies Selma delves into and the rest being heart-breakingly painful, it's not a happy film.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who can handle the dark nature of this movie.  One great aspect of this movie is that I'm still thinking about it days later.  The film sticks with you.

1279667,5,B00003CXKS,"When I say 'modern audience', I don't mean the pop culture audience; the audiences who are able to change good ideas into pointless overkill (e.g. ""Scream""). In ""Dancer In The Dark's"" case, the Palme D'Or winning musical from Lars von Trier that promptly sank without trace at the box office, I mean those who appreciate when a filmmaker decides to take a familiar genre and make a film that, whilst exhibiting a certain knowledge of its conventions, gives it a refreshing spin. And ""Dancer In The Dark"" is one of these films: a unique wedding of melodrama and musical follies.
Lars von Trier's collaboration with dance director Vincent Paterson and music genius/goat (whatever you prefer) Bjork brings forth something no big film studio would immediately jump onboard to. As well as Trier's token drama, with added dashes of gentle comedy swiftly diminished by horrific violence, Trier's rugged camerawork in the 'reality' scenes (which rarely resort to ""Blair Witch""-style blurriness) adds a documentary feel to the piece, aided by a wonderful performance from Bjork, some cast-breaking flourishes from Catherine Deneuve, Siobhan Fallon and David Morse and a showstopper from Joel Grey. The musical sequences, like many of Bjork's own promos, are beautifully filmed with enriched colour, as well as being thematically rich (see ""I've Seen It All"" and the unsettling ""Smith & Wesson"") and downright danceworthy (""In The Musicals Part 2"", quietly spectacular in a way only Trier could have done it).

1279716,2,B00003CXKS,"Lars von Trier filmed 'Dancer in the Dark' in the intriguing tradition of the Dogma School - a group of young, mostly European filmmakers intensely commited to realism. The distinctive style they achieve relies heavily on two techniques: firstly, the Dogma directors emphasize stripped-down cinematography (hand-held cameras, natural or unembellished lighting); secondly, Trier and his colleagues encourage their actors towards highly understated dialogue, heavy on improvisation. The result is remarkable, and 'Dancer in the Dark' remains a fine example of Dogma filmmaking. I write this to illustrate that my beef with 'Dancer' does not stem from Trier's sense of style or format (many other negative reviewers have complained about the film's cinematography and jumbled speech).
Nor am I bothered by Bjork's musical intergections. The surrealist song and dance vingettes take a moment to adjust to, and though not all of them work, even the lousiests sequences are bold and at least a little clever. Selma's funky daydreaming forms the heart and soul of 'Dancer,' and the stylistic contrast between the song and non-song episodes is jarring and inspired.
All told, I think 'Dancer in the Dark' is well concieved and follows a highly unique formula for which Trier and his talented cast deserve much praise.
There is, however, more to a great or even good movie than high-concept, no matter how high or how clever, or even how beautiful. 'Dancer in the Dark' shoots itself in the foot with a very high caliber weapon very near the aproximate point in the film when all should have been drawn to a close. There is a very well-rendered story which unfolds for just short of the initial 2 hours, full of extreme human interest and emotional tension. Will Selma be taken advantage of? Will she go completely blind? Will she find her way home every day without being flattened by a freight train? One waits in agony for her to have her arms crushed in a press or at least drop her (useless) glasses into a machine. Her financial crusade is naive and sweet. Selma's daily life is rich and, though full of color, believable.
Why Lars von Trier felt the need to truncate this energy by resorting to a maddeningly predictable, tediously linear final third is the real intruige of 'Dancer in the Dark'. The film is absoultely derailed by a sensational plot device I would contend, in contradiction to my fellow reviewers, is anything but fresh and naturalistic. The microscope we view Selma under for so long is taken away, and Trier whisks us through time lapses and strung-together episodes culminating in a melodramatic finale sequence which comes as no surprise at all. Selma's fate, barreling down the road, highbeams on, is a dramatic turkey, gratuitous, self-absorbed, predictable.
Why does 'Dancer' hara-kiri itself? Why didn't someone at Trier's side suggest, after, say, the arrest scene - ""hey Lars, this is kind of nice what we've got here. How bout we not over-indulge?"" And why does no one else seem to care?",991612800,9,3014,5.017964071856287

They both have a very ""authentic"" feel, but the pacing of the movie is slow and jerky. The movie plot itself moves at a decent pace but the individual scenes felt like they needed an editor. But what's worse is that you can't get into that flow of the movie because the ""musical"" scenes come in at such a different pace it's jarring. Then there's the touching main character. Selma is your ""die on the cross to help her child"" kind of mother, but one who makes choices in the movie that are so stupid it give the movie a fake feeling.

I had heard all sorts of things about its style and how Bjork said she'd never do another movie after this one, so I figured there must be something to it.  I was not disappointed.  First off, this film is a musical.  A very modern day musical.  Lars von Trier was able to shoot the musical pieces using 100 digital video cameras placed around the set at one time.  This is mind boggling.  His idea was to do the number once and just capture it that way, but it didn't work out to well and they had to do mulitple takes.  But just appreciating the idea behind this portion of the film must spark your interest for the dramatic portions of it.  Bjork is amazing.  I would like to see her do more films, but I know it probably won't happen, sadly enough.

With this incridible movie, you must give it your full attention, as if you were listening to one of Bjork's CD's.  And, if you didn't cry at the end of this movie, you definetly need to check your pulse.  Bjork not only played the part of Selma--she became Selma, and that's what astounds me.  She put her heart and soul into becoming this character, and it shined throughout the movie.  This movie was more than a mother giving all she has to save her son--it was a trip in the mind of a person with a heart of gold.  I highly, highly recommend this movie.  You will never see anything like it again--I can promise you that.",991008000,,801,4.445205479452055
1279807,5,B00003CXKS,"2000 was a very dull year for film but ""Dancer In The Dark"" made it worth it. First let me start by saying two things to prove that this won't be a biased review; 1. I hate most musicals(I can stand a few like ""Cabaret"") 2. I like Bjork but I'm not a big fan. I don't want to touch too much on the plot because I had no clue what the film was about when I went to see it and I'm glad I did. The themes in the film are many, touching on everything from single mothering and the death penalty. The style of the film overall reminds me of Bertolt Brecht's plays. Most of the characters are very alienated and the singing and dancing are always upbeat on a dismal subject and aren't sung to sound pretty and clear. The last number in the film with in context of what was going on is the most Brechtian scene I've seen outside Brecht and Churchill's Mad Forest play. The story is very tragic but I wasn't crying at the end. It's the same technique Brecht was trying to use in his plays. The film doesn't indulge in being too avant garde and arty, it keeps a perfect balance of creativity and straight forwardness. I won't say too much more because I want you to fully experience this film without knowing too much. My choice for best film of 2000.",991008000,,1242,4.157676348547718
1279808,5,B00003CXKS,"This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen! Bjork gives a wonderful performance, as does Catherine Deneuve and David Morse.

1279809,3,B00003CXKS,"Musicals often irritate me. I'm not sure why, but I have a difficult time suspending my disbelief and accepting the random singing and dancing--I know it's not meant to be realistic, but I can't even consider it fantastic.
That said, the musical interludes in this film make the movie. Without them the movie is nothing more than your average--though well-performed--parent sacrificing for their child story,  reminiscent of some Law and Order episodes I've seen. Von Trier's visual style would still carry the movie to viewability, but there really wouldn't be anything worth remembering. The acting, as I said, is quite remarkable, especially Bjork's and Morse's performances. The characters are believable and developed--Bjork the seemingly frigid and controlling mother who is, at heart, always thinking about her child--what's best for him, etc and Morse the once rich, now poor man who can't deal with his sudden debt, and is afraid that those close to him won't accept it either. The editing and directing are good--it's refreshing to see a filmmaker not only shy away from many film conventions, but openly disregard them (namely, von trier enjoys employing jump cuts, quick shot scale changes, abandons the rule of thirds quite frequently and offers skaking hand held cameras over pedastaled still ones). furthermore, he doesn't block or script the actor's movements (hence, the hand held cameras), which allows the performances to appear more natural and fluid than most hollywood productions. the cinematography is fine, and sets are built with precision. but without the musical interludes, Dancer In the Dark doesn't offer anything new (except von trier's directing--which of course is not new anymore, inasmuch as this is not his first movie). That is to say, you've seen all of this before. you know the characters, are familiar with the plot and will probably know how the movie's going to develop and eventually end within the first half hour.
still the movie is made memorable by selma's musical fantasies. first off, neither the lyrics nor the music match traditional musical films. bjork's tunes are poppy, and von trier's lyrics are downright nerve-chilling. not only that, but the musical fantasies aren't forced as in some other films--they come only when they belong, only when they can further the story and/or the character. two or three of them should cause uncomfortable moments for the viewer, at least one should promote rivers of tears. finally, the style with which the musical bits are filmed is so original and compelling that the movie becomes something terribly important. the dvd includes a documentary on this style, so i won't ruin it for those of you that wish to buy or rent it. let me just say that through von trier's innovation the musical moments were filmed only once.
as for the dvd:  it's definitely a good buy. the commentary is adequete, the documentaries informative, picture and sound quality both good.
as a final note, stellan skarsgaard appears in an unbilled cameo.",990403200,,3021,5.138211382113822
1279810,5,B00003CXKS,"I found this movie entertaining, depressing, and intriguing.  Bjork has never been one of my favorite entertainers, but I definitely give her acting & musical kudos for Dancer In The Dark.  As a poor immigrant with a hereditary disease that leads to blindness, she's faced with many conflicts...yet, she can still escape into the magical world of musical make believe.  These scenes, which blend the aura of classic musical cinema with her obscure singing style, are almost surreal to the viewer.  I was blown away.  There are glimpses of hope and happiness in the multi-faceted story, but it does not end on a happy note...and may leave many viewers with an bad taste in their mouth.  I've read a few reviews that stated that it had a strong anti-American sentiment, but I disagree with them.

1279812,4,B00003CXKS,"I saw this movie in the theatre and was riveted.  It is somewhat manipulative but I didn't find it distractingly so, and I purchased the DVD on the day it was released.  There a lot of reviews here that discuss the movie, so I'll discuss the DVD.
I had read a rumor on the internet that Bjork was not featured in the behind-the-scenes footage because of fights with the director.  While I don't know the reason, it is true that Bjork is woefully underfeatured in the bonus material.  The lack of bonus material with the main star of the film unfortunately is not unique to this DVD, the focus mainly being on the director with occasional producers or writers thrown in.  Nonetheless, the lack of a ""star feature"" particularly disappointed me on this DVD because I'm a fan of Bjork and thought she turned in a powerhouse performance and would like to have heard more about it.  It's pretty unique to have the composer of a film's main songs to also star in the movie...if nothing else, doesn't that merit some kind of feature even if just her acting or regular Bjorkness did not?  They didn't include anything like that, and that is why I've rated the movie 4 stars instead of 5.
With that said, one of the bonus features on this disc immediately ranks as one of the most interesting and enjoyable bonus features I've seen on a DVD.  It makes me cheer for the DVD format and its ability to include bonus material in general and to cheer the New Line Platium Series DVDs in particular.  The choreographer edited footage of original in-studio rehearsals with alternate takes and final cuts of the dance numbers.  This was very well done and extremely enjoyable and informative to watch, even if you aren't a fan of the movie.  I know next to nothing about this process and it was great to see the process in action.  If you didn't like the film I can't say that this feature alone is compelling enough to make the purchase, but I really did find it to be spectacular.
In somewhat of a contrast, the feature on the 100 camera footage was was quite cheesy, but still enjoyable.  It is definitely not at the level of the choreography feature, but I was glad to see it. I was also happy to see the menu that lets you jump right to Selma's pieces.  My young son was interested in what I was doing and with that handy menu I pulled up the factory and courtroom musical numbers and he loved them.",990230400,5,2386,4.442660550458716
1279813,2,B00003CXKS,"If it wasn't for the fact that the Beatiful and exceptionally talented Bjork was in this movie I probably would have turned it off after the first 20 minutes. As it was, I could only stand to watch about 45minutes before i had to leave the room. What I want to know is why Bjork? She is so cute and makes her own paper clothing, and makes really dope music.
This movie is tortuous and dark (as the title alludes to) and painfully drawn out. I think that if I ever find the guy that wrote and directed it I would have to kick him in the shins and ask for my rental fee back.
I love Bjork, but could not recommend this movie to anyone that I wanted to keep as a friend. Don't see this movie. Don't pander to this type of childish, trying to be too cool drudgery. It's not just that the story was painfull and sad, but I felt that it was formulaicly designed to be irritating and I have no time in my life for that.",990144000,4,912,4.016483516483516

1279865,3,B00003CXKS,"I have to admit that after a first puzzled reaction I was intrigued if not particularly excited by the unusual -- well, actually, bizarre -- film experience that is ""Dancer in the Dark"". I was not famaliar with the director Lars von Trier nor with his star Bjrk. As for von Trier, evidently he has delivered to the motion picture establishment , with his Dogma 95, a manifesto of the New Cinema, a rejection of the slick conventions offered at the Cineplex. With a hand-held camera and cinma vrit handling of locations and actors, he's doing basically what the Nouvelle Vague was doing forty years ago. There are limitations. The camera work becomes too self-consciously unsteady,and von Trier does not have a light touch with actors. Bjrk, for instance. Bjrk, it turns out, is a plain, somewhat mannered woman who has a fanatical following due to her soulful new-age singing, complete with deliberate cracks and wobbles. In this film, her second, she is playing Selma, a Czechoslovakian immigrant who is going blind and who, after being betrayed and vicitimized, is put on trial for murder. The story is set in Washington State in the early 1960's, though it doesn't seem particularly American. (Another reviewer has wondered how, in the boondocks, a revival movie house can stay open on three customers per night.) Selma is suppose to be rehearsing an amateur production of ""The Sound of Music"", in which she has the role of Maria. These rehearsals, clueless and almost competely devoid of children, seem arbitrary and interminable. Musicals are Selma's passion, and whenever life becomes too tense, she reverts to a dream world where her surroundings are transformed into simplistic song-and-dance routines that look like MTV. (Bjrk is credited with writing the songs.) Selma says she loves musicals because nothing dreadful ever happens in them, which tells me she doesn't know her Rodgers and Hammerstein: young men get killed in ""Carousel"", ""South Pacific"", and ""The King and I"". At any rate, Bjrk has a peculiar talent suitable for supporting this type of entertainment, and she gets help from David Morse as a neurotic cop and Peter Storemare (usually a villain) as Selma's sweet-natured dopey suitor. Catherine Deneuve (who seems to have a thing for off-beat screenplays) plays a protective friend of Selma's; and Joel Grey is agile and dapper in a small but important role -- nearly 50 years after he made his film debut in ""About Face"", an awful Warners musical. ""Dancer in the Dark"" is long, nearly two and a half hours, which is quite a stretch for misty-eyed surrealism, but I was drawn enough by von Trier's style to try one of his other films in the future.",989971200,,2673,4.929046563192904
1279866,4,B00003CXKS,"I thought this film was very well done. The hand-held camera worked for the material, making it appear like a home movie. Bjork did an excellent job playing Selma, and the supporting cast was also very good. The song and dance numbers ranged from mildly interesting to emotionally wrenching. I don't think I've seen ""Favorite Things"" done any better.  The film definitely had its intended effect of leaving you emotionally drained at the end, but after reflecting on it, it seemed just an exercise in filmmaking technique than something that will stick with me. There just isn't much to think about here. Still, it was a powerful experience and worth the time.",989452800,3,660,4.892857142857143
1279867,5,B00003CXKS,"To me, movies are about entertainment. I happen to be entertained by a good story, good directing and good acting as opposed to how many things can be blow'd-up in under two hours, so there are a number of movies I have liked that didn't make it big at the USA box-office. But I liked even the best of those movies as entertainment, just entertainment.
While Dancer in the Dark is immensely entertaining it is not just entertainment. It is art so good it should be hung next to the Mona Lisa in the Louvre. I have read many of the Amazon.com reviews, as well as others. Most agree that Bjork should have won an Oscar. I certainly agree with this. Many reviewers, however, did not appreciate the bold directing, the gritty camera work, the editing. The movie wouldn't have been possible without the directing being just as it was. Bjork's acting would have been wasted in a vehicle that was simply the story we start with. It was the directing, the cinematic technique in toto, that took this story and made it something that was big enough for Bjork's talent to fill. I will even go so far as to say that while there might be another actress who could have played Bjork's part, there is not another cinematic team who could have provided this vehicle. Having said this, one should appreciate what Bjork brought to the totality of the movie in addition to her acting the role of Selma. But make no mistake, this movie belongs equally to Lars von Trier and I'm not at all sure he's gotten the respect he deserves.
I don't think I own a single video outside of something taped off the TV to be viewed at a later time. What's the point? But I will buy this one and I will feel privileged to have it.",989193600,5,1695,4.401273885350318

It seems at first to take a while to get going, but all the little seemingly innocuous things that happen at the begining loom large at the end (which was the most harrowing film climax in many years). What really makes this movie is both the music and the acting of Bjork. If they were to have simple hired an actress, the film would not have worked. Bjork, however, didn't act the part. You can see that she actually FELT everything the charachter did. She didn't play Selma, she was Selma. This is the best DVD to be released so far this year. I also recommend getting the CD soundtrack ""Selmasongs"". The music is incredibly beautiful.

1279871,2,B00003CXKS,"This review is obviously a negative one, the elements of the movie that were well done, and there were many, had no impact on me because the creators of this film seemed to have no concern as to whether anything in it was believable. Musicals need not be realistic, and the musical elements are good, but this movie is not really a musical, the musical elements are only internal fantasies of the heroine. The movie is a drama and it tries almost constantly and relententlessly to pull our emotinal cords but it is pushing on a string since it makes no effort to create any element of reality. I am not saying it fails in its attempt but rather makes no attempt.
Obviously some reviewers were moved emotionally but it seems rather split. So the key suggestion I can make in this review is do not consider buying this movie, rent it and then decide. Since most customers of Amazon are primarily considering a purchase this should be the key feature of all reviews.
If you do rent, rent the DVD. For if you fall into the non-believer camp the commentary by the director is comical. Matter of fact if you can't make it through the movie definitely switch to the commentary I found it a ""giggle"".

It is not often that a movie really jolts you.  I mean REALLY truly leaves you gutted.  This one does.  Lars Von Trier also manages to reinvent the musical.  I don't want to give away tons of details, the film speaks for itself.  I will say that it is CRIMINAL that Bjork's performance and this film was virtually ignored by the United States.

It was the editing and camera technique that prevented me from giving 5 stars.

It was brilliant to transform Selma's antagonists into smiling, singing dancers during the musical numbers.

1279925,5,B00003CXKS,"Altruism, benevolence, a mother's love for her son and pure, unadulterated evil are the key elements in one of the most dynamic and emotionally charged (as well as overlooked) films of the year (2000), ""Dancer In the Dark,"" directed by Lars von Trier.  Icelandic singer Bjork stars as Selma Yeskova, a single mother living in a small town in Washington State, who works in a factory to support herself and her ten-year-old son, Gene (Vladan Kostic).  Selma works her fingers to the bone, taking double shifts and doing whatever she can to save enough money for an operation Gene will need when he turns thirteen to correct an inherited, genetic condition that will eventually rob him of his sight.  And Selma knows only too well the effects of the disorder; even as she works towards accruing the sum needed for the operation, she is coping with the onset of her own imminent blindness.  Besides her son, her one passion in life is movie musicals, which she has loved since she was a little girl; she grew up with them, and now it is to them that she turns in her mind when life closes in on her and threatens to become unbearable.  When she is overwhelmed and overburdened, she hears music in the sounds of the factory and finds rhythm in the work.  In the musicals she finds the respite from concern she needs to carry on, escaping to a place where ""nothing dreadful ever happens.""
 Set in 1964 against a backdrop of the beautiful rural Pacific Northwest, the content of von Trier's film is so real and it is so visually engrossing that at times it's like watching a home video.  And it makes you more than merely an observer of Selma's life; you become involved.  You share the joy of a mother watching her son ride his first bicycle; you sense the ""community"" of her friends and co-workers who help make her life bearable.  Von Trier successfully manages to avoid any maudlin sentimentality, and instead tells the story in a voice that is straightforward and creates an intense, emotionally complex and memorable film that ultimately takes you to a place that, in the beginning, you would never have dreamed possible.  In a way, it all sneaks up on you, until suddenly you find yourself caught up and swept away in an emotional torrent.
 Discovering a great film is always exciting (and without question this is one), but when it includes an astounding new talent, as well, it is indeed a thrill.  And such is the case here.  For as Selma, Bjork quite simply gives one of the best performances of the year, and how she got passed over for an Oscar nomination is beyond me.  A gifted individual, she brings subtle nuance to the character, and conveys a humanity of singular depth that makes Selma, and the fact that she is so adamant in her undertaking, more than real and believable.  That the viewer is able to be drawn in and affected on such a personal level with this film is a direct result of Bjork's natural ability as an actress.  Granted, von Trier led the way, and her co-stars (especially David Morse, in a terrific performance as her friend, Bill) provided invaluable support, but the real connection this film makes with audience is through-- and because of-- Bjork.
 The supporting cast includes Catherine Deneuve (Kathy), Peter Stormare (Jeff), Udo Kier (Dr. Porkorny), Joel Grey (Oldrich Novy), Vincent Paterson (Samuel), Cara Seymour (Linda) and Stellan Skarsgard (Doctor).  Much of the strength of von Trier's film lies in the implied, as well as the overt aspects of it, and in the end, ""Dancer In the Dark"" will leave you with many things to ponder for some time to come, especially concerning those ""gray areas"" of the human condition.  Rationale, motivation, the distorted priorities to which it seems so many people are prone, as well as proof of the existence of true goodness that many do, in fact, carry in their hearts.  Emotionally devastating, this is a film that demands reflection.  Unfortunately, it raises many questions to which--just as in real life-- there are simply no real answers.",987292800,3,4024,4.734957020057307
1279926,5,B00003CXKS,"When I first heard that Bjrk was making a movie, I began counting down the days until it came out on video.  All I had heard was that the movie was ""beautiful"" and ""disturbing"", and they were right all the way.
Bjrk does a commanding, ethereal, and yet startingly human performance in her role of Selma, and her supporting actors and actresses are equally as good.  I was particularly stirred by Selma's reactions to her trials and hardships, to which anyone, especially mothers, can relate:  she was not overly strong, only did what she had to, and struggled to do the rest.
Many people have complained about the camera use in the movie, and these are probably the same people who complained about the cameras in The Blair Witch Project.  I see the rough simplicity as necessary, and the Technicolor musical numbers worked very effectively, though as the movie went on they became sadder and more pathetic.
This film is generally flawless, and I found nothing I disliked.  It is painful and heartbreaking to watch, but I have been haunted by it ever since, and upon even listening to the soundtrack I am again brought to tears.

1279927,5,B00003CXKS,"This movie..almost like a documentary...takes you into the life of Selma, played by the wonderful almost childlike actress Bjork. Who really took me into this world. I loved everything..every single detail, every camera angle, and the musical. Sure it is a heart breaking film, but it is powerful and funny in the beginning.
Without a doubt this movie ranks up at the top with American Beauty.
Beautiful. Bjork you should have won the oscar, but I'm glad she will go back in music. She has the best female voice and is ahead of our time.",987206400,5,537,4.663157894736842
1279928,5,B00003CXKS,"I admit it, this is by far the saddest movie I have ever seen, and a level of saddness I never felt possible before seing it.  Anyone who could complain about such things as a wobbly camera and bleached-out color are clearly missing the point, and focusing far to closely on a small detail of a masterpiece.  The movie focuses on the harshness of extreme realism.  Life is not brushed up with cinematographic sequences, it does not have a clever score, and it certainly does not have a steady camera and viewpoint to record it all.  But life is beautiful all the same.
Life is beautiful because without it there is no art, no musicals.  The musical sequences are the romantic idealistic break from and fuel for life itself.  Only by contrasting the steady, bright, livid musical scenes with the documentary-like remainder of the movie is the full extent of both realized.  Its hard to explain how it works but it just does.  The movie is not badly edited, as can be seen from the musical scenes that any such ""bad cuts"" were intentional.
The characterization of Selma and her downfall were perfectly done.  Selma is not a genius, she gives the few gifts she has willingly to all who ask for them, but she continues to work hard and never complains.  She is child-like in some ways, but very experienced in others.  Before her part, I never really believed that an actor could contribute to a film, that someone else could do just as good a job, but Bjork is amazing.  Her music is not as catchy as some, but it is hypnotizing.  Bjork is smiling happily one minute, crying the next, but through most of the movie cheerful and giving through the worst events possible.  Bjork IS Selma.  All the supporting characters are good too.
In conclusion this is a really good movie.  If you don't like sad things, you won't like this, but if you can handle it you really should see this movie.  It should have been much better recognized at the Oscars, and it really sucks that it only got like one nomination.  From now on I'm paying more attention to both Lars von Trier and the Cannes Film Festival!",987120000,2,2091,4.530666666666667
1279929,5,B00003CXKS,"The world Selma lives in is sad and depressing.  Her eye sight is slowly disappearing and her world is growing dark.  The film reflects this by looking very dull, except of course when Selma (played by Bjork) is daydreaming her a life she couldn't have, one in a musical.  Throughout the film, she is forced to give up everything because of her fleeding sight, and the people who wish to take advantage of her.
I really think I need to buy this movie after I rented it last night.  I really cant get the utter beauty of the film out of my head.  Its quite artsy and has a lot of hidden meaning, so beware of that before you sit down to watch all 2 1/2 hours of it.
Overall, it may be the best movie Ive seen all year.",986860800,3,717,4.0928571428571425
1279930,5,B00003CXKS,"First of all, I can't even believe this film was made and distributed to so many theaters. Don't get me wrong-- I think it may be one of the best movies I have ever seen, but it is SO much different than anything else I can hardly believe someone picked it up to produce and distribute.
The movie doesn't know if it is a documentary, drama or musical, but somehow it pulls off being all three. The story is that of a Czech immigrant who works and exists only to pay for a surgery to correct in her son a genetic disease that will eventually render him blind. The acting in the entire film is flawless and it is cast perfectly. The camera angles and visuals were stunning and the soundtrack (by Bjork) is enchanting.
I must disagree with other reviewers on a couple of points. The first being that this is a ""predictable story"" of a character ""too weak-willed to defend herself from the forces of 'darkness' enveloping her miserable life"". The will of Selma is incredible. Out of guilt from bringing her son into the world, knowing he will inherit the same blinding disease she has, and pure love Selma dedicates her life to saving money to pay for the surgery. She sacrifices everything save occasional viewings of musicals which provide her the sanity she needs to continue. Even when put to the ultimate test- death- she continues. The second point is that there are no happy scenes. Completely false. The sheer beauty of Selma's mission and the musicals she produces in her head define love and happiness respectively. The end of the movie (I won't spoil it for you) is sad but at the same time happy in that Bjork has found her piece after being wronged in so many ways.
The first 20 minutes are painfuly slow, but everything comes together. Wouldn't recommend it to everyone, but if you are a fan of ""art"" films or Indies, definately watch it.",986860800,71,1848,4.5359281437125745
1279931,4,B00003CXKS,"Starring Bjork, who also happens to be a pop star in her own country of Iceland, this disturbing and sad video released just last year, should have won more awards than it did.  Written and directed by Lars Von Trier, from Denmark, it is a creative departure from anything Hollywood has ever seen. It's shot with hand held cameras in natural light and the story is itself an overblown melodrama.
Bjork is cast as a simpleminded Czech immigrant who has come to the United States to earn enough money to save money for an operation for her young son to prevent him from the inherited blindness that is fast taking over her life.  She also is rehearsing in a drama club's production of The Sound of Music and is totally enamoured with Hollywood musicals.  Her acting is outstanding, and she wins the hearts of the audience.  That's why it is so painful to watch the awful things that happen to her over and over again and finally result in an ultimate tragic end.
The film, however, is not just about her predicament.  It is also about the American dream and Hollywood musicals.  Throughout the movie, and often in the middle of the saddest parts, the light shifts and everyone breaks into song and dance.  I know that the director was trying to make an artistic statement here, but it didn't work for me.  I was annoyed at these parts and bored by the musical interlude.  And the jarring effect of the inappropriateness of these musical numbers made the film even more depressing for me.
At 140 minutes the film was too long although it held my interest throughout.  I was constantly saddened and found myself weeping at the end. And so even though I can see this was a fine video, I can recommend it only those film aficionados who are intrigued by the concept.  But be prepared to find yourself depressed and shaken at the end.",986774400,6,1827,4.556574923547401
1279932,5,B00003CXKS,"Don't listen to any reviewers of this film, good or bad (I'm aware of the irony). It's a film you most definately have to explore and understand for yourself. Most of the lower-scoring reviewers obviously either didn't understand the movie, or couldn't see through the melancholy overtones that are actually an integral part of the story.
Regarding the 'low-film quality', what this is, is streight DV footage, which hasn't had a film-grain effect applied over the top to give that 'hollywood polish'. Also the camera feels like it is being held by a reporter. These scenes are the 'reality' scenes, and are PURPOSEFULLY shot that way, to convey a sense of the film being 'immediate'. When the 'musical' scenes begin, the colors brighten, a professional camera is used and the screen has that dynamic look to it.
I guess when things aren't spelled out with special effects and cheesy dialogue a film will always have to deal with the people it was never meant to reach. So, to those who won't ever understand movies like this one, the movie is not negative. Sad things happen but Selmas life is a musical, she is a positive centre in an impossible world.",986774400,2,1154,4.775

The more I thought about the awful direction though the more I disliked the film.  I bought the DVD just to add to more Bjork video collection but I doubt I will suffer through this film one more time.  The camera work I guess was supposed to be life like and give the actors room but to me it was a headache and a cop out.  When camera work becomes so noticable that it is a camera bobing up and down, it is no longer lending a life like quality to the film.  Perhaps I missed the point.  Anyway... this film is generally a love it or hate it affair.  I am in the middle.",986774400,2,693,4.007299270072993
1280010,5,B00003CXKS,"Dancer in the Dark is a film that stays with you. It has some extraordinary performances which are utterly believable because they are so naturalistic. This is the merit of Von Trier's method of direction. He seems to have allowed the actors a kind of freedom to find their performance. It is as if the whole film is improvised, giving it an immediacy and directness which is quite uncommon. Moreover, the gritty style of the dramatic portions of the film, looking as they do like a documentary, contrast wonderfully with the fantasy musical sequences. Suddenly everything becomes brighter, the colour changes and Bjrk's strange haunting music begins.
This film is like no other I have ever seen. Technically it must be classed as a musical, but it is unlike any of the musicals which Bjrk's character loves so much. It is almost as if Von Trier has created a new genre. There have been dramatic musicals before, of course, but the drama was of a different kind. The drama of, for example, West Side Story or South Pacific is theatrical and stylised. Dancer in the Dark is dramatically realistic and in the end this makes it all the more shattering.
If the viewer is willing to go along with this film, willing to be swept up into its world, the result can be very powerful. I found myself to be emotionally drained and not a little disturbed by the whole experience. This is a measure of the rare quality of the film. It touches the viewer and evokes feeling which remain.
It is possible to make one or two minor criticisms. There are far two many Europeans in the cast of a film set in America. Von Trier no doubt wished to use familiar actors, those who had appeared in his other films, but it rather counts against the films authenticity as a portrayal of the United States. Furthermore, Bjrk's accent means that it is at times hard to believe that she is from Czechoslovakia. Granted she sounds foreign, but her voice is a mixture of Iceland and London. She does not sound remotely Slavic.
However, these quibbles can be quickly forgotten, for Dancer in the Dark is a film which once seen can never be forgotten.",986774400,2,2117,4.618037135278515
1280011,4,B00003CXKS,"There is one thing that even the most jaded viewer must admit about Dancer in the Dark; Bjork's performance was outstanding. She puts her heart and soul into every moment of this film. She is a singer not a trained actor and she certainly doesn't have a movie stars looks but in a movie like this that is all for the best. What she lacks in technical craftmanship she more than makes up for in spirit.

When the man who loves her discovers that she is nearly blind she sings ""I Really Don't Care""; a powerful paen in which she tells us that she has seen everything she wants and has no regrets even though all around her the world is turning black-- she is content to simply dance in the dark, she has found joy. I watched the film today on video for the first time and I must have replayed that scene a dozen times it is a moment of sheer Platonic Beauty. Unfortunately, right after that the movie, for me at least, falls apart.

The next sequence of scenes, while amazingly well acted and directed-- particularly the death scene-- are so illogical and absurd on so many levels that I lost my ""suspension of disbelief"", without which the magical meditation of cinema cannot produce transcendence. So close and yet.

The film also would benifit from a judicious cut or two it seems at least 20 minutes too long.

This could have been a great film a true masterpiece. Even so it is well worth watching particularly for old souls with an open mind and a taste for symbolic films that are off the beaten path.",986688000,3,1506,4.406474820143885

1280013,4,B00003CXKS,"This movie has legendarily split audiences in half, between intense hate and intense love. Give credit to Lars Von Trier for provoking such strong conviction in people; that proves he's doing something right.
It's a given that I'd see this movie since I'm a Bjork fan, but even without Bjork this would be a great movie; but without her it wouldn't be as great either.
Best Picture and Best Actress would've been completely worthy Oscar nominations for this movie, but undeserving movies such as ""Gladiator"" and ""Erin Brockovich"" are norms for the Academy.
I'd hate to sound trite, but heregoes: ""Brilliant.""(This movie is)
This movie is an intense study of humanity--how situations provoke the actions and emotions in us. Selma is not a weak character, as one reviewer claimed. How many of us would keep a word to someone with our life at risk? Selma refused to reveal Bill's financial troubles in court, which ultimately would've worked on her behalf.  She's a woman with the rare strength to keep a promise, regardless of the consequences. Selma was a simpleton with an iron will, but a tender heart. I won't give the ending away, but it will be one of the most intense cinematic experiences you will ever see.
Bjork gave arguably the most powerful performance of last year. The scene where she murders Bill at his request is profound, horrifying, and intense. Even if you hate Bjork's music, as many people do, you cannot deny her acting talent.
The music was beautiful--my favorites are ""I've Seen It All"" ""Scatterheart"" and ""New World"", and the choreography was innovative.

This riveting, heartbreaking film won the coveted Palm d'Or for Best Picture at the 2000 Cannes Festival. Bjork plays quiet, heroic Selma, a single-mom factory-worker secretly going blind and saving money so her son, who also has the inherited condition, can have an operation before he too is blind for life. Bjork, who won Best Female Performance at Cannes, composed the startling, poignant songs that illuminate the images and emotions of a woman who retreats into a fantasy world ""where nothing dreadful ever happens"" while her real life spirals out of control.
What sounds sentimental and smarmy is anything but as written and directed by Lars von Trier (""Breaking The Waves"").  This visually exquisite film that plays with the blurred borders of reality and fantasy co-stars Catherine Deneuve and Joel Gray.

Director Lars von Trier casts an hypnotic spell with his hand-held PC Digital epic that seduces the eye and intoxicates the ear.  Icelandic super rock star Bjork stars(in only her second film) as a Slavic emmigrant to the Northwestern U.S. in 1964, with her bespectacled son in tow. Both suffer poverty and failing eyesite. As Selma, the mother, Bjork weaves a soulful, heart-wrenching performance throughout this seminal musical-comedy tragedy. She sits in a darkened theater watching Warner Baxter and cast in 1932's classic ""Forty-Second Street"", and dreams of dancing in a musical herself. Her multicolored singing dream sequences are perhaps the highlight of this instant classic. I had to buy the soundtrack CD immediately.  You will too. French actress Catherine Deneuve and acclaimed hoofer Joel Grey co-star. The Academy Awards voted ""Crouching Something"" best foreign film for 2000. Nobody spent millions promoting ""Dancer in the Dark"" in Hollywood. Not enough people took a chance on a risky new cinematic art form.  The years to come will broadcast their folly.

1280017,5,B00003CXKS,"Danish director Lars Von Trier, who gave us BREAKING THE WAVES, one of the most thought-provoking and controversial films of the 90s, tops himself with this stunningly original film, already one of the most discussed films of the new decade and winner of this year's Palme d'Or at Cannes.
Icelandic rock performer Bjork (winner of the Best Female Performance award at Cannes) is Selma, a Czech mother working in Washington State in the 1960s, scraping together the funds necessary for an operation to stem the impending blindness of her son Gene, a degenerative disease to which she herself has already fallen victim. As her blindness progresses, Selma finds escape in the happy worlds of her deluded daydreams which are influenced by the highly-stylized Busby Berkeley musicals on which she was weaned.
Unlike those films, however, this film is not a musical but rather a very grim, emotionally enervating film peppered with the several incongruous musical numbers which are Selma's reveries. The musical numbers work beautifully, however, as welcome relief to not just Selma but also to the viewer who is dragged by Von Trier through every brutal scene in Selma's increasingly pathetic life. (If you saw BREAKING THE WAVES, you'll know exactly what to expect.)
The film is certainly not without its faults. Von Trier's insistence on shooting in digital video (and then transferring to film) results in a much less resolved and very unfilm-like image, especially when magnified on a huge cinema screen (this is not a problem at all on the DVD). Furthermore, his insistence on obeying the Dogma tenet of realism by overuse of shaky hand-held cameras is annoying at first, though the realism it introduces is appreciated by the end, especially when contrasted with Selma's musical fantasies which are shot almost completely with stationary cameras, and with much more color. Finally, the viewer is required to suspend disbelief through some huge plot holes along the way, especially near the end.
Despite these flaws the film is an emotional powerhouse which will leave patient viewers rewarded, albeit emotionally drained. At its center is the extraordinary performance of Bjork, a newcomer whose voice and face are as expressive as any seasoned actor working today. She is also the contributor of the music in the film's amazing musical odysseys. An incredibly powerful film.",985737600,,2376,5.190104166666667

But Bjork's beautiful portrayal was completely entrancing and awe-inspiring, and the film had me hypnotized.  Why Bjork wasn't nominated for Best Actress at the Academy Awards I'll never understand.  This film also should have been nominated for Best Picture.  I certainly think that it was the best one I'd seen all year.  Emotionally devastating yet heartfelt and wonderful, Von Trier's film connects with the audience and leaves you to sit, stunned, marveling at the film you have just experienced.

1280118,1,B00003CXKS,"As a long-time fan of Bjork's music, I had eagerly awaited the release of this film here in D.C. I still can't believe how disappointed I was when I finally saw it.
An interesting comparison can be made to 'The Blair Witch Project.' For one, both films have bitterly divided filmgoers into isolated camps. For those who complained bitterly about 'The Blair Witch Project' and its use of shaky, hand-held cameras, be prepared for more of the same here. I wasn't particularly bothered by TBWP's camera work but found Von Trier's virtually unwatchable. He never seems to focus on the action (or the actors) at hand, and seems to decide his shots on a whim. If you enjoy this chaotic, cinema verite style of filming then you'll enjoy this. But while I feel this worked in TBWP, (afterall, those were supposedly student filmmakers) I feel it makes for an unpleasant, distracting, filmgoing experience in a professionally made production.
I had hoped for great things from Bjork's music, but was sorely letdown on that count as well. Her songs fail to lift the film into the surreal, blissfully happy realm Selma seems to retreat to when confronted with adversity, and never provides the much needed respite from her otherwise dull, depressing life. I found the songs jarring and unpleasant, and none of them had any discernible hooks. In addition, the decision to have the actors (other than Bjork, of course) sing during these musical numbers was a woeful miscalculation, as few seem to possess any real singing ability.
The script is manipulative, nasty and brutish (but, unfortunately, not short). The excruciating courtroom scenes were so predictable and one-sided that it seemed that much of the film had been written more as an angry screed attacking the American criminal justice system and less as a compelling drama documenting a woman's mistreatment here in the U.S. Von Trier clearly lacks the grace and subtlety that could have lifted this film into a higher place.
If you find pleasure in revelling for hours in one calamitous event after another befalling a heroine who continually makes  foolish decisions, then by all means, you should see this film.
If, however, you find this sort of boorish, amateurish filmmaking annoying and a waste of your time and money, treat this one like the plague.
By the time the film ended, I was among, perhaps, seven filmgoers remaining from a high of forty to fifty at the start.

1280119,5,B00003CXKS,"I was so excited to see in my mail box last night, my DVD of Dancer in the Dark had arrived!  It was total magic.  I finally get to see what everyone has been talking about .  This movie is exhausting and coming home from a tired days work I was totally glued to the TV after being so enthralled by what this movie does to your senses.  At first, this movie looks like a boring documentary (with the exception of the beautiful overture and the colorful tapestries you see at the beginning).  But then this movie turns and turns and turns again, from one glorious scene to the other.  The musical numbers are like nothing you have ever seen in a musical.  Raw, deafening and most of all SURPRISING!  I think in the Hollywood hey day, musicals simply became all too familiar and predictable.  This movie annihilates all of that by slapping you with the most shocking dance and music sequences ever created.  The story is uncomfortable and very real.  I kept thinking of the ""Blair Witch Project"" with the camera-how it moves, adding a sense of realism and how the dance sequences are shooting from 100's of different angles.  Bjork's music (or should I say Selma's music) is something of a revelation for our times since musicals are supposed to be innovative and unique (think about it-how long has it been since you've actually seen a musical that is innovative and unique?).  What this movie capitalizes on is that Bjork holds all of those qualities and more.  But what makes this movie really work is it's dark and ultimately harsh story, continuously threading musical numbers and showing this faux hopefullness that Selma very much wants to embrace but can't.  She can't because of the abrasive world she lives in and the sad reality that keeps her from her hopes and dreams for her son.  This is not the Sound of Music or Xanadu or Grease or West Side Story or Gigi or that gawdawful musical South Pacific.  Although this movie has the essence of all of those movies it's different because the story isn't decorated with candy coated songs or a boring and frilly Hollywood story.  This musical is the real deal and delivers something that makes a huge reinvention of a timeless idea that somehow in the 70's and 80's got seriously skewed.
With that said, this DVD rocks my socks off!  The sound of the musical numbers is sheer ear candy with my home theatre.  I jumped out of my seat when the first song arrived with Selma in the factory.  ""I've Seen it All,"" is a masterpiece of songwriting and it should've gotten the Oscar but how can anyone compete with Dylan?  ""Scatterheart,"" is breathtaking and when you see the scene with Bjork and David Morse you'll understand what I mean.  ""The Next to the Last Song,"" will most certainly make you cry, it did me and I am a rugby player, go figure:)  The extras are plentiful as with all of New Line DVD's, this has plenty of extras to play with and the documentaries are very thorough and most of all, INTERESTING!  After all was said and done, I finally went to bed at around 2am having seen something that was completely worth every penny in buying.  This film will remain a classic and although it didn't make millions of dollars in the theatre, it certainly has made a difference to those who continue to dream of the new great musical of the future.

I feel compelled to write this review because I'm warning all who have not seen it, DO NOT see this movie unless you feel like crying your eyes out and enjoy that stomach turning haunted feeling.  I felt emotionally robbed and completely empty at the end.  I had to sit in the dark of my living room wondering what compelled this director to make such a brutal movie.  Half way through, my boyfriend had to get up and leave cause he couldn't handle it anymore.  I had horrible dreams when I was finally able to get some sleep!
Yes, I know not all movies have a sappy sweet ending or a point in which everything turns around for the protagonist but this was just beyond belief.  I feel so bad for Bjork, I wonder if she knew what she was getting into when she accepted this role?  It must have been the toughest roll to play, I know I'd need therapy if it was me playing the part of Selma!
The only other film I might be able to compare this to is ""Boys Don't Cry,"" which I thought was great seeing as how it was based on a true story.  But it left me feeling the same as ""Dancer in the Dark,""  empty and full of grief.

I have never been so emotionally drained by a movie before. If you allow yourself to be taken in by the characters and their stories, you will be in for quite a rough ride. That being said, I just had to go see this movie again only a week after my first theater viewing. Von Trier's visual style which is used here to convey the feeling that you are watching the actual documentation of a real person's real life pays of in spades. The bulk of the film has the look and feel of someone's home movies, which may catch you off guard when you first start watching, but then suddenly all the visuals of the film fall into place when you see the vibrantly colored and steadily framed depictions of Selma's ""musical daydreams"". Both Bjork's acting and music in this film are top-notch, but be warned that this isn't your typical polished musical production. You must remember that the musical numbers are the born from wandering mind of a not very talented lover of american musicals, so the numbers all have quirky singing and dancing which fit perfectly with Bjork's character. If you have an open mind, and are feeling adventurous, you won't be disappointed with this one. Destined to become a cult classic.
The quality of the DVD is also top notch, considering that the film was shot mostly to NOT look very polished. The only knock was that Bjork herself did not directly participate in any of the DVD extras. It would be nice to hear her commentary on the film.",985132800,3,1612,4.562068965517241
1280122,5,B00003CXKS,"I work at a video store and watch a lot of movies and the reason I separate those two instead of consider them one is because to me a movie is something that should never have been made and is a rehash of the same old-same old.  I, personally, can't stand films that are as unoriginal as the shipment of Remember the Titans my store got in the other day.  I don't think that film had any original thought to it.  But enough about football movies with racial issues.  You want to read a review about this film...neh, masterpiece in cinema by director Lars von Trier.  This film is magnificent.  It is heart-wrenching.  It is beautiful in every way, and that's not the half of it.  Bjork is the most believable actress in the history of cinema.  She is the only actress who could have played this role.  No one else could have done it the same.  Her talents surpass even the most seasoned actors and actresses.  Lars von Trier is a genius.  With his 100 cameras idea he made every scene feel real, like it was happening right then and there.  He is brilliant.  Catherine Deneuve was excellent.  David Morse showed such true emotion that it's a shame he wasn't recognized, nor was his castmates and director by the Academy.  Shame on them.  The music, which was nominated, adds even more depth to the film, instead of taking away from it and giving it it's own world as some films tend to do.  See this film.  Tell me what you think.  Don't hate me because I don't like films that preach out about segregation, not because I like segregation, but because I like originality.  Especially Remember the Titans, being as it is Based on a True Story.  Why not just have the coach and his players talk about their situations instead of have someone else act them out.  Anyway, I hope you see Dancer in the Dark.  I am not afraid to admit that I, like some critics at the film festival, broke out into tears at some points in the film.  That's what this film will do to you.  It will make you appreciate what the characters are going through.",984960000,4,2032,4.39247311827957
1280123,1,B00003CXKS,"All the raves for DANCER notwithstanding, it's very possible to frequently enjoy von Trier and Bjork under other circumstances, and love musicals, and still find this dingy, amateurish picture a misfire.  Bjork's a touching, sincere actress, with a surprising kinship in her work here to the best silent film acting, and, of course, an accomplished songstress in her own field.  But on the evidence of this score, she is to traditional musical theatre and film writing, with its concerns for craft and character, what Michael Jackson is to childcare.  She and von Trier have every right to experiment, to bend the form as they will, but I submit if they're going to toss all the rules out the window, they'd better have something more to offer as a replacement for technique than the incredibly feeble writing and muddled thinking on interminable view in this movie.  For instance, von Trier adamently refused to visit America, or do any research to get the production details right, and as a result, the heroine's frequent flights of fantasy are seriously undercut by the inauthentic atmosphere of the rest of the picture.  Deneuve as a factory worker's one thing, but the wrong contents in a new box of candy, or incorrect lyrics (and muddled plotting) for the heroine's beloved SOUND OF MUSIC, a work that's known in detail by most of the civilized world, seem like stupid, easily-prevented mistakes that take you, plop, right out of your suspension of disbelief.  For fantasy to transport us, shouldn't reality be rooted in what's real?  (Where on earth's the revival house in a rural factory town that's constantly playing Busby Berkeley?)  Lame, awful songs, terrible choreography, and when Joel Grey finally shows up to demonstrate how it's done, his number's cut in such a way that he looks as lame as Bjork when he dances.  It's a DISGRACE, in a time when real musicals can't get greenlighted, that the film of CHICAGO can't get realized, but we're treated to this misshapen, pretentious mess, complete with critical huzzahs.  I wish that the strident fans of DANCER could be fated to see it eternally running at their local multiplex, on a double feature with von Trier's equally loathsome THE IDIOTS, the way Deneuve and Bjork worship at old Warners flicks.  I'll keep THE KINGDOM, thanks.",984528000,16,2300,4.9480519480519485

1280126,5,B00003CXKS,"I recently had the pleasure of viewing this film at the local cinema, and can say, without a trace of hyperbole, that this is one of the best films in years, at least since ""Kiss of the Spider Woman"" in 1985.
Unfortunately, it seems that most people have missed the point of this film. Yes, this film is 'contrived' and perhaps even pretensious; yes, there is a Marxist undercurrent to the film, with a rather preachy tone; and yes, the 'matyred mother' is a cliche. What many - both critics and the public - have failed to grasp, is that this is a truly extraordinary film, with an exceptional performance by Bjork, and some truly moving images which will linger for many days.
Selma (Bjork) manages to convey a child-like innocence and inner strength in her character; yet this childlike 'innocence' isn't the kookiness of her stage persona, it is instead a innocence that is all is right in the world, that everyone acts in an honourable way, that the world is filled with beauty, much as in her beloved musicals. It is interesting to note that as this world-view falls apart at the seams, her retreats into her fantasy world increases.
Bjork's performance is raw and intense, and has a naturalness that is unparalled in recent memory. One is looking as far back as Gena Rowlands in ""Opening Night"" or ""Gloria"" to find an equal.
Also worth noting is Catherine Denevue's performance as the tough-as-nails yet devoted friend of Selma, Kathy. This is perhaps her best performance, at least since her hey-day.  In fact all performances, from the larger roles such as Selma, to the smaller roles such as the prison officer are exceptional with the exception of Car Seymour (Linda), and David Morse (Bill) who is not up to the challenge of the confrontional scene between Bill and Selma.
The musical numbers are very good as well. The use of certain sounds to build the foundations of the song are simply ingenious: ""Cvalda"" (machines), ""I've Seen It All"" (trains), ""Scatterheart"" (record needle) etc. The soundtrack is a worthwhile addition to anyone's record collection, ""I've Seen it All"" and ""In The Musicals"" being the highlights, although it does suffer the same failing as other Bjork albums (a few brilliant songs and dreadful fillers, unevenness, etc.).
There are two scenes which resonated with me the strongest. Firstly, after Jeff (Peter Stormare) confronts Selma about her blindness, and Selma climbs aboard the train. Various scenes then proceed to be played out by the train tracks to concur with the musical number: ""Your grandson's hand as he plays with your hair? To be honest I really don't care"".
Secondly, the number which best illustrates the theme of the film - ""In the Musicals"". This song reveals - as an earlier piece of dialogue between Bill and Selma reveals - Selma's means of survival: musicals. It is here that Selma finds the strength to go on. At the beginning, she asks, ""Who is there to catch me?"". This is followed by a brilliant sequence where Oldrich Novey (Joel Grey), an actor and dancer from her native Czechoslovakia, and who was the catalyst for her love of musicals, arrives at the court to give evidence against her. Selma then ""In the musicals, there is always someone to catch me. You were always there to catch me."" I feel that this suggests that Novey, who represents musicals, is her safety net, the one who will 'catch' her. It makes an interesting contrast with the prison scenes where her strength fails her as she cannot hear any music until she hears a church service through the ventilator duct.
The beauty of the film is that despite her blindness, despite her terrible existence, and despite her looming sentence, she still manages to find beauty in dance and in music.
To anyone who has retreated into old hollywood films, or into music or art, such as myself, you are in for an incredible cinematic experience.",981763200,15,3867,4.7976011994003
1280176,5,B00003CXKS,"I stumbled upon this film by accident back in September when I was calling Moviefone. I had no idea what movie I wanted to see; I just wanted to get out for the night. One of the listed titles was ""Dancer in the Dark."" The title sounded interesting, so I asked for a plot synopsis. The synopsis sounded interesting, so my roommate and I took the subway from Brooklyn to Manhattan to see the film. I went expecting to be moderately entertained and interested. I came out of this movie in complete silence-- I was that amazed by it. I almost cried at the end, and I never cry at movies. The character Bjork plays is down to earth, smart, and believable. She was a strong woman in the face of adversity. I'm sure that if this were a mainstream film, Selma would not be played by Bjork, but by some bimbo sexpot, just so they could get a huge audience for this film... Anyway, the music was amazing. This is not your typical musical, and the music even explores the deep realms of the human mind, and sometimes provides some levity and hopefulness in the face of the odds which are obviously against the character Selma. I get chills down my spine when I hear the song ""107 Steps."" Questions that are raised by the film: How far would you go for someone you love? How just is the American judicial system?  I saw ""Dancer in the Dark"" for the second time last night, and I had the same reaction as before, if not more intense. My best friend came all the way to NYC from Philly just to see it with me, as it cannot be found anywhere else. She said it was worth the 2 hour trip, and I cannot agree more. Don't wait for it to come on video-- even if you have to travel a couple hours. It's like seeing a Broadway show in that it's an intense experience that cannot be duplicated on the TV in your living room. My question: Why can't more movies be like this?

1280177,5,B00003CXKS,"To watch this film can be called an experiance to say the least. You are taken through a carefully orchestrated mix of emotions that is the life of selma (excellently portrayed by bjork).Lars von trier has perhaps made the best film of the new millenium and one that all films should aspire to. From the carefree camera work to the quick and snappy editing the film works by both focusing on the main actors and by showing the reactions of those around them, this is perhaps the of the most striking element of the film as it draws the audience in as though they were bystanders and it serves as an excellent example of gutsy editing. When looking at the story line it can be said that the film is one of contrasts. We meet selma the moralistic migrant worker in an opprutunistic depiction of the USA, we also have the contrasts between the real world and the musical world, the rich and the poor and ultimately the innocent and the guilty. Musically the film is marvelous. The music is a perfect compliment to the films ups and downs and serves as a form of excapism for both selma and the audience in general. The strength of the music is especially noticible during the climax where we see the film and the actors at their best. Bjork is perhaps one of the greatest finds in the acting industry. Whilst at first it is hard to get used to her acting style you soon find that you are lost in her world and her innocence shines through her character. Catherine deneuve is the other major strength in the film. As Selmas faithful friend she serves as one of the films best emotional forces. Her every reaction holds an intencity that goes beyond the celluloid and strikes the audience with a previously unseen intencity.
Award winning, inspiring, Original, and amazing. The film deserves all of the accolades that it has gotten and so much more. Whether or not it wins any major american awards depends really on how they react to lars von triers take on their society.

1280179,5,B00003CXKS,"For much of Lars Von Triers newest non Dogme 95 film, I was having a flashback to nearly every bleak and depressing Danish and Swedish film I've ever seen.  This is bleak, this is depressing, and I know it's going to get worse before (or should say if,) it gets any better.
It's in English, and Bjork's elfin face is a fascinating one to watch, even without make-up (which is usually how we see it) and in too close close-up in Dreyer (Passion of Joan of Arc) fashion.
For the first 40 minutes of the film we are treated to some of the most seemingly natural unassuming acting your likely to see this year.
There's a very good reason why Bjork won the top acting prize at Cannes this year.  You've probably heard how she nearly had a breakdown on the film's set and talked about never acting again. She's since softened her one time bitter feelings toward Von Trier.  The entire cast however are quite good.  Even cult star Udo Kier in his cameo is unassuming in his portrayal of a doctor.
Peter Stormare (who does a nice job in Chocolat) impresses in the rather thankless role of Jeff, a not too bright factory worker who has a crush on Selma.  The film gets a huge boost from the acting of the ecclectically cast melting pot of thespians.  Americans, Danes, French, Russians, all populate the small Pacific Northwest town where most of the film takes place.
It's 1963. The former Sugar Cube leader singer, Icelandic Bjork is cast as Selma a Czech immigrant, single mom.  She is working in a factory that makes stainless steel sinks.  Selma is friends with , and works next to Kathy (who is played surprisingly by Catherine Deneuve -in a wonderful emotional performance ) and lives in a small trailer on the property of Bill (another wonderful performance from David Morse) and his wife Linda (Cara Seymour) who's spending more than Bill makes.  Selma's passion is Hollywood musicals and she's rehearsing for a local theatre production of The Sound of Music (she's playing Maria Von Trapp).  However, Selma is going blind, fast.  She'll probably be completely blind in less than a year and it's begun to affect her.  She also knows her son has the same genetic condition that is taking her sight.  It's too late to save her own sight, but Selma is working a couple of different jobs to save enough money to afford an operation for her son.  A son she doesn't even spend money on to buy Christmas or Birthday present (because every dime must be saved for his operation).
How does Selma keep her sanity?  She fantasizes about lavish musical numbers.
Now this type of thing has been before.  A character escapes their bleak life through fantasy in films such as Sherlock Junior, The Projectionist,  Purple Rose of Cairo, Cinema Paradiso and of course in Dennis Potter's The Singing Detective and Pennies from Heaven, (which was made into an above average film starring Steve Martin).
That's what we have here essentially.  Only the musical production numbers we eventually start to see aren't much better than the ones Woody Allen gave us in Everyone Says I Love You or the best forgotten Bogdanovich turkey At Long Last Love.  Well at least in this film most of the people who sing, actually can.
We've seen music videos which have reached all the way back to Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times for inspiration in turning the methodical clunks and hisses of factory machinery into inspirations for musical dance (or comedy) numbers.  And there is one of those here.  It is enjoyable but it works mainly because of  Bjork.  Her elfin face and unassuming natural way about her is suddenly hosting this powerful, voice.  The effect is mesmerizing.  It almost makes you forget to be overly critical of how shoddily the dance numbers are choreographed.
100 video cameras captured the musical number in the factory.  I'm sure the best shots were used. Vince Paterson was the choreographer and he's had experience on Madonna and Michael Jackson videos, and cinematographer Robby Muller is bursting with talent.  The result is not impressive. We don't get Busby Berkley, Michael Kidd, West Side Story, or even Rocky Horror Picture Show.  We get a second rate low budget road company attempting to create a best left on the cutting room floor musical number from the film OLIVER. Nothing here comes close to that wonderfully conceived Grand Central Station musical number in  Terry Gilliam's The Fisher King.  That's the scene where the rush hour in Grand Central Station suddenly transforms into a beautiful stylized waltz.
At one point we even get Joel Grey in one of these fantasies, but we are robbed of a satisfying musical sequence with how Von Trier chooses to frame the shots.
He's making points. He's stirring up the emotions in so many ways and setting us up for the knock out punch.
I won't spoil it but let's just say, the entire film builds towards what occurs in the film's last 15 minutes.  Not just what occurs, but how it is done.
The film's final fifteen minute scene is among the most emotional and powerful scenes you'll ever see.  Selma's real and fantasy life blend and we are left with the promise of one more song.
I think this is one of the greatest films of the last decade, yet there is a lot of things in the film I disliked a great deal.  I think Von Trier makes some truly awful choices in some scenes.
But I've got to take the movie in as a whole piece and it would be a lie to not say the film left me an emotional wreck.  This is, of course exactly what the movie was trying to do.
Here we have a film that is not easy to watch, that is full of flaws and disappointments , yet contains some brilliant acting, and delivers a powerful and poignant knock out punch.

When I saw this in the theater, I sat in stunned silence with the rest of the audience for most of the credits. I wanted to wait for everybody to leave to compose myself, and apparently so did the rest of the theater. Two more screenings over the following weeks, and it was pretty much the same situation each thime the credits rolled.

1280181,2,B00003CXKS,"I know it seems like I haven't enjoyed many films lately and to an effect that's true but this was another case of big hype, huge critical acclaim and disappointing product. Its a contemporary musical if you will, where song and dance will erupt at any moment and while it's interesting concept to both revive the classic musical and integrate with a contemporary drama, it just doesn't seem to work. Without going into great detail of the plot and spoiling it for those who wish to see it, I will just say take a worse case scenario then think of something worse and then something even worse than that and you have the plight of the character Selma (Bjork) in Dancer In The Dark. This film seems as if it were almost made intentionally to create grave depression amongst its audience members however being the cinema going cynic I can be, I was not moved one bit but instead a little bored of how it predictably played out.
The only redeeming feature of this film for me was Bjork's amazing voice, while the songs that are sung are not particularly good, Bjork's extraordinary vocal talent shines through. However that says little about her acting ability, while she does play the role adequately and it does seem as if it were a perfect fit, she comes off as if she is merely walking through it at times and not giving it her all (if she has the all to give).
Another thing that made me uneasy about enjoying the film was its ragged style of filmmaking being the handheld focus-pulling visuals and jump cut editing. While I appreciate that this as a style and no doubt one used to deliberately evoke realism into the piece to generate a more intense emotional experience, it became unquestionably annoying especially when its shot in widescreen (2.35:1) and the cinema is particularly small (Place Centro, Fortitude Valley), it came out feeling more like an IMAX experience than an emotional one.
So while I was hardly entertained and not emotionally moved an inch, I did somewhat enjoy it and put that down at present to Bjork for doing a great job on vox during the musical segments.
So as I always seem to say, 'see it for yourself and you be the judge' but I'm giving it 5 out 10.",979603200,5,2187,4.553299492385787

Like Billy Budd, an innocent sailor with a speech defect, killed a bad sailor accidentally and was sentenced to death, Selma, a poor factory woman suffering from an eye disease, killed a neighbor in order to recapture her money saved for her son's surgery.

  Some musical scenes, especially 'Cvalda' and 'I've Seen It All,' are incredibly brilliant (Bjork's songs and Robby Muller's filming skill). But I wonder why Selma had to be put to death by hanging. Why her friends offered nothing for her defense. They only planned to use Selma's money for her defense. I think it's odd. So, in the last scene, I cannot realize her friends' grief.

1280184,3,B00003CXKS,"I respect Lars Von Trier, his pure and heinous arrogance aside he is a filmmaker of the highest calibur.  Breaking the Waves was one of the best movies of the 90's and I think one of the most heartbreaking and disturbing movies I have ever seen.  With that in mind, I went to see Dancer in the Dark.  Again, the dogma influence is there, it isn't in full-effect, but the psuedo-documentary stylings are all apparent.  Shaky camera, natural light, stark surroundings, it's all there.  This movie is a mixed bag, it's very pretentious and discards all of reality in the process.  Obviously, Lars went out of his way to make the anti-musical, but I like musicals and I don't appreciate them getting trampled as some illegitimate form of entertainment.  As most have said Bjork gives a great performance, reading interviews and things it seems she went the method acting route and just dove straight into the character.  It shows, the performance is relentless.  Not to be overlooked are Peter Stormare of Fargo fame, and David Morse, who both give excellent performances in supporting roles.  The main problems I have with this movie is the false emotion, the circumstances of some of the events, and the slap-in-the-face ending.  Von Trier is known for putting his female characters through the ringer, and just laying layer upon layer of hell on them.  This is no exception, Selma as she is called, is basically destroyed in this movie.  It seems Lars loves watching women suffer, or maybe it is what he is good at capturing, who knows.  Lastly, I have watched the movie 2 times, and I just burst out laughing when the safety-deposit box beating occurs, I find it comical for some reason.  Call me sick, but that's me.  The soundtrack is excellent, but I have written about that too much.  The movie is fairly entertaining, but all in all it just seems like manipulation.

1280185,5,B00003CXKS,"After watching ""Breaking the Waves"" I thought that Von Trier's movies are very good and very talented, but too dark and real for me. I liked the movie but at the same time I hated it for the dark/stark portrayal of everday life.
I thought that ""Dancer"" will have the same effect on me and that's why I went to see it with some prejudice. I thought that it will be cruel and depressing but actually it soon became clear that the movie is quite opposite the idea I had created in my mind. Well yes, Bjork dies a very awful death and even her life can not be depicted in bright colors, but it is not this way for her. For her the world is full of colors and clear lines even despite her near blindness. For her the life is full of music and sounds and is in fact just the non-song pieces between the songs in some musicals. But when the singing begins, it is allright again. The most interesting visual effect is the difference between real life and singing scenes. The real life is filmed with a handheld 8mm camera and the singing scenes are done with steady betas, so the songs look more colourful and more real-film-like than the rest of the movie.
Selma/Bjork speaks very much about her fondness towards musicals and that's why the singing scenes of the movie make it a happy one. It shows that we all have a place in where to hide, when everything else seems to go the bad way, the down way. And when the last song, the song that must be the greatest in a musical and at which ending the camera must fly up into the sky, is filmed with a handheld camera it becomes clear that ""Dancer in the Dark"" has a happy ending. That the clear line between musical and real life starts going hazy/blury, and that Selma has nohing to fear anymore. This is the grand finale and the camera starts to fly towards the sky.
Everybody else watching the movie with me thought it was very depressing and they couldn't understand me, when I said that it was a film about an American Dream come true.

1280217,4,B00003CXKS,"Lars von Trier returns with another controversial episode in his very controversial career. In case you don't know who he is (and most people probably don't), Von Trier set out in his film career with an ambitious and self imposed regimen. His first three films, he proclaimed, would be all about flashy style and he went about making them exactly as he said. The last in that series, Zentropa, was especially well received. For his next three he would make it about the acting - no flashy camera work, no special effects, etc. The first in this trilogy was Breaking the Waves and met with much critical praise. The second is Dancer in the Dark and boy howdy has he made some people angry.
You probably heard about Dancer and it's lead, Icelandic singer Bjork, winning the highest prize at Cannes this year over the catcalls of many critics in the audience. When I heard that, I thought maybe it was just Von Trier and his challenging style again that they were booing at. Breaking the Waves was an outstanding story shot in mostly natural light with the improvised quality of a home movie, and I loved it. Not for the crappy film quality, but for the story - many people have called it the most emotional film they've ever seen and I'd say it's certainly one of them. When I heard his next film was a musical with Bjork in it, I couldn't wait. Anyone who knows her will tell you that she has one of the most affecting voices in music today - it simply screams with emotion even when she's doing her little trademark squeaks and growls. And this is precisely the reason the film doesn't work.
Bjork plays little Selma, a Czech immigrant working at an American factory making steel pots. She lives in a small room behind her landlord's house with her little boy and is slowly going blind from a genetic disorder. Knowing that her son will need an operation soon to save him from the same fate, she works double shifts to save money for him as well as doing odd jobs part time. Meanwhile, her girlfriend at the factory Kathy (Catherine Deneuve) takes her to the movie and narrates the action as well as watching over her at work to be sure no one notices that Selma is operating heavy machinery that she cannot see.
To escape from all this, Selma dreams of Hollywood musicals and here is where Von Trier will catch you off guard. The factory sounds begin the first little musical interlude as clanking machines and riveters start the song and we're launched into a full blown, choreographed musical number under the most dank and oppressive lighting. It's magnificently unusual. Further escaping in to the world of the musical, Selma joins the cast of a local production of The Sound of Music and again Kathy winds up helping her hide the fact that she can't see the edge of the stage. In true Von Trier fashion, it's simply hopeless melodrama.
That wouldn't be a bad thing in and of itself, but when things start going seriously wrong, Von Trier stretches the characters credibility to the breaking point. Selma's big hearted land lord Bill (David Morse, 'Brutal' from The Green Mile) winds up sharing his secrets with her one night and she quickly discovers herself in a situation in which she has to commit murder to save her son. Then the trial happens and Selma is once again trodden on - basically everything that can go wrong does. By the end of the film, we've seen so much of her bad luck that we just stopped believing in her as a real person. And that's the central failure of Dancer in the Dark.
Bjork's musical numbers are so impassioned and so effective that it's a real shame Von Trier didn't just go whole hog with it - make an out and out musical. Then the melodrama wouldn't have mattered because we expect that in a musical. Her number on a railroad bridge where she can no longer hide the fact that she's blind, simply brought the house down. Dancing along a bridge and playfully falling on and off the passing train while she sings about having seen everything she needs to - it's just astounding. We were reduced to blubbering idiots after seeing that. Then by a later number in the theater where Selma says she loves musicals so much because ""there is always someone to catch me.""
In the end, though I like Von Trier very much, I have to say he made a misstep on this one. When you have a talent like Bjork, whose acting (though very admirable) will never compare to the power of her singing voice, you have to take advantage of it. The upshot of it all is that the non-musical portions of the film drag horrifically by comparison. By the time we come to the finale, we still don't find ourselves engaged by these characters partially due to the aforementioned weakness but mostly because they're simply not believable in a realistic setting. If Dancer in the Dark were allowed to live on that fantasy plain of the musicals that Selma loves so much, we could buy into it. As it is, Von Trier reduces the gorgeous music to mere melodrama. But man that music is great!",976492800,3,4987,4.523809523809524
1280218,5,B00003CXKS,"I've just watched this movie and I'm surprised and speechless. I'm not a Bjork fan, but I must admit she was perfect in the role of Selma, an imigrant who suffers from a genetic disease which will make her blind. She has a son, and her only concern in life is raise money to pay for his surgery when he turns 13. She works in a noise, dark and depressing factory, and loves broadway musicals. Due to this fact, she lives magical moments in this hard task, imagining she and her co-workers are part of a real musical.
The plot is simple, but at the same time deep, showing what a parent can do in life to save his children. I have to recognize it's a very dramatic film and almost everyone leaves the movie theater crying. But this is only a detail in such a powerful and timeless story.
A film everyone should see!",976060800,8,814,4.258064516129032
1280219,5,B00003CXKS,"There are no words to describe Bjork's acting work in this movie. When I watched Dancer in the dark, I found myself completely drawn into Selma's world and I could really symhatize with her. The characters were so real that you could actually feel their emotions when watching the movie. I've never seen anyone being more real than Bjork was as Selma, giving her life.
  The plot was a little bit sloppy, but the actors were so great that it didn't bother me much. Even though the camera work has been critisized a lot, in my opinion it just gave the movie a bit of a documentary feeling, like the wiewer is seeing Selma's life through the eyes of some outsider.
  A great movie and breathtakingly acted. Had me crying in the end left me speechless fo a long time. A definite must see, even if Bjork isn't one of your favorite actors.",975888000,,834,4.431372549019608
1280220,4,B00003CXKS,"I'm not alone in saying that this film both leaves a powerful imprint on anyone who watches it and infuriates at the same time with its fairly mediocre storyline and lack of attention to detail.
First about the good things though. I'm not a huge Bjrk fan, but after watching ""Dancer"" I had to acknowledge her superior acting skills -- it truly seemed like a one-time experience that squeezed the most out of her. Similar praise goes to ""Cathy"" Deneuve who was quite good at what she was doing as Selma's friend. But the musical interludes must have been the element I enjoyed the most: they were simply good songs, the movie served as a great video to them, and the actual idea of incorporating this sort of a techno-Bjrky act amidst this film, set in the 1960s in a rather prosaic context, was very interesting, to say the least. Plus, looking at the main character's delusions (who in fact seemed like an eight-year-old throughout the film; her son appearing more mature) was quite touching.
Despite all this, you can't help thinking of Selma as Bjrk, there's no way she resembles a Czech immigrant -- if they'd tried hard enough, they would've figured out how to properly pronounce Oldrich Novy, at the least! The supporting cast were so obviously un-American; the landscapes so conspicuously non-Washington State; and Bjrk's accent, so bloody Cockney.... Apparently von Trier's idiosyncracies, such as the famed fear of flying, and thus shooting most of the scenes in southern Sweden, were kicking in big-time. He was making his art (the camera work, that I should have mentioned, too, rocked), not teaching us geography, I guess.
To top off my criticisms, the story was so bland and simple and not special at all. This film was about acting, as I said.
Oh well, it was a difficult movie to watch -- it caused a lot of mixed feelings. Still, it was definitely a fresh introduction to my viewing repertoire for this year. If you're not the Arnie Schwarzenegger or X-Men type, you might like it.",974851200,2,1997,4.75792507204611

If the musical numbers weren't in this movie it would be very difficult to handle, but because of it, the film is merciful in terms of your emotions.  If you don't cry at the end of this movie I have no idea what else can.  Bjork is amazing, Catherine Deneuve is amazing, everybody is amazing.  GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!",972950400,,427,4.565789473684211

1280223,5,B00003CXKS,"Like all works of art that have dared to push the boundaries of their respective mediums, Dancer in the Dark is a film that is just as widely hated as it is loved. Some critics have lauded the film as a work of brilliant originality, while others have denounced it as pretentious and self-indulgent. Admittedly, this controversy was one of the reasons I was eager to see the film for myself. Well, by the end of this two-and-a-half hour musical-drama, the handful of men and women sitting with me in the small art house theater were either too stunned to speak or so overwhelmed with emotion that they were reduced to fitful sobs. When the credits hit, there was a guarded applause.
Sure, von Trier's post-Dogma 95 film still adheres to many of the tenets of that minimalist movement of which he was a cofounder, and in doing so, there are moments in the film that reek of artistic self-importance. But even the most hardened cynic cannot walk out of this film without being affected by the shattering power of Bjork's performance or the ingenious directorial artistry that von Trier evinces in telling her story and, more impressively, in making us care about it. As Selma -- the Czech immigrant factory worker who is slowly losing her eyesight -- Bjork is able to surpass the melodramatic tendencies of the script and piece together a human portrait so honest and poignant that it is nearly impossible to walk out of this film without being haunted by it.
Sure, the film deals with tough subject matter and is often quite sad, but I wouldn't call it depressing. For me, the term ""depressing"" applies to a situation that is devoid of hope or is burdened by the overwhelming weight of hopelessness. Though Dancer in the Dark is about a woman laden with miserable circumstances, which increasingly worsen as the film progresses, von Trier always makes it clear that Selma is actively in control of her destiny. She consciously makes the decisions that lead to the state that we leave her in at the end of the film, and knowing this makes her fate somewhat more bearable.
It seems that as the art house/indie film world is gradually blending into the mainstream, and filmgoers are becoming more and more savvy and are expecting more from cinema than just entertainment, people are also becoming overly critical of films to the point that the emotional magic of the movies is slowly being phased out. Dancer in the Dark is a film that is unabashedly outright in its artistic extremes and disarmingly honest in its emotional manipulation, but in the capable hands of gifted, compassionate artists like Lars von Trier and Bjork (who composed and performed the astonishing soundtrack), it is a film that obliterates the restrictive floodgates of contemporary cynicism and allows one to both weep and revel at the delicacy and the intricacies of the human condition.",971827200,4,2859,4.813008130081301
1280224,2,B00003CXKS,"Lar von Trier has a new film out. No it has little to do with his brilliant Zentropa, but it does borrow the essence of the central character of Breaking the Waves. However it takes this character and proceeds to put her into a 2 1/2 hour MTV Bjork video. Yes, Mr. Anti-commercial von Trier has stooped to this: a niave virtually blind Czech girl (Bjork) who has a 12-year-old son (Bjork looks barely 12 herself) works doubleshifts in a Washington State pot-making factory to pay for her son's eye operation. What appears to be an amateurish super-8 documentary (but it's intentional...I guess) set in 1964 turns into a combination of Dead Woman Walking and The Sound of Music. Ultra-unbelievable scenario which has a message muddled by useless music and dancing. Only for hardcore Bjork fans. For von Trier fans go back to Zentropa, his one great film.",971654400,3,853,4.77027027027027

She is definately a super-talented individual.  The film direction is maticulously met with great artistic vision, from the choreography to the cinematography.  The film is graphic, beyond the reach of most films, and i believe it adequately portrays the horror of death as equally as it portrays the bliss of surrealism.  See it in the theatres.  If you can't, then wait for the DVD, but i guarantee you that it will make a greater impact on you on the big screen.",971481600,3,613,4.5181818181818185
