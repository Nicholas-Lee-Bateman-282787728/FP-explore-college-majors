7822476,4,630221582X,"Victor Sjostrom dominates Swedish cinema, as both director and actor, until the arrival of Ingmar Bergman.  This Swedish Film Institute documentary is full of generous, tantalising, beautifully refurbished clips of his silent masterpieces, including 'The Outlaw and his Wife', 'The Phantom Carriage' and 'The Monastary of Sendomir'.  Another bonus is a rare interview with Bergman, who discusses Sjostrom at length, as influence, father-figure and collaborator (Sjostrom is most famous for his lead role in Bergman's 'Wild Strawberries', a rare excursion into thespian restraint on the evidence of this documentary).
The downside is the lack of contextualisation, about Sjostrom's place in Swedish cinema, the importance of his life on his work (tantalisingly hinted at by his disciple), his development as an artist, or his awareness of the other great silent directors.",993686400,,871,5.6923076923076925
