3724377,4,B001NY4WWY,"As an education experience, I enjoyed this film very much. As a person who has studied Vodou and Santeria I have studied a much more sanitized and simplistic version of Haitian history. This film was much more balanced and seems to have presented things as they were. The revolution was a human victory but like most revolutions was bloody in the event and aftermath and that was presented in this DVD.",1255564800,14,402,4.676056338028169
3724378,4,B001NY4WWY,A great documentary that is a useful primer for understanding the complex and epochal events surrounding Haitian independence.,1253923200,5,126,6.055555555555555
3724379,5,B001NY4WWY,I really enjoyed watching this documentary with my kids. It helps even people with no backgrounds on Black History develop a clear understanding of who Toussaint Louverture was and his contributions to the freedom of all Black people.,1252454400,2,234,5.184210526315789
3724380,5,B001NY4WWY,"Like many African Americans, I knew that Louverture led the first Black independent nation, but my knowledge ends there.  Perhaps a Haitian citizen would be bored by this, but I was excited to learn more facts about this important event.

Too often, even in historical narratives, lines are clearly drawn and parties can be divided into clearly good or bad.  This history presents things as much more complicated.  At times, white French didn't want to include Blacks under their Revolution-based ideas about equality.  At other times, the French supported Haitian freedom under revolutionary ideas.  In the US, biracial individuals historically have been deemed Black and assumed to have loyalties with that community.  This documentary suggested that the mixed-race Haitian population were more loyal to the white community.

Along these complicated lines, Louverture is not presented as a modern-day militant.  He seemed to be free and not at the bottom ranks of Haitian society.  When the revolt began, he helped to ensure the whites in his birth town remained safe.  After gaining some freedoms, he saw no other path but for Blacks to return to planting sugar cane.  I once read that the Haitian flag is just the French one with the white portion ripped out, in a militant fashion.  However, this work doesn't portray the leader in a Mau-Mau manner.

I'm used to modern militants taking their fashion queues from Africa.  I try to rock kente cloth and all that too.  However, Louverture dressed like Marcus Garvey who dressed like Napoleon, in standard European garb.

The documentary had diverse interviewees: Blacks and whites, men and women, Americans and Haitians.  One interviewee spoke French, but I was surprised that no one was interviewed speaking Haitian Creole.  One interviewee had a nice chin dimple.  Another had a nose like rapper KRS-One.  Another had ears like those of Victor Garber.  The reenactments were done well too.  The clothes and setting seemed quite authentic.  There are great paintings from the era as well (the realist school?).  At times, the documentary expanded two-dimensional paintings into three-dimensional ones, possibly using techniques from animation.

The conclusive message from the documentary said something like, ""Haiti was in turmoil then and that turmoil and danger continues to this day.""  This may not make some Haitian viewers happy.",1242086400,31,2389,5.251322751322752
3724410,3,B001NY4WWY,"This documentary is a bit too vague. It does not have depth.
Also, some of the comments are misleading.
PBS could have done a better documentary.",1401494400,,145,4.615384615384615
3724411,5,B001NY4WWY,"we set the tone for freedom by defeating the napoleon army and spread freedom around America and the world.
Ending slavery and helping others was our goals",1399161600,2,155,4.777777777777778
3724412,5,B001NY4WWY,"This terrific DVD was ordered to educate our church women, who were studying Haiti culture, history and problems, from a Christian approach to reaching our to the inhabitants to help in the best way.
It added a new dimension to our understanding of the courage, honor, and pride of these people who bravely faced colonialism as well as hurricane and earthquake to hold on to the core values of their native country.

The film was excellent!",1396915200,2,440,4.7894736842105265
3724413,5,B001NY4WWY,"Caribbean revolution of 1800s with all the superpower of that time, England, France, Spain and US. After 50,000 dead French soldiers, Saint-Domingue a French colony on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola from 1659 to 1809 became Haiti in 1803, the first black republic in the world. Haiti's constitution by Toussaint Louverture in 1802 to decree slavery would not exist in  Saint-Domingue  was the first in history to prohibit discrimination based on skin color, a milestone that US law would not guarantee for another 150 years.

Jean Jacques Dassalines died in 1803 in a freezing cell in France but before leaving Saint-Domingue he said ""You have only cut down the trunk of the liberty tree of the blacks in Saint-Domingue, it will spring back from the roots for there are numerous and deep"".

A well down, informative history documentary. Bravo.",1395792000,2,847,5.071942446043166
3724414,5,B001NY4WWY,"It gives a pretty good over view, however it was missing much information  about this great period in our history. I wish it would have gone into more about Dasilines.",1377388800,,167,4.566666666666666
3724415,5,B001NY4WWY,"I have heard the name before but this documentary brought him to life.
The French, Spainards, and the English sure did bring some terror to all the world.
the Africans that lived in Saint-Domingue really fought for the freedom.
This is a good History lesson that I never heard before.",1366243200,,284,4.7
3724416,5,B001NY4WWY,"Much information on a little known (rather presented openly) part of Western History. The French, American  and Haitian Revolutions are not treated as one unit or tied together as in this documentary. Fear invoked by an African American military leader only a few miles from the southern United States was real. A New Orleans paper (DeBow's Review) expressed clearly the South's fear of ""an invasion to free the Black slaves by Toussaint Louverture and 40,000 Black troops"". Sort of explains why the repression was so strong in the pre-Civil War South. This man defeated Napoleon, Spain and England! Colonial Super-Powers of the day. Also, though not definitively explains how U.S. boycotted and destroyed sugar production in Haiti, which was its most important product and source of wealth. Thus, we are involved in Haitian affairs today because of fear and shane for destroying a possible rival country. Keeping them in a colonial state of dependence as all former European colonies in Asia, Africa and Middle East.",1357862400,5,1017,5.163636363636364
3724417,5,B001NY4WWY,"Although I may be bias about this movie because I myself am Haitian, but this documentary was great!! It clearly shows the roots of how a country can become the first black independent country!! Although the methods of getting there was crude Toussaint did what he had to do to help free the country from slavery. This movie if watched closely by the people of my country can also help the leaders of my country now. Hopefully everyone can watch this documentary and learn about the history of Haiti.",1329091200,6,500,4.629213483146067
3724418,2,B001NY4WWY,"I purchased this DVD hoping to watch a fascinating and in-depth look at Haiti's amazing but unsung revolutionary period, and instead found a rather dry documentary that merely skimmed the surface.

If you're at square one and know nothing of Haiti's history, the documentary is fine.  But for one who already knows something of this period in Haiti's history, you aren't going to learn anything more than you already knew by watching this DVD.",1295395200,3,443,4.972972972972973
3724419,4,B001NY4WWY,It is interesting that information about the Haitain Revolution is finally being made available.  Toussaint Louverture was only one player in that history and more of the narrative needs to be told.  It is a story of slavery to freedom to slavery.  We also need to see the global implications of the only successful slave revolution in history.,1264896000,13,344,4.896551724137931
8328221,5,B001NY4WWY,"very informative, always wanted to know a more in depth analysis of how and why the only slave revolt in the history of the world transpired
Learned things which corrected my misconceptions on the man who was credited with leading the uprising, such as his motives and mistakes. This documentary along with Blacks in Latin America (the part on Haiti) really gives an understanding of how African Descendants were and still are forced into poverty by Europeans and their descendants  in the western hemisphere and why?
