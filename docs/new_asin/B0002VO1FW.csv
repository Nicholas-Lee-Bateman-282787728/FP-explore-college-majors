8318046,2,B0002VO1FW,"I made again the mistake of purchasing a DVD from this couple, this time because I did not read who were the producers.

Mi first error was the DVD about the Red Sea, on which I already wrote a review. This is is not as bad as the other one but definitively all the works of these producers (as you can red in any review of their collection) can be classified as Home Movies; some fairly good in this category although others are just for laugh. They manage to advertise very sucesfully but at the end they will barely sell any product.",1145145600,2,536,4.254901960784314
