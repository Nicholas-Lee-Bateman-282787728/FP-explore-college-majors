8254702,1,B00149AZ9C,"I purchased this movie because Margaret Markov, whom I saw in ""Pretty Maids All In A Row "" (1971) and really liked.  Was I ever surprised.  I watched the movie without much thought as the VHS quality is so bad I could barely watch it and it was a women in prison sexploitation film.  Then today I received and watched ""Black Mama, White Mama"" (1972) (Which was just re-released Mar 22, 2016) starring Pam Grier and Margaret Markov, and realized that that was the movie I thought I was getting when I purchased ""Women's Penitentiary 10.""  So I spent time trying to figure out just what this movie really was, and here is what I discovered after researching on-line and re-watching the credits.

First, the actual titles (yes, plural) are: ""Emanuelle Escapes from Hell"" (Italian: Emanuelle fuga dall'inferno), but also known as ""Blade Violent"", ""Women's Prison Massacre"" (the title for the DVD just re-released on Dec 8, 2015, and is sold by Amazon), and ""Emanuelle in Prison"" staring Laura Gemser and Ursula Flores, with  Gabriele Tinti (Gemser's husband), Carlo De Mejo, Lorraine De Selle, and Franca Stoppi.

Second, Laura Gemser stared in ""Black Emanuelle"" (1975) (available in several different releases from Amazon) and over a dozen sequels that included ""Black Emanuelle"" in their titles.  One of these sequels, ""Smooth Velvet, Raw Silk"" (1976) (Italian: Velluto nero) is also known as ""Black Emanuelle and White Emanuelle"" which apparently led to this misinterpretation for the sub-title on the box of ""Women's Penitentiary 10"", ""Black Mama  White Mama.""

Third, the box, which is the one shown in the picture, is totally messed up.  I could find nothing about a film title Women's Penitentiary 10; the picture on the box has nothing to do with the film contained there in; MCM Entertainment, the listed ""Registered"" distributor, seems to not actually exist, although there is a company by that name in Australia; the cast and other information is totally incorrect as stated above.

This movie, then, should not be purchased: the tape quality is awful, with a number of points where the picture completely goes black and the sound is hard to hear (for me).  If you are looking for the Pam Grier and Margret Markov film listed in the credits on the box, the correct item is ""Black Mama, White Mama.""  Again, this was just re-released and is available from Amazon.  If you are looking for the Laura Gemser and Ursula Flores/Gabriele Tinti movie it is available as the recently re-released ""Women's Prison Massacre"" [Blu-ray] and also available through Amazon.",1458950400,,2564,4.985915492957746
