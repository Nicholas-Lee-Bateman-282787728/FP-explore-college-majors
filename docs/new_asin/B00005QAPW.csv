1646830,5,B00005QAPW,"I try to see the majority of the gay themed movies that come out and I am usually disappointed with the poor quality.  Fortunately, I did not feel this way about Nico and Dani.  It's a charming, sensitive, realistic film which was very well done in all aspects.",1009670400,7,261,4.416666666666667
1646831,1,B00005QAPW,"The boys are beautiful, but my spanish is very rusty.  The box says ""Subtitles in English,"" but not on the DVD that was included.  I went to the languages submenu of the DVD.  It showed english as selected.  I hit select, but when I returned to watching the movie, there were no subtitles.  It made watching this movie very difficult for me.
I only give it one star, because as I previously stated, ""The boys are beautiful.""",1008892800,4,424,4.454545454545454
1646832,4,B00005QAPW,This film is about what two 15/16 year old males do when left to their own devices.  This takes place in Spain and the twist is one of the boys begins to fall for the other. I could see an American version of this turning into American Pie 3 but not in this Spanish version.  All aspects of the film are handled in a sensitive and realistic way.  The natural awkwardness and shyness of the boys combined with their very childlike excitement of being on their own comes across as very natural.  The young actors did a great job.  This is a great buddy film and if you liked Wild reeds or Beautiful Thing you will like this film.,1008547200,12,627,4.235294117647059
1646843,4,B00005QAPW,"Dani (Fernando Ramallo) and Nico (Jordi Vilches) are two teenage friends who spend one summer together in the seaside near Barcelona. They are skinny, a bit awkward and average in looks, a lot like a lot of sixteen or seventeen-year-old boys who are experimenting with sex with each other and with girls. It may be just a phase that Nico is going through but Dani figures out, and is comfortable with his feelings, that he would rather spend time with Nico than with anyone else. As he tells Nico on one occasion: ""I would watch you all day long."" The film is in no way exploitive and shouldn't offend the most conservative of viewers. The sex between the young men hardly exists; the small amount of nudity is tastefully done. The naturalism of the film is refreshing and totally believable.

The two young men spend a lot of time on the beach in scenes that are beautifully filmed in this sweet coming-of-age film that will not disappoint you.",1196121600,,945,4.625
1646844,5,B00005QAPW,"I bought this film for its promise of sunshine, feel-good charm, adolescent awakening and a tolerant treatment of homosexuality, and that's just what I got. It is a hundred percent enjoyable film of one summer in the lives of two friends. It is very refreshing to see a Spanish treatment of sexuality that is frank, funny and open without being tasteless -- what a liberating contrast to they way these things appear in most Hollywood films. The film is based on a successful play, and this shows in the thoughtful script. The two main characters are a delight: I have rarely seen such an almost cringe-makingly true-to-my-owm-memories rendition of teenage awkwardness. At the same time, these boys are not riven by angst but fumble their way through to a happy self-acceptance.",1168300800,3,778,4.9465648854961835
1646845,5,B00005QAPW,"I can't say that when I saw this movie for the first time I loved it. It was probably the 3rd time I saw it on cable, that I truly loved it. This film has so many aspects to it that really take me back to my adolescent years. And also having traveled to Spain back in High School, this brought back a lot of good memories. I loved it! It brought back my days of coming to terms with my sexuality but also just being a dumb adolescent male. The sex, the joints, the beach. Everything in this movie makes me smile. One scene that I love is toward the end, they are running in the mountains, there is an english song playing (If anyone knows how I can get a copy of the soundtrack please let me know). Nico y Dani just epitomizes my memories of that time. This movie is one of my favorite movies and I agree that I never get bored of watching it.",1127865600,4,843,3.9940828402366866
1646846,4,B00005QAPW,"At the end, this movie is just like the summer, you'll find that you hate to see it go away.  It's a movie about summer worth viewing all year round.

It is about what every good summer vacation is about:  Everything and anything, but nothing specific.  Just seeking to have as much fun as possible.  Play, lust, love,... whatever.  Maybe one or two things that later seem a bit reckless?  Why not?  So throw yourself into this film with the same reckless abandon, and just let it take you wherever it takes you.  And don't worry, whatever these two guys do won't go on their permanent records!

Everyone can find some connection to this flick, whatever their age or sexuality.  It's about a carefree time of life that seems almost too long while it lasts, and ever so fleeting and lost once it's gone away.  A time when we are content to simply see how things play out and live them without undue concern for the outcomes nor any serious consequences for missteps along the way.

For teens, it's what every summer promises to be.  For those is their twenties, it's what summers used to be just a short time ago.  For everyone else, it's a salient recollection of what summers used to be, long ago.

Other good movies in this genre:  ""Come Undone""  which I've reviewed on Amazon, and that review cites yet another good title.",1124496000,2,1325,4.518987341772152
1646847,5,B00005QAPW,"The movie Nico and Dani really transforms the age of clumsy ackwardness known as purberty into a gentle movie of developing characters. Nico and Dani being both sixteen start experimenting but as Nico is drawn closer to women, it is Dani who finds himself attracted more to men (Nico in particular). The story finds both Nico and Dani's friendship tested by conflicting and confusing emotions.

Director Cesc Gay does a wonderful job of retaining the crudeness and roughness of the actors which only creates a greater sense of innocence, charm and ackwardness of this tender coming of age tale. Nico and Dani were cast perfectly as the two skinny, gangly young friends and the use of Spain, as the background, adds to a carefree time between the youngsters interacting lives. I think the movie will touch some memory in everyones life when they had that first crush, first kiss and first hormone explosion that caused many teenagers to be daring and fearless.",1110844800,4,959,4.919753086419753
1646848,4,B00005QAPW,"This was a fun, simple flick about two teenage friends spending the summer together, doing what boys do. The film focuses on the decisions they make, their responses to hormones, the future, girls, drugs, each other...

The acting is great, the characters likeable, and well-developed. If you enjoyed Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN then you should have no trouble getting into this one.",1107561600,,373,5.016129032258065
1646849,5,B00005QAPW,"Young actors playing young men and doing a wonderful job of it.  I was drawn into the angst, the rollercoaster of emotions, the longing, the confusion, etc.  The movie is really an outstanding one.  Well written, well shot and well acted.  An excellent addition to any collection.",1104451200,,280,4.8936170212765955
1646850,5,B00005QAPW,"I own this movie and I see it at least 3 times a year, just because I really enjoy it. I find some of the critics unfair because it seems they expect some kind of thesis about teenage homosexuality and it's not. It's just a story about this kid who's in love with his best friend who's not gay.

I don't really know what's with the movie that just makes me feel good. I don't know if it's the respect, and even love, all the characters are portrayed with (even when they are being selfish). You feel that even the characters with smaller parts are real people with something to tell and many times you are left wanting to know more about them.

It's a strange feeling when you see people in a movie that you would like to have in your life as a friend. I love the movie and I love all the characters.",1100736000,5,800,4.121794871794871
1646851,4,B00005QAPW,"Nico and Dani is a fresh and delightful story of two teenage boys spending several weeks together. The director (Cesc Gay) showed remarkable skill at bringing realistic and understated performances from his young actors. The camera feels invisible as we experience intimacies between the boys and the two girls they hang out with. One of the extras the dvd offers is a look behind the scenes, amazing to consider such natural performances occurred with such a busy set. An interview with the director reveals the original work on stage was with an older cast. Casting younger actors really adds to the poignancy of the story.

How different most European culture is regarding sex from the prevailing tone in the USA. Perhaps viewers will find solace knowing there are places people come of age without all the angst and homophobia of mainstream America.",1093046400,,853,5.007042253521127
1646852,4,B00005QAPW,"If you had asked me what I had thought of the movie half way through, I would have said I was slightly uneasy with it as a whole. What I mean to say is that there are just a few parts that you might catch your mind rejecting as too frank. I found myself identifying completely with the characters on my screen, and yet at the same moment feeling uneasy for some reason...
Luckily, I didn't stop half way through and the story worked itself out and developed into something to be remembered. As soon as the credits began to roll, I realized the reason I had an uneasy feeling was because the acting was so natural and real that I felt as if I was there, and since this is a coming of age story it brought back the same feelings I felt when I was going through the things I saw on screen.
The story is well written as a whole and portrays every character as actual people, even those with a smaller role. Nothing is over dramatized, and nothing is boring. It's life, shown in a way you usually don't see on film and showing an important part of life.
Another reviewer didn't see much in the cinematography, but I enjoyed it. Many times, the unique ""set ups"" and irony that you see when a play is performed on stage is lost when it is made for cinema, but the director did an excellent job of preserving it. Make sure and watch the ""Special Features"" after the film and you'll see what I mean. Not necessarily things you will consciously notice while watching the film, but they work to make the film what it is.
Others have said it is homophobic, which is true to a point. But I -like most- don't look back on my experiences as an adolescent and think how reaffirming everyone was and how sure I was about everything that I did. Homophobia is a reality for many people in their life and this movie doesn't brush that under the carpet for atmosphere.
If you've seen a lot of gay cinema, you will be pleased to know this is anything but the ""same old thing"" and I recommend it with 4 stars. If you're just exploring gay themed movies, you might should add this one to your wish list and check back after you've seen Beautiful Thing, The Priest, The Trip, etc.",1086998400,2,2155,4.271393643031785
1646853,1,B00005QAPW,"Dani, who belongs to an affluent family somewhere on the southern coast of Spain, gets a summertime visit from his old friend Nico.  They hit on some girls at Nico's insistence without giving up their old pastime of krampack.  When Dani realizes that he is in love with Nico, he begins acting like an idiot: he grabs at Nico's privates when he is having sex with a girl, tells the girl that Nico is really a maricon, then pushes himself onto the local mature, sophisticated writer but runs out before they hit the bedroom.
What I find insulting about this film is that the boys never say the ""gay"" word, but they express their hatred of ""maricones"" quite often. I don't mind the director trying to pretend that gay history and culture don't exist, but it is offensive to tell a story about same-sex love that simulataneously preaches hatred of gay people.",1059264000,8,855,4.618421052631579
1646854,4,B00005QAPW,"Nico and Dani was a great story for me, as Hollywood has long lost its appeal. This down to earth story of a couple of young guys doesn't wear the label ""GAY."" I perceived this movie as a peak into two young males exploring their sexuality as they grow into adult hood. Nico will most likely follow the path for women; Dani without a doubt, will follow the path of male intimacy and companionship. A fun movie with out all the Hollywood sensation and violence. Hope you watch and enjoy the story.",1047513600,4,496,4.4021739130434785
1646855,2,B00005QAPW,"The two leads are effective, but this is a teen film and not a good one.
However, the relationship between the two leads is worth seeing because of the not so clear feelings that arise.  But the film does not delve into the questions it raises about how male teen sexuality is a confusing place even for those who know exactly where they stand on the gay/straight divide.
RENT it and be prepared to sit through quite a bit of ... to get to the so-so stuff.",1042416000,2,456,4.241379310344827
1646856,3,B00005QAPW,"I saw the movie on cable and then bought the dvd to show to my friends who do not speak english, only spanish.  After seeing it the second time I asked my self why?  It is a fun little movie, but once is enough.  I only bring it out when I have guests that do not speak english, only spanish, to show them that experimentation is part of growing up.",1034899200,,349,3.9571428571428573
1646857,2,B00005QAPW,"For me, this film failed for several reasons, all fatal.  First, as another reviewer noted, I found the characters themselves nearly repulsive - in brief, not intriguing, but opaque and practically slow-witted, with no inner mystery.  Next, the focus is too tight, just a few steps back from a Bergmanesque perspective - in brief, the viewer's quite out-of-luck if he feels little sympathy for the two boys, because this is practically a two-character film.  Next, for me at least, the theme is severely outdated (depass, aado, antequado, whatever)by about 36 years.  Its precedents are so numerous that it would be futile to attempt to list them.  Next, I agree with other reviewers that this film is NOT just about homosexuality - certainly not - let's all recite the corny depass phrase: it's about two boys coming to terms with their sexual awakenings.  Just two boys practically alone in a two-boy film - don't jump to the conclusion that other themes or parallel plots, etc. are going to enthrall you and eclipse the thread-bare homosexual-heterosexual plot line, for in fact there isn't much else to this work.
A question in my mind is whether this film was produced with the express intent of targeting an early-teen audience.  If not, the film leaves me wondering if the director ever considered that a typical theater is attended by actual, living males and females - most all of whom are beyond their teen years and find these boys' problems anticlimatic.
In fact, more varied and dramatic sexual challenges develop well after the ""awakening"" and continue for a lifetime.  All the adult audience knows this.  All the audience also knows the script-writer and the boys have other options: transexual operations, switch-hitting, the homosexual may still marry a male or female or both - they could even have been among the chromosomal minorities, or they could move to Utah and have twenty spouses, or become child-molesters, etc. - everything's possible in America. But this story is simple.  And plot-lining these rather banal and opaque characters through a cinematographic microscope in an attempt to monumentalize this awakening not only appears painfully sophomoric, but can lead the viewer during his hour and more of boredom to wonder if the director and script writer, etc., are emotionally retarded, or sexually repressed - or perhaps only twelve years old.  In effect, to this viewer, the sexual theme is so banal that I can imagine better films being made on such parallel themes as the early teen's learning to hit a baseball for the first time, or an infant's learning to eat from a spoon.
Personally, when I was a teenager, even readings like Fruehlings Erwachen, by Franz Wedekind seemed outdated, though they had charm and a certain fatal wickedness to them - but were naive in real-life context: e.g., the U.S. sends sixteen year olds to war - I suppose Germany sent them even younger at the end of WWII.  D.H. Lawrence's Sons and Lovers made a greater impact me as a kid - the quasi-nude wrestling scene between the two main male characters, and the woman confronting the bull.  But well before that, I'd read Horace' tongue-in-cheek (I believe) defence of incest in Latin, back in eighth grade (after all, if the animals do it, why not us?).
I would really recommend Rio Fugitivo, by Edmundo Paz Soldan - a much more complex and contemporary work set in Cochabamba, Bolivia - a work that deals with a spectrum of life challenges from a young boy's eyes.  I refer to the novel, since to obtain foreign films in the U.S. is tough, given the virtual entertainment blockade this country maintains toward the rest of the globe.  Thanks heavens for Internet.",1030492800,5,3681,4.914516129032258
1646858,4,B00005QAPW,"Real rating: 4.5 stars
Great movie! Nothing so amazing that you will walk away wanting to move to Spain, but still a must-see! Maybe the cinematography wasn't the most impressive in the history of the big screen: but who cares? How many of us really give a bother about the 'cinematography of a film' if we come out feeling happy?
Nico and Dani (Krmpack) is a great ""Coming to terms, yadda yadda yadda"" movie that doesn't overdo it with anything. The angst, the sex, the resentment, etc is not overdone in any part.
Had the director used gorgeous actors with rippling muscles, it too would have taken away from the film. The two characters portray with perfection: two young Spanish boys, not particularly attractive, quite awkward, and definitely not 'sexy' in the modaren-gay sense.
Nico never falls for Dani, Dani doesn't try to kill himself or gets thrown out of home: sure many of us go through a lot of bother when we come out, but sometimes it IS this easy! It definitely gives a true portayal of the socially accepting attitude Spaniards have to gay men (All about my mother was a huge hit remember!).
I got scared toward the end at the train station, I thought perhaps that the movie might take a Hollywood twist and Nico might grab Dani and kiss him! Thank goodness this is a European film, and he does not.
Definitely get this movie. It is so worth the money to see it over and over again.
Before I conclude I must mention the great supporting cast as I think noone has as yet: Marianne the Cook, Sonia the Teacher and of course Julian! (from My Mother Likes Women!). Every piece of this movie is tied together so well...can you tell I liked it?! :)",1030233600,20,1660,4.51827242524917
1646859,5,B00005QAPW,"I'm not even certain where I first heard of this film, but I'm sure glad I did. I've watched it several times and after each viewing I've come to appreciate the story, the actors and the message very deeply. I think it's the finest movie I've ever seen on the subject of friendship and ""coming of age"", bar none.
Remember back to your youth when times were simpler and all you had to do was think about what you'd do with your friends that day? Nico and Dani recalls that time in such a believable, carefree, almost naive way that all I could do was smile and enjoy the feeling. They do the normal things guys do like go fishing, hunt rabbits, hang out and party with friends. The actors portraying the characters (Fernando Ramallo as Dani and Jordi Vilches as Nico) even look like two average guys at 16--kind of gangly and skinny, just like I remember being back then. In short, I believed it all from the get-go.
The friendship we see is one that obviously has been built up over many, many past summers and each time I watch the film again, the more I realize just how deep that friendship is and how subtly and naturally it's portrayed. I mean, it would have to be pretty deep given that the two boys frequently have a ""Krampack"" (mutual masturbation session) to help each other out.
The twist in the film comes when Dani begins to realize at this time of adolescent change that he's falling in love with his best friend Nico, just as Nico is finding out how much he's into girls and anxious to go through his own rites of passage. Sounds like a recipe for disaster, doesn't it?
The beauty of this Spanish summertime story, though, is that it doesn't turn into an ""Afterschool Special"", a platform for gay community propaganda, or a ridiculous ""American Pie""-like farce. It just continues its dreamy, easygoing pace as we watch the two boys' friendship bend--but not break. There is a wonderful balance of humorous vs. ""heavy"" scenes (I could watch the scene where they're talking through the bathroom door a thousand times and never tire of it) that allows for changes of mood and pauses for reflection.
By the end, nobody dies, gets put in therapy, beats someone up to prove how ""macho"" he is, catches a disease, has a huge, dramatic, cry-his-eyes-out scene or other predictable clich. I was left with nothing but a peaceful, happy feeling that everything would be OK, Nico and Dani would always remain friends and that this film was worth every minute of my life's time I gave up watching it.
For what it's worth, I also dredged up my high school Spanish from the recesses of my memory and--along with my pause control and a Spanish dictionary--went the extra mile to learn what was actually being said and how (English subtitles can only get you so far...). That made a HUGE difference to my understanding (and my own education). I would wholeheartedly recommend you add this to your collection, watch the wonderful interviews with cast and director and give it a few repeat viewings just to glean all the magnificent subtlety from the story.
While not the ""Perfect Film"" (I'm personally a bit bothered by the boys' habit of answering nearly every important question with ""let's smoke a joint"", and the soundtrack does strike one as a bit goofy a couple of times), it's nearly there in my book. I think that it will strike a chord in many who have lived through similar circumstances. I would also highly suggest it for STRAIGHT boys who might be in the position of finding out that their best friend is turning out to be gay.
Fantastic acting by the main characters, gorgeous Costa Brava scenery and a compelling story of enduring friendship mean this'll be a film I'll continue to watch over and over again.
Other ""Friendship/Growing Up/Coming Out"" films I highly suggest: Beautiful Thing, Get Real, Edge of Seventeen (in that order...).",1026604800,95,3848,4.651982378854625
1646860,4,B00005QAPW,"Well, I just read the reviews above and I felt like having something to say.
I saw the movie when it opened here in Spain. It got me to think a little.
Most of the movies made in Spain don't get released on DVD in the U.S.A. And you could think that the ones that do are block busters or big budget productions. On the other side, Nico and Dani(Krampak is the original title) is a low budget movie that didn't break any records on ticket sales. It's a great movie, well shot and acted, and with a subtle and empathetic script. But I don't think that's the only reason why it's released in the States, I guess that it has been marketed as a gay movie and there's a big network of consumers for that. Well, I don't consider Nico and Dani a gay movie at all. It has a gay leading character, Fernando Ramallo, and a heterosexual one, Jordi Vilches, but I think the plot goes beyond sexual orientations, and I think that anyone that has been a teenager; homesexual or heterosexual, can relate to it.
I wonder if the same movie, made with the same excellence and quality, would have made it to international sales on DVD if it didn't have any gay carachter in it.
Is Cesc Gay's first movie, and only one to this day. It doesn't show. Right now he's on pre-production of a new film starring Eduard Fernandez and Vicenta'NDongo. Is also Jordi Vilches's first role on film. Before that, he did stage plays with experimental theatre company General Electrica. He's charming and unique. He's short and scrawny, but really beliavable as an  object of desire. Fernando Ramallo has done several movies before this one, he's a famous spanish child actor, but I think this is the one where he does his best job.
I would say, to describe it fast and poorly, that this is a little bit like The Wonder Years with sex scenes.",1024358400,6,1805,4.42042042042042
1646861,5,B00005QAPW,"I loved this movie.  It is refreshingly NOT like American coming-of-age movies, which I avoid like the plague.  The underlying tension between Nico and Dani over a summer's visit is a constant theme, one that can certainly be familiar to gay people.  So much of the time, teenage gay movies either tend to be maudlin, mushy or just plain depressing.  This movie is none of those.  Another refreshing aspect of the film is that it doesn't try to tie all the loose ends up at the end of the film. I bought the movie and viewed it without reading all the reviews because wanted to view it fresh without preconceptions, and I won't detail it any more than this. It is light as a feather in many ways, which was what I was looking for.  I bought the DVD and recommend that any other buyer look at the interviews with Cesc Gay and the main cast members after seeing the movie.  Another point:  the movie I received was ""unrated"" but I have no idea why this would even be R-rated.  There was no gratuitous nudity, only a topless girl in one scene.  I think the censors must've gone overboard on this one.  Highly recommended.",1012089600,53,1118,4.431372549019608
1646862,4,B00005QAPW,"This is another film that has been touted as the next ""Beautiful Thing,"" but it was not the director's intention to make a love story like that.  Rather, this is a series of snapshots of a few days in the lives of two Spanish boys who are heading down different forks in the road.  Though clocked at 90 minutes the movie speeds by in seemingly half that time.
Nico is coming to visit Dani at the coast while Dani's parents are away; he is intending to do the same thing he would do if he stayed home in Barcelona, went to Rome, or, for that matter, orbited in the Space Shuttle:  chase skirts.  Dani has begun to hear the tapping of a different drummer and has apparently had a lot of time to plan all the ways he wants to share his new interests with his long time pal.  Clearly these two have been very close.  Krammpack (mutual masturbation), the original title of the play, is not just something they've read about in magazines.
The movie is a series of fast moving vignettes of the two boys and the two girls they meet and interact with.  They move from incident to incident quickly, not lingering long nor introspecting much about what has happened.  Though the age of the two is not clear (I've read as young as 15, as old as 17) it is made clear they are both virgins and minors (in much of Europe, 16 is the age of consent).
There are some unsettling undertones as Dani experiments with sexuality, mas or menos, oblivious for some time to the fact Nico is increasingly uncomfortable with the moves he is putting on him.  There is a very unsettling, for me, date rape scene, involving the hoary old concoction Spanish Fly, not the modern date rape drug DHA.  The movie remains non-judgemental.  Director Cesc Gay keeps things from getting too heavy both by not lingering on any one incident and with musical punctuation and title cards reminscent of silent films that foreshadow upcoming scenes.  The music in the film is excellent.
Nico is played by Jordi Villachi and he is a real charmer.  Though not blessed with extraordinary good looks, it is nevertheless easy to see why Dani and Elena and Berta are drawn to him.  Dani is a very handsome young man, played by Fernando Ramalla with an intensity that is at times eerie.  He is struggling with more difficult issues than Nico, of course, and has anticipated that he is facing almost certain frustration of his desires.
When the two go their separate ways one evening Dani, in a lover's snit, tries tarting an older man, which is a cake walk for him, but the better angels of his nature prevail.
The movie ends positively; the two's friendship survives the stresses.  Nobody is thrown into therapy nor denounced from the pulpit for their misdeeds.  Nico hasn't given up on chasing skirts and Dani has learned a lot about what he wants, as well as what he doesn't want.  The worst that Nico can bring himself to say of his friend is that he is selfish.
I gave the movie four stars but if the system would have let me, I would have given it another 1/4 or 1/2 star, and if it continues to wear well with repeated viewing, as I think it will, I'll be upgrading my rating in a few months.  Nico and Dani is not ""Romeo and Julian,"" nor is it even ""Jaime and Ste,"" but it's a lot closer to them that it is to American Pie, and it's a very good movie.",1011830400,60,3306,4.399014778325123

7950046,2,B00005QAPW,"This is kinda sexy in parts, there's a hand-to-hand scene if you know what I mean.  But it's not a stellar story, or performances, and there is a flatness to the production which some might see as understated but comes off as film-schoolish in parts.  There is a preachy backnote to the film, too, which is always a turnoff.  It has it's moments, but not enough to recommend beyond a rental.  I regret purchasing the DVD, but I was taken in by the adverts for it and the copies I got from Netflix were all damaged.",1296864000,,514,4.322916666666667
7950047,4,B00005QAPW,"The awkward sex and makeout scenes only add to the low-key appeal of this Spanish film with two young male leads who are far from photogenic. I was surprised by the frank treatment of adolescent discovery of sexuality. There's a great soundtrack, and some lovely scenes of the Spanish beach life that most Americans never see.",1258416000,,326,4.839285714285714
7950048,4,B00005QAPW,"I was never this lucky in my youth, so I don't speak from experience.  Still, I was pleasantly surprised by this film.  First, many say there's not enough work about gay youth and this fills that void, given the fear that some cultures have about teen sexuality, and specifically male-on-male action.  Many people say actions come before identfications.  There are adults who are far different from the children they were ""playing doctor.""  This movie shows what happens as boys who mess around start to have a sexual identity and that sometimes this leads to two divergent paths.  Many accounts say that boys fool around until somebody says something homophobic and the boys are faced with harsh reality.  Imagine if the couple in ""Brokeback Mountain"" were teens, rather  than adults.  Some of those same tensions and realities are present here.
This work is realistic in that it features two pimply, fun-chasing, law-breaking teens.  However, in US cinema, actors who aren't cute rarely get parts.  It was shocking to see such average-looking persons in leading roles.
I wish my own country could come up with works this daring and true-to-life.",1205625600,2,1147,5.047872340425532
