6424130,4,B00KECH98U,"When I am on the treadmill watching a video I like to either be relaxed or entertained to make the time pass. This video doesn't really do either for me. But it does bring me to ""walk"" a land I have never visited and for those who enjoy ""walking"" in foreign lands, this video is for them.

Cons:
- I guess when I walk in reality I avoid man-made structures and because I am trying to walk away from unnatural environments. While the parks in Tokyo were hardly crowded I either like to see interesting unique people (maybe even stop and talk for a few seconds) or no people at all...but that's just a persona preference. At times, especially on the first walk I find the noise rather disturbing...not sure what its from...the people's voices throughout don't seem to match the people I am seeing though if a jogger passes you do hear his footfalls.
- I would love to see each video last 30 minutes if possible....not 24, not 28...like many walkers (no, not the Walking Dead kind ) I usually exercise in 30 minute increments.
- Also, when ""virtually walking"" on these videos...I DO feel like a zombie....it feels unnatural to walk without turning my head left or right even a little....maybe this is not possible with the steadycam or perhaps it would make some people dizzy...I'm not sure...
- Was this was videoed during a SARS scare in Asia?  It's a little weird to see many of the walkers in masks and some in both masks and gloves. Others cringe from the sunlight or hold their jackets over their heads..are they not used to sunlight?.It doesn't give me a relaxing experience but its not the videographers fault.....I just felt like not walking to close to the people. .

PROS:

-The video is filmed beautifully in HD..you really do feel like you are walking the pavement in Tokyo, the pavement designs in the first video make you wonder how long it took to create such a walkway.
-For those who like to visit foreign lands via your treadmill, this entire series would be perfect for you.
- The website offers generous clips for you to see exactly what you are buying.
- The entire series..cities, nature, or a mix of both....if they get you exercising more often then they are doing their job whether you are a nature walker or city walker.
-  I still maintain if one is a guy on a treadmill.....he would look forward to walking more if the videographer would visit some topless beaches on the Riviera...lol.

6424131,5,B00KECH98U,"Walk one  This walk takes you along mosaic paved walkways with excellent views of the Tokyo skyline. Most of the flowering trees are young and along the wide pathways are tulip filled beds. There aren't many people in most of the areas  much less than I expected, but there are some harried looking business men cutting across in front of you and some meandering tourists. A few joggers go past you, and you hear the sound of their pounding footfalls coming up to you and then receding.
Walk two  This walk is along established grounds, again in the springtime, so everything looks fresh and new. The delicate tree limbs reach for the sky. It was fun to see all the people in the park and will make for interesting repeat views just to people watch and guess why they were in the park on that day. You dodge people in your path quite often. There are long sections where you are walking along side huge stone block walls and occasional sighting of some much newer architecture in the distance, which makes for an interesting juxtaposition.
Walk three- This walk is the shortest, and there are less people and a few more bicyclists. You get passed by some joggers and bicyclists and you pass walkers, so your pace is somewhere in between them. This is an established park for the most part too.

I enjoyed all three walks and look forward to doing them again. I liked the feeling of being in another country and as I said, the scenery and people watching opportunities will keep this fresh. The trailer showed a virtual walk in Singapore at night that also looks fantastic.",1414972800,,1572,4.5836298932384345
6424132,5,B00KECH98U,"This DVD came as something of a surprise. I have an image of Tokyo of people packed like sardines in subways.  Since these walks are in an urban settingand in one of the most crowded cities in the worldI expected a feeling of claustrophobia, as if I would have to make my way through masses of people.

I don't know how the photographers did it, but there is hardly anybody in your way as you walk though the business district along Tokyo Bay (in Walk #1).. The architecture is beautiful and so different from what I see in Los Angeles. Its like you are entering an enchantedbut nonetheless urbancity.

Walk # 2 takes you seamlessly to a breathtaking park in the middle of Tokyo. Here, too, there are very few people to get in your way, or to detract from the incredible scenery. The forest paths eventually turn into vast, paved expanses that look like the streets of Heaven. The scenery is exciting: high rise buildings juxtaposed with Buddhist temples.

Walk # 3 takes to another vast park in the city. Who knew there was so much space in Tokyo? Here you will see joggers like you, which will give you a boost of energy, in case you're getting tired by now on your treadmill.

The pace in all three scenes is brisk enough for cycling, so this DVD is great for either the treadmill or the spin-bike. OR, if you just want to sit in your living room with a glass of wine and escape, this beautifully produced DVD will take you away.",1412208000,,1432,4.409090909090909

8658102,5,B00KECH98U,Love these walking DVD. My only problem is that I concentrate on the scenery instead of focusing on my pace.,1463270400,,108,4.45
8658103,5,B00KECH98U,Great scenic walks. Almost like being there. They run far too short for an average treadmill workout though. I am usually on a treadmill anywhere from one hour to two and a half hours. The other people in the video adds to the realism; although I am sure Tokyo is generally more crowded than in these videos.,1462492800,,308,4.421052631578948

8658106,5,B00KECH98U,"I already own the Virtual Walks DVD Tokyo at Night, so I looked forward to watching this DVD and I am very happy that I own this one. The first video takes you through the city, finally I can see the sights at daylight. Passing many impressive buildings, you also have a magnificent view on the skyline of Tokyo in this video. The other two videos lead you into nature. In the midst of the metropolis there are wonderful parks, where you can jog excellently. Many people are on the road,  you can see wonderful vegetation, it makes a lot of fun to run through this park. The background sounds are so realistic so that you have the feeling really to be there. Once again a wonderful Virtual Walks DVD with which exercising makes a lot more fun.",1432598400,,743,4.384057971014493
8658107,5,B00KECH98U,"Just received this DVD, which I use with my stationary bike.  Three very nice walks/rides around Tokyo.  Beautiful!  Total time is about 65 minutes.  I have many of Tony Helsloot's  DVDs and I find the pace of the Walk DVDs is just fine to also use with a stationary bike.  I have also bought several of the Virtual Cycle ones.",1427414400,3,327,4.366666666666666
8658108,5,B00KECH98U,"This DVD contains three virtual Tokyo walks, each about 20-30 minutes.  The first is set in Aqua City and has features impressive views of the Tokyo skyline, the Rainbow Bridge, and the Tokyo Tower.  The second takes us through a park in central Tokyo, past the Imperial Palace. The third is of Yoyogi Park, along a pathway enhanced by numerous cherry blossoms.  The camera is constantly moving forward, giving us a sense of what it's actually like to go on these walks.  Highly enjoyable and perfect for the treadmill.",1420502400,2,519,4.797752808988764
