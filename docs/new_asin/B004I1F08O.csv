8429880,2,B004I1F08O,Purchase and shipping of this product was very satisfactory.  Ordered it because of star Song Seung Hun.  Movie was so so although extremely spectacular winter mountain scenery to make up for weak script.,1351382400,,204,5.151515151515151
8429881,4,B004I1F08O,"While the story-line wasn't quite as compelling as I have come to expect from Korean dramas, the performances of my two favorite actors, Song Seung-heun and Kim Ha Neul, were up to their usual standard.  They never disappoint; so, if you are fans of theirs, add this film to your collection.",1337472000,,291,4.705882352941177
