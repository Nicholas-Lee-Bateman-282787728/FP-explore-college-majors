8097396,4,B000CCJPH0,I bought this thinking it was YEAR Four not Fourth Episode of the first year. I will donate them to a library or nursing home. Seller was exceptionally generous and kind.,1362268800,,170,4.516129032258065
8097397,5,B000CCJPH0,"THE CHARACTERS WERE ALL PRECIOUS.  GOOD STORIES WITH A SENSE OF HUMOR.  I HAVE THE WHOLE SERIES & LOVED ALL OF IT.
MANY HOURS OF GOOD ENTERTAINMENT.",1357948800,,148,4.444444444444445
8097398,5,B000CCJPH0,"Agreed that Hill Street Blues is right up there with NYPD Blue. Characters were great and a little more loving, comical than what we saw on NYPD.  Very upset we can't get our hands on the rest of the seasons.  HSB was/is one of the best crime dramas of all time.",1343865600,,262,4.117647058823529
8097399,5,B000CCJPH0,"This series is on par with NYPD Blue. The best writing and superb character developement. The only negative is am unable to purchase the rest of the series  (same complaint for NYPD Blue) I certainly hope you can get the rest of both series I have finished watching season 1 and 2.
Same problem with NYPD blue have finished seasons 1 to 4 please make both of these series available in their entirety to customers Thank you",1335571200,4,422,4.48051948051948
