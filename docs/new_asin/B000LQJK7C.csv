8163675,1,B000LQJK7C,"Horrors!  Don't buy from this rip-off artist.  I paid for a ""new"" DVD, but received instead a poorly made computer copy.  Do you want to pay for something ""new"" only to get something picked up in a second-hand resale store?  Well, if you do, this is the place.  Rating:  minus 10! ! !  I am returning this thing for a refund.  I hope Amazon with be assured I get it.",1304726400,2,366,4.128571428571429
