2473538,5,B000CSTK74,This was a very interesting part of History. The fact that it was not released until 1969 amazed me. Gave it to a friend to watc and he liked it also.,1314403200,3,150,3.870967741935484
2473539,5,B000CSTK74,A really great history of an incredibly interesting group of native Americans who came to our rescue in WWII.  My 6th grade son got a lot of useful information for a school report and gained a new respect for another group of people.,1295136000,13,233,4.4186046511627906
2473540,4,B000CSTK74,"This is a good represenation of the Navajo Code Talkers.  I like the fact that the video started with some general history of the Navajo and then went into depth on the Code Talkers.  Including some interview footage of former CodeTalkers made the video more dynamic than just a simple history.  Despite the treatment by the United States, the Navajo stepped up when needed most, a fact this DVD noted.",1224201600,4,402,4.714285714285714
2473541,5,B000CSTK74,"This DVD is very informative.  I never realized the impact that the ""code talkers"" had in the war until I saw this DVD.  This DVD draws your interest in such a way you will find yourself watching it over and over again.  It is tragic that Native Americans today are living in such poverty.  Go to youtube and type in an indian nation and see their poverty.",1209686400,2,356,4.268656716417911
2473542,5,B000CSTK74,"I have studied this subject for some years, and by far and away, this is the most extensive and comprehensive presentation of the history of Native American (primarily Navaho)code talkers in World War II.
The only issue I am aware of the video doesn't address or expand on is the theory each code talker had a Marine ""buddy"", who was required to kill the code talker if he was about to be captured.",1203724800,5,398,4.465753424657534
2473543,5,B000CSTK74,"This documentary was made before the Hollywood film ""Wind Talkers.""  The film implied that non-Native soldiers were instructed to kill Navajo translators if they were about to be captured by the Japanese.  This documentary mentioned a Navajo non-Code Talker who was tortured by the Japanese, but doesn't make the aforementioned claim.

This work is much stronger than ""The Navajo Code Talkers: Top Secret Mission.""  That documentary praised a clergy member involved with the program whereas this documentary questions that person's significance.  Furthermore, this documentary talks about the genocide that Navajos faced in the past.  They had their own Trail of Tears which led in the opposite direction.  Further, just as African-American soldiers have decried the racism in the 1940s military, this documentary noted that the Code Talkers received no special accolades after the War ended.  One Navajo equated Japanese aggression in Asia with what Navajos faced in America; this was insightful in the same way that Celie's daughter equated African sexism with American racism in ""The Color Purple.""

All the veteran Code Talkers were male, but this documentary includes  female curator that adds gender diversity.  The Navajo vets are now sweet, old men that will remind many of their grandfathers.  This may be a great work for teachers to show to Native American students.  In fact, foreign language instructors may want to show this to all students.  Unfortunately, the military could use this as a recruitment tool as well.",1163462400,30,1530,5.347280334728033
2473559,5,B000CSTK74,"One of the few historical accounts of the secret codes of WW II, which was the Navajo language which could not be interpreted by the
enemy.  No code breakers by Axis could figure out this language.  Navajo's work to send and receive was a huge asset to the allies,
since we did not have the sophistication of our enemy code-breakers.",1462492800,2,333,4.533333333333333

Young Navajo Code Talkers were so handsome, fit, intelligent and brave.",1444867200,,116,4.8
2473562,5,B000CSTK74,"Visited the Code Talkers Memorial in Window Rock, Az this summer.  This dvd tells the rest of the story
of these forgotten heros",1441584000,2,128,4.565217391304348
2473563,5,B000CSTK74,Interesting movie. I have always been interested in the history of US Wars. This book was of a selected group who initially received very little military honors. Only the code talkers stories are still being told. The Code talkers have a email site where you can actually listen to interview of these brave warriors. Recommend more people should read this and the others that I purchased.,1420329600,2,388,4.893939393939394

2473568,3,B000CSTK74,"Somehow I missed the small print - that this is less than an hour long.  It also feels almost weightless.  If you're thinking of giving this as a gift for someone, I suggest you give another smallish thing along with it.",1408752000,,220,4.341463414634147
2473578,5,B000CSTK74,I've always found it interesting that the Navajos language was used to send messages during the war without the enemy knowing what was being said. Finally I had a video that explained how the Navajos developed words for items that were never included in their history.,1407024000,3,268,4.8478260869565215
2473579,5,B000CSTK74,"as with most documentaries, facts make a more interesting story.... it make one realize just how many of the Navajos went away to the WW11... and it was a perfect idea (the code)...",1403308800,2,181,4.515151515151516
2473580,5,B000CSTK74,Concise and thorough; accurate used by nephew for paper. Too bad teacher did not believe facts and argument of code talkers impact on WWII outcome.,1394841600,,147,4.92
2473581,5,B000CSTK74,"This was an informative DVD on the Navajo people. It was interesting, factual, and featured interview clips with the actual military tribesmen recalling their experiences. Didn't want it to end.",1379376000,,194,5.5
2473582,1,B000CSTK74,"I ordered this item and very quickly received the order -- but it was the wrong item.  Instead of the DVD about the Navajo Code Talkers I received a DVD telling me how to use a GPS.  I contacted ""I-deals"" promptly, and often.  Three, four times.  No response whatever.  My inquiries keep piling up and I have had absolutely no response from Amazon, I-deals, or anyone else even remotely connected to this transaction.  Today was my fourth inquiry and I am now doubting that this matter will ever draw the attention of AMAZON or I-DEALS.

And now I have been unable to get Amazon to respond to me about a return and exchange for the correct item.  I want the Code Talkers video, not the ""how to"" video for a GPS.

I can't rate the item; I never got it.  BUT, I had to check at least one star to ""rate the item"" before I could get this review sent off. At this moment I'm hoping that if I can find items I want elsewhere, that I can do business with someone other than Amazon.",1375488000,,974,4.216216216216216
2473583,5,B000CSTK74,To learn how many of our Native Americans used their language as a form of code was fascinating. Until I saw this I was not aware of how their knowledge of Navajo could be used to help us win the war.,1356998400,,200,3.902439024390244

2473587,5,B000CSTK74,"This DVD was very interesting.  It takes you from start to finish on how the code talkers came about and served in our military.  There are interviews with some of them, they were an amazing group of men who wanted to serve their country.  I saw this DVD in a magazine and checked Amazon to see if they had it and they did so I ordered it, it was $10.00 less and I received fast delivery.",1322179200,15,388,4.078947368421052
