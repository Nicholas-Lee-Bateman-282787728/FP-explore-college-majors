8114695,4,B000EVI72S,"the story started out well, but in the end  when the secret came out, it made everything before it  a giant WTF!! But it was made in the eighties, could be a translation error, but it has lots of action with hot girls and a headshaking conclusion.",1376611200,,247,4.23404255319149
8114696,5,B000EVI72S,"I'll admit, it's been about 15 years since I last saw this film. But let me summarize the film this way: when the archvillain first appears, John William's Imperial March from Star Wars plays. Then there are the bodyguards, especially the bald guy with the lipstick and the scorpion tattoo.

Really, if you dig training scenes that involve mud wrestling, leg stretching by ropes, and upside-down pushups, this is your film.

You might hate it. You might love it. But all in all, it's whatever.",1337558400,,493,4.788235294117647
8114697,3,B000EVI72S,"This is one of my favorite old B-type kung fu/ninja movies.  If you are looking for killer special effects or modern super-speed action then go elsewhere.  This is about a woman who was trained as a ninja, who ends up training three other women to do martial arts.  There is some frontal nudity, quite a bit of humor, and a lot of classic bad kung fu (levitating, super-sticky hands, etc).  A good movie if you like the style.",1147824000,3,426,4.423076923076923
