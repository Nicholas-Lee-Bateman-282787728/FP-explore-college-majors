6305600,1,B00IZ4NHH6,"I watched this based solely on the other reviews but I'm sorry to say I did not share many of their opinions.  Homeless kids that are all good looking with great teeth and good vocabularies that are artists, writers and poets is hard enough to swallow but throw in that  there is a minuscule amount of the violence, sexual assaults and harassment that kids like this face on a daily basis is a bit too much to take.  Top it off with some overly dramatic music at keys scenes and a hapless counselor that supposedly spent time on the streets and it all adds up to a pretty shlocky film.  While I agree this is an important issue that really does need to be addressed more in all forms of media I just don't think movie is very realistic...",1409788800,10,738,4.287769784172662

6305607,1,B00IZ4NHH6,"Horrible representation of what it means to have PTSD. Such a shallow script and also a shallow performance from the lead actress who probably tried too hard and it really fell flat. It felt so formulaic and predictable. It was ""lets make a movie about homeless teens"" with no real substance and most definitely an inaccurate portrayal of what it looks like to be homeless on the streets of venice, or in any are of the country for that matter. It almost glorifies life on the streets by making these kids look happy-go-lucky for much of the film, gorging themselves on mini donuts and skateboarding around the boardwalk. Like other reviewers said, no real plot. There's very little character development. Any scene of substance is cut short with a montage to a ""moody"" shot of Sugar on the beach, sugar having sex with her boyfriend, or some other cheesy montage of homeless kids having a great time.. or dying... such extremes! Also the swearing is just obnoxious and seems to be added to make these kids seem tougher, like they DGAF about anything including basic human decency- it's just not necessary and sounds incredibly phony from these shiny actors' mouths. Sugar's story is hardly believable nor relate-able, and though it's a sad story - it's hard to even really care much about it because her character is so ""hardened"" and has no redeeming qualities to make you truly feel bad for her.  Not to mention Shenae Grimes is not a great actress by any means and her character seems to change personalities/mannerisms/speech patterns throughout the film with no believable consistency. All felt so fake and manufactured....",1471392000,3,1629,4.9021739130434785

6305609,2,B00IZ4NHH6,"Unrealistic film about homelessness. Actors were well scrubbed. Never showed the brutal realities of not being able to shower, shave or obtain medical attention. Ending was absolutely horrendous and empty. No hope. No resolution. The reality is there are billions set aside each year to help homeless, but nobody really helps. That said, this is the only truth shown in the movie. People don't really help. Every year the homeless are ""counted."" But the homeless can't count on anyone to resolve this pervasive problem. It's another scam. How about a movie on where the heck all the money goes that is intended to help the homeless.",1470614400,,632,4.971698113207547
6305610,4,B00IZ4NHH6,"Since I live in Los Angeles, I am familiar with the homeless population that I see and interact with throughout the city.  After all, this area has the highest homeless population in America.  Anyway, I thought the film showed an interesting perspective of how and why this occurs to youth.  I do feel that the movie is a bit soft in the story as I have seen and known of much more harsh circumstances that that depicted, but I do feel that it provides some depth.  Often they are runaways from harsh backgrounds, drug addicts, mentally ill, or rejected from their families, i.e for being LGBT which are 40 percent of homeless youth..  A hard story, but there are some sources that are helpful to them to move in a positive direction, which I have seen as well. I recall serving Thanksgiving at one of these youth shelters and found an array of kids there.  There are a few that stick with you as they appeared to be so devastated by life and one wonders how they can move forward in life.  Troubling indeed.  Anyway, all the places were really familiar, and tied well to the real story behind the film.
Thought it was interesting that Nastassja Kinski was in the movie as well.",1470528000,,1178,4.47196261682243

6305620,5,B00IZ4NHH6,"I can't speak from personal experience, but the acting in this film and true-to-life storytelling made this film a believable account of life on the streets. It's inspired by the true story of one person's encounter of homelessness in Venice, California. The people are so believable I can hardly believe they're acting. I think it's necessary to portray homelessness in a lifelike way like this, so that people can understand it from the point of view of those who lived (and are still living) it. The main character, Sugar, made it easy to connect with her character, as her acting was very real, and helps make her situation more real to the audience as a result. I was very moved by this film and all the characters in it. There were some moments that were so painful it was hard not to cry or feel like crying. If you have a soul, this film will touch you in ways you won't be prepared for. It's a film that everyone should see to understand what being homeless is like. Of course, everyone's experience is different and unique, so you can't base all experiences of homelessness on this one, but the story does show the dangers of street life, and why the best thing to do is to reach out for help and trust people even if that might seem an impossible task.

6305624,5,B00IZ4NHH6,"This movie touched me. I'm not homeless I have a job and a husband and a house and the dogs but that doesn't mean I have everything. I suffer from PTSD. I come from an alcoholic mother who still drinks to oblivion every day. I could've easily ended up on the streets. Everybody has different coping...mechanisms...this movie has reminded me that I don't cope well with what I've been thru but that I should still appreciate how far I've come. I laughed...cried and got pissed during the whole movie. It had me from the first scene...I very much believed all the actors and found myself wondering if this was a movie or really life for them. I didn't expect the ending. One part I did but the rest was...yeah. But I liked how it ended. It was brutal and honest.

6305633,2,B00IZ4NHH6,"I gave this an extra star because it is very well made.

I strongly disliked this movie because I think it glorifies and perpetuates this lifestyle rather than helping to prove the folly. I couldn't tell if the movie was supposed to explore the lifestyle or tell a story. If it's meant to explore the lifestyle it should be designed to dissuade rather than meh. Story-wise the plot is very weak.

The people are mostly portrayed with a level or positive outlook. While there are a few places in the country that have weather hospitable to this lifestyle I still don't buy it.",1453680000,,575,4.572815533980583

6305636,5,B00IZ4NHH6,"Wonderful movie. Filming, acting, editing, directing, script. It was very real though not raw. It made some of the aspects of street life more palatable for a wider audience while still being truthful. Street culture changes a bit from generation to generation but the basics are the same. Judgment exists everywhere I loved that it addressed the humanity that really mirrors the culture left behind in many ways. I'd like to think we are all more educated now and understand that there are valid reasons for someone to turn to something different. If there was some real oversight in foster care, social services, other family members involving themselves, maybe some of those reasons would not exist. Giving birth doesn't make one a parent, every animal does that. The family you choose and choose to be with you is more genuine and sometimes it happens to be biological. Sometimes not. I thought it might get into the PTSD a bit more.  It's certainly not just a male soldier or football player issue.  However,  the focus on  ""chosen family"" bonds, and the dysfunction and problems that still exist was very well done.  I thought the end was realistic in the way it brought home that no matter where you go...there you are. A change in location, that I have always been a fan of, doesn't change everything because you are just moving your same old self until that change is in you. It just changes the stage. Personally... sometimes you just need a break  The problem with the end is that an action seemed totally out of character in some ways, but that's what PTSD does. Triggers. Shenae was a wonderfully natural actress and seemed to understand her character very well.",1450483200,2,1675,4.778546712802768
6305637,4,B00IZ4NHH6,"Gritty film.  A fairly realistic look at what it's like to be young and homeless, the freedoms, the hardships, the ups and downs.  This definitely was not a feel good film right through to the ending but I'm glad I saw it.  It certainly didn't tie up any loose ends- I was left to wonder what happened with Ronnie.  And, of course, Sugar.",1450137600,,338,4.317460317460317

6305652,1,B00IZ4NHH6,"I think the topic of homeless teens is an important one to highlight and i felt compelled to watch this movie because I truly wanted to learn about Sugar's story and how she came to be a homeless teen. I didn't particularly like this movie however.  Someone else wrote is was more of a documentary-style....I think it was in the sense that it has no true plot.  Most of the film is just portraying what Sugar's day to day life is like on the streets.  It wasn't until about 50 minutes into the movie that you learn about her past and it was not really explored.  The movie also has a lot of foul language which is not surprising really and didn't bother me all that much but it could bother other people.  The acting wasn't great and overall I didn't think any of the characters were all that likable.  I don't know if its because they weren't that believable.  The only two characters I sympathized with was Sketch and Ronnie.  The others just seemed very unwilling to try and better their lives.  There were people trying to offer help and most of the characters, including Sugar, just cursed at them and seemed annoyed to be bothered.  It just was annoying to see.  The ending was horrible. possible SPOILER- why did she do that?  I didn't get it....there was no good conclusion.  It sucked.  The end.  Don't waste your time.

6305680,3,B00IZ4NHH6,"This review may contain spoilers ***

I was motivated to view this film to resonate with a personal experience attempting a rescue of a young adult from this situation. Talking to many helpful folks in area, who take their care seriously, it appears to be a very supportive environment. However, when you travel through these streets and see how dire the living conditions are, the appearance of these kids all dirt, grime, and resigned to their fate, this film lacks such perspective. For in this production you see much humor, camaraderie, hip clothes, and an ambiance that defies a bare minimum existence.

I think the constant negative response to someone trying to help, be it a counselor who has been there or a boyfriend who cares, becomes tiresome time after time. If that individual is so well versed at crafting a new existence, deception becomes their greatest and most profound ally. Going deep inside and making believe is a survival instinct that most of us experienced with great trauma are accustomed. I think the treatment of the process of healing is never dealt with properly. Sometimes the can of worms in Pandora's box is overwhelming and best dealt with in obsequious methods. Simply having a family member showing up, convincing it's time to come home and addressing them by their real name is likely ineffective.

Who recovers from this experience? Someone very lucky indeed who has the mental and emotional capacity to appreciate help. They still long for the anonymity and free style lack of accounting, but life is pretty much a trade-off for security.

High recommend for those who might interact with Venice homeless and decide that spare change for food is most appreciated.",1428624000,7,1704,4.968421052631579

I admit that I wanted a storybook ending, which this movie definitely does not give, but even though the ending stays true to the storyline, I'm still left feeling hopeful. All in all, this is a poignantly sad movie, but I really enjoyed watching it.",1422489600,,362,4.584615384615384

6305692,1,B00IZ4NHH6,I found this film to be poorly acted. I actually got a feeling of over acting from the female lead which came across as disingenuous. I could ' feel' the acting.,1420416000,,161,4.225806451612903
6305693,4,B00IZ4NHH6,Great movie. I read someone else's review that suggested that this would make a great series for cable or network TV. I couldn't agree more. It would be compelling drama to really delve into each characters background and how they ended up on the streets.,1419897600,,255,4.688888888888889

6305699,4,B00IZ4NHH6,This is a movie I would not usually watch as the language is inappropriate. Normally I would turn it off. But is a true story & the language is part of the truth. It was very educational to me in helping me to understand and have empathy for people I know nothing about. So in spite of the language I recommend it.,1418083200,,314,4.080645161290323
6305700,4,B00IZ4NHH6,"this is a good movie and it is well made.  I found the story troubling, at best - the music - the same.  There are a lot of things that are troubling about this movie.  But, this is an emotional story - and it's well done.  It is very sad -  people can be very judgmental but they have never been in the shoes that these kids have been in.  The thing is, that these are children, and this movie clearly shows that children have to face very difficult life situations and they aren't exactly equipped to deal with the pain and loss that they have had to deal with.  People have allowed their prejudices to get in the way of having any love and concern for these people.  Things can happen, and anyone could find themselves in this situation.  I'm sure this girl never thought she'd end up there, but then all of a sudden her family was gone.  I found it difficult to watch, but something in me kept wanting to watch it.  It's a good movie, and 4 stars is a good rating from me.  It didn't get 5 stars because I think there are some things that could have been improved upon, but it is a decent movie.  A little too much bad language and sex for me, but that helps it be real - that's the reality of her situation.",1417046400,,1212,4.1063829787234045
6305701,3,B00IZ4NHH6,Filthy language I got past it to see the story. It turned out to be a good teacher tool.,1416441600,,88,3.6842105263157894
6305702,4,B00IZ4NHH6,Great movie ..Shenae Grimes should have recieved an oscar nomination for this movie..i would rate her performance alone 5 stars..i gave the movie as a whole 4 stars because i felt that some of the actors with her wasn't matched well with her level of acting skills from a scale od 1 to 10 shw was a 12 but somw of her costars were between 3-5..if that makes sense,1416441600,,363,4.27536231884058
6305703,5,B00IZ4NHH6,"This movie is very well written, filmed and the acting is outstanding, the verbal exchanges and physical interaction of the youth in this movie is very natural. Language is course but that is the way teens talk, there is violence, drug use and sex but no nudity and these themes are ancillary. While the movie depicts the grungy, hand to mouth existence of these street kids and is at times incredibly sad it is not heavily moralistic nor does it glorify life in the streets, it is a convincing and realistic portrait of a group of friends living on the streets of Venice, CA",1416355200,5,575,4.538461538461538

captures a glimpse into the life of those living on the streets of Venice Beach.
As all dramas, it romanticises the life but also shows some harsh realities like drug od's, crime, abuse, etc.",1412035200,,240,5.025
6305713,4,B00IZ4NHH6,"This movie is gorgeously shot and very moving. I enjoyed it because it shows a side to a life that defies certain stereotypes and it shows that people are people no matter where they are in life. To address the review stating that it is unrealistic that someone on the streets could be attractive or have a vocabulary, I say that it is an easy prejudice to assume that looks and intelligence only exist for people that live in homes. It's absurd to believe that only people that have the opportunity to show a gift possess a gift. The truth is that in a lot of cases, creativity is born out of adversity and pain. There are circumstances that I can't begin to understand that could lead someone to the streets. It isn't a rule that they have to be ugly, stupid or shallow to be there. Life happens. Though I've never been on the street and hope I never am, who is to say that I am in better than someone who is? But, I digress. My point is that this movie does a brilliant job of humanizing something that so often gets ignored or is looked at with only negativity. While I'm not fond of the language, I loved the message...that you can find love anywhere, you can find connections to people and no matter where you are- you matter.",1411257600,34,1232,4.314655172413793
6305714,5,B00IZ4NHH6,"I found this movie to be a very good look at the life of a girl on the streets. In my opinion I take from the movie that she is running away from something that happened in the past (I said it that way as not to spoil those reading this). It says in the description of the movie that she has PTSD, from what happened to her. I do have PTSD my self and it is very hard to deal with it at times, I see it in her as well.
I have to say that I have worked with the homeless population for 14 years, and you see many different people. There are those who sleep at friends houses and hop from house to house as well as some who have been living on the streets or in their cars. (One person had said on here that the movie is unrealistic, and the fact in the movie that the kids have good teeth and are good looking in their opinion). There are those who are homeless that are the same as those in the movie not all homeless people look like bums some do find a way to take care of themselves, I got from the movie that Sugar does find a way to take care of herself.

I do recommend this movie to anyone. (read the synopsis of the movie is says a lot)",1411171200,11,1144,3.827004219409283
