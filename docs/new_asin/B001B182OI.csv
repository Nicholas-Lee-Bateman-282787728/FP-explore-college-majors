3478584,1,B001B182OI,"This movie is,absolutely terrible. One of the worst movies ever. Comparable to Day of the Dead 2 Contagium, and House 2 The Second Story. Except much much worse. This movie was  so bad HBO wouldn't even play it on their own network, and they owned the film. That is terrible. Part 1 and 2 were very well done. If you are expecting this one to be like the previous ones, you will be very disappointed. Skip this one all together, and pretend it doesn't exist. Maybe another one will come out to redeem the series.",1441065600,5,512,4.389473684210526

3478586,5,B001B182OI,The only reason I gave the pool vac. A bad rating is because it was not compatible with my pool.,1434412800,,96,3.85
3478587,3,B001B182OI,"Not as good as the first two, Maybe I'll have to watch it again to see if my opinion changes.",1432512000,,93,3.7
3478588,5,B001B182OI,"Good addition to complete the Creepshow trilogy. Different writers, but lives up to the satirical humor started by King and Romero in the original movie shorts. The kicker is this particular set of short stories crosses over each other for a freaky fun ending.",1386633600,3,260,4.931818181818182
3478589,3,B001B182OI,"Creepshow III does not have any real horror in the movie. It is light with irony and twists. The independent stories intertwine in a nice way to add to the humor. Okay, the special effects were not special. At the end of the first episode (mini-plot spoiler) a girl named Alice is changed into a white rabbit. I think the box description as ""merrily macabre fun"" is apt for the movie. There is no suspense or terror. It is a horror movie for people who don't like horror movies because they are too intense.

PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bomb, deals with prostitution and drugs. No nudity.",1343606400,,578,4.5576923076923075
3478610,4,B001B182OI,"It took that third opus a long time to get out, twenty years mind you. Its nearly an afterthought: how can such two good successful films by Stephen King and George Romero be continued twenty years later? First because the period during which the title was controlled exclusively by the first author and director must have come to its end, liberating the title, otherwise it should have been attached to the original proprietors and paid for.

But it is hard to go back to the concept of these Creepshows and some changes have to be introduced. The very first change is that there is some continuity in the whole film because some actors and their roles go from one episode to the next or the one after the next. Some situations too are similar or even the same, not to speak of some objects like cars.

The next change is the style. This film really targets the grossest effects we can imagine. Gross is not necessarily bad but in this case it is done without much finesse and from gross we move to sickening and that is the lowest level in horror stories or movies according to Stephen King himself. And along that line the director does not hesitate to introduce human beings who suddenly turn into very monstrous beings that can resuscitate after having been killed, resuscitate to haunt a living drug-addicted doctor for example, etc.

And of course the concept of a mad scientist or technician is introduced with no real delicacy. The story of his wife  real or not real  Frankenstein or simple aging lustful old man  and how she ends up in a microwave oven is just plain funny. It was supposed to be a prank at first and it ran out to be a slaughterhouse scene with so much blood we just wonder if it is not half a dozen wives and not only one. And at the end the mad scientist marries her finally but this time it is so openly a recomposed body that there is no doubt at all any more. We are dealing with Doctor Frankenstein, middle name Lego, playing with body parts as if they were some press-in parts, pieces and pawns.

We definitely are not in a comic strip adventure for a young teenager, male preferably, but for some older teenagers, male as well as female, or whatever gender they may decide to have, trying to experience some disquieting experience that is supposed to make their stomach growl and their intestine dance some frantic tarantella from their waist to their groin, though it remains rather soft and bashful at this lower level.

Enjoy the film, but after a light dinner if you do not want to have some accident generally attributed to airsickness in a plane or road-sickness in a bus or a car. And be sure you take a sleeping pill afterwards to avoid all kinds of nightmares.

3478613,1,B001B182OI,"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Definitely the worse ""Horror Anthology"" films I've ever seen and trust me, they're some bad ones out there. How movies like this get green-lit and/or funded by anyone is beyond me.",1492732800,,240,4.4772727272727275

3478615,1,B001B182OI,"This never should have been made. Apparently if you take creep show out of the 80s and subtract Stephen King, it looks like a group of kids made a home video...",1489017600,4,160,4.193548387096774
3478616,2,B001B182OI,I went into this movie with high hopes but was kind of let down. This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time . It would have been better if it wasn't trying to be funny . Its not bad as in Friday the 13th Jason takes manhatten where its good.. No its just pretty bad. Maybe if I watch it more I can learn to like it,1485561600,,320,3.585714285714286
3478617,1,B001B182OI,"Nothing wrong with the quality, but it just isn't as awesome as the other two.",1484179200,,78,4.266666666666667
3478618,1,B001B182OI,A good movie title but bad movie nothing to do with 1&2 it's more like trick r treat . No creature storyteller and barley scary i watched it once and forgotten about the story to this one it was so bad it is up there  with popcorn the movie. Beware it's so scary cause they ripped off the name  and gave us a b horror movie yawn  go watch 1 &2  not this death trap no wonder it was straight to home video .,1473984000,,406,3.7976190476190474
3478619,1,B001B182OI,"As a fan of the first two ""Creepshow"" films, this movie was actually painful to watch. I'm shocked that they were even able to license the title ""Creepshow""?

I love anthology horror films, and even like some of the new titles like ""V/H/S"" or ""ABC's of Death"". Growing up watching ""Tales from the Darkside"", ""Monsters"", ""Freddy's Nightmares"" and of course the original ""Creepshow"" films, I've seen most of the horror anthology films out there, and I can say without a doubt, this is the absolute WORST.

I think that if you dig deep enough, there are nuggets of some decent stories in here, but you would have to dig very, very deep. To top it off, the tepid stories are done no favors by the execution. The acting, direction, the score, the animation...it's all awful.

Honestly there is nothing redeeming here, avoid this film even out of curiosity.",1473897600,,851,4.736486486486487
3478620,1,B001B182OI,"Please do yourself a favor and skip this turd.  It's nothing more than a low budget, poorly produced anthology ""horror"" movie that tries to capitalize off the ""Creepshow"" name.  I won't get into the specifics but I speak to the ""Creepshow"" fans like myself, that this movie is just badly produced.  There's not much to like, except it doesn't have anything in common with the iconic cryptkeeper we remember in the first two films.  It's an independent film that clearly didn't have a good direction to supervise it, between the acting and the lack of story.",1473638400,,557,4.770833333333333

3478624,2,B001B182OI,"I watched Creepshow 3 recently for the first time and it looks like I'm probably one of the few that thought it was okay. Not great, not comparable in any way to the first two but I've seen plenty worse. The gore was pretty good and the stories all tie in together. I thought The Professor was played well and the homeless street vendor guy was hilarious.",1463702400,,355,4.313432835820896

3478629,1,B001B182OI,"If your a fan of Creepshow 1 & 2, skip this one.  Remember the way THE CRATE or THE RAFT horrified you?  Nothing like that here...  Not even sure I should call this horror.  A weak addition to an awesome anthology horror series.  In the making of featurette, the director even has the balls to say this is the best written one of the three movies!  Stephen King and George Romero helmed the first 2 movies...  And this dude claims his is better written.  Don't waste your time.",1451692800,21,477,4.340909090909091

8281052,1,B001B182OI,I can see why Creepshow 3 wasn't put on Blu-ray cause HBO didn't keep the same aspects of the original. HBO must have bought the rights to Creepshow and did not keep to the original of Creepshow 1 and 2. So cause of this it ruined the effect of the movie.,1521763200,,255,4.019607843137255
