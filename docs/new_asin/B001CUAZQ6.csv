8289609,4,B001CUAZQ6,"This is must viewing for any student of presidential leadership, the role of presidential staff and colleagues, and how wars can slowly escalate into an abyss.  This video shows some of the behind the scenes torment a president can experience as they make decisions to send a country to war. It is also a stark lesson in how advisors, congressional colleagues, public opinion, and the ever-present fear of criticism shapes policies, especially policies as important as war or peace.

The video does reenactments of LBJ discussions inside the White House, Pentagon, Congress, and in the field. These frank, sometimes painful, conversations give a rare look into the calculus made to enter the Vietnam War, one small decision at a time.  With hindsight, the viewer will inevitably make observations on when LBJ should have just stopped, but the documentary is excellent in displaying how the underlying theme of ""just this one next step will solve the problem"" was so woefully wrong.

The documentary is narrated by Frank Sesno, and covers the period between the death of JFK and the LBJ decision to escalate US involvement in Vietnam in the summer of 1965.  This is an excellent documentary for any student of how the US entered the Vietnam War, and why we found it so difficult to get out.  It allows the viewer to draw parallels between LBJ in 1964-1965 and GWB in 2003-2005. It is a good companion to the feature film, ""Path to War"" (2003) with Alec Baldwin as Robert McNamara.",1367020800,,1479,4.872509960159363
