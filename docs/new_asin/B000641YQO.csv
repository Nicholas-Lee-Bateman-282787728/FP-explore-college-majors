2165106,2,B000641YQO,"I have been collecting the Wolf's Rain DVDs, so naturally when this volume came out I rushed and bought it on the day of its release.  However, this all ended in disappointment when I found that I... basically already own this disc.  My previous discs essentially contain the same episodes that are recapped on this disc.  If you have been a Wolf's Rain collector up to this point... be forewarned that you already own these episodes.  I would only suggest buying this DVD for the collector's value, but be forewarned that the storyline does not progress at all here.",1103068800,12,567,4.696969696969697
2165107,2,B000641YQO,"The episodes on this disc are 'recap' episodes, summarising the the contents of the previous three discs.  There is little or no new content here. This is because Bones, the Japanese studio making the show, was running out of money, so they needed to do some low budget episodes using already-made video. Thus the four recap episodes were inserted into the series.  Also note that volume 5 is being released only three weeks after this one, as opposed to the customary two months for Bandai titles.",1099180800,14,498,4.77906976744186
2165108,5,B000641YQO,"After an interlude of developing some of the side charactors, this volumne gets back into the main journey of the pack.  Finally, we get to see some of the long awaited former life of Kiba and how his journey began.  Interesting charactor developement proceeds on the rest of the pack...especially on Tsume, and Tolboy faces a crises in which he snaps.

I was a bit somber on Volumne 3.  Hubb (the detective), his ex-wife, Cher, and Quint (the wolf hunter) are very interesting charactors, but it's truly Kiba, Tsume, Hige and Tolboy (and the flower maiden, Cheza) that have truly driven this story.  Not to mention, Blue, who we begin to see in ways we have never seen before.  The tention and the story really begin to build in Volumne 4...as well as the new developements.  Has Kiba truly found paridise?  What has really happened to Homina (Lord Darsha's love who has been stricken by Paridise).  And above all that, enter the most vile of villens...the nobel behind the mysery of all...Jagera

The only other thing I can add is just wait for Volumne 5!  Volumne 4 is the build up to the climax, but I guarentee every episode in Volumne 5 will have you cheering, crying, or wishing to step through the screen to throttle the villeness Jagera.

This is one of the most unique anime series ever produced.  If you like something very different, with some of the best story telling ever written, some of the best sound track music (Yes, there are some new tracks in this volumne, and Yoko Kanno continues to top herself), and some of the best anime ever contained within a television series, Wolf's Rain is a must.  Studio Bones (also producers of Cowboy Bebop)is truly one of the most ground breaking anime groups ever!

One last request to Studio Bones...please...please don't do to Kiba and the pack what you did to Spike at the end of the Cowboy Bebop series!!!  Also...Please make a feature film of Wolf's Rain (Like the Cowboy Bebop movie...not just a re-hash!)",1095984000,18,1967,4.674418604651163
2165129,4,B000641YQO,"If you've been following along this series by DVD, as I have, episodes 15 thru 18 will be something of a disappointment.  They are a reprise of the story up to this point, and nothing more.  That might work for the TV audience, for which much time has passed, but for someone who just watched the third DVD last week it's an unexpected delay in an otherwise compelling series.

There are a few extra insights here, but most of what you will see is excerpts from the previous episodes.  The continuity is well done, and the effect is something like a four episode special, but at the end you will be right were you were at the end of episode 14.  If your just renting and watching then you could easily skip this DVD and go right on to the fifth.

If you are buying than you will have to wrestle with your compulsion for completeness.  If you have none go directly to five without a further thought.  If you are compulsive buy it, but be prepared to feel faintly cheated.  Or you could buy it and wait 6 months before viewing it in order to get the intended effect.

Since the first episodes were excellent this DVD is just as good, and the focus on only the key moments makes you more aware of the music, which is in a class by itself.  Truly, This is probably the first time I've told people that something was really good but that they shouldn't buy it.  Go figure.",1111881600,10,1367,4.276264591439689
2165130,1,B000641YQO,"Signs that you are about to make a bad purchase.  1 star is the highest rating. I of course didn't read anything. I saw the show on Cartoon Network and immediately ran to Best Buy to purchase every DVD available in the series.  Funny thing is, there was a gap in the display where volume 4 would've been.  I shuffled through the box covers and found a 4th different cover.  Finding no other volumes I took to register took the dvds home, only to find out I had purchased volume 1,2,3,and 5???? watched 1-3 immediatley.  Can't break continuity, must proceed to another store to buy volume  4. Get to store and hmm...Volume 4 Recollections???? Okay maybe they have 1 recap episode, it happens.  Get home look at back of box.  This is the same description on volume 2???  And my soul was consumed as I broke the seal rendering the disc completely unreturnable and discovered the awful truth that THIS WAS A 4 EPISODE RECAP OF THE PREVIOUS 14 EPISODES.  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH AAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  OWW OWWW  AAAAAARRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.  Release the hounds of hell on the ones responsible for this abomination.  The show is great. If you want to be cheap just buy this disc instead of the first three, though you will lose the soul of the story.  You have been forwarned.",1107648000,6,1321,4.968036529680365
2165131,1,B000641YQO,"No new material, just a recap of things already seen.  A complete waste of money.  Interestingly, the description on the back was exactly the same as vol. 2 .  Maybe they were trying to send a warning.  If you can find a way to get your money back, do so.",1106611200,5,255,4.04
2165132,1,B000641YQO,"I know the title of this volume of Wolf's Rain is ""Recollections"", but Bandai has went a little overboard. I expect at least one or two episodes in an anime series to be a recap but here we have an ENTIRE DVD, 4 EPISODES of recycled material from past shows!!!! There is nothing new here. Even the infamous last 2 episodes of Evangelion didn't go so far as this and they were running out of money. What is the excuse here? To pay 20$ for an entire dvd of stuff I've already seen. It's almost like they were making one of those awful anime movies where an entire 26 episode series is squeezed into 2 hours. There should have been a warning on the dvd box that there is no new material contained in it. It makes me want to write to Bandai and demand my money back. If you have been following Wolf's Rain since the first volume, definately skip this volume. You'll be wasting your money.

I would recommend Miami Guns Episode 2, which parodies recap shows by having one after only one episode of the show.",1105747200,6,1002,4.301587301587301
2165133,1,B000641YQO,"I finished the DVD in 5 min. Bandai, this is a total disgrace. I can undestand if we are in Japan and the production is running slow on the weekly program and these episode are padded in. Or 1-2 episodes are used to add more info with recap. But to inlude these in the US release is just shameful! IF YOU ALREADY OWN DISC 1-3 (I assume you do, otherwise you would not be interested in this one?), save your money and proceed to disc 5!",1105315200,5,435,4.069767441860465
2165134,1,B000641YQO,Absolutely no excuse for this DVD except to rip off fans of this anime.  Save your money and avoid Volume 4!,1104796800,4,108,4.142857142857143
2165135,1,B000641YQO,"Unless you are one of those people (like me) who run out and buy every disk of a series you like right when it comes out, please just save your money.  This disk is a complete dissapointment, and I'm sorry that I spent money on it.  I waited and waited to get it only to find out that it's entirely flashbacks!  I can understand one recap episode to sum things up, but four? No, thank you.  It won't stop me from getting the next one though, it's a fantastic series, i just hope that there's new stuff on the next disk ^_^",1104278400,14,522,4.088235294117647
2165136,1,B000641YQO,"So i finish disc 3, pop in disc 4 ready for more action...suddenly i'm watching disc 1 again. except disc 1 is in its case.

there was no reason to even have this so called recollection disc. real lame now i gotta wait for disc 5 to arrive in the mail.",1104105600,10,252,3.9411764705882355
2165137,3,B000641YQO,"I rented this with high expectations but ended up stopping it halfway through.  I had no idea that the disc would be a complete recap of the previous action.  Thus my hopes for a new plot twist or perhaps some explanations for many of the mysteries in the series were dashed.

Don't get me wrong - I love this series.  The artwork is fantastic and the soundtrack inspired (thank god for Yoko Kanno - she is hands down my favorite anime composer today).  But there is so much to be explored in this story!  I'm very disappointed that Studio Bones wasted 4 hours of critical plot development time to a recap.  Perhaps it was money related - I don't know the details.  What I do know is that as a fan of this series, I wish that these episodes could have been used to develop the story rather than just throwing in old animation.

Bottom line: If you've not watched any of the previous episodes, you could get this DVD and catch up on the story in only 4 episodes as opposed to 12.  But who'd want to?",1103760000,21,998,4.26063829787234
2165138,1,B000641YQO,This is a great anime series but if you have the first 3 disc then there is absolutley no reason to purchase this dvd. I only wish that there had been some type of warning on the cover that this was a recap dvd. I give this dvd 1 star because I feel ripped off!,1103500800,11,261,3.7636363636363637
8038026,4,B000641YQO,forgot to write this review months ago.  everything was great thank you,1496448000,,71,4.916666666666667

8038028,5,B000641YQO,"This disk does not represent the series as a whole since they are just recap episodes which help explain and develop the characters after what happened at Darcia's keep.

Hope, friendship, adventure, love, forgiveness, compassion, Paradise, all words that leave a subtle nostalgia upon watching Wolf's Rain; mere words cannot hope to come close to truly describing this anime. When I first saw a Wolf's Rain poster it seemed like an 'interesting' show to watch; but as I watched the first episode, then the second, then the third, and fourth, and fifth, then beyond, my initial impression of 'interesting' was drastically changed. From the first moment when you hear one of our main protagonists, Kiba, narrate the opening scene and hear the beautiful musical score behind the voice, it makes you feel as if you personally know the characters and you feel all the human emotions and struggles they go through their journey. In Wolf's Rain, Kiba is trying to find Paradise, a place that only wolves can open. However wolves were hunted down by humans and had extinct for over 200 years....needless to say being a wolf isn't exactly an option. So wolves adapted to human form and walked among humans. Upon reaching the city, Kiba tries to find the flower maiden named Cheza who can lead the wolves to Paradise. Little did Kiba know that in the city he would find more than a scent of the flower maiden; here he would find Hige, a wolf with a carefree spirit, Tsume, also a wolf with a bad-boy attitude that seems to have a haunted past, and Toboe, the youngest in the group who's sweet naive innocent ties them, and together these unlikely personalities come to form an unbreakable tie as progress on their journey to find Paradise. Their antagonists are Darcia, a man haunted by a curse and the loss of his beloved Hamona, and Quent who is a drunk, broken man convinced wolves took his happiness and family away. Yet while as antagonists their characters are very excellently developed, and while their actions are terrible and inexcusable at times, you understand them unlike other series where the explanation towards the villain or antagonist is brief or they are just so.

A great attribution about Kiba, Tsume, Hige, and Toboe, that while having different personalities and characters, all possess human emotions and through their journey, help heal each other and relive them of their burdens and sadness that they all carried. This, for lack of a better world, 'anime' gives a hope that while we might not find Paradise on earth, it shouldn't stop us from looking. You never know since along the way you might find unlikely people who show you what true friendship is. Then we can can all know the true meaning of Wolf's Rain is.",1309824000,,2735,4.804670912951168
8038029,3,B000641YQO,"Yes, this volume is a recap, and people are warned.  My understanding was that it was necessary in the telling of the series to a television audience in Japan as the outbreak of SARS necessitated a halt in production for several months.  So, don't get this unless you're a hardcore fan, but an understanding of why these four recap episodes were released hopefully ameliorates some of the harsh criticism leveled at volume four of Wolf's Rain.  I would only recommend it to a dedicated fan of the series who wants to watch the entirety of the show including these recap episodes which include a bare minimum of additional character development.  This is why the Adult Swim airing of the series omitted episodes 15-18.",1223596800,4,717,4.804878048780488
8038030,1,B000641YQO,"This DVD is more well known as the infamous recap volume and that's basically all it is. All 4 episodes on this DVD are recaps of the events of the previous DVDs, there's nothing new in this volume at all.

You could simply skip this volume and go straight to 5 and you'd be fine, there's no additional story in this volume, only reason to really pick it up is to complete your collection.",1204416000,,389,4.256756756756757
8038031,1,B000641YQO,"I understand that some fans would like to see more of their loved characters (this series is one of the best as far as I'm concerned), and I can understand the need in filling in a gap especually if the show hasn't been aired in a while on TV: but I cannot understand ANYONE who buys this DVD for ANY reason.

You do not need this DVD to ""fill the gap in your collection."" They did the same thing with Chobits in episode 7, another damn recap. There's no point in watching it. The series is great, stick to the episodes both before and after this DVD.

Trust me, I know how tempting it is to either rent this episode, get it on NetFlix, or go out and buy it outright... but don't. You'll only be sorry. There are a myriad of reasons why the company made this DVD (posted elsewhere) but what's important is that it is a waste of time and money.

Great series (A+), This DVD = F.",1131408000,4,877,4.116959064327485
8038032,2,B000641YQO,"Ok, I like this series, buy honestly, it did not need four recap episodes in a row.  The naration doesn't give any new insightsor reveal anything about the plot.  If I had known that I would have bought this disk last, if at all.",1125100800,4,229,4.181818181818182
8038033,1,B000641YQO,"What happened?  Instead of continuing on with this fantastic series, the animators decided to use one whole DVD volume to recap all events up to this point.  Did someone in the production team realize that the series was going to be one DVD short in filling up the box set & they decided to remedy that?

Get Vol. 4 ONLY if you have short term memory issues or like looooooooong flashbacks.  Otherwise skip to Volume 5, you'll be glad you did.",1124496000,4,443,4.432098765432099
8038034,1,B000641YQO,"I was disappointed in this volume. In the first episode, Tsume's recollection, it was practically the entire first episode replayed. I would have liked to see some more in-depth monologue (thoughts) around the emotional aspect of what the characters were going through as they recalled them. There was a little of this but it could have been much better thought out vol 4. I feel this was a missed opportunity for some indepth character development. The characters are so rich,it is a shame. The episode mantage (as i'll call these ""recollections"")I felt that was best put together was Hige's. I wish they had new schenes or angels that were part of the recalled events,new sequences at the very least. This would have served the same intention (to summarize the story thus far) but would have added a deeper dimension to the characters. Fortunatlly I rented this whole series before I decided to buy it.  I came across volume three first, thinking it was a stand alone movie. (I was in a hurry.)Oh course I was completely lost. Clearly this was the climax of the series. So I returned to begin from Volume one. When I got to this volume I was shocked. I spead through it, partly fast forwarding. Waiting for any thing new!  Nothing but a piece of dialouge or two! What a waste! And at $18.00-40.00 volume, don't bother!  I'll only buy this if I find it in the greatly reduced bin for $5.00 or less!  Thank you reviewers for your warnings!  Bandai,why did you cheat us like this?!!",1115337600,3,1481,4.659003831417625
8038035,2,B000641YQO,"Well, This dvd is pretty bad, like everyone else said. It's 4 episodes recapping the previous 14, with narration from each character in the background. I believe they had to make these eps due to the fact that they needed to save some money in japan since they weren't getting high ratings on the anime series. Anyway, I didn't buy this dvd, because I have the japanese box set instead, which saved me a lot of $$. I watched each episode, and I must say the only part I liked was the opening and ending theme. Other than that, there really is no need to buy this dvd unless you are truly a die-hard wolf's rain fan. But, don't be surprised if you watch this dvd for 5 minutes and then throw it out the window. I really highly recommend renting this before you buy it, cause otherwise you are wasting your money.",1114560000,2,811,4.30718954248366
