It is billed as offensive and funny...it is neither. If my foot
had been caught in a bear trap and I was force to watch this movie or chew my foot off...I would cheerfully chew off my foot to

1936396,1,B0000E69JE,"Bought the Underground Comedy Movie Unrated Edition. I wanted to get a good laugh at some ""offensive"" humor. This movie straight up sucks. Doesn't even deserve 1 star (but theres no option lower!). I don't know what they were thinking. I actually threw it away after I burned it with my lighter. I watched it one time and I couldn't believe how incredibly dumb it was. I started watching it again to see if I missed something, but no, nothing even worth my time. I felt bad because I wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this horrible excuse for a movie. It's almost as if they didn't even try to make a product that would sell. To describe the quality - like a junior high school film class project gone really, really bad. I couldn't wait to get online and write as many reviews as possible to try to warn people about this.  I was sure I would get SOME entertainment out of it, but since I couldn't get my money back, destroying the DVD was my only option. Burned really well....I'm very disappointed....",1072828800,8,1008,4.448648648648649
1936397,1,B0000E69JE,"This is the WORST movie i have ever bought. I thought it was going to be funny, so i bought it at Tower Records. God. It was supposed to be the most offensive movie ever and very funny. It was hardly offensive and rarely funny. I don't understand what other people are talking about. I mean, I'm a person who laughs at EVERYTHING. And there's nothing more than i want to have 1) never seen this movie and 2) my money back. I have to give it a little credit for its ""Dickman"" skit, as well as some minor amusement from the ""Godmother"" and japanese porn movie skits, but this was really just a terrible thing. The infomercials lied... If you don't believe me, trick someone you hate into buying it, then watch it with them. OR, buy it off me. In fact, you can have it. I hate it so much.

UPDATE: FALL, 2004:
I showed this to a bunch of people in college, letting them know it was a terrible movie. Some forced laughs, but otherwise, didn't entertain anyone. Tried to give it away, no one would take it. Eventually just left it in a random room at some party. Hope that doesn't hurt my karma.",1072742400,13,1090,4.240384615384615

It's funny as hell although I would strongly suggest getting the ""Unrated"" version.  The trailer that you see on Comedy Central is mild compared to the movie. Slash is brilliant as the Host of ""The Bag Lady Pageant"" and Michael Clarke Duncan is great as the ""Gay Virgin"".  This is sure to be a classic.  Peace out!",1068854400,13,433,4.308641975308642

There's a superhero called Dickman who fights the lesbian community and the ""Watt's Up"" talk show is historical.  I have to recommend this movie however the movie is not for everybody and is very offensive if you can't laugh at the jokes.  So if you can laugh at yourself and don't mind the offensive nature, I strongly recommend it.  Oh yea, great for parties!",1068768000,11,492,4.741176470588235

1936441,4,B0000E69JE,"This is a movie that requires a certain somewhat twisted sense of the absurd to appreciate. Even then it's a bit of a stretch to call it anything but infantile. For the most part I actually enjoyed it - something very, very few other people do. As to the films ability to 'offend' everyone - I have seen much worse crap in movies (even so-called main stream movies) and this movie doesn't so much offend as just plain old bore you to tears at times. If you've ever lived in Los Angeles, know the song 'I Love LA' by Randy Newman and want a good laugh then this movie is worth the couple of bucks just to see that skit. Would I recommend this movie? Probably not to my Mom but to pretty much anyone who would be reading this in the first place then a resounding yes.

There's a alot of dumb comedy skits, but for the most part if you don't like bum fights, nepolean dynamite, or jackass type humor. you are not going to like this. So buyer beware. See if someone you know is into this stuff and talk them into buying it, then you watch it with them and if you hate it, you are not out any money.",1181865600,,450,3.902173913043478
1936444,1,B0000E69JE,"This movie is so terrible. I like some movies that are extremely low-budget and that aren't considered by most to be funny or otherwise good, but I couldn't even get through a half hour of this garbage. Some people have said that they got ONE laugh out of it, but I couldn't find anything even remotely funny about this film, if you could even call it that. It claims to be ""offensive"", but the movie is so dumb that anyone who could see it as such would likely disregard any lack of tact as mere stupidity. Don't even rent this...take your 3 bucks and buy a couple of those $1 movies from Wal-Mart. I promise you they'll be better than this.",1159401600,2,642,4.31404958677686
1936445,1,B0000E69JE,"This movie is just not funny.  It's not shocking, edgy, or offensive. It's just stupid.  In the credits, it says something about the producers of ""There's Something About Mary"" ripping this movie off. Nothing in ""There's Something About Mary"" reminded me of this ""movie"" in the slightest.  Maybe they stole the funny parts and didn't give them back, and that's why we're left with this unfunny non-movie.  I'll admit that my sense of humor is very low-brow, immature, and childish, but I still didn't even laugh once.  Not a chuckle.  Not even a titter. There is no way that any human being could find this ""movie"" funny or entertaining in any way. Don't be deceived by the one star in my rating.  It's not even worth one star, I just didn't have the option of picking anything lower.  Don't make the same mistake I made.  There's 1.5 hours of my life that I wasted and I'll never have back.

1936446,3,B0000E69JE,"Completely forget what's on the cover of this film... the actress' it shows have about 2 minute's on screen time, Slash has a pathetic role for one scene, and Michael Clark Duncan's gay/virgin scenes are not funny. Plus, I was never offended at anything.

From my understanding after seeing this, it seems to be a reunion show of some cable access show that they did in 1988 or something.

It's kind of a sketch comedy movie along the lines of Kentucky Fried Movie, but it's not. This movie does have a few laughs and hysterical moments, but a few scenes don't work. Like the guy who is trying to be Arnold Schwarzenegger who sounds more like Jaun Claude Vanne Damm... his scenes should have been one scene, not showing a teaser bit for it in between other scenes before it was shown who he was talking to (if you've seen this film, you'll know what I mean)

A few things don't work at all, but yet, there are also things that didn't work in KFM but that didn't stop it from being a classic. I'm defiantly not saying this movie is going to be a classic, far from it... but it it is good to see a new movie of this kind where it's just for fun and not for awards.

Where else this movie fails is repeating things. It shows the same situation repeated, but instead of being noticeably different, it almost just seems like the had 40 minute's of footage when the cut the film, and to extend it they put in the alternate takes... even one of the Michael Clark Duncan scenes show them laughing at the end of it, and I think i think that was them really laughing doing an improve.

Mostly it's the lack of more scenes, and repeating or showing the alternate take that makes this movie suffer from being a great movie. But, it is only an independent one, it is funny enough for me to say rent it. But, I guess everyone's taste is different, 'cause a lot of reviewers say they hate it... however, they may just all be the same person standing around a subway sewer grinding into it.

It's OK, it's not perfect, it's not great, but hell, it's better then that pathetic Groove Tube.",1122508800,3,2072,4.341085271317829
1936447,1,B0000E69JE,"Oh, lordy.

I bought this movie after seeing it at Media Play and remembering the late-night commercial.  After getting totally into recent Troma movies, I figured this would be a good addition to the ""offensive, f'ed up"" movie collection.  I was wrong.  Dead wrong.  I'm not even half-way through this movie, just getting to the Dickman skit, and I'm writing this review.  Please don't buy this movie.

First of all, I wasn't offended.  Granted, it's hard to offend me.  But I can't imagine very much in this movie that would offend anyone.

Second, the movie is just not funny.  Nothing in this movie is funny.  Really.  Absolutely nothing.  You'll see somewhat graphic violence.  You'll see some gratuituous female nudity.  You'll see celebrity cameos.  You'll see a lot of things that the makers of this movie thought would be funny.  But unfortunately, they forgot to write jokes around them.  Was anything in this movie even trying to be funny?  It's really hard to tell.  Ultimately, all you'll really see in this movie is your hard-earned money being flushed down the drain.

Again, please don't make the same mistake I did.  Please don't buy this movie.  Don't even watch this movie.  You might be tempted just because of all the bad reviews you'll read here saying how bad it is.  But don't be fooled.  This is not ""so bad it's good"".  This is just bad.

In closing, if you're looking for a movie that IS funny AND offensive, I would point you to recent Troma releases such as ""Terror Firmer"" and ""Toxic Avenger 4"".  Just please don't buy this movie.",1103673600,16,1560,4.712686567164179
1936448,4,B0000E69JE,"You know, the ""reviewers"" here are very divided on this movie.  Nobody's really wrong or right it's up to your taste.

I read some of the good reviews and the bad and I have to admit, I tend to lean more towards the people who gave it a good review.  I almost fell for the bad reviewers spin but I had to see for myself and I'm happy I got the movie.

Crucial:  You should do the research and check out the reviewers ""history"".  The last 3 reviewers who rated 1 star for ""Undergroudn Comedy movie"" also rated Barry Manilow 5 stars, Barbara Streisand 5 stars and Elton John 5 stars.

That should provide you with the profile of the ""TYPE"" of people who rate Underground Comedy movie 1 star.  Too bad, because this movie definitely deserves an overall of 4 stars at the least - especially for the other ""TYPE"" of people that would love it. To these people I say, don't be fooled by the bad reviews.

The fact that there are real haters should help explain it's cult status and why it's so GOOD!  Jackass; Fight Club and even the Matrix (#1) have a myriad of haters when it first came out, probably because it was too edgy at the time but once the mainstream caught on then it was considered ""cool"".",1100304000,6,1196,4.275555555555556
1936449,1,B0000E69JE,"This was one of the most disappointing films I've seem in many years, and I'm very glad I only rented it instead of buying it. Like many of the other reviewers I was suckered into thinking it would be very funny because of the advertising, but virtually every humorous scene is included in the previews. Vince Offer in particular is an absolutely terrible actor and has no comic timing whatsoever. His movie tries to be funny through the use of sex and violence, but sex and violence aren't inherently funny, you need WRITING too. Overall, the project is a terribly flawed attempt to recreate the Zucker brother's ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" which still manages to be funny and offensive nearly thirty years after it was released. I recommend you go buy it instead.",1096070400,6,760,4.765151515151516

i seen this movie while watching comedy central and the comercial kept popping up and so i ordered it. what did i get? the worst dvd i have ever bought. there is no scene selection which would at least let me skip over the repeating skits (half the movie) they played the couple of half way good skits out to death and i was angry that i had wasted my good money on such trash. don't get me wrong, i love a lot of obscene crazy material, i am an ICP fan and my favorite movies are friday and fight club. but this movie was terrible from beginning to end. i would have given this movie a negative rating if i could just to show how bad it was. they had enough cameo appearances to be able to make some more decent skits, but they repeated the ones they had, barely changing them at all. look at all the other reviewer ratings besides the crackheads who voted 5 stars and you will see to avoid this movie at all costs.

If you're one of those high brow aspiring ""sophisticated"" types that have been too indoctrinated by their ""liberal arts"" class then you'll be disappointed in the style of this movie because it rips on everything you've learned.  I read one of the bad reviews where this halfwit said the movie imitates ""Kentucky Fried Movie"", I like KFM, but Underground Comedy surpasses it in more ways then one.  When I read some of the bad reviews it makes me laugh how disturbed they are.  I gave Underground 5 stars, but wished I could give it 10 stars for it's disturbance value on some of these pedants.",1087862400,9,732,4.564885496183206
1936462,1,B0000E69JE,"I am writing this review because I am upset that I paid good money for this and want to prevent other from sharing the same disapointment.
If you have seen the commercial for this you may think, as I did, that it looks really funny.  Well, you see, that is the brilliance of advertising.  'Undeground' does not deliver anything as promised.  It's main promise is that it WILL offend you.  This movie is actually not offensive because it tries so hard to be offensive.  There is an unnecessary amount of cursing and male (...) that makes it obvious how hard the film makers are trying to get the audience to squerm.
'Underground' is a collection of skits that are supposed to be funny. The supermodels taking a dump is part of a series throughout called ""Things you'll never see.""  It is not really all too funny and neither are the rest.  There is another one about a big black (...) virgin who has to turn down an advancing gay man. This skit was actually somewhat humorous; the first time.  It recurrs again in the film 2 or 3 times and totally kills the joke.
The film also has a ""very special apperance"" by Slash.  I don't need to explain who he is.  His apearance, was to say the least, dissapointing.  He hosts a ""rag lady"" competition and just acts like a complete idiot.  He firts apears with a bottle of jack daniels so you will know he has been drinking.  By the way he is acting it apears that he is pretending to be drunk rather than actually being drunk.  It is so dumb.  I mean that. Dumb.
It is so pathetic how hard this movie tries to push your buttons.  It just does not work.  For example, in the Godmother skit this guy presents a way to save money by replacing spaghetti meat with aborted fetus'.  He has a jar of this nasty looking stuff and slaps some on a plate. haha.  When I saw this I was like ""am I supposed to get sick or something?""  It's like hes holding out the plate and begging you to be sicked by it.  Practically begging for your upsetness.
This movie has nothing to it other than half-a$$ed atempts at grossing out.  Pleas don't buy it.  It is not offensive at all because it tries so hard to be so offensive.  It just looks sad.
I read a review that said people like me who think this movie sucks are basically not good enough to admit that the movie actually is funny and we just don't get it.  The reviewer said people like me should just say that the movie is just too much for me and maybe it will be funny to someone else who can handle it.  Here this: none of this movie offended me; it is just poorly done.  The scene in VanWilder where the dog (...) the danishes and then the guys eat them with dog semen dripping down their chins was funny.  It was funny because the movie had more to it.  Picture a movie where every scene is basically a re-creation of the dog semen scene.  That is what 'Underground' is and it gets really old after a while.
Many reviewers say they would give a movie 0 stars if they could.  This movie actually deserves the 1.  There are some subtle redemable qualities.  The skit ""Dickman fights lesbians"" was hilarious.  A big (...)headed super-hero shoots semen to beat lesbians.  The skit was not funny enought to redeem any of the rest of the movie.  There is also a music video that is a parody of ""I love L.A."" called ""I hate L.A.""  There are some funny lines in the song but it is overall dumb.  I liked the concept of it though.
To conlude, this movie did actaully offend me; inadvertantly.  I am offended by the review I see with 4-5 stars.  Ok, I hate this movie.  But even if you find it funny at least give it 3 stars or less becuase it is made so badly.  Take into account the predictablility of the skits and the choppy editing.  Actually, on second thought, do see this movie.  Don't buy it.  Rent it or see if someone you know has it.  I want you to understand how horrible it is.  I want you to feel the hatred towards the revieweres who gave it 5 stars that I do.

I have to admit the slogan of ""gauaranteed to offend everyone"" should be modified because it doesn't offend ""everyone"" really, just the religious fanatics and the pedantic types.
People who have been indoctrinated in respecting or admiring certain facets of life i.e. Supermodels, and then you see Supermodels in a gross out situation, Hello? you won't be able to laugh!
Case and point; the character from Clockwork Orange, he loved Beethoven so much, that he could not fathom seeing this admiration on the screen with grotesque material yet he was a hypocrite because Beethoven was his impetus to kill!
The word on the street is the movie is highly funny!  However, if you have been indoctrinated in certain things that you love and it's too taboo to laugh at you will have a retardation or disfunction in your muscles or brain (literally) and you won't be able to laugh - and that's the precise affliction people who are ""offended"" manifest when watching this movie.  And as in the above example, they also must be hypocrites as they dream of nasty things and notions - they know what I mean, don't play dumb.
It's like making a crippled kid walk.  He's going to be inflicted with pain.  So not being able to laugh at something taboo is a form of retardation.
I really feel sorry for these limited individuals because not only are they mentally and physically impaired due to their indoctrination (which is probably a combination of low IQ) but they are all in denial as evident in their review since they can't  claim they are ""offended"" (poor bastard souls) yet any rational person can read into the review and diagnose them as ""DISTURBED"" which is synonymous with Offended.
Furthermore, they have a huge void in their personality as they are desperately trying to be funny in their metaphorically bland ""jokes"" and situations.
Evidently they should not venture out into unknown territory and stick with the kind of humor that's safe  ""Sesame Street"", ""Mr. Rogers"", ""Brady Bunch"" and ""Leave it to Beaver"".
As a distinguished doctor in the medical field, I recommend everyone buy this movie, for nothing else but to challenge themselves for what will eventually truly come into existence....

I would have to agree that this is the single most offensive ""Movie"" ever made. Too true. I'm offended that the thoughtless turds who made this film dared to call it a movie. There is no story, no jokes, no sketches, and not a single positive thing worth mentioning. This ""movie"" should come with rusty razor blades, bleach, and ammonia, so that anyone who watches more than five minutes of it can kill themselves or anyone in the room who appears to be enjoying themselves.

I bought this movie expecting to be entertained with outragous skits and high hilarity. I like offensive humor, and I even appreciate crude and disgusting humor. After all, I am a guy. But the key word is HUMOR, which is harder to find in this tripe than Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.
Lets put it bluntly. This movie is not funny. It isn't funny in droves! It isn't even amusing. In fact, it is about as funny as the black plague sweeping through Europe. Hitler rolling into Poland was funnier!
Some of America's fastest rising young has-beens are showcased in a film of such meteoric banality as serve a fitting match for their mediocre talent. Slash, Joey Buttafuoco and Gena Lee Nolin show no talent whatsoever! Reaching the end of talent long before their time, they have committed career suicide to ensure they never work in this town again!
Astonishingly, Michael Clarke Duncan also appears in this miasma. He has evidently tired of Oscar nominations (Green Mile) or great roles such as in Armageddon or Daredevil, and opted to  castrate his future prospects by diving into the shallow end of the gene-pool!
Some of the concepts could have been great, could have been hilarious, but simply fell flat due to miserable and juvenille direction under the amaturish incompetence of Vince Offer. Scene after tedious scene revells in pointlessness, long after any possible humor value has evaporated into a lackluster blend of tiresome monotony and pathetic knavery.
Timing is the hallmark of good comedy, and it is absolutely nonexistent throughout this cavalcade of ineptitude. This movie is a feckless journey into a talentless world of incapacity and fallow imagination.
So, to summarize, this movie is stupid, frivolous, immature, mindless, dim witted, slow, banal, dull (monotonously so!), unintelligent and wholly lacking in talent, direction, and saddled with a script that could easily have been written by schoolboys who have suffered devastating brain damage. It is obtuse, simple-minded and artless.
It is all these things and more.
It is not, however, even remotely humorous, which is a tragic handicap for a comedy. It never hits on comedic value even by accident. This film is about as funny as receiving a diagnosis of cancer. It is not nearly as funny as mad cow disease, and less enjoyable than an asteroid impacting earth.
Note for Skeet Shooters: This film can serve at least one good purpose, on DVD, should you run out of clay pidgeons.
The Undergound Comedy is actually far worse than other films I have panned. It is only half as good as Gerry, a quarter as good as Hick Trek, and falls short of Plan 9 from Outer Space by a quantum factor of ten!
In short, this DVD now serves as a $20 dollar coaster on my coffee table.",1075680000,6,2760,4.872340425531915

I have never wanted to injure someone so much as after I have seen this movie.  I would rather drink a Snapple bottle full .... than watch this movie again.

I bought it and watched it Sunday night and i haven't laughed that hard in a long time.

Funny, funny stuff. The bag lady beauty pagent was, well, beautiful. I don't know what was funnier the old lady or Batman beating her for no apparent reason, I'm laughing now just thinking of her views on baseball.

8001903,1,B0000E69JE,"I couldn't resist watching this after finding it in a list of worst movies of all time.  Or rather, I TRIED watching it, it is just too much of a waste of time.  It is hard to see what part of this movie would pass as humor even among the most debase, emotionally stunted, toilet-humor-loving adolescents.  Just terrible.

The jokes don't fall flat, they're nonexistent. Hey, a street criminal terrorizes an old lady then knocks her head off with a baseball bat!  Ha ha!  A black[face] guy calls a KKK guy stupid then shoots him!  Ha ha ha!  Look, those homeless people have bad teeth and are clearly mentally ill!  Rofl!  Or, my personal ""favorite"" - Joey Buttafuco, working for a mafia Don, harangues a visitor about having a snack. Joey leaves, visitor complains to the Don about some Rabbi getting in the way of his movie career. Don has a ham planted in the Rabbi's bed. End Scene. SO FUNNY I CAN'T BELEIVE IT!

You can only walk away thinking anyone involved in this movie (particularly the writer/director/star) are just horrible, cynically twisted, awful people.  Trying to get traction with a ""joke"" about a forced abortion?  This movie would like to think it's offensive, but it's not. It's offensive that there are people in the world who are so socially retarded that they might think this is funny.

PS - The internet says this cost $170k to make: BS!  The production quality is actually quite good, and plenty was spent on sets, location shooting, and the parade of B and C grade celebrities seen throughout.  Me thinks this Vince Offer fellow put out the 170 number to cover the extent of his humiliation.  Such a terrible undertaking.
