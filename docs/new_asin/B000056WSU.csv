7932844,5,B000056WSU,"OK, first of all, what has happened to children's animation today? Besides being laden with an assortment of annoying characters (e.g., ""Pokemon"") or computer-animated (Beast Wars) cartoons have lost the appeal that they had during the golden age of television animation. In the 1970s, Hanna-Barbara ruled the television airwaves with a series of successful, enjoyable series that featured cool characters and crazy capers, such as ""Scooby Doo.""
""Josie and the Pussycats"" was one of my favorites due to the fact that there was a combination of good music, humor, and adventures. In ""Josie and the Pussycats - The Melody Memory Mix-Up"" viewers are treated to four classic episodes from this series that was based on the popular Archies Comics characters. Featuring all the characters that made the series a hit: Josie, Valerie, Melody, Alan, Alexander, and my two favorite characters Alexandra and Sebastian the cat, this tape is a pleasant trip down memory lane. For those who saw the recent live action film based on the series (which was good) I recommend you view the original series to get an idea of how the characters were portrayed in the comic strip compared to the big screen (story was based on a spoof of modern-day boy bands and commercialism). For new fans who were not alive or to young to remember the series during the 1970s, this videocassette compilation will help you get acquainted with a classic cartoon series. The only negative point of this video is that I only wish that they had this series on DVD instead of video. I prefer DVDs because of their crisp, clear pictures and compact size, and with the clamshell cover this video comes in, I unlikely would call that compact.
Make sure to get both Josie videocassettes (the other one is called ""The Melody Mix-Up) available on Amazon. They are truly worth every cent, especially for a Gen Xer like myself!",1017878400,3,1878,4.908805031446541
