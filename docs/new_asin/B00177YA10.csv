3168011,2,B00177YA10,"New Zealand / Singapore co-production!  That's not something you see every day.. and a fair stab at a Hollywood style movie with local flavour it is, too.
The token American, Jason Behr, is a disenfranchised tattooist, who stumbles across a Samoan group of tattooists in Singapore (and that's where Singapore gets a few postcard type shots for their financial contribution..) at a tattooists convention.  As a result of a poor decision he makes there, he ends up with a curse on him that he then has to try and get to the root of - taking him to the home of the tattoists and trying to understand their mystical connection to their tattoos, in - of course - New Zealand.
It's not really a full blown horror - there are few real jumps, not that much blood, but rather it's a mixture of problem solving with a spooky element.  And it's not bad - you have to give them credit for finding a new topic to avoid the Hollywood staleness, with the flavour of Samoan culture.  However, at the end of the day Jason Behr is just so limp in the role it's difficult to get invested in his fate, and the would be puzzle is pretty easy to spot.  It tries rather hard to be thoughtful, but does not quite live up to being meaningful, and yet fails to put its foot firmly in the thriller camp either.. and so ends up nowhere.
So if you are looking for a change to the routine settings for this genre, try it out - but if you like blood and gore or abundant thrills, or thought provoking thinking-man's material, then look elsewhere..",1220832000,,1516,4.380782918149467

3168013,3,B00177YA10,"This New Zealand-made film is quite different and original, about an American tattoo artist who becomes involved with a supernatural spirit related to Samoan tattoing and Somoan culture, and has to figure out what is going on and try to set things right (before anybody else dies). The acting, the cinematography, and the filmmaking are very high quality for a low budget independent type picture. There is a chilling 'backstory' of Jake's childhood that set him on his course as a globe trotting tattoo artist, collecting designs from other cultures, but the main action is set in Singapore and then mostly in New Zealand. There is a certain ick factor with the victims' inky deaths, but I wouldn't really call this a horror film, but more of a mysterious scary thriller. The action in the film makes sense within the culture of the story and there is a satisfactory resolution to things. The DVD 'extra stuff' is also very interesting. The New Zealand Somoans were so pleased with how their culture was being presented, they made Jason Behr and director Peter Burger honorary chiefs and they show some of that. There is a narrative commentary of the film with Jason Behr and the director.",1218153600,19,1190,4.838235294117647
3168014,4,B00177YA10,"I was not sure what to expect, Since there were no reviews of this movie in the U.S,  I am a Jason Behr fan so I relied on the information on his fan sites and from other fans that had already seen the movie.  I thought it was a surprisingly and welcome, change to the usual blood and guts thriller movies in the U.S,  It had imagination and uniqueness that we as americans have lost, its always about bigger and better explosions and CGI effects, this movie was well written and held your attention dispite that it was a low budget film, I never really felt that during the film, Jasons character had depth and seemed very real.  I especially enjoyed the cultural aspect of the film, I learned a lot about New Zealand, I did not know before, and about the Samoan tattoo legends.  Relying on your imagination gives your more possiblities then just knowing whats going to happen and then waiting to see how they planned on CGI'ing it to death.  All in all this was a refreshing piece of entertainment, and purhaps I am a little bias since I have enjoyed Jason Behr's character as Max Evans in Roswell prior.  I would recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see real acting, not just CGI animation and unbelievable stunts that no real human was ever attempt. !  Enjoy",1218067200,9,1270,4.443965517241379

3168018,4,B00177YA10,"Jason Behr, who first came to my attention in the excellent werewolf movie 'Skinwalkers"", is just as compelling in this very spooky thriller. This film was totally engaging and never thew me out of the story with bad acting, cinamatography, or irrevelance. As a long term fan of the thriller/horror genre it was great finding a film that I can watch again, and had what I found to be a unique and interesting story-line and cast. This is a definate keeper and not because of the brief shot of the back of Jason Behr's character standing nude before a huge picture glass window in Singapore.",1215820800,20,590,4.628571428571429

The samoan traditions and their ways are very sacred to the people of Samoa. To steal it and remove it from its home, isn't allowed. The movie illustrates the true meaning of what would happen to you or your peers when you do something like that. Samoan traditions don't play. :)",1397520000,,453,4.341176470588235

3168045,2,B00177YA10,"I liked the premise of the story with the Tatt's possessing a spirit that is killing the people receiving the tattoos from the lead (Jason Behr) character. The writing and execution of this story is what gets this slow moving and short on thrills movie in trouble. Behr's character is less than believable as a tattoo artist for many reasons. Here is a few of the more obvious ones, He never uses a transfer to do his work? He puts his own design on the girls belly without consulting her on the design? He didn't use vaseline and or bandage his work on most of his clients? We are never told why he is the ""so called healer tattooist""

While I liked the Samoan influence on the story for the disgraced spirit entity the story only touched the surface on the culture and the western comtamination of their culture and their struggle to return to the ways of old. I just was not taken in by this story nor was I by Behr's character or his actions. I only cared for the Samoan girl that he hooks up with. While I wasn't surprised by their hooking up even thought what her cousin said about her and her religion and her dating a white guy. They (the writer) tried to make this a Romeo and Juliet kind of thing that you could see coming a mile away. The spirits characters story seemed a little rushed at the end of the movie to bring it all together in a neat little package.

There was not much of any kind of scary element to this movie nor was it evenly paced and my attention waned on a few occasions.

The movie has a fair amount of cursing with a couple of sex w/nudity scenes and some violence, but nothing is over the top. The acting ranges from so...so to good with the direction falling in the good category. As I have mentioned before the writing and execution is the bad guy that took a cool premise and made it into a so...so story. Would I watch this again? NO. Was it a waste of time to watch? Almost. 2 stars

I wasn't expecting too much from a movie that I have never heard of, but The Tattoo isn't a bad movie considering its small budget. Actually, the special effects really standout compared to the big-budget horror movies. I wouldn't classify this as a horror movie as it is more of a mystery.",1350691200,3,553,4.642857142857143

I honestly (at 26 years old) got a little freaked out the night I finished it. Between this movie and the book I was reading I couldn't go to sleep until my husband came home. lol I know I'm a dork. I think the movie could have been a little better but it was still good.

3168070,2,B00177YA10,"The DVD itself was in excellent condition with no skips or scratches. However, this movie by far is not Jason Behr's best work. I much preferred him on Roswell. In any case, the premise of a cursed tattoo instrument is, to say the least, lame. The script was not lukewarm and undeserving of the JB's talents. The sign of a great movie is that you would watch it again sometime in the future. That's not going to happen here. I'm not blaming the actors, just the brain trust that came up with the dumb idea.",1317686400,,506,4.336842105263158

3168074,5,B00177YA10,"Not sure what I can add to the praise comments about this film. I got it out of curiosity before reading reviews and was very pleasantly surprised and impressed. First the great photography and artistry grabbed me, and then the South Pacific setting and cultural contrasts. Then I got into the story and appreciated how fresh it was in various ways. I kept thinking of the Last Wave in terms of getting into non-western spiritual mentalities surviving and having reality in the modern world, but of course these are very different films, still, both very well done and great.

The ethnographic thread has a lot to do with the importance of shame and community in this non-Western culture and this is nicely explored in the film. The film may not be so interesting to people who are not especially open to getting into how people who are different from them think, feel, and live.

I must say that there was much too much gore here for my own personal tastes. But I can certainly put up with gore if it helps make a good story work. In the end the gore was not gratuitous but helped make the emotions in the characters more convincingly intense. Came together.

Hard to believe that this film was aimed at younger fans of horror movies. Apparently not; and they might want to look elsewhere for films more typical of horror and slasher genre.

The extra features were short but very worthwhile for me and answered a few questions. Good.",1280275200,,1435,4.6156862745098035
3168075,5,B00177YA10,"Brilliant film.  Excellent plot.  Great mix of the ancient rich and diverse Samoan culture, being threatened by modern day pop influences of hip-hop, colliding with tattoo symbolism and unjust shame turned avenging evil spirit.  Loved the concept of equal parts suspense murder mystery and horror genre (great horror death in hospital).  Loved the concept of strong arm, weak arm for Jake (Jason Behr).  Loved the concept of healing tattoos.  Brilliant performances by Jason Behr and an exceptionally wonderful New Zealand supporting cast.  The shot of Jake's full back art (done in strong symbols), pulling away to reveal Sina's full back art (evil spirit's tattoo turned into tree of life) is stunningly beautiful.  I really loved this movie even though I'm not into horror and don't have a single tattoo.  I'm not sure how tiny New Zealand manages to put out so many great movies.",1275782400,3,883,5.076388888888889

3168078,5,B00177YA10,"I watched this movie twice on dvd, once with normal sound and once with commentary.

The Good:  This movie has very high production values IMO and I will definitely be buying it.  The story was original and the film was pretty scary.  The SFX were surprisingly good as well.

The Not-So-Good:  There's a line in the film where they're trying to figure out why someone has disappeared.  The character is supposed to have run away because he feared the pain of finishing his tattoo.  Jason Behr's character says something like ""Maybe he ran off to live in Greenwich Village and is very happy.""

The ""logic"" here is as follows:  ""Real men"" get tattoos.  Men who don't get tattoos because they're afraid of pain are gay.... or might as well be.

Um, okay???

I've heard a rumor that the writer and director's next film project will be about a writer and director who are trapped in a time warp and stuck in the Fifties.",1230163200,,915,4.539877300613497

3402566,3,B00177YA10,"Honestly I bought this movie because I was watching Roswell on Netflix and was interested it other work that he had done. So I typed his name in and this popped up. I honestly (at 26 years old) got a little freaked out the night I finished it. Between this movie and the book I was reading I couldn't go to sleep until my husband came home. lol I know I'm a dork. I think the movie could have been a little better but it was still good.

3402567,2,B00177YA10,"The DVD itself was in excellent condition with no skips or scratches. However, this movie by far is not Jason Behr's best work. I much preferred him on Roswell. In any case, the premise of a cursed tattoo instrument is, to say the least, lame. The script was not lukewarm and undeserving of the JB's talents. The sign of a great movie is that you would watch it again sometime in the future. That's not going to happen here. I'm not blaming the actors, just the brain trust that came up with the dumb idea.",1317686400,,506,4.336842105263158
3402568,4,B00177YA10,"I purchased this movie for my boyfriend for his birthday because he likes horror and related stuff. I wasn't sure I would like it, as it started out slightly slow, but once it got going, it had an ok story line. It wasn't scary in the least, but it DID have a happy ending, and I'm a stickler for those!",1313884800,3,303,4.066666666666666
3402569,5,B00177YA10,"I really enjoyed this movie!! I am a fan of horror/suspense/thriller genre and came across this movie after watching another great horror movie with Jason Behr, Senseless. I thought the story was great, as was the acting all around. After I finished watching the first time I immediately watched it again with the audio commentary, which made me like it all that much more! I would highly recommend this movie.",1299283200,2,410,4.871428571428571

3402571,5,B00177YA10,"Not sure what I can add to the praise comments about this film. I got it out of curiosity before reading reviews and was very pleasantly surprised and impressed. First the great photography and artistry grabbed me, and then the South Pacific setting and cultural contrasts. Then I got into the story and appreciated how fresh it was in various ways. I kept thinking of the Last Wave in terms of getting into non-western spiritual mentalities surviving and having reality in the modern world, but of course these are very different films, still, both very well done and great.

The ethnographic thread has a lot to do with the importance of shame and community in this non-Western culture and this is nicely explored in the film. The film may not be so interesting to people who are not especially open to getting into how people who are different from them think, feel, and live.

I must say that there was much too much gore here for my own personal tastes. But I can certainly put up with gore if it helps make a good story work. In the end the gore was not gratuitous but helped make the emotions in the characters more convincingly intense. Came together.

Hard to believe that this film was aimed at younger fans of horror movies. Apparently not; and they might want to look elsewhere for films more typical of horror and slasher genre.

The extra features were short but very worthwhile for me and answered a few questions. Good.",1280275200,,1435,4.6156862745098035
3402572,5,B00177YA10,"Brilliant film.  Excellent plot.  Great mix of the ancient rich and diverse Samoan culture, being threatened by modern day pop influences of hip-hop, colliding with tattoo symbolism and unjust shame turned avenging evil spirit.  Loved the concept of equal parts suspense murder mystery and horror genre (great horror death in hospital).  Loved the concept of strong arm, weak arm for Jake (Jason Behr).  Loved the concept of healing tattoos.  Brilliant performances by Jason Behr and an exceptionally wonderful New Zealand supporting cast.  The shot of Jake's full back art (done in strong symbols), pulling away to reveal Sina's full back art (evil spirit's tattoo turned into tree of life) is stunningly beautiful.  I really loved this movie even though I'm not into horror and don't have a single tattoo.  I'm not sure how tiny New Zealand manages to put out so many great movies.",1275782400,3,883,5.076388888888889

3402575,5,B00177YA10,"I watched this movie twice on dvd, once with normal sound and once with commentary.

The Good:  This movie has very high production values IMO and I will definitely be buying it.  The story was original and the film was pretty scary.  The SFX were surprisingly good as well.

The Not-So-Good:  There's a line in the film where they're trying to figure out why someone has disappeared.  The character is supposed to have run away because he feared the pain of finishing his tattoo.  Jason Behr's character says something like ""Maybe he ran off to live in Greenwich Village and is very happy.""

The ""logic"" here is as follows:  ""Real men"" get tattoos.  Men who don't get tattoos because they're afraid of pain are gay.... or might as well be.

Um, okay???

I've heard a rumor that the writer and director's next film project will be about a writer and director who are trapped in a time warp and stuck in the Fifties.",1230163200,,915,4.539877300613497
