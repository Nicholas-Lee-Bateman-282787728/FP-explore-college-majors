229173,3,6300213927,"I bought this video more out of curiosity than out of a desire to see an excellent depiction of David.
If you're interested in a very good movie on the life of David, I recommend Turner Network Television's David (the one in the Bible series). It is the best of the 4 David movies I've seen.
This movie is OK, but seems very lacking. The production quality is average and the big hollywood style of camera works seems out of place in the movie. And, like the other reviewer, I was a little surprised by the nudity. There are two scenes. One with Michal (which is not salacious) and one with Bathsheba (which is more salacious -- but it does fit the real Biblical context, though).
As far as Biblical accuracy goes, it's not bad overall. I think it does not accurately portray Jonathan at all and I think they skipped over some critical scenes. Also, some key concepts Scripture teaches are omitted from the scene (like David's response to Goliath). The rest, though, wasn't too bad.
Still, if you're looking for a good representation, definitely pick the TNT David and not this one.",994636800,10,1082,4.582474226804123

229175,4,6300213927,"This is not the bomb it was purported to be when it was first released in the 1980's.  This features Gere's best work, and an excellent supporting cast.  The biblical epic genre has not been revived since this film except on TV, so have a look at a real film with real acting and directing.  One problem: the second half does turn a little superficial, and if a film ever deserved an R rating instead of a PG-13, this is the one.  What was the MPAA thinking??",982108800,4,459,4.241379310344827
229176,1,6300213927,"We bought this tape for our son who loves the story of David and Goliath.  After watching about 20 to 30 minutes, through a very short and unbiblical scene of the battle between David and Goliath, we were shocked to see  frontal female nudity.  No, I am not overreacting!  This was not a passing  glance or a flash by on camera.  The scene was focused on this image and  was in danger of lasting longer than the afore mentioned famous battle,  before we gained our composure and turned it off.  Don't let the PG-13  rating decieve you.  I did.  Nowhere on the tape, dust cover, or this web  site is nudity in this film mentioned.  This tape is definitly going back.",964137600,11,665,4.3884297520661155
229177,5,6300213927,"His portrayal of King David brought glory to God, not Richard Gere.  Worldly critics, and the mass enslaved did not praise the content or intent of this movie...the message of worshipping God and not IDOLS is made very  clear in the BOOK of Samuel 16:7 ""The Lord does not look at the things  man looks at.  Man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks as  the heart.""  I beleive the part Richard played had a huge impact on  his personal quest for truth.  Gere converted from his roots in  Christianity from a Methodist to the Tibetan school of Buddhism in 1982.  The movie was filmed in 1985.  Samuel 16:3  ""God said, you are to  annoint for me the one I indicate"".  Richard's talent is a gift from  God.  Richard's heart was influenced by Buddhism, but His heart is ruled  and changed by God.  In 1988 Gere used his visibility to promote the  oppressed in China.  His performance in this movie honors God. God chooses  the foolish to confound the wise! King Solomon came from King David's lust  for Bethsheeba...the Lord is faithful to those whose hearts are  pure..Richard has a servants heart.  His role in this movie changed Richard  forever, and it inspired me to read the entire book of Samuel.",954028800,3,1212,4.577464788732394
229178,5,6300213927,"Richard Gere conforms gloriously to the role of David. His countenance changes and he makes for a fabulous King David. And Ian Sears made the perfect young King David. The story begins with the life of a lowly  shepherd boy whose bravery and faith in his God ascend him to the throne of  ancient Israel. Telling the legend from David's battle with Goliath, to his  self-destructive love for Bathsheba, to the anointing of his son Solomon by  the prophet Nathan to be the King Of Israel.  This was a very interesting  making of the life of King David. I would enjoy seeing it again.",953769600,31,581,4.538461538461538
229179,5,6300213927,"What a fantastic and interesting way to bring this story of the bible to life.  I recommend this movie to both my Christian and non-Christian friends alike.  It brings David to life beyond the basic 'David and  Goliath' story.  It vividly portrays his successes and faults making him a  bible character we can all relate to.  But like many other religious films,  it inspires you to look at your life and try harder.  You leave the film  wanting to be like David in his good times and avoid the mistakes he made  during his bad times.

Richard Gere does a surprisingly good job of playing David, but Edward Woodward steals the show as Kind Saul in all of his manic and disturbed glory. The sets and costumes are period appropriate and well done as is the score so don't expect any type of DeMille style grandeur to be found here.

There was so much more they should have done and for a Director who claimed he wanted to make this film like the Story of David found in the Old Testament , I was extremely disappointed.
David slew Goliath, this is probably one of the most significant stories of the Bible and they, the Director and Crew, maid it seem like a joke. David sees Goliath, walks up to him and slays him. What ever happened to the significant and important dialogue between David and Goliath. This would have been  essential to the story of explaining why David was considered one of Israel's greatest king, a severe disappointment and despite what ever efforts they should have been thorough.",1485734400,5,827,4.440789473684211

229323,3,6300213927,"The credits say the writers took the story from the Bible (The Books of Samuel I and II, Chronicles I and the Psalms of David). It doesn't take long for anyone who has read the Biblical account of David's life to realize that they didn't stick to the source. I know it's a huge story and it's difficult to cut it down to fit in a two hour movie. But key elements were not true to David's life - or character. First off, the story of Bathsheba. They committed adultery. They didn't wait until after Uriah was dead to sleep together! Secondly, when God told David he would not be the one to build the temple, David wasn't angry. He accepted God's decision and praised Him for the blessing He gave him along with His decision. Lastly, David knew he was a man after God's own heart because he talked to God regularly and followed His counsel. In the movie, David yearned to see God because everyone kept telling him he was after God's own heart, but he also seemed puzzled by the ""title"" because the impression was given that he never really knew God. So not true! My advice is to take the movie with a grain of salt, then go read the Book. It's always better.",1469491200,14,1156,4.307339449541284
229364,3,6300213927,"I was suspicious when I first noted that the movie was only 1 hr. 53 min. David is a long story. You need an epic movie or a mini-series to cover it.

229369,1,6300213927,"Wonderful production values summoned up the Iron Age very nicely (spear and sandal films are hard to do credibly with so many Jesus movies out there).  The cinematography was beautiful with terrific settings (but clearly not in Israel).  The village scenes, palace scenes and landscapes stole the show. Richard Gere was either miscast or out to lunch--no joie de vivre as you might expect from a David, although the dance before the ark was energetic.  The script devoted too much time to the early phases and not enough in the late, so the Tamar and Amnon episode never conveyed the true seriousness of the crime and David's aging and death came up abruptly.  They needed a better script and better pacing to tell such a huge story. Saul was excellent as were many of the other actors, obviously British (Gere's diction was beneath commenting on).",1465776000,,848,4.827586206896552

229372,3,6300213927,"This movie hits most of the plot points of David's life story as told in the Bible, and it looks good while doing it!  Unfortunately, characterization is weak, it lacks emotional heft, and the ending is a mess.

Positives:
- The production values were excellent.  Great costumes, crowd scenes, and battle scenes.  Believable set.  Nice armor!
- An impressive number of the events of David's life were included in this film, including moments I've see in no other David movie, like him taking refuge with the Philistines during his wilderness years.
- Best David and Goliath scene of any David movie I've seen.  Two whole armies face off.  The tension is real!
- Best dramatic moment in the movie:  the massacre of the priests at Nob.  Had me cheering for the high priest.
- I appreciated the reoccurring theme of David seeking the face of God.

Negatives:
- Poor character development.  David was a passionate man, but here he is too often stone-faced, lacking in charisma.  The main characters too often engage in pointless spats to amp up the drama, to the detriment of their character:  David mouths off to Samuel while Samuel is anointing him?  Michal is cold to David on their wedding night?  Why?
- On the other hand, the relationship of David and Bathsheba, a point of real drama, is dealt with too briefly.
- Especially in the last third of the movie, the plot begins to race too fast and loses coherency.  The connection between David's adultery and Absalom's rebellion is missed - ""a sword shall pierce your house.""  One line of dialogue would have done it!
- David dances before the ark looking like an ape in a diaper.  Ouch.
- The last five minutes of the movie take a real nose dive into spiritual incoherency.  David's invented fallout with Nathan, his ""destruction of the temple,"" and his deathbed speech to Solomon (""follow your heart, not the prophets"") that is pretty much the polar opposite of his deathbed speech in Scripture.  Say what?
- The prophets are portrayed as self-important promoters of an angry God.  This introduces an anti-organized religion slant which subverts the spirit of the original story.

While I think the definitive movie on the life of King David has yet to be made, I recommend TNT's ""David"" over this.  It's high on character development and scriptural accuracy, though low on dramatic tension.  For great scenery chewing in an otherwise B-movie, check out Orson Welles as Saul in ""David and Goliath.""",1464825600,,2450,4.80622009569378
229373,5,6300213927,"This movie is very close to actual biblical scripture of the rise of King David starting from his early childhood when he was just a boy tending his fathers sheep, to the slaying of Goliath, the fall of King Saul and then to becoming what God had intended, the ""King of Israel"".
David shows his love and respect for Gods choice of King Saul even after Saul tried to hunt him down and kill him over becoming so popular with Saul's own following .. This movie will inspire and entertain at the same time as David finds himself in Gods favor and then falls from grace over the lust for another mans wife.. David dancing in the street is a highlight for me and a must see just as the bible accounts as he was finally crowned King..
Richard Gere stars in this movie and was perfect for this role as a young and old David..",1464652800,,817,4.243589743589744

229493,1,6300213927,"This is another attempt by Hollywood to re-write the Bible. They put enough of Scripture into the story to make it credible, but change things around to create confusion. For instance, in the account of Bathsheba there is no mention of the adulterous relationship and subsequent pregnancy, which is the motive for David's murder of Uriah. Instead, the implication is that David orders Uriah's death simply because of his desire for Bathsheba. Another example is when David hears of the death of Absalom, ""David"" gives an exact quote of what the real David said when he learned that the child of Bathsheba's pregnancy (by David) said of the child (from 2 Samuel 12:23), ""I shall go to him, but he shall nor return to me."" That's some pretty egregious artistic license. These are just a couple of examples, but the perversion of God's Word is a continuous thread in this production. Throughout the movie David seems to be unsure of who God is. Finally, the writers of the script have David, as he is dying and giving Solomon his charge, utter a blasphemous statement, ""First rule! Always follow your heart no matter what the prophets say."" Also, there was some nudity depicted a couple times.",1438732800,2,1190,4.809756097560975

229559,2,6300213927,"King David is an film about the second king of Israel, David that was based on from biblical accounts of Samuel I & II, Chronicles I and the Psalms. It follow through the events of fifty years wherein he's had many wives,numerous romances, brutal fights like that against Goliath,the insidious betrayals from his traitorous son Absalom,his encounters with the the weak-willed King Saul, and his experiences with his childhood friend Jonathan.

No question that this was a poor film about King David. Richard Gere does not look comfortable portraying him. The screenplay just passes through the events and does not provide a character study of the Israelite king. One would feel bored watching it and probably won't even care for the events nor the characters of the movie.",1417737600,,772,5.03125

229562,2,6300213927,"Sigh. Awesome cast choice. Richard Gere and the supporting cast were great but they BUTCHERED the Biblical chronological timeline and destroyed one KEY POINT of King David's life, Bathsheba and Uriah. HOW DO YOU MESS THAT UP? They REALLY watered it down so much to the point that you MISS how serious it is was. The movie made it very subtle, like it wasn't serious to be a peeping tom while watching Bathsheba bathe, then have sex with her as a married woman which is committing adultery, he gets her pregnant, then intentionally plots to kill her husband, murders husband and then marries her. This key point was a domino effect that caused a ""sword in his household."" (Division and punishment).

The director of this movie messed this up and then tried to criminalize God as if the downhill of David's life was cruel of God and not a punishment because the movie plot is so unorganized. This movie puts the consequences of David's choice BEFORE he was rebuked by the Prophet Nathan.  Do yourself a favor and just read 1 Samuel 16 to 1 Kings 2:10-11. The way King Saul and his sons died was much more brutal than the movie too. Also King David danced in his garments not his underwear like the movie. That was funny to watch but inaccurate.

The way it is written is so much MORE raw, real and powerful than this sugary movie. The Word of God is perfect and powerful. You don't need to add or take anything away.

King David, though a Flawed man, was transparent and a repenting man who truly Loved God. You can relate to King David because we all mess up, but having a heart devoted to God and repenting, you can get back up again.",1416700800,10,1634,4.454849498327759

229690,4,6300213927,"I DO LIKE a lot the part where DAVID DANCES before the Lord. It was always hard for me to imagine how David did that and I think they did a wonderful job with that scene. It really stuck in my mind and brought 2 Sam 6:14 to life. I also like the part where he mourns for his son Absolom (very very moving) or where Absolom gets stuck in the tree (that was hard to imagine too--brought 2 Sam 18:9 to life)

I do however strongly disagree with the advice David gives at the end to his son Solomon. He advises him not to listen to prophets but to listen to his heart. That is so contradictory to what the Bible teaches. ""The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it?."" Jer 17:9
There are lots of unscriptural elements in this movie, but I did like the acting and beautiful scenery and it did make me pick up the Bible and see what it really says. Also nude scenes were unnecessary.

I did not like how they handled the Bethsheba story either. They made it look like her husband Uriah did not love her, but according to what God said through prophet Nathan, Uriah did love her.

Goliath scene was okay but they should have used the words in the Bible for that. They are so powerful. ""You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the LORD Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.""",1393718400,12,1380,4.180451127819549

He was so believable in his acting role as a vengeful King and enemy of King David.  King Saul's whole screen presence dominated the movie; and kept my attention.  I also felt this movie was true to the bibles version of events such as with King Saul's daughter marrying and later despising King David.  This movie is definitely worth the watch.

229714,5,6300213927,"King David, 1985 film

This takes place 1,000 BC. Their God orders then to eliminate another tribe, their men, women, and children are offensive. Samuel reminds the King of Israel of the prophecy. Another man will replace him, one of Jesses sons. Men judge by outwards appearances. Samuel uses two stones to judge the candidates. David is chosen to gather the scattered tribes and drive out the heathen from Israel. David is brought before the king to sing and entertain him. There will be a battle, there will be a challenge between two champions before the battle. Israel sends out a boy to face Goliath, the champion of the Philistines. David gathers stones (used by shepherds to drive away wolves from their flocks). So be it. The Philistines run off in retreat. The Israelites triumph, David serves King Saul for ten years as commander of his army. David takes a wife, they go to their bridal chamber. Did I please you, my lord?

Men gather together to discuss things. King Saul worries about his reign. There is conflict, the King is jealous. David flees to a refuge. When King Saul searches for him David flees again. Saul orders the priests killed one by one until Samuel talks! David remained in the wilderness for six years. King Saul continues to hunt with his army. Can David meet King Saul safely? David takes a  souvenir to prove a point. A blind man carries a message to the Philistines, he is given refuge. Later King Saul rides out against the Philistines, alone. Who marches with the King and his son? They face a stronger enemy but succeed at first. Then there is a flanking attack with chariots. The Israelites are defeated, King Sauls son Jonathan is slain, the mighty are fallen. David dances in public. The Ark of the Covenant is shown to David. Later David sees a woman bathing. David plans a new temple on the hill of Zion.

Moses commands the extermination of the heathen. People petition King David. He meets Bathsheeba. A woman has no redress against her husband. There is an assault on a woman, her brother Absalon seeks revenge. Murder carries the death penalty, but Absalom is banished from the kingdom. There is another legal problem. Thou art the man. Do what you will. His punishment is stated. King David has a son named Solomon. Absalom offers a political solution to the disaffected, the rabble follow him. King David is advised to strike now before its too late. He visits the Ark of the Covenant. Absaloms forces are surprised by archers. Absalom flees but is pursued and caught. King David has rejected Gods commands by not listening to the prophets. David shows his anger by using the sword of Goliath. Later David defeated the Philistines and other heathen tribes, wiping them out. [Ethnic cleansing?] David reigned for forty years then had Solomon anointed King.

This portrayal of a Bible story is entertaining and educational. I didn't read the book but Im sure it is faithful to the original. Human natures doesnt change. You can read Karl Shaws book Royal Babylon for other examples of royal intrigues and behavior. Kitty Kelley wrote The Royals about the British aristocracy.",1388361600,,3123,4.786641929499073

I was sickened when I saw the TRUE message behind the movie, though.
The film portrays Saul as a rebel against God and His prophets, specifically Samuel. Saul is bad, or, evil, for this. Understandable.
The film THEN portrays David as a king that disobeys God and His prophets, specifically Nathan. Nathan rebukes David at the end of the film as having ""disobeyed the Lord and refusing to obey the prophets"".
David consistently shows disdain and hatred toward following the clear Word of the Lord throughout the film.
Nice touch. Wow.
Then, at the end of the film, Hollywood helps us understand this double standard. Why can David disobey God while Saul can't. The answer is given by David himself in his last words of the film to his son Solomon:
""Follow your heart. The heart is the ONLY place where God speaks to man. Don't follow the prophets. Follow your heart.""
The Bible teaches our heart is desperately wicked and the Bible was written by His prophets!

But David is not all perfect. He does make serious mistakes in his life and the largest one was having Uriah the Hittite killed to satisfy his lust for his wife Bathsheba. Of course God punishes David for this, but it turns out OK in the end because she eventually gives birth to Solomon a great king of Israel.

This movie goes beyond the often told story of David and Goliath. In fact this movie sort of glosses over this story and moves into his life running from Saul. The movie showed David in a different light and one I have seen him in for a long time. I had forgotten that he had more than 5 wives! I had forgotten that he danced in the streets when he was proclaimed king.

229904,4,6300213927,"David is hands-down my favorite Biblical character (aside from JC himself, of Course). I never tire of reading and studying the events of his life -- the trials & perseverances, the agonies & ecstasies, the successes and failures (man, that sounds hokey, huh?).

Well, 1985's ""King David,"" starring Richard Gere in the titular role, essentially covers IT ALL. That's right, you'll see all the following events covered in the picture:

-- Samuel's choosing of David as successor to King Saul
-- Israel's battles with the Philistines
-- The challenge of the hulk Goliath and David's victory with a sling shot
-- David playing his harp to soothe Saul's torment
-- Saul's increasing jealousy and hatred of David
-- David & Jonathan's brotherly love
-- David's wandering in the wilderness with his men, fleeing Saul
-- David's stealing Saul's spear while he sleeps in a cave, sparing him
-- Saul's suicide
-- David dancing in his skivvies when the Ark is brought into Jerusalem
-- Michal's love and, later, hatred of David (as he dances before the LORD)
-- David secretly ogling hottie Bathsheba bathing from his palace roof and the ensuing adultery
-- David's murder of Uriah (Bathsheba's husband) and Nathan's rebuke
-- Amnon's rape of his half-sister Tamar
-- Absalom's justified slaying of half-brother Amnon
-- Absalom's stealing of the Israelite's hearts
-- Absalom's death and David's grieving

WHAT WORKS:

-- The film is very worthwhile if you desire to see these numerous events depicted before your very eyes.
-- The cast, sets, costumes, locations and filmmaking are all of the highest order for 1985.
-- Edward Woodward is excellent as the jealous and bitter King Saul, even though he lacks Saul's heighth (as he was a whole head taller than any other Israelite).
-- Most aspects of the David/Goliath challenge are great; for instance, the troops shown on two separate hills.
-- Alice Krige is truly beautiful as Bathsheba. Along the same lines, the woman who plays Michal is very good and possesses a very unique beauty.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK:

-- Despite the numerous events covered in David's life, the film only runs 1 hour and 51 minutes before the closing credits. Let's face it, there's at least 3 hours of material here. Condensing it down to less than 2 hours prevents the viewer from being captivated by the myriad characters and events. The viewer is left struggling to connect with the people and their stories.
-- Despite the numerous events flying by, the film has a bit of a lazy vibe. There's very little spectacle like ""The Ten Commandments"" or ""Ben-Hur.""
-- David was a very passionate man -- a ""man after God's own heart."" Gere is fine for this role (the Bible explicitly states that David was a ruddy and handsome man) but he plays the character a bit overly righteous, pensive and noble, hence, David never fully comes alive to the viewer. Please notice I said ""a bit"" and ""never FULLY comes alive."" In other words, Gere is quite decent in the role. In fact, the failures may be the writers' fault.
-- When the boy David takes on Goliath there's zero passion and righteous ferocity as is in the Biblical account (e.g. ""Who is this uncircumcized Philistine who would defy the armies of the living God?!!""). Plus the film doesn't show the serious trash-talking that went back and forth between the two. The fight's just too low key.

Although the gist of the story is accurate there are inaccuracies that some could nitpick, e.g. Goliath challenged David and the Israelites himself, he didn't speak through another man; David picked up stones before going out to fight the giant, not while fighting him; Absalom waited a long time before slaying Amnon, he didn't do it immediately; etc. Changes like these aren't that big of a deal and won't ruin your viewing experience unless you're completely [...] about it (sorry for my crudeness).

One reviewer criticized the film for showing Bathsheba at fault for seducing David. Actually, they both share fault equally. Everyone in Jerusalem knew the king stayed home while the troops were out fighting, so Bathsheba was likely fully aware that the king could catch a real nice tantalizing glimpse of her while she was bathing. Besides, even though David was the king, she could have said 'no' when the proposition of adultery later presented itself. In other words, she was both into it and into David.

FINAL ANALYSIS: I've seen ""King David"" 3 times now and enjoy it every time. It's a very worthwhile and well-done film account of David's life. Unfortunately the picture cuts off way more than it can chew in a mere 1 hour and 51 minutes, leaving the viewer detached from the characters and events, in particular those who know little about the biblical account.

Don't listen to those who absurdly rate the film less than 3/5 Stars. They're way off. Depending on your tastes, this is at least a 3/5 Star film. It's good (I give it a Grade of ""B""), it just lacks the oomph and detail to make it great.",1212796800,,4971,4.8103044496487115
229905,3,6300213927,"Synopsis: *See Hebrew Scriptures.

Critique: The '85 Biblical drama `King David' was a film with a lot of potential that unfortunately goes for the most part unrealized. Much like a tapestry, a film is comprised of many parts (cast, crew, production values, script, soundtrack, etc.) that must be meticulously woven into one flowing, indivisible garment if the director's vision is to be realized and the film successful with its target audience. So, where did this film fall short of my expectations?

Negatives:
1- While I'm usually a fan of Richard Gere I found his portrayal of David to be lackluster and totally unmotivated. I'm guessing he was attempting to appear righteous and contemplative but it comes across as bored and disinterested.
2- The editing is choppy and moves too abruptly. I found this lack of continuity to be disconcerting causing me to frequently lose focus and eventually interest in the ongoing storyline.
3- The intermittent narration used to fill in the missing pieces of the story and pertinent scripture verses gave the film a Sunday School feel that I didn't care for.
4- I think what bothered me the most was the total lack of passion in this production. There were no peak experiences, what I like to call ""I'm Spartacus"" moments that would set the film apart from others within the Biblical/religious genre.

Positives:
1- Excellent performance by Edward Woodward in the role of King Saul.
2- A surprisingly insightful ongoing monologue from David to God provides a unique look at the thought processes of this legendary Biblical figure.

Rating: If you like Biblically based films you'll probably enjoy this one well enough, but overall `King David' could have been much better; -3 1/2 Stars-.",1210118400,4,1730,5.038461538461538

But, the more I watched it, I honed in on the fall of Saul.  How a man's envy lead to his total ruin.

Of course, Gere is into the Dali Lama stuff now, but maybe he did this picture before he went into this area.  I remember seeing this movie when it first came out and it still keeps my attention to this day.

David did not scrabble on the ground for stones for his sling during the battle with Goliath, he collected them ahead of time. The affair with Bathsheba was at his idea and initiation, not hers.

This film tells the story of King David, the successor to King Saul and the founder of the Davidic line. It begins by showing Saul's disobedience and goes from there to David's anointing as king. Even so, David will not lift his hand against Saul who is also an anointed king. The film demonstrates David's strengths as well as his weaknesses.  He was a good man after God' own heart but he was by no means perfect. He pays for that imperfection.

This film is NOT the place to learn scripture but it does communicate the fundamentals of the story rather well and does so in a very viewable manner. It was enjoyable.",1149724800,31,921,4.312138728323699

229999,5,6300213927,"I have to admit that at first I did not know what to expect from this film, but as it turns out it was a very pleasant surprise.
The movie sheds light on ancient Israel's kings Saul and David.  In the process it deals with the dangerous fanatics of the time like the ""prophet"" Samuel who disapproved firstly of the appointment of any king since that would take away power from him and from the priesthood (the official excuse being that it would be offensive since god is the only ""king""), and of King Saul for ""daring"" to go against the vengeful Yahweh and negotiate a peace treaty with enemies as well as kill only the men and keep women and children as slaves, when according to Yahweh all ""heathens"" must be put to the sword and/or decapitated.  Lovely...
The film does a great job of describing life during the 10th century BC in Canaan, as well as the superstition, the fanaticism, and the fundamentalism that were so prevalent.
In addition, there is a very good portrayal of Saul as a weak king, constantly undermined by the priesthood and unable to unite the people behind him.
Conflicts, disputes, feuds, and back stabbings are all about.
What I found especially interesting is how brutal and exclusive they were (something which for years has been purposely hidden).  So well done to this film for doing the obvious i.e. accurately presenting what one really encounters in the Old Testament for a change instead of all these inaccurate happy-happy films that we are so used to seeing.
Richard Gere, Edward Woodward, Alice Krige, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a thought-provoking movie that can be watched over and over again!
The setting, the dialogues and the music are all wonderful!

230000,1,6300213927,"""Take heed to yourself and to the doctrine"" ""Test all things: hold fast what is good."" (1Tim4:16 & 2Thess5:21)

Unfourtunantely this is yet another Non-Biblical movie ""about the Bible"". It simply takes a basic outline of the Biblical story and slaps an entirely different message into it. I was appalled at how rebelious and unwise David was portrayed. David is sadly made out to be an arrogant, tempermental, self-willed, fit throwing man who continually displays a serious lack of understanding. In contrast to the Biblical David this movie David acts and speaks from the emptiness of an unbelieving heart and seems entirely subject to his emotions. This is far from the Biblical David who was a prophet himself, readily harkened to wisdom spoken whatever it's source, spoke by the Spirit of God and gave us most of the Psalms of the Bible. It is not possible that the things which come out of this movie David's mouth would ever had exited the mouth of the real/Biblical David. In the Bible (2 Samuel 12) when David stumbled and committed sin with the beautiful Bathsheba, God sent Nathan the prophet to point out to David his transgression - David was immediately humbled and repentant and was grieved with himself; however in this movie when Nathan comes to David, David flys into a childish rage and is unwilling to think he has done anything wrong (totally contrary to the Biblical David and the Spirit filled Christian's nature). If you know and love the Gospel of Jesus Christ, this movie will not (and can not) refresh the Spirit within you.

The message of this movie and the message placed falsley into David's mouth is 'follow every wave and turn of your own heart only and let that be your god' as oppose to God's living word written or spoken. The Bible says ""He who trusts in his own heart is a fool"" (Proverbs 28:26) and ""The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked"" (Jeremiah 17:9).  David said himself ""do not incline my heart to any evil thing, to practice wicked works...Let the righteous strike me; it shall be a kindness. And let him reprove me; it shall be as excellent oil; let my head not refuse it."" (Psalm 141:3+).

In my book...he steals the show from the deadpan Gere. You can tell he is a classicaly trained English actor and very professional. There is one scene when Saul is describing his relationship with God ""He [God] struggles with man during his life....but when you look for him He is gone"". Woodword gives a intense portrayal of a mentally overcome Saul struggling with his own sin and guilt. It is worth buying the film just for Woodwords performance if you ask me.

If you can get over Mical's (Saul's Daughter) boobs and Bathsheba's nude bathing scene...then this is not that bad of a film. Compared with the Passion of the Christ it is downright campy.",1142899200,9,993,4.516666666666667
230002,2,6300213927,"I've read the other reviews and I don't know what version they got but the DVD I received has more than a brief scene of David with his wife (breasts CLEARLY exposed)in bed. That scene alone would not be allowed in a PG-13 movie. There is another scene where David is viewing Bathsheba bathing. She is standing, completely nude and you can see everything. Then the camera pans in close for a ""waist up"" scene and Bathsheba and her female helper are washing her breasts and body.

This is diffinetly an R-rated scene. This movie is not biblically accurate as others have claimed. People need to read their bibles before making such a claim. There are many scenes that are accurate, but there are many that are not. One example is that in the movie Bathsheba wouldn't sleep with David while her husband was alive. Not true in scipture. In the bible, David saw her, had her called to the palace and slept with her. Then David sent a letter to have Uriah killed. Would of been a decent movie without the smut!",1138579200,5,1005,4.491803278688525
230003,3,6300213927,"King David was the Alexander of its day, a critically reviled epic that was damned more for what it got right than what it gets wrong. Critics at the time were aghast at the violence and ridiculed the scene where Richard Gere dances through the streets of Jerusalem in a loincloth, but in actuality both are straight from the Book of Kings and are considerably watered down: this David doesn't give his father-in-law hundreds of Philistines foreskins in return for the hand of his daughter, and the decimation of his enemies takes place safely offscreen. But the film's attitude to religion is strikingly grim. This isn't the cosy feelgood God of Sunday school but a vengeful, unforgiving God who orders genocide and abandons those He anoints. Both Saul and David fall from Grace, but strangely enough it's Saul's fall that really registers. Edward Woodward is superb in the role, and all too easily dominates the film in the face of little competition from some especially bland British and Irish actors.

Gere should be ideal casting for David's vanity at least, but he's a transparent presence in the film, lacking depth and over-reliant on his limited range of affectations. But he's not helped by the fact that David never becomes a character or even an active participant in his own life story: if anything, he is almost a bystander observing the deeds of others. After slaying Goliath, we never see him in battle or earning his reputation as a great king, and he doesn't feature in either of the two underwhelming battle scenes, a problem highlighted by intercutting them with shots of David miles away waiting to hear the result. As an epic, it's desperately underpopulated (they had major problems getting enough extras to the Italian locations), and you get the feeling at time that it's almost a picture made up of leftovers - the costumes were originally made for Scorsese's first abortive attempt to film The Last Temptation while the Ark of the Covenant probably has `Property of Indiana Jones' stamped inside it

Somewhere in there there's an idea fighting to get out about the search for God, but unfortunately it's so low-key and evenly paced that there are no real highs to the film. Carl Davis' score has its moments and it's not the turkey its reputation implies, but it never catches fire. As Bruce Beresford noted, they should have taken the hint when they started shooting in Israel only to get caught up in snowstorms - someone was definitely trying to tell them something!

The 2.35:1 DVD transfer is acceptable but not outstanding, although there are no extras.",1130544000,5,2587,4.875
230004,1,6300213927,". . .which bears only superficial resemblence to the story of King David as received by Jews and Christians for thousands of years.  Gere's portrayal of David has got to be one of his poorest efforts ever.

Whether one is a believer or not, the books of Samuel and Chronicles provide the basis for an excellent ""Life of David"".  Perhaps they should have been consulted!

One of the worst pictures I've ever seen.",1108339200,12,412,4.602739726027397
230005,5,6300213927,"When this film was released in 1985, the critics were not kind, but I love this film, and think it's a good telling of the story of David, based on I and II Samuel, I Chronicles, and the Psalms. Though much of it has been compressed (David's relationship with Bathsheba is limited mostly to the consequences of it for instance) and some creative license used for plot continuity, it has a tremendous amount of Biblical accuracy.
Taking place from 1000 to 961 B.C., the costuming, sets, and artifacts are fabulous; filmed in Pinewood Studios, U.K., and on location in Italy, the cinematography by Donald McAlpine is wonderful. The score is also lovely, by Carl Davis.
The brief nudity in the wedding chamber sequence has in my tape, been darkened so as to be imperceptible; either this is a flaw in the tape, or an effort not to offend and capture a wider audience, which would be silly, as this is a very mature drama. It contains much brutal violence making it unsuitable for children, and the confrontation with Goliath for example (which is exceptionally well done), is one of four beheadings.
Richard Gere is a marvelous David, and stands up well against an excellent international cast. He was thirty-five when this was filmed, and is about as handsome as a human has a right to be. The actor who shines above all though is Edward Woodward as Saul. He is riveting, and it's a brilliant character study of courage mixed with jealousy, revenge, and madness.
This is far from being a ""Big Bible Epic"" with lots of  well known stars, instead it's serious and beautifully acted, and perhaps arrived on the scene at the wrong time, that it was so unappreciated two decades ago. Total running time is 114 minutes.

230027,5,6300213927,"Fantastic Art Direction, High Production Values, and a Superb Cast and Crew make this film the most visually accurate Old Testament Story ever given the Big Screen Treatment. Whoever was the technical advisor for this film did an excellent job in recreating the period. Edward Woodward is Outstanding as Saul (most of the cast is British, which lends a certain archaic dignity to the dialogue). Richard Gere also does a great job as King David.
If you have a passion for Biblical or Historical Epics - this one delivers! The battle scenes (which are very well choreographed), chariot charges, and of course the duel between David and Goliath are all 'edge of the seat', 'toe curling action'

The sets look fine and the other actors do a decent job, but the actress playing Bathsheba was a let down--David destroyed himself and ruined his kingdom for this woman--- but the character is played in such a low key manner the veiwer never is made to see why. Another unintentionally funny scene is when Gere strips down to a loin cloth and does a disco routine before the Ark of the Covenant. All in all, this was not a high point in Richard Gere's up and down career.",1034899200,,594,4.409090909090909
230031,4,6300213927,"I appreciated the attempt in 1985 to bring King David to life. I think outstanding perfomance go to Denis Quilley (Samuel) and Edward Woodward(Saul). The biggest turn off for me in watching a Bible movie is the glazed over eyes, slow ""righteous"" speech patterns that Gere and many others continue to do in these types of films. Come on Hollywood these were real, historical people in extroardinary situations not bleary eyed monsters from a b-movies! The movie does make errors like Davids destruction of his Temple model and the unecessary nudity. The one thing i did appreciate is the cinematography. I like the crisp look of the early 80's films. I don't like the new TNT films because they use some funky-weird orangish, red filter on their cameras. What? Did the Bible events take place on the red planet? I also appreciated the scene in the Gere film with David vs. Goliath (tall actor). The TNT film on David put the actor playing Goliath on a rock to make him look taller.

Also, as I recall, it was rather biblically accurate...but, I thought Disney did a better job portraying Moses life in THE PRINCE OF EGYPT, than was done with this flick...",1008115200,3,530,4.557894736842106

Without seeing it first, I gathered a bunch of women together to view it.  We were all so disappointed.  Content, acting, background, gratuitous scenes, and lack of cohesion to the original script--the Bible--gives it a bad taste in my mouth.  I wish I could recommend this with such enthusiasm as it was recommended to me, but I cannot.  If purchased anyway, please do so with caution if you plan on watching it with children present.

After Saul's demise David welcomes the Ark back with celebratory dance. He aspires to build God a residence as opposed to the tent in which a the Ark resides. He sees a woman bathing and soon takes her as if she were spoils of war. His prophet tells him did the wrong thing so he is punished, meanwhile his son assaults his half-sister and he is exiled. The son aspires to take over the kingdom with the result being he is hacked from a tree.

At times this is a beautiful retelling of the Biblical story, at other times it plays fast and loose with the details. We occasionally get to see passion of the characters.
