892090,3,6304494416,"This is what I'd call Pretty Good Ernest. Not up to the level of Brilliant Ernest (e.g. ""Ernest Rides Again""), but better than Banal Ernest (e.g. ""Slam Dunk Ernest"").
If you're already an Ernest fan, you'll probably get a kick out of this movie. If you're just getting started on Ernest, I'd recommend one of ""Ernest Rides Again"", ""Ernest Goes to School"", ""Ernest Goes to Camp"", or ""Ernest Goes to Jail.""",999561600,6,404,4.704225352112676
892091,4,6304494416,"Ernest is back, but this one wasn't as good as most Ernests but definatly better than Ernest Scared Stupid and Slam Dunk Ernest.  There were a few  things I didn't like, though.  I didn't like the woman who cared about her  car, she was a jerk.  And when Ernest made that Yo-Yo the ""Eyes""  he made it out of became a compleatly different shape.  And Ostrich eggs  don't break that easily (you can stand on one and it still wouldn't  break!).  Dispite these things, it was still pretty good!",967334400,,490,4.404494382022472
892092,4,6304494416,"No man has been able to entertain like Jim Varney. His Ernest character is able to get infinite laughs (at least from me) in his films. The great thing about these movies is that it can be enjoyed on so many levels.  Children as well as adults. Each addition to the Ernest series is a  masterpiece. In this film, Ernest visits Africa and his humor shines  through in so many different ways. A sure fire hit if you're looking for a  film to watch with the kids or a group of friends.",963964800,2,482,4.206521739130435

892182,5,6304494416,"Ernest, the original Jim Carrey.  A one of a kind that you feel like you know already.  I haven't met a boy under the age of 10 that didn't think Ernest was hilarious.  There's nothing special about one Ernest movie over another Ernest movie.  If you like Ernest, it doesn't matter what the movie is about, it's funny.  Oh, and I would ad, as funny as Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) when I compare Ernest to him, I have to give Ernest a higher goofy silliness score.  We just watched this again after YEARS and its just as funny, maybe funnier, than I remember.  But I'm strange that way.  As are most pre-10 year-old boys.",1380585600,,617,4.350877192982456

892247,5,6304494416,It's so nice to sit with my young grandchildren and laugh at a movie that I can trust. Ernest is such a gem! Innocent and loving in a very funny way. I loved this movie!,1323820800,,169,3.857142857142857
892248,4,6304494416,Hey any Ernest movie is going to be pretty lowbrow but you should know that going in. This is typical Ernest and it is funny too me.,1315785600,,132,3.925925925925926
892249,5,6304494416,My 13 year old son and I both loved this movie.  If you like Earnest movies you'll like this one.  Our favorites are this one and Scared Stupid.  You probably won't like this though if you don't have kids.  It's not something that normal adults would sit around and watch together without children.,1135036800,,298,4.566037735849057
892250,2,6304494416,"I've always pretty much liked the Ernest movies. Yes, they are silly and whatnot but they were always funny and I can't think of another actor who can make such funny faces. Unfortunately, in this one the budget was seemed to have been kept to a maximum of about 200 bucks. It's very low budget and it was dissappointing to see Ernest in something so stupid.
The story was cheesy, flimsy, and stupid. The actors (excluding Ernest himself) were horrible, and it was altogether just cheesy. Ernest also wasn't very funny in this one at all. His co-star, that dumb waitress who goes along with Ernest to Africa was so mean and stupid I just wanted to slap her across the face. Anyways, there's not much to say about this movie except if you want some real Ernest, I'd suggest ""Ernest goes to Jail"",""Ernest Scared Stupid"", or ""Ernest goes to school.""",1046217600,11,846,4.6092715231788075
892251,4,6304494416,"One of the series' best finds the ""Everyman handyman"" in love and on the run from a vicious band of jewel thieves.  It's great to see Ernest in such an exotic setting.",1037404800,,167,4.21875
892252,4,6304494416,"In this film, Ernest wants a date with Renee, the waitress at a local diner.  She considers herself to deserve more than this Mr. Nobody.  At the advice of the other waitress, Ernest tries to win Renee's heart with a gift.  Unfortunately, while shopping for the gift, he gets mixed up in a jewel theft involving stolen African treasure.  That lands both Renee and Ernest in Africa, where they must try to evade capture by competing teams of jewel thieves.  While in Africa, Ernest gets to try out an extended scene with the old lady in the green dress, and he does a masterful job as an Indian swami.
The first time I saw this movie, I thought it lacked continuity. I found it somewhat strange to see Indians, Arabs, and Brits mixed in with the African characters, and I thought that Varney had gotten his geography thoroughly confused this time.  I also found the stereotypes that he was playing with a bit offensive- -many of the characters certainly aren't politically correct.  However, after seeing the film again after living years in the Middle East, I can now recognize the characters easily, and they are incredibly realistic and very funny indeed.  Varney must have spent some time in East Africa before making this film.  While he was there, he no doubt visited an Arabic palace in Zanzibar, had some run-ins with Indian servants and British hunters, and met some friendly tribesmen who taught him some key phrases in a Bantu language.  Unlike some of Ernest's more kid-centered movies, this film doesn't have a moral theme.  It's just Ernest on safari.",1026777600,7,1564,4.7555555555555555

7873189,5,6304494416,"Love Bradley Cooper. He has done so many great movies and Broadway and T.V.. But ask yourself could he do what Jim Varney does in this movie -if you answered a resounding NO than this movie is for you . Mr. Varney's timing, delivery and facial expressions are difficult to match.
He is able to take a mediocre script to different heights and I emphasis different. If Bradley Cooper wants to win that Academy Award than I dare him to remake this or any of the ""Ernest "" movies-wait take that back-Double Dare him -let's see what your made of Mr. Bradley Cooper.",1449446400,2,560,4.446601941747573
