1227262,2,B00000IPGX,Boring and predictable. 17 more words required.  Boring and pretty stupid. Glad I didn't to go theater to pay for it.,1373155200,,117,4.571428571428571
1227263,3,B00000IPGX,I didn't finish this one - predictable slow plot left me dozing off and realizing I did not miss anything,1362441600,,105,4.3
1227264,4,B00000IPGX,"This was also a pretty good thriller.  It Stars Tim Matheson and Mimi Rogers.  You'll ask yourself is she a blackwidow or some crazy
woman, or is she dreaming this.  He is someone that's wife has died and he meets this woman and the rest you'll have to watch.  I won't give it away.  I recommend this also.",1276473600,2,306,4.206896551724138
1227265,4,B00000IPGX,Enjoyed the movie. Probably would have been rated PG13. No nudity or bad language. Picture quality was a bit grainy.,1232496000,8,116,4.85

1227282,3,B00000IPGX,"It was a kind of film noir with a modern twist.  It would've been a tough script to carry with poor actors because it was a little too
predictable and cheesy at times, (with the sax playing in the background).  No surprises, a good fluff movie.",1413676800,,244,4.282608695652174
1227283,5,B00000IPGX,Love Tim Matheson...so I very much enjoyed this movie.,1410998400,,54,5.111111111111111

1227285,3,B00000IPGX,"A man named William (Tim Matheson- ANIMAL HOUSE, IMPULSE, SOMETIMES THEY COME BACK), grieving the loss of his wife, attempts suicide on a speeding train, only to be saved by a beautiful woman (Mimi Rogers- GINGER SNAPS, TV's THE X-FILES). Within seconds after his rescue, the two are naked, and Bill feels a lot better! They disembark together, but the mysterious woman leaves William at the station. Meanwhile, the police are investigating the murder of a man in a hot tub that just might be connected to the woman. William tracks her down and finds out that her name is Ali Broussard. They soon meet up again, sultry saxophones play, and the two pick up where they left off on the train. Man, these two get along VERY well for a couple of strangers! THOSE BEDROOM EYES (aka: A KISS TO DIE FOR) uses seduction, danger, and murder in an attempt to build tension. Unfortunately, due to its meandering plot, it feels like it's 6 hours long! The lead detective (William Forsythe- THE DEVIL'S REJECTS) is slowly closing in on Ali. He knows something about her that William doesn't even suspect. More murders occur, all w/ the same M.O. Cue those sexy saxophones. Three things I learned from this movie are 1- Mimi Rogers is H-O-T!  2- Never underestimate the power of lust. 3- Always listen to your cat. While listless and overly talky, it does have its moments, mostly involving homicide. I just wish it had centered more on the murder mystery aspect, rather than the mushy, lovey stuff. I did enjoy the twist toward the end though. Oh well...",1390608000,5,1540,4.682656826568266
1227286,4,B00000IPGX,"Mimi Rogers always keeps you enthralled, waiting for the next scene.
I only viewed a couple of her movies, I hope to catch up and see all of them.",1390435200,,146,4.068965517241379
1227287,3,B00000IPGX,"I liked this movie because I like Mimi Rogers. The acting was average and the story line was rather predictable. Overall, this is a good movie.",1380844800,,143,4.538461538461538

7911244,4,B00000IPGX,It was a little slow starting off. Very unexpected ending. I would recommend it if you're into suspense dramas.,1474675200,,111,4.894736842105263

7911249,3,B00000IPGX,good story but acting was just so so. Ok for an evening one... Not for children.,1441756800,,80,4.0625
7911250,1,B00000IPGX,"I love Mimi Rogers, which is the only possible excuse for watching this schizoid clunker. I much as I can make sense of the plot, boy meets girl (as he's about to suicide); boy has sex with girl; girl turns out to be two girls in one attractive body; bad girl is killing older men in belated revenge for being raped by her father; love doesn't quite conquer all, as both good and bad girl go to the criminal justice system, though any good lawyer should be able to cop an insanity plea.",1433116800,,486,4.236559139784946
7911251,1,B00000IPGX,"There haven't been many good psychological thrillers. This isn't one of them. Save your money on this one. If you must watch this, do it if you can for free. If you watch this for free, thank me later. If you pay for this.....
I warned you.",1432425600,,240,4.127659574468085
