7814297,5,630157463X,I'm a huge 3 stooges fan. I love them. It's a shame that they are not alive anymore.  Stooges #1,1367884800,,96,3.8
7814298,4,630157463X,"The Hot Scots - A good film, that has the potential to be great but gets slowed down by the fright takes that dominate the last several minutes of the short. Still a good one though, and Shemp gets off a few good one-liners when the boys meet the Earl. 4 stars

Fuelin' Around - A great film, especially in the first several minutes that focus on the stooges carpentry gags. What could be better than watching Larry cutting Moe's shoe with a pair of scissors and Moe's frightened reaction when he thinks his toes are gone. Larry gets a chance to shine a bit in the spotlight & he does an excellent job. 4 1/2 stars

Hula La La - A good effort from producer Hugh McCollum who directs his first and only stooge film. It makes you wonder how well he could've done if Columbia had not given him and Ed Bernds the gate in 1952. 4 stars

Overall, this is a good collection that should please Shemp fans or just stooge fans in general. A four star tape.",1326067200,,946,4.2154696132596685

7814300,4,630157463X,"THE HOT SCOTS (1948) and FUELIN'AROUND (1949) in my opinion, are two of the best Three Stooges films ever made. HULA-LA-LA (1951) is an okay short, it has it's moments, but forget the headhunter plot.
THE HOT SCOTS (1948) is in my top five Three Stooges films because it's fast-paced and has lots of funny dialogue. The Stooges apply for jobs at the Scotland yard and wind up getting a job guarding a castle. Footage of this short was used in SCOTCHED IN SCOTLAND (1954) and HOT ICE (1955).
FUELIN' AROUND (1949) is in my top ten shorts because of all the funny stuff that happens. The one problem is that the scene where Shemp is being stretched ten feet is too long and this was fixed in the remake HOT STUFF (1956) which isn't as good as this classic.
HULA-LA-LA (1951) is the worst short on the tape, but still okay. It has it's moments. Could've been better, the worst Shempm film.
Overall, I think the first two shorts are excellent. Too bad they had to put HULA-LA-LA on the tape as well.",1007596800,,995,4.413043478260869
7814301,5,630157463X,"THE HOT SCOTS (1948) - Edward Bernds makes another great detective short here.  A lot of funny scenes in the castle, and a great supporting cast, too.  The ending is hilarious.
FUELIN' AROUND (1949) - Larry gets a great chance to shine in this short since he's given a little more attention, which I'm happy to see.  I always felt he was a little underrated.  He has a lot of classic lines here.  The scene towards the end with Shemp being stretched out to nearly 5 extra feet is also a hoot. Great short.
HULA-LA-LA (1951) - Another first-rate-er.  The only Stooge short that producer Hugh McCollum directed, and he did a very excellent job here.  There's a very nice touch at the end with the jungle music that plays in the last scene, being played over the ending credits, instead of the usual ""Three Blind Mice"" music.  McCollum should've been given the chance to direct some more shorts. Even more proof that Columbia giving him and Bernds the gate in 1952 and letting Jules White take over was a horrible mistake.",994291200,2,1019,4.56043956043956
7814302,4,630157463X,"I would give this tape 5 stars, but then there wouldn't be any difference between these very funny Shemp episodes and the extremely fine ones, the classics, most of which had Curly.
The best on this tape, in my opinion,  is ""Hula-la-la"" (a near classic), where three dance instructors  are hired by a Hollywood Studio and sent to a South Sea Island to teach the  natives to dance. (The natives just happen to be cannibals.)
In  ""Fuelin' Around"" Larry is mistaken for a brilliant professor.  Foreign spies try to get his secret formula for rocket fuel. The real  professor and the spies are about as smart as the stooges  themselves.
""Hot Scots"" is a great skit (also nearing classic  proportions), has some good jokes at the expense of the Scottish, and a  good Scotland Yard spoof. McMoe, McLarry and McShemp get hired as  ""yard men"" and end up as sleuths in a haunted Scottish castle  full of McSurprises.
This one is definitely worth buying.",925603200,4,944,4.695121951219512
