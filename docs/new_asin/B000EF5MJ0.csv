2517496,4,B000EF5MJ0,"The video of ""Secrets of UFOs: Area 51 Base"" was well done with alot of information to support the video.  There was alot of people who I have seen in previous videos like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/UFOs-Area-51-Secrets-Of-The-Black-World/dp/B00014NEJ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">UFOs & Area 51: Secrets Of The Black World</a>&nbsp;who said the excact same thing and must have taken the video clip from this one and used it in this video.  This video is in the same series as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secrets-of-UFOs-Roswell-UFO-Crash/dp/B000E991KW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secrets of UFOs: Roswell UFO Crash</a>&nbsp;and some of the information was the same.  It was produced and made by the same company.  Overall, I was happy with the video and thought it was a good review and summary of what I already have seen previously.  It is  a must for any UFO seeker.",1187395200,13,963,6.484375
2517497,5,B000EF5MJ0,"This is short, about 50 min or so, but its to the point.  With all the research I have been doing, its also on the mark.  This comes off as serious and informative as well.  At such a low cost, it well worth it to buy.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1173484800,8,248,3.803921568627451

8108974,4,B000EF5MJ0,Everybody knows about AREA 51. I just wish they would stop the lies and let people know what really goes on there. If it were just about planes there would be no big secret there. They are hiding something there.,1435795200,,212,4.325

8108978,5,B000EF5MJ0,"The DvD was highly information and helpful into shedding light about the little known AF operating location near Groom lake.  The unacknowledged (black) programs will always be so compartmentalized and highly classified within the DoD that it takes real hero's to discuss and disclose the possible crimes and/or coverups inside the base.

The evidence continues to mount which raises the support that we have had interplanetary visitations by extraterrestrial biological beings.",1369612800,,478,5.71830985915493
8108979,4,B000EF5MJ0,"video is very informative, it contains very good interviews, and some interesting footage. It stays on track and keeps you interested. After watching this video you will be open to the possibility of something very bizarre going on at Area 51, if you aren't already of course. I would recommend this video for anyone who has interest in Area 51, UFO's, or conspiracies in general. I would have liked to see more detail on the sat. photos and detailed comments from a good photo analyst. Anyway, I highly recommend this DVD. At such a low cost, it well worth it to buy.",1211155200,,568,4.578431372549019
8108980,5,B000EF5MJ0,"This DVD was well done and interesting.  It contains documented items and interviews/comments by creditable people (Lazar, Adair, etc.).  The DVD is reasonably priced and well worth it.  It isn't very long (less than a hour).  I would have liked to see more detail on the sat. photos and detailed comments from a good photo analyst.  Anyway, I highly recommend this DVD.",1197417600,8,370,4.903225806451613
