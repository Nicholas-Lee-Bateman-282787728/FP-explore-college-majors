7305743,5,B0106V55Z2,"This Russian language movie is a well filmed tale (with English subtitles) about a very determined young Soviet Russian woman who volunteered for very personal WWII wartime sniper combat.  She was a citizen of 1941 Russian state socialism.  Today,  it could or might seem strange that Ukrainian Russian Lyudmila Pavlichenko was awarded the supreme medal: Hero the the Soviet Union.  The bestial NAZIs had that effect on others: uniting almost humanity against them.  As a Soviet heroine, 2LT Lyuda lived a simple human story and she luckily survived a long, war. In fact, 25,000,000 Soviet citizens did not survive it.  Everyone knows ... that the 1941-42 fighting on the EASTERN FRONT had no traces of any humanity.  In the killing role on the front line against NAZIs or a in later talking role traveling to the U.S.A. (in order gain support for WWII shipments of American military aid),  2LT Pavlichenko truly served her nation well.
  The message of this war film is rather unique in that it shows much more of feeling than it shows of fighting.  Yet, it does briefly show details about how a sniper hides and then acts killing in the field.  Miss Pavlicenko, a female, succeeded as a top WWII sniper ACE with confirmed 309 kills.  She was a real life woman who had feelings, who shared emotions with her friends, and who could really love others and hate others.  This movie shows:  WAR, LOSS, PAIN, WORK, WASTE, HARDSHIP, DUTY, LOVE, and SERVICE which were all performed by a remarkable old time woman.
  This is a Russian film made for a Russian audience.  Western movies are usually edited more smoothly with fewer ""jumping around switches"" in story continuity.  For example, watch the movie ""ENEMY AT THE GATES"".  More realistic, bloody war films like ""COMPANY 9"", ""THE IRON CROSS"", ""STALAG 17"", and ""SCHINDLER'S LIST"" more clearly demonstrate to viewers that war ... waste and stupidity is not fun ... nor inspiring to watch.  ACTUALLY ... real WARFARE is HELL ... and it is written by ""survivors"".  America Medal of Honor military heroes all salute their fallen buddies as the real heroes ...  who are buried far away ... and who never got back home.  Warfare never turns out the way ... that the first leaders  forecast ... or expected ... as the final end result.",1461542400,12,2276,4.804123711340206

CGI was not the best but sufficed, acting was pretty good. What I didn't like was how the soundtrack is half in English underneath the spoken Russian ( an English soundtrack would be nice).

with our protagonist female war hero, for war-bonds. They enter into a livelong friendship, after surviving the struggle of a ""culture clash"".
Some of the actors are American, the remaining cast is Russian and German actors. The action takes place in flashbacks, something that needs to get used to, for western viewers. A movie that was produced in the Russian federation to commemorate the seventieth anniversary of the end of World War II.
Action 5 stars
Acting 5 stars
story 4 stars
title selection 3 stars, because the movie is not a docu drama about the battle of Sevastopol, more a bio pic of our protagonist female sniper war
hero. The movie also shows a few episode of her teenage years, before the war.
Nevertheless, the overall impression is a lasting one, that will or might change western conceptions of how and why the soviet army prevailed.
I like to point out, that this movie is not a propaganda movie praising soviet communism, that viewers are accustomed from the soviet period.
It just and only tells the war from a Russian perspective, that is very rarely seen in the movie theaters of the west.",1445731200,24,1261,4.815668202764977

7305752,2,B0106V55Z2,I was expecting a more stirring account about one woman's valiant struggle against the fascists.  But there were a couple of scenes in which she (Lyuda) became giddy with bloodlust and indifferently killing obviously severely wounded and non-threatening germans during battle.  The scene in which she and her boyfriend killed a bunch of germans who were celebrating Christmas just was not awe-inspiring and paradoxically made the germans more sympathetic to behold.,1441497600,7,465,5.535211267605634

7305759,4,B0106V55Z2,"Battle For Sevastopol.

Sevastopol (pronounced Sev-a-sto-pol) is that major city in the Crimean Peninsula on the shore of the Black Sea.  The British fought a war there in 1853,  famed for the poem Charge Of The Light Brigade, for the Town of Balaclava, and for the winter head-gear called balaclava.  In 1941 it was the scene of resistance that stalled the German Army long enough to miss the opportunity to take Stalingrad (and hence, lose the war).

I understand that the story is biographical. It begins in pre-war 1938 and introduces Ludmilla, a twenty-something girl who shows some skill with a rifle. Consequently her father, a military officer, arranged for her to receive training as a sniper.  It was up-front that the government saw her as a future propaganda tool. About that time war with Germany started (Sept. 1940) and Ludmilla was inducted and sent to the Crimean Peninsula (location of the Russian fleet) as part of the delaying action mentioned above. The movie here becomes a typical war movie (not to make light of history) and the Ludmilla performs beyond anyones expectation.

Now, the reality is also that, in a war, government wishes cant add 10 seconds to your life, by which I mean that surviving a year and scoring 300 fatalities is based on some actual skill beyond 99% luck. In any case I think it is fair to think (and the movie implies) that what Ludmilla did and said came from inside and was not pasted on - - i.e. when later asked to make a speech, she doesnt read the prepared script.

My interest in the story was piqued at this point because another bit of history comes to light, of which I was unaware at the time.  Ludmilla is sent to America as part of an effort to bring America into the War.  At this point she meets Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, wife of the President Roosevelt, and famed in her own right for sponsoring not-entirely-popular social causes.  Mrs. Roosevelt introduces Ludmilla to the concept of something like Positive Thinking - - i.e. when faced with opposition to your ideas, smile and carry on as if you didn't hear them.  (I hope I interpreted her fairly - - in any case she scored points with me on that subject.)

The story is told as a flash-back, beginning in 1958 when Mrs. Roosevelt visited Moscow to meet the new leader, Mr. Khrushchev, on what matter is not said (and his war-time predecessor is carefully never mentioned).

7305760,1,B0106V55Z2,"Movie promotes anti-Semitic myth that Jews refused to fight in the war.
Historically inaccurately portrays Lyudmila Pavlichenko married to a Jew who doesn't want to go to war. Her actual husband was not Jewish.",1488844800,,210,5.205882352941177
7305761,1,B0106V55Z2,"This movie is rather boring, acting is terrible, it is not entirely based on facts, and it pushes a vicious antisemitic lie.

According to the Russian Wikipedia, Lyudmila Pavlichenko was born Lyudmila Belova in 1916. In 1932 she married Alexei Pavlichenko and they had a son.

The movie presents her as an innocent young woman in 1941, as she is dating a Jewish man.  This man and his relatives speak with an exaggerated Jewish accent.  When the war starts, Pavlichenko wants to go to the front to fight Germans, but her Jewish fianc does not.

This movie plot, which is not based on any facts, propagates a vicious antisemitic lie that Jews would rather stay behind and let other people to do the fighting.  The simple fact is that Jews - despite their numbers - had the highest percentage of the Heroes of Soviet Union (the highest military award) among other nations of the USSR, despite widespread Soviet policy of not recognizing their valiant conduct.

It is quite shameful that such a movie is made nowadays and is being shown in America and throughout the world.",1488672000,,1070,4.720430107526882

There is nothing romantic about war, you either do what you have to do to go home, or you go in the ground. I thought it was a great movie across the board. The female lead did a phenomenal job.

7305771,5,B0106V55Z2,"This review is about the movie with the soundtrack in russian.
The script of the movie is pretty close to the real story of Lyudmila Pavlichenko - the most successful female sniper (309 kills) of Ukrainian Soviet origin. Verified it against both english and russian wikipedia.
There is a lot of killings and shooting in the movie but the psychological aspects prevail. The hatred to fascists as a phenomenon is shown very well. But the individual fascists are shown as ordinary people - they have families, they suffer injuries badly, they die in the same way as their opponents. This is a pretty atypical way of showing the fascists in russian movies. Well done for that!
The role of Lyudmila Pavlichenko is played brilliantly.
Pretty tragic movie - all close friends who take care of Lyudmila are being killed one after another throughout the story. Indeed this reinforces the feeling of loss.
One of the key messages - the desire to live and optimism are key to survive even during the deadliest time. In that sense, the movie promotes the optimistic approach to life and positive outcome despite the tragic events described in it. This echoes with the style of Crime and Punishment by Dostoevsky.
There were no russians and ukrainians in those times. They were Soviets and they treated each other as equals. I know this from the direct participants of those events not just from the movie. In that sense the movie is a reminder that Ukraine and Russia are blood-related (at least after the blood they shed fighting together). I'm truly happy that this movie was created by Ukrainians and Russians together.

One of the reviewers mentions ""propaganda"" in the movie. I'd rather call it a political aspect - question about so long delayed opening of the Western front. If you would like to find the answer then please study the story of opening the Western front told by both sides - the allies (US, UK) and Russia.
Fortunately or not, but this question links pretty strongly to the nowadays relationships between the West and Russia.",1476835200,,2035,4.830945558739255

7305776,5,B0106V55Z2,"I love this movie. Russian movies are not about big explosions, impossible stunts or incredible numbers of people shot. Russian movies are about human interactions, emotion, and passion. Like real life! One could think that a film about a woman sniper would have the majority of the film shown as an American film. But this is a Russian movie, and the woman sniper's life, with its difficulties and triumphs, is shown with passion and emotion. I could watch this movie many times and never get tired of it. This is about the quiet bond between two women, both successful in their own right, and how important that bond was to each of them. And in the meantime, Lyudmila Pavlichenko leaves her student life and becomes one of the deadliest snipers in the Russian military. But as part of her life, not the only thing in her life.",1468281600,6,828,4.639455782312925
7305777,4,B0106V55Z2,"Lyudmila Pavlichenko is a good student who can never match the ideals of her austere NKVD, Officer father. Then war breaks out and it is discovered that she is a crack shot. So she is made to join the snipers after the Germans invade in 1941 through Operation Barbarossa. She is also a woman with the needs of such and has already attracted a few suitors, one is aspiring doctor  however, she is more enamoured with her commanding officer.

The fates of war mean that you must seize today what may be gone tomorrow and that is a theme that is more or less a constant throughout this. It follows the plight of the Russians as they retreat across their vast country until they are able to build up their forces to give the invading Nazis the righteous kicking they so keenly deserve. This though ends with the stand at Sevastopol and Lyudmilas personal and actual battles on and off the field of battle.

Now the action scenes are all very good, the character development is fine too. The acting is all above average and the CGI is good in most parts. Some of the Americans are dubbed though which I always find annoying but that is a small gripe for what is in the main part a really good war film with full on emotions thrown in for added pathos and drama; this is not up to the calibre of say The Admiral but is still deserving of a watch  recommended.",1465257600,4,1353,4.357142857142857
