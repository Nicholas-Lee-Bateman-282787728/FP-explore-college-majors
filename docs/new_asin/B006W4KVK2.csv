5022095,3,B006W4KVK2,"Nice movie for children that love the Lalaloopsy franchise.  The downside, though, is that this movie does not have subtitles.  I can't believe that in this day and age, movie makers still make movies with no thought to those that cannot hear, especially a child's movie.",1332633600,6,271,4.869565217391305
5022096,5,B006W4KVK2,"The Lalaloopsy dolls are huge right now, and they have finally made the transition from toy to the little screen.  It was rather successful, if you are looking for a cute, completely inoffensive movie that anyone can watch.  The main seven original Lalaloopsy dolls are the focus of the movie, along with Rosy Bumps and Bruises and four of the Lalaloopsy littles - the sister dolls and all of their respective pets.  It's the little sisters that make the show so cute and adorable, as they toddle around, saying things in a childish, simple manner that's quite endearing and very much like little bitty sisters do.  The older Loopsies are very sweet and understanding.  They have all personalities but are definitely nice girls, every single one of them, and they play off well with each other.  This is a refreshing change from having a few ""nasty"" characters in the mix, like with other series.  In Lalaloopsy Land, everyone is considerate, caring and nice.

The plot is all about Peanut Big Top's surprise she is going to show everyone at dark.  The girls can't wait and are passing the time until then when they notice that Pillow Featherbed went off to find a ball they were playing with and didn't come back.  They organize a search for her and get caught up in some sew sweet antics and a little storm along the way.  Don't worry, nothing harrowing has happened to Pillow, she's simply napping again, as she seems a touch narcoleptic.  The simple story is wrapped up nice with a happy ending and a great big bow.  Some of the cinematography was quite impressive as well, with some unusual camera angles and transitions, as the camera follows the animals around.  This made a nice touch.  It's also done in flash-like animation style, which is a relief after the deluge of poorly done CGI movies. This one doesn't look like it was done in someone's basement on 1990s computers (like the Bratz series, which has horrible animation), it has a paper doll kind of style that really suits the characters, and everything is bright and smooth, and in widescreen to boot!

Adventures in Lalaloopsy Land: The Search for Pillow is good spirited fun.  Older girls will like it because it is about their favorite characters, and the littlest ones can watch it with their sisters because there really is nothing objectionable at all about this movie.  Nothing.  It is pure sew sweetness from start to finish.  Which is really nice, as there are not a lot of movies that can appeal to a wide range of youngsters out there these days.  A very relaxing movie, and quite enjoyable.  It's one long ""D'aaaaaaaaaaaw"".",1331164800,28,2603,4.725055432372505

5022128,3,B006W4KVK2,"The kids love it.  My issue is that the movie is of...really cheap production.  Once the movie is playing it's normally okay, but even when the disk was brand new it played like it was damaged.  All the Lalaloopsy movies are the same.  There are random skips, break ups of the image, times where it just won't play...  But other than that, the actual movie is really great for younger kids. The story is slow and obvious with loud, memorable voice acting and not a lot of distractions happening so your child actually follows along.",1402963200,,532,4.557894736842106

The Search for Pillow is a light hearted movie and entertaining. Little girls will love it. You cannot go wrong with this movie. There is not much substance to it, but all of the shows (10 episodes on Nick Jr. so far) are the same. Oh well. My 4 year old loves it! And I appreciate the dolls are helpful to one another. One thing: the sing along song on the dvd is different than the theme song on the show. Wonder why? We like the song on the tv show better.",1372118400,,578,4.123893805309734

We watched it together and I can't begin to tell you how much I appreciate this movie.  With all of the obnoxious movies/tv shows out there *cough*DORA*SPONGEBOB*, excuse me, this Lalaloopsy movie is refreshing.  It's gentle in it's approach.  The music gets exciting (not a fan of the obvious synthesized instruments - the trumpet part of the theme song) but they don't overdo that or the background music/effects.  There are often subtle sounds of birds chirping and the voice actors don't shout.  The animation is adorable and very creative.  My daughter seems to love every character in Lalaloopsy Land, but I have a favorite: Sheep (Pillow's pet).  There are plenty of obstacles that the characters have to overcome.

After my aunt purchased this movie for my kids, I LOVE them. This is the sweetest, cutest, most adorable little movie since the Wonder Pets!! I cannot say how amazed I was! It was perfectly innocent and sweet!!! In this world, that is hard to find, even in kids cartoons. I am very strict with what my children watch, but I would recommend this to any parent. I even think it's cute and have suggested for family movie night twice since they got it.

They love the story and all the characters! Everyone in the movie is kind to one another, just a super positive film!

5022203,4,B006W4KVK2,"My son saw this movie at the store and wanted it. I had never heard of these toys before. it is very slow, and the characters are kind of strange. Why is there not a single character of color? Kind of bugs me they can have purple hair but only white skin? Any way, there is nothing educational about this, but they speak slow and it has this hypnotic music that plays every so often. We put this on and the kids are out in a matter of minutes.

5022207,4,B006W4KVK2,"My daughter and I love lalaloopsy dolls so it was exciting to get the movie. The animation is absolutely lovely! Nice coloring, movement is neat and natural, and the voices are terrific. However, the writing is not good. Within the first four minutes the same gag is used three times: ""Watch out for the--! Apple tree/snowball/etc."" The storyline did not need Peanut's special surprise as it creates a useless plot diversion. Maybe I'm nitpicking here, but with the current rolling of superb children's movies/shows coming out, I expected much better from this franchise. My daughter gets bored about halfway through (The movie itself is also too long. Maybe it should be in shorts like the webisodes?) and turns it off.
In this case, I feel that the lalaloopsy dolls would suit better as a tv show. With better writers.",1343692800,,820,4.906474820143885

5022213,5,B006W4KVK2,"My daughter just turned 3. She is obsessed with the new Strawberry Shortcake, Barbie Movies and Dora Dora Dora!!! She has never cared for dolls in the past, but shortly before her 3rd birthday last month this movie came on her favorite channel, Nick Jr. She sat and watched the entire thing. My niece has really been into collecting LalaLoopsy dolls and I had previously tried to talk Piper into them because I personally was so interested in them and her cousin seems to love them so much. While watching TV one day she saw the commercial for the Mermaid Lala and it was the only thing she asked for for her birthday. So of course she ended up with the Mermaid and 3 other Lalaloopsies. SHE IS HOOKED!!! She loves every single one she gets and keeps all of their little pets with them at all times. She insists on going to sleep watching the movie while sleeping with several of the dolls, including Pillow. I've never seen her care more for a toy/s in her life and now she wants them all. I wished I would have had the insight to DVR the movie off of Nick Jr. but I had no idea what an impact it would have on her. As a matter of fact, I'm kind of glad we didn't DVR it because its nice to have the DVD for her. This DVD came with a little extra prize : a mini Pillow Featherbed. She really liked that extra perk and we only spent 15 bucks for it at Walmart. She watches the movie over and over and over. I have to admit that I even like the movie, but like all adults, get slightly annoyed with it by about the 3rd go around of the day. lol. It has a cute storyline about the original Lalaloopsies with Rosy Bumps and Bruises as well trying to find Pillow (who only ever wants to take naps) so that she can also enjoy a suprize that Peanut Big Top (the circus Lala) has for everyone. Of course everything comes together. My daughter also has a Pillow doll and loves to take her sheep and count to 5 with it just like in the movie, which is impressive for a 3 year old. The only complaints I have is that I have to fast foward through about 8 previews for movies we have no interest in every single time we start it for her and its a pain! Also...my daughter's favorite Lala is Jewels and in the movie she seems to be the only one who is a bit of a jerk. lol. My daughter also loves that all of the pets are in the movie since that seems to be very important to her and that several of the Littles are too. This was a very good purchase for us!",1335225600,,2446,4.076763485477178
5022214,5,B006W4KVK2,This keeps my 4 year old watching over and over. She loves these dolls and I can get stuff done around the house while she plays and this is on. Finally a movie that keeps her siting more than 3 min!,1335225600,,199,3.8780487804878048

Unfortunately, I didn't think to record the movie on our DVR, so I bought it. If you have girls that adore Lalaloopsies, then they will adore this movie. My girls grabbed their Lalaloopsy dolls, and acted along with the movie, so that their dollies were also in on the adventure. In a way, the movie helped foster their imaginations as they play with their dolls. Even after the movie ended, my daughters continued Pillow's adventure..lol.",1333411200,8,540,4.75531914893617
