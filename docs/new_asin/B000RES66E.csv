8200095,3,B000RES66E,no instruction booklet at all was supplied  I had trouble figuring out how it was intended to be used.  its took me about 2 months to figure out how to use it,1522713600,,158,3.90625
8200096,5,B000RES66E,"When I first purchased my Lap Steel Guitar, I could barely wait to strum the strings! I had a huge void until I stumbled onto the DVD's on You Tube performed by George Boards! These DVD's by the Master of Lap Steel are so amazing and are in my opinion the absolute best that are affordable! His lessons are displayed by looking over his shoulders while playing! This to me was an advantage as if it gave me the impression I could see both hands and the keyboard at the same time! Observing this method of teaching gives the student an advantage by listening and seeing how the strings are addressed in each lesson! I have yet found any other method for lessons better then these DVD's by George Boards! Very, Very Helpful and the best opportunity for the beginner and intermediate students to learn how to play the Lap Steel Guitar!",1347840000,2,832,4.480263157894737
8200097,4,B000RES66E,"There isn't a lot of instruction on six string c6 tuned lap steel out there, but, fortunatly this series seems to be a good one. I only have the Hank Sr. one, but am planning allready to purchase the rest of George's stuff. This review is only for the Hank Sr. DVD and CD package. The lessons are presented well and get right to the point. Intro's, riffs and simple variations are clearly shown. The lessons are so well done that it's kind of deceptive just how much good information is being passed to the viewer.
Having a CD with backup music (with vocals!) is a real helpful bonus. The backup music is guitar and vocals with NO steel. The only other thing you'll need is a recording of the original Hank songs (But really, who would order this DVD that didn't allready have a Hank cd collection?)
My only complaints would be that a Chord chart for the songs, maybe Tab be added, (there is no printed instruction in this set) though George teaches well enough without. Also I would really like a track added for each song on the CD that has the Steel licks on it in addition to the play-along tracks. (those are just suggestions!)
All in all, an amazingly inexpensive, nicely done piece of work. Thanks!!",1199750400,,1206,4.461538461538462
