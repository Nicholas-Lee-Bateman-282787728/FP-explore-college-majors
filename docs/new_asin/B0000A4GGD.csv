7996199,2,B0000A4GGD,"""Enter the Devil"" reminds me why I hated 1974.  Danila (Stella Carnacina ) is an artist who studies art. She rides in her boyfriend's VW thing without a door, taking home an old statue of a crucified man, about as common as a miracle in Italy. At home she discovers her mother is having an affair with a man who has better Hasselhoff hair than her husband and can make a rose stem sound like a bullwhip. It isn't long before the statue comes to life and rapes Danila (she appeared to not like it for the first 10 seconds anyway). Later instead of a simple rape, our animated statue man crucifies Danila which leads to possession issues, maybe wishing she was raped instead. Special effects include red eye contacts and Alka-Seltzer. Worth a pass.

7996201,1,B0000A4GGD,"The only saving grace is that the mother and daughter [she's an adult] are not bad looking.  It seems that they started shooting before the script was finished.  Somewhere along the way somebody said: ""Script!?  We don't need no stinking script.""  That is where a thin plot turned into this movie.  No real actors or directors were used in the making of this movie.  [Unless the Mother and daughter were actually porn stars- in which case their poor acting might be explained.]  Often, the lighting was poor.  Perhaps the camera person had some skills but the director didn't allow skills in this movie.  If you're reading this- I can almost guarantee you-  that you would be able to play a possessed  person far better.
  Plot:  Girl is supposed to be a genius about art.  She is asked to come look at a ""Christ-like"" , life-size, Crucifix.  It's made from an olive tree and is actually occupied by an evil spirit.  If you feel that department store mannequins are real art work then you'll be impressed.  The mother likes rough sex and cheats on her husband.  [I think it's so they can have some nudity.]  It has nothing to do with the movie.  Anyhow, the possessed mannequin decides that the daughter is the vessel of its/his dreams.  The spirit not takes control of her.  She is sent to a nunnery where she awaits the exorcist: ""Xeno"".  Who is a strange priest that likes to live alone.  Now the exorcist and the evil spirit must battle for her soul.  Maybe to the death.  Remember: I told you this was an awful movie.",1460419200,,1522,4.54074074074074

7996205,4,B0000A4GGD,"I have to disagree with the previous reviews.  If you want a hollywood movie don't purchase a B-movie.  While being a posession movie and ripping off the Excorcist a bit, I found it highly entertaining.  It's everything that the Patricia Arquete movie ""Stigmata"" should have been.  And here I had been expecting total nacho cheese based on the ""title"".
It's cheap to buy and the production values were lower than hollywood standards but it's a hell of a lot better than any of the Exorcist hollywood pre/sequals of late; or anything with Keanu Reeves.",1296777600,,551,4.829787234042553
7996206,1,B0000A4GGD,"Despite the fact that the  cover art rips off one of my favorite movies, the Rocky Horror Picture Show, I decided to watch this one anyway, thinking maybe it would be somewhat entertaining.  Unfortunately, I was very, very  wrong.  This movie is one of the worst ripoffs of The Exorcist I have ever  seen.  Think of the most pathetic Italian or Mexican horror film you have  ever seen (there's probably been many), and you have a vague inkling of the  damage it causes to your brain cells to watch this film.  No scares,  pathetic ""devil worship"" and posession, laughable FX, no gore,  not even unintentional laughs.  If anyone out there has seen this movie and  now wants to kill me because they like it, you must be seeing something I  don't because this movie is outdone in badness only by It's Alive 3: Island  of the Alive, and no, that is not a complement.",952387200,2,862,4.5064935064935066
