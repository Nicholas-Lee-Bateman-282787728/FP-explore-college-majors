2455650,5,B000CCBCIK,"I got this dvd for my daughters, ages 10 and 2, and they both love it.  I had all kinds of HH things when I was little...books, lunchboxes, dolls.  This Holly is the great-granddaughter of the original Holly, and they make reference several times in the dvd to the original Holly.  There is even a song where Holly looks at a picture of her great-grandmother and sings a song about how they would have been friends.

The subject matter is typical little girl stuff...teasing brother, being honest with friends, etc.  The background family stories going on are good too.

It is kind of like Strawberry Shortcake a little bit older.  Both daughters loved this movie and I hope there will be more.  The music is great.  I think it is done by Leann Rimes.

Great dvd!",1141948800,11,763,4.544117647058823

8096892,5,B000CCBCIK,"My almost eight-year-old daughter loves the new Hollie Hobbie stories because she can easily relate to the characters. Hollie is descended from the original Hollie Hobbie (she is her great granddaughter) and in this story, Hollie discovers more about her heritage. She also learns the consequences of deception when she does something to trick her brother Robbie, and makes amends for it.

In this day where children are exposed to characters such as those found in Bratz and Monster High, these Hollie Hobbie stories are a breath of fresh air. The themes of friendship, community, etc. are explored in the various episodes and are done quite well. They don't come across as preachy, but remain fresh and entertaining. My daughter and I also enjoyed Hollie Hobbie: Christmas Wishes.",1357516800,,782,5.109375
8096893,5,B000CCBCIK,"My 3 year old LOVES HOLLY HOBBY!!! And its very hard to find!
Holly has great morals and she teaches to share, and of course be nice to your friends ect. So I don't mind letting my 3 year old watch her over and over!",1278892800,,216,3.8222222222222224

8096896,4,B000CCBCIK,"We saw the Holly Hobbie Christmas special on Nick Jr. in December and my four-year-old enjoyed it so much that I bought her this DVD.  She absolutely loves it and wants to watch it every day.  The story is rather simple - Holly wants to throw a surprise party for her Aunt Jessie.  But there's a cute part that explains that this Holly is the great-granddaughter of the original Holly Hobbie that I remember from my childhood.  There's humor and some good songs...overall a very enjoyable movie, especially for girls in the 4-8 age range.",1169596800,2,538,4.631578947368421
8096897,5,B000CCBCIK,My grandaughter really liked this dvd. She watches it over and over and has even learned all the songs.,1168819200,,103,4.473684210526316
8096898,5,B000CCBCIK,"My 4 year old son has been watching this movie over and over again since last March.  It's cute, it teaches them about respecting their friends and others.  It's got a kind of cute, a little annoying song but nothing too annoying for the parents.  Great little movie.",1165536000,3,267,4.520833333333333
8096899,5,B000CCBCIK,"My almost 5 year old twin daughters love this movie....and the surprise was that I actually liked it too.  The characters are entertaining and likeable.  The story-line is well put together with a lot of life lessons interwoven.  Values such as respect, honesty, loyalty, tolerance and friendship are taught yet don't come off as being preachy.  I just wish the producers would put out more Holly Hobbie movies.",1162512000,3,411,5.0
8096900,5,B000CCBCIK,"Back in the 70's, I was way into Holly Hobbie, so I was pretty excited to see her Great-Granddaughter with the same name (even though she's on the maternal side, if you figure that one out, explain it to me, please) making a come back.  My preschool aged daughters love this movie and have taken to even creating Hay Girls adventures on their own.  Quite frankly it's a nice respite from all the Disney Princesses. Holly is a normal every day girl just like them and that's refreshing in the face of a lot of little girl's entertainment.

The story revolves around Holly's trip from the city to small-town Clover for her Aunt Jessie's birthday party.  Holly and her Clover friends help to plan the party and to play tricks on Holly's younger alien-obsessed brother.  All the characters are enjoyable and interesting.  There are no country hick types here.  Aunt Jessie runs a pie shop and hipster Uncle Dave eats all her pies when not practicing with his band.  Holly sings a couple songs, giving this a modern edge.  The songs are perfect for little girls to sing over an over again (as mine do).  The messages of sisters and friendship...and gluttony too, I guess (Aunt Jessie plays a trick on her pie-crazy husband) are treated as story-line, not preaching.  It's really just wonderful girly entertainment all around.",1142812800,6,1320,4.745614035087719
