2354784,5,B000A2XAUA,"Curb review

This is a great series and as a whole this is a fantastic set of DVDs from HBO. With this set you are getting each of the individual seasons with their original cases. Don't expect this  set to come in any sort of fancy packaging.

The main thing I want to stress with this review is that this is a review of the individual season DVDs and there special features. When a customer is researching complete dvd sets I tend to assume that they already know they love the show so I am hoping to five a bit more than that. ( please let me know if I'm wrong)

Oh, one thing to note there will not be any deleted scenes in this box set. This is less of a box set omission and more of a Larry David thing. He has openly stated that he does not want his material that has been cut out to be released, I guess we just have to accept that.

Anyway, this series is great and if you are getting all of the seasons this way you will have plenty of extras but each individual season seems to be feast or famine.

Season 1

The first season appears in 1.33:1 full frame aspect ratio which may irk some viewers if seeing this today. The quality isn't the best but a lot of that can be attributed to the fact the the production quality of the source material was low.

The sound in Dolby 2.0 and is a pleasure. You mostly get dialogue with this but the bit if music there is sounds nice.

This season features a nice dvd commentary for the episode 'pants tent.' This is a nice commentary and really allows us to hear about the creating of the show in general. You will hear from Cheryl Hines Larry David and Jeff Garlin

There is also an interview by bob costs of Larry David. This is about a half an hour and we get to hear about the process of creating the show from Larry. He basically explains how the heart of the show comes from the script free freedom in each scene. He gives many examples from various seasons

You also get the prototype for the show which is an hbo documentary of sorts where we see Larry David considering his return to standup. We see the main characters from the series and we really get a feel for how this is the start of the series we love. This doesn't shine the way the show does but it's a great start and a fun watch.

This is a good season with a great set of special features.

Season 2

For this season there isn't much to say. You get the episodes and that us about it. No special features seen here. No commentaries. This was an odd move but the first set was so rich it's hard to complain. Well, actually that's not correct. I've been on the Internet a few times and its easy for complaints to flood in. Hopefully the first season and future seasons help soften the blow of a special feature free season 2.

Season 3

More of the same here in relation to picture size. Full screen presentation and 2.0 Dolby sound.

The special feature we get here is a single feature cut into two prices. This is from the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival which has the crew chatting and giving us behind the scenes information. This is really funny but it also highlights how many funny bits we are missing out on. I feel like by season three we should at least have an outtakes reel. A show based on improv really needs this tidbit.

Season 4

Here we again have 1:33 full screen and a nice picture. No major flaws seen in image quality here.

Again, no real special features here unless you count episode previews.

Season 5

So yeah same 1:33 presentstion. The picture quality is about as good as it is going to get for this show. It is not bad by any means but it is good considering the type of show it is.

Here we have a higher quantity of special features but not definitely a higher quality.

The History of Curb So Far"" (29:34) and ""Even Further"" (24:12). Two looks back at how the series started and some things that are going on in the show now. Some of it is interesting but far less so than previous material.

 ""casting tape footage"" sounds very promising but isn't all that exciting. We get to see David and Cheryl hines practicing.

Season 6

Same A/V transfer as before.

Extras include 'A conversation with Larry David and Susie Essman' where Larry David talks about what makes the show special and about what aspects of the show have surprised him.
We also get a fun gag reel. 5 minutes long. In addition to this we get a bit of something 'On the set' where the cast talks about how great the show is

Season 7

Finally this season brings curb into the high definition market. Does it need it? No. Can you see the difference? Yes!

The transfer is 1.78:1 and it is a very nice anamorphic widescreen transfer.

For bonus content here we get a lot of fun material. It is also really nice to see that much of what we have gotten here relates to the fact that this show came back despite it having been thought to be dead in the water.

The Seinfeld Reunion: It Could Only Happen on Curb."" This is a semi promotional conversation with cast and crew about the meeting of these two fantastic series

. ""A Seinfeld Moment on Curb""
Larry David, Jerry Seinfeld, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Michael Richards and Jason Alexander get together to speak a little more about their unlikely reunion.
""Rebuilding the Seinfeld Sets""
We catch a glimpse of the sets in storage and hear about their careful restoration. this is very behind-the-scenes and is a real treat to see

Finally, ""Larry David as George Costanza"" this allows David a bit of time to chat about the pros and cons of having an alter ego on-screen.

All of the extras here are centered around Seinfeld and I couldn't be happier.

Season 8

1.78:1 aspect ratio which is the original size and is formed to fit 16:9. You may be pleased to hear that all of the special features have English French and Spanish subtitles.

After all of the fun we had with the features on season seven season right has brought us back to a limited special feature world.

The only special features we see here are ""Leon's guide to ny city"" abd a roundtable discussion. The first is alright but doesn't really have the same feel as some of the other things that we have seen in the past. I didn't feel that it added enough but I guess any content should be appreciated.

The second thing that we get here is a 90 minute roundtable discussion. This is very entertaining and definitely feels like something you would get on a complete series box set.

So there are all if the special features. The number and quality of features has gone up and down but overall it is a complete package with hours of entertainment.",1379376000,9,6565,4.316218418907906

8073604,5,B000A2XAUA,I love Curb Your Enthusiasm  because it has the quirkiness associated with the Seinfeld series and the George as well as Jerry characters.  I never got to watch all of the episodes but I watched a great number of CYE episodes. When I had the opportunity  to purchase the entire series I did.  I just love Larry David and he reminds me of one of my beloved relatives who is very difficult to get along with.,1409097600,2,406,4.302631578947368
