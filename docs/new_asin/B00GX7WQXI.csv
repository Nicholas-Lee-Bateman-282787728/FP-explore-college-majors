6123256,4,B00GX7WQXI,"not the greatest movie made, seen worst  but don't  know when, seen better just this afternoon, very low budget movie,price should be 1/2 what it is.",1400544000,,149,4.6923076923076925
6123257,5,B00GX7WQXI,"A great buy and even better movie.
This movie was action packed, suspenseful and could quite possibly be feasible.
Buy it, watch it.. You won't regret it.",1399680000,,154,4.7407407407407405
6123258,2,B00GX7WQXI,I paused the movie and from that point could not get back to the movie.  I could not get any assistance which was unusual .  So it was a total loss.,1398988800,,148,3.7419354838709675
6123259,1,B00GX7WQXI,"The concept sounds really cool, but the delivery is subpar at best.  The acting is completely rushed and unrealistic.  The plot is fairly basic, and there were so many missed opportunities for character development needed to pull the viewer in.  The ending was ridiculous!  Seemed like they ran out of money and just had someone take pictures with their camera phone.  Many of the action sequences were needless and repetitive.  I wish I could get my money back.",1397952000,3,462,4.858974358974359
6123260,5,B00GX7WQXI,Spellbinding.  I've watched it three times in the last month.  I'm going to watch it again later tonight. I pick up something new with each viewing.,1393804800,,148,4.653846153846154
6123261,5,B00GX7WQXI,"I think this is one of the best zombie films I have seen lately. Its full of action, blood good old time real effects. Its worth the money. I really enjoyed it.",1392768000,,160,4.03125
6123262,4,B00GX7WQXI,"The opening of this film showed much promise with lots of action and pretty good effects, but after about 20 min it slows down and becomes just another average zombie movie.  Nice little twist at the ending that I was glad to see angered some of the people I was watching this with but I thought was great. This film probably won't be winning any oscars but it isn't a low budget camcorder film either, I found a copy for under $10 and feel that it was worth it due to the first 15 min of the film, just wish the momentum would have kept up throughout the whole film.  Worth a watch if you are a zombie movie fan.",1392249600,3,613,4.1
6123263,2,B00GX7WQXI,"The first 15 minutes of the film explains that Stalin had developed a gas to create a race of super warriors at Stalingrad. A canister turns up 80 years later in Bulgaria. John (Paul Logan) is sent to investigate and question Dr. Bennett (Manal El-Feitury) who filed the report on an infected patient who got injured in an old warehouse. Logan wants to visit the warehouse. The Bulgarian colonel runs a black market arms deal and doesn't want John snooping around. As an explosion occurs the gas is released creating super warriors or berserk zombies running around killing people. Dr, Bennett's daughter becomes separated from her and the other half of the film is spent looking for her.

There were no special zombie make-up other than blood  and guts and it was hard to tell how effective they were as much of the shooting was done at night while jerking the camera around for effect, i.e. if it isn't scary. jerk the camera around and have people scream...someone will think it is great.

In addition to the effects being low grade, the writers forgot about scripting characters relying on the zombie craze and a name to carry the film.

Lower end rental at best.

Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex. Brief stripper nudity?",1390608000,3,1224,4.754716981132075
8628263,4,B00GX7WQXI,"Really enjoyed this zombie flick. I am a fan of the genre but it seems I have to watch four losers for every one that is actually good. This one goes in my rather small pile of zombie flicks I intend to actually watch again. The dead in this movie are more like the dead in ""Twenty eight days later"", which is fine as they better fit the plot line.",1524441600,,348,3.9857142857142858
8628264,2,B00GX7WQXI,"Okay film , does a rehash of past zombie films, and does it not all that hot.! I actually had to stay awake at the end. Felt I need as refund on my prime account!!",1504224000,,163,3.6857142857142855
8628265,4,B00GX7WQXI,"The plot is OK , some of the acting is well done . I did not like the ending .",1469232000,,78,2.95
8628266,3,B00GX7WQXI,The film was alright. Nothing special to write home about. The ending is just phoned in and is just terrible. They also rely on way too many cliches for the plot. The effects aren't that bad. The sets are cool and look decent. The scenes set during WWII look really good for low budget. Give it a go for a couple of bucks.,1440892800,,322,4.126984126984127
8628267,4,B00GX7WQXI,This was actually a very good zombie action flick.,1434240000,,50,4.666666666666667
8628268,3,B00GX7WQXI,"A semi realistic look at Bulgarian life with an infusion of Nerve gas zombies.
Interesting, not great.",1413504000,,102,5.0588235294117645

8628270,4,B00GX7WQXI,"A good zombie flick! I enjoyed it. Has a good plot lot's of blood, guts and undead zombies. Sit down relax open a beer and escape everyday life with the walking dead. I mean they're just like you only dead. Enjoy",1411084800,,212,4.195121951219512
8628271,3,B00GX7WQXI,"Nowadays there is 3 types of zombie movies, the comedy, the horror and the action type of zombie movie. This most definetly belongs in the action category of zombie movie. It's not horribly bad and not horribly good either, not much of a character build-up as we are thrown into the action pretty much str8 away.

There's some gore and violence in here but it's more of a action movie sorta violence whit machine guns and explosions than splatter scenes. If u catch it on late night cable or find it used for a few dollars it's not a bad purchase but it's hardly essential viewing or anything you buy full price.",1404691200,,612,4.464285714285714
8628272,3,B00GX7WQXI,"The opening scene of this movie ranks right up there with great war movies like Saving Private Ryan.
In this case find a young German soldier fighting in one of the bloodiest battles of World War Two, the battle for Stalingrad where German and Soviet soldiers battled each other building to building and street to street.
The scene is very realistic and intense and just when it looks like the German soldier is about to die after the Soviets overrun German positions and he is alone they suddenly and hastily withdraw.
The young German soldier soon finds out why ... The Soviets have developed a new weapon, gas that bring the dead back to life.
The young German soldier survives after putting on his gas mask and escapes only to end up in an insane asylum after what he has witnessed drives him mad.
Fast forward present day American intelligence finds the soldiers diary and want to find the left over gas canisters located in Bulgaria.
The head of the operation is a veteran army ranger and here is where the show takes a turn for the worse.
They have a Scottish actor play the army ranger which is fine except he speaks with a heavy Scottish accent !
From there we have other actors/actresses who deliver their lines poorly which is why I gave it only three out of five stars.
My advice : Rent it before you buy it to make sure you like it before wasting your hard earned money.",1403913600,,1383,4.470355731225297
