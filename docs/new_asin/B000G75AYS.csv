2601972,5,B000G75AYS,IF YOU WERE A CHILD IN THE 70'S OR EVEN IF YOU WEREN'T  SINBAD IS A GREAT COMEDIAN FIT FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY TO WATCH....SO SO FUNNY AND NO BAD LANGUAGE....I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS CD TO EVERYONE TO WATCH,1169251200,2,207,4.175
2601973,4,B000G75AYS,The DVD is spectacular.  Sinbad is absolutely hilarious....not to mention not one cuss word to be found.  The DVD is family friendly and best veiwed with a son or daughter.  I will admit I was a little dismayed in the DVD being advertised at 82 miniutes (the same as the VHS version) but in actuality is only approximately 60 minutes.  Believe me....those extra 21 minutes are well worth it!!!!  Overall....a pleasant and pleasing addition to anyones comedy collection!,1168473600,8,469,4.961538461538462
2601974,5,B000G75AYS,"I love Sinbad. He is one of the rare comedians who can make you laugh until you cry without using any foul language. If you grew up in the 70s, you will absolutely love this DVD. It is all about what it was like in what we wore, the music we listened to, the hilarity of the technology -8 track tapes and dealing with your parents. You will see yourself in this regardless of whether you grew up rich or poor and it applies to all ethnic origins. It's one of my favorites. I wish HBO would put out the one Sinbad did at Atlanta at Morehouse College. That is the best performance about growing up and all the dumb kid things you did, how your parents had the rules about being home before the street lights came on in the summer. It brings back a lot of memories you hadn't thought of in awhile and it is absolutely hilarious. Sinbad's parents were in the audience and it kept showing them as he told (most likely exaggerated) stories about them. They were laughing and shaking their heads. It made it even better with them there. HBO - you need to release that special you did at Morehouse College too. This will definitely make you laugh!",1168473600,,1139,4.3023255813953485
2601975,5,B000G75AYS,It's really nice to sit down & watch a comedy act and not have to worry about language concerns! Sinbad is hilariously entertaining!,1168300800,,132,4.782608695652174
2601976,4,B000G75AYS,"This is a GREAT performance but I also own the VHS tape and for some reason there are at least 2 missing segments from the DVD performance that were on the VHS version, very disappointing since those segments were equally as funny as the rest of this DVD.",1160352000,5,255,4.333333333333333
2601977,5,B000G75AYS,"My wife and I first saw 'Afros and Bellbottoms' a few years ago and we laughed so hard we could hardly breathe.  If you are smart enough to purchase this DVD, do keep something soft by your chair, because you will most certainly fall onto the floor.

Sinbad's stories of his childhood in the 70's and 80's will especially entertain those who also grew up in those years, but his style of comedy will ultimately entertain everyone who watches.  I particularly love how he is able to make fun of himself while making fun of others.  Absolutely everyone should purchase this DVD and noone will be disappointed.  This DVD will come to be one that you quote on a daily basis just as my wife and I do.",1156118400,21,695,4.3984375

2601979,1,B000G75AYS,This was AWFUL. DON'T waste your money. This is so poorly taped. You only see Sinbad from the knees up. Someone filmed this from a table and is making money off a poorly made tape. I wish someone had of told me on a review how horrible and BAD this is. I think Sinbad is hilarious and threw this away.,1454976000,,301,4.033333333333333
2601980,5,B000G75AYS,This was a really funny stand up comedy.  Sinbad is really good.  He really keeps it clean.....I like the fact that the whole family can enjoy clean entertainment without all the bad words.  The kids can stay in the room for this one.....,1443657600,2,238,4.488372093023256

2601989,5,B000G75AYS,You can't stop laughing. Sinbad takes you back to his youth during the 60's and 70's.  It's a rare comedian who can make you laugh without resorting to profanity! Only a few comedians can do that and Sinbad is one of them.,1416787200,,222,4.285714285714286
2601990,5,B000G75AYS,You can't get any cleaner or funnier. A must have. Many of the jokes will be lost on the new school. This is definitely old school humor.,1413936000,,137,4.111111111111111

2601994,5,B000G75AYS,"It's been a while since I've had this one but it arrived in a shorter time than I expected.  It was in good condition and the quality was great. It's very funny as I thought it would be. It had me crack'n up. The sound and viewing was great.  I love Sinbad good clean, good quality comedy.

I haven't rec'd The Greatest Manifestation yet, it's still on its way.  I think I just ordered it either this past Monday or just last week so it still has time to get here.",1400803200,,464,4.065934065934066
2601995,5,B000G75AYS,"This is absolutely one of my family's all time faves. He is so funny ... and in a ""clean"" way, too ... one that won't be offensive in an ""adult"" kind of way. He was mentored by Bill Cosby ... and he's been another one of our faves. This video had us laughing so hard that we were crying ... and it almost triggered an ""asthmatic fit"" with our daughter. Keep 'em coming, Sinbad.",1397779200,,377,4.108108108108108
2601996,5,B000G75AYS,"I had been looking for this dvd for a long time before it became available. I may be white and from a small town but this material resonated with me big time! I could, and have, quoted from this all day. I'd almost forgotten about lay-aways, school clothes versus play clothes, and that slimy candy necklace! So hilarious.",1393804800,,322,4.568965517241379
2601997,4,B000G75AYS,"It got here really quickly. It is an older DVD so the quality isn't great, but that isn't the Sellers fault. And it is to be expected not to be great quality! But all in all was pleased.",1389830400,,186,3.9210526315789473

2602000,5,B000G75AYS,Sinbad is one of my favorite comedians. He is hysterical and he doesn't need to swear for it to be funny. He is so unique for that reason. A lot of other comedians should figure that out it would be so much nicer for all audiences.,1381622400,,231,4.043478260869565
2602001,5,B000G75AYS,"I loved this tape.  If you remember the bell bottoms and Afros from the '70's

AWESOME comedy video!",1362700800,,354,4.071428571428571

2602014,5,B000G75AYS,"Sinbad is absolutely hysterically funny without being foul or vulgar.  Not one swear word or inappropriate innuendo, totally family friendly, but so darned FUNNY that this left me in stitches.  Excellent video to show at a party, family get together or just with friends hanging out.  Every DVD of his has hilarious insights into parenting, being a teenager and male-female relations, but with not one repeat of material.  This guy sees into the humor of the dymamics with a fresh perspective every time and leaves you saying, ""Yep, I've done that!"" while rolling on the floor cracking up.  A must purchase if you like to laugh!!!",1355011200,,630,4.90566037735849
2602015,5,B000G75AYS,Sinbad is one funny dude. I came up in the 70's and he had me in stitches with this one. Don't matter if you're black or white he will have you rolling!,1353888000,,152,3.78125
2602016,5,B000G75AYS,Sinbad is always enjoyable to watch.  He has nice clean humor that the whole family can enjoy.  I would recommend this to any Sinbad fan.,1338768000,,137,4.44
2602017,5,B000G75AYS,I had seen this video many many years ago and I thought it was absolutely the funniest Sinbad ever!  It was out of print for quite awhile and I couldn't get it.  Finally I was able to find it at Amazon.  Thank you so very much!  My family and I will watch this over and over again.  You have to be in your 40's though because many of the things he's relating to are things like beepers and 8 track players.  Other things are just teenagers in general.  Absolutely wonderful!,1327449600,,474,4.2
2602018,5,B000G75AYS,"We have watched this DVD over and over again. This was especially helpful when our son was a teenager, it kept us laughing. Sinbad delivers wisdom and wit like no one else.",1319846400,,172,4.40625
2602019,5,B000G75AYS,"Sinbad is very funny.  I especially like the joke about his mother, the layaway queen & the joke about kids not wanting to go outside.  This DVD is well worth the money.  Enjoy!",1308700800,,177,4.303030303030303

2602021,5,B000G75AYS,This Sinbad comedy is hilarious! Took it on a girls weekend trip and we laughed til our stomach's hurt. Takes you back to the 70's and 80's. The good ol day's! Gotta see to appreciate!,1296691200,,184,4.285714285714286
2602022,5,B000G75AYS,"Sinbad, as always, never lets me down. He's a great comedienne who does not need to use vulgarity or any kind of improper language to be funny. He is a delight to watch and I was so glad to find several DVDs with him. I bought this one as a gift and as usual, it was a big hit. THANKS for having this great DVD available! Highly recommend if you want to laugh!!!",1294185600,,362,3.9726027397260273
2602023,5,B000G75AYS,"What a talented man.  This was just as funny as I remembered it to be.  I've already watched it twice since receiving it.  Sinbad is a treasure and one of my favorite all-time comedians.  Keep it coming, Sinbad!",1294099200,,211,4.473684210526316
2602024,4,B000G75AYS,"I heard that Sinbad had a new DVD special out recently, called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sinbad-Where-U-Been/dp/B002ZTLVZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sinbad: Where U Been?</a>. It was WAY better than I expected, and it had my friends and I rolling with laughter. After that 5-star set, I was compelled to check out some of his older stuff. Again, I was very surprised. This DVD was much better than I had ever recalled Sinbad being, back in the early 90's, when he was big. Maybe I just didn't ""get him"" back then or maybe his stuff was just too heavily edited for TV, which is very possible. Either way, this special brings us back to Sinbad's childhood, reminding us how things were, and I found it very relevant even though I am much younger than he is. It had tons of really good laughs, and he does it clean! I don't care one way or another if a comic curses or not, but it was pretty impressive that he was this good without needing to shock the audience. I was continuously blown away by his sharp observations of the world around him. In my opinion, that is exactly the mark of a top-notch comedian.

I will certainly keep an eye out for more of his material!",1275696000,,1216,4.846153846153846
2602025,4,B000G75AYS,My wife watched this when it was out and she had been wanting to see it again so we found it on here and ordered it. This brought back memories for her and me never seeing this before I thought it was great. I thought it was a little short and wished that it had something special on it besides the show but there was nothing there nor did I expect it.,1272672000,,352,3.9027777777777777

2602028,4,B000G75AYS,"I was very excited to get this DVD.  I have the VHS tape and my player died.  The clarity is great and as usual Sinbad is hilarious.  The only drawback is the editing.  Some of the funniest parts were cut.  A suggestion to the companies in the future, please put everything on the DVD, that is what the consumer is paying for.",1260835200,2,326,4.193548387096774
2602029,5,B000G75AYS,I got this as a Christmas gift for my son. We were talking about seeing his HBO specials when my son was younger. Sinbad certainly has a way with situations! VERY funny without raunchiness! We enjoyed it as a family!,1259625600,,216,4.425

2602032,5,B000G75AYS,"This stand up is great and one of my fav's. You had have to live back in the day or grew up with a poor middle class family to understand the jokes, my family had a lot of laughs worth the purchase for any sinbad fan.",1248480000,,217,3.739130434782609

I highly recommend this presentation to anyone who grew up in the 70's. It was an instant flashback in time. Hilarious and truthful at the same time.",1235692800,,318,4.229508196721311

2602037,5,B000G75AYS,I saw this show years ago and it was awesome. I search the tv for it and watch it every time it's on. I was so thrilled to find it. Sinbad has to be the funniest comedian ever and he's clean about it too. Finally a program that everyone will love and is safe for you to watch with your parents and your children at the same time. I find myself laughing so hard I cry. I relate to so many of his stories! I can't even pick a favorite part because they are all my favorites! Buy this for yourself. You won't be sorry.

I'm happy to see this is now available on DVD.  I'm very disappointed that some of the funniest portions have been edited out!  Since receiving this DVD I've been searching for the VHS version that I'm told contains the full uneditied program.  Does anyone know where the VHS version can be purchased?
It's great having a stand-up comedian that's so funny and entertaining without the use of profanity.  Keep up the good work Sinbad!",1221696000,,570,4.76530612244898

We watched it the night we recieved the movie in the mail.  Laughed all night.  My husband has even watched a couple more times since that night.  Its a good buy.",1209686400,,322,3.953125
2602040,5,B000G75AYS,"I found it very difficult, if not impossible for me to grasp conceptually, that a stand-up comedian could be laugh out riot funny without being profane and lascivious.

Ok, there are a few exceptions, but this is more street funny, at the same time being clean. It showcases the true talent of Sinbad here, in that most stand-ups utilize profanity as a silly crutch for their acts to gain favor with the audience, but this man and his act is so different. It represents a mature comedy routine, and not like the way, Pryor, Murphy, the kings or Carlin would or for that matter could do.

This DVD is in my collection and is a great ""picker upper"", when i have one of those days.
Please do check it out if not already done so.",1205971200,,725,4.362962962962963

2602042,5,B000G75AYS,"Sinbad is probably the most looked over comedians because he get's overshadowed by the Pirate, but on the stage with a Mic he could make the toughest swashbuckler cry from laughter. This is definitely worth purchasing if you like a good stand up. He touches on his youth and things he encountered growing up you might be able to relate to... go ahead and check it out.",1202515200,,368,4.507462686567164

2602045,5,B000G75AYS,"This DVD is Sinbad at this finest.

Sinbad's act is simply belly-aching, laugh out loud fun.

His 70's flashbacks, whoopings, staying out late and sugar rush bits had me crying beecause I laughed so hard.

Highly recommended if you want to see a great stand up act.",1191456000,,265,4.595744680851064
2602046,5,B000G75AYS,This dvd is soooo funny. I am still laughing at his act two days later. He has got to be the cleanest stand up comedian there is. I hope there will be more of him in the future!,1188518400,,177,3.6842105263157894
2602047,5,B000G75AYS,He is the best comedian ever.  We have watched this over and over and laugh every time.,1181260800,2,87,4.117647058823529
2602048,5,B000G75AYS,"The thing I love about Sinbad is that he can make you laugh so hard your side hurts, but he never swears. To me, that is the sign of a great comedian. This is a great DVD. He brings back memories of the 70's on this one. But his humor is so universal, that all ages can relate, and enjoy his performance.",1178409600,2,304,3.9193548387096775
2602049,3,B000G75AYS,"I own the original VHS tape.  This DVD was edited, and alot of key parts were missing.  I would not have bought this DVD, if I knew portions had been cut out.",1176163200,31,158,3.90625
2602050,5,B000G75AYS,"I rented this one sometime ago to ""introduce"" his comedy routine to my teenage kids (I had seen this one before along with one HBO special he did in Denver -- oh my goodness that was a hoot too -- unfortunately, I can't find it though!!).  At first, they didn't think they'd enjoy it.  After the first 10 mins., my kids were rolling on the floor.  Even though they're not 70s kids, they found Sinbad's wild recitations and expressions hilarious.  We've seen our copy over and over again -- it never gets old!!  All my 15-year-old son has to do to get me to laugh is to do Sinbad's impression of the stair-master ... I won't give it away, but it gets us going every time!!  His comedy is good, clean fun!! Too much violence and curse words in our kids' lives everywhere they turn.  We need more Sinbad in this world!!",1176076800,26,816,4.328947368421052
2602051,3,B000G75AYS,"I had an original HBO VHS of this stand up and it was awesome, but I lost it somehow so I wanted to buy another one. The only complaint I have is the fact that this DVD is edited. Certain subjects that Sinbad talked about in the original copy he doesn't even bring up in this one. I checked to see if maybe it was another city or another night of his stand up, but it was all the same people from the original one. So I guess I am about 90% satisfied with this purchase. Great quality though, I will buy from Amazon again.",1175731200,16,522,3.980952380952381
2602052,5,B000G75AYS,"HILARIOUS! I LOVE SINBAD!

If you like Sinbad, then your sides will be aching after you watch this one. It freakin' rules.

He's got a clean sense of humor. Great laugh.",1175472000,2,169,4.419354838709677
2602053,4,B000G75AYS,"I love Sinbad's comedy.  This DVD was very good, but somehow didn't have some of his funniest stuff that I can remember from a few years ago.  He is so upbeat and funny and I enjoy his style no matter what.  Enjoyable show and DVD.",1174435200,,231,4.088888888888889
2602054,4,B000G75AYS,I laughed so hard at some points I thought I was going to pee my pants. Sinbad really has a handle on society and it's issues. The references to Rodney King are a little dated but the stuff he does about the difference between growing up in the 70's and growing up in the 90's was hilarious!!! I have already watched this a least 3 times and it still is funny!!!,1172102400,6,362,4.112676056338028
2602055,2,B000G75AYS,This was not the entire version of the HBO Special.  I was disappointed because some of my favorite parts were missing from this DVD.  If I had known it wasn't the entire show I wouldn't have bought it.,1170892800,20,202,4.2894736842105265
2602056,5,B000G75AYS,"Sinbad remains our Family's Favorite Funnyman. We howled at the HBO special he did in Atlanta. Howled just as much with this one. We watched it 2 days in a row. What a master at taking regular life experiences and transforming them into comedy that gives you permission to laugh at yourself and so much of what is funny in the world around. I so appreciate Sinbad's ability to be hilarious without resorting to vulgarity. When a father can watch a video with wife and teenage kids and they can still be talking about the video days, weeks, later...and reciting punch lines verbatim..., when 2 distinct generations can laugh to tears at the same material, when there is nothing off color, abusive, immoral, but clean, appealing and side splitting funny...well that's what I call ENTERTAINMENT!

This DVD should be in your library.",1170633600,,829,4.838028169014085
2602057,5,B000G75AYS,"My husband and two teenaged sons sat down to watch this on Saturday.  Within 5 minutes of the start of the show we were in tears!  This man is funny!  I laughed so hard a couple times, I couldn't breathe.  Any adult raised in the 70's will clearly relate and enjoy Sinbad's show....then again, my teenagers loved it too so, it's audience appeal is limitless!

Buy this, watch it...you will love it!",1170028800,6,398,4.472222222222222
