this film. But lovers of true cult should have their heads examined
for not having this film in thier collection. Ground breaking in so
many ways.  This film not only predicted the feminist movement by a
mile it also plays on the communist themed witch-hunt if you really
want to read into it.  Dispite it's title, Joan Crawford plays lead
it this stagebrush saga of two desparate women trying to hold on to
the only man who meant something in their lives. And what a cast of
stars! Sterling Hayden as Johnny, Ward Bond, Ernest Borgnine, Scott
Brady and of course Mercedes McCambridge as the ""other woman"" and I must say Technicolor never looked better in a western,I counted
at least six shades of red in Crawford's lipstick alone. I'm not

660338,5,6303391931,"Bizarre Western directed by the great Nicholas Ray and starring Joan Crawford as Vienna,  a tough saloon/casino owner. Vienna is waiting for a railroad to come through to make her business boom but Emma Small (Mercedes McCambridge) wants her dead. Emma hates Vienna supposedly because The Dancin' Kid (Scott Brady) likes Vienna instead of her. Vienna hires Johnny Guitar (Sterling Hayden) to play guitar in the saloon. They are old lovers from Vienna's dance-hall girl days. But all hell breaks loose when a bank robbery goes wrong and Emma implicates Vienna as the leader and leads a posse to lynch her. Vienna is rescued and takes refuge in the Dancin' Kid's hideout. Emma and Vienna will face off before it's over. Incredible tale written by Philip Yordan and laden with symbolism that has caused some to compare this film to the McCarthy witch hunts of the 50's. It's a fascinating piece all right. It's in color and features a great supporting cast with Ernest Borgnine, Ward Bond and John Carradine. McCambridge is pure hellfire as the self-righteous Emma and Crawford is noble and stoic as Vienna and supposedly did her own stunts. Allegedly, Crawford and McCambridge despised each other on the set and this information kind've adds to the fun of the film. Peggy Lee sings the haunting title ballad. A must see. Watch for it.",1068249600,15,1332,4.893805309734513
660339,4,6303391931,"An unconventional take on the conventional Western genre.
On the surface you have title character ""Johnny Guitar""---onetime ace gunfighter, now laconic loner and wanderer who has renounced his violent past and refuses to wear his guns. He looks up an old saloon-girl love (Joan Crawford as ""Vienna"") only to discover a town in turmoil---both his gal and the General Good need defending...
You might think you see what's coming: Johnny, after agonized moral deliberation, straps on his guns again and rights the prevalent wrongs, possibly with the help of his lady-friend, who's ambivalent about his violent past... A la ""High Noon"", et al.
But NO... Which is what makes this movie such an interesting, important milestone in the Western genre. Johnny G's role in the proceedings is almost immediately negligible; he hangs around the saloon and watches his past amour Vienna first boss around her employees, then confront the angry lynch-mob that stomps in, then placate the bunch of alleged outlaws who drunkenly seek refuge from a sandstorm and proceed to tussle with the already-assembled law folk... Vienna vanquishes all foes, with Johnny making smart remarks, but doing little else, throughout. Even after the law leaves and Johnny brawls with a gang-member, all of his action is off-camera---while we see Vienna parry verbally with one outlaw inside the saloon, we hear the sounds of scuffling outside, then witness the defeated bad guy come stumbling through the swinging doors. (Now WHEN has a Western EVER deprived us of a good old-fashioned street-brawl?? Aside from gunfights, that's the next best excuse for action.)
Johnny and Vienna DO kiss and make up, of course. But on the morning after, even though Vienna IS wearing a dress rather than the slacks we first saw her in, the two immediately head to the town bank, where Vienna again plays an active role in the goings-on while Johnny waits passively outside... He eventually does strap on the guns again, but it's certainly a minor plot point by that time: The final obligatory shoot-out has nothing at all to do with him.
Joan Crawford seems absolutely WIRED in her performance here, especially in the first half of the film, before the more conventional chasing/lynch-mob stuff starts. The early scenes in the saloon are especially fascinating and tension-filled because of Crawford's weirdly quivering intensity. She later regretted taking the role (""I should have had my head examined""), but time has proven her wrong---both she and the film are truly worthy of the cult status they've achieved.",1066608000,8,2565,5.138755980861244
660340,5,6303391931,"Like most of Joan's movies, I've seen this about 5-10 times. Her '50s movies were wild and over-the-top (Torch Song, Queen Bee, etc.) but that's why they are so great and entertaining. Johnny Guitar typifies Joan's far-out '50s technicolor period. Like always, she's tough with a tender side. Always captivating to watch.  The best reason to buy this movie is because it is such a grand, glossy, big-budget western melodrama weeper spectacle. In color, too (you can see close-ups of Joan's beautiful blue eyes). It's really something else, and the haunting Victor Young score you will not soon forget. Peggy Lee sings Johnny Guitar while Sterling Hayden and Joan disappear in the sunset. Joan was a legend and this film was really the end of her queen of the box office status. After the success of Sudden Fear, both Torch Song and Johnny Guitar flopped (two films I think she really put her heart in). The films are classics today but Joan was just thrown aside for a couple years before her Columbia contract (her box office status never really recovered).",1050710400,2,1058,4.845303867403315

660342,4,6303391931,"In old Arizona, the proprietress of a gambling saloon stakes a claim to valuable land and incurs the enmity of a lady banker.  To movie fans, this film is probably most remembered as the western starring two women. In Crawford's post MILDRED PIERCE ""evil older woman"" period, she plays Vienna, depravity incarnate, who is always dressed in black & will do most anything to hold on to her saloon.  Mercedes McCambridge, as Emma Small, plays the woman who wants to take away Vienna's saloon: this seemed a primer for the latter's  foray in ""desperate women"" roles.  Many label this movie as offbeat and baroque, although it isn't excessively violent: rather it's chock-full of Freudian overtones. It's impossible to capture the odd beauty of this complex genre film in a quick essay because it is truly a one-of-a-kind original.
JOHNNY GUITAR certainly represents one of the most important Hollywood westerns, recognised at the time of its initial release by critics throughout Europe.",1033430400,3,983,5.086956521739131
660343,4,6303391931,"Sometimes you wonder what made folks fund a movie at a certain point in time, and I kinda wonder that about they who funded ""Johnny Guitar"". Joan Crawford stars as Vienna, a former dancehall girl who has scraped together enough to build a casino in the middle of nowhere, where a lot of impotent gunslinger/cowboys hang out, while she occasionally plays a grand pi-an-er. What we find out is that she's banking on this ""nowhere"" eventually being right where the new railroad tracks will run, and then she'll make a bundle. Enter the mysterious laconic stranger, Johnny Guitar. What we find out is that he's no stranger to Joan, at least. Now there's been a bank robbery, and Mercedes McCambridge who owns the bank is very angry that her brother banker has been killed. She wants justice from Joan of all people, whom she hates because the men are all more interested in Joan's blue-jeaned bod than hers, in her Little House on the Prairie get-up. Gun fights, lynchings, you name, it takes place before the dramatic showdown between Joan and Mercedes.
""Johnny Guitar"" is weird because the storyline first of all is so odd; because the men are all without power; because Joan shouldn't have been in something like this really; and because it is crypto-lesbian. I mean, what is going ON here? With the right group of people, you'll have a good time. With the wrong group, you'll be thought strange for having suggested it.",1019779200,3,1419,4.748987854251012
660344,5,6303391931,"What a movie. The emotions, tensions, and prejudices are all writ large, so there's no need to go digging for subtleties here. Body language, dialogue, color, and set design all clamor for our attention. It's a very noisy, violent movie from that point of view. Extremely stylized.
The sexual tension is not just between Crawford and Hayden, but between Crawford and McCambridge as well (surprising for a movie of its time). McCambridge's Emma has that hate that clearly comes from denied lust; Crawford's Vienna has just enough disdain to suggest she's not quite indifferent, but since Johnny's in town, there'll be none of That.
Also note that these two women hold all the power in town, while the men wander around being outlaws and ex-gunslingers and patsies, all the while talking about how important they are. Who's kidding whom? Crawford is the entrepreneur with her eye on the future and the railroad coming through; McCambridge is the conservative banker determined to shut Crawford down and keep the town (and the men) to herself.
Watch it once. That's probably all the average viewer will need.",987724800,5,1105,5.010869565217392

Not a moment goes by without some assault on the senses through either the camp, stilted dialogue, or the sheer absurdity of the wardrobe.  No one but Joan Crawford, absolutely NO ONE, could have done this as brilliantly (and as badly) while still making it absurdly entertaining.  The mind-bending thing about this film is trying to imagine who, even in the 1950's, could have sat in a theater taking it seriously.  It's impossible not to imagine an audience roaring with laughter at many of the scenes.  It's like some bizarre, feminist, noir version of ""Blazing Saddles"".

660447,5,6303391931,"This review is for the Olive Signature release. To spell it out up front this Ray's JOHNNY GUITAR (JG) is a cinematic masterpiece. Please consider the films that were nominated for Oscars in 1954:FROM HERE TO ETERNITY, JULIUS CAESAR,THE ROBE,ROMAN HOLIDAY,SHANE. The first won it. The Robe is an embarrassment. Julius Caesar hamfisted classical theatre. Roman Holiday is cinematic powder puff. FHTEternity not too bad, and Shane is bearable in a sentimental Walt Disney kind of fashion. JG was not even nominated. Nor was Ray not even for set decoration. Alfred Hitchcock made the point more than once that cinema is feeling - how well the director is able to marshall images and sound and editing to maximise feelings will determine how powerful an experience the film is. Nicholas Ray, whether by accident or not - you can read about the saga of its production in the accompanying booklet to the Olive edition - is irrelevant. Ray's stamp is all over the film. The acting is pitch perfect; the story relentless in its movement to climax; the dialogue is witty, crisp and exhilarating; the action from the first minute never lets up; the philosophical allusions gripping; the Freudian sub-text interesting; the men are real men; the women real women; the mob is an animal; it is an operatic film in the best sense with a moody and pointed music score with extreme emotions expressed by the main characters especially Borgnine, Crawford, McCambridge. Added to this is the most beautiful and rich colour palette - the lips of Ms Crawford have never seemed so scarlet in their vividness, the mountain earth so red, the trees so verdant. Indeed the film looks and sounds so fresh it could have been made last week. Plus it has sub titles.",1482883200,8,1735,4.864864864864865

660510,4,6303391931,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

While this movie might seem like a standard western in the sense that it has cowboys and outlaws it is as far removed from the standard as possible while still fitting into the genre. Depending on your outlook the movie can be seen as several things. For those who find sexual tension in situations it can be their film. Others will view it as the western it advertises itself to be. And yet some will see it as an allegorical tale of the Communist scare in films at the time. The truth is it fits neatly into all of these categories.

The story revolves around two women in a town on the verge of growing in the Wild West. Vienna (Joan Crawford) is the headstrong owner of the local saloon/gambling hall. She sees the future that is coming in the form of a railroad making its way to the town and is preparing for it. Emma (Mercedes McCambridge) wants the town to remain the cattle land that it was. These two strong female characters are at odds with one another and it eventually boils over.

Add to the mix is the fact that Emma is in love with the Dancin Kid (Scott Brady), a tough guy wannabe who has taken an interest in Vienna. Emmas jealousy is as much a motivation for her hatred of all things Vienna as the possibility of the town growing. Her sexual repression in the form of the Kids refusal of her affection becomes a motivating factor as the film progresses.

Into the mix enter Johnny Guitar (Sterling Hayden). Supposedly hired to be an entertainer for the saloon the reality is that he and Vienna have a past. Guitar is in actuality a famed gunslinger who was in prison while Vienna was making her stand in this town. Their relationship is one that blows hot and cold throughout this film. Whether or not they will end up together isn't seen until the end of the film.

As tempers flare and battle lines are drawn accusations run rampant. When Emmas brother is killed and the stage held up she blames Vienna and the Dancin Kid and his gang. With the help of another landowner named McIvers (Ward Bond) they give Vienna, the Kid and his gang 24 hours to leave town against the protests of the local sheriff. But Vienna is innocent and determined to stand her ground.

The Kid and his gang, on the other hand, decide to take them up on their offer. With their silver mine played out, a mine none of the landowners believed existed, they decide to rob the bank (which is owned by Emma) and head out. Before the robbery Vienna is taking her money out of the bank before Emma can take it from her. When the townsfolk learn she was in the bank just before it was robbed they peg her as an accomplice. Emma fuels the flames and a crowd ready for a hanging goes off in search of not just the gang but Vienna as well.

Most film critics and those who love this film come at it from the angle that it was an indictment of the Communist scare at the time. Often labeled McCarthyism, McCarthy had nothing to do with the Communist investigations in Hollywood. Those were led by the House Un-American Activities Committee or HUAC. It was through HUAC that the famed Hollywood ten came to be, ten film makers who were blacklisted in the business. It was HUAC that required names be provided in return for protection, a policy that led to a mob mentality in order to save your career if you worked in film.

That mob mentality in the face of innocence is what is portrayed in this film. While Vienna has done nothing wrong Emma incites the people of this town to hate her as much as she does. She encourages them to focus their ills on Vienna, stoking the flames until they are all ready to hang her without a shred of evidence.

My only problem was that this concept was laid on so thick it almost made any other plotline invisible at times. That may be that Im watching this film for the first time after having been made aware of its background. The film offers this side of the issue in the most extreme of emotions that at times it feels like it makes no sense that people would be this caught up in things without any provocation. Coming at it after years of history that also revealed a number of the things HUAC and McCarthy claimed were indeed factual also makes the movie different than it would have played when it was initially released.

The acting ranges from very good to somewhat lame with lines delivered by various characters who are then either believable or feel false. The situation also does the same. Perhaps that is because the extreme hatred between the characters of Vienna and Emma begin with their first scene together rather than develop, as if we walked in on a film with the first reel missing. Once you get the idea of what is happening it evens out though.

The film was released two years after HIGH NOON, another western that took on the same topic in an allegorical fashion. That film was much more subtle and played better. This isn't to fault this film, but this one seems more melodramatic than HIGH NOON. Perhaps thats due to fact the lead character moves from male to female during a time when women were more prone to melodrama than men in Hollywood films.

In the end the movie is entertaining and a piece of Hollywood history. For myself I was pleased as could be to have my first opportunity to see this film in a format and presentation that was high quality. Olive Films has released this movie as part of their Signature Series. This means that it will be the best quality print available and include several extras that will be worth watching. The extras on this release include an introduction to the film by Martin Scorsese, an audio commentary track with historian Geoff Andrew, Tell Us She Was One of You: The Blacklist History of Johnny Guitar a featurette with historian Larry Ceplair and blacklisted screenwriter Walter Bernstein, Is Johnny Guitar a Feminist Western?: Questioning the Canon a featurette with critics Miriam Bale, Kent Jones, Joe McElhaney and B. Ruby Rich, Free Republic: The Story of Herbert J. Yates and Republic Pictures a featurette with archivist Marc Wanamaker, a critical appreciation of Nicholas Ray with critics Miriam Bale, Kent Jones, Joe McElhaney and B. Ruby Rich, My Friend, the American Friend a featurette with a Nicholas Ray biographical piece with Tom Farrell and Chris Sievernich and Johnny Guitar: The First Existential Western an original essay by critic Jonathan Rosenbaum. This release also offers the film in 4k resolution so you are getting the highest quality reproduction of the film ever released on disc to date.

As a historical piece this film is finally getting the recognition it deserves. For film loves it is a joy to see classic films like this get the release they deserve. For me it was entertaining, interesting and a joy to watch. Fans of Crawford, westerns and film history will want to add this version of the film to their collection.",1475107200,,6907,4.538152610441767
660511,5,6303391931,"If you're looking for a ""classic western,"" you may not like this film as seems to be the case with a few reviewers. But if you're looking for a well-directed drama with intense personal relationships that just happens to be set in the old west, you're in for a treat. As Martin Scorcese pointed out in his introductory comments this Nicholas Ray classic was not terribly successful upon release. The film was appreciated in Europe more than in the USA. It's not heard to see why. I didn't much care for it on first viewing at a friend's video party 20 years ago. But something about it sticks with you-  the visuals and the relationship in the film between Joan Crawford and Mercedes McCambridge who practically foams at the mouth.  Her  Emma is a rich landowner who wants to control everything in the county, but can't control her own feelings for the Dancing Kid (or is it really Joan that gets her so riled up she wants her dead?).  Olive Films just released this on blu-ray a couple of years ago.  The new transfer from a 4k scan has a different aspect ration - 1:66 vs. the earlier 1:33.  So a little more information is available on the left and right and a bit missing from the top and bottom. It looks great.  If you're a fan of Nicholas Ray and/or this title, you are in for a treat.

Tough, intimidating, and impressionable, she steals the show with her edginess and flair. This movie more or less solidifies her as a Hollywood immortal, because of her versatility in playing an unlikely role. This movie doesn't crack the top 10 westerns of all time (in my opinion), but it can hold its own as an entertaining and believable movie. There's an excellent supporting cast as well.

660810,5,6303391931,"This 1954 Nicholas Ray western must be ranked as one of the very best on grounds of originality alone. As Martin Scorsese points out in his introduction on the DVD the film breaks all of the rules of the genre, emphasizing emotion and melodramatic excess over the usual classic (re Fordian) simplicity of the Wild West. Women replace men as the main protagonists and by giving everything a very artificial feel (use of color, especially the anarchic use of the colors red, white, black and the muting of blue) and resorting to operatic excess, Ray conjurs up a film of many layers of interpretation. These have been elucidated elsewhere by other reviewers. Whether you see it as feminist tract, Freudian psycho-investigation or McCarthy allegory, it all amounts to an engrossing, fascinating Western experience like no other. The film was a huge influence on Sergio Leone in Once Upon a Time in the West, with characters named after musical instruments, a story revolving around the building of a railroad community and by the use of operatic conventions. Where Ennio Morricone invokes Wagner with his use of leitmotifs, giving each character a different theme, Ray invokes Verdi and Puccini with the film's 'chorus' scenes (the first group encounter at ""Vienna's"" is long and especially reminiscent of the Verdi of say Simon Boccanegra) and intimate arias and duets between characters, the composer Victor Young's music sweeping the action along with tremendous subtlety and gushing drama when required. The acting is extraordinarily melodramatic, especially that of the two leading ladies. Joan Crawford looks to have stepped straight out of a silent film (I thought also of Gloria Swanson in Wilder's Sunset Boulevard) while Mercedes McCambridge plays an evil harridan as if she was Countess Eboli from Verdi's Don Carlos or the Wicked Witch of the West from Fleming's The Wizard of Oz - take your pick! Every scene barring the outside chase scenes feels like an operatic set-piece and it would be easy to criticise the film for being too over the top (I can readily understand American 1954 audiences laughing at the time). That is beside the point for me, for without the use of operatic excess and melodrama Ray would not have been able to create his fabulously original mythic landscape which prompts all those different sub-texts which have engrossed film experts (critics and directors alike) ever since it came out. Ray's treatment of the script is entirely tied to its content as is shown by the fact that his other westerns are treated so differently. As for the DVD itself, the quality is fine. The sharp picture and lush colors really stick out and excite the senses. Recommended to all lovers of westerns. Visconti enthusiasts would probably love it, too.",1413244800,4,2770,5.037037037037037

660813,4,6303391931,"I liked this atypical and deservedly famous 1954 western. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Somewhere in Arizona, in a little town whipped by winds, a tough, an aging saloonkeeper named Vienna (Joan Crawford, grandiose) struggles against the hostility of a local cattle baron John McIvers (Ward Bond), who doesn't appreciate her owning land and business in a place he considers as exclusive domain of himself and his cronies, like the owner of local bank. Even worse, the sister of the bank owner, Emma Small (Mercedes McCambridge, impressive), a woman probably mentally unbalanced, hates Vienna passionately for reasons which actually are not fully explained - and quite probably not fully known or understood even by herself...

Part of the reason for this hatred can be the jealousy - Emma indeed is fascinated (and in the same time repulsed) by Dancing Kid (Scott Brady) a guy who may or may not be a desperado but who certainly is a dashing dandy and lives in the mountains with his three tough henchmen (one of them played by Ernest Borgnine) looking for silver. Dancing Kid however always ignored Emma but intensely courted Vienna... And then, one fateful and eventful day a mysterious stranger rides in the town looking for Vienna - he introduces himself as Johnny Guitar (Sterling Hayden)... And then the film really begins.

Being essentially a confrontation between two very tough (and not very nice) gals, both of whom carry guns and know how to use them, this is, let's say it again, a very atypical western. The introduction of element of madness - not a very frequent thing in westerns - gives to it a very special taste. The irrational hatred Emma Small feels for Vienna allows for some moments which are really, really scary, even chilling as we can see the evil at work at its most vicious. In this film the great motivator is not the money, not the conflict of interests, not revenge and in fact not even jealousy - all those things either don't exist or are just pretexts - but simply a relentless will to destroy another human beings just BECAUSE!

The film has also some elements of parody - I found irresistible the scene in which a mysterious, dangeorus looking stranger arrives to a lawless town, carrying for the only weapon a guitar...))) There are many winks to the clichs of the genre, but all containing some parodic elements. On another hand there are also some pretty tough scenes - including a lynching...

Joan Crawford was 50 when she turned this film - and gosh, was she still hot, both when wearing virginal white and hellishly bright red! Sterling Hayden is excelellent as a Wild West troubadour who has a very special relationship with firearms - he avoids to touch them as much as possible and for a good reason (but I am not saying here why...) Mercedes McCambridge played here probably the role of her life as a woman who seems to be possessed by a demon - and it is probably not an accident that much later she was chosen to give her voice to Pazuzu in ""The exorcist""...)))

Maybe because it has some irrationality, grotesque and parody in it many people consider it as a major masterpiece - it certainly seems to be particularly liked in France. However, I am unable to rate it as high. Of course it is a good, interesting film and I enjoyed watching it - but I consider it rather as an interesting oddity, rather than a classic of the genre. Still, a recommended viewing. Enjoy!",1410739200,,3449,4.711442786069652
660814,5,6303391931,"For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this classic...

Johnny Guitar (1954) is a classic western that is many things rolled into one - drama, action, comedy, camp, romance, etc.  This is Joan Crawford in her later career.  She starred in a couple of westerns very early in her career, but this one tops those.  Crawford and co-star Mercedes McCambridge had an ongoing feud during production and the tension between them shows and is very apparent when you watch the movie.  This movie also stars Sterling Hayden, Ernest Borgnine, Scott Brady, Ward Bond, Ben Cooper, Paul Fix, Royal Dano, and John Carradine.  The acting is good by all.  The action is plentiful.  The color is striking.  The musical score is good as well.  This is an entertaining movie that, as good as it is, is somewhat underrated.

Highly recommended.",1407801600,,868,4.829931972789115
660815,4,6303391931,"What a movie!  What is it , a western , a chick flick , film noir, serious, or campy ? Whatever it was I loved it!",1407369600,,114,3.3846153846153846
660816,5,6303391931,"Mercedes McCambridge to Joan Crawford, ""I'm going to kill you.""  Joan Crawford's response ""I know, if I don't kill you first"".  With these two lines one could get the entire plot between these two women in this film.  Filming had to be done with as little contact with the only two women in this film.  Mercedes McCambridge was battling alcoholism at this time and work had to be difficult for her.  She certainly used the bitterness she found in life to good advantage for her acting in this film.  As a result of this and the personal conflicts between Joan Crawford and Mercedes McCambridge during filming, it is a wonder the picture was ever completed.  Joan Crawford and Sterling Hayden match up well in this picture, as Joan did with most of her male co-stars in any picture she ever made, although she openly admitted that Clark Gable and John Garfield were her favorite leading men.

The sets, location, and costumes are surrealistic in this most unusual of Western films, and in vivid color with a process used by Republic Studios at the time called Trucolor.  This particular color technique was of a lesser quality than the Technicolor process, but in this film came out exceedingly well, especially the Blu-Ray copy.  This was Joan Crawford's second color movie, the first being ""Torch Song"" filmed in Technicolor at MGM.  All of Joan Crawford's earlier work, and especially the Film Noir films of the 1940's, including her Academy Award winning role in ""Mildred Pierce"" (1945 and made at Warner Bros.), were made in the more appropriate Black and White process.

Ward Bond helps to unify this Western to the standard most generally recognized by the American public as he was cast in many Westerns, and later the popular lead in Television's long running ""Wagon Train"" series not to specifically forget his roles in ""Gone With The Wind"", ""Virginia City"" and many, many other films.  Ward Bond was one of the great character Actors in Hollywood films and a staple character primarily at Warner Bros. for many years, then very popular on Television.

The unique qualities created by Director Nicholas Ray help to create a Western unlike any you will ever see not to forget the title song ""Johnny Guitar"" hauntingly sung by Peggy Lee.  Joan Crawford is at her best in this film, the consummate Actress and Star.

This film has developed a cult following in Europe (especially France), and certainly has its' fans in the United States.  It is one of the most unusual American Western films ever made.

660928,5,6303391931,"This and many other post 1953 films were shot in full-frame 1.37 ratio. Theatres that had installed new wide screens would crop the top and bottom leaving them with a widescreen 1.85 picture. This could be done because the cameraman would compose the scenes with unimportant but not objectionable things at the top and bottom of the frame. These films were meant to be shown in the preferred 1.85 widescreen ratio. At the same time small town theatres that didn't have the resources to buy new wide screens and two new projection lenses could exhibit the film in the full frame format. Even today, half of the films are shot in full frame leaving it up to the theatres to crop the top and bottom. These films were also shot full frame so they would be ready for sale to television. If you have a widescreen television set your picture to ZOOM and you'll crop just enough on the top and bottom to make an almost 1.85 widescreen picture. TRY IT! You'll be glad you did. I saw JOHNNY GUITAR at a drive-in theatre in Phoenix in 1954 in full frame. They didn't build a new widescreen until a few years later. As has been mentioned in other reviews JOHNNY was filmed in TRUCOLOR. This was a less expensive process used almost exclusively by Republic Pictures mostly for their westerns including about a dozen Roy Rogers films from 1948 until 1953. I always thought TRUCOLOR to be a pretty good process. CINECOLOR was also an inexpensive process used by a good number of major studios (Columbia and Paramount) and a lot of small studios on certain low-budget films. To my eyes CINECOLOR could not compare to TRUCOLOR. I was only 13 when I saw JOHNNY but I remember having the feeling that I had never seen a western like this before. I haven't seen the BLU RAY yet but I'll have mine in about a week. I've just read some of the other reviews and I'm ordering mine after I finish this writing.

Joan Crawford, in her role as Vienna, standing alone against the good townsfolk is unforgettable in her own right as the free spirited passion-filled defender of individuality. Problem I have is that I remember scenes that were filmed in darker color tones than the film shows on Blu-ray. I did not remember it having such vivid colors in some of the other scenes.

However, if you can look past the corny acting and somewhat stale jokes, you may just find appreciation for one of the most overlooked films of the '50s.

This is old Joan back in the Old West, where men were men and (and least in Crawford's case) women were men.

It has weird Freudian implications in its depiction of a catfight between two strong women.  A Hollywood fifties saloon, complete with shiny floors and accoutrements and a beautiful grand piano is the main setting that sets tone of set decoration.  ""Vienna"" (Joan Crawford), the saloon owner has done all this, plus with employing a staff to operate her saloon in the five years since she sent the retired gunslinger, now named ""Johnny Guitar"" (Sterling Hayden) who she has recently ""re-hired"" to play guitar, away.  The property is worth something since the train is coming through.  The town, however, is really owned by the woman who bankrolls all the money, rancher and lynch-happy, and sexually repressed ""Emma"" (played by Mercedes McCambridge) who really wants the man (""The Dancin' Kid"") ""Vienna"" entertained herself while Johnny was away (played by Scott Brady), ""tramp"" that she is.  Others in the cast include Ward Bond, Ernest Borgnine, Ben Cooper and John Carradine.  It is perhaps director Nicholas Ray's most discussed work besides ""Rebel Without a Cause"" several years later.  It is certainly original, a feminist western, that probably had not been called upon to appeal to audiences until Sharon Stone did ""The Quick and the Dead.""  But still as any Joan Crawford picture there is a lot of cliches thrown in, but today the camp effect does not go overboard as the Philip Yordan screenplay, as directed by Ray, keeps a lid on it.  Still, there may be some truth to the insinuation that Scorsese may have been hard-up for the money Olive Films gave him to do the endorsement, which he lavishes with a lot of technical mumbo jumbo, especially how Ray was called the ""Poet of the Dark"" or something like that by the French New Wave directors for his night scenes.

661083,3,6303391931,"I had read a number of glowing reviews about this movie over the last few years; ""a forgotten classic"", ""racy"", ""cult film"", etc., which sparked my interest.
A fan of old westerns, I was ""sold"" but the movie wasn't available on DVD until 2012.  I bought the Blue Ray disc from Amazon, and had some elevated
expectations on how this movie was going to be.

Turns out the scenery in the movie is just beautiful; angled rocks mixed with forest and clear streams; perfect backdrop for a western.  The Blue Ray
disc has a very crisp and clear look to it but as expected from a movie from the period, a mono soundtrack with clear sounding mono.

The acting is overdone at times.  Mercedes McCambridge is just too wooden.  The actors & actresses were all very well-known and popular at the time.
The real problem is, the movie is just OK, nothing special, after all.  Sure you can see some serious tension between Crawford and McCambridge,
but those opportunities arn't as often as I would have liked.  There are some holes in the plot and the movie just comes across as plain dumb and
contrived sometimes.  To me it neither succeeds as a serious film nor a campy film.

Bonus material only includes a short 5-or-so minute introduction by Martin Scorsese, who must have been given some quick cash to hype up a weak
movie as much as he does here.  That's pretty skimpy for a Blue Ray disc.  It'd have been nice to have the original trailer, and if there are so many ""legends"" of tension and stuff during
the filming, why isn't there a featurette which addresses it?  Perhaps that was just Hollywood hype, too.

For a ""cult classic"", well let's just leave it at that.  There may be a cult following but some may be seriously disappointed after reading all the
hype.  My girlfriend watched it with me and she also was just not very impressed when it was finally over.

We both agreed that what on earth was considered ""racy"" from this film in 1954?  Could have been that strong willed women could make it on their own
and build and run a business in the untamed old west?  Perhaps it was because of a couple of romantic kisses?  Nothing racy there.  Could it have been
because Joan Crawford was briefly shown in just a full-body slip and showed a small part of a bare leg for one second?  I just don't get it.  I wasn't
alive in 1954 to judge it.

So basically don't expect this movie to shock or impress you much.  It's an OK western, but me, I like many other old westerns better than Johnny Guitar.",1357862400,,2491,4.433920704845815

661129,5,6303391931,"My review of the Korean DVD has disappeared for no obvious reason, so it's back to the drawing board.

""Johnny Guitar"" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". How about just plain weird? Not only is the magenta-lipped Crawford unbelievable as any sort of ""Western"" female (other than perhaps a bordello employee with Really Bad taste), but her performance is too often mannered and over the top. Much of the time she looks like Carol Burnett impersonating Norma Desmond. (""Johnny Guitar"" is perfect fodder for a Burnett spoof. Had it been a well-known film, we might have seen one.)

Yes, it's a bad Western, because it's not a Western. The other reviews do a good job explaining what this film is really ""about"", so there's no point repeating them. My favorite comic moment (which was probably intentional) comes near the beginning when Vienna (yes, that's her name) enters her upstairs living quarters -- and there's a huge bust of Beethoven in the background. One wonders why, at the end, she doesn't exclaim ""Wait, Johnny! I forgot my bust of Beethoven!"" I also like the description of Bart's (Ernest Porcine's) anomalous behavior: ""You don't smoke, you don't drink, and you hate horses!"".

As for the transfer... TruColor was Consolidated Film Industries' version of three-strip Technicolor, and ""Johnny Guitar"" looks very much like an excellent Technicolor IB print. Compared to the Korean DVD, the color gamut is wider and the saturation less ""in your face"". There's a big improvement in detail (note the stitching in Vienna's yellow blouse), and the periodic ""judder"" that disfigured the DVD is gone. Those owning the DVD will probably want to upgrade.

""Johnny Guitar"" is an oddity not for everyone's taste. I've seen it several times, and enjoy it very much.",1353974400,5,1869,5.118032786885246

661233,5,6303391931,"85us Johnny Guitar by Nicholas Ray (1954, 110')

'Johnny Guitar is a 1954 Republic Pictures Western film drama film starring Joan Crawford, Sterling Hayden, Mercedes McCambridge, and Scott Brady. The screenplay was based upon a novel by Roy Chanslor. Though credited to Philip Yordan, he was merely a front for the actual screenwriter, blacklisted Ben Maddow. 'The film was directed by Nicholas Ray and produced by Herbert Yates. The title song, ""Johnny Guitar"", written by Peggy Lee and Victor Young and originally sung by Peggy Lee herself is a hugely popular song covered many times. This was the last feature film produced by Republic Pictures in its Trucolor process. '

Jealous of a younger Mercedes McCambridge, Crawford fought but failed to have Claire Trevor cast in the Emma Small role. After filming, McCambridge and Hayden publicly declared their dislike of Crawford, with McCambridge labeling Crawford, ""a mean, tipsy, powerful, rotten-egg lady."" Variety commented, ""It proves Crawford should leave saddles and Levis to someone else and stick to city lights for a background. In an interview in the Criterion Collection version of The Killing, Sterling Hayden stated that he did not care for Johnny Guitar. ""They put string, like you get at the grocery store, over my guitar in case I accidentally hit them...""

Despite his reservations about the film, Hayden acknowledged its popularity. Many critics have pointed out that the film is a hidden commentary on the McCarthy witch-hunts. US critics felt it was only a fair piece of entertainment, so involved with character nuances and neuroses, that the picture never has a chance to rear up in the saddle... The film, certainly more than just a Western, was loved by French critics and filmmakers -- Franois Truffaut called it ""a phony Western"", the ""Beauty and the Beast of Westerns, a Western dream"". Truffaut was especially impressed by the film's extravagance: the bold colors, the poetry of the dialogue in certain scenes, and the theatricality which results in cowboys vanishing and dying ""with the grace of ballerinas"".

(I have edited and abridged the above review from Wikipedia material - RC)

Truffaut is right: True Western or not, it is a masterpiece! In a way, it anticipates major elements of the Italo Western by more than a decade.

661234,5,6303391931,"2012 will be the year of Joan Crawford as two of her greatest films finally have a well-deserved release on DVD for the first time here in North America. The first is 1955's ""Female on the Beach"" which comes out in June and the second is this classic ""Johnny Guitar"" which arrived in theatres the previous year.

 Although ""Johnny Guitar"" bombed at the box office it has gone on to become a true western classic and is beloved by many including Martin Scorsese who is interviewed in a special bonus feature. The movie also found a huge following in France and other countries.

 Joan Crawford herself hated the movie stating, ""I should have had my head examined. No excuse for a film being this bad or for me making it. I never knew what the hell the script was about half the time"". Personally I believe Joan was too hard on herself. A lot of what she felt about the film was due to what was going on in her personal life during the making of it. She had four kids to support, a dwindling career and she was getting older, not to mention her and co-star Mercedes McCambridge didn't get along off set. During a scene in which the crew applauded Mercede's performance Joan ran off. Later that night while drunk Joan broke into McCambridge's dressing room, took all her cloths for the next day's filming and scattered them over the Arizona highway where the movie was being shot.

 The plot is pretty simple in that it deals with two strong-willed women played by Joan and McCambridge who do battle as Joan's character owns a saloon and McCambridge's character wants her out of town as she feels she's trouble. Snarling at Crawford in one scene Mercedes exclaims, ""Your nothin' but a railroad tramp!"", a line I have since used in different situations.

 There is still some confusion over the aspect ratio of the release, but hopefully it will come out in its beautiful widescreen format as it was originally made. The movie is available in both Blu Ray and DVD.",1338163200,27,1960,4.564102564102564

Ergo, this ""western"".  Everybody loves this. The French do.  Why?  Nicholas Ray directs the mess and and Ray fans stand by it.  ""It's a classic"", they say.  ""The hidden meanings are everywhere"" they say.  ""The nuances are priceless"" they say.

Who are ""they""?  When you have Ernest Borgnine showing up as a cowboy, you know from the get-go that you're in trouble.

And trouble is everywhere.  Not crabs-left-over-from-a-one-night-stand trouble.  But big time trouble.  Ernest Borgnine?????

Mercedes McCambridge (did I spell that correctly?) is a mess in a dress. Actually, it's not even a dress.  More like something the Wicked Witch of the West would have thrown aside.  All she does is yell and only because she hasn't had an orgasm in ten years.  Her rage and jealousy and pistol-popping angst must've looked good on paper, but in the hands of the actress, becomes deplorable.  Her rage pushes the pedal at top speed through out the flm and she never lets up.  I've no idea why.  Certainly ""the Dancin' Kid"" can't have that big of a schwang. He really doesn't look like he's packing that much.

Ah, but maybe he is.

And there's Joan.  And if you're dealing with Joan, you'd better be packing some serious meat.  But here she is: Seducing one man, flirting with another, and, eventually, sleeping with another.  Joan's character, Vienna, likes sex, and she's not ashamed of it at all. Mercedes thinks that Joan wants ""the Dancin' Kid"" (WTF?) but we all know that Joan wants Johnny Guitar (WTF?)  Who names these people?  What drunken SOB at 3:00 a.m. thought that this was a good idea?  Well, someone did, sold it to Republic Studios, splashed on the Technicolor, Joan signed on, and here we are.

Ernest Borgnine????

Joan's angry.  Joan is repentent. Joan's clever and ""knows the boys"".  Joan's a whore (""for every board, plank and beam....."")  She hides out in a cabin with the cowbowys and does laundry. Laundry, you know, like every cowboy does.  Emerging, a la Joan, in a YELLOW SHIRT and then, when things get really bad, she tries to hide herself in the night, while God knows how many people are looking for her, in a WHITE WHITE dress!!!!!

For camp lovers, it's really not even ""camp"".  For Crawford lovers, it's an embarassement (but isn't that why we love her?) and for fans of the Western film genre, forget it.

661239,3,6303391931,"For starters, I am not the biggest fan of the Western in general.  It really takes a lot to win me over in this particular genre, since I have placed a stigma on the mere title and always tend to walk into these films with a layer of apprehension that is hard to shake off.  Some have prevailed, but most (even the lauded ones) fail to do anything special for me.  In all honesty, I would have never watched this film had some friends lauded the heck out of Crawford's performance; otherwise I would have steered clear (considering that Crawford is not really one of the legends I am eternally fond of).

I cannot say that this is a good film, because it's overridden camp values are far too uneven to be anything commendable, but there are certain facets of this film that are outstanding in all honesty (Crawford included) that it certainly deserves to be seen and discussed.

The story revolves around a saloon owner named Vienna who is loathed by a sexually repressed woman named Emma.  Emma is infatuated with the outlaw known as the Dancin' Kid, but the Kid is semi-smitten with Vienna, who really isn't interested in his nonsense.  Instead, Vienna has just hired Johnny Guitar, formally badboy Johnny Logan, and is obviously interested in picking up where they left off (he is an old flame), but Logan is hesitant considering that the Kid's advances seem rather forthright and possibly reciprocated.  Emma, seeking revenge upon Vienna for being more of a woman than she'll ever be, attempts to have the entire lot of them hung when the Kid and his cohorts rob a local bank.  This leads to a lynch mob being formed and Logan finally snapping out of his catatonic stupor long enough to `get the girl'.

The movie is kind of a mess.  The sad reality is that it somewhat lays flat throughout half the film.  The film is really three or so long scenes drug out for dramatic effect, but Crawford (and to an extent Scott Brady) seem to be the only ones understanding the dramatic nature of the piece.  Everyone else is either overdoing it to horribly caricatured degrees or not attempting anything at all.  Sterling Hayden is lifeless in the role.  He doesn't brood in the way that makes you wonder whats going on inside, he simple fizzles before your very eyes.  Mercedes McCambridge (in perma-stank face) is atrocious here.  Her acting is the epitome of poor, overdoing every gesture and facial expression to the point where she comes across like a psychotic eleven-year-old suffering from constipation.  I just wish that the initial premise had been more deeply explored to create a fuller film.  At the end of the day, `Johnny Guitar' feels somewhat hollow.

But then there is the good.  Crawford is simply divine.  Like I mentioned, she isn't really my cup of tea.  I've liked her before, but I never understood the hoopla surrounding her celebrity before.  She was on the lower tier of celebrated actresses, nowhere near as profound or talented as the likes of Ingrid Bergman, Bette Davis or Deborah Kerr.  She was constantly too aware of her face, contorting it to express herself in a way that read falsified and far from natural.  That `problem' was actually a major plus for her here because it played to the campy nature of the film while building a background for this woman that wasn't truly expounded on within the script.  Then there was the cinematography, which was delightful (even if most of the backdrops were obviously painted), and that score by Victor Young (complete with that song sung by Patti Page is sublime.  The score may be one of the greatest film scores of all time; seriously.

So in the end, I recommend this.  You may like it far more than I, considering my apathy towards the genre in general.  It is certainly a mess, but a hot one at that.",1319760000,4,3778,4.653092006033183

661291,2,6303391931,"Holy guacamole this is a bad movie. I think with it's existential, stilted uncomfortable dialog and the kabuki theater stylings it should be much more interesting than it is. And it was directed by Nicholas Ray? I guess we all have bad days. Joan Crawford is positively scary in her make-up mask that never twitches no matter what the scene is. Tears come but they don't mess the face because I think her make-up repels water. And Sterling Hayden? Why do I keep thinking of the wolf in that Hoodwinked animated kid's movie? And finally, those two are supposed to be in love? Isn't she a bit...embalmed...for him? Eeeeeeeeeee

Anyway, the story as it is, revolves around ""Vienna"" the fallen woman who has built a saloon on the edge of town that apparently accepts all clientele including the underaged. She is canoodling with a bank robber called, get this, the Dancing Kid. However she gets to pining for her old lover Johnny Guitar. He shows up, Dancing Kid gets all snooty, the bank gets robbed, gunplay ensues, there are some explosions and there's a cat-fight with more gunplay at the end.

The other actors around the two leads apparently took this assignment seriously and hand in perfectly normal performances. Joan and Sterling, however, should have been sent back to community theater and please, someone wash that garish red gash off that woman's face.

661293,5,6303391931,"""Johnny Guitar"" (1954) stands alone with ""Rancho Notorious"" (1952) as one of the quirkiest of all westerns ever filmed. Both of them come in the early 50s when westerns were so popular that everyone was looking for a new twist. TV westerns were also starting to be popular, with ""The Lone Ranger"" (1949-57), ""The Cisco Kid"" (1950-6), ""Hopalong Cassidy"" (1951-2), ""Wild Bill Hickock"" (1951-8), etc. Hence we have the Jimmy Stewart/Anthony Mann westerns - ""Winchester 73"" (1950), ""Bend of the River"" (1952), ""The Naked Spur"" (1953), ""The Far Country"" (1954), ""The Man from Laramie"" (1955) - that show a hero who has a dark side, and even John Ford revised his western themes at this time with films like ""The Searchers"" (1956).

""Johnny Guitar"" sets itself apart by having a female star and a female villain, as well as steeping itself in sexuality of all shapes and sizes.

Joan Crawford (1905-77) plays ""Vienna"", a saloon keeper. By 1954 Crawford's star was not yet in decline. She'd starred in ""Grand Hotel"" (1932), was named ""Queen of the Movies"" by Life magazine in 1937, won the Academy Award in 1945 (""Mildred Pierce""), and was nominated again in 1947 (""Possessed"") and 1952 (""Sudden Fear""). But following Johnny Guitar, her 82nd film, she turned her attention to television and to Pepsi, the firm her new husband was involved in.

Sterling Hayden (1916-86) had so many memorable roles it's hard to begin - General Jack D Ripper in ""Dr Strangelove"",  King Zharko in ""King of the Gypsies"",  the corrupt police captain in ""The Godfather Part 1"", Jim Bowie in ""The Last Command"",  and Dix Hardley in ""The Asphalt Jungle"", etc. In this film, another bravura performance, Hayden plays Crawford's former boyfriend, a guitar playing gunman.

This was Mercedes McCambridge's (1916-2004) finest role as the evil Emma, a woman who hates Crawford.  Known for her work in radio, she had a breakthrough in ""All The King's Men"" (1949) for which she won a best supporting actress award. Off screen she had bitter arguments with Joan Crawford, so the enmity we see on screen is real.

Scott Brady (1924-85) plays ""The Dancin' Kid"" and he's a hoot, especially in contrast to the somber Crawford and Hayden. Brady specialized in playing tough guys in more than 100 films and TV shows.

BTW - McCambridge loves Brady who loves Crawford loves Hayden, and they're all wearing guns!

This film has so many good supporting actors it's hard to know whom to single out. The great Ward Bond (1903-60) plays a villain, one of the few times he wore the black hat. Bond was a staple of John Ford movies, often with his old college chum John Wayne. After nearly 200 films, Bond moved to TV where he led the ""Wagon Train"" from 1957 until his death in 1960.

Ernie  Borgnine (1917) plays one of the bad good guys, the heavy being one of Borgnine's specialties, and one for which he received an AA nomination in ""From Here to Eternity"" (he won the next year for ""Marty"").

John Carradine (1906-88)  is wasted in a minor role as the cook at Crawford's saloon.  Carradine and Bond were John Ford repertoire players, Carradine appearing in 10 Ford films, the most notable of which were ""Stagecoach"" and ""The Grapes of Wrath"".

Rhys Williams (1897-1969) is one of those faces you remember, but not the name. He was in dozens of films, but I remember him best in one of his last films, ""The Sons of Katie Elder"" (1965), as the man who tells John Wayne about his dead mother.

Royal Dano (1922-94) plays another one of Scott Brady's bunch. Dano is best known for his resonant voice. As a result, he often played significant people, like Lincoln, Elijah, John Brown, and even Jesus.

Ben Cooper (1933) gives one of his best performances as the young hot head ""Turkey."" Winner of a Golden Boot in 2005 for his work in westerns, Cooper was at home on the big screen as well as TV.

For director Nicholas Ray (1911-79), ""Johnny Guitar"" was part of his 1-2 punch in the mid 50s. In 1955 he directed ""Rebel without a Cause."" Ray favored youth and rebels, and in Johnny Guitar we see this in the portrayal of Turkey by Ben Cooper. Indeed, in a film populated with actors who play unsympathetic roles, it is only Turkey for whom we have deep regrets. Ray was also good showing repressed sexuality (remember Sal Mineo in Rebel) and we see this theme throughout Johnny Guitar. Ray was also well known for his use of color, and Johnny Guitar shot in RKO's trucolor process not only has bold colors, but Ray constantly plays with colors throughout the film (e.g., Joan Crawford appears in black when we expect her to be more social, and later in white when the mood turns somber).

The top grossing films in 1954 were ""White Christmas"", ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"", ""Rear Window"", ""Carmen Jones"", and ""The Caine Mutiny"". Bogart had 2 films in the top 10 as did Bing Crosby. The big Oscar winner was ""On the Waterfront"" (Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actress). Other notable films released that year were ""Dial M for Murder"", ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon"", ""Godzilla"", and ""The High and the Mighty"".

At the time, Variety called it ""only a fair piece of entertainment"" and the NY Times said it was ""a flat walk-through -- or occasional ride-through--of western cliches."" On later evaluation, the NY Times elevated it to a ""Top Critics Pick"" and in 2008 the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.

Westerns fans need to see this film to see what can be done within the constraints of a western. And fans of good acting will also find it enjoyable, as well fans of Nic Ray.",1312934400,3,5582,4.714285714285714
661294,5,6303391931,"I saw this movie for the first time in my life at the Aero theatre in Santa Monica on August 5, 2011, after having heard of it for years.  It is an excellent, unique movie.  If it can be as good via a DVD on a TV at home, then buy this product.  But if you ever get the opportuity to see this movie at a movie theatre-Do It.  You  start thinking everybody acting is kind of going for comedy in how we interpret them, but then you take it seriously.  It is like a Shakespearean drama.  You can see why Joan Crawford was a MOVIE STAR.  Before Mommie Dearest, I really did not know her, and then I adopted the Mommie Dearest view. So I never bothered to ""learn"" her movies as I would try for Humphrey Bogart.  This movie is just great in showing her face in unique ways.  Not beautiful, but mesmerizing.  I think this movie totally lives up to its re-evaluation since release time critical opinion. Ray's take then and now would be anti republican, anti Tea Party, i.e. the Posse, representing the self righteous ones acting as the government-who carry out illegal lynchings.  And what I mean is like great literature, each age can interpret things for themselves.  They had been writing about how there is symbolism of the posse being House UnAmerican Activities Committee, all republicans, and Mercedes as Joseph McCarthy from 1954.  But today, I think you could interpret them as tea party Republicans in their very wrong position.  Anyway, here is the other personal note.  I went to Sedona, Arizona for the first time for a vacation in April 2011.  So then I see this movie for the first time tonight, August 5, 2011--and as we go around with the characters with seeing the geography where they are, I think that looks like Sedona.  And then they showed more and I thought it really looked like Sedona-which we had taken a Jeep tour all around to see these formations.  Then I remember, in Sedona they have a museum for movies that were filmed there.  There are so many that they have a list, like 50 or so.  But then I was thinking that this movie must have been on the list.  So then I went home and googled this movie, and it quickly got to an article about the events during the filming at Sedona-how Joan Crawford and Mercedes really did not like each other.  So, in other words, I would not have recognized it if I had first seen the movie and then gone to Sedona.  But now the true authentic Sedona Arizona can be appreciated.  Looks good 50 years, almost 60 years later.  Greaat movie",1312588800,,2494,4.426373626373627
661295,1,6303391931,"I grew up in a small town with a ""show"" within walking distance. Admission was .14 cents.  I was hooked on Westerns since my first at 7 years old (Roy Rogers' ""Grand Canyon Trail"").  There were at least 2 or 3 ""A"" Westerns a month and a ""B"" every Saturday.  I've never understood what ""camp"" means in film references but ""darn good Western"" just about says it all about ""JG"".  I have watched this movie at least 30 times and can recite dialogue word-for-word almost all the way from ""What's your pleasure?"" to Ward Bond's ""This was her fight, has been all along"". It is way out ahead of my other favorites, ""Shane"", ""Rio Bravo"", ""Devils Doorway"", ""The Magnificent Seven"". (No, I don't do ""High Noon""). There is no other Western like it. It is like Shakespeare goes to Arizona.  I agree with other commentors who can't fathom why there are so many terrible Westerns on DVD (eg. ""Billy The Kid Vs. Dracula""), that you can find in discount stores and flea markets for a dollar or two, and there is no legitimate remastered US production of ""JG"", or ""The Silver Whip"", or ""Rose Of Cimarron"", or ""From Hell To Texas"", etc, etc.
  The first third takes place in a saloon that is some ways away from the town, for several reasons. Verbal wars take place between Vienna (saloon owner), Johnny (her bodyguard and former lover), ""Dancing Kid"" (seemingly innocent robbery/murder suspect), Emma (mentally disturbed, attention deprived matriarch, with an ego the size of texas), and Mr. McIvers (big time rancher subordinated by Emma). The conversations range from taut and heavy to light and comical. The second third somewhat enlightens the first third and lays the basis for the last. The last third is an action packed, well directed, superbly acted chase with a surprise ending (i.e.,the first time you see it).
  It's hard to understand why Joan Crawford denied this movie.  I never like any of her others, but loved this one even though both she and Mercedes McCambridge overacted slightly (which only added spice).

661299,5,6303391931,"Whenever I lecture before general audiences or film students and explain what elements comprise the essential grammar of cinema (the lighting, performances, editing, costumes, art direction, script, music, photography, etc), I ALWAYS use the opening 15 minutes of Johnny Guitar. Nothing, aside from Rebel Without a Cause, made the following year by the same director (Nicholas Ray), better communicates these features more palpably -- and interestingly -- than this film. Yet despite these virtues, the film is hardly known in its native country. Although it was initially a popular hit in the US, the critics didn't take to it (its feminist theme and gender bending were decades ahead of their time) and so it eventually fell away from consciousness and distribution. In contrast, however, the French instantly recognized its achievement, followed by the British.

661348,5,6303391931,"""Johnny Guitar"" was one of many melodramtic films Joan Crawford made after her career was resurged again in 1952 with the release of the masterpiece ""Sudden Fear"". After her two-picture deal fell through due to the failure of ""Torch Song"" Joan, again, went independent to Republic Studios to make this western. As with most cowboy movies the leads always dealt with men, but in this outing the two main antagonists were played to ultimate perfection by Joan and Mercedes McCambridge, a former Oscar winner who is mostly known to current audiences as the voice of the demon in 1973's ""The Exorcist"". Joan and Mercedes play women who are at extreme odds with one another as the Crawford character wants to build a town when the railroad goes through much to the chagrin of the nearest town's people headed by McCambridge.

 Filmed in glorious color ""Johnny Guitar"" became a financial and critical flop upon its release in 1954 that led Joan into a financial and professional decline. She stated, ""The phone stopped ringing and when I would call people they were never home"". However, in recent decades the film has gone on to cult camp status especially in France where audiences have always loved the movie.

 Joan would state years later that ""I should have had my head examined (for making ""Johnny Guitar""). No excuse for a film this bad or for me making it"". When one looks at the context of Joan's words you have to remember what she was actually going through in her personal life. She had four kids she was keeping in boarding schools, a household to run, very little money, a career that was on the skids, and various lovers who never appreciated her. Not to mention the fact she was getting older and having a hard time to find movie roles.

 This particular release of ""Johnny Guitar"" was only released in Korea and it has never had a North American release on DVD or Blue Ray, only VHS.",1294876800,,1895,4.675675675675675
661349,5,6303391931,"If may be so bold, Johnny Guitar is probably the greatest western of all time. Johnny Guitar stars Joan Crawford as Vienna and Sterlying Hayden as the name sake character. Hayden has a screen presence here equal to Robert Mitchum, a laid back style mixed with an innate swarthiness and sexual charisma. Johnny ""Guitar"" was in fact Johnny Logan, a dangerous gunslinger who abandoned his old life for music. His former lover, Vienna, contacts Logan to play music for her saloon. Despite Vienna's hard-as-nails exterior, she was repulsed by darker side of Logan. Still, the two never really stopped loving each other. They both become potential victims of a vindictive woman named Emma Small. Small was dating an outlaw named ""Dancin' Kid"" but The Kid left her for Vienna. Now Emma rallied a deputy and a blood thirsty posse against them both and all hell breaks loose.

Nicholas Ray directed this Johnny Guitar and really, who better for the job. Ray's best work such as On Dangerous Ground, In a Lonely Place, and Rebel Without a Cause explored how flawed human beings are not monsters and/or the ugly side of ignorance. He does no less in Johnny Guitar. Emma Small manipulates a town that already feared the rapidly growing and increasingly ""fenced-in"" western United States in the form of Vienna's Saloon. Logan represents that living an entirely peaceful life is nearly futile when a town is entirely against you; Words only go so far. The film gives an excuse for the violence not for the sake simply saving oneslife but living in a world where people can get what they want by playing on fears.

Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, Johnny Guitar has yet to see a Region 1 DVD release. A shame since Guitar so sorely deserves it.",1292284800,,1740,4.777408637873754

661352,4,6303391931,"JOHNNY GUITAR qualifies as a guilty pleasure, like other bad movies that I like in spite of themselves.

What should we provide as a tag-line for this off-beat western? See Joan get tough with a small handgun: ""Anyone else think I'm lying?"" See Joan duke it out verbally with the character aptly named Emma Small: ""You have it backwards, Emma. You want him (the Dancing Kid) so much you want to see him dead."" (paraphrase) See the film the French fell in love with, for some inexplicable reason. Even the quintessential French director Francois Truffaut admired the set-up of the black-suited posse positioned in Vienna's gambling emporium in the shape of an inverted V. . . so much so that he imitates it with the firemen in FAHRENHEIT 451. He even admired the two-strip color process known as Trucolor and wished that he could use it instead of Technicolor for his apocalyptic story of book burning. Fortunately, wiser heads prevailed, and we have this atypical Truffaut anti-utopia film in Technicolor.

Joan's adversary in the film, well-played by radio queen Mercedes McCambridge (hear some of her radio drama broadcasts on Mystery Play-1 MPIR Old Time Radio on iTunes), matches her line for line: ""Someday I'm going to kill you."" ""I know,"" counters Joanie Dearest who is having her status as Queen Bee challenged. ""If I don't kill you first."" Stunning dialogue, matched only by comic book dialogue or lame speeches found in spaghetti westerns. ""I always wanted to kill me a guitar man,"" says Dancin' Kid (Scott Brady). ""That's a noble ambition,"" Vienna tells him. This may be her most logical line of dialogue in the film. Of course, it is appropriate for the Dancin' Kid who behaves like the second word in his name when he sees a rival return to Vienna's life.

In other scenes in the film, she contradicts herself. She draws a handgun on the townspeople and cattlemen that Emma has led to her saloon, telling them that she can shoot any two men who try to drag her down from the staircase. Later, she fires Johnny Guitar for being too gun crazy, saying that she abhors violence. Why is it again she hires him? for his guitar playing or for his prowess with a gun? She drops enough hints throughout that she has slept with many men in order to get what she wants -- a stake in the claim of a new town when the railroad comes through -- yet claims to be so virtuous when it comes to defending herself. She tells a railroad executive that she met his railroad surveyor and ""we exchanged confidences."" What a skillful way of explaining how she slept with the surveyor in exchange for information that would put her in a good position financially once the blasting heard in the distance throughout much of the film is finished and rails are put down near her saloon. ""How many men have you forgotten?"" JG asks her when they are finally alone at night. ""As many women as you have remembered,"" she replies. C'mon now, are we supposed to take this dialogue seriously, or hoot at the screen? She accuses JG of feeling sorry for himself, yet does the same when she explains the sacrifices she has had to endure in order to build her gambling palace. She first appears in femme fatale black with a gun strapped to her leg, then in a fetching red gown, then in a white gown that could be used for a wedding dress, then in a red shirt and jeans, and finally in a yellow shirt -- the latter having belonged to the youngster Ben Cooper after he is lynched. When JG changes out of his wet clothes in the cabin of the silver-mining foursome turned into bank robbers, he emerges from a room wearing dry clothes and a gun-belt. Whose gun-belt it is we never know, but it is enough to make DK nervous, particularly when Joan tells DK that JG is really Johnny Logan. DK starts to draw on Logan, and Logan beats him to the draw. Then the Kid points out what an itchy trigger finger he has. I mean, does anyone in this film take responsibility for his/her own actions and big mouth?

What the name Johnny Logan really means is never explained. We can assume that he is/was some formidable gunslinger, but we never know for sure. Anyway, Vienna tells JG that when a fire burns out, all you have left are ashes -- a line my ex-wife borrowed from this film to use against me. . . before we were married. A few moments later, Vienna falls into JG's arms and tells him that she did miss him and asks why it took him so long to return to her. Okay. Conflicted characters, you say, people with contradictory feelings and more than one name.

Speaking of names -- what about the title? Even though the film is named JOHNNY GUITAR, this character as played by Sterling Hayden is not the center of the film. Like the other male characters who are kept under the thumb of the two female antagonists, he is cowed by Vienna. Around her, he becomes not the watchdog he was hired to be but a lapdog. He is nearly a head taller than his adversaries -- particularly the villainous character played by Ernest Borgnine whose face looks like it has been used for a punching bag one too many times. JG gets to gun down only one character, and that in order to save the life of the person who is his rival for the affections of Vienna. Maybe the title should have called VIENNA'S SALOON since so much of the action, including one excruciatingly lengthy scene near the beginning, takes place within its walls. This is a shame since the exterior scenery is quite stunning and intimidating, the way that Blanco Canyon and the vast wide-open terrain over-power the characters in THE BIG COUNTRY.

Ward Bond is an interesting character -- a man who wants to throw his weight around as the kingpin rancher and yet draw the line at hanging a boy and a woman. He tells the one law enforcement person to ""go fishing until this is over"" but finally says, near the end, that there has been enough killing. Maybe he can be seen as being contradictory, like Vienna at times, or as being a human with a good side and a shadow side, like most of us in the real world. He was a likable supporting actor on the big screen (such as in westerns like RIO BRAVO) and in his stint on the long-running TV series WAGON TRAIN. His death in a plane crash created a loss for all of us, not unlike that of The Big Bopper, Richie Valens, and Buddy Holly. DK as played by Scott Brady (noted for other Republic films such as the scene-borrowing MOHAWK) is another conflicted character. After he has been showing how jealous he is regarding JG and Vienna, he runs toward Emma Small at the end like a bleating lamb, only to be drilled through the forehead for his troubles. Why does he run toward her during a gunfight? This is, after all, the Vienna-hating woman who caused the boy in his gang (Ben Cooper) to be lynched.

A couple of continuity problems exist in JOHNNY GUITAR, but the most notable occurs at the end when JG helps the wounded Vienna walk away from the cabin of the outlaws after she has gunned down Emma Small. (Early in the film, JG does his only vocalizing to accompany his strumming of the guitar when he intones: ""Her name was Emma Small . . . Emma Small."" This is a perfect commentary on the main antagonist, yet it passes almost unnoticed by the other characters.) When JG and Vienna leave the hideout area by walking into the waterfall, getting drenched still another time, JG is still wearing the gun-belt he acquired inside the cabin. However, after they emerge from the waterfall on the other side, the gun-belt is missing. Duh. Were you asleep on the job, continuity person?

Nicolas Ray is no slouch as a director. Maybe with this film he just decided to put his brains on hold while convincing himself that he was destroying a few western icons. Maybe, considering the time when this film was made, he succeeded. As I wrote at the beginning, this is a guilty pleasure, a film that is fun to watch in spite of itself. It is nowhere in the category of the great westerns like SHANE, THE BIG COUNTRY, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, and THE LAST FRONTIER, but it stands out as a significant film merely because it is different.

What I liked most about the movie is how it ended. So dramatic and over-the-top and in pure Joan Crawford cinema fashion! And usually at the end of an epic picture such as ""Johnny Guitar"" I am somewhat morose, but not this time. Because it's so beautiful and almost a celebration of the picture. I love how Johnny (Sterling Hayden) takes Vienna (Joan) and they kiss passionately under the waterfall as Peggy Lee's title anthem plays, then all of a sudden a huge eagle eclipses the screen with the words REPUBLIC imposed over it. So dramatic!

The film is important because it says so much. You can watch it strictly as a western and get a lot out of it. Or, you can sit and analyse the societal issues that plague both the Dancin' Kid's (played by character actor, Scott Brady) posse and Emma Small (Mercedes McCambridge) and her gang. And perhaps you'll see that this is a story of rich, verses poor, or a story of a lovelorn, bitter and scorned woman who will stop at nothing to spread her rueful hate because damn it if she's miserable she's going to make sure that everyone that gets in her way will be miserable, too.

Speaking of miserable, Mercedes McCambridge played the perfect adversary to Joan. No, the 2 didn't like each other because they were each desperately envious of the other (for very different reasons). And in many scenes this viewer could see such raw emotion that broke the 4th wall and spilled out in real life. (Watch the first scene with Joan on the steps and Mercedes standing in front of her saying ""I'm going to kill you."" That look in both of their eyes cannot be duplicated because like the galaxies in the universe, it is completely unique). I think if Mercedes McCambridge learned anything it's that you don't mess with Joan Crawford, when she's been the reigning drama(tic) queen for the past 30 years prior.

The coup de grce has gotta be when Emma scampers back into Vienna's and shoots down that huge, grand chandelier (that I think every Joan Crawford movie has). It wasn't enough that she railroaded Turkey (Ben Cooper) into betraying Vienna and it wasn't enough that she was about to have the 2 hung. Nope, this old (rhymes with) witch wanted to see Vienna's good time saloon burn as wild and hot as the hell-fire torch that she's held for the Dancin' Kid. (Or was all that just a rouse to hide the lurid lust that Emma really felt for Vienna...?)

Although in essence this was purely Joan's picture, there was something very intriguing about Mercedes McCambridge's character, Emma. Emma was the type of person who was desperate for love and desperate for attention; she wanted to have all eyes on her. But as much as she wanted to have people near her, that's how much she pushed them (all) away. I felt pity for her because she put up such a fight against Vienna, and although she played very dirty she still couldn't catch a break. Even her own posse was practically routing for Vienna. To me, the character of Emma is essentially more decisive than Vienna. Because Emma was a representation of what can happen if you let hate consume you. Like a disease it eats you up inside and it's all you can think about until you literally implode.

If you've never seen this movie you're in for a big surprise and even a guilty pleasure. And, if you have seen it then you've found a rare gem, that is cinematic gold, courtesy of the one and only, world-famed, Joan Crawford (may she rest in peace).

Watching this film was a very frustrating experience for me.  Given the director and the cast, I was expecting more from it than I got.  I have never been a fan of Joan Crawford's and nothing about her performance changed my view.  However, I am a great fan of Sterling Hayden's, I like much of Mercedes McCambridge's work, and many of the supporting cast members are favorites of  mine, e.g., Carradine, Dano, Bond, Borgnine, Fix.  I'm also a fan of Nicholas Ray---he made several of my favorite films, e.g., IN A LONELY PLACE; THEY LIVE BY NIGHT; ON DANGEROUS GROUND; REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, etc.  But, all that being said, I came away from this movie with the feeling that I had just wasted 2 hours of my time.  Sterling Hayden plays the title role and he seems to ""sleepwalk"" through the part.  He plays a former gunfighter by the name of Johnny Logan.  Logan has given up his guns for a guitar and is initially presented as a sort of ""roving troubador"", who now goes by the name of Johnny Guitar.  He has been sent for by Crawford's character, a women named Vienna.  Vienna operates a saloon/gambling house which she has shrewdly built directly in the path of a proposed railroad line; she stands to make a considerable amount of money when the railroad buys her out.  Ostensibly, Vienna wants Guitar to entertain in her saloon.  However, we learn that she and Johnny are old lovers who parted company some 5 years before---but the ""flame still flickers"" between them.  In the 5 year interim, Vienna has had several ""liasons"" with various men, the latest, and most important, plot-wise, is with Scott Brady, known as, ""The Dancing Kid""!  Brady is the leader of a small group of questionable characters.  When Brady learns that Hayden is Vienna's ""old flame"", the tension between the two men begins to build.  Opposed to Vienna are Mercedes McCambridge and Ward Bond, the two most influential cattle ranchers in the area.  They do not want the railroad coming through ""their town"", bringing ""nesters"" and ""sodbusters"".  It also turns out that the Brady character has been dallying with McCambridge, but has no genuine feelings for her.  McCambridge is absolutely feral in her hatred of Vienna and one begins to suspect that McCambridge's irrational hatred of her has more to do with a suppressed lesbian attraction than with the fact that Vienna has been involved with ""The Dancing Kid"".  Through the influence of McCambridge and Bond, Vienna is ordered by the local marshall to close down her business(in total disregard of her legal right to operate her business) and Brady and his gang are ordered to ""get out of town"" within 24 hours(in total disregard of their right to live anywhere they please).  Brady decides that if they are going to have to leave, they might as well rob the bank on their way out.  By the damndest coincidence, Vienna and Guitar happen to be in the bank conducting legitimate business when it is robbed.  McCambridge jumps at the chance to accuse Vienna of colluding in the robbery and a posse is formed to go after all of them.  By movie's end, Brady and his gang are all dead, along with McCambridge.  Vienna and Johnny Guitar survive to begin a new life together.  If this ""synopsis"" seems convoluted, try watching the film.  Despite it's reputation as filmdom's great, ""kinkily Freudian"" western(other than the Sapphic undertones, I found  nothing particularly ""kinky"" or ""Freudian"" about it---perhaps a professional psychoanyalyst could more intelligently discuss that ""supposed aspect"" of the movie), I found it to be tedious beyond belief.  The characters are all caricatures of western movie ""types"", the direction is ""wooden"", to put it mildly, and there is some of the worst dialogue I have ever heard in a film with such an ""A list"" director and cast.  The only ""good"" thing about the film is the Technicolor cinematography, which is gorgeous---otherwise, I found this film to be  a ""20 pound turkey""!",1257638400,2,4155,4.9167862266857965

It's difficult to describe how... odd... this film is, especially on the first viewing. There is total gender-role inversion, with Vienna (Crawford) and Emma (McCambridge) running roughshod over the males, who seem obliged to do pretty much whatever the females want. (One can't very well call them ""ladies"".) And, of course, The Big Shootout is between two women. I can't think of any other western with a female/female gunfight.

The acting is acceptable, with only McCambridge standing out for her almost plausible nutso-psycho turn. (One can imagine Catherine O'Hara in a remake.) Throughout most of the movie, Joan's facial expression suggests she's been receiving Botox injections between takes. The male cast comprises mostly well-known character actors, who no doubt took a look at the finished film and wondered how they ever got involved. Director Nicholas Ray (""Rebel Without a Cause"") has the good sense to play everything ""over the top""; the material demands no less.

One longs to see Carol Burnett, in Crawford drag, sashaying into her burning saloon to grab the bust of Beethoven. It seems only natural that someone named ""Vienna"" would keep a bust of Beethoven in her private quarters, right? (And let's not overlook Vicki Lawrence as Emma and Lyle Waggoner as Johnny.)

""Johnny Guitar"" would make a great double feature with ""Calamity Jane"" and its crypto-lesbian subtext. Two weird Westerns.

Distributor: Paramount (Although correct me if I'm wrong, but I honestly believe that Turner/Warner Home Video has their hand in just about all of Joan's films, even those that aren't from the MGM or Warners libraries.)
Director: Nicholas Ray
Runtime Listing: 110 mins
Color/BW: Color (Trucolor)
(Joan played: Vienna)
Brief Synopsis:
A lady saloon owner battles a female rancher out to frame her for murder.

And here's the main cast (actually, these are my favorites, from the main cast!:)
Joan Crawford ~ The Star of the Show ~ Vienna
Mercedes McCambridge ~ Emma Small
Sterling Hayden ~ Johnny 'Guitar' Logan
Scott Brady ~ Dancin' Kid
Ben Cooper ~ Turkey Ralston
Ernest Borgnine ~ Bart Lonergan
Royal Dano ~ Corey
Frank Ferguson ~ Marshal Williams

""Johnny Guitar"" is actually based on a novel by Roy Chanslor and is undisputedly the granddaddy of the Female Western Film, because it proudly serves as the original prototype of this genre. It's also a little known-fact that there really was a real Johnny ""Guitar!"" Johnny ""Guitar"" Watson was a well-known musician, who adopted his moniker after he saw Sterling Hayden play the title-role. Although, that's really where the similarities end.

...Vienna, a saloon owner of the Old Wild-West is just as tough and heavy-fisted as the men that frequent her establishment. Vienna's nemesis is the (almost) equally-equipped Emma Small. Emma wants to run Vienna out of town because she believes that she is a wanton woman that was behind her brother's death.

Ms. McCambridge was such an understated actress; I'm not sure why. Needless to say, I really enjoyed her in this movie. And, I loved those stare-downs that Emma gave Vienna. Emma looked at her like she was some finger-lickin' good tender-vittles! Perhaps, the real reason why Emma loathed Vienna so much was because Vienna wasn't interested. Vienna was hungry for meat, not flesh! But really, wasn't Emma totally digging Vienna like she was a bowl of fancy-fiest...? I honestly think that Joan, oops, I mean Vienna (wink wink) was not into chicks. She didn't swing that way (now the boys in this picture, that's a different story.) Maybe she patted a few bottoms and was a little touchy-feely, but that was about it.

This movie has many important messages, subtexts, subplots and perhaps even some hidden meanings. IMHO if you're watching ""Johnny Guitar"" and miss some of this, then you're really missing a big part of the element of this film. ...The battle of good over evil...

But, the main message that I learned, is that a gun and a woman with (severe) sexual-frustration is a very dangerous mix!

Perhaps the biggest difference between Emma and Vienna was that Emma was a nut, and Vienna was not. ...Instead, there really was something about Vienna that was so primal and perhaps even bent because I picked up that she was distraught, lonely and even desperate, at times. You could almost see her lip quivering as she barked out orders to her boys. She was also terrified of losing control. Perhaps, Vienna mimicked Joan. Frankly, I have always believed that at least a couple of Joan's hubbies had some sugar in their respected tanks which only made her more starved for a little bit of attention and affection. I'm sure she spent many nights alone, hating herself. Joan was the type of woman that loved being around other people and was petrified of being alone. She wasn't a picky lady; she just wanted to hear a heartbeat. What's wrong with that? Only a very cold person who is incapable of any type of real human emotion could not relate to her; Vienna and Joan, respectively.

Over the past sixty years, it's been intimated that there was a personal rivalry between Miss Crawford and Bette Davis. I have no idea if that's true or not, but I am certain of one thing; the personal hatred between Joan and Ms. McCambridge was very real (not to mention surreal!) And, that's what made their characters so absorbing and amusing. Anyone looking at them shoot each other down could tell that they each had pure spite in their eyes. Both ladies were desperately jealous of each other (both on the silver screen and off!) Remember, back in '54, Mercedes was still considered a young ing'enue who was hot after her Oscar win; I bet Joan wanted to wrap that nude golden-statue around her flabby little neck!

I also enjoyed Sterling Hayden and the legendary Mr. Ernest Borgnine. Both men were amazing actors (actually, Mr. Borgnine still is!) who are total geniuses when it comes to the theatrical arts. But another actor in this movie that I adored (at least more than any of the other guys,) is little Ben Cooper. Wasn't Turkey so adorable? He looked almost like the love-child of Jason Priestly and Jimmy Dean! I love how he'd try to play tough so the other big-boys would play with him; prompting Vienna to hiss, ""that's pretty good Turkey, for a boy"" in a condescending and hateful tone. ...What wound up happening to him was tragic because Emma only used Turkey for her own selfish need for self-gratification. But wasn't it funny watching Emma goad Turkey into ""outing"" Vienna. Did you notice that huge smile on Emma's face (as her eyes lit up like a Christmas tree) while she was trying to get Turkey to fess up? This woman was loving every second of it! And, frankly, so was I! (BTW, I included some pics of Ben Cooper from this movie on this page since I had a lot of difficulty find others, elsewhere.)

...Joan was a very kind woman who always looked out for her family, friends and fans. But, she could also be very competitive, especially where another woman was concerned. ...While filming the pickup scenes, Joan felt that Mercedes was getting away with murder. So what does she do? Joan runs into Mercedes' dressing room and cuts up her costumes in a blinding, seething rage! Hell hath no fury like Miss Crawford PO'd! Of course, no one had the balls to tell Miss Crawford to calm down! Although, Miss Crawford never publicly ""dissed"" Ms. McCambridge (or any of her colleagues, because that was totally unprofessional and a big no-no as far as she was concerned,) her counterpart was always more than happy to badmouth Joan to anyone who would listen, stating that she was, ""a mean, tipsy, powerful, rotten-egg lady."" Powerful is right!

Can we talk a little about the colors and the apparel chosen for this film? I really believe the colors were very symbolic. Did you notice Emma was dressed in green when she first confronted Vienna who had that monochromatic blouse on! And, I loved those cute bows (or are they ascots?) that Joan wore because it reminded everyone that even though she was the leader of the pack, after all is said and done, she was still, just a girl! I especially love the scene when Vienna was playing the piano, wearing that floor-length white gown. And did you see how she was playing the piano, she was so in to it! It was just so outrageous and in-your-face! It was like she was having this intense o-r-g-a-s-i-m (it's too bad Emma wasn't around, I'm sure she would have loved to have been a part of it.) Total narcissistic entertainment! The costumes for the boys didn't change much. I don't know about you, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothing sexier than watching a manly man strut around in a cowboy hat and skin-tight pants! And I loved that black funeral ensemble that Emma wore with the veil. So over-the-top and dramatic!! Wasn't it so funny watching her run around dressed like this with her gun in hand, ordering her boys to go after Vienna!

Another aspect (and perhaps a cause?) of the rivalry between Emma and Vienna (not to mention Joan and Ms. McCambridge!) was that both ladies were vying to be the almighty Queen Bee. And, although one can attempt to try, in the end it's futile because you just can't fit two Queen Bees inside a hive packed with men! And no matter how careful you are, no matter what happens, if you screw with the Queen Bee you'll always wind up getting stung! I absolutely adore the part in the beginning of the film where Vienna is standing on the stairs, in her saloon, and Emma says to her ""I'm going to kill you"" and Vienna says without flinching, ""if I don't kill you first..."" Wasn't Emma's voice so terrifying? She's was more scarier than Bea Arthur, Leona Helmsley and Ms. Barbra Streisand all put together! (BTW it's no coincidence that Ms. McCambridge was the voice of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Exorcist/dp/079073804X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Exorcist </a>, although, the poor thing had to turn around and sue just to get billed for this!) ...If I was a gambler, I'd put my money on Joan to win this barroom brawl! Because Joan's the Best of the West...!

Some of my favorite lines from this picture:

Vienna (to Johnny, after the bank holdup): You don't know her, I do.

Emma (to Vienna:) You're just a railroad tramp.

Vienna (to Turkey after he asks her what he should do when Emma & co. catch him:) Save yourself.

Emma (to Vienna:) Look at you staring down at us with that gun.

Emma (said to the Marshall and his men when no one will come forward to hang Vienna:) I will pay $100 to any man.

Vienna (to Emma's crew:) I've never done anything to hurt any of you, don't make me do anything now.

Turkey (said to Vienna in a very meek voice after he was badly injured:) Help me.

Vienna (said to Emma when none of the other boys will come forward and hang Vienna:) You're going to have to do it yourself Emma.

The Marshal (said to Emma after she asks him why they aren't racing to Vienna's to take her prisoner:) You have 5 years of hate, you can give my boys 5 hours.

I really love how the movie ended. It was just so dramatic, especially when the theme-song played and so beautiful, too. I think my favorite part was watching Vienna and Johnny kiss beneath the waterfall. It was so romantic.

This film was originally billed as ""Joan's Greatest Triumph."" I certainly don't know if I'd agree with that and I'm certain that if Miss Crawford could speak to us from up above she would thoroughly disagree with this assessment. Some fans have referred to ""Johnny Guitar"" as ""Mildred Pierce with a Gun."" But if Joan could hear them now she'd slap anyone silly for daring to mention her defining-film in the same breath as this one! Joan was always ashamed of ""Johnny Guitar"" and felt it disgraced her long and impressive film-resume, and sadly, she never forgave herself for making it. In the late 70's, when reflecting on her life and accomplishments, Miss Crawford could only remember her failures when asked about this feature film, ""I should have had my head examined. No excuse for a picture being this bad or for me making it."" (I love those quotes by the way, because it only makes me want to watch this movie even more!) But I am certain of one thing, if Joan is watching us above in heaven, she would be very pleased to know that there is an entirely new generation of fans who are totally turned on to ""Johnny Guitar"" and more importantly, to her!

So, go on and watch ""Johnny Guitar!""

However I hate to admit it, but ""Johnny Guitar"" is one of those incredibly rare Joan Crawford movies that I would have thoroughly munched on even if she weren't in it!

Oh, before I forget, here's the particulars of this cult-classic:
Johnny Guitar (May 27, 1954) (Studio: Republic)
Distributor: Paramount (Although correct me if I'm wrong, but I honestly believe that Turner/Warner Home Video has their hand in just about all of Joan's films, even those that aren't from the MGM or Warners libraries.)
Director: Nicholas Ray

Brief Synopsis:
A lady saloon owner battles a female rancher out to frame her for murder.

And here's the main cast (actually, these are my favorites, from the main cast!:)
Joan Crawford ~ The Star of the Show ~ Vienna
Mercedes McCambridge ~ Emma Small
Sterling Hayden ~ Johnny 'Guitar' Logan
Scott Brady ~ Dancin' Kid
Ben Cooper ~ Turkey Ralston
Ernest Borgnine ~ Bart Lonergan
Royal Dano ~ Corey
Frank Ferguson ~ Marshal Williams

""Johnny Guitar"" is actually based on a novel by Roy Chanslor and is undisputedly the granddaddy of the Female Western Film, because it proudly serves as the original prototype of this genre. It's also a little known-fact that there really was a real Johnny ""Guitar!"" Johnny ""Guitar"" Watson was a well-known musician, who adopted his moniker after he saw Sterling Hayden play the title-role. Although, that's really where the similarities end.

...Vienna, a saloon owner of the Old Wild-West is just as tough and heavy-fisted as the men that frequent her establishment. Vienna's nemesis is the (almost) equally-equipped Emma Small. Emma wants to run Vienna out of town because she believes that she is a wanton woman that was behind her brother's death.

Ms. McCambridge was such an understated actress; I'm not sure why. Needless to say, I really enjoyed her in this movie. And, I loved those stare-downs that Emma gave Vienna. Emma looked at her like she was some finger-lickin' good tender-vittles! Perhaps, the real reason why Emma loathed Vienna so much was because Vienna wasn't interested. Vienna was hungry for meat, not flesh! But really, wasn't Emma totally digging Vienna like she was a bowl of fancy-fiest...? I honestly think that Joan, oops, I mean Vienna (wink wink) was not into chicks. She didn't swing that way (now the boys in this picture, that's a different story.) Maybe she patted a few bottoms and was a little touchy-feely, but that was about it.

This movie has many important messages, subtexts, subplots and perhaps even some hidden meanings. IMHO if you're watching ""Johnny Guitar"" and miss some of this, then you're really missing a big part of the element of this film. ...The battle of good over evil... The battle to be the alpha male...  ...Trying just to fit in and be accepted... ...The socioeconomic division between Emma and Veinna's ""gangs""... But, the main message that I learned, is that a gun and a woman with (severe) sexual-frustration is a very dangerous mix!

Perhaps the biggest difference between Emma and Vienna was that Emma was a nut, and Vienna was not. ...Instead, there really was something about Vienna that was so primal and perhaps even bent because I picked up that she was distraught, lonely and even desperate, at times. You could almost see her lip quivering as she barked out orders to her boys. She was also terrified of losing control. Perhaps, Vienna mimicked Joan. Frankly, I have always believed that at least a couple of Joan's hubbies had some sugar in their respected tanks which only made her more starved for a little bit of attention and affection. I'm sure she spent many nights alone, hating herself. Joan was the type of woman that loved being around other people and was petrified of being alone. She wasn't a picky lady; she just wanted to hear a heartbeat. What's wrong with that? Only a very cold person who is incapable of any type of real human emotion could not relate to her; Vienna and Joan, respectively.

Over the past sixty years, it's been intimated that there was a personal rivalry between Miss Crawford and Bette Davis. I have no idea if that's true or not, but I am certain of one thing; the personal hatred between Joan and Ms. McCambridge was very real (not to mention surreal!) And, that's what made their characters so absorbing and amusing. Anyone looking at them shoot each other down could tell that they each had pure spite in their eyes. Both ladies were desperately jealous of each other (both on the silver screen and off!) Remember, back in '54, Mercedes was still considered a young ing'enue who was hot after her Oscar win; I bet Joan wanted to wrap that nude golden-statue around her flabby little neck!

Powerful is right!

Why isn't ""Johnny Guitar"" on DVD, yet? I don't understand; what are they waiting for? Fortunately, it's at least on home-video. And, it does come on television often; usually on TCM or Encore Western. But wouldn't it be great if the powers that be were to release a special edition boxed set? They could even interview some of the remaining cast. I know that Ben Cooper is still very much alive. Although, sadly Ms. McCambridge passed away 4 years ago (at the age of 87.) Keep in mind, there is also a non-region specific DVD from South Korea.

661497,5,6303391931,"""Johnny Guitar"" is a perverse and fascinating Western where sexual drive plays an important part in the story... It is known that Emma's madness/hysteria is a result of sexual repression... She detests Vienna, who has her choice of men, when the only man she can stir up herself is ugly Bart... And what is especially enraging for Emma is that while she is desperate for the Kid's love, Vienna, who now has Johnny back, turns the Kid away and still he doesn't stop being loyal to her... Even before Johnny returned to her life, Vienna had reached control over her sexual desires; but Emma hasn't such will power...

Johnny Guitar rides into a small town in the wilds of Arizona... He has been hired to work as guitarist by an aggressive lady of fortune, owner of a saloon-casino... Five years earlier they had been lovers, but he walked out on her, too restless to settle down...

There is a stage robbery, and a banker is killed... Emma Small (Mercedes McCambirdge), the dead man's sister, comes to Vienna's accompanied by the town marshal (Frank Farguson), and the wealthy rancher John McIvers (War Bond), and a bunch of vigilantes...

Emma and McIvers are determined to keep the area an open range for cattle... Emma also despises Vienna because the man she loves, the Dancin'Kid (Scott Brady), is attracted to her... She would rather see the Dancin'Kid dead than with Vienna, and tries to convince her companions that Vienna, the Kid, and the Kid's partners-- stingy Bart (Ernest Borgnine), sickly Corey (Royal Dano), and young Turkey (Ben Cooper)--are responsible for her brother's death and should be hanged... Neither the marshal nor her ally McIvers will go along with her without real evidence, but McIvers orders Vienna and the Kid's gang to clear out the town...

That night, Vienna and Johnny admit they still love each lover... They agree to start again, but neither is certain the other can be relied upon... Vienna doesn't like Johnny's violent nature and Johnny is jealous that Vienna has had many lovers...

The following day, the Kid and his three companions decide to rob Emma's bank - figuring that as long as they are being forced to flee the area it might as well be for a genuine crime and not a stage robbery which they had no part in... The bank robbery takes place just as Vienna was withdrawing her money...

Joan Crawford wears black and packs six-guns... She makes all the decisions, initiates the action, and takes the majority of heroic stands--Privileges traditionally denied women in Westerns... Vienna dreams of a railroad and a new town... She wants to remain neutral, and sit and wait for the railroad to come and make her rich... She is at her best when she refuses to allow Emma and the vigilantes to arrest her for the murder of Emma's brother... She sees herself still in love with Johnny... She searches his face in every man she mets... Now she finds it hard keeping the peace between the two men who love her...

As Johnny Guitar, Sterling Hayden is a loner with a past... His character struggles to control hostile impulses... In fact, he begins with true explosion that occurs when he rides across the screen... Soon he finds himself compelled to strap on his gun again to protect his love...

Dressed in a black funeral dress, Mercedes McCambirdge is a highly frustrated Emma who constantly reminds the cattle people that Vienna is a foreigner, having lived in the region only five years... Appealing to their bigotry, she warns them that if the railroad comes through as Vienna plans, dirt farmers will push the cattlemen out of the territory...

As the Dancin'Kid, Scott Brady is a left-handed-draw, leader of a wild bunch, whose only desire is 'to leave the town so broke.' He tosses a coin into the air, promising Johnny Guitar he'll kill him if it turns out ""head.""

Nicholas Ray will be always remembered for ""The Lusty Men,"" ""Run for Cover,"" ""The True Story of Jesse James,"" and ""Johnny Guitar,"" his first film in color... With great skill, he makes a fantastic Western with two gun-carrying ladies in a showdown to-the-death...",1163030400,2,4081,4.792318634423897

661499,4,6303391931,"Emotions run high in a small western town where the civilizing influence of the railroad has not quite arrived.  Untamed outlaws rob the stagecoach and the local bank, and frontier justice in the form of lynching is still a matter of course.

In the center of local controversy is Vienna (Joan Crawford), a woman who has used her wicked wiles to build enough capital to invest in a saloon where the train has plans to build a depot.  The locals are angry at the changes the train will cause in their lifestyle.  One woman in particular, Emma (Mercedes McCambridge), has  a maniacal jealousy of Vienna's flagrant sexuality, power and beauty.  Emma is driven to insanely accuse Vienna of every crime committed locally. The arrival of a guitar playing cowboy, a former lover of Vienna, does nothing to endear the locals to Vienna's cause.

The story takes place at the culmination of tensions in this town--every scene is played for maximum dramatic value.  In an intruiging introduction to the film by Martin Scorcese, he points out that the color scheme was designed to show primarily black and red to highlight its ""operatic sensibility.""  Directed by the iconic director, Nicolas Ray and played to the hilt by Joan Crawford and Mercedes McCambridge, Johnny Guitar fascinates in its intensity.

661501,4,6303391931,"JOHNNY GUITAR is a very enjoyable western melodrama with Joan Crawford, strikingly filmed in colour, as Vienna the misunderstood saloon owner who spearheads the drive for a railroad to be built through her small town.  She comes under the hatred and scorn of her fellow townsfolk, not the least of which a scary pariah called Emma Small (played wonderfully by Mercedes McCambridge in another of her trademark characters with bull-dyke tendencies).  Vienna's only help lies in her former love, Johnny Guitar (Sterling Hayden).  When Vienna is accused of taking part in a robbery it sets into motion a chain of events that could end in her lynching...

This film is a hair's breath from being high-camp.  Joan Crawford plays Vienna in her usual style, exchanging insults and threats with McCambridge in the film's most memorable scenes.  A choice line of McCambridge is ""She's nuthin' but a railroad tramp"".  Watching their scenes made me think of Faye Dunaway and Diana Scarwid in MOMMIE DEAREST, they seem to create the same energy on screen, perhaps they watched JOHNNY GUITAR in preparing for their performances?...

Which makes it impossible to overlook the fact that she is one of the least attractive(to put it kindly)leading ladies ever. She resembles a drag queen. And not a very passable one at that.,1128729600,9,440,4.7272727272727275
661503,5,6303391931,"Funny thing about Johnny Guitar, I've heard this said in some reviews that the actual character of Johnny Guitar is a small part of this movie. I've seen this movie many times and the character of Johnny Guitar is pretty much there from the opening scene to the closing. I think the character of Emma Small (Mercedes McCambridge) is the most intriguing. She is so incredibly jealous that she would rather see The Dancin' Kid, (Scott Brady) the man she loves and the woman he loves Vienna (Joan Crawford) dead before she can face another day of it. Look at Emma's face after she runs out of Vienna's Saloon after shooting down the chandelier and the saloon is on fire, she looks like a mad dog. We're told that Emma has five years of hatred in her and it is anything but hidden. Vienna has had a relationship with The Dancin' Kid but she made it clear that there is another man. Vienna is in love with Johnny Guitar (Sterling Hayden) whom she has not seen in five years but misses and loves him even though she has gotten very bitter about men, but with good reason. Vienna sends for Johnny Guitar because she misses him and she sees the hatred that has reached it's pinnacle with Emma and fears for her safety. In addition to Vienna being in love with Johnny, he will serve as a bodyguard because he is a professional gunmen known as Johnny Logan. Emma has a death wish for Vienna out of pure jealousy and has gotten the townsmen to believe that The Dancin' Kid and Vienna are criminals for crimes they didn't commit and seeks the only solution she has, hang em'. Vienna has big plans on the railroad coming though this town from a reliable source and plans on getting in early and capitalizing in the business market and has already established the saloon called Vienna's. It would appear she is very intelligent in this area and is in fact a very head strong woman who is a hardworking and honest person. I think this is one of the best movies ever made, it's basically a story of total gender reversal. I recently got a copy of this movie because I hadn't seen it in about 30 years, it was even better then I remembered. I gave this movie a 10 as it is a one of a kind and was overlooked by Americans in 1954 because they just didn't know what to make of it, had Americans seen this in a present day setting (Mid 1950's) and not a western setting they would have seen this movie simply for what it is and it would have been haled a CLASSIC from the get go. Some movies are just ahead of their time and this one falls into that category. It's amazing that in the year 2000 we can see this western style movie for what it is easier then they could have 45 years ago. It shows that Americans have become more open to new ideas and are willing to accept things at face value and not try to rationalize them. Two enthusiastic thumbs up.",1105833600,3,2834,4.318949343339587
661504,5,6303391931,"Two giant actress ; two strong characters, two Oscar winners : Crawford and Mc Cambridge play hard  and displace the man condition to invited guests . Both women will assume the action decide what is wrong and right , create her own conduct codes and fight for her happiness , never wait for the man decision , but vice versa.
But Nick Ray goes far beyond there is still more . Ray avails  this original gaze to illustrate the central dramatic nucleus : Emma represents the antique Status Q ; she opposes to the railroad  construction because it goes against her interests over the territory while Vienna is the progressive vision of business and knows the railroad will enrich her possession .
As you know both positions in conflict had been focused among the Indians and White men but never among two women .
Think it carefully and try to link this film with another one which is extremely related : Thelma and Louise . The first is a real combat ; the second is evasion . But both of two have many commons aspects . The man is relegated to a second plane . They only are stone spectators and only act as product of the circumstances ; I mean act reactively but never assume the control of the things . They are concerned around the effects not the causes.
Bernardo Bertolucci properly called this film ""The first of the baroque westerns"" and Francois Truffaut commented : It's not about horses and guns , it is about people and emotions"" while Andrew Sarris stated : ""Freudian feminism"" .
Based on Philip Yordan and Roy Chanslor `s novel this is to me one of three gems of Nicholas Ray in his emblematic career , the other two would be Rebel without cause and Bitter victory .",1103328000,5,1679,4.480392156862745

7848218,3,6303391931,"Joan Crawford may not always give her best or entertain with every performance, but in Johnny Guitar she quickly gains viewer attention with her garish appearance and thorny manner. She wears her eyes like a pair of over-alert decals, as if someone had been plucking her nostril hairs in between takes. And what lips!!! Picture a set of those red candy wax lips hastily being ironed over Crawford's own. Contributing even more to this intense image are her heavy, dark vampish brows, brows that have come to define her legendary image. Here, Crawford portrays Vienna, a saloon-owner with all the answers who won't take lip from anyone. If anyone dares to cross her, they can surely expect to be staring down the barrel of a gun. A few reviewers have likened her appearance to that of a witch, which wouldn't be too far off. Despite the cantankerousness of this she-devil character, there's something compelling about a female who can hold her own with the wild and wooly outlaws of the West.

Johnny Guitar's number one flaw is that it's saturated with overwritten dialogue. Not only do these hard-baked wisearse lines lead to stiff interactions, they also provide a prime breeding ground for cardboard characters. From time to time, this kind of dialogue yields unintentionally comical moments, especially when an avalanche of back-and-forth empty threats are uttered in the first third of the movie. Everybody's hustling the ""I know best...I'll shoot down anyone who gets in my way...and I'm going to live forever"" high horse attitude which either becomes silly or tiresome after a while, depending upon the viewer. Ironically enough, the illest-conceived aspect of the movie is that Sterling Hayden, the actor who portrays the namesake character (Johnny Guitar), happens to be the DULLEST figure in the movie! This lonesome heart-stealer who plays guitar only once during the entire movie is supposed to pique viewer interest and curiosity with all the personality of a Ken doll? Even Ernest Borgnine as a gun-toting hooligan or John Carradine as a lowly floater turn out to be more interesting. As a Western, it's passable and sometimes enjoyable, but it lacks twists and turns and is a bit too short in the action and excitement departments. Ultimately, Johnny Guitar is for the Crawford fan. For the Western fan (and anyone else), don't expect your adrenaline level to reach rushing mode unless you enjoy two women of ambiguous gender getting catty with words.",1524355200,,2466,5.044117647058823
