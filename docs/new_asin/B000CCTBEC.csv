8097610,5,B000CCTBEC,"This dvd is a work of audible art...and its visuals aren't too bad either.  Any one who wants an insight into what life was like for a person who grew from the lowliest level of society, with all of the troubles inherent with such a birthright to becoming the darling of Presidents and Dictators and such good judges of talent, the likes of which include Duke Ellington, should jump at the opportunity to purchase this dvd.  I promise you that you will thank me for making such a strong recommendation.",1400371200,,502,4.566666666666666
