8507270,5,B006ZV6WRI,"Abbado has the enviable reputation of being one of the world's finest Mahler conductors. This performance from 2004 is clearly one of great authority and is given with equal authority by Abbado's own creation, the aptly named Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra. This orchestra takes in players of up to 26 years of age drawn from players from the whole of Europe and is the result of annual extensive interviews held by prominent orchestral players in 25 European cities.

The orchestra is widely respected for its technical and musical qualities and has similarities in concept to the Lucerne Festival Orchestra which also recorded the work a little while later. There are, however, significant differences between these two performances and recordings that become apparent right from the start and which are generally maintained throughout.

This slightly earlier performance is markedly more dramatic and forthright with less emphasis on particular soloists and with an inevitably stronger full orchestral presence. The pulse is more strongly forwardly pressing. This can be easily checked at any point but is very noticeable from the start of the 3rd movement, the rondo burlesque, where the burlesque element is more forceful. All of this is delivered with total assurance by the orchestra and absolutely no allowances have to be made for the players' relative youth or lack of long-term experience. It is arguable, of course, that these aspects of the players may have influenced Abbado's approach to the interpretation. Whatever the reason, there is a real choice to be made between the two interpretations.

The recording is very fine indeed and the Blu-ray version is a clear improvement. The camera work is fully involving for the viewer and provides crisp imaging with good colour rendition.  The sound is very full and is presented in DTS 5.1 and stereo. It offers a markedly more forward balance than that provided for the Lucerne version. This suits the different interpretation and is a very exciting alternative.

The differences between the performances are very significant in my view. There are two contradictory views on what this music is actually about and it seems to me that Abbado's performance here lays less stress on the death-obsessed views that is currently favoured (as described in the booklet interestingly). This is crucial to one's views of the symphony and to how one might react to these two differing performances.

The following is a fair resume of the opposing camps as regards the content or intentions behind this music:

There are two main competing views as to what this music is about. Mahler, at the time, had just completed two very successful seasons as conductor of The Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic and in his last letters said that he was looking forward to going on tour with the NYPO. In addition he had made considerable progress with his 10th Symphony. None of this suggests a man approaching imminent death and beset by such fears and possible anger as some would have it. On the contrary, it rather suggests a man at the top of his game and looking forward to his future life and continuing success. Indeed, this rather optimistic point of view is the one generally held and put forward by the eminent Mahler authority, Henri-Louis La Grange.

When we consider Mahler's own comments and those of his closest colleagues of the Second Viennese School we find that Mahler himself denied that there was any program to his symphonies and asked that they should be judged simply as pure music.

In addition, Berg described the 9th as `It expresses an extraordinary love of the earth, for Nature'.
Also Schoenberg had this to say ` [The Ninth] contains what may be termed objective, almost dispassionate statements of a beauty which will be perceived only by those who can dispense with visceral warmth and who feel comfortable in a climate of intellectual coldness'

Not a word is mentioned by these three men as regards a focus on death. So where does this leave us when confronted by conductors who insist that this is the work of a man facing imminent death with many strong and negative feelings?

When considering the music itself it is clear that the first movement has many retrospective elements. The second movement, a rustic lndler, becomes distorted and frantic as it progresses. The 3rd movement includes the term `burlesque' in the title which musically simply means a parody. None of these ideas are unique to this one work by Mahler and there are countless other examples in his work of these compositional features. The last movement certainly seems to fragment during its course and finishes very quietly indeed but what else could Mahler to do in order to create compositional balance? He could hardly have ended with yet another quick movement.

To return to Abbado, all one can say is that within his own apparently contrasting concepts of the work he and his two orchestras deliver all that one could imagine possible. I personally have a preference for this earlier performance with the Mahler Youth orchestra as I tend to favour the view that this is not death-obsessed music of a dying man but rather an expression of hope etc. as Berg, Schoenberg, Henri-Louis La Grange suggest and very much the music of a man looking forward to more life. We must remember that Mahler himself denied that there was any program to his symphonies and asked that they should be judged simply as pure music

In summary and in my opinion this is a clear contender for the full 5 stars for all the reasons as above and should give much pleasure and satisfaction to all purchasers of the recording who share either of Abbado's visions of the work. My preference, owning both, is for this earlier, less inward and more forwardly dramatic concept. Both performances end in a whisper with the audience held in utter silence with dimmed lighting for a prolonged period of time.
