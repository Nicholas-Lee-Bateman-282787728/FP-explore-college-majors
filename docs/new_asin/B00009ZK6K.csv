The narrator as it was mentioned from the earlier review did a pretty awful job in pronounciation, particularly with the O' Sensei's name. The disk itself obviously was home made and you can tell by the paper disk label.

But I must say that despite the quality of its production, it's still definitely nice to see the master in action. The quality of some of the footage may be really old and faded. But I think that it's still good for what it is.",1133740800,6,541,4.303921568627451
7994583,2,B00009ZK6K,"Apparently, the editors of those old PBS specials made in the 70's are still around, because they definetly pulled them out of the works for this. The quality of the disk is revolting. It could very easily have been made on a home computer. The sound quality is sloppy, the narrator is practically useless, and his pronunciation of Japanese words and names is bad. The information could easily have been read from any easily found website. The techinical value of this DVD is not worth thirty dollars. The value of the footage of Ueshiba, on the other hand, is priceless. If you haven't seen him in motion, you will find yourself deeply moved. I would recommend watching this one with the volume muted.",1104278400,12,702,4.715447154471545
