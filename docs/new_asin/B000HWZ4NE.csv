8141734,4,B000HWZ4NE,"What a brilliant cast! This group of young people are all outstanding. 10 young actors and not a bad apple in the bunch. This is one of those stories that is told to us and we don't need anything blowing up or the like. The stories by each of these kids is compelling and draws you in. I would be very hard pressed to choose any of these actors that shines but if I had to....Daniel Letterle and Billy Kay. They were awesome. But again everyone delivered. The older cast, too, delivered but was almost incidental. A teacher breaks his debate class into 5 groups of 2 and the interaction is what drives the stories. The los of the one star? Well, I loved Dale Midkiff as the debate teacher BUT the side story of him and his father (Beau Bridges) was annoying. Sorry, the kids stories were the more compelling.",1435536000,,808,4.357615894039735

8141736,5,B000HWZ4NE,"This is a movie about a debate teacher who makes a huge difference in his students' lives-not the civil war! The student challenges his debate students to think for themselves and to consider both sides of the arguments, even if they might feel strongly against it. (i.e., he asks a black student to speak out in favor of slavery) This movie will make you appreciate any teacher who made a huge difference in your life.

Among the pluses were the overall quality and the extras included, as well as the viewing experience.",1373846400,,522,4.673913043478261
8141737,3,B000HWZ4NE,While it was no great storyline. I didn't fall asleep. Nice story about students being taught to challenge themselves. I bought it just because David Letterle was in it.,1368316800,,169,4.862068965517241
8141738,4,B000HWZ4NE,"This is one of the best movies that I've ever watched. The movie was stellar, and depicted teenagers who were focusing on very interesting debate topics, while learning to work together and deal with their own personal lives.
There are quite a few inappropriate words in this picture, but if it weren't for that, I would have give it a 5 star rating.",1231977600,,350,4.571428571428571
