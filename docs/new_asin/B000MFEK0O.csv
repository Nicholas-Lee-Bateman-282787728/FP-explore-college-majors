8325400,5,B000MFEK0O,"This is the best documentary that has been produced on this topic and probably the wider world's first introduction to the plight of honor killings in the Arab Middle East. First screened on Cinemax in 2000, it is now available as a DVD.

I use ""Crimes of Honour"" in my college-level classes on Islam as part of the segment on Islam and Human Rights. The documentary provides a very balanced, yet terrifying look into the Jordanian penal code where a clause allows those who commit crimes of honour/honour killings are given lenient sentences for the murder or no punishment at all. The documentary aims to debunk the myth that honour killings are exclusively an ""Islamic"" phenomenon, rather the documentary approaches the idea from a sociocultural angle, looking at the notion of honour as it is rooted in Jordanian society.

The documentary's strengths lie in the highlighting of actual cases of honor killings, especially the story of the murder of Rania Arafat. Rania was accused of losing her virginity to a boy who she had run away with to marry, rejecting the cousin to whom she was betrothed. When she was lured back to her family after her mother called into a popular Jordanian TV show in Amman, she was murdered by her younger brother, much to her family's joy. There are also chilling interviews with a pair of sisters whose elder sister was stabbed to death and men who have committed honor killings. The documentary also includes interviews with activists like Jordanian Times journalist Rana Husseini.

In addition, the documentary approaches the problem of modernization of social mores and its reconcilation with traditional religious values (both Muslim and Christian) in the Arab World.",1183852800,5,1705,5.017667844522968
