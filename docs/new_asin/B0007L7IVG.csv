8158192,5,B0007L7IVG,"In 1997 Columbia House released a 10 pack VHS set of Petticoat Junction containing a total of 40 episodes.  The tapes are not in chronological order but are gathered together by theme i.e. ""Somethin' Shady Goin' On"" ""Queen Bea"" etc.  While not the greatest way to release the series, at least the hereto before never syndicated black and white Petticoat episodes were finally available for viewing.  The Columbia series presents clean, crisp prints with great sound.  As many fans of the series are aware, MPI released the first half of the 1963-64 series on DVD but has not seen fit to release the remainder of the show as of 1/07.  Thus for those diehard fans, the Columbia House VHS remain the only authentic reproductions of the show.  BEWARE of the bootlegged copies being sold at Amazon.  These tapes and DVDs do not contain the theme song and appear to be very poor copies.",1167609600,2,880,4.712418300653595
