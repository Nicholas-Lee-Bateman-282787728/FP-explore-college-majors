8454352,4,B0052SO11E,"I may be biased but this Joseph H Lewis western is one more in the category of underrated Lewis Directed, B-Movie must-see(s).
You probably must be a fan of Joseph H Lewis and have already seen Guncrazy (1949), The Big Combo (1955  and agree it is his best) and, especially, Terror In A Texas Town (1958) - Lewis other black-and-white western - to appreciate THE HALLIDAY BRAND (1957).
Actually, some may be relieved to know the HALLIDAY BRAND is grittier and less quirky than Terror In A Texas Town.
The camera work by Ray Rennahan is darker than his still effective work on the more minimalist work on Terror In Texas Town for Lewis.
The cast is a definite plus, too, and even though I agree Joseph Cotten and other old pro Ward Bond don't give their best performances just their presence alone help this well made (small but effective sets) B production.  As a matter-of-fact I noticed the Bonanza Cartwright family comparisons quickly (Bonanza was not on tv yet).  There is one sister instead of a third brother; and, again, this HALLIDAY clan is going through a much darker time as the patriarch of this family (Ward Bond) is basically much more bigoted than Ben Cartwright ever was on Bonanza tv show.
Also, Viveca Lindfors is nothing short of stunning portraying a half breed indian, proud of her native heritage (despite actress not trying to shake her Swedish accent!) whose own brother draws her closer to the Halliday brothers.
Throw in some spirited pre spaghetti western type vocals-music and this should be considered more of a trend setter than THE HALLIDAY BRAND is rarely credited.

8454354,3,B0052SO11E,"Well done western with Joseph Cotton as a son who can no longer stand his heavy handed sheriff father and his bigoted ways and attempts to break free of him.  Bill Williams (TV's Kit Carson)  is a brother who stands by the father, Ward Bond, until he realizes what his father is and his manipulative ways.  Betsy Blair is the sister whose half-breed lover is allowed to be lynched by the father because he had Indian blood in him.",1413072000,,430,4.417721518987341

8454356,3,B0052SO11E,"There are indeed dazzling and miraculous moments in this western directed by the always surprising Joseph H. Lewis. The bare-hands fight between Daniel Halliday and his father is of the most oedipal interest, Lewis' mise-en scene is very elaborate and the director likes to place his camera in unlikely positions. Everything is not perfect but The Hallyday Brand deserves more than a polite attention. Recommended.",1325808000,3,414,5.384615384615385
