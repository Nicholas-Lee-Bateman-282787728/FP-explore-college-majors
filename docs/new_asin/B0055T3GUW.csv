4581057,5,B0055T3GUW,This is a very carefully produced DVD with warmup exercises and 8 lessons of Tai Chi.  Very impressive.  I enjoy using it.,1361750400,20,122,4.5
4581058,5,B0055T3GUW,"I would reference this video a thousand times over Dr Paul Lam is awsome he touches over everything in this video and he is so pacient he goes very slow so that you understand what is going on Tai Chi is a ver complex style once you get in depth with it, I would also refer this video to people that would like to learn Tai Chi Chuan Tai Chi for beginners is the best way to go, it will also help you on the move and it will strengthen your steps when preforming Tai Chi. I would rate this ten stars if I could.",1357171200,38,511,3.876190476190476
4581059,5,B0055T3GUW,"I am taking Tai Chi lessons and I bought this dvd to practice at home as my instructor uses Dr Paul Lam's techniques.  I found that I understand the movements much better when using the dvd at home than in the class.  Dr Lam instructs you very slowly and clearly; the movements are more precise and simplified.  You are able to go back and repeat a lesson if you are not confident that you are doing it correctly.  The warm up section is great for gaining balance, confidence and peacefulness.  If all I have time for are the warm up movements and lesson one I still have a calm, relaxed feeling when I head out the door. One of the best things about this dvd is that you can practice over and over again in the privacy of your own home and not be concerned if you make a mistake; you can just keep moving and do not have to be concerned about keeping the pace with the rest of the class.
I purchased this dvd from Amazon.com and I am completely satisfied and happy with the purchase!",1351123200,101,984,4.212765957446808

4581067,1,B0055T3GUW,I expected to be able to access all eight lessons but was only able to access lesson one. Later I found that this product is identical to a limited introductory version that is free on YouTube. I felt ripped off by the purchase.,1504915200,,228,4.325581395348837
4581068,4,B0055T3GUW,"Dr. Lam makes several DVD's about Tai Chi, so I was happy that I ordered the right one. I had been watching an Introductory lesson w/Dr. Lam on You Tube and my only disappointment was with the quality of the DVD.  It looks like a ""copy of a copy"" rather than a first edition print.  Also, I don't seem to be able to play the DVD on my Sony PC computer.  Overall, I am very satisfied with the Tai Chi for Beginners DVD.  Thank you.",1504051200,,430,4.023529411764706

4581106,1,B0055T3GUW,"I watched the first lesson of this instruction on youtube and decided this would be an easy introduction to Tai Chi. I just received the DVD today, but was not happy that the clear plastic on the outside of the DVD cover was already ripped open at the top, the label looked old and stained, and there was not the usual seal to indicate this was a new DVD that had not been previously used. Unlike a movie, I am not going to watch this DVD all at once; I certainly hope that as I go through the lessons I don't discover that this copy has a flaw and was returned!  I paid for a new copy and got a used one. Boo! This DVD was shipped by Amazon.com directly from Dr. Paul Lam Tai Chi products in Lexington, KY.",1475452800,,707,4.05

4581124,5,B0055T3GUW,It was just what I was looking for. Easy simple instruction at a nice slow pace. It make you slow down and lowers your blood pressure just watching the video. I especially like the warm. up exercises to do on a daily basis. It only takes about 10 minutes and slows you down and stretches you out.,1459555200,2,296,4.2105263157894735

4581127,3,B0055T3GUW,"Dr. Lam explains basic Tai Chi clearly and slowly, in a friendly manner, with a lot of repetition, so this CD is good for beginners like me. Exercises are often presented with one person facing you, and the other facing away, which is good when you are trying to keep left and right straight. Unfortunately, the virtue of the presentation is also its main problem. Once you start to learn, the slow-paced repetition of basic moves becomes tedious. I haven't tried other Tai Chi methods, so I don't have anything to compare this too. I would not try to discourage someone from trying it. You just have to be ready with time and patience--which is sort of what Tai Chi is about anyway, isn't it...?",1450742400,18,696,4.576

Both my husband and I were newcomers to Tai Chi.  As senior citizens, we were unsure if we'd be able to learn to do the basics.  We have now (pretty much) mastered the basic movements in a short time, and have just purchased the 24 Forms video by Dr. Lam as our next step.

Because a great deal of the video involves Dr. Lam explaining how to do the moves correctly and adjust for physical issues, being able to understand the dialogue is rather essential to using it.

I liked the Amazon Prime version a lot, though. This is a good approach to Tai Chi for all physical issues (including rehabbing needs) and it is good.  If you are expecting something like an aerobics video where you just follow along, this  (and Tai Chi in general) will not meet your expectations, since mindfulness is a crucial part of it.",1417737600,12,636,4.601769911504425

4581203,4,B0055T3GUW,"This is a solid DVD for anyone considering a start in Tai Chi. Some of Dr. Lam's explanations are a bit wordy, but you can work around that with the menu.  This is very easy to follow, AND I love that he shows you how to do the moves while his back is to you.  The only thing that was not so great is that in the review area, they only repeat the move once, and say that you can go back and keep watching it, but that means each time you have to stop and hit play again on the menu. A loop of the move, 10 times, would be better for practice.",1397865600,3,542,3.745614035087719
4581204,5,B0055T3GUW,"Everything is done slow and it is easy to follow, and the steps are explained very well . I like the message explaining what TaiChi is all about.",1395100800,2,145,4.214285714285714
4581205,5,B0055T3GUW,If you have no previous Tai Chi experience and no access to a live class/instructor (the very best way) then this is the place to start. This DVD and the book (two separate items) will get you started and give you a taste of what Tai Chi encompasses. Dr. Lam is THE way to go.,1391731200,4,276,4.036363636363636
4581206,5,B0055T3GUW,"Love this, so easy to follow. Great instructions first Tai Chi dvd i am able to follow . Will be buying next DVD.",1390953600,2,113,3.9565217391304346
4581207,4,B0055T3GUW,"It is good approach to headlines (lessons)
It goes easy and slowly- step by step.
I am still in the 1st lesson - real beginner",1390348800,,126,4.08
4581208,4,B0055T3GUW,I'm 65 and overweight.  This CD is easy to follow and my knees felt better after the first try-working on motivation to continue!,1388880000,8,129,4.608695652173913
4581209,5,B0055T3GUW,A good basis for learning Tai Chi.  Dr. Lamm really takes the time to explain each move thoroughly. Slow but sure.,1379203200,2,114,4.428571428571429
4581210,3,B0055T3GUW,"There were many good things about this DVD and these lessons - but for people like me with small rooms in which to practice, they really didn't quite work.  If you have a small house or apartment with rooms more like 13x15, which also contain furniture that can't be moved (like me), this DVD isn't for you.  I kept getting halfway through an exercise and then bumping into furniture, no matter where I started.  Dr. Lam's ""Tai Chi Anywhere"" works better for small spaces.",1378598400,29,472,4.595238095238095
4581211,5,B0055T3GUW,"WAS REDCOMENDED TO ME, HAVE NOT USED IT AS MUCH AS I WOUL LIKE BUT MY INSTRUCTOR SAID IT WAS THE BEST FOR BEGINNER",1375056000,2,114,3.7916666666666665
4581212,5,B0055T3GUW,"I rate it highly because it shows the demonstrators as they face you, and as they look away.  Their movements are easily to follow.",1373587200,10,131,4.458333333333333
4581213,5,B0055T3GUW,"I have taken Tai Chi in the Chuan style & very much enjoyed it but had to quit, do to health concerns, & it is like starting over again for me.  I saw the Tai Chi for Beginners by Dr. Paul Lam, on You Tube, & watched the video.  I decided that was for me, at the age I am now & also the physical condition I have.  Once I am confidant that I am proficient in this version, I plan to buy the Tai Chai for Arthritis.  I love the way Dr. Lam teaches.  He is slow &. methodical.  This is very important to me.  Had I not seen it on You Tube I would never have known it existed.  I live in a rural area & if I don't find it on the computer, it doesn't exist for me.",1371772800,3,660,3.631205673758865

4581215,3,B0055T3GUW,still complicated for an older person like me who has had history of stroke.  i agree with the author to be better off to see a trainer,1369440000,,135,4.0
4581216,5,B0055T3GUW,"Great video.  Easy instructions and easy to follow.  Also includes more in depth information, if you want to learn more.",1366848000,,120,4.95
4581217,5,B0055T3GUW,I really liked Dr. Lam's instructions & I look forward to learning as many Tai Chi movements as I can,1366502400,,101,4.1
4581218,3,B0055T3GUW,"This is a good way to learn what Tai Chi is all about. My only complaint is before each lesson there is several minutes of unneccessary explanation. What I mean by this is instead of just the warming up and starting of each lesson, there is a lot of wasted time in my opinion. I just skip through to where I want to start, so it's not that difficult to watch, more of a nuisance.",1362700800,18,379,4.066666666666666
4581219,5,B0055T3GUW,"I tried taking a class in Tai Chi, but found I was getting frustrated; not able to get the right moves.  Bought the DVD from Dr. Lam and let me say, it is amazing.  Easy to follow, easy to understand, and easy to learn the moves.  Patience is the key, which is perhaps, opposite of what we are taught in our present culture.  The rewards are wondrous.  Not only does this method improve balance, but there is something mystical incorporated in Tai Chi that extends into everyday living.  Something that everyone has to explore for themselves.  Yes, I would highly recommend this DVD.",1362528000,52,583,4.601941747572815
4581220,4,B0055T3GUW,"It's great for a beginner and the second DVD, 24 forms, expands on the ideas perfectly.  I'd recommend it to anyone, particularly seniors",1362441600,25,137,4.956521739130435
8458755,5,B0055T3GUW,"This is just at the level I wanted, rank beginner who has a hard time memorizing physical movements. It's quite pleasant. It doesn't give the full form, but goes into the building blocks of the form, which is perfect for me.",1528761600,,224,4.487804878048781
8458756,5,B0055T3GUW,Great video for beginners in Tai Chi.  Use it each morning for stretching.,1528243200,,74,4.6923076923076925

8458758,3,B0055T3GUW,"I like the teacher, but the design of the menus in the DVD is terrible.  It would be better if there were more small chapters so you didn't have to fast forward so much to get what you want.",1526428800,,190,3.871794871794872
8458759,5,B0055T3GUW,I watches this instructor on you tube and then went to amazon and I was so glad I was able to find his tai chi for beginners.  I want to improve my balance for a lifetime.,1522800000,2,171,3.75

8458763,5,B0055T3GUW,Video gives very clear instructions and demonstrations of forms. Of other videos I have watched this one was the easiest to follow,1517702400,,130,4.954545454545454
