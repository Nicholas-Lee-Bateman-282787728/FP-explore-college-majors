The screening is just beautiful it looks amazing you can really see the details Im glad they remastered such a great show. Im glad I purchased this, I missed out on this when it first came out in 2011 but now I can enjoy this! and for great price to. Id recommend this to anyone Id definitely give this a 10/10",1524787200,,473,3.9894736842105263
8491508,2,B0062VPCZE,"It has Single Track English Audio and No Subtitles .. but DVD version has Subtitle with Multiple Audio Tracks ( French / English ) ..
Video Resolution is HD (1920x1080) but they didn't remastered it so well you see noises on the picture .. it is not a True HD Video
besides you may not able to play this with North America players ( you will need a free region player ) ..
Disappointing ...",1492819200,3,390,4.213333333333333
