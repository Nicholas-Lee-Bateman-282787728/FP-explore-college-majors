8379669,4,B002SVP9JG,"This is a French/Liberian film, based on the novel `Johnny Chien Mechant' by the Congolese author Emmanuel Dongala. It follows a group of boy soldiers fighting at the end of the second Liberian Civil War in 2003, the platoon is led by Johnny Mad Dog, who does not even remember his former life or his real name. He is the eldest at just fifteen. The rest range from ten to fifteen and some were actually former boy soldiers, so this has its' authenticity credentials pinned firmly to the mast.

It stars Christopher Minie who plays the title character, and he is led by General Never Die on a rampage across Liberia heading towards the capital Monrovia, which is still being held tentatively by the Dogo tribal government. This is inter racial genocide up close and far too personal. The children are armed to the teeth and wear all sorts of clothing that they have pillaged from their fellow countrymen. These range from a white wedding dress to a pair of angel wings. The surrealness of the attire juxtaposes deliberately with the wanton and brutal violence that they inflict. This is both physical and sexual and happens throughout.  General Never Die uses all sorts of techniques to influence the boys, from basic threats to voodoo and cocaine - the latter seeming to stoke the violence more than any other `training technique'. They are systematically dehumanised, but actually show great consideration for each of their platoon members. That small piece of compassion is not enough to engender empathy though, as they are all deeply unlikable. Even though you know they are the victims of stolen innocence, they still use their imaginations to create fear and torture their victims.

They have all been given weird names, such as `No Good Advice', `Captain Dust to Dust' and `Chicken Hair', this obviously to distance themselves from their former lives as real children. The UN are shown as pointless and toothless, a theme that runs through too many tales of modern conflict. There is a sort of love interest, but as that is an emotion in very short supply, it struggles to work on the screen. However, this film will draw you in and it is very immediate, sometimes feeling like a documentary and the pace does not let up for the full 94 minutes, so a lot of praise to director Jean-Stephanie Sauvaire.

It has been criticised for not being a fully developed film with plot twist aplenty etc. However, that was never the intention, if you want to see more of this type of film then you could try `The Silent Army/Wit Licht'<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Silent-Army-Wit-licht-White-Light-NON-USA-FORMAT-PAL-Reg-2-Import-Netherlands/dp/B002HFZB2I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Silent Army  Wit licht  White Light  [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 2 Import - Netherlands </a>], it is more human but less believable for it. This is not an excellent film, but it is an excellent attempt to bring the tragic stories of child soldiers to the attention of the wider world - very recommended.",1317340800,,3030,5.084507042253521
8379670,4,B002SVP9JG,"""Johnny Mad Dog,"" based on the book by a Congolese writer Emmanuel Dongala, is not an easy film to sit through because of the nature of its central theme: child soldiers. Set in the last days of the second Liberian civil war (1999-2003), the French-Liberian film (co-produced by Mathieu Kassovitz, ""Ameri"") is basically about two children in the then war-torn Western African country: a child soldier nicknamed Johnny Mad Dog (Christophe Minie) in charge of a small group of child soldiers; and Laokol (Daisy Victoria Vandy), a young girl trying to survive and protect her young brother and legless father.

Johnny himself is under the command of the elder and ruthless soldier ""General Never Die,"" who brainwashes the children using chanting or even drugs to make them fearless soldiers. In this case, ""fearless"" means pillaging and even killing. The film discreetly avoids too explicit descriptions of violence, but it is still shocking. The desperate situation is best described with the General's own words: ""You don't wanna die, don't be born.""

This is the first feature film by director Jean-Stphane Sauvaire, who actually went to Liberia to audition the non-professional performers (and many of them are former child soldiers) for the roles. He shot the entire film on location in Liberia, and these facts help make the film look (sometimes disturbingly) realistic.

Like a 2002 film ""City of Gods,"" ""Johnny Mad Dog"" attempts to mix the documentary-like realism with the gritty character-driven drama. The result is largely successful, though the film sometimes feels drawn out. The subject matter has been covered by Edward Zwick-directed ""Blood Diamond,"" but the ways the films deal with it are totally different.

""Johnny Mad Dog"" is a realistic war drama with an emphasis on war. Those who are interested in the subject matter, one of the serious aspects of the modern warfare, should not miss it.",1296777600,7,1909,5.148387096774194
