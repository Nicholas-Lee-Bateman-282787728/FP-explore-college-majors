And this DVD isn't expensive, so you can't go wrong if you buy it!!!!!!!",1230854400,,250,4.340425531914893
3681895,5,B001L8DB8S,"I think this is yet another great production by Drake. I love the ""sneak peeks"" of ""Sea Song"" and ""All Alone At the Disco"". Drake also does some great covers. I just love ""Joining a Fan Club"". I've been a fan for two and a half years and I can really tell how much better he has gotten at performing, as well as singing. To respond to the 1st post, I think the fuzziness is intentional because Drake likes the ""vintage look"". He says that in many different interviews.",1230595200,2,468,4.269662921348314
8317554,5,B001L8DB8S,"Very good concert although  the video appeared a little grainy. It may be the way the director wanted it, which is what I think. Still a great concert and brings out the energy Drake Bell brings to his live performances. I would recommend this to all DB fans!",1325980800,,259,4.395833333333333
8317555,5,B001L8DB8S,my neice flipped over this. i think it is great too. it is what you expect from their show and character.,1238371200,,105,4.0476190476190474
8317556,5,B001L8DB8S,My daughter is a big fan of Drake Bell's music. I watched the video with her. Not only is his music good but he covers some great songs (a few from Brian Setzer) and does it well! This DVD is sure to be a fan favorite!,1235779200,,218,3.760869565217391
8317557,5,B001L8DB8S,"The delivery was on the dot and the dvd itself is totally awesome.
Drake is fantastic the songs are amazing and catchy while being cool the visual is a little grainy at times and could have used a little bit more polish up and the camera person could have done a bit better on closeups but other than that it was totally awesome.  I've seen Drake in concert and he was super but I wasn't sitting very close so this was so completely fantastic to see him close up they should have had a little more about what he did off time and talked to him a little bit more and maybe a little more interaction off stage with his fans and band but I would totally reccommend this to anyone who loves great music and entertainment.  And the fact that Drake is so good looking and has the advantage of being a superb actor is just juicy cake for the extremely delicious icing.  To all who enjoy great music ENJOY.",1234137600,,897,4.233918128654971
8317558,4,B001L8DB8S,"Great concert. Drake Bell is a very talented musician that is better than most give him credit for due to his tween girl fanbase.

I loved the show.",1233792000,,148,4.285714285714286
8317559,4,B001L8DB8S,"If you enjoy Drake Bell, you will enjoy this for your collection. Good sound quality and the songs are all wonderful. There are short interviews with Drake in between each song which is cool. Drake never seems to change outfits.",1233014400,,228,4.725
8317560,5,B001L8DB8S,"I bought this, along with 2 Drake CD's, for my 4 year old son for Christmas. He loves Drake and Josh, and has developed a very intense love of all things music. Well I am pleasantly surprised to report that I may love Drake more than my son! I never expected such great music out of this kid (I'm 24, so I'm probably part of his target demographic anyways). Drake is a truly talented musician, I'm amazed by the depth, beauty, and energy of his songs. This movie, or any of his CD's for that matter, are a must have for those out there who love to explore obscure or undiscovered talents!",1231977600,7,588,4.258928571428571
