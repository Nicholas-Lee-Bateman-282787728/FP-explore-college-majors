2332208,3,B0009X7678,"This review is for the 2005 Twentieth Century Fox DVD.

The film opens in a ""MASH"" unit near a World War II battleground where a wounded George Taylor (John Hodiak) slowly realizes that he has amnesia.  Rather than confront the issue head on with the medical staff, he decides to try to regain his identity by using all of the people around him for feeding information about himself.  When he is finally discharged from the military, he goes to Los Angeles to piece his past life back together.  He later discovers that a friend he doesn't remember named Larry Cravatt left him some money at a bank.  When George goes to the bank to withdraw the cash, George has reason to believe that the police are after him and flees the bank and then has to do a lot more detective work on his own.  This sets up the rest of the film where the stakes suddenly are much bigger than he ever imagined since he discovers that he may have been involved in a murder that was tied to $2 million worth of missing money.

Beyond the obvious issue of suffering from amnesia and refusing any medical help, the story goes off into a long string of highly improbable events that don't seem that well connected to each prior event.  The main character just seems to have an uncanny knack of falling backwards into some other fantastic situation.  In spite of these problems, the film does a few things right.  First, it's a clearly a film noir movie set mostly in the seedier parts of Los Angeles and photographed with plenty of shadows and darkly lit settings.  Another nice touch is that just about all of the supporting actors are recognizable characters from the classic film noir era.  Even though the film has some of the necessary ingredients for success, the script is disappointing since it doesn't connect the dots that well from one scene to the next, and doesn't thoroughly sell the audience on several key points of the movie such as the main male character (Hodiak) and his relationship with the leading female character (Guild), the surprise villain, and how uncreatively the villain is brought to justice.  Overall, I think classic film noir fans will still find the movie rewarding based on the visual presentation, but mystery buffs will be holding their noses with this plot.

As for the DVD, the black and white full screen presentation is overall excellent.  The picture is sharp and with superb contrast.  The only minor problems were some graininess and occasional tiny signs of film deterioration, but considering the film was made in 1946, it's a great transfer.  The DVD bonuses include commentary by noir author Eddie Mueller plus several other Fox Film Noir trailers.

2332209,3,B0009X7678,"Despite weaknesses in this film it has enough good qualities to recommend.  For starters, despite layered plotting and red herrings the script telegraphs it's inevitable conclusion.  The film's leads, John Hodiak and Nancy Guild, though attractive are merely serviceable.  The film though does boast great atmosphere with it's use of shadowy cinematography and seedy L.A. locations.  The film also has a better than average supporting cast in Richard Conte, Lloyd Nolan, Sheldon Leonard, Harry Morgan, et al.  This one is a tough call because the potential is here for a better than average noir.  If you're a completist of Fox's noir series like I am you're obligated to purchase it.  Otherwise, rent it or wait until it pops up on TV.",1128902400,2,736,5.033057851239669
2332210,4,B0009X7678,"The predicament with amnesia, besides the obvious loss of memory, is the confusion and disorientation that the individuals experience while trying to get a grasp with reality.  A simple direction might be more impossible than the most complex of riddles, as there is no coherent foundation to lean on in regards to previous experiences.  Names, locations, and knowledge are only foggy symbolical representations of the unknown while only adding more bewilderment within the individual.  Thus, amnesia presents a terrific opportunity to create film noir, as the loss of cognitive processes induces an ominous and mysterious atmosphere that does not let its grip go of the audience.  Somewhere in the Night offers such an experience where a man drifts out of hazy unconsciousness to find himself lost in his own existence.

An angled rear shot of a man's head and an upside-down IV-bottle on which the words ""Normal Human Plasma, Dried"" fade in after the appearance of director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's name.  Symbolically, the shot suggests immediately that something is wrong, as the inverted bottle is an icon for hospitalization and illness.  Furthermore, the overturned text of the bottle hints toward the notion of a puzzled existence of a normal human being.  Thanks to Mankiewicz's inspiring direction the film's first shot facilitates mind provoking suspense, as the camera slowly pans to the left displaying a small military hospital tent with some severely injured and a disheartened man covering his face in his hands.  An unpromising future arises within this initial scene where death, injury, and hopelessness metaphorically present itself through the bleak future that many injured soldiers faced in military hospitals.  It is clear that Mankiewicz understands the film noir spirit, as he offers such a meticulously planned first scene that sets the mood for the rest of the film.

After the pan the camera smoothly focuses in on a man who wakes up out of his injury-induced sleep discovering that he cannot move his mouth, or remember who he is, while other than people address him as George Taylor.  He has no other choice than to assume that he is George Taylor (John Hodiak), as he recovers from his severe injuries at the final stage of the war.  He becomes a civilian shortly after the end of the war, but he has very few clues about his identity other than his name.  The lack of concrete evidence is unnerving and troubling to him, as it only makes him more suspicious about himself and whom he can trust.  In addition, it is even more bewildering that he has a hard time uncovering the truth about his own identity.  The only thing that is certain with his situation is that something is wrong when he begins to investigate himself.  The first clue that he follows only adds to the perplexity of his situation when he finds another clue in a gun, a bank account with $5,000 (at the time it was a large amount of money), and a name.

Somewhere in the Night cleverly applies the concept of amnesia in a well-made film noir experience with a vague and ominously pensive mood even though the story might seem a little implausible.  The camerawork and framing of several scenes augment the doomed atmosphere, as the protagonist seeks the truth.  George's search keeps the audience guessing, but never completely sure about what has happened in the past, as he exposes new hints of his identity.  Not only does Mankiewicz capture the tone of film noir through George, he embodies the theme of noir in an utterly exceptional manner.  Every aspect of the film raises dubiousness: the characters, the hero, the plot, mise-en-scene, and the location of the film.  There is nothing left to chance, as Mankiewicz provides a truly extraordinary cinematic experience that offers amusement, suspense, and contemplation.",1127260800,10,3825,4.9984227129337535
2332211,3,B0009X7678,"Movie: ***  DVD Transfer: ***  Extras: ***1/2

A mystery with film noir elements, ""Somewhere in the Night"" tells the story of an amnesiac WWII veteran (John Hodiak) who sets out to recover his prewar identity, only to learn that he once may have been involved in a crime that culminated in an unsolved murder.  Yet despite this intriguing premise, the film never really jells because the script is both confusing and overlong, and because Joseph L. Mankiewicz's direction lacks the proper pacing and control, which causes the suspense to dissipate before the somewhat obvious climax (this was only his second directorial effort, following ""Dragonwyck"").  It's a pity, really, because there are so many things about this movie that do work:  Norbert Brodine's brooding cinematography is superb; the costumes, set decorations, and art direction are particularly stylish; and there are wonderful performances from Richard Conte, Margo Woode, and especially Lloyd Nolan as a smooth detective and Josephine Hutchison, who makes her single scene in the movie a standout.  The two romantic leads, John Hodiak and Nancy Guild, give acceptable performances but would have benefited greatly from tighter direction.

Like the movie itself, Fox Home Video's presentation of this somewhat obscure noir is lacking.  Although the video contrast is generally commendable, there are several scenes in which the graininess of the transfer is distracting, and there are one or two sequences in which the film is plagued by vertical lines of video noise (especially during the opening credits).  The sound, however, is crisp and clear throughout.  The extras include a commentary track (which I did not play), the Original Theatrical Trailer, and the trailers for three other Fox noirs, including ""The Street With No Name"", and the soon-to-be released ""Where the Sidewalk Ends"" and ""No Way Out"".  Although I can't in all good conscience give ""Somewhere in the Night"" an enthusiastic recommendation, I can tell you that despite its faults I enjoyed watching it, and that if you're a film noir or mystery buff ... or a Mankiewicz completist ... there's a good chance you will find something here to like as well.",1126396800,20,2190,5.2079772079772075
2332212,5,B0009X7678,"In the style that Alfred Hitchcock made famous, John Hodiak is a man who has no idea who he is. He comes back from the war looking for a man who might help him reclaim his past, only to find that everyone else - hoodlums, police - would like to find this guy too. Of course, there is the Lauren Bacall/Grace Kelly look alike (this before Grace) to believe in him and help him. You are caught up in seeing the story from Hodiak's point of view and being as baffled as he is. Maybe there are holes as the major reviewer has said, but while the story is unfolding you are having a whale of a good time. An extra bonus is the acting of the other players, Lloyd Nolan and Richard Conte at the top of that list.

But once you get past that you'll find a near-perfect noir, with an ingenious plot, appealing performances (Richard Conte stands out in the first of many parts as a slick gangster) and a snappy script.

2332226,4,B0009X7678,"... he, let's just call him he for now, was just another G.I., another guy doing his bit for the war effort on some nasty Pacific atoll, or some coral-scratched beach-head trying to do the right thing. Then it all came part, came apart in some desolate fox hole, when that son of Nippon, unnamed, unknown, unhated except he was one of Tojo's boys, tossed that grenade and he, in a split second, a split second of fear, bravado or hubris, take your pick, decided that his number was up and pulled his big black- haired, brown- eyed frame over the damn thing. And then came the surgery, and more surgery, and, and, the problem of no name, no name in a name-full world. Amnesia, damn. So he bought into the name they gave him, George Young, the name they scratched together for him and he went out into the harsh California day, not a care in the world, and maybe some luck would fall his way when he stitched together his mislaid past.

In the end he should have gone maybe to North Dakota or someplace, some place where guys weren't looking to knock him off, he didn't have to dodge a stray bullet or six, and didn't have to deal with every crack pot in the California night from low-rent floozies looking for the main chance to broken down carny con artists with hard boy companions not afraid to pull some rough stuff, trying to put the big step-off frame on him. But that was after, and that North Dakota, or some place, before would have meant that he missed meeting Christie, Christie the nice frame , flame- burning torch singer at the Kit Kat Club, the only one who had faith in him, was in his corner when even he had doubts. Yah, Christie.

Naturally if guys are looking for you, tough guys, whether you remember your past or not, they sure as hell do, when, what else, dough is involved. Big dough, big 1940s dough, maybe not much now, maybe just walking around money,  a couple of million bucks ferried out of Germany as the rats started seeing the writing on the wall and wanted  to insure a bright new life in America, or some place not bomb-out Berlin. But when that kind of money is involved lots of hands are going to be looking for their share, or the whole pot, and guys are going to end up dead. Watch out George, watch out.

As guys start taking a run at our boy George, and as guys who could help him figure out who he was, what he did,  starting falling through the cracks, and he started to understand why people were clamming up on him, except darling thrust-throated Christie, he began to see where his past life might have been ill-spent. That the George Young thing was just a hoax he had perpetrated on the world and that he was Mister Larry Cravat, either a patsy or a stone-killer. But no guy who is crazy for torch singers can really be all bad, all balled up as he may have been. So some stone-cold killer is out there with his number on his mind, and his mind on the dough.  Larry get the hell out of there for Chrissake.

...and hence this film",1358985600,,2977,4.3130590339892665
2332227,4,B0009X7678,"Some of the installments in the Fox Film Noir series don't really deserve to be called film noir, but this 1946 movie about an amnesiac trying to unravel clues to his past life sometimes makes a self-conscious effort to join to club, and it succeeds admirably despite some deficiencies in both the plot and the acting of lead John Hodiak. Hodiak, who as a high school kid turned down an offer to play with a St. Louis Cardinals farm team because he had only one ambition: To be an actor. Sadly, his style is too stolid and boring here, and the compelling elements of this film draw almost entirely on the plot. The story's grand arc really sizzles with mystery and a sense of impending doom -- Hodiak's character crosses paths with a mysterious foreigner, hoodlums, the police and assorted characters, all of whom have an interest in an enigmatic man who apparently was a close friend of Hodiak and who was connected with a missing treasure. Hodiak's determination to get to the bottom of it all without admitted to his amnesica and virtually without any help is perhaps a bit of a stretch, as are a few coincidences which help things along, and that's not even with a few loose threads that are still lying around at film's end.

2332231,2,B0009X7678,"""Somewhere in the Night"" is a confusing and verbose film noir, an early directorial effort by Joseph Mankiewicz. With uncharismatic John Hodiak in the lead as an amnesia victim, the film is a mishmash of confusion punctuated by some of the dumbest lines ever handed to a leading lady, starlet Nancy Guild, a Gene Tierney look alike.  There are isolated good moments and some excellent supporting actors but the overall effect is tedium and disorder. This film needed stars like Bogart and Bacall and a director like Howard Hawks to pull it off!  A ruthless editor would have helped too.

The print of the film is excellent and since film noir has such a cult following, the DVD gets a commentary from noir expert Eddie Mueller. Mueller is realistic about the film's weaknesses.",1236816000,,777,4.827067669172933
2332232,4,B0009X7678,"OK, as film noir goes this isn't ""Double Indemnity,"" but ""Somewhere in the Night"" is well worth a look anyway.

It's pure B-picture noir, the sort that made your mother or grandmother run down to the local movie house and shell out a couple of bucks for the full double-bill and come home happy that they did. There's not too much heavy social commentary and, as noted elsewhere, this is one of those convoluted amnesiac plots that have been so over-worked by Hollywood.

Still, a somewhat green director Joseph Mankiewicz, in one of his first solo runs well before he hit his stride in ""All About Eve"", and the strong cast of John Hodiak and Nancy Guild manage to pull it off, with plenty of atmosphere and some good crackling dialog (and a few wonderful little in-jokes woven into the plot, if you're quick and clever enough to catch on).

Another thing about this film worth seeing, besides Mankewicz's solo effort, is John Hodiak, who regrettably died at age 39. Had he lived a little longer I suspect he'd have found his way into the pantheon of great leading men, and we'd have this little gem to point back to as the start of a wonderful Hollywood career. Unfortunately for us, it never happened.

2332237,4,B0009X7678,"""Somewhere in the Night"" is a film noir that was released, appropriately, in June 1946, shortly after World War II ended. Its protagonist is a recently discharged veteran returning home. Not surprisingly, instead of a placid, welcoming environment, he comes home to confusion, violence, and fear. George Taylor (John Hodiak) was injured when a grenade exploded, breaking his jaw and relieving him of his memory. Lying in veterans' hospitals with his jaw wired shut, unable to speak, George passes the time wondering who he is. After recuperating, he returns to his supposed home town Los Angeles in an embittered state of mind. Searching for clues to his identity, he retrieves a briefcase he left in storage 3 years ago. In it, he finds a letter stating that $5,000 was deposited in George Taylor's bank account by a Mr. Larry Cravat. George sets out to find Mr. Cravat, the only person who might be able to shed some light on his identity. But inquiries about Cravat only get him beaten, threatened, and suspected of murder. Dumped on the doorstep of pretty young nightclub singer Christy Smith (Nancy Guild), George confides in her. Christy enlists the assistance of her boss Mel Phillips (Richard Conte) and Police Detective Kendall (Lloyd Nolan) to help George find Larry Cravat and his own identity.

You would rack up quite a score counting the conventions of the noir style and themes present in this ""Somewhere in the Night"". But as foreboding as it may be at times, this film doesn't take itself very seriously. Director Joseph Mankiewicz has included some joking references to the dark crime films from which ""Somewhere in the Night"" takes its queues. There is an ongoing joke about detectives in movies always keeping their hats on, because Det. Kendall takes his off as social custom requires. And a vampy, villainous woman makes a reference to killing her colleague for ""double indemnity"", apparently a reference to the 1944 film ""Double Indemnity"". It might not be a coincidence that the character who delivers the line is named Phyllis (Margo Woode). Still, ""Somewhere in the Night"" is dark when it needs to be, incorporating themes of identity confusion, paranoia, persecution, and isolation into a detective story and romance. Nancy Guild makes her silver screen debut as sweet-but-smart Christy Smith, who brings logic and a level head to George's panic and frustration. ""Somewhere in the Night"" isn't a sophisticated film noir, but it's satisfying.

The DVD (20th Century Fox 2005): There is a theatrical trailer (2 min) and an audio commentary by film noir historian Eddie Muller. Muller discusses the film's amnesia, detective, and paranoia themes, the very recognizable supporting cast, the coincidences that move the plot along, and a variety of other trivia. It's a worthwhile commentary, but I'm not sure that Muller likes this film very much. I get the impression that he finds it too cliched. But it wasn't so cliched in 1946. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish.",1150416000,13,3015,5.040080160320641

Actor John Hodiak (who bears an uncanny resemblance to Val Kilmer...) plays his role with a sleepy-yet-cool reserve -- for a guy who thinks he's just an average joe, he sure seems to handle himself well when things start getting weird and dangerous in his old hometown of LA.  Lee Strasberg (later of the Actor's Studio) delivers a compelling though flawed script... The first half of the film has an odd, stylish charm -- the flip, tough-guy rhetoric of the genre is tempered with a hefty dose of absurdism and playfulness.  There are some great sequences and fun, zippy dialogue, although the prologue is far superior to the action part of the film.  The second half lumbers along, and while it becomes clumsy, it's still entertaining and definitely a notch above many B-grade efforts of the same era.  One particular treat is an extended role for Lloyd Nolan, who plays a too-cool, insouciant police detective -- his introduction is a real hoot, where he effortlessly steals the scene and leaves the audience wanting more...

 Okay, let me amend and adjust that endorsement.  I didn't recognize John Hodiak at all, although author Eddie Muller tells us he was a fairly well established star in the mid-40s on Muller's entertaining and informative commentary track. A quick internet search of his name disgorged a number of movies I've seen that Hodiak has been in, including a couple I like a lot. Hodiak plays a weary soldier in the good Battle of the Bulge movie `Battleground,' and he's one of the washed aboard survivors in Alfred Hitchcock's `Lifeboat.'  Hodiak, about 30 when SOMEWHERE IN THE NIGHT was made was square shouldered, jut jawed, and seemed to favor a trim Clark Gable moustache.  In appearance he was something of a cross between Don Ameche and Martin Landau, I guess, with a voice that reminded me of George Raft.  I'm writing this in detail because, if this is Hodiak laying it out as a lead star, I'm certain to disremember him the next time around.  SITN is future Oscar-winning director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's first feature, so maybe that explains why he allowed his male lead to play it so... tense for the duration.  It doesn't help much that Mankiewicz cast 19-year-old newcomer Nancy Guild opposite Hodiak as the female lead.  Hodiak, stiff as shoe leather, doesn't have nearly enough in his own cache of charisma to wipe the deer-in-the-headlights look off Guild's face, much less pump a cubic ounce of air into a scene.  Confirming a couple of mistily formed suspicions, Muller tells us Guild was hired by Fox to be their Lauren Bacall.  Doe-eyed sultresses were big back then, at least Bacall was, and Guild was certainly pretty enough to roll the dice on. Unfortunately she's more animated in her publicity stills than she is when the cameras are rolling, the shadows looming and the cigarette smoke curling.  Guild's scenes alone with Hodiak are about as exciting as watching two people read a telephone directory to each other.

 The leads are pretty awful and the plot, after the army medic unwraps the bandages from Hodiak's reconstructed face, is serpentine and confusing as heck.  But the dialogue is snappy, Mankiewicz was a great writer, and the supporting cast is simply wonderful.  Austrian actor Fritz Kortner plays an unscrupulous fortune-teller named Anzelmo and steals every scene he's in.  Of course, he's not in any scenes with Lloyd Nolan, who plays a wise-cracking police detective and steals every scene he's in.  Throw the always reliable Richard Conte into the mix as a night club owner, plus Harry Morgan, Margo Woode (if Conte and Woode had been cast in the leads this one would have been a certified classic,) Sheldon Leonard, et alia, and you have an incredibly strong and entertaining line-up.  If SOMEWHERE IN THE NIGHT succeeds, and it does, it's because of the great script and over-competent supporting cast.  Hodiak is stiff and a little detached, while poor Nancy Guild... well, as Muller says somewhere, she does try awfully hard.  The plot's impossible to follow, the dialogue sparkles, and Kortner, Nolan, Conte, and the rest more than make up for the weak leads.  A reasonably strong recommendation for this enjoyable flick.",1136764800,40,3441,4.925476603119584
2332241,5,B0009X7678,"John Hodiak always reminds me of a pre-Travolta John Travolta, and his little mustache here exactly matches his sergeant's stripes.  Nancy Guild is sultry, take-charge, jokey and terribly young.  Her movie career didn't pan out the way it might have, and yet there's nothing to be ashamed of among her credits.  GIVE MY REGARDS TO BROADWAY and BLACK MAGIC are especially good, and she's excellent in both.  In SOMEWHERE IN THE NIGHT Hodiak and Guild make a great screen team, one I wish had been repeated in other films.

Eddie Muller's commentary is sparse, considering his great reputation as the Czar of Film Noir.  Over and over again I kept expecting him to mention things which even I knew.  Repeatedly he tells us that ""this sort of nightcclub is a staple of film noir,"" or ""a crooked fortune teller is a staple of film noir.""  While he stops himself from saying what he apparently feels, that the film is a string of cliches, what we want from a commentary is not an analysis of how the film is similar to all others in its category; we want to know why it is different.  He knows a lot about the movies, he just seems too casual to show it off.  And he knows a lot about Mankiewicz, so I wonder during the film's extended Salvation Army scene, why he never thinks to compare it to similar scenes in Mankiewicz' later GUYS AND DOLLS.  That would have made all the difference in watching it.

And he's also maybe too macho to tell us much about Anderson Lawlor, the failed Hollywood actor of the 1920s whose producing debut this was.  Muller mentions that Lawler was a ""friend of Tallulah Bankhead,"" thus he has an indirect link to John Hodiak, with whom Bankhead co-starred in LIFEBOAT, but surely Lawler's notoriety as one of the few openly gay actors in Hollywood, and his status as Gary Cooper's ""maybe"" boyfriend could have been mentioned, if only to help illuminate some of the darker corners of SOMEWHERE's mise-en-scene, like that opening hospital tent scene, man after man in bed after bed, each one better looking than the next, or the scene in the ""Elite Baths""?  How do such scenes play out in light of Lawlor's biographical melodrama?  For more details on Lawlor, interested parties mioght consult William Mann's BEHIND THE SCREEN: HOW GAYS AND LESBIANS SHAPED HOLLYWOOD 1910-1969, or JACK LAWRENCE'S recent memoir THEY ALL SANG MY SONGS.",1135728000,8,2358,4.70316301703163
2332242,4,B0009X7678,"WW2 Combat veteran John Hodiak wakes up in a Honolulu military hospital with his jaws wired shut, face bandaged, and memory totally gone in the solid Joseph Mankiewicz directed film-noir ""Somewhere in the Night"".

After a long convalescence he heads to Los Angeles based on a letter he has in his possession from a friend Larry Cravat.  He learns that his name is George Taylor, as it is inscribed on his wallet.

He begins asking around for Cravat in a local nightclub and immediately becomes the focus of mayhem courtesy of some shady locals. Hodiak meets and then confides his plight to nighclub singer Christy Smith played by attractive brunette Nancy Guild.  She refers him to her boss Mel Phillips played by Richard Conte who helps by introducing him to slick L.A. detective Don Kendall played by Lloyd Nolan.

We learn that Larry Cravat and two million dollars have mysteriously disappeared three years ago.  The plot proceeds chronicling the revelation of the identity of Hodiak and the whereabouts of the money.

While the film was nothing outstanding, it certainly was a convincing drama with satisfying storylines and acting performances.",1135382400,3,1149,5.0476190476190474

8069029,5,B0009X7678,"A great gem of a film noir about a soldier in WWII who due to injuries incurred in the war becomes amnesiac. Once he becomes well, he returns to the city not knowing even who he is, only to discover that he has been implicated in a crime. In the way he meets the lady who will become his greatest help in remembering who he is and in finding himself and how to get rid of the sins of the past and start all over again, in other words in finding redemption. There are a lot of twists, turns and a big surprise at the end. The scene at the Salvation Army at the end has a great hidden significance that adds a great flavor to a wonderful film. I like the Great acting talents and the decency in these films. There are no sexual scenes, no foul language even when the whole story runs around crime and intrigues. I wish they could return to make movies like that instead of the trash that they heap on us and call movies. A great movie to watch with the whole family.",1484438400,4,964,4.078947368421052

It is quite enjoyable in fact. This was the 1940's, the war was finally over and people needed to relax after all that sacrifice. The returning vets were starting to re assimilate into civilian life  and Hollywood had a slew of new heros to showcase.....war vets. I don't have many John Hodiak films but I do have his last one , ""On the Threshold of Space"" , the one he was making when he died suddenly before it was finished. Give the guy some credit, at least he seemed genuine. AND, it is true that the supporting cast more than make up for the leads fallacies. Just enjoy the film and don't worry about probabilities.",1437955200,,788,4.324324324324325
