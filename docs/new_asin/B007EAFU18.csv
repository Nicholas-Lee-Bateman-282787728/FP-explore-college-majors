5079337,5,B007EAFU18,This is an excellent British Series.  Maxine Peake is excellent as Martha Costello and so is Neil Stuke as the manipulative Billy Lamb.,1394668800,6,135,4.869565217391305

8515138,5,B007EAFU18,Enjoyed seeing some of the series 1 programs on educational tv and wanted series 1 and 2.  These are region 2 and require a non standard dvd player.  Played great.,1455753600,,163,4.4

8515140,5,B007EAFU18,"I have thoroughly enjoyed the episodes of SILK. shown on PBS, and wanted to see those that were left out. Each set has 6 episodes, for a total of 18 episodes.

8515143,5,B007EAFU18,"One of my top 5 favorite series.  The acting is superb, stories compelling and characters interesting and complex.  Well done series from top to bottom.  So sorry to see it end....",1434240000,2,180,4.741935483870968
8515144,5,B007EAFU18,"Started to watch this when it aired on my local PBS but found Maxine Peake too irritating.  However, after seeing her great performance in 'Criminal Justice 2', decided to give 'Silk' a second look; and, I'm very glad I did.  The stories hold my interest throughout.  Rupert Penry-Jones ('Spooks', '39 Steps'); Neil Stuke ('Game On', 'The Bill'); Phil Davis (2007 'Midsomer Murders'; 'Nicholas Nickleby') and Shaun Evans ('Endeavour') are all wonderful but, for me,  Ms Peake is still not credible and is painful to watch.  This is still an outstanding series and I look forward to the third season.",1428624000,2,599,5.01010101010101
